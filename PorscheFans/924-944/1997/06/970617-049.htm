My experience at Sebring Drivers' Ed events is that my 951 is faster than
all 911's up to the 993. The RS America is close. My car is an '87 with a
chip. At autocrosses, I hold my own with most 911's, but we run a MacDill
AFB in Tampa and set up big courses. I think the 951, including the non-S
951's, are Porsche's best kept secret as far as performance is concerned.
Every time I go to Drivers ed, there will be someone there with a late model
911 that just can't believe that there is a 944 eating his lunch. After
about the second session, they give up and start pointing me by. I have a
good friend that does a lot of PCA racing with a 95 993 that is set up with
1100 lb springs all around, Penske double adjustable struts, and cockpit
adjustable sway bars and a tweaked engine, (not to mention a substantial
ego). In a moment of complete candor, he commented to me a few weeks ago
(after returning from Road Atlanta) that he couldn't believe how fast the
Turbo S 951's are.

How's that for an unbiased answer!

Mike
