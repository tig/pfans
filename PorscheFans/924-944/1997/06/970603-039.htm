I called Red Line and asked for technical help. Got a nice lady who
told me that they suggest their 75W90 oil for Porsche LSD transaxles.

I asked her what makes the additives they use for the limited slip
safer than the Mobil 1 75W90 WRT brass and bronze in the transaxle.
Her response was that the Porsche is a different animal and for "normal"
cars they would not suggest an additive-rich lubricant for the transaxle.

I think this means that we don't really have to worry about the synthetics
eating our synchros. I'll go back to sleep now.
