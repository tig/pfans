well, that is a tough choice. the easy part is forget the S2. of those three
choices it is the 968 or the turbo S. the turbo S will be the fastest and
will also have the most potential to increase if you ever want to make it a
real super kick ass car. however, the 968 will be the most drivable on a
daily basis since the power band is so much smoother. those are both great
cars. i think you cant buy either based on future value, you have to deicde
what you want to do with the car and then see which suits your tastes. if you
tell me just want you want to do with the car for the most part i can try to
give you some more advice. best of luck - Doug
