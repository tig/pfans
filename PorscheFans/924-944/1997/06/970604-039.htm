nope, I have heard it called the best handling production Porsche ever
(excellence magazine a few months ago) and the engine is supposed to be
great...
the vario-whatever camshaft thingee is supposed to be awesome, though I
have no idea what it does...

For a Porsche, or any German car for that matter, the production run looks
pretty short, but the interior is the exact same as my 1987 944, so it was
probably not that big a deal to shut down production... I bet production
was in the low thousands...

It's gotta be sales, I think Porsche almost went bankrupt in the early
90's... not because of the 968 (read world economy, Lexus, SUV), but at any
rate, things had to change... they really really sweated on the Boxster and
it shows... I'm so in love with the Boxster I can't stand it...

remember, the Rx-7 and the 300zx are dead cars now too... the market changed...

also, nothing personal, but I am no fan of the rear end... I remember
thinking "ick" when I first saw one years ago, before I was into Porsches,
so, at the time, I was an impartial street observer... somebody else on the
list mentioned the headlights as being a styling quirk, but I like the
headlights... styling is just one of those things...
