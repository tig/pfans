First and foremost, read the FAQ.  When finished, read the FAQ again...  It 
contains some great wisdom on what you can expect to go wrong (and it will go 
wrong).  I use my 944S as a daily driver (except in the winter), and have had 
a great experience.

That's because my expectations were set correctly, however, by my previous 
924.  When I bought it, I expected to have to do the belts and rollers, the 
water pump, maybe a clutch, and on the outside, a transaxle.  It had 66,000 
miles, and as it turns out, all it needed was belts and rollers, so I consider 
myself lucky.  That's not to say I haven't spent thousands on routine and 
not-so-routine maintenance in the last few years, but again, my expectations 
were that such was necessary.

I've had a radiator hose 'blow', the cam timing was messed up, I spent $$$ on 
tuning, Swepco, performance mods, and stereo upgrades, but I'm also the kind 
of guy who looks in the dash vents and sees a screw missing and drives over to 
the shop that afternoon for a replacement.  The severity of your 
wallet-vacuuming will depend on how much of a dope the previous owner was, so 
be careful.

You can't beat it for fun and head-turning ability...  You just have to be 
prepared for the upkeep.
