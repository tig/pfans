I have had my '94 968 since 1994 when I bought it off the showroom floor 
and haven't had a single problem.  It now has 28K miles. Go ahead , you 
can't go wrong! In fact, I bought the 968 over a 911 because I had a 
feeling that years down the road it will be a much more desirable car as 
there aren't that many out there due to its short production run.  I 
think it will be much more appreciated later, much like the 914 which 
today is enjoying a strong popularity at the tracks.  When I had my 914 
in the earky 70's , I never thought that they would be as popular 
as they are now or that people woul dwant them 25 years later.
