Since asked, I will speak from personal experience and a recent 
tear-down.  The Mobil 1 synthetic 75W90 works great in 944 
transmissions, with and without LSD.  I have used it for years and have 
been very pleased with the feel/action of the transmission.

I did a tear-down of my transmission, which had about 97K on its 
original bearings, many many track dates, no oil cooler.  The car is an 
87 944S.  There are four tapered roller bearings which are, along with 
synchros, the critical wear items.  The two differential carrier 
bearings were perfect, as was the front pinion bearing (in the aluminum 
case).  The rear pinion bearing showed its age on the form of some 
minor pitting.  (The rear pinion bearing carries most of the load, as 
the ring/pinion action tends to push the pinion away from the ring.) 
 All were replaced nonetheless (since I was paying!)

I can't address the GL4 vs. GL5 issues.  I can tell you that the shop I 
frequent uses the Mobil 1 75W90 in all Porsche transmissions they 
service, to the best of my knowledge.  The 944 transmission does not 
have any bronze or brass bushings or bearings in it.  All the bearings 
are taper-roller, needle-roller, one straight-roller, and one ball 
bearing.  Except for the taper-rollers, the bearings pretty much last 
forever, not really stressed a lot.

I'll step up ever so briefly to the soapbox and tell you something that 
*will* ruin your bearings: not changing the transmission fluid every 
couple of years.  I've had the pleasure of going through a bunch of 944 
transmissions with junk bearings, pitted, galled, and because of filthy 
fluid.  The fluid breaks down, absorbs dirt, probably absorbs moisture, 
it gets nasty.  My fingernails are all black tonight from wiping down 
the insides of ones of these beauties in prep for a rebuild...
