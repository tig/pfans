Subject:  Porsches

Hello Porsche Fans,

I've been getting the list for almost 6 months and it has helped me
tremendously in learning more about my '87 944 which I have owned for
little over a year as a daily car (oh my God, did I say 'daily' and 'Porsche'
in the same sentence (ha!ha!))  This list is such a great source of
information!

But the main reason I'm writing today is about Porsches, in particular the
944. The reason why I have a 944 is because I've always loved the cars
and finally had the opportunity to own one (which is nice about the 944,
a middle income person who has a family can own this beautiful car and
be associated with Porsche).  Granted, they're not cheap to maintain or
to repair (probably cheaper than a drug habit (ha!ha!)), but, to me,  its
worth the price. This brings me to the one question I have for anybody
who buys a 944 and then wants to modify with AMERICAN V8s, body
upgrades, suspension upgrades, turbo upgrades etc... WHY?  Leave the
car alone!

To me, the 944 is a beautiful car period!  It doesn't require
mods/upgrades!  Why change its looks or character!.  Unless your
racing, why upgrade?  Porsche has taking care of the upgrades for
non-racing owners.  If you have the 944na and want more HP, save and
buy an S.  It has a beefier suspension and more HP.  Want even more
HP, buy the 951 (Yes the 951, the ultimate 944)! The money you spend
on upgrades can go towards the purchase of the next model  944.  Save
the upgrades and mods to the owners of the Porsche wannabes!  I
believe tires are the only legitimate upgrade for the 944!

My 944 is a daily car and as been great!  Granted, I'm still green as a
Porsche owner, but I feel the car was meant to be driven and not sitting
in a garage waiting for the weekends. Has anybody thought that maybe
thats why some owners always seem to have problems with their car is
because they don't drive them enough?  I don't know....maybe a year
from now I'll change my tune but I doubt it! 

I hope I didn't step on anybodys toes!, it wasn't my intention!  I wanted  to
share my thoughts on the beauty of ALL 944s.  Appreciate any
response --good or bad!
