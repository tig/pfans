One of the reasons I bought my 924 was the sound of the doors slamming shut.
I also love the really solid and rugged look these cars have. If you look at
the door edges and hood edges, you see that the steel bends inwards making
the whole thing look "thick", instead of normal cars' paper thin edges. The
interior also looks "fat". Show me one other car that had anything other
than super thin plastic interior in 1976!

I guess that didn't make any sense..
