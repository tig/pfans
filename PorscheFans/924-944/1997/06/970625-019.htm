>well, that is a tough choice. the easy part is forget the S2.
>best of luck - Doug

Careful, Doug. That's a bold statement. The 968 is basically an S2 w/ 25
more hp, a slightly more aerodynamic shape and a 6th gear that doesn't do
much except drop revs on the interstate.  And a good S2 can be had for $10K
cheaper. Which comes out to about $400/unit hp for a 968.  Figure in the
value factor.

Perhaps you'd like to find out what that 25 hp is worth on the track. I
could use a road trip. We'll strap on helmets and best of luck, Doug.

(Minor note: I also recommended a 968 to Chris if cost wasn't a factor, but
that was before my car was insulted.)
