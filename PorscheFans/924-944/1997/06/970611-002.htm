Don't panic.  You need to put the rear of the car up in the air and crawl
under and look at the top of the transaxle from the driver's side.

You will see a rubber boot that covers a black metal shaft (the tail end of
the shifter shaft).  Peel back that boot and inspect the 13 mm bolt that
has a steel wire running through the head. See if that is loose first.
That bolt threads through the shaft and there is a detent in the short
shaft that it attaches to.  There are a series of levers and short shafts
that translate the side to side motion of the shifter to engage 2nd to 3rd
and 4th to 5th transitions that go over the top of the transaxle.  Inspect
those as well.

I had the long main shifter shaft (from shift knob to transaxle) actually
snap in half on my first 944.  My shifter got funky then became
inoperative.  It was a clean break and remains a mystery to this day as to
why it broke.  I had to drop the transaxle to fix it which is not too big a
job (a Saturday should do it).  I doubt that yours has snapped, but most
likely your 13 mm bolt has worked loose enough to allow some play in the
shifter.  The steel wire is meant to keep that from happening, so replace
that wire and snug it tight with a pair of pliers.

Good luck with your repair,

Marv
