Not exactly, I compared with a Mecedes *just as old* as the 944. Even my
1965 220-S ran for 6 years without any repairs at all, not even minor (sold
last year). Just good maintenance like changing oil and tires etc...

It's just that I was accustomed to be free of serious misfortunes with my
previous cars I suppose.

Okay. But quality is just what you should expect from such an expensive
car, I mean even the early ones weren't exactly cheap. In 1984 you could
buy a new 300ZX T-bar for 50% less than a 944 targa and however this car
doesn't even come close in terms of handling and performance, or looks,
it's a good quality car. I have 2 collegues both driving a 85 300ZX without
any troubles like I see on the 924-944 list. Please don't shoot me for this
remark. I don't have any Nissan or Mercedes stock either :-)

True. But 944s do tend to be rattly cars and mine isnt even the worst in
that respect. Very common problems like failing headlight switches,
cracking dashes etc are not supposed to happen in a car with such a high
price tag. Also apparent design flaws like oil starvation (causing bearings
to blow out), failing radiator seals, leaking power steering hoses and bad
motor mounts
to name just a few, dissapoint me a bit. I am just pretty lucky I can now
prevent certain _very costly_ repairs by learning from other peoples
experiences by using the internet and a subscription to the P-fans list,
but what about those not in such a lucky position... A dealer doesn't give
you the 944 first time buyers FAQ you know, customers would run away pretty
fast if they did.

Well not in my case. I was also a wild driver in the Benz, believe me.

I was apparently less lucky than the average 944 buyer/owner/driver. See below.

Well, I sincerely hope I will be as confident about my 944 as you are one
day, but this will take some time I suppose. I had failing rod bearings,
costing me a full engine rebuild (including new crank), a new clutch,
belts, upgraded motor mounts and lots of other less major but annoying and
costly troubles in just 6 months time. The car is now free of problems for
about 4 months ans lets hope for my wallets sake it will stay okay for at
least a decent while. Otherwise I just might go and look for a 300 or 500
SL.

Haha. But what about the "Bop" from a Merc ! Just Kidding, I love the
P-Car. Thanks for your comments !
