Hello again.

Just got my radiator out of my 944na and attempted to flush it, but I am
having some problems.  What is happening is this- I can run water through
the radiator (right-side up, upside-down, whichever), until it flows clear
and freely, but after it sits for a while, green coolant will eek out
slowly.  It looks like there are little whitish-grey flakes/flecks of some
material in the dribbling coolant.  I figure that there is some internal
blockage in one or more of the passages, and even though there is free flow
through the unit, the blockage is trapping some old coolant inside,
allowing it to merely dribble out slowly.  I figure as well that the flakes
are the material that the blockage is composed of.  My questions are these:

1)  Does this sound like corroded aluminum (the flakes) or, heaven forbid,
radiator stop-leak material?  The outside of the radiator is painted black.
 My father asked me if this is the factory color, and in fact, I thought
the aluminum portion of the radiator was aluminum-colored from the factory.
 There is some whitish discoloration down the engine side of the radiator
in some areas.  Could this be evidence of a leak?

2)  Does anyone know the psi of the cooling system in case I want to have
the radiator pressure-tested for leaks?

3)  Any of you guys have any thoughts on the best way to go about removing
blockages from inside this delicate and unholy marriage of plastic and
aluminum? (hey - Just kidding about the unholy bit)

Thanks a million for all the info so far on cooling system R&R, I got
several helpful responses, and feel like I'm going to understand this part
of my car inside and out when it's all over.  Now if I can only find some
pavement to do my repairs on . . .
