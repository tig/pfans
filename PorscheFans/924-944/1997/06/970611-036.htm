Things to consider when doing oil cooler seals:

1. Pressure test oil cooler - it is a (very slight) risk that the oil
cooler is faulty - but better safe than sorry.

2. Degunk the cooling system completely with a water soluble degreasing
agent, and flush, flush and - flush. 

3. Consider changing the rubber tubes, especially if the condition has
been going on for some time. One of mine broke immediately (that is, two
weeks later and 100 miles from base...) and the other after 8 months.
Pay it now, or pay it later... 

4. Change oil and filter immediately afterwards. Ideally, the rod
bearings should also be changed but that is IMO overkill...

5. It is possible to misalign the cooler and housing assembly, 
(at least on 944's) and a slight risk for the oil pressure bypass valve
to jam - with oil pressure problems as a consequence.

Otherwise, it is not too tricky. You will probably be happier with the
front end fairly high on jack stands as some bolts are easier to get to
from below.  

Good luck !
