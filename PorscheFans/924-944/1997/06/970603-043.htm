Okay, okay, at the risk of being banned from the list I will throw my
personal suggestions.  They might be slightly unorthodox, but I feel they
are sound.

First, I use the 3 ton, 24" jack stands, the big ones (just finished my
clutch in the Turbo).

Second, I always use them in pairs on a level hard surface (i.e., concrete).

Third, I remove the belly pan before doing any serious lifting.  This
exposes the front aluminum cross member.  I place a wood block on the end
of my 3 ton hydraulic floor jack and lift from the center of that cross
member (careful with the engine oil pan).  I would not recommend lifting
using the oil pan, but I guess that if I use a large enough oak or plywood
panel I could distribute the force over a large enough area to do it.  I do
not see the sense when the aluminum cross member is right there.  I use
that.

This will get the front up in the air.  I lift it as far as the jack will
go and place the stands under the cross member (to do a clutch), or under
the frame rails well behind the A-arms.  I also duct tape cardboard on the
ends of my jack stands to prevent scratches and damage to the undercoating.

When I lower the car, I do it s-l-o-w-l-y.  What will damage those frame
rails is improper placement of the jack stands and dropping the car on the
stands.  I have never witnessed damage from jack stands under the frame
rails from just the weight of the car.

For the rear I use a soft pine board that sits in the cup of the jack and
place it under the transaxle.  I just lift it slowly and watch what I am
doing.  The transaxle is plenty strong for this and I have never had a
problem.  When I get to the cruising altitude I place the stands under the
rear aluminum swing arms as close to the pivot point as I can get.  Some
people use the two horizontal bars that extend out from the wheel well, but
that reduces the maximum lift height.

For me, I feel it is absolutely safe, if not better, to use four jack
stands to lift the entire car, but I make sure everything is solid and my
stands are not cocked!

I am a very cautious person when it comes to safety and I feel very
comfortable with this method and the car is very stable.

I never place jack stands on blocks or use other methods to gain altitude.
I get bigger stands if required.

I Jack my car in stages if I feel nervous.  I do not like putting blocks on
top of the jack to gain lift.  I will use wood to protect the car.  If my
jack is not tall enough, and I must get more height, I would construct a
wooden ramp to set the jack on using layers of 2 X 12 lumber so I have
plenty of solid support.  I use over rated jacks and stands to get the job
done.

I also do not like using the factory jack points with jack stands.  They
seem unstable and since there are only two it is not a good location for
stands.

WARNING!!!

The four corner do-hickies that look like jack points on the car are NOT
for jacking!!!  Those points are used for chassis alignment and have NO
structural strength as they are attached to only the floor sheet metal.
They will bend and then be useless for their intended job.  DO NOT USE THEM!

The only two jack points for the factory scissor jack is located in the
middle of the rocker panel, one on each side by the diamond at the middle
of the panel.  Automation (I think) sells an adapter for a hydraulic floor
jack to fit that hole, but I use soft pine.

Good luck with your lifting!

Post Script:

To remove my transaxle, I constructed a home brew transaxle adapter and I
would be glad to share my experiences and plans with anyone that has
Microsoft Word 6.0.1.  You will need Word as this has a lot of diagrams in
it.

Also, I can take no responsibility for any damage, harm, or injury caused
by any persons that choose to lift and support their cars in the manor I
have chosen.  These are my observations and methods I uses to work on my
car.  If you choose to do the same, you do so at your own risk.
