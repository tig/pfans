Hi

I just finished rebuilding my clutch in my 86' 951 and can now after about
2 weeks feel what appears to be the thrust bearing that I just replaced.  I
can usually only feel the roughness in the clutch after hard acceleration
in 1st and 2nd, the rough feeling will usually go away after awhile.  If
anyone has some advice or might of had a similar problem I'd appreciate any
and all comments (I don't feel like pulling the clutch apart again).  I
know I didn't forget to replace anything like the pilot bearing or anything
because I replaced everything when I did this job to eliminate anything
that might cause a failure soon after rebuild.

           			Thanks, Brent
	86' 951 (I can't believe the clutch feels like this!!!!!!)
