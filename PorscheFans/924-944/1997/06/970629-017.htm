I have not had the pleasure of disecting a 944 transaxle, as of yet.  
However, if you can still shift into gears, it isolates your problem to 
the differential where you've probably tossed your pinon or your spider 
gears.  Friends of mine have autocrossed with more mileage and have not 
had any problem.  

Without pulling the trans. and opening it up will you be able to tell 
what the cause of the failure was due to. Once you find out what 


happened, please let us all know.  It may be something we should watch 
more closely, especially if we "drive" our car & it has a few miles on 
it.

I think pulling a trans. in a 944 is much easier than other cars.  
You'll need 6T jackstands to get the rear end up as high as possible, a 
$55 trans. adapter for your floor jack and a 3/8 drive air ratchet w/a 
12 point torx type wrench for the half-shaft screws.

The job should take 4-5 hours from start to finish.

I do have a '86 NA transaxle w/ only 41K miles on it.  I could let it go 
for $600 + shipping.

If you are interested, please call @ (515) 255-3410, ask for John

Regards,

John Prunty
