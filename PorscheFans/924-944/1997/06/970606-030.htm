Ben asks:
>>Are the headlight squirters supposed to work by holding back on the
>>windshield wiper stalk with the headlights on (up)?  Or do they have a
>>different control?          If they don't work, does that mean there's
>>probably just a lot of crud in the nozzles and hoses?  And do they have
>>separate pumps from the one used for the regular windshield washers?
>>        Any info about these devices are welcome--everyone else I've talked

TO:  Ben and others concerned

I've never used them either, but according to my owners manual:
	"To operate the headlight washer, push the washer lever in the
direction of the dashboard (switch position 7).  The system only operates
when the headlights are on."
	"A separate pump supplies high-pressure water to the spray nozzles
located in front of the headlights on the bumper.  The high pressure stream
soaks the dirt on the lenses and washes it off.  Repeat the wash cycle as
necessary to remove heavy dirt accumulation."
	"Since the system uses a lot of water, a reservoir holding approx.
1.6 U.S. gals. or 6 liters has been installed in the engine compartment.
This reservoir also supplies the windshield washer with water.  Use
windshield washer solvent with anti-freeze all year round, so that both
washer systems also function at freezing temperatures."
	"DO NOT USE ENGINE COOLANT ANTI-FREEZE OR ANY OTHER SOLUTION THAT
MAY DAMAGE THE CAR PAINT"

Now, everyone should save this to their hard drives.  Eventually, we'll
probably have a complete set of owners manuals on the "net".

While I have my manual at my desk, does anyone else have any questions??
