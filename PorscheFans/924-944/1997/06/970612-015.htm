	My 86 951 Kalahari Metallic (sport suspension, 
rear wiper, Alpine CD Changer, cruise, part 
leather seating, rear defrost) has 122k miles.
2nd owner (purchased Jan), CA car, paid $7500
for, $2k down, no warranty, 4 years at 12%.  Needs tires,
LF ball joint, just put new pads on, and I'd like
to repaint the nose 'cause my little sister's bike
fell on it when I tripped over it while detailing
the car in the garage.  At least it did not
dent the hood (whew).  I though about selling it
as I was let go, fired, laid off, terminated (non-Arnold)
right after I put money down on her, but she is 
too pretty.
	If the girls in the movie, Gumball Rally, had
been driving this car instead of the super modified
white VW Targa, the Cobra and Ferrari would not have had
a chance.  Oh ok, maybe the Ferrari.


Dana - My car has FTL, Faster Than Legal, drive. (:


My new Corvette is in the shop because I hit a bump
and the rear suspension fell off and when the tail hit the
ground the frame broke in half, and that is why I cannot
give you a ride in it today.
