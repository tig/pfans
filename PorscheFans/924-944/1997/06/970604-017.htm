<< I was getting some work done on my car today so I had them change the gear
 oil. They used GM gear oil with a special GM additive for GM positrac rear
 ends. I can't believe what a difference this made. Cold shifts are better
 than it used to be fully warmed up. Once it's warm it's really slick. They
 told me several other 944's and 911's are running this oil and additive for
 autocrossing. It helps when shifting from 2nd to 1st.

Does anyone else have any information on this product?  I need to replace the
gear oil in my car but I don't want to do anything that may hurt it.  The
smoother shifting between 1st and 2nd would be a real plus too!  Do you know
specifically the names of the oil and the additive?
