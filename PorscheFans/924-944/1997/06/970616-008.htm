It can be almost impossible sometimes not to react to a challenge, but I
think Porsche drivers have got to be role models, particularly if we've
done a little drivers ed.  And I've heard that 944 people have a worse
reputation for aggression than 911 drivers.  A while back I got challenged
by a bunch of kids trying to pass me in a Ford Explorer (for Christ sake)
on a 2-lane highway.  I was dumb enough to react. Didn't outrun them. Just
held them out in the opposing traffic lane long enough to scare them into
braking. My message was "Don't be stupid", but I'm the one who was in
control of the situation, I was the one being stupid, and it scares me to
think of what the consequences might have been.  Best to save aggression
for the track.
