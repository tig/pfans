Thanks for your reply.  I really don't think heat has anything to do with
my problem.  The car always starts with the driver's side door is open and
does not start when it is closed (or when you push the door jam button that
is pushed when you close the door).  

You may be right about the switch problem.  How do I test the starter
switch?  I have tested to ensure that the solenoid gets power when the door
is open and does not get power when the door is closed.  I guess the switch
could have some internal problem that causes it to cut current when the
door switch is pushed.  I don't know.  

I have checked all the contacts and cables, and they are all good, secure
and do not have any corrosion.  

I would really appreciate you checking to see if this problem may be
associated with a relay.  Thanks for your help!

One other question:  If I change the ignition switch, is there any way I
can keep the same key?  I really do not want more than one key for my car
(one for the ignition and one for the doors).
