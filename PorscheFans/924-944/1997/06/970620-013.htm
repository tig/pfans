One thing you may want to check is the cabling from the alternator and Starter
motor. This passes very close to the exhaust manifold and can cause the cabling
to melt and fuse. It happened to me, Starter motor engaged as I was driving, 
ended up replacing the starter motor (which melted internally) and the
alternator, Together with a large section of wire. The cables are now protected
with some Heat Shroud I got of a plumber, used to insulate boiler pipes.

This only happens on 924's , the 924T (931) has a different engine
configuration.

Good luck with your new purchase!
