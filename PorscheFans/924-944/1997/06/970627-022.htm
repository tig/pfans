 them again]

Howdy,

I had a problem with my car last night.  The reason why I'm posting this
is because someone else had a similar problem, almost exactly that they
were not able to solve, so hopefully this will help them.

I had just completed one of my all out runs down a back road.  When I
finally got off the throttle at 100mph and got back on it, the car
started to fart and the revs actually started to drop.  The more throttle,
the more it dropped.  The car was backfiring, making all sorts of noise,
but would not go under load.  I had to literally coast at 5% throttle
back home (I was pretty close to home).

While in my garage, I started to rev the motor, it would buck, fart,
puke black smoke and then occasionally blow huge flames out of the
exhaust (past the cat!?).  I knew then that it wasn't a fuel problem,
but likely an ignition problem, so I pulled out the coil.  It looked
connected fine, I undid the connection and put it back on.  The car
fired up right away and the problem was completeley cleared.  I know
that it wasn't just turning it off/turning it on that cured it because
I had done that before and it didn't fix it.  Only pulling the wire off
the coil and putting it back on solved it.  Why would this have fixed
it?  Is it co-incidence?  Did I whack something else that may have
fixed it?  To the person that had the same problem, try it.  There is
one nut that you undo and the clamp comes undone and you can pull the
black plastic thing off.  Undo the single wire and then put it on
again.  The only other things I checked were the cap and rotor were on
tight and the ignition wires were on tight.

The car ran flawlessly this morning.  Has this happened to anyone else
before?
