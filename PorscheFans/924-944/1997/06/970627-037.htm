DANGER-DANGER-DANGER   WARNING-WARNING-WARNING

Speaking from PERSONAL experience, you have to be VERY careful about
holding the hood up as far as it will go, because it might just go up
farther than you want it to, and could crack the windshield, as mine did
last fall.  My insurance company just paid $900 for a new one for me 6
weeks ago.  I cracked the windshield using the method above on the
passenger side, only I didn't have a helper.  I did the driver side by
attaching the hood portion first and then compressing the strut against the
inside top of the fender - no windshield damage.  I found it much easier to
attach the strut to the ball connection under the pressure of the strut
expanding than trying to line up the pin with the holes in the strut and
hood.  That's my experience with the problem.
Now you have a difficult choice to make.

Good Luck
