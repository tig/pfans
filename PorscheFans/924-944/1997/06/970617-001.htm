Hi Wes,

Thanks :-)
A touring pass is a Porsche insurance. When your are on a trip (car-trip =
:-)
and your car is involved into an accident or has another damage, so that =
you
cannot drive it furthermore, they pay the towing of the car to the next
Porsche repair centre, pay hotel costs, etc. Hope i never have to make
use of it but it's part of the Porsche service here in germany.

I looked rather long for a 944 S2. Finally i called "Porsche Online". The=
y
have a database with all used Porsches that are for sale by all german
Porsche Centres. They sent some faxes to me and then i picked my S2.
(The last fax offer i got only contained 5(!) 944 S2 which are for sale
by Porsche in germany)

The S2 has no very special options. (I *never* saw an advertisment of a S=
2
with M030 and/or LSD). It's just a plain 2/91 944 S2 with the 968-like re=
ar
wing and design 90 wheels. It also has no a/c - but i don't need this her=
e
in germany (and save some weight...)

I paid 31.000 DM which is about 17.700 US$ (1.00 US$ ~~ 1.75 DM)
