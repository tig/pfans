IMHO the best tires on the market today are Bridgestone S0-2s. You WILL
notice the difference. Excellent in the wet, I just drove to work in
pouring rain with standing water on the road. Absolutely no sign of
aquaplaning. My car is a 951s with 225 & 245. You will have to be doing
something very illegal or stupid ( believe me I done both ) to achieve
anything other than more grip and a tightening line in the dry. I have
put ~7000 miles on mine since March with no adverse wear problems. I see
no reason why these tires wont last 25-30K miles. Very cool tread
pattern too.

I have Goodyear ZRs (gatorbacks) on the front of my 951S and Goodear
GSCs on the back. I have to replace the rears and discovered Goodyear
doesn't make GSCs in 245/45 16s any more. The GSCs balanced the
gatorbacks very nicely (with gatorbacks on the rear the car tended to
oversteer too much) but now I'm at a loss as to what tires to buy for
the rear. Goodyear has come out with a tire called F! that they say
should work nicely. Has anyone tried the Goodyear F1s and , if so, what
did you think of them?
