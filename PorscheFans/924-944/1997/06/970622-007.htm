Terry,

You have one of two things happening.   Either your front shocks
are bad, or your tires are STILL unbalanced.    The high performance
shocks on a Porsche rarely fail completely, but rather begin to fail
to control motion within their normal operating range.    Even the
service manuals tend to be a bit vague about when to change them,
advising to swap them whenever you THINK they might be bad.  
With regard to balancing, high aspect ratio tires can be difficult to
balance.    I would expect your tire shop will rebalance them for
you if there continues to be a problem, so you might suggest to them
that  they put the weights on the centerline of the tire rather than
the edges of the rims.   If you want to isolate a balancing problem,
you can swap the fronts with the rears.   If the problem changes
or goes away, at least you know what it is.   If nothing changes, you
know what it isn't.

Good luck.

Dave
