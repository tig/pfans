From the old Porschephiles list I copy the following that somebody wrote about
this.  I wish I knew who it was so I could give them proper credit.

<begin quote>
Look on the driver-side floor boards (I hope you haven't vacuumed
recently). You should find two small pieces of white plastic and a small
brass spring. If so, that's why you get hot air. When not broken in half,
this plastic clip connects with a rod (you can see it under the dash) and
operates. . . YES! You guessed it. . .

The plastic clip breaking is quite common for 944s, and an authorized
dealer mechanic (good one) should be able to diagnose this over the phone
(holding on the phone while you inspect the floor boards). My kid did it
this way. Of course, he's a genius. I had him bring over a new clip and
install it in one minute (I'm not a genius). If you can't find the remnants
of the clip, make sure anyway. Check to see if the rod is clip-less.

The plastic clip is a 15 cent part (or, so). Sorry to read about all the
other parts you changed.
