In a message dated 97-06-18 03:22:31 EDT, you write:

<< My 924 vibrates below 1000RPM, very much so when the fan kicks in. I
thought
 this was due to shot engine mounts, but I have been told that I would
 *really* know it if one or both of the engine mounts failed. He said a
 failed mount would be more of a pain than a slight vibration. >>

The amount of vibration may just be a function of how collapsed the mounts
may be.  Also, realize that a "mild" vibration to one person may be
"terrible" to someone else.  I have the telltale vibration at idle RPM and I
know my mounts are collapsed because I had my shop check them and confirm the
diagnosis.  The amount of vibration does increase when the fan kicks on.
 Check your manual as there are measurements you can make to see if the
mounts are indeed collapsed.
