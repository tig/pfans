	I spun the No. 2 rod bearing on my stock motor two years ago and happened
across a deal on a brand new motor that would be cheaper than rebuilding my
stock motor.

	The motor I have is Block No. 007 and it came from the old Holbert Race
Shop.  It has no balance shafts, a 928 cylinder head and the cam carrier
has a removable plate on the injector side for checking the clearance on
the lifters.  The cam carrier also has some illegible notes written on it
in German.  I haven't the slightest idea what is actually written on the
cam carrier.

	The balance shaft oil passages were sealed off and I the shaft covers
installed.  I made two covers for the ends near the cam belt.  My motor
runs smooth and does not jump around as one would expect at idle.  The does
have a slight buzz at high RPMs; however, I would not call it anything
serious.

	The 928 cylinder head is a nice touch, as the larger valves helps with the
air flow.  The only problem I had with the head was routing the water back
to the radiator, since the 928 head has a water outlet on the lower front
on the cylinder head, and not on top like the 944 head.  The 007 Block has
the water outlet welded shut to seal the coolant in the engine.  I tapped
the side of the block to bring hot water from the fabricated pipe to the
thermostat.

	The cam carrier has a removable plate that runs the length of the injector
side.  The motor was designed to use carbs and mechanical lifters.

	Other changes I have made include: lightened flywheel; PowerBox, fuel
pressure regulator; header and cat-bypass pipe with 944 Turbo muffler; 293
degree cam; cone air filter; and a vented nose panel.

	I have not put the car on a dyno, but the car can easily keep up with a
944 Turbo on Summit Point's main straight.  I did some weight/elapsed time
runs trying to ball-park the horsepower...approx. 215.  I have a friend
with a GT4R PCA racer with a similar engine configurations.  He has Webers
and approx. 300 horses.  Lucky guy.

	***I'm curious if the Air Flow Meter off the S2 or 928 would work on my
motor.  Does anyone know if either of these would be compatible.  I'm
looking for more air flow.  I'm having a larger throttle body made by
Intersport in Vienna, VA right now.

	***Has anyone had any experience with the Electromotive distibutorless
ignition systems.  I have never been real pleased with the
rotor/distributor set up on the 944.

	I hope you find my motor interesting.
