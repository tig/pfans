P-Fans,

Did my brake pads for the first time (yeah, I know, it's about time) and
have a few questions about the 4 piston brakes. I've got the Porsche
manual, but not the Turbo sections, which cover these brakes. And Haynes
just says don't mess w/ 4 piston calipers.  

Think I got the pads in without undue pressure on disk, pistons, and
sprayed liberal amounts of brake cleaner. I used Jim Pasha's recommendation
of several 60-0 mph hard braking routines, and the brakes seemed OK. On the
interstate (not much traffic), I braked hard from 80-30 mph w/ no pulling
to one side or chattering.  However, at lower speeds of 40-0 mph, there's a
chatter (more like clunking) in the right front brake as the car slows to
almost a stop.  I think something like this may also have been occuring
earlier on the track in tight, low-speed corners before the pad
replacement, but not sure.

My question is what might be the cause.  My initial thought was that the
ABS might not function effectively at very low speeds under very heavy
braking, causing the brakes to grab, and you're simply not supposed to do
this w/ABS. Might also have an ABS wheel speed sensor that isn't
functioning properly at the right front corner. Any
opinions/interpretations?

Second question. I've never bled brakes before either. The 4 piston
calipers have 2 nipples, inside and out. I assume both sides should be
bled, but is there a sequence that should be followed?

TIA.
