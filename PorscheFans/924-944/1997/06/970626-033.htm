Come on now, there's no reason to put down the S2. It's a terrific car--a
Porsche, after all--and certainly stands up on its own merits.

Richard has a point, though. In terms of ultimate performance and
bang-for-the-buck, you can't beat a 951. The 'S' models (1988.5 and all
1989) make the best platform for an all-out performance car. In your
comparison of 944S2 and late 951S vehicles, don't forget the following
standard features of the latter:

  - M030 package w/djustable Konis, threaded strut bodies
  - 928S4 front brakes
  - hardened first and second gears
  - transaxle oil cooler
  - forged (not cast) 7.5" and 9" wheels
  - stiffer bushings all around
  - larger sway bars

....not to mention the extra power. And, I can have 300bhp in my 951S for
the cost of a set of computer chips--around $400. Try that with your S2.

On the other hand, the S2 is probably a better car for driving around town
because of its low-end torque. Plus, maintenance costs and reliability are
almost certainly better than with a 951.

It all comes down to a matter of taste, your budget, and how you intend to
use the car. When I bought my first 951S I also considered 87-89 Carreras,
and 968 coupes. When that car was totaled in a traffic accident, I had the
chance to change my mind and buy a different car; I bought another 951S. To
me the choice is obvious, but every person has his own preferences.
