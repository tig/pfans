PFans,

Thought you might be interested in an assessment of the 6 cylinder Z3, even
tho it's heresy to post Bimmer stuff here. Had quick test drives in two of
these (the Bimmer folks like to show them off, even to people they know
aren't going to buy one).  Really quick, nice handling, and the rear end
steps out smoothly in a tight turn. The pedals are placed beautifully for
heel/toe. And of course the transmission is smooth, like all Bimmers.  I
was surprised that the Boxster might  have some decent competition.  Would
love to try the M3 version when it arrives; must be a very fast car. So
don't be a marque snob if you get a chance to go for a spin. Have no idea
how the Z3 would handle at the limit on the track, but it's more tossable
than reviews would lead you to believe.
