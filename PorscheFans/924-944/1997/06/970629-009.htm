I finally got the balance-shaft problem fixed...shafts were out of sync,
now I got the car back and my speedometer's odometer and trip meter
don't work, but the speedometer DOES work.  I have read that the 924's
odometer/tripmeter is ran on plastic gear cogs, and not to reset the
tripmeter while the car is moving, or you can strip the teeth off the
gears.  Does this hold true for the 944 as well, or did the age and
milage just take it's toll on the gearing system? BTW, the car is a 1984
944, with 95,500 miles on it...well maintained. Would there be any
connections (electrical or mechanical) that my mechanic might have
accidently or otherwise disconnected under the car while fixeing the
timing/balance-shaft belts? If I have to replace or rebuild this
speedometer, does anyone know how much it might run me...$$$?  The
Haynes manual doesn't cover this, and says not to try it yourself, and
all my catalogs don't list a 180 MPH 944 speedometer for sale. If I
don't fix it, I won't be able to log the milage for maintainance
schedules.  Any Ideas?

Thanks in Advance,

PS..Car runs great now, and speedometer seems accurate.
