....LONG...
This message is for all those who wrote to me about ideas for nice 2-3 
day driving trips starting from the Washington, Virginia, Maryland area.  
Most recently my girlfriend and I decided to dissappear for a weekend.  
Knowing how much I love to drive but fearing high speed vaults on public 
roads, Alex thought up a brilliant solution; Skyline Drive and the Blue 
Ridge Parkway.  Both provide the thrill of challenging driving and both 
are simply too complicated to admit much speeding.  I know, I know, 
isn't she brilliant?

>From Washington DC, we took 66 W to leave the city.  This ultimately 
intercepts Skyline Drive at its beginning in Front Royal, VA.  Entrance 
is $10.00.  We travelled the entire Drive ending around the intersection 
with 64 (west of Charlottesville).  From here, we continued south on the 
Blue Ridge Parkway to the intersection with teeny Route 56 East.  
Montebello is a "town" within about 20 minutes drive of the Parkway off 
56 East.  Talk about one-horse; as far as I could tell, towns are places 
with a BP station.  Anyway, the Bed & Breakfast there is called Dutch 
Haus Geselligkeit, owned and operated by Barbara and Elmer Blommer.

Friends, I have vacationed all over creation but nowhere have I enjoyed 
my stay as I did with the Blommer's (you actually stay IN their house).  
Barbara is a gourmet and breakfast, typically 3-4 courses, is a treat.  
I'm warning you now, don't eat anything for at least 4 days prior to 
your arrival.  All this, by the way, for fifty-some dollars a night.  
Literally a bargain at twice the price.

Sorry for the bandwidth for those out of range.  I had more people 
interested than I predicted and thought it best to post here.
