Jay, you read your email too late :)  I'm over the air-cooled blues.
All it took was one close examination of the dashboard.  I kept telling
Paul to turn the cigarette lighter off and he finally got mad and said
it was the damn rear window defogger that was pushed in, not the cig
lighter.  That's when I realized that I like my water cooled car :)

It's easier said than done.  Even individual people do some things to
entertain others.  It's hard when you see all the NA cars doing so well
in auto-x and you do so crappy in a turbo car, especially when you stick
the guys going fast in their cars into your and they go 3-4 seconds slower.
But, with some good advice from Barry, Doug, Jason and a few others, I
am gonna take a BIG kick at the can next year.  I'm hoping that a higher
average speed through the course will allow me to stay on boost more.

Farzaan.
