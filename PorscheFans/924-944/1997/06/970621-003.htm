Ref - by Eric Kessel. ekessel@ix.netcom.com - Tachometer weirdness

I have been researching this unit as I have been trying to get internal =
tacho lights to work - specifically the lights that are supplied with an =
automatic to indicate the gear selected.

The tacho circuit includes an IC and is supplied as a complete unit by =
VDO in Germany. (Tel 49 61 96 870)  If you want to speak to them you =
want to get to the "Original Equipment" division.

There are a number of block connectors to the instrument cluster,
So it would be worth re-seating all of these.  Ideally, also removing =
the fascia and re-seating the connector to the tacho itself.  Don't =
forget you also have the sender unit.  I am sure there are better brains =
than mine out there but hopefully it is an earth or connection problem.  =
As a matter of interest I have been quoted about $560 here in the UK - I =
would be interested to hear what price is in US. =20
