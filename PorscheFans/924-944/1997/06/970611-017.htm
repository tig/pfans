Good question ... I have a '91 944 cab.

I've observed that the aerodynamics of the car with the top down are 
pretty good.  If I don't have the boot on, I don't notice much movement 
(flapping) of the fabric as I drive.

My big concern really is the headliner.  If I'm just going to drive a
little around town, I don't bother with the boot -- however I don't leave
it parked without the boot for fear that some bird will crap on the
headliner.  I recently noticed on my car that one of the headliner pins
broke free (fabric is OK, plastic pin just won't hold).  I don't know what
might have caused that, but driving without the boot is a possibility. 

For highway speed trips greater than 10 miles or so, I'd definitely use
the boot.
