	Jason,

	Yes, it does. the procedure is covered in your owner's manual.
	Be sure and get one if you don't have one. Briefly, place the the
	key in the ignition and turn it to what would be the "accessory"
	setting on an American car (about halfway towards start). Press
	the open switch on your sunroof and you'll hear the gears turning
	for a couple of second. You've now unlocked the rear part of the
	sunroof. Now pull down on each of the front latches just above
	and forward of you head. Once you've done both of those,
	*carefully* push up on the roof. The whole thing should lift up
	and you can get out and grab it and store it in that bag. Be 
	careful not to drop it :) Good luck!

	P.S. My address has changed everyone. I'm no longer at
	UNT so this address will be my permanent one.
