Heading towards the vintage racing circuit so I am considering selling my 944
Turbo S. 

This car has 89,000 miles and I am the second owner. The first owner drove it
mostly on the highway and I bought it with 70,000 miles. It had all service
records and was serviced by a local dealer.
It is black with a burgundy interior, complete with non cracked dash!
I have used it for commuting and play. It has done track events and has been
Club Raced. Comes with all safety equipment as well as log book. Weight is
3020lbs with 1/4 tank of fuel which is the "E" stock minimum. 
Safety and race equipment includes the following:
Two OMP MontoCarlo racing seats. These are very comfortable and recline.
Two sets of TeamTech quick release harnesses.
Autopower bolted in roll bar 
Battery disconnect switch
Window net (window can be rolled up with net in place)
European replica fiberglass rear bumper (saves 50 lbs)
30mm Turbo Cup front anti sway bar
22mm Weltmeister adjustable rear anti sway bar
Cool Brakes
Very trick Carbon Fiber camber truss
K & N Filter
8.5 x 17 and 10 x 17,  3 piece HRE wheels (BBS look alike)
255 x 17 an 275 x 17 R1's (about 1/2 used)
New front rotors (never tracked)
Performance Friction pads all around (Used 1 day on other rotors)
Autothority 2.7 chip set (only used on street for last 2 months)
Borla exhaust system with Cat by pass.
Fresh front control arms (car has not been lowered)
Car comes with ALL original equipment including, power seats, bumper, chip
set, exhaust, wheels, etc.
Car has always finished in the top 1/3 of its class in Club Racing class E
stock with consistently terrified driver.
Have always driven to and from track events and Club Racing. Only trailer
ride was to Sebring.
Recent maintenance has been:
Club Sport Clutch assembly
New motor mounts
New rod bearings (old ones were fine) Mobil 1 does that for you.
New control arms
Belts and water pump
New WindShield (no pitting at all)
Car needs nothing, buy it and take it to the track on the weekend. Even AC is
freezing cold.
Cosmetically it has a few minor dings and the usual paint chips from track
work. Original paint. Interior perfect.
I am located close to Philadelphia PA
The car is a priced at $16000. This is a realistic, no quibble price based on
excellent condition and all the race goodies. 
If interested or you want further info please E Mail me and I will supply my
phone number.
Note- I am not interested in selling individual parts.
Thanks for any interest.
Regards,
Jerry
