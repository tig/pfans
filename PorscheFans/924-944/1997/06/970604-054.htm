TO: Porsche Peers
FR: Rick (87 924S)

Oops, got spastic and hit send before I was ready.  Anyway....I was
ranting that these mechanics want over $800 just to replace my belts and
water pump!  One mechanic from Byers Imports in Columbus quoted me
$3800.00!!!! to just do the above mentioned plus replace my brake pads,
turn the rotors, replace my motor mounts, flush my radiator, lube the
tranny and transaxle, replace the oil cooler seal, and change out the
oil with new filter (figured I'd treat myself on the oil change one time
instead of doing it myself while I was at it).  Byers Imports is a
porsche dealer by the way.

Obviously, I've decided to do all the easy stuff myself! Duh!  But I
don't have the technical skill to do the belts, nor the tools to do the
water pump and motor mounts.  So much for giving my agenda some slack...

If there is a Porsche Fans member that lives in my general vicinity,
including the bordering states, that has the name, address, and phone
number of a mechanic that's not a banker on the side, please let me
know.

As always, thanks for any help in advance.  Rick
