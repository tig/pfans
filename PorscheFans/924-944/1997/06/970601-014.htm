H E L P !

     At one point yesterday my temperature gauge read above the upper mark
(it has never done that), after 15-20 min.of easy driving.  The next time I
started the car, the tachometer did not respond (rested at zero), until I
goosed the throttle.  This morning, as I was heading out of town, I noticed
the temperature was riding at the upper mark.  I pulled into a gas station
(I needed gas).  After about 5-7 min., I pulled out of the station, and the
temp needle climbed from half-guage to just above the upper mark AS I
ACCELERATED OUT OF THE STATION TO 55 MPH (just a few seconds).  This was no
lethal acceleration, mind you - just everyday driving.  The temp came down
a little as I rode down the highway, then climbed up again when I hit the
first bridge.  This was enough to cancel my trip and return home.  In the
driveway, I raised the hood and felt the hoses.  They were soft and gummy
on the undersides.  Some goo(rubber) residue stuck to my hands.  I could
squeese the hoses quite easily with the car running.  I also noticed as I
arrived at the house and rolled up the powere windows, that whenever I
depressed the window button the temp needle fluttered.  Closer inspection
revealed ALL the needles fluttering, but not to the extent of the temp.
     
     I have owned this car for four months now, and it has always run
hotter than I would be comfortable with (I learned to drive in a series of
brit sportscars), always registering between the two marks, but usually
mid-range and up, even on cold overcast days, such as today.  I had to have
a thermoswitch installed when I bought the car because the fans ran
constantly (not sure about the temp rating of the switch) so I know that
the switch is new and the fans are operational.  The PO had a new waterpump
and belts installed 16,000 miles ago (2.5yrs).  The PO didn't strike me as
being a porsche genius(worse than I am probably), so I figured at some
point he replaced the coolant and got air trapped inside the system, not
knowing to bleed it.  On the other hand, maybe he used the wrong kind of
coolant.  In any event, the rising temperature didn't seem problematic
until now.  I assume the hoses where collapsing under suction or something
similar (something like that happened to my father's mustang in 64 - quite
a comparison, huh?), causing a stoppage of flow during an increase in RPM.

     At this point I am assuming that the hoses are disintegrating and have
gunked up the radiator, and/or other parts of the system.  To be safe, I am
also assuming that there is air in the system, and it is filled with the
incorrect coolant and has developed corrosion in the water passages and the
radiator.  I am planning to at least replace the coolant and back-flush the
system, replacing the hoses and thermostat as well.  Hence my questions:

1)   My coolant is clear and green and looks good, but I doubt if the
system has ever been flushed.  How is this done?  -particularly with the
notion that there is probably nasty stuff in the block as well as the
radiator.  I heard about a de-scaler?  Is this safe for the aluminum, or
even necessary?  Will it help at all?
   
2)   I would love to eliminate the waterpump from the equation.  Is this a
smart move?  Can I rely on 16,000 m. being new enough to eliminate the pump
as part of the problem?  I don't see any leakage from the pump (as far as I
can tell, although I do have a tiny drop under the radiator area from timr
to time- it hasn't gotten worse, so I figure maybe the thermoswitch seal is
at fault?).  I would sure like to avoid that replacement job.  

3)   What exactly is a flow-test?

4)   Could the needle flutter be a body-ground problem (and therefore
unrelated)?

     I am certainly not trying to avoid fixing faulty componentry on my car
to keep money in my pocket.  I have just graduated from college and I am
STRAPPED, so I am trying to repair this thing mentally first, before I
spend any UNNECESSARY (and scarce) dollars.  I also am going to have to
replace the motor mounts and the front crank oil seal (is that term
correct?) soon, so I need to be wasting as little money on this as
possible.  Any wisdom from any of you will save me expense and frustration.

Oh yes- while I have your ears(eyes)-
     I have an annoying clunk from the right front suspension/wheel area
that occurs if I brake hard while turning, or turn sharply while braking
(as in parking situations).  It is also evident when going over bumps in
the pavement (RR crossings, etc.)  I know that the rear shocks are worn out
(boy, I'm not kidding either - how bout some info on bilsteins vs. tokicos
while we're at it), and the front are suspect, but the car tracks straight,
doesn't make any other strange steering noises, etc.  
    Any ideas on this one?  I tried crawling up under the car and wiggling
things- yeah right, -but couldn't make out anything abnormal.
 
    This list has been a great asset to my crash-course on porsche
thinking.  I am hoping it can be equally effective in affordable porsche
repairing in this situation.

Thanks in advance,
Keith
