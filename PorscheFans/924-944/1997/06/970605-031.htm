No matter how good you are with the brakes, you can't beat
the computer. Here's why:

Motorcycles have two brake levers, one for the front brake, and
another for the rear brake. Why? Well because different conditions
require different brake pressure for front vs rear. 

Cars have 4 brakes, but only 1 pedal. You can't control one brake
indepandantly, but the computer can. Without ABS, when *1* brake
starts to lock up, you have to release ALL brakes to keep the
car in control. With ABS, when 1 brake starts to lock, the computer
releases braking *for that brake only*.

For the track that means you can trail brake an ABS car much more
than a non ABS car. You can start braking later, and continue the
braking deeper into a corner than a non ABS car. On the track,
especially when racing, that's a big advantage. If you are braking,
and start to turn on, as the inside rear wheel gets light and
starts to lock, the computer releases pressure on that wheel,
but the heavily loaded front wheels can do a lot more braking,
and ABS allows you to take advantage of it.

For some empirical evidence, Porsche puts ABS on the real race
cars, the 911 GT1 has it, so does the GT 2. If ABS wasn't an
advantage, it wouldn't be on the race car. It's that simple.
