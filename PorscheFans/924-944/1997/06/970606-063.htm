I am located in Fort Mill, SC just 5 minutes out of Charlotte, I have a
1987 944
it is RED !  a very beautiful car. It is in excellent shape with black
leather interior, new Michellin tires with less than 500 miles on them,
they were put on May 3, 1997  new timing belt, oil and filter change all at
this time, The timing belt was replaced because of its age. I have all
records. This car won 1st place in the PCA concours (show events) on May
11-12, 1997  This show was sponsered by Hendrick Porsche. The interior is
flawless along with the exterior, it has always been garaged.  We are
asking 10,000.  If you are interested please give us a call at 803-547-1914
