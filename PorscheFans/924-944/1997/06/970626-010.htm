Hi Everyone,

One thing to remember about the D40s that are on so many 944 cars: the D40s come 
from the factory with a red dot painted on their sides that denotes the "high spot" 
in that particular tire.

When mounting the tire on the wheel, remember to mount it with the red dot exactly 
opposite of the valve stem. I'd generalize and say 99.9% of tire shops don't know 
this, or don't bother to do it anyway. There's no way a tire company would go 
through the expense of finding the high spot and marking it if that info was 
worthless.

I guess on the 944 suspension, everything must be done just right to have a 
shimmyless car. Hope this helps!

Chris
87 944S

BTW-The Tire Rack told me about the red dot when I bought a set from them a few 
months ago (85 each).
