<< Jay, you read your email too late :)  I'm over the air-cooled blues.
 All it took was one close examination of the dashboard.  I kept telling
 Paul to turn the cigarette lighter off and he finally got mad and said
 it was the damn rear window defogger that was pushed in, not the cig
 lighter.  That's when I realized that I like my water cooled car :) >>

Glad to hear it, Farzaan.  Just to let you know, my future (?) son-in-law
just bought a '90 C4 and, of course, I HAD to take it out for a test drive.
 I'm basically just a street driver and I don't often push my car very hard
(although I used to do a lot of auto-xing in my younger days).  Anyway, the
C4 is a nice car but I still like me 944.  Yes, the C4 was NEWER but it was
not much BETTER!  There is no way I could justify the money difference and I
still think the body style and overall feel of my 944 is better.

For what it's worth!
