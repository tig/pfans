The Haynes manual has a pretty good section re: the fan motor, etc.  The 
cover is glued down with adhesive.  You need to cut the adhesive with a 
utility knife as you lift it up.

Undoubtedly a clogged drain is causing water to flow where it is not 
supposed to, most likely through some electrics, causing a short and 
blowing a fuse, then down your leg.  ;-)

You will want to check your fuse panel for wetness, as well as the 
connections around the blower motor.
