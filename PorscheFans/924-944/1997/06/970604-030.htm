the sales of the 968 were awful! the reasons are things no one can ever be
sure of, but here are the ones i usually hear (and belive).

although I like the look, most people did not like the headlights.
the price started going up, and getting very close to the 911 (example, a
nicely equiped 968 convertable would sticker around $60,000)
It was just a 4 cyl (although more torque and power than the boxster 6, a lot
of people dont like 4's).
too similar to the 924/944. People did not belive it was a new model, and
that line had been around a long time
