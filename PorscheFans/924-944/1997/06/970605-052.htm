The benefit of clever (and expensive) devices such as variocams,
variable length intakes and 4 (or even 5) valves per cylinder is not as
pronounced on turbocharged engines. The turbocharger will usually be
able to rise the pressure to sufficient levels to make the question of
intake resistance a minor problem, and therefore dual intake valves will
not really be neccessary. The engine itself acts like a effecient pump,
and the exhaust is pumped out of the engine. This is the only point
where a turbo will have any benefit of larger valve area. Usually,
intake area is choosen before exhaust area on NA engines due to the
pumping action. Remember, pressure can be rised to many times the
athmospheric pressure, but vacuum is a liting factor for
low pressure values.

Variocams will be useful on a turbo, but a varioram will not. The
variorams benefit is that it will let the inertia of the inlet gas help
to sustain a flow at a wider RPM range. Usually, there is only a small
RPM range that a inlet path can be tuned for, and basically, at WOT, it
should be as short and wide as possible. On lower RPMs (and less
throttle opening and/or gas speed), it is better with a longer path.

But it is probably easier and cheaper to utilize a 16 valve head on a
968 engine, and add turbo on that, then trying to use a old 8 V head.

To lessen compression, the piston tops may be machined if there is
sufficient material, wich I doubt. A somewhat shorter conrod can be used
too, but may be hard to get. You will have to find a solution to this,
as there is no way you can build a reliable turbo engine with the 10.6
base compression level...                          

But keep us posted - hot rodding is fun!
