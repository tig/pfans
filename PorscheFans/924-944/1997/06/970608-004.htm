Shocked by the price of exhausts for the 951,Tri-Flo, Borla or Porsche
OE , I was considering 3 inch SS from the turbo to the back silenced by
a supertrapp and a 3 inch unsilenced dump pipe from the wastegate.
Comment please.

A great sound can be had by installing a Flowmaster muffler to the rear
in place of the rear muffler.  There are different combinations that can
be installed.  An easy one is to use the two chamber (three is also
available) with 2 1/2" OD. center in and out pipes.  If you cut the rear
muffler off, the flowmaster will clamp right onto the pipe.  You will
have to fabricate a rear hanger  (which is pretty simple) and install a
rear exit tailpipe that will clamp on (you can get fancy here if you
wish...3" SS, or others).  This is the best sounding exhaust I have
heard on a street 944.  Flowmasters cost me in the $60-70 range, so
retail shouldn't be that much more.

Has anyone tried them??  Let me know
