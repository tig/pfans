And I'll be going thru registration either late Saturday afternoon, or
early Sunday morning, driving on the rallye Tuesday morning, and auto-xing
with Jason on Wednesday afternoon (class P9).  I will also be working track
setup on Monday morning (I'm not much of a Concours person).
I hope the Parade Staff was able to honor my badge request - I asked them
to add the line "PorscheFan".  See ya'll there.
