 But I want to know is it possible to bore and stroke the engine to

Khalid,

Having spent my children's inheritance and the better part of a year
boring, stroking and building my 944 turbo, in a word "don't".  For
starters, price a S2/968 crankshaft, used, if you can find one, will run
$1000 and up, new just under $3000.  If you do not choke on that, give
Andial a call for pricing on their stroker kit (pistons and rods)around
$5000 retail if memory serves.  I thought I was going to beat the game by
using cylinder liners, J&E pistons and Cunningham rods.  Those parts were
all a deal but the other parts and labor made the national debt look small.  

You will not be able to get more than 3.1 L out of a 944 block and will
have to sleeve the cylinders to get that.  My engine is 2.94 L with the
stock S2/968 at 2.99 L.  Unless you install a S2 head, you probably will
not notice the difference in a N/A engine.

If I had to do it over again, I would probably slap on a nitrous bottle
with the best controller money could buy.  The bottom end is strong enough
to handle the power.  

Your trans should hold 400 plus hp and don't worry about the brakes until
they get mushy on you.

If you are interested in NOS, Rod Wiggins has done more research than I
have, email him.  

Your best move would be to find a nice S2 (I did) or 951.
