Hi Fans,
Our local constables have started embracing photo radar with a passion.  I
don't want to start a thread on pros and cons - (I hate the damn things
since it takes the skill and fun out of avoiding tickets).  Our defendant
govenor (who's begging for popularity now) has come out endorsing a ballot
referendum to eliminate them.

 My question:  I have seen several cars with plastic covers on the license
plates to presumably prevent them from  being readable from an angle by the
radar camera.  some look like plain plastic but I'm not sure how well this
would work and would prefer to get something designed (diffraction grating?)
for this purpose.  I haven't seen them advertised so does anyone know of a
place that sells specially designed covers for this purpose?
