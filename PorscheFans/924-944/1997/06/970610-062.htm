I had a Whistler Spectrum Remote detector in a previous car mounted behind
the front spoiler.  As an experiment, I also mounted a Passport detector
high on the windshield next to the rear view mirror.  On a 400 mile test,
they both found the same signals at essentially the same time.  I was sure
the height would make a difference, but it didn't.  Granted, these were
older technology units, but I wouldn't worry about the signal loss too
much for the radar signal  The laser detector is another matter, however.
I'd bet money height would make a difference in that case, hence, the
remote laser sensor mounted discretely up high seemes the best solution.
What brand was that one that someone mentioned/
