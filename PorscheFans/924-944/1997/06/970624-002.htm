     Input sought from other tall 944 drivers. 
     
     I am 6' 2"tall, and I keep my seat at its lowest setting to avoid my 
     head hitting the roof over bumps (car has a sunroof, which doesn't 
     help).  This also means that my legs end up pretty well straight out, 
     and I find it difficult to keep my right heel optimally placed on the 
     heel mat (my car has aftermarket overmats). My foot is always slipping 
     forward onto the accelerator pedal, particularly if I'm wearing 
     business shoes, rather than trainers. This makes long journeys pretty 
     tiring on my right leg.
     
     Am I the only one to suffer from this, and if not has anyone found a 
     way of getting comfortable.  I've tried moving forward so that the 
     flat of my foot lays on the pedal, but the angle of my ankle is then 
     too extreme for comfort, and in any case I end up too close to the 
     clutch pedal.
     
     Any ideas short of surgery appreciated!
