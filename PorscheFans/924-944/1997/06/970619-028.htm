Kory,
     You don't need any magic machines to replace these joints. The old joint 
is removed from the bottom, after you remove some glue, and a clip. New parts 
can be obtained from replacement joints for the earlier A-Arm, which is the 
same replacement part for VW rabbit A-Arms. The only difficult part is 
creating a SHIM. The replacement parts are a bit too small, requiring the gap 
to be filled for correct tightness. I did look at several different non-OEM 
Ball joints at local auto shops, they all varied in size.  I will send you a 
copy of a post of mine from April 14th with more details on this. If you find 
replacement parts that are the correct size, it should be an easy rebuild. 
Otherwise, you will need to create a shim.
  Rebuilds cost >= $150 per arm plus shipping, and good used A-Arms will cost 
$200 and up, if you can find them.

Good Luck! Keep us posted!

Ezra
