Hi Terry,

Every 924 and 944 I've ever owned, and every one my friends have owned,
have all had the 944 shimmy at 60-65 mph at one time or another.  There
are endless threads on how to get rid of the problem and why it exists
to begin with (VW suspension heritage, imbalance in wheels, etc.).  Here
are some of the more popular highlights...

- Whenever my car does this (and it is doing it right now), I check the
tire pressure all around.  This usually helps the most.  My shop just
did a balance and alignment and the whole problem started up, so I think
they probably did a sloppy job that I'll have to have them redo it.

- Many threads speak of nothing solving the problem short of an "on the
car" wheel balancing by a very good meticulous shop.

- Some folks maintain that you have one front wheel stud on each side
that is painted, and that the factory has balanced the hubs and marked
this lug nut to denote that you should mount your wheels with the valve
stem aligned with (ie. outside of) this lug.  Even more picky, some say
that your wheel centers should be aligned so the crest points at this
lug and the valve stem.  I haven't tried this yet.

- Some folks say they can't fix it, so they stop slowing down to 65 ;-).

Hope this help.
