I just got back from Bridgehampton after 2 days of Drivers Ed with the
new baby - an '89 Turbo that is chipped. What a difference from my last
car, a NA '84 944, somewhere in the neighborhood of twice the power! 

I started with a suspension setup that would hopefully wear the BFG R1s
evenly and provide mild understeer to learn the new car: 2 1/4 degrees
negative camber in the front with zero toe and 1 1/2 degrees negative
camber in the rear. I started with full tread depth on the R1s and ran
them for 2 hours of track time with no signs of unusual wear. I ran the
first day with 27 lbs all around and the second day with 26 lbs. 

I guess the next step is to drop the ride height about an inch with the
M030 suspension and (hopefully) with the bumper height adjustment
mechanism in the rear. I guess reindexing would be a bit expensive. Does
anybody have an idea of the time and complexity of the job to reindex?
I'm also putting the stock chips back in to increase the reliability.
Besides, 247 HP is enough for now!

Would anybody like to share their suspension setups with me, either
publically or privately? I'd like in particular to hear from any club
racers who use the BFG R1s, but I'd also like to hear from autocrossers.
My intention is to have a streetable car that is fun to autocross and is
a blast at the track.

Also, does anybody know an effective way to temporarily disable the ABS
such as pulling a fuse? I found the system a bit disconcerting on the
track in dry conditions, but I'd obviously want it enabled for the
street or at the track in the rain.

Regards,

Paul Foster
