Hey! Whats Up? I've been reading for a while and this is my first post.
I run an 86' 951 97,000 miles, luv this car!! I have had it for 3 years
and I work on it myself.  Anyone ever drop the oil cap down behind the
engine? Put some hot glue on the end of a long stick fish it down, stick
it to the side of the cap, let dry for a minute and pull it up, or you
can take the whole care apart! Anyway (Yes, it did happen to me) I have
a lot of info and a scanner so if anyone needs anything drop me E-mail
or if you post I'll try to answer. If you're thinking of changing you
rims and your not shure what would look good I found this really cool
program at (The Tire Rack) www.tirerack.com It's called the
Pitstop-interactive fitment guide. you down load the little program It
shows a picture of a 944 and across the bottom all the rims that fit
your car, click on the rim and it puts it on the car very cool if you
have'nt seen it check it out.(No, I don't work for The Tire Rack) 
See-Ya!!!!
