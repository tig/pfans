I had a very similar problem with my 86 944T.  It turns out a connection
to the wastegate cycling valve had broken.  This valve is under the
intake manifold near the firewall.  You can reach in and make sure the 3
air/vacuum lines are hooked up securely, and that the electrical
connecion on top is good.  I am in the process of replacing my valve
now.
