I lost you reply to address so I hope you see this here. 

I followed your advice and purchased a replacement joint for an early
944/Rabbit to use for parts. Upon dissassembly of the new joint I
discovered that the replacement I purchased has a ball diameter of
approximately 1 inch. The stock ball on my '86 944 is 1 1/16 inches.
You stated in your e-mail of 6/19/97 that you had to apply aluminum
tape to increase the diameter of the Rabbit joint for a tight fit. If
yours was the same as what I bought then you built up arond the plastic
ball socket to get it to fit in the a-arm bore. Is this correct? If so 
I would caution you that the upper hole in the a-arm is larger than the
diameter of the ball which means that the only thing retaining the ball
is the PLASTIC socket. If the fingers on the socket shear under wear
and/or load, the ball will come free.

My solution was to machine the replacement forged socket to fit inside
the a-arm. This gives me a strong metal retainer for the ball. This 
is definitely not the way to go for people not able to do their own
lathe work but is working well for me.

What really burns me up is that I cannot find a source for the correct
replacement parts. You were absolutely correct that it is a very simple
assembly which could be replaced without even removing the a-arm from
the car!! If one could only get the proper parts.

COME ON! somebody on this list should know of a source for the 
ball, plastic socket, spring etc... for this assembly.
$150 to $200 is just too much for something this simple unless the wear
is excessive and has damaged the arm. This should be a $30.00 fix.
