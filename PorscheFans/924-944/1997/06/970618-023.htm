I pondered Wes Shew's questions about the concept of "How to setup PCA tool  
rental?" Some suggestions are below, and they probably parallel the loaning  
policies of most tool leasing operations:

<<Where would the tools be stored?
Possibly at the regions' president's/treasurer's home, etc., or at a  
volunteer's who would have cost-free access to the tools.

<<Who would be in charge of lending them out?
Whoever was storing them.

<<What if someone damages it?
There would be a prorated assessment based on the extent of the damage, if  
the tool was not paid off - leasing them out at a price will ultimately pay  
for the tool, and any excess over the original price will go towards buying  
the replacement.

<<Do you charge for using it?
Yes... but only for replacement purposes, not profit.

<<What kind of deposit $ would be involved for the lendee?
For those who become involved, a credit card number would have to be  
provided and charged if damage or loss is incurred, but only the  - this is  
the commitment that one has to make for the service.

<<How long is it given out for?
That depends on the size of the job and waiting list. This could be  
determined by the members who have experience with the tools.

<<Do you fine them if they are late to return?
Definitely yes if there is a waiting list, otherwise let the members  
(especially those who plan to subscribe) decide.

<<Others I may have missed?:
Responsibility of original purchasing, legal waivers and leasing agreements,  
users will have to pick up and drop off, availability of experienced tool  
users and documentation could be done through incentives (cost-free access to  
tools, break on membership dues, or just plain appreciation), records of  
rental and cash received should be regularly released, fees should be sent to  
president or treasurer.

I would get a list of willing participants, ask them these questions, and  
use some sort of quorum voting to resolve the above-mentioned issues. If done  
right, this could be a constructive use of the club network... if not, then  
there is going to be some misgivings. It seems only right that if we have a  
common problem (expense and hassle of Porsche repair), then we work together  
to unilaterally resolve it to our mutual benefit.
