I have had both Koni and Tokico, I prefer Tokico. I autocrossed 4 years, nearly every weekend, towed a trailer, and at 130,000 miles called Tokico as I had to run the Ft shocks on 2 insted of 1, and they sent a new set no cost. These are still on the Honda. over 300,000 miles. I also have a set of HD on the CRX and they are very good , about a 2 setting , on the adjustable shocks. They would be just fine for anything , I would not get the Adj . again.
