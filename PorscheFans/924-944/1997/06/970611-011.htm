Hi Bjorn,

968 problems? Here's my experience.

It seems that if you overrev the engine (perhaps by downshifting too early), 
you will stress the conrods and one of them will eventually let go. This is a 
costly exercise, so I'd advise against overreving the engine!

I know a guy who races in club supersprints who recently blew up an engine 
this way, and it's not the first instance of a 968 letting go like this.

You can take a preventative measure against this possibility. I believe 
there's a Carillo rod replacement package that you can get for the 968. These 
rods are much tougher than the standard ones, and should let you overrev your 
engine as much as you like. ;-) Also, I've heard there's a 3.2 stroker kit, 
which has replacement rods, but I don't know how strong these are.

Apart from this, my 968CS (CS means Club Sport, available in the UK and 
Australia, and maybe some other markets - 17" rims, 928GTS brakes, stiffer 
springs, adjustable shocks and anti-sway bars, and about 80kg lighter weight) 
has experienced strange suspension wear. I've had one front strut replaced, 
supposedly due to incorrect manufacture, and I've replaced all the bushes in 
the front suspension after 30,000km, resulting in a huge improvement in 
performance (they weren't supposed to be worn out by 30k but they were!). I'm 
up to 40,000km now, and will get all suspension bushes replaced at this 
service for good measure (they're cheap).

Note that my car gets a hard life, both on the road and regularly in 
supersprint events at local race tracks. so keep this in mind when you think 
about the suspension wear I've experienced. I don't condsider it at all 
unusual under the circumstances.

That's it. From all I've heard in the year I've had mine (a '95 model, by the 
way), there are no other problems at all!

Regards,

Clayton
