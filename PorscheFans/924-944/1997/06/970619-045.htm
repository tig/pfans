Hello,

I just bought an '87 924S. The previous owner couldn't give me the owners 
manual. So I have a few beginners questions.

Firstly, could any of you suggest how I could get hold of an owners manual.
Could you also suggest some good repair manuals.

Now for the more pressing questions:

My radiator seems to leak after I stop the car. It stops leaking after some 
time. What could possibly be the problem? How do I check to see if the problem 
is with the radiator or with the water pump i.e how do I check if the water 
pump is working fine?

I also cant locate where the coolant chamber is? (You see I dont have the 
owners manual and dont have much experience with cars)

When I do a cold start, should I let the engine heat up for a while before 
driving? Also, when I do a cold start the engine rpm seems to oscillate 
between 200 and 1200 rpm and does not become steady until I have driven the 
car for a while. What do you think is the problem?

Thanks for the info,
Anoop.
