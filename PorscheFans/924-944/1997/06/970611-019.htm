you guys may need a radiator flush/descale...

when you rev it, you spin the water pump a little more, so the increased
circulation lowers the water temp somewhat...

my car ran like the two above, and I also replaced oil cooler seals, low
temp t-stat, and put in a low temp fan switch... I also replaced the
radiator... my car runs cooler (though the famous Georgia heat has not
kicked in yet...) if my car even starts past the lower hash mark, fan kick
on and it quickly returns and sits on the lower hash... if it performs even
close to this when the outside temp hits 98 degrees, I'll be thrilled
beyond belief...

my old radiator was full of oily goo from the leaking oil cooler seals, so
I have an extreme example, but I think the new radiator is quite helpful in
my case, though a good flush/descale may help ya'll...

PS- the low temp fan switch is great, the low temp t-stat is alright too,
the car just take a while to warm up... by the time I'm ready to bust a
move, I'm where I was traveling too, which means I have to miss my exit on
purpose, hit a backroad, get in a second/third gear curve or two, and then
wind my way back to the original destination... the things we put up with...
