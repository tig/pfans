I had a good look at a 968CS two years ago, and I saw some differences:

The seats was low weight (kevlar?) buckets and the back seat was taken
out completely. The lower price than the 968 coupe was partly because it
had only a few 'goodies' as standard. Also, the front and rear bumpers
looked suspiciosly thin and compliant, and may have been thinner. I dont
remember if there was a spare tire, or if it just had a spray can of
rubber goo.

No aircondition, no power steering, no power windows and no sun roof
will contribute to lower whight, and I think they were options instead
of standard items. Thinner glass (or lexan behind tha A-pillar) have
been 'standard' on other Porsche RS (Renn Sport) models so that may have
been like that on the CS (Club Sport) too. 

The 968 coupe was significantly more expensive than the 968 CS, too.   

Very nice car...
