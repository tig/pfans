 Hi - new (89.1 N/A) 944 owner here.

 It was in immaculate condition (112k, but perfectly maintained by one
         fastidious owner)
 until the Bastards broke into it last night.
 OK, after three days they knew where it was (concealed in locked garage)
         and appear to have been
 halfway professional (no sign of forced entry, but completely destroyed
         ignition/steering).  How did they
 know where it was ?  Followed me home ? Maybe. Car Dealer ? Unlikely.
         Insurance Co. ? Possible.
 Licensing Centre ? My best bet.
 Anyway - it's off being fixed, and if it goes again it's up for sale !

 Anyone got ideas on how to keep these things ??  It has a Factory Alarm
         (LEDs in door locks etc), but this
 obviously didn't deter them.

 By the way I'm in Perth, Western Australia - any other downunders wan't to
          talk 944, EMAIL me
 at ian_saunders@ferntree.com.au

 IanS.
