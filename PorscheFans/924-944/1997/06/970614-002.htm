Lead article in this most recent issuse of Pano, refers to a 968 Club
Sport. What is the difference between this, and the 968 equipped with
the M030 option? TIA steve meltzer resurrected '88 944 turbo s, Zermatt
silver. Mechanic wannabe, Mac Believer <G>..

Steve,

The 968CS was marketed as a race car that could be utilised on the road,
with a weight reduction of 50 kg over the standard model.
The main differences were :-

- Fixed Recaro Bucket Front seats ( fore & aft adjustment only )
- No Rear seats
- No Driver Airbag 
- Manual window winders
- No Central Locking
- No Radio/Audio System
- No Airconditioning
- Light Weight Electrical loom
- Manual Rear Hatch release

Standard Equipment on the CS was the Additional "Sports Pack", this
encompassed upgrades to the brakes, suspension and drivetrain.
The Sport Pack was termed the P30 option and was announced in the US in
1992, but failed to appear till the 93 model release; according to
Excellence DEC 92. This option was only available on the Coupe.

- Firmer Springs and 20mm lower ride height than the standard car
- Height adjustable Dampers with rebound adjustment
- Stiffer anti-roll bars
- Upgraded Front Calipers ( 928GTS )
- Cross-drilled brake discs front 304mm vs 298mm
							rear  299mm same

- 17inch Pressure cast Alloy Wheels 
- Sized 7.5inch front, 9 inch rear ( 225/45 & 255/40 ) 
- Torsen Limited slip Differential.

Several options for the CS existed which gave prospective buyers another
chance to increase the price!
- OPTIONS - deletion of the sports pack ( though why you would want to
do this? kinda defeats the purpose of buying the CS in the first place).

- Blaupunkt Paris Radio
- Security package, Central locking, alarm, wheel protection
- Electric sunroof
- Adjustable front seats 
- Fold down rear seats and electric hatch release
- Drivers Airbag
- Electrcially adjustable mirrors
- Power Windows
- Airconditioning
- Replacement of Fixed buckets with normal front/rear no cost option.

I hope this has helped to clarify the differences, and by the way the
car is something special; like all Thermodynamically Optimised Porsches.
