David,

As a fellow 931 owner, I know that you have quite a job ahead of you.  The
wiring harness is not the only thing to worry about.  The vacuum and/or
pressure lines are also a royal PITA to re-install if you are using new lines,
which I would strongly suggest you do.  After 17 years, my 1980 model was
sucking and leaking so much ambient air into and out of various places on the vacuum harness that many of 
the devices on the harness were rendered null and 
void.  I had a chance 10 years ago to change out all the vacuum hose but didn't since everything was so 
easy to re-install with hoses that were fossilized
to fit every turn, nook and cranny.  A couple of years later those fossils
began to crack.

I would gladly take your calls on Saturday, but I'll be at the beach with the
wife and kids for an extended vacation doing anything but work.  The toughest 
part about replacing the engine wiring harness is on the top of the engine 
where everything intertwines with the vacuum hoses, pressure duct, fuel 
injector lines, etc.  When I discovered that the price of a new engine wiring 
harness was about $500, I opted to put many of the wires in hot locations in 
protective wire looms.  Your spark trigger wire (coaxial) from the distributor 
magnetic pick-up to the spark box may be hardened from heat up near the 
distributor.  I think some turbo heat gets up there.  If it's brittle, be 
careful not to crack it.  This could short the center lead to the shielding and
you'll never see a spark plug fire again.  Took me many days to find that one!
You probably already know that the connections behind the head require a very 
thin hand with 12-inch fingers to re-connect once the engine is in place.  You
might want to try making those connections before you bolt the torque tube and
tranny on.  Just tilt the engine forward a bit.  

Oh yeah, if you've not yet replaced those awful factory cables from the battery 
to the starter, you might want to do that while the engine is not bolted in.  
I think most 931 folks are in general agreement that Ferry's folks dropped the 
ball on that one.  I was getting a good 13.5 volts from the alternator to the 
starter, but for reasons I could never explain the battery was never getting 
more than 12.5 volts on the positive starter-to-battery cable.  This may be a
problem on the 924NA also.  The upgraded cable kit ($100+) solved the problem.

Good luck.  I'll be back on-line on July 8th.  If you're still trying to find
places to connect wire terminals at that time, drop me an e-mail.
