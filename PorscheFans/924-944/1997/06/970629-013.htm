Hi folks:
Got a few questions to pose to the wisdom of the list.
1) My exhaust headers are cracking where #1 meets #4 (about 1/3 of the way around). Is this the common failure point? (86na)
2) I am not sure what the headers are made of, can they be welded easily? (I own and am reasonably good with a MIG welder.) Have other had success with welding the crack(s).
3) I need to unravel the great mysteries of the fuel injection system. at small throttle openings the car is a little rough, surging mostly. Always runs good at full throttle except sometimes at low PRM in 5th. I have already installed a new O2 sensor (some improvement) and fuel filter. Removed and examined the air flow sensor. throttle, plugs and injectors, all looked good. I have learned from various sources that the fuel pump is a variable (2 speed?) device the goes to full pressure at full throttle. If anybody knows what the typical failure is it would help. I am leaning (PUN!!) towards low fuel pressure causing a bad pattern at the injector or a lean condition. Is this more likely that an electrical / computer problem? If so is the regulator adjustable or could it be the fuel return gizmo?
4) Does anyone know when the hell the shop print manuals will return to publication????? (8 months and waiting)

Thanks for whatever help you can offer.
Chris White
