Hi Barry.

I would have to disagree with you on that point.  The way I see it is that
running a race on a "road" type course with lots of turns and straitaways
makes the race much more challenging for both drivers and teams, where the
driver's skill in particular will allow him to pass, or crash for that matter.
In retrospect to the oval NASCAR courses, where you can apparently just keep
the gas pedal to the floor throughout the entire race, I see less challenges
to the drivers.  Just my opinion.

Yes I am very familiar with the IROC races (International Race Of Champions).
I saw the first of four after the Detroit Grand Prix on June 8th.  It is no
surprise to me at all that the NASCAR drivers would win.  I would expect that.
Reason - quite simply I see the IROC series as just another type of NASCAR race.
These cars are closer to what the NASCAR drivers are used to than are the open
top cars that CART, IRL, IMSA drivers are used to, so naturally the NASCAR
drivers have a huge advantage. Turn the tables for a second now - if Dale
Earnhardt (a.k.a. The Intimidator) was to race against Michael Schumaker at
LeMans both in a 911GT1 - who do you think would win?

True, but I don't think these guys race on ovals.  From what I understand, and
correct me if I'm wrong, these are on road courses similar to Grand Prix
courses.  Maybe I'm a "techno freak" but I prefer the engineering and high
technology used in open top car racing, as opposed to the "Detroit steel
mentality" of NASCAR.  I'm sorry Barry, but when I lived in Charlotte, NC for
2 years, I didn't meet a single NASCAR fan who wasn't a "good ole boy".

Not trying to start something here - just giving my .02 opinion FWIW!
