Does anyone out there know of some way to evaluate CV joints for excessive
wear short of opening them up for a visual?  Do these joint 'click' as on
FWD cars when worn out?  I noticed recently that with the car (85 944 N/A)
in gear (car shut off) I can push it back and forth a few inches before the
driveline 'slack' is taken up.  I know a certain amount of back lash
(necessary) in the ring/pinion set up would account for some of this,
however, it did appear that the half shafts were a bit sloppy. 
Specifically, the inboard CV joints could be rotated slightly relative to
the shaft.  I did this with the car at the mid-point of the 'slack' and
grasped the inner CV joint body and was able to rotate it back and forth
about 2 or three degrees relative to the stationary shaft (and outboard
CV).  It felt as though there was some sloppiness within the joint (or
possibly the spline on the end of the shaft).  I was not able to get any
movement when grasping the shaft itself and trying to rotate, which I
believe indicates that the outboard joints are tight (this was all done
with tires on the ground).  The car has a lot of miles (160K) and original
joints.  If anyone has some insight on whether this condition is normal, I
would be much obliged.  Perhaps someone can check to see if they get
similar movement when the car is pushed back and forth in gear. 
Incidentally, I did replace the clutch about 8 months ago and so am pretty
sure this is not a clutch related peculiarity.
