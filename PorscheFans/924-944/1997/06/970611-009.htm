Yes, I guess I started that thread. I had a 924 turbo spoiler I wanted on my
car, so I drove all around town to every body shop and every glass shop I
could find. Nobody, and I mean *nobody*, wanted to drill the frame. After
the first couple of visits I drove home and took the yellow pages with me in
the car. When I was fed up, I just told them to glue the thing on, and they
did. It was not my first choice, but it looks nice. If anything happens to
the spoiler I can't take it off, but since I have full insurance getting a
new rear window complete with spoiler is only a matter of finding the right
size sledgehammer.. I know it is *possible* to drill the holes, I just
couldn't find anyone to do it for me. I didn't want to do it myself.

As for the 944 and 968 spoilers, they use exactly the same holes as the 924
turbo spoiler. Those who have a 944 and want a 968 spoiler can just switch
them without drilling any new holes.
