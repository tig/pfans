Karl,

The first thing I'd try, is the product I always use on a car from day 1,
which is Gunk's Foamy Engine Bright.  I use this on my cars every 4 months
or so and it keeps the engine bay looking brand new.  I was lucky that my
944's PO kept the engine bay spotless, so it wasn't a chore to clean the
first time.  I just sold an '88 Honda Accord Coupe with 212k miles and the
engine bay look as good as the day I picked the car up from the dealership
in '88.

I've had a great experience with this product but others may have some
better suggestions.  I wouldn't hesitate to use a pressure washer under the
hood.  I don't need to because the Gunk works so well.  Also, make sure you
get the Foamy stuff (blue can) because the old Gunk Engine Bright (orange
can), from what I've been told, isn't that great for rubber components
under the hood.

Good Luck!

Michael Belfoure
