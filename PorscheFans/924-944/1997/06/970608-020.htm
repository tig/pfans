I saw a comment on the last list about an Audi wagon made by Porsche.

On my last trip to LeMans (1985), I was at a Petrol staion outside Le
Mans when one of the Audi R4 wagons pulled in.  The German driver was
only too happy to show me his prize.  The red "Porsche" brake calipers
shown through the spokes of the 17" rims.  Upon opening the hood, the
silver and red valve cover displayed "POWERED BY PORSCHE" in red
letters.  He spoke of 325+ hp from the Audi 20V 5cy turbo'd engine, and
said to date, nothing had ever passed him on the Autobahn if he didn't
want it too...(grinning all the time).  Wonderful car!!

While at the factory in 1992, we saw the MB 500E's being built.  Porsche
would build the bodies and send them to M-B for the paint job on special
dollies.  They then came back to Porsche for assembly (including the
Porsche tweaked 325+ hp 5.0L engine. The test drivers would exit the
factory gates, turn left (the Porsche drivers went straight on), and
would accelerate up the hill like there was no tomorrow.

I was not fortunate to drive one of these "Porsche clones" until
1994...WOW...much better than any 928 I had driven.  In 1996, a lady
dentist friend called me and said she saw the prettiest silver M-B at
the dealership..."Would you check it out for me"..."I think it is a 300
something, or 400, or something like that".  When the salesman drove up
and it was a 500E, I asked him if he knew anything about this style of
Mercedes...you can imagine his answer..."Yea, it's silver and in nice
shape"...he hadn't a clue.  Easy 150MPH. on a test drive on a particular
abandoned "test" track we use.  Extreme acceleration...probably 0-60 in
about 5-6 sec. (this car also weighs almost 2 tons).  I would pit it
against most stock 944 turbos.  Wonderfully balanced car...a real
tribute to Porsche engineering and workmanship.  

Well, she did buy the car...60K on it now...a real pleasure and blast to
drive

Just wanted to pass on a couple of stories.  Thanks for reading...Don
