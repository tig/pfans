The "stepped" nature of the boost on the 944 Turbo is a result of the
tuning on the KLR chip. The KLR is probably the most sophisticated boost
controller available on any street car. It's a completly tunable (at least
for me :) ) feedback controlled system with the desired boost programmed
as a function of throttle position and rpm.

On a general note, German tuning of their engine control systems has never
seemd to focus on smoothness. That is a major part of what you get from
*some* aftermarket chip tuners. For the 944T, we try to make the feel as
linear, almost non-boosted, as possible. For those who want a real
kick-in-the-tail turbo feel, we could do that too.

Drilling the cycling valve removes the KLR from the control loop. You have
just taken a major step backwards to mechanical boost control.

One last comment on the knock sensor. It is far from perfect! Your car
can happily detonate to destruction with this very early version of knock


control in complete oblivion. Even if it worked perfectly, you would not
want to tune against it. Because it takes a typical retard of seven
degrees to stop knock once it occurs, you end up spending ~80% of your
time below optimum timing when running on the sensor. On a turbo engine,
this probably costs 10 to 15% in power.
