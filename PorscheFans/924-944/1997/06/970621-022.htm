"The verdict?  There are many good reasons for buying a Carrera.  The
timeless shape, the powerful six-cylinder boxer engine, the way it is
put together, the urge to demonstrate that you have mastered the
monster, the obvious prestige value.  It's tempting.  And yet, for
effortless driving pleasure and near perfect roadability, take the 944
Turbo.  It is the better car."

Granted, the C2 is a better car than the Carrera, but a chipped 951 S is
a better car than a stock '85 951.  I think CAR's conclusion still
applies.
