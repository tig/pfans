You got a great deal, I paid $30 US for a used plastic one in good shape. 
Only 1 magnification setting and a 35 watt halogen lamp, but it is plenty
bright.  I like the plastic construction, as it is light and easy to move
off the kitchen table into a closet when I am done looking at the fiche.

I mail ordered mine from Carlsen Porsche/Audi in Palo Alto, CA.  Ask for
Linda, and the Porschefans discount.  I think I paid $14-$16, and a dollar
or two for shipping.  This was 6 months ago, so the price may have
changed. The phone number is +1 800 523-2408, or +1 415 856-6300 if the
toll free number is not reachable from your area.  You might want to have
her toss in those silly little dealer only parts, like the clutch
inspection hole cover, the little rubber plug above the distributor,
interior trim, etc, since the shipping won't be any higher.  I did.  I
also asked for and received at no charge a Porsche Parts Express price
list, and the EuroSelect parts and technical reference catalog (mine only
covers up through '88 model year).  Might inquire about later cars. 

The 'fiche quality is acceptable, but some of the photos are poor.  Even 
so, it is well worth the price.  And you can always go to the library or 
nearby university to make photocopies of desired pages or sections.

No business interest in Carlsen, just a satisifed customer.
