Hi, I have two strange  intermittant problems:

1. my fan switch always works in postion 4, it will work in position 1,2,&3
for long periods of time, occasionally if I turn off the car with the fan
on (1,2,3), when I restart with the fan on it will run for 10 seconds, then
cut out and will not turn back on until I restart the car several times.
In the past it has taken only a few starts (few enough I can play with it
in traffic), but its been out for a week now.  Any suggestions?

2. my climate control seems to want to go hot occasionally, but not
permanently.  I've looked for the spring and clip, but cannot find the rod
to confirm (its not on my floorboards though).  The heat comes on, I can
get it to go off by moving to AC for a few minutes until the air cools.
Then if I turn it off, it stays cool for about 20 mins, and sometimes is
cool for days.  Any ideas?  I think the two problems may be linked since
the heat problem has only started since the Fan has had its 1,2,3 problem
for the last week.

Thanks,
kschweik@ub.com
