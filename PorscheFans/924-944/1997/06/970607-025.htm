That was me.

Great instructions Gregor, I just finished the modification last nite.

When I desoldered the #9 spade the 2 diodes became unconnected, this is
normal. With a little patience I resoldered the 2 diodes.

Actually it's preferable to use a terminal "X" power source, which fuse
#25 happens to be. The difference with X power is that it is not hot while
the starter is running. This saves more battery power for starting the car
in case you left the fog light switch in the on position.

Be sure you feed the wire to the inside leg of fuse #25. If you tap
the wire into the outer leg of the fuse, you've actually bypassed the
fuse. I replaced the fuse with a 10 amp rating instead of the 25 amp
originally intended for the heated seats. 10 amps should be ample to
trigger the fog relay.

I went crosseyed looking at the Pano wiring diagram and this mod seems to
be A OK. If you happen to have OEM heated seating I'm not sure which fuse
would be best. Don't use unused #12. But unused #26, 29, or 34 MAY be X
powered. From the electrical diagram it looks like you could hook into
empty relay #G15/terminal #87 and have fused X power. Double check
yourself before trying these.

Thanks again Gregor for the excellent instructions!
