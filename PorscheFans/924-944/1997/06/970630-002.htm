First I'd like to thank all who sent suggestions for this problem.  Second,
 apologies for the double post, I received a mail error on the first. As
embarrassing as it is to say the problem was that both tail light bulbs had
blown at the same time.  A test for voltage revealed that both lights were
receiving power.  A continuity check showed the bulbs to be faulty (a bulb
can LOOK good).  The old axiom bears repeating: start with the most simple,
inexpensive assumptions and work your way up.  Not many P-car repairs are
$1.59.

In regard to the post about power window switches, they are repairable.
The switches can be removed with a small screwdriver by carefully prying
them out.  The contacts inside the switch need to be cleaned as they
oxidize over years of use.  Any one that needs further detail may contact
me directly.

Lastly, my '84 944 sunroof opens and closes fine but does not operate in
the key off ignition position for the roof to be locked or unlocked for
removal.  When lowering the roof, the lifts retract fully.  I have to raise
the lifts slightly so they engage the roof to lock it down, but not raise
it.    Annoying.  Any help is appreciated.
