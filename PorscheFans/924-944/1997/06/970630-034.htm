I find all of these comments very interesting.  I too figured you must be
exposed to my .02 worth.

My chipped, mass flow kit equipped, Borla exhaust, hollowed out cat., K&N
cone filtered, dual fuel pumped, rising rate fuel pressured '86 951 is
tremendous fun.  The car has the factory sport suspension and LSD.  It
accelerates like a bat out of hell and is a bear to auto-X.  With 60,000
miles it does not feel like a time-bomb but rather a silky smooth, free
reving, pure bred sports car.  I love to drive it for all of this.

My factory stock '92 968 cabrio with 20,000 miles on the original Pirelli's
is also fun to drive.  The car feels stiffer than the 951 (which needs new
springs but has new shocks) and corners very, very flat.  The acceration is
deceptive.  The torque curve feels very flat.  I'll never know what it is
like to auto-X in this car.  I have decided that my hobbies are far to
expensive and don't want to romp on this car.

That is probably why I get behind the wheel of the 951 far more often.  Now
that I mention it I seem to take the 968 out only when going on a date with
my wife.  For me, the 951 rules.
