Hey dudes,

Ok, let's first start by saying that I've lost all of my ability to drive.
I have totally lost it, I might as well sell the Porsche and buy a Toyota
Supra or something!  Seriously though, I'm on a bad driving streak.  Well,
I didn't drive that bad considering I only walked the course once (I was
in charge of registration so I was occupied).  But, anyways, if Jacque can
say he drove crappy, so can I :(

This was CACC Regional #3.  The points to this date were something like this,
Patrick Ma at 200pts, Harry Dether at 190pts, Tim Stark at 189pts and me at
188pts.  After that were numerous others such as Darren Foo, Lance Patrick,
Richard Cho and Rich Hoffman.  

The course was pretty good, but I could not nail it for some reason.  The runs
went like this:

                          Run 1   Run 2   Run 3   Run 4
Patrick Ma    96 911TT    45.822  47.371  44.864  45.139
Tim Stark     88 944TS    47.219  45.364  45.427  44.987
Harry Dether  89 Carrera  47.007  45.918  45.303  45.407
Me            89 944T     47.253  45.625  45.686  45.428
Lance Patrick 94 348TS    DNF     47.216  46.344  46.693
Patrick Tsai  89 944T     47.958  47.216  48.055  46.421
Richard Cho   90 Corvette 46.629  50.572  46.845  47.059
Darren Foo    88 944T     49.140  52.628  48.004  47.684

I don't know what it was in this course.  I have no idea how Tim Stark pulled
out that last run out of the bag.  On my last run, I almost bit a curb.  I
came into the last section really fast and stepped on the throttle to get
a good shot into the stop box, but the car stepped sideways quite violently.
I had to get on and off the throttle 2-3 times to keep it from going ballistic.
I even tried WOT to keep the back planted, but it walked sideways even more.
Oh well, I suck.

Paul ran Darren's car as his clutch isn't feeling too good.  He got it down
to a 46.487, but even he felt that he didn't drive the car well.  We didn't
spend any time walking the course and helping each other out.  We also seem
to do much better when we are both driving similar cars setup with similar
components so when one goes faster than the other, we both push harder to
match the other's time.

There was something in that course that I missed.  Wes, in his S2 looked to
be having another bad day.  I spoke with him after his run and mentioned a
few things I noticed about his lines, mainly one corner actually.  He went
out next run and set a blistering pace at 44.247 (he was running 45's all
morning) and then fine tuned the run even further to a 43.731.  Wes was 11th
fastest of 99 cars!  Good job Wes!  He makes it all the more depressing to pull
in a 45.xxx time in a car that looks visually identical to his car.
Oh well, if Wes can rebound, so can I!

The points for A/SS class now sit as follows:
                          
Patrick Ma    96 911TT    300
Harry Dether  89 Carrera  290
Tim Stark     88 944TS    289
Me            89 944T     286
All of the remainder are under 200pts.

With me missing two events in the late summer due to my trip to Germany, my
attempt at trophying in the CACC Regional series is now over.  I have two
more events I will be attending and that won't be enough to catch 2nd or 3rd.
I will try, but it looks hopeless.  It's too bad it turned out this way,
I had everything ready at the beginning of this year, but the race tires got
stolen and I had to run street tires for the first two events, that really
set me back.  Hopefully next year will be better.  Oh well, at least I could
hang with the race tire guys with my streets!

Farzaan.
