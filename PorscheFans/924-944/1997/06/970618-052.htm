Then tbk@sn.no (Thore Bjerklund Karlsen) answerd:

What I call passlight is what happens when i pull the blink switch up,
(you konw, blink blink I'm coming through :) For some reason the lights
in the bumper are working i parallel with the main lights. I would have
suspected that turning the light switch once would give me driving
lights, but it only goes to parking. Maybe theres some thing I'm doing
wrong?

I had the same question month ago. I let my car electrician to do a
minor modification. Now I can turn the knob just one click and then the
parking lights will come on (as they did before), but now I also have
the possibility to turn on my foglights (in the front spoiler). And it's
the solution. Before the modification the foglights didn't come on
without the headlights to be raised. I don't know if the foglights are
allowed in Denmark for day use. But I even don't know if the lights in
the front spoiler are foglights (there's no benefit to use them in the
fog) - maybe they are just driving lights.

I'm still trying to figure out what to do, James' suggestion sound like
a good one.

Thanx
