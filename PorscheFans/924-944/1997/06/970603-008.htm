Thanks for the info. I checked it out.

If this is the case, then it's got to be one of the best performance
increases created by adding a chip, intake system and cat-back.  Anyone
know if this is due to fiddling with the variable cam timing? Powerhaus
doesn't provide similar packages for any of the other na models. Maybe this
is a lesson for some of us looking for cheap but huge power gains in na,
non-968 models.  Also interesting that the current Road and Track issue has
an article on Dinan-modified M3s indicating that similar modifications
produced almost the same gain in hp, but essential no gain in performance.

The Powerhaus turbo conversion package for the 944S2/968 is really
interesting. 400 hp for about $20K. Basically a 944 Turbo with a 3.0 liter
block, based on the Porsche design sold in Europe.  Hmm. Anyone care to
donate a Turbo head, intake and exhaust system? I promise to let you drive
the finished product a few times a year. 

By the way, MGW, let us know what you think of the performance when you add
the Powerhaus package.
