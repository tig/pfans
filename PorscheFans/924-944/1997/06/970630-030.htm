I came across a 1990 944cab. with 23,000mi.  The price
is very good.  It needs a radiator and thats it.  Does the
car share the same radiator as the Turbo?  Anyway upon further
inspection I began to notice a few things.
First it had no airbag.  I thought this was standard?
The dealer said it had never been hit.  How can one tell
if a car has been hit before?  Also is this just an early
'90 with no airbag?  I also noticed that the spacing
between the left front fender and door is not equal.  Can
that be adjusted?  Ok now onto the engine compartment.
The engine bay is very mint.  No sign of repair.  Just
perfect and clean.  However I did notice that the VIN#
was etched on the inside of the hood, fenders,and trunk.
Again the dealer had no answer.  Another item I saw was
a service sticker, but it was not in english,  It had some
european phone #.  This makes me very curious.  Maybe this
car is a euro-model.  What is the difference
between U.S. model and the Euro version?  Maybe the original
owner was in the military and brought this baby over, is
this possible?  
I'm a first time porsche buyer,  so any advice I can get
would be great.  Send any suggestions, helpful hints to beastie@put.com
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
