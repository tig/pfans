Bill -- 

I just got a Mityvac yesterday and bleed my brake system. Maybe I'm using
it incorrectly, but here's my conclusions.  I couldn't effectively suck the
fluid out using the vacuum alone. And unless you really secure the hose
fitting to the nipple, you're sucking in a lot of air at the nipple trying
to evacuate the brake lines. But if you use the vacuum to make sure no air
is entering the brake lines when you crack the valve by applying a little
vacuum after you attach it to the nipple, you can pump the brake pedal and
get the fluid flowing into the Mityvac. This flow will slowly eliminate the
vacuum, and you can watch the brake fluid flow into the tool (if you
position it within sight while you're pumping the brakes), and check for
air bubbles.

This method took me two trys, but I've got solid brake pressure now.

So the tool seems to be useful for making sure no air enters when you crack
the bleed valve, and its also useful for making sure that a minimum amount
of brake fluid gets on the caliper paint. And - oh yeah - it sucks all the
fluid out of the vacuum hose into the Mityvac reservoir, which makes less
of a mess in the garage.

Anybody out there able to actually such a lot of brake fluid out using only
this vacuum pump?
