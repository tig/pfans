Anders Svensson wrote much about the police in Sweden:

<<It has been a lot of Police Bashing the last week. 

It makes me feel real bad to hear about this.>>

<Many kind remarks about the police snipped>

Hi Anders,

I think the whole issue is which side of the law you find yourself.
During the 60s in the US, many people who would in all respects be
considered law-abiding citizens found themselves on the other side of
the law; the side normally habituated by the criminals and the
minorities. It awakened in people the idea that there is typically a
very great difference between law and justice.

So with this heightened awareness and suspicion of authority, the 60s
generation became the status quo of today. Now driving Porsches,
Ferraris, Ducatis, and the like, this generation found that it isn't
very difficult to view the police as the adversary on the highway. After
all, they seem to just be out there to enforce ludicrous highway speed
limits (I don't drive 55!) and ruin our driving fun, right?

Personally, I consider the vehicular police the same way I view NY
cabbies with their 'available' lights on. They are sharks which will
typically feed on the easiest nearby target. But sometimes they are
attracted to the bright shiny fish which swim really fast. When the
shark is with other sharks he can tell a much better story if it
involves catching one the the faster swimmers, particularly if the
target tries really hard to get away.

I'm certainly not trying to advocate running from the police if you find
yourself becoming shark bait. I'm just trying to explain this 'us vs.
them' game we have with the local constabulary is not really due to our
yahoo western heritage of shooting first and asking questions later. We
reserve that birthright for the late-arriving relative who didn't call
first, and we forgot had a front door key. ;)

As a New Yorker, believe me when I say I truly respect the police.
Without them, this city becomes a war zone inside of 5 minutes. It
actually happened once in Times Square in the 80s when the police
weren't on duty for a 30-minute stretch. Now, under Gulianni (sp?), the
city is much safer than it has been in recent history thanks in great
part to the men in blue. 

But if I take to the highway in my 944 turbo, the radar detector is
armed and I'm constantly scanning for the nearby shark. Rarely do I
exceed the magic number of 9 mph above the speed limit until I know the
front is covered by a brightly-colored fish or two and there are no
fast-approaching objects from the rear. If I do become shark bait, I'm
very polite and always ask if they want lemon with their meal.
 
All IMO of course,

Paul Foster
