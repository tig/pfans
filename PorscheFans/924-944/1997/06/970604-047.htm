You will get a number of opinions on this question since it is a question
that recurs frequently on this list. So, FWIW:

I have an 87 951 which I use in about the same fashion you describe. I run
MetalMasters on the street and Hawk Racing compound on the track. Since I
have to bleed the brakes before every track event anyway, swapping pads is
a cinch, and the Hawks do not require bedding in. And yes, I do like the
Hawks. I found the MetalMasters unacceptable for the track.
