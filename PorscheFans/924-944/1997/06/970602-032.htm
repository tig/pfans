I am wondering if anyone else on the list has had problems with there fuel
gauge and water temp. gauges. These gauges on my '87 944S have not worked
properly since the car went out of warrenty years ago. The fuel gauge will
show full when the tank is topped off, but will never go past the half full
mark even when the tank is empty. The reserve fuel light will come on when
the tank approaches empty, but the gauge still shows half a tank. The dealer
replaced the sending unit in the tank and also the round gauge cluster (
containing the fuel and water temp. gauges ) after the warrenty period was
over but this did not solve the problem. I had him put my old parts back  in
the car, and bid him farewell . The problem with the water temp. gauge is
that it will read correctly occassionally, but is "pegged" to the top in the
overheating position most of the times. I can tap on the dash above the gauge
and the dial will come back to the normal zone momentarily and will then
immediately jump to the overheated position. Both of these gauges failed at
different times, but since they are in the same gauge cluster could it
possiby be a fault in the printed circuit board ( or plastic sheet as it
looks like )?  Guess I could live with the fuel gauge not working (looks like
I have doesn't it?) but the vehicle may overheat someday while I assume the
temp.gauge is just "crying wolf again" and really ruin my day. Please let me
know if anyone has experienced these problems before and how to fix them if
they have done so.
