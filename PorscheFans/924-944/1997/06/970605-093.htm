I just happen to have the magazine at work!!!  I would have responded earlier,
however today was a busy day...  I guess you have to take these kinds of
stories with a grain of salt.  The magazine is Road & Track, August 1996.

The porsche in question was the Performance Developments Porsche 911 Turbo.
 The car had ~600 hp.  It did *not* have ABS.

0-100-0

PDP 911 Turbo (without ABS) :

7.6 seconds to 100.  6.1 seconds from 100 to 0.

P 911 Turbo (with ABS) :

9.4 seconds to 100.  4.6 seconds from 100 to 0.

>From their test, the PDP 911 Turbo was the *slowest* car to go from 100 to 0,
out of *all* the cars tested.  By contrast the P 911 Turbo had the fastest 100
to 0 time out of all the cars.

The strange thing, the Dodge Viper GTS stopped in 5.4 seconds (no ABS).  I
would have thought I tricked out 911 would be able to stop quicker than the
Viper.
