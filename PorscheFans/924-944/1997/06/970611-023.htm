     You can actually buy one made by Porsche for your 944. Most dealers 
     don't know about these, but I got mine from Sonnen in San Fransisco. 
     It was about $400 as far as I remember and by far the best investment 
     I've made in my 944S2 Cab so far. The difference is unbelieveable. 
     Sonnen used to advertise this product in Excellence - if you want me 
     to I can try to find their phone# for you.
     
     Thanks,

Hello all,
Having owned my 944S2 cab for about a year now, I have given a lot of thought 
to a solution to decrease the wind noise and buffeting at high speeds.  It 
seems that the 968 cab included this feature.  Does anyone know if a 
windscreen from a 968 cab can be purchased and retrofitted into a 944 cab 
without too much effort?  I have even contemplated making one myself but 
since Porsche has already done it, why reinvent the wheel.
Thanks,
Mike Diamond
