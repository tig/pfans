Hi - new (89.1 N/A) 944 owner here.

 It was in immaculate condition (112k, but perfectly maintained by one
         fastidious owner)
 until the Bastards broke into it last night.
 OK, after three days they knew where it was (concealed in locked 
garage)
         and appear to have been
 halfway professional (no sign of forced entry, but completely destroyed
         ignition/steering).  How did they
 know where it was ?  Followed me home ? Maybe. Car Dealer ? Unlikely.
         Insurance Co. ? Possible.
 Licensing Centre ? My best bet.
 Anyway - it's off being fixed, and if it goes again it's up for sale !

 Anyone got ideas on how to keep these things ??  It has a Factory Alarm
         (LEDs in door locks etc), but this
 obviously didn't deter them.

 By the way I'm in Perth, Western Australia - any other downunders wan't 
to
          talk 944, EMAIL me

Getting ripped off really ruins your day.  I have found a excellent 
deterent, it is black, weighs about 70 kilo's and has large sharp teeth! 
(no not my wife)  since I got her no one has messed with my cars 
although once after a rather vicious session of barking I found a tennis 
shoe inside the fence.  Nothing else just the shoe.  Didn't look inside 
for a foot. Still have the shoe waiting for previous owner to come clain 
it.  The dog looks at it rather fondly from time to time also.
