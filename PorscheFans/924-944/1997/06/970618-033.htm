You can find this MAG at Borders Bookstores. IF not the address:

EXCELLENCE  
P.O. BOX 1529
ROSS, CA 94957 USA
TEL: 415-382-0580

It is an independent pub, totally unrelated to Pano. or PCA.

Hi Marv,

Thanks for the reply! Look below I have addressed some of your questions

NO!  Unfortunately nothing that obvious.  Just not much power.

Hmmmm . . sounds like a clue to me.

I will add that to the list of things to check.

The plastic body panels that make up the lower nose and tail sections, from
the top of the bumper down.

I paid 14.5K for an 89 with 88K miles.  The car is as spotless as you could
expect it to be with 87K miles on it.  I have some pictures on my web site
if you care to look.

Recently! I think at 80K the belts were changed.  I have all the
documentation, but there is a lot of it.  I have not gone through it all
yet.

Fortunately I have a very good friend that owns his own shop.  He has
several computers that are much more sick than my car.  Having a mechanic
that needs your help to is a good thing. (smile)

I figure if I only spend 3-5K per year in maintenance I am doing good.
