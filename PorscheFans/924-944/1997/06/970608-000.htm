Sparkplugs come in all kind of shapes and materials these days. The
current maintenance costs makes it very important for car manufacturers
to build as maintenance free engines as possible, hence the variety of
'strange' long-life plugs. Spark plugs can be optimized for a number of
things, and effecient spark is just one of many design parameters. 
Resistor sparkplugs was mainly utilized for making less radio
interference. These days, a lot of onboard electronics depend on that
'less interference' capability, so using non resistor plugs close to a
lot of complicated electronic circuitry, even if the spark itself will
be 'better' (and the plug cheaper) may cause unwanted and nasty side
effects. The ignition module, the coil and the wires will be designed
for a certain spark plug type, so going away from a resistor plug may
cause problems on other components in the ignition, aside from the
interference problem.           

While plugs rely on 'exotic' materials to survive, mechanical propertys
play a big role in its function. The spark jumps easier between 'sharp'
electrodes, equally important for both anode (the tip) and cathode (the
prong). The mechanical breakdown of these vital parts is a continious
process, and is slowed down by utilizing materials as platinium and
silver in conjunction with the usual cupper-nickel alloys. Some people
think this is voo-doo, some people swear by those features.     

Because of the importance for 'sharp' edges on the electrodes, and the
fact that they disintegrate (slowly), different configurations of plugs
exist. Among the sucessful variations are the multi-pronged plugs, with
two (Splitfires), three (Bosch, NGK) and four (Bosch aftermarket)
prongs. A backside to those plugs are th fact that they 'mask' the
spark, and, hence, combustion chamber design and relative plug placement
may cause slight ineffeciencies bexcause of delayed or unoptimized flame
front propagation - but this is usually not a major problem. Some people
are 'indexing' their sparkplugs, so the open part of the gap points in
the right direction, though, and for those, this may be relevant.      

I use traditional, 'cheap' NGK resistor, single prong plugs, that I
change every 6000 miles. I pay around 16 dollars for four plugs.
The reason for using 'simple', no-tech plugs is the (subjective) fact
that every time I change the plugs look OK, not visibly worn, but still,
I feel a difference, especially at acceleration. When I tried platinum
Bosch's they did not hold out any longer, the edge wore off as quick.
Changing more often, but to less expensive plugs, is (for me) simply a
economical way of keeping the engine running better.
