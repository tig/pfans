<<Last week I couldn't unlock my '89 944S2 driver's door. Still some
clicking when I turned the key and the passenger's side worked fine.>>

Yes, this sounds familiar, my car has that problem on both sides.  The =
failed part is a plastic arm, about four inches long, that connects the =
door button to the lock mechanism.  The button connects to the arm with =
a ball-and-socket joint, and that is what has failed on both of mine.  I =
tried to wire the plastic arm to the 'ball' part of the door button, but =
eventually the wire breaks.  I have fixed both locks in this manner two =
times.  It is such a pain in the ass to take the door interior off, that =
I won't do it again until I have a better idea.  What it really needs is =
a metal part to replace the plastic arm.

Let me know if can come up with a better solution.
