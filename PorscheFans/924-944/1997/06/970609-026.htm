Ben, on my car,86 turbo, the G12 relay is for the driving lights. The G8
relay, on my car, is for the warning buzzer, and that relay was removed by
the PO.  My car always starts fine without the relay, so I doubt it is the
problem. I hope someone  can help you out better than I can.  By the way, I
went to my clubs driver education  school and a good tip I found was to wrap
a old clean rag around your master cylinder in case the fluid starts to
bubble out from all the hard running on the track. It seems one driver
learned the hard way and  when the brake fluid bubbled over, it hit his turbo
and whooosh, instant fire. Some of the other drivers also plastic tie a sock
around the power steering reservior.  Colin F. '86 951 red, of course.
