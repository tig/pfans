Hi Jason
I completely agree with your comments.
I meant that by lowering the car a little there is no danger for bottoming
of shocks and that
in my experience the 944 is much more stable in long high speed turns with
the rear shocks set
stiff then at softer settings.

In my case with a low weight car and very stiff torsionbars and sway bars
at the back the suspension
hardly moves. There is no danger for full compression of shocks, but it is
wise to be carefull
and leave some rubber bumper in place.
regards
Peter

Remember most adjustable shocks like Koni's are adjustable for rebound.
Setting the rebound stiffer won't control bottoming, that would be a
function of the compression stroke.

bump rubbers function is to prevent the shock from fully compressing. In
that situation the shocks internal workings become the bump rubber and that
can lead to a seriously compromised shock lifespan ( you'll blow it out
eventually). If you've lowered the car enough to need more shock stroke,
shorten the bump rubber and put it back on.
