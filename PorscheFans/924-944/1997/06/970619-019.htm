Where would I get this updated kit?  Dealership? Mailorder?  The problem
I have 
is starting when the ambient temperature is cold (<50 deg).  At first I
was told
the problem was with the ignition switch, but after replacing the switch
the problem
remained.  I've checked the voltage out of the switch, and it's 12.5
volts.  (I
checked this at the three wire connector in the engine compartment).  I
then checked
the voltage at the starter moter and fount it to be 9.5 - 10 volts. 
When the meter
reads 9.5 volts the solinoid won't ingage (no clicking noise).  At 10
volts or above
the solinoid  kicks-in and the car starts right up.  This doesn't sound
like
the battery to starter cable issue.  Has anyone else experienced this
problem?
Sounds like I need to replace the battery to starter cable and the wire
from the 
engine compartment connector to solinoid.
