Welcome back from the Dark Side. Just kidding. I had a 944 and test drove a
911 for a weekend, liked the car but I only had space for one Porsche. I got
in my 944 and after driving it for 10 min., turned around and kept the 944.
Since then I swaped into a 951, and yes at the track some
novice/intermediate 911 guys feel that they have the real Porsche (without
knowing I took my 911 back) and ask "when" I'm gonna get a 911? No thank
you, I use my car 90% at the track and with the exception of the 993TT and
some really fast 993 guys you can't beat a 951/s2. Gee, with the
$55,000-$105,000 I "saved" I can afford to go to the track a whole lot. Good
luck with your new toy and I bet it isn't too long before the 944 goes to
the track and the 911 is used for bagel runs! When you get this car to
track, and you will, your 911 buddies will tease you right up to the point
that you lap them.
