Remember most adjustable shocks like Koni's are adjustable for rebound.
Setting the rebound stiffer won't control bottoming, that would be a
function of the compression stroke.

Removing the bump rubber isn't a good idea even on lowered cars.  One of the
bump rubbers function is to prevent the shock from fully compressing. In
that situation the shocks internal workings become the bump rubber and that
can lead to a seriously compromised shock lifespan ( you'll blow it out
eventually). If you've lowered the car enough to need more shock stroke,
shorten the bump rubber and put it back on.
