>I think to answer the question posed by the P-Fan who started all of thi=
s,
is
just to use the OEM stock studs if you are simply looking to put you car
back
on the road. If however you are willing to trade the safety feature of a
blown
head gasket for piston/cylinder damage go with the Raceware or ARP engine=

studs. Personally I would opt for the OEM studs. =


I would be curious to hear if anyone has experienced a blow head gasket
with
the Raceware or ARP studs or a failed head gasket with an O-ring head and=

OEM
studs.

David,

Here are my thoughts on the matter:  I am a firm believer that all
information that will save our engines from an untimely death should be
shared.  If someone has done the R & D to solve a problem and has develop=
ed
a product, great!  Case in point, we bought a air/oil separator from
Milledge.  Even though it is a rather simple product, people will continu=
e
to buy it because they know it has been tested and it works.  I could giv=
e
everyone a detailed discription of the kit but by the time they sourced t=
he
parts and spent the time doing their own R&D, they would be money ahead t=
o
buy the kit.  There is not much about engine technology that has not been=

published so when we share something it is usually public knowledge anywa=
y.
 =


On the go fast stuff, each builder has what he condiders his own secrets.=
 =

I have yet to meet a top builder that didn't think he new more about engi=
ne
building than the other builders.  Even when they do find out what the
other builders are doing, they usually refuse to pay any attention to it.=

However, I agree that what a builder does to get power out of an engine i=
s
his method and should not be shared without his permission.

I had a battle with my engine builder when I took pictures of my J&E
pistons and Cunningham rods, he had designed, sitting next to the stock
turbo pistons and rods.  He was afraid that "they" would see the wrist pi=
n
placement and the length of the rods.  I finally asked him if he saw a
picture of someone else's pistons and rods would he try to copy them.  Wh=
en
he replyed, "Why would I want to copy someone else?", the discussion ende=
d.
 He never again said anything about me sending engine parts pictures to
friends.

I blew a stock headgasket with stock head studs.  I blew a wide fire ring=

gasket with Raceware studs and a o-ring.  I melted a piston running a
copper headgasket, a double o-ring and raceware studs and all in #4
cylinder.  The problem is not the headgasket, the studs or the torque.  T=
he
problem is that the stock turbo intake manifold makes #4 run too lean whi=
ch
causes detonation and blows the headgasket when you crank up the boost.  =
I
know this  because we just got done testing the manifold on my builder's
flow bench.  For some reason this doesn't happen on all engines, only a
lucky few.  I will post the results when our testing is completed.
