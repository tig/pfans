 I have a bleeder valve in the wastegate line leading to the intake.
With the valve fully closed I get stock boost. When I open the valve
pressure bleeds out and I get more boost by keeping the gate closed
longer. If you were to somehow put a clamp on the hose and tighten it
just a small amount wouldnt that lower the pressure the wastegate line
recieves? Also maybe thinner hoses?? It would seem in theory that if all

hoses conecting to the wastegate were
..375" you could reduce the diameter on all hoses and also lower the
pressure that way?? These are not tried & tested methods as I never had
to lower boost pressure!!

Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you are saying, but what I am trying to
do is raise the pressure.
I have had some advice to remove my cycling valve and connect the ProFec
Stepper motor from
this area and then to the wastegate instead of coming off the front of
the engine at the banjo bolt.
I will probably try this when I get time.  I'll have to remove the
intake manifold to do this.
