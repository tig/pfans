dgreenbu@peganet.com asked:

>in the right rear wheel well there is a metal pipe wrapped in rubber that
      comes from the front of the car towards the back and stops before it
      reaches the back end of the car. I have never seen this in any coupe.
      Can any of you cab owners tell me what this is?

sorry if this has been answered already - i had to go back to digest mode
      due to the volume...........the 'metal pipe' you speak of is a
      counterweight installed in the cabriolet to counteract body
      vibrations resulting from the removal of the coupe top.  you can get
      a good description of all mods made to a coupe in order to become a
      cab from a porsche tecnik specification book - my porsche has them -
      it is invaluable for working on the cab's doors, trunk, top
      mechanism, and does tell you where and how the cab frame has been
      stiffened.
