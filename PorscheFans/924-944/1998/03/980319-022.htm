If you're going to build any type of box for a 944, I would investigate
the use of fiberglass and resin.  You can very easily conform the shape
of the box to any panel of the car.  Simply get a thick gauged plastic
tarp and set it in the area you want to fill with a sub-enclosure. 
Spread it out so that the plastic is as close to the metal surfaces as
possible.  Then get some fiberglass sheet material and cut it into
strips of about 4"x12".  Soak the strips (a few at a time) in resin and
set into the well, on the plastic.  After you have covered the entire
area, pour a heavier coat of resin over the strips for added thickness
and reduced resonance.  Once the "mold" of your well has dried, remove
it from the car (might be slightly difficult if there are metal
protrusions in the well that you are filling.  You may want to grind
them off before starting).  Cut a piece of Medium Density Fiberboard
(MDF) to the shape of the top of the well and cut out your sub mounting
hold, then fiberglass it to the mold. You should now have a sealed sub
enclosure that fits snuggly into your well.
	I have a pair of 12s in my spare tire well (yes I'm driving without a
spare, but that's what the AAA and a cell phone are for!) and get
incredibly accurate, tight bass.  I competed in IASCA competitions for
about 6 years, and have had an enclosure like this one in my last 2 cars
with great success.
	If you are anywhere near San Diego, I highly recommend going to Fritz's
Autosound and Security.  They built my last 3 competition vehicles and
really know their sound systems!

Good Luck to you,
