I'm sorry but this is not true. The oil-pressure-sender has two terminals:
one for the gauge and one for the LOW-Pressure-light (when the pressure
drops beneath 0.5 bar).
The oil-level sender only checks the level when starting the car. If you
have low-level, the only way to extinguish the light is to shut off the car
for about 2 minutes (and refill oil).

When the pressure-gauge is acting normal and the low-pressure light
flashes, I think you have a false grounding in the circuit.
I have a faulty sender in front of me, and the grounding can come from the
inside of the sender. In my faulty sender, the gauge was pointing zero or 5
bar (never somethimg in between) but the low-pressure light never came on.
I other words: replace your oil-pressure sender. This is most likely your
defect.
If you want to try before you buy: disconnect the biggest connector at th
pressure sender. This is the terminal witch says WK. My sender has a blue
mark at this terminal. The light shouldn't light up again. If you have the
wrong terminal disconnected: you have 5 bar oil-pressure, even when the
engine is not running.

Part number is 928 606 203 01.

Success,
