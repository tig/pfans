Jesper,
 No special tools are needed, and I would highly recommend cleaning it before 
buying a new unit! Perhaps some one else on this list can give you some more 
advice as to your high CO content, perhaps there is another culprit. You will 
need to remove the black plastic cover. It is held on with caulk, use a sharp 
blade to cut through the caulk, and pry the cover off. Once you have the cover 
removed, you will see the resistive trace on the circuit board, and the wiper 
which makes contact with it. You will need some contact cleaner/protectant to 
clean the resistive trace. Here in the US a company called Radio Shack sells 
some stuff that works ok, but higher quality cleaner/protectant sprays are 
available from electronic parts suppliers. You might find the right stuff at a 
store that sells stereo equipment, it would be sold to clean and protect 
volume controls. Spray the trace, and move the wiper through its range of 
motion several times. This will help break through any oxides and dirt. Do not 
touch the trace with your fingers as you will deposit acids from the oils on 
your skin. Once you are satisfied that the trace is clean and protected with 
the light mineral oil that was in the cleaner, re-attach the plastic cover 
with a non-corrosive caulk. I used high temp gasket making caulk. Do Not use 
caulk which has acetic acid in it (smells like vinegar) as it is very 
corrosive....

Let me know if you have any questions.

Good Luck,
 Ezra
