<<<Ok, whoah here. First of all, I will state I have never been to your
region's DEW (driver education weekend). I have no idea if the event was
safe or not, or  of what quality was your education. Why? Because I
wasn't
there. I think people are making the way-too-common mistake of
criticising
technique.

There is absolutely nothing unsafe about the follow-the-leader mode of
instruction. Most professional schools use it. Is it as good as single
instruction? Well, I would argue it depends on the instructor and the
school. If the instructors know how to control follow-the-leader, it can
work. If they don't, big disaster on the horizon.>>>

Good point! Perhaps I was too quick to condemn another program just
because it was different than the one I learned under.

<<<Similarly, most professional schools also put the students in cars
without
instructors right away. How can they do this and avoid carnage? Command
and
control, plain and simple.>>>

You mean FF type schools where it is rather difficult for instructors to
ride along. But I don't think that type of school fits the model of PCA
DE. 

<<<So, imho, if your instructor was good (and this is obviously hard for
you
to evaluate, or ANY of us to evaluate unless we were there), and knew
how
to work the system, then I don't think you had less-than-optimum
instruction. Also, your instructor evaluated you, decided you were safe
on
your own, and let you go. Your instructor was correct, you survived. I
don't think it is fair for any of us to comment on your instructor's
abilities. (Certainly, there is no way in hell I could instruct an
average
person well enough in 16 laps to be on their own. Perhaps you're not
average? Who can say - we weren't there.)>>>

Also a good point. Tom Pultz could be the next Ayrton Senna. Too bad he
learned about it now instead of when he was 20... ;-)

<<<HOWEVER, I think many of us reading your post had warning gongs going
off,
I know I did. Reason? I'm using professional schools as an example.
There
is a world of difference between a professional school and a bunch of
region volunteers. Obviously the level of teaching (and overall
organization) suffers. More importantly, the variance between
instructors
is extreme. This is a long-standing issue in PCA, and a very thorny one
as
far as liability is concerned.>>>

This is my biggest concern. It appears that there is absolutely no
consistencly at all between regions. I am now getting very paranoid
about blithely going to other regions' events.

<<<So, enough from me about instruction. 

There are lots of other issues, though. In my experience, there are two
kinds of driver's schools, and they differ primarily in philosophy. At
the
risk of offending everyone, I'll label them the "intimidation" school
and
the "safety nazi" school.

In the intimidation school, there is this underlying element of
macho-survival-of-the-fittest. Characteristics of this school include
relatively few returnees, students exhibiting exhileration at
"surviving"
the school, many students hiding vague feelings of intimidation, and a
number of spins, organizational delays, and at least one car with bent
sheet metal every weekend. Those students strong enough to survive come
back and overcome. There is a lot of talk about safety, but everyone
knows
the real reason for being there is going fast. Instruction is centered
upon
this mythical "line." Timing is underground, but widespread.

In the safety nazi school, the whole concept of the track as a race
track
is thrown out. The track is merely a closed road for learning how to
drive
smoothly. The "line" is of secondary importance. Speed is irrelevant.
The
course of instruction is designed to put students at ease and
comfortable
with their car. Many return as a result. The rate of progression
(relative
to lap times) is much MUCH slower. Every spin is "discussed" at great
length, every "incident" results in a fear-of-god driver's meeting, the
flaggers have black flags and use them. Aggressiveness is actively
discouraged. Timing is actively pursued. (Ack! Its the stopwatch
police!)

In the 10 <gasp> years my region (Rennsport) has slowly evolved from the
former to the latter. I think that is the trend, driven by liability and
insurance concerns if nothing else. Which is better? Well, I must admit
a
certain nostalgia for the old days and find the new rules (and there are
a
lot more) quite constrictive. However, I can't argue with the facts that
there are now many more local region drivers involved, more people
return
to our events, some making annual pilgrimages over distances I can't
comprehend. Perhaps the most telling difference: In the old days, bent
sheet-metal was expected every weekend and we used to plan for it. Under
the new kinder, gentler regime, we went three years without incident.>>>

This is brilliant! It is going into my 'keeper' folder.

But I think there is yet another element: The track. If you are using
WWII bomber runways with nothing substantial to hit you can be a bit
more laid back about things. If you are running at Bridgehampton or
Watkins Glen you'd better have your car under control at all times on
certain portions of the track because the really bad stuff is only a
couple of feet away from where you should be.

Also, I think most regions are somewhere in between the two extremes you
protrayed. I also don't think all track incidents go away with the
'safety nazi' approach. But three years without bent sheetmetal is a
great record. Apparently, none of the animals^H^H^H^H^H^H members of UCR
invade^H^H^H^H^H attend your events. ;-)

<<<Just my 0.02c.>>>

I'll pay more than that for a post like this!

>What I'd like to know is:
>1)  What constitutes a good DE event in your PCA region?

<<<For me? Not spinning #2 rod bearing. <cough>.

Seriously? Every body and every car leaving the event just as they came
-
no injuries, no bent metal. An event that people come back too.>>>

Absolutimundo! We completely agree on this. Drive within your own
ability level at less than 100% with a well maintained car and you will
probably be just fine. But it still bothers me that apparently so many
people are being turned loose with so little instruction...
