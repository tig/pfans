Hello all.  I enjoy this excellent mailing list even if 99% of it is
technically way over my head.  Keep up the good work!
I have been considering a 1989 944S2 that a fellow nearby is
selling.  The car is immaculate with low mileage (less than
25,000).
1. Can anyone tell me what I should pay for such a car?
2. I know everyone here will tell me to buy it, but a friend of
       mine who has been a Porsche mechanic for 20 years has
       PROMISED me that this car will empty my wallet.  How
       much can I realistically expect to spend on cost of owner-
       ship per year?
3. With this in mind, how do people feel about this idea: I buy
       the car, but keep it garaged, pamper it, drive it only a
       few times per year, but hold on to my little Mazda as my
       daily driver so that I don't have to worry about reliability
       or break down issues.  The hope here would be (a) to minimize
       cost of ownership, and (b) to keep the car in terrific shape.

I would appreciate any and all feedback you knowledgeable
folks are willing to give.  This is a big purchase for me.  My pockets
aren't deep enough to buy the thing and then continue to dump money
into it.  But man alive is she sweet!
Please send email responses to jsb4@po.cwru.edu or to the list if you
prefer.
Thanks everybody!
