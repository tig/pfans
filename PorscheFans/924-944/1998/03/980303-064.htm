Hello,

Take caution if you reply to this message, it goes to various groups.

There are various hotels near Bremerton to stay at.  Paul, Mark and I
have decided to stay in the Holiday Inn in Port Orchard (about 15 minutes
away from the track).  The rates are very reasonable and they have ample
parking.  The nice lady (Rita) did warn me that they have a BMX convention
coming to town, so make sure and reserve beforehand as it's likely everything
will be sold out on friday night.

Holiday Inn's number is (360)895-2666.  We paid US$59 per night for two
nights and we can stick in four people in the room.  THe place sounds like
a motel, so I wouldn't expect a four course breakfast or anything :)

Other hotels/motels, etc.:
Best Western Bayview	373-9900
Oyster Bay Inn		377-5510
Midway Inn			479-2909
Flagship Inn			479-6566
Holiday Inn Express		895-2666	(Port Orchard)
Quality Inn			377-0597
Super 8			377-8881
