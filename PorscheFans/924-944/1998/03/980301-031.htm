Michael,

I don't know how reasonable it was, but I picked one up for $47 at my
local Porsche dealership.  Replaced it last Thanksgiving weekend.
Wouldn't you know it though, I had to replace the turbo timing valve a
couple of weeks ago, so off came the manifold again.  I'm not sure of
the differences between the 944 and 944T, but you can change the knock
sensor and the engine temp sensor (NTCII) without pulling the
manifold.  Other than that, there are assorted vacuum/pressure lines
under the manifold that you might want to replace while you have it
removed from the car.
Oh, and make sure you use new gaskets for the manifold when
reinstalling!

Clark

             (yes, I'm an excited little camper.)

strange, it

out

it.  I
