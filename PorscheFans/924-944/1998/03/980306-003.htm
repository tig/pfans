Thanks to all for the really good posts on oil, oil pressure when racing,
methods of cooling brakes and brake fluid, and brake fluid/clutch fluid
being water absorbent and needing change. It was nice to find out what the
name of my paint code is, too. Thanks a lot. I have learned much.

On the subject of changing brake fluid to eliminate the water that has been
introduced by air coming in through the reservoir, and assuming the
circulation occurs into the clutch fluid as well, do people bleed the
clutch fluid annually, too?

I just did bleed my clutch fluid in the process of changing the slave
cylinder, but did not know that maybe I should have bled the brakes at the
same time. It has been a couple of weeks but not much driving since. And
more than a year since the brakes were worked on. So I am thinking of
bleeding the brakes, now, too. 

And I am wondering about the clutch master cylinder: is it bled by bleeding
the slave, or is there another bleeding point at some other location?

Someone posted that it might be a better idea to just replace the contents
of the reservoir more frequently, using the turkey baster method of
removal. If anybody said there were problems with that, I must have missed
the post. I am assuming it to have been a good idea or people would have
said something. However, consider this:

When I bled the clutch slave cylinder, the first half cup or more was
pretty dark, and then it cleared up with the new fluid coming in. It had 
not been dark in the reservoir even before adding new fluid. So I am
thinking that while water may circulate to the detriment of the whole
system, it may not be true that all the bad stuff will be eliminated near
the cylinders by just sucking out the reservoir frequently. So I think it
might be wise to bleed a little out of the lines now and then as well.
 
However, here is a thought to make it easier, and I would like your
comments on this before I do it: 

When bleeding the brakes, if you have not recently refilled the reservoir
as I have, why not clean out the reservoir, refill it with fresh, bleed
about a cup from each wheel, while avoiding getting air into the reservoir.
That way you don't have as much likelihood of getting air into the brake
lines. I would think that would mean less time and work, too.

Assuming that is a good idea and that you have a partner to push the brake
pedal or a pressure system, is a cup the right amount to withdraw? I would
think it would be a little less, and starting with the furthest wheel and
proceeding to the closest wheel, it would become less with each wheel, and
the left front should be the least, perhaps only a half as much as the
right rear.

Finally, if you are doing the bleeding into a clear glass, is the visible
fluid test pretty good? That is, will the clean looking fluid pretty well
tell you that you have bled enough?
