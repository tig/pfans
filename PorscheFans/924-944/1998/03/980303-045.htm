Howdy,

In the last little while, we've had some excellent emails come across with
real life data on modifying the 951.  I would like to put up a web site with
this information so that it can be easier for the newcomer to decide what
modifications may produce what result.

Does anyone have any objections to me doing this?  I would give credit to
those who wrote their post.  I will try to get a collection of dyno runs from
all over the world and their exact modifications so that we have a real
life database to pull information from.

One last note, in previous posts, I had mentioned that Powerhaus tends to
underrate their stock car numbers.  Notice that they ran their stock 86
951 in 3rd gear and their modified cars in 4th gear.  Another good point
made by an alert list member.

Farzaan.
