The best boost controller in my opinion is the HKS EVC II.  It has a manual
dial on the front as well as a high and low settings, no fuzzy logic crap
to screw up your boost curves, etc.  Very simple and easy to use and can
be found used for around US$200, great value.

A good page for used HKS stuff is:

This is the DSM parts trader web site.  If you decided to buy something
there, drop me an email about who the seller is and I'll tell you if they
are credible.  I've never had a problem on the trader before, but better
safe than sorry.

If you want the most simplistic, good boost controller, get the Marc
Hallman boost controller from Buschur Racing (he also has all the
electronic ones too).  It's something like US$100 for the MH boost
controller and worked the same as my EVC I had on the Talon.  It's not
a typical bleeder, it has all sorts of springs, check valves, etc. to
keep the pressure away from the wastegate until the desired level has
been reached, then it bombards the diaphragm with the pressure, and it
opens up and maintains the pressure.

>> Spinning wheels in three gears sounds good to me.
>It is fun but thank God for rev limiters!!!

Yes, thank God for rev limiters!  We did an autocross this weekend in wet
conditions where rev limiters were coming into use often.

>1.  Does anyone have any experience with wither the hybrid Garrett
>T3/T4 turbos or the ball bearing units from Mike Levitas at TPC?

When I went to visit Dave Buschur in Ohio a couple of years back, he had
a ball bearing turbo for me to see.  I can say that it has dramatically
less friction than a regular turbocharger.  You could spin the exhaust 
and compressor wheel by blowing on it, whereas a regular turbocharger
required you to use your hand.  The ball bearing unit would continue to
spin easily, whereas the regular turbo would wind down after a few
revolutions.  Dave mentioned that the ball bearing turbos would require
rebuilding more frequently though (I don't know why though, never asked),
and that all his drag race cars are going ball bearing this year.

Till the next email, seeya!
