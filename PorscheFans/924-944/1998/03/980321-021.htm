 Dave: I thank you for your reply. When I read the Porsche post each day.
One thing comes to my mind. How can you people pay so much to have your cars
repaired. I have been working on race cars for over 40 years. Fiat Abrath
Zucatos, 289 Cobra's, etc. Indy cars ( 12 years). You people act like these
4 cylinder cars are made by God himself. When actualy these 944 ( nice cars
as they are) are very low tech, when compared to what is coming out of Japan
these days. I see repair bills on Porsche of $3000.00 to replace the head
gasket. $1000.00 for a simple tune up. I was just trying to say. If your car
is only worth $3000.00 to $4000.00 dollars why not work on it yourself. I'm
sorry if you find this offensive.   At 06:34 PM 3/20/98 -1000, you wrote:
