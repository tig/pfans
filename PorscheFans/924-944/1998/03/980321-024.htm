My car radio has cut out twice in the last few months. The first
time it started working again. The second time it didn't. Now
I'm plugging around trying to diagnose the problem. There
doesn't seem to be 12 volts going to it. Also, the dash clock
doesn't work anymore. I checked fuse 36 (labelled radio/clock)
and found it works. When I look around the schematics in the
back of the Hayes book I see a radio relay and a few fuses that
don't seem to match the fuses in the fuse box. Any suggestions?

Thanks for your help.

-Peter
