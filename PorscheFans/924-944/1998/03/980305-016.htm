I've personally never dealt w/ these guys and probably won't since they
won't offer wholesale price lists for businesses and that their standard
retail prices are way too wicked high for any sensible regular P-car
owner would care to offer up their Dead Presidents for, regardless of
the product. My guess is that they probably don't care and don't want
our business.....and if that's the case, they will definitely lose our
business as their prospective customers. When dealing w/ the general
public and other businesses, they MUST retain proper politeness and
utmost courtesy, irregardless of the customer's dispute(s). I've been
dealing w/ Automotion regularly and they've been extremely polite and
very flexible beyond the normal means of a business. They were willing
to ship replacement parts or corrected parts free of charge to the
customer in order to maintain customer satisfaction. They realize that
in order to retain their customers and business, the few dollars that it
takes to ship a part 2-day air or next-day service, those dollars can be
made up in the next purchase transaction. They were willing to absorb a
small, minute fee knowing that the prospect of a decent profit awaits
them (and commission if they work that way) by means of another purchase
transaction. They know that the customer liked the services and products
they received and the same customers were willing to go back for more
good service. Plus, don't forget the fact that we P-car owners do speak
to each other, if not by the means of this list, they will call or write
to each other. The bottom line is that reputation is important because
we do pass our good endorsements to another fellow P-car owner. If
Tweeks were to kindly take some friendly advice, maybe they'd get my
business and endorsement. PLEASE, this was not meant to be a flame nor a
public insult. However, you must be flexible and open to suggestions to
"go-with-the-flow" in order to stay in business. Tweeks may think that
they're doing "OK" w/ their current customers, but somehow I get the
feeling that they're missing out on a whole lot of extra customers to
make that extra fat profit, which all businesses would
like........right? Am I speaking the truth or not? As w/ any executive,
regardless of the type of business or politics you're in, you'd say
anything to save face and the reputation of your company. If indeed your
telephone was at fault and disrespectful, own up to it and confess. Let
us know that the appropriate reprimand or corrective action was taken to
remedy that from ever happening again. You have to assure us, the
general public, that we are important to you. And do you remember that
old saying "the customer is always right"? Take heed! It does hold true.
Look at Walgreen's drug stores; they've implemented the slogan of
"Stress-free shopping". Granted it does take a toll on the employees,
they having to listen to complaints of dissatisfaction of all sorts. But
it does keep their customers loyal and coming back to shop again. So, be
kind to the public. We can make or break any business we choose just
like that. We talk, we gossip, we communicate.......pleasant or
disgusted news......we tell all. Again, this was in no way a flame or
any sort of public insult to Tweeks. They have a right to maintain a
business in whatever fashion they choose but their choice selects their
fate. This is only a suggestion to all who wish to earn a profit and not
just "getting by" or "breaking even". Also, if you advertise something
to the general public, stand firmly by it, verbatim. No deviation,
hidden context or meaning, and definitely no fine print. If that was the
case, our lawyers would be practically living w/ us to protect our legal
aspects all the time. I only speak of what I believe in and how we are
to treat our fellow humans.
