Has anyone ever had a leaking head gasket that leaked coolant into the
oil
valleys of the cylinder instead of inb the combustion chamber? (I am
loosing
coolent somewhere and I suspect that is what happening because the oil
cooler and seals are brand new.)

Jason,
Sure have, the problem took an age (years!) to nail and leak and
pressure testing didn't show it up. Only when I found I was using about
a pint of coolant per day and the oil level was rising during the night
did I get my dealer to admit that the gasket was shot. Don't wait for
these symptoms!

Can't help with any info' on doing the job mind.

Regards,

Clive
