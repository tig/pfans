Father of German sportscar Porsche dies 
11:57 a.m. Mar 27, 1998 Eastern 

VIENNA, Austria (Reuters) - Ferdinand Porsche, founder of German sportscar
maker Porsche AG, has died in the Austrian mountain resort of Zell am See, the
Austrian news agency APA said Friday. 

He was 88. 

It quoted the Porsche company in Salzburg, Austria, as saying he would be
buried privately in Zell am See and that an official funeral service would take
place in Stuttgart, Germany. 

No further details were given. 

Porsche, or Ferry as he was known, was born near the Austrian capital of
Vienna, the son of engineer Ferdinand Porsche and his wife Aloisia on Sept. 19,
1909. 

The family moved to Stuttgart where Ferry Porsche came to work in his father's
engineering company, which produced the prototype Volkswagen in Adolf
Hitler's Nazi Germany in 1936. 

A year earlier, Porsche married Dorothea Reitz of Stuttgart. They had four sons.

In 1950, he started producing his first sportscar, the 356. It was succeeded by
the Porsche 911 in 1963.

Porsche, who in the 1930s acquired a vacation home in Zell am See, led the
Stuttgart company until 1972. He gave up his vote on the board in 1993.
