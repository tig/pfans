Nope, the belt was originally set, and subsequently retensioned using the
gauge.  As far as I know the shop set it to 2.7 units on the first
retension at 1800 miles.  It was at this time that I experienced the
increase in noise, particularly in the 1600-1800 rpm range, so I
researched the PCNA Tech Bulletins and found one that said this noise can
be eliminated, or considerably reduced, by using the gauge and adjusting
the tension to 4.0-4.3 units.

The shop agreed to reset the tension according to the tech bulletin.  The
noise is now mostly gone from the previous rpm range, but it now makes
noise in the 1200-1400 rpm range, and it is probably even louder than
before.

I wrote to Jim Pasha (Excellence technical writer) about this problem.
Jim promptly replied that the factory specifies an allowable range of
2.4-4.3.

This could be, but all the tensioners and rollers were replaced along =
with
the new belts.  Maybe one of them is faulty.  I guess I'll just live with
it for now.
