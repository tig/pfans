     I'm posting this for a friend of mine just to see if anyone has an 
     easy procedure to remove the air filter on this S2 cabrio.  If anyone 
     can help please send the procedure to my address and I can forward it 
     to him.  Thanks for the bandwidth.
     
     TIA for any help,

Hay Sam-Well,
Listen, I had a customer today with a S2 cabrio and a list of things he wanted 
us to look at. I was able to help with everything but the air filter element. 
I know it sounds stupid but the Germans have been having a contest over the 
last 10 years to see who could make the biggest job out of replacing your air 
filter. I can see the housing but could not quickly evaluate removing it. 
I looked through everything I had at the shop but could not find a procedure.
