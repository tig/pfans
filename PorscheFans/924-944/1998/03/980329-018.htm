Seeing that there are complaints about post length and relevance these
days, I'll just say they work "sorta fine" and if you're running in street
conditions and street levels of maintenance, the $40 extra is probably well
spent. Any wire using the "OEM" connector (made be Beru), which Magnecor
doesn't, is probably preferable.

Pfans on a budget with an ohmmeter can buy bulk wire and test and re-use
the connectors for a *much* cheaper ($20?) just-as-good-as-new solution.

If you want Magnecor's for philosophical reasons, e-mail me and I can send
you my usual lengthy, wordy, anal, editorial, digest-consuming how-to post
in a few weeks (after I get the car on the road).

- kind of annoyed right now because some kids yanked my 924S off its
jackstands yesterday and the ground's too soft to do anything about it...
