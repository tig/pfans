PFans,

George B. is "Da Man". My car just quit (951S) on Wednesday and two hours of
diagnosis had narrowed the problem to a DME or KLR or both. I called George
to ask about parts availability and he asked about the symptoms. Everything
seemed to be okay and George says "I know what's wrong with your car. The
set screw has backed out of the rotor so you are getting spark but not at
the right time." Bingo!!!

Called the mechanic and he had the car running in five minutes. George saved
me probably hundreds of dollars as you can't return brains. George I don't
care what your wife says, your OKAY.
