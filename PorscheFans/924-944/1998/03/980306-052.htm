Hmm. I sent out a response earlier today backtracking a bit on this point,
but it seems to have not made it to the list (The problems of using strange
mailers to answer mail at work <cough><cough>.)

In any case, I admit I don't know enough about the fluid dynamics involved
to quantify how much the rpm required to cavitate would be raised if, say,
the static oil level was raised 1 cm.

I based my logic on an analogy to water pumps. I relate everything to do
with fooling around with engines back to drag racing small blocks :-) In a
Chev or Ford small block, the water pumps cavitate at high rpm. It doesn't
matter how much coolant there is, at high rpm they cavitate, leading to
large local hot spots, leading to bad things. The solution there is to
either redesign the water pump or slow it down relative to engine rpm
(underdrive). What I forgot (I think) in making my analogy was that the
coolant being pumped is at constant pressure, set by the rad cap.<

Craig,

In reality, with a water pump on a car, if you had a coolant expansion tank
that was higher that the one that was in the car, it could eliminate the
cavitation. It would at least increase the RPM at which the water pump
cavitated. However, actually placing the expansion tank at a higher point
in the car isn't very practical.

The same would be true with the oil level. I don't think anyone can say
conclusively whether the oil pumps on 944s cavitates or whether the pump
suction is becoming uncovered. It is fact that increasing the oil level
would increase the net positive suction head to the pump. However, the oil
pump on the 944 is a positive displacement gear pump. Porsche actually
calls it a sickle pump. The water pump on your car is a centrifugal pump.
Centrifugal pumps are much more prone to cavitation than positive
displacement pumps. I've worked with positive displacement and centrifugal
pumps for about 18 years and I've never seen a positive displacement pump
cavitate. I must admit that I have never dealt with positive displacement
pumps that rotate at 6000 + RPM. I have on the other had seen many
centrifugal pump impellers completely destroyed by cavitation. Therefore, I
seriously doubt if the oil pumps on the 944s cavitate. I think it much more
likely that the suction is becoming uncovered and air is getting entrained
with the oil. Although I've had plenty of engineering courses, I'm not a
mechanical engineer. So, I'm waiting for our mechanical engineers out there
(Is Dr. Steve in the house?) to blow my theory out of the water.

Simply my opinion,
Clark Fletcher
