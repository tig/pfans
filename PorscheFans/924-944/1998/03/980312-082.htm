I have an 89 951 with the usual pan under the engine that you need to drop 
just to do an oil change
I am sure P. had reasons for putting this on the car...my guesses are:
1. quiet the air flow under the car at high speed
2. protect engine from road debris
3. keep owners from working on their own cars

One bad thing they seem to do is help trap lots of heat under the hood...I put 
a vented nose panel on the car and removed the a-c...it would seem the 
increased air flow through the engine
Compartment would  pull a lot of heat out from under the car if the pan were 
not there...
Is this a viable way to lose weight and heat???
Farzaan, Barry, Mike....any comments?
