Ok,

On this tool.  If I am tinking about the same tool as you are, it's a
unit that has a blinking light on it to test the fault codes from the
plug under the hood.

If you can't find one, Bosch says you can make one.

Just go to your local Radio Shack and buy a red LED and a 780 ohm
resistor.  attach the resistor to one end if the LED, then encase it in
an old relay housing or something.  attach two wires comming out, one
from the LED the other from the resistor.  attach barrel connectors
(male ones) to the ends of each wire and you are done!  All for about
$5.00 and an old relay housing.

This was a little help from a bosch authorized service center locally
:)  All I can say is ALWAYS make sure your shop is Bosch authorized, or
you *might* get a hatchet job on the system from somebody that thinks
they know better than the manufacturer.  Like the old 911SC trick of
disconnecting the O2 sensor (81 to 83) and adjusting the CO to 3%
instead of just making the car work like it was designed to with the O2
sensor connected and the CO at .6% to 1%.
