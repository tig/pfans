My dashboard guages and indicators are acting a little strange.  For the
most part they've been this way since I bought my 85.5na a month ago, but
I'm just now getting around to investigating them.

The fuel guage rarely goes above 3/4, even after jsut topping off a tank. 
When at idle, it tends to read even lower.  Idling is another problem in
mycar...  When I let off the gas it'll fall to aorund 600RPM, where the
idiot lights flicker (very dimly, only notice it in my garage at night)
like it's about to stall, I get a slight shudder, then it comes back to
around 850.  Every few seconds you can hear the idle change then recover,
but I see little indication of it on the tach.

The only idiot lights that appear to work when turning the key to ACC are
the brake pad sensor and parking brake lights.

My speedo tends to require a small jolt (an unsmooth shift will usually do
it) or high RPMs before it decides to budge from it's pirch at 0mph.

My MPG guage is pegged at 60mpg.

My voltage guage is always around 12V.

Now, the speedo I've decided is probably a bad spring or something of that
nature.  The idiot lights, I question the sensors (I know foa fact the PO
gave me the car with low oil....  low enough that the light should have
come on for that).

The voltage and fuel guage are what have me worried.  As soon as I figure
out which box I packed my Fluke in (typical, I moved 5 months ago and still
haven't unpacked), I'll check the voltage at the battery, but if I'm
correct, the guage should read aorund 12 when idle, but over 13 when
revved, correct?  What should I see at the battery?  The same?

Could the low voltage be causing the fuel guage inaccuracy?  I seem to
remember something from the archives about a bad external regulator, but I
haven't tried finding that message again.  Could this be the case?  Or
would the culprit more likely be the alternator?  Any recommendations on
how to verify or correct?

Thanks,
