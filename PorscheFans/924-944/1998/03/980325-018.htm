	Hi I've got a bit of a problem that I need some help with.  I was
driving my car today and it up and quit on me.  It's a 1980 924.  It didn't
make any weird noises or give me any warning it just stopped.  I tried to
restart it but without much luck.  I can hear the starter trying but it
doesn't seem to be getting anywhere.  I had my friend try and start it while
I was under the hood and noticed that while my timing belt is in place it
doesn't seem to be turning at all when the starter is going.  Does anybody
have any idea what's happening?

	STU
