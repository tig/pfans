Rob:

I couldn't get your e-mail address off of your post yesterday but I
wanted to let you know that I sent a response to PFans outlining a
recent article on the captioned you might find of interest.

I was speaking with my mechanic/roommate yesterday about your dilemma
(mine too) and he uses an Additional Injector Controller from HKS
($500 retail or so plus the injector) which works great on his C2
Turbo and is easily adaptable to a 951.  This device electronically
controls the rate and duration of the fuel through the extra injector
which would be mounted next to the throttle body.  The AIC can also be
programmed so that it reads a given level of boost and supplies the
required fuel amount.  I've thought about moving to bigger injectors
but as Jim mentioned, idle and non-WOT conditions could make
driveability pretty miserable.

My roommate has used this device in his car for over a year (will
eventually move up to a fully programmable Motec or Haltech unit) and
I've been in the car when he uses it to lean out the mixture to just
the right point.  It is definitely a seat of the pants difference you
can feel and helpful to have if running high boost!

It's on my wish list of mods and if I get it, I let you know how it
works.
