I agree with Roxanne in this one. When I was younger, even when I was
in the college, I've drinked and drived. Worst, and I'm ashamed to say
it, drived really fast. Now I realize that I could have killed, or, at
least, seriously injured someone. One side note, I've never been
involved in a accident, but all my friends was, hopefully, not to much
serious. Now, with 27, more responsible, when I drink, my girlfriend
drive the car. BTW, I'm not a sadist, she never drinks :-)

We will miss you.

About the insurance posts, I pay aprox. US$200/year. Come live to
Portugal, guys!
