My first two attempts at posting this never made it to the list. I'm
 going to give it one more try.  I posted this question some time
ago but, never received a definitive answer.

Does anyone know for sure what stops the sunroof lifting arms
when the reach the fully retracted position? In other words, what
keeps the plastic gears (newer model sunroofs) from getting
stripped when the arms are retracted?

I used to think that one of the limit switches stopped the motor in
the retracted position. However, after working on a number of
sunroofs over the last couple of years, I have since convinced
myself that this is not true. The two limit switches that are connected
together (I and II) at the motor assembly stop the lifting arms in the
locked position.  With the ignition switch in position 2, if the roof is
raised using the up arrow on the console, the arms stop when the
cam at the motor assembly hits limit switch III (on back on motor
assembly and not visible). Then if the roof is lowered using the
down arrow on the console, the roof lifting arms stop in the locked
position when the cam hits limit switch I.  If you then take the
ignition switch to position 1 to retract the lifting arms, as soon as
the lifting arms start to move toward the retract position, the cam
hits limit switch II. The arms continue to retract with both limit
switches I and II made. When moving the lifting arms from the
retracted to the locked position, the arms stop when the cam
releases limit switch II. This leads me to believe that limit
switches I and II only function to tell the system when the roof is in
the locked position. Limit switch III tells the system when the roof
is fully raised. The micro-switch between the sun visors tells the
system when the roof is removed.  Which brings me back to my
original question. What keeps the motor from stripping the gears
when the arms are fully retracted? The only thing I can figure is
that the slip clutch on the lifting motor prevents it from developing
enough torque to strip the gears. Otherwise, why would you have
a slip clutch on the motor. The workshop manual has a procedure
for checking and adjusting the torque for the slip clutch. It
specifically states that the slip clutch must be adjusted if it is out
of tolerance (6 +/- 0.5 Nm). However, it never says why it is so
important.

Sorry this post is so long but, I'm trying to develop a procedure
to troubleshoot sunroof problems. This is one of the aspects of
sunroof operation that has had me scratching my head for quite
some time now. If anyone can shed some light on this, I would be
eternally grateful.
