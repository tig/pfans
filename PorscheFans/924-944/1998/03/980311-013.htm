I "always" take anyone's (especially B&B's) exhaust HP claims with a grain of
salt.  I can believe on Honda's and Acura's there is a big jump in HP, but a
car as well developed as a Porsche, that feat is difficult.  The big reason to
change the exhaust would be asthetic.  Sound and looks.  That would naturally
be the muffler only.  I always frown when someone pulls the CAT on a car that
is mainly driven on the STREET.  Just being socially irresponsible.  For
crying out loud, it is a lousy 5-12 hp *claim*.  The 951 has plenty of power.
Spend the money on driver's, least of all an autocross.  People who have done
this can make more use of 100 hp than someone with NO CLASSROOM experience
with 300 hp ANYDAY.  I have actually seen people LOSE power when they switched
the exhaust.  I can go on forever on this, but most know what I am getting at.

Anyone using the B&B stainless exhaust and cat bypass "test pipe" on =
their
951?  My son Scott is thinking of going this route.  List price is $1050
on the exhaust and $695 on the track pipe, but Powerhaus has the set for
$1200.  I talked to B&B and they claim about 12 HP for the exhaust and
another 5 for the test pipe, whereas Powerhaus claims 10 HP for the
exhaust and 12 HP for the test pipe (using their upgrade package).  

If anyone is using this combination, or either part, what does the system
sound like and did you really notice a significant performance increase?
Also, if you could do only one part of the exhaust would you do the
muffler (for the sound and looks) or the test pipe (for the performance)?
