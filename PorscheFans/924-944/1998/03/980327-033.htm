I used the Weltmeister harness bar in my first 951, a chipped '89.  Most of
you know that this car died at Laguna about a year after I bought it (id est,
1995).  I was going about 50 mph, and hit one of those concrete barrier deals.
Moved it 2-3 inches.

I was wearing TRW/Sabelt camlock belts.  These stayed on my shoulders because
they were fed through the back of my Recaro SRB seats.  The harness bar's ears
were bent slightly.

I have seen Dodge's Brey-Krause products for harness attachment and guidance.
They are really well designed.  If I weren't going to have a roll bar or cage,
and wanted to run a few DE/track events each year, I'd buy his product as
opposed to the Weltmeister.  The Weltmeister seemed well thought out, but not
as robust for track driving.

I also prefer the Brey-Krause strut bar over the Welty or the Racing Dynamics,
even though it comes into slight contact with my intake manifold.  (They all
can touch the motor-- all of the cars are a little different from one
another).
