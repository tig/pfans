Hello.  I am 19 yrs old and have an 85.5 944 that I got for about $5000.  I
think it's a great Porsche for a young person.  Not much trouble with it.  I
do have a few questions.  First, I bought the car in August 97 with "83000"
miles on it.  I don't drive far yet I have noticed that the odometer has been
skipping a few thousand miles here and there when I am not looking.  The
odometer has run up to 105,000 in 7 months.  Is this a sign of tampering
before I got the car?  Also the trip reset doesn't work.  Another question is
that I have gotten my sunroof to finally work.  It was that the little siamese
gears in the motor had worked themselves loose from eachother.  Now when I
lower the sunroof, it goes past the closed position to the unlocked position.
Is this the micrroswitch in the visor or maybe that adjusting screw that runs
parallel to the sunroof motor  that I am not sure what it does.  I am not
talking about the emergency crank.  That would be parallel. Anyone know the
screw I am talking about?  Finally, my front driver-side wheel is noisy,
clunky, popping, whatever you want to call it.  It is likeyou can hear the
movement of the shock absorber or something.  When that wheel goes in a divot
in the road (not even a pot hole) you can hear a clunk or pop.  Sometimes when
i parallel park you can hear a louder pop when I turn the wheels from fully
left to fully right.  Sometimes I am on a winding road and the car leans from
one side to the other you can feel or hear a clunk in that wheel.  You can
also feel it in the steering wheel like something in the suspension got stuck
and then pops back into action.  Is this the steering rack?  I don't think so,
I am just mentioning it because I have lost a little bit of fluid but it seems
to be squirting out near the other wheel near the p/s pump.  Is the problem a
bushing?  Is it a frozen strut?  When I shake the car violently over that
wheel I don't hear any noise.  Maybe that wheel is a little bit stiffer to
shake than the other front wheel.  The shock also seems to be returning back
to normal when I shake it but I am not sure.  One more thing, I don't have
heat or a/c.  The air blows but it is outside temperature.  If I work the
engine really hard I can get hot air for a second.  Anyone have any ideas on
my odometer, sunroof, front wheel or heater?  Thanks!  I love this list and I
try to answer whatever I can which is usually not very often.  Thanks again!
Mike 85.5
