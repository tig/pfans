Justin has asked how to connect a radio in his 84 944 and his timing is
perfect. I have just reassembled the dashboard in my '84 after installing a
new ignition switch and installing a new UNGO box alarm system, following
removal of the old alarm. This took about a week, not steadily working, and
caused me to run through my entire vocabulary of four letter words. First of
all, the early 944's, whether they were originally equipped with a radio or
not, contained a standard equipment radio package. It consisted of an electric
antenna, three $4.00 speakers, and a front/rear fader on the console. That
way, to install a radio, all you had to do was connect the existing wiring
behind the blank faceplate to your new radio. When I picked my '84 up at
Zuffenhausen in October of 1983, it purposely had no radio. I felt that the
$700 that Porsche wanted for that lousy Blaupunkt Monterey AM/FM was far too
much considered what a mediocre unit it was. So, I had a high end Alpine
system installed when the car arrived stateside. I spent quite a bit of time
in 1984 installing the UNGO box and had forgotten some of the details but I'm
up to speed now.
First of all, the '84 does have a switchable 12V input with the ignition off
even though there is no accessory position. As soon as the key is inserted in
the ignition switch, the radio relay is activated by a contact in the switch
which provides switched 12V to the radio among other things. The relay is
located to the right of the DME next to the driver's right knee behind a
pressed paper panel. It's about 1x2 inches mounted horizontally. You don't
need to access this, however. Sorry to say that the relay itself is not
depicted on the wiring diagrams in the shop manual for some reason even though
it's outputs are shown. For that matter, even the standard equipment power
antenna is absent although it's power lead is shown.

Now to get to it:

After removing the radio blanking plate , you will see a black plastic wire
loom with three wires emerging.
They are:

Red/Blue-----Switched 12V from the radio relay to power the radio.
Red/Yellow---From the instrument lights and the dimming potentiometer
Brown--------Chassis ground

And for antenna power, a white wire all by itself.

The antenna lead will be coiled up in the same place.

In my car, there is also a red wire passing through the console but this may
be part of the original radio installation and not present in your car. I did
not check it for voltage. If your new radio requires uninterrupted power to
keep it's station memory alive (mine doesn't), the closest voltage source is
the cigarette lighter which is of course blocked by the heater slides. Nothing
is easy. When I had things apart during the original alarm installation, I
installed an extra rocker switch in the console to interrupt the antenna power
lead so that when using the tape player (it would be a CD player now, of
course) I could keep the antenna retracted.

Good luck,
