 I bought a 83, 944 that had been stored for 4 years, (owner thought it
would go up in price ha ha) When it was started it ran for only a couple of
seconds and boom the timing belt and the balancing belt both broke. I bought
the car with only 42,000 miles on it with a motor lock up. I had to replace
5 valves ( 2 were laying broken on the piston) and had to have the head
welded up and 2 valve seats replaced. This may sound hard, but it's a piece
of cake for a head shop. The cost of the valves were $36 ea for the exh and
$18 for the int. The machine work was $125.00. The total job (me doing the
work) was $450.00. I replace both belts and tighten them with the shade tree
1/2 turn, works so far. While I had the belts off, I took off each idoler
and the cam gear adjuster, here is what I found. The plastic idoler would
not turn and had not for sometime. I soaked it in stanisal over night and
soaked it in lube for 2 days. I works fine now, no need to throw things away
most can be fixed. The cam adjusted when tighten down hit the plastic behind
the gear. I put a thin washer behind the gear and it works fine. Ran the car
easy for 50 miles and retighened the belts (shade tree way) and I have a
nice running car bought right that I am real proud of. Conclusion: Don't be
afraid to adjust the belts yourselves no hidden secrets here just horse
sense. While I was buying parts I found what I believe is a good place to
purchase Porsche parts for a reasonable price. Vortex out of Florida, look
for them in the Excellence mag. You all have a good day I'm off for a drive
in my new, old Porsche.
