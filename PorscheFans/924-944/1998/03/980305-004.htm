Greetings,
Seems to be a lot of heat being generated over this Tweeks issue. I do =
not know the facts and never really will understand what happened unless =
I was there to see it for myself. I will say this. I have purchased most =
of my parts for the 951 from Tweeks. I found the following to be true.
1) Salesman were helpful and friendly.
2) Parts were shipped promptly.
3) All parts ordered were shipped. (no back orders)
4) All parts fit. (after market or not)
5) I had to return a set of Koni shocks/struts and there was no problem =
what so ever for a credit to purchase Sacks. (951 came equipped with =
Sacks, Koni's were inserts, my mistake.)
6) I will continue to order parts from Tweeks and find that they will =
match or beat other vendors prices.
In closing, this has been my experience with Tweeks. I can not believe =
that a salesman would use swear words to a potential customer or sale.
