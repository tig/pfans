Well here I go again, boy will I get flamed on this one. 
Joe if you really want more speed and power for the dollars spent. Have you
thought about putting in a Chev small block? Maybe with some of the newer
aluminum blocks and head combinations out there a V-6 all aluminum, fuel
injection, maybe even turo, but I don't thing you would need it. I have done
a couple of these on 924's and the performance was breath taking. You would
have discontinue using 1st gear, and you would need heavier shocks and
springs, but If YOU Want More Speed, Go For It. Remember guys Carroll Shelby
did this a long time ago, So did the Sunbeam Tiger, two classic cars.\
