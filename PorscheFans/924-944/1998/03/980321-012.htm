     Brother Cooley et al:   

     No offense, but I feel Larry's story is an excellent example of when
to deviate from factory procedures.  He probably bought the car for the
price of the cam belt tool.  Now for a few hundred dollars more he has a
sweet little Porsche that he knows better than I know mine. And I got all
the manuals.
