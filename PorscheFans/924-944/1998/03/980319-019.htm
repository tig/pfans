No offense taken.  I have found out that Jim is not even involved in the
chip for the 951.  He consults on many Cyntex projects, but not this one.
But if you tried a Jim Conforti chip you would quickly become a believer.
On my N.A. E30 M3 Jim gains just under 30hp with a chip and K&N only.  I
have seen the dyno print outs to prove it.  My only comment was that some
can always make a better chip.... (plus, what may be a good chip to the
racer, may not be a good chip to street driver...)

BTW, Jim is currently building a ~700HP E36 M3 he plans to run in one of
those Nevada open road races...  It will be interesting to see how that does!
