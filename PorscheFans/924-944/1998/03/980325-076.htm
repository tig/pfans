Getting signed off on the second day is fine. It happened to me too but
I hope it is fairly unusual in your region. What previous driving
experience did you have?

That's a lot of days for one year! And it sounds like you improved a lot
over the course of the year. I know a lot of concentrated days works
wonders with skiing...

I am sorry to hear that. I think they are a great bunch of people.

I don't understand why you ended up in the green group since you must
have had most of your DE days by then. Which group did you ask to be
placed into on the entry form? What did you say when you found that was
where you were assigned?

I think you must be a bir confused. The MNY registrar is Jeff Goldberg
and he drives a 930. The MNY treasurer is Bernie Dobrin and he drives an
RS America. Bernie may have been running things when you approached the
tower. I'll send your email to him and Jeff and the rest of the MNY
heirarchy to see if we can get this straightened out.

However, I must take great exception with your attitude to whomever it
was. By attempting to deride the individual based upon your perception
of his driving ability is a real cheap shot. As with all PCA run
activities these are volunteers who are putting in the extra mile for
your benefit. You owe him and these mailing lists a public apology.
Shame on you!

I don't see your point at all and what it had to do with anything about
what was previously discussed. It sounds like you had a bad time because
of a screwup in predicting your ability level. You must admit that your
case is rather exceptional. I've heard the same story from a number of
other people who made a trip to a region where they werern't known. But
they didn't get on the internet and whine about it. Get over it.
Mistakes happen. However, admitting that you were intimidating other
drivers on the track doesn't do your credibility much good. This is
supposed to be fun for everybody, not just you.

I'm sorry you got that impression that the rules are set in some sort of
concrete because it simply isn't true. Each individual is appraised
separately and is not moved until they have proven they can handle it.
Barry Lenoble has become an instructor in a couple or three years as has
Rafael Llopiz. I have been doing DE for 2 years after 10 years of
autocrossing. As mentioned earlier, I was allowed to solo on my second
day. I was moved to white at my fifth event, and I was moved to Black in
the middle of last year. This year I'm going club racing.

Are your events covered by your auto insurance policy? Most do cover
DEs. Most policies also have a clause that denies coverage if the car is
raced or is "competing in a timed event" at the time of teh incident. 

I stand by what I said. I didn't time trial in SFR because they required
a roll bar and a drivers suit after two events (which is a minimum if
you are going to time trial). My car was needed to comute to work. I
didn't think it was worth the risk. DE and time trialing are two
entirely different things. DE is Driver's Education. It is NOT timed by
definition. I like it that way!
