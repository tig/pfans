Unfortunately I just took my last dedicated web server off-line, but I'd be
mroe than happy to host it on one of my other accounts.  I can fulfill any
of the HTML/CGI needs that may be required for voting, etc..

I can have something preliminary up by tomorrow morning (less the decal
submissions, of course).

Do we want to prepare and specifications for decals?  Size, decal type
(magnetic, exterior glue-on, interior glue-on, static-cling), etc.?  Also,
just out of curiousity, is there any concern with using the word "Porsche,"
or do they primarily go after people who use the crest without permission?
