The groove of doom ONLY occurs from tires being run with insufficient
pressure.  This situation, according to BFG engineers, is dangerous.  I
would suggest your BFG rep listen to what his engineers have to say.

Having lower psi in the front will reduce understeer and induce oversteer.
A neutral or understeer vehicle is typically a safer vehicle than one that
oversteers.

While it is true there appear to be many opinions on my psi to run, the only
folks that ever speak of the groove of doom are those running with low psi.
Also why is there so much variation?  If you talk to drivers/crew
chiefs/engineers in NASCAR, IRL, F1, Sprint cars, Formula Ford 2000, etc.
you will not find as great a variance in tire pressure among those that run
the same tires as you do with us weekend warriors (yes, I include myself in
this description.)

It is my opinion the best way to learn to drive well is to take a reasonable
car (which all of us have), and, other than minor upgrade such as brake
pads, tires, 5 point harness, keep the thing stock and finally, regarding
tire pressures, take the manufacturers recommendations and stick with it.
In learning to drive you need seat time with all others variables constant.
If you change the variables every time you go out or with every event, you
just end up spending time learning to adjust to different settings and
equipment.

IMHO
