Have you tried a bug & tar removing product?  I think Dupont has a
reputable solvent that you can buy it at any local auto parts store
(which will have several different brands and selections).  These are
very effective on gooey stuff like tree sap, but be sure to re-wax the
area you cleaned to protect the finish.

As Mr. Haynes says, "replacement is the reverse of removal."
"War doesn't determine who's right, just who's left."


seems like nature is fighting back and is starting to polute my car!
My car is covered with , what seems like, very small drops of "tree
juice" (I haven't got a clue what the right english word is). It's
very difficult to get it of. I've tried washing the car twice and
I've also tried waxing and buffing it off, but to no avail.
If anybody has any thoughts on how to get is of I'd be delighted.
