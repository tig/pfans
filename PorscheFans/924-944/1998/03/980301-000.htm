Ok Pfans, what did I do to it now.....

Every now and then, (I use those words often, don't I?), when I come to
a stop in traffic and let the car idle for a few seconds, a loud creak
that sounds like "errrp" comes from the front left part of the car. Upon
driving forward, another creak will be heard. I've fiddled with,
rattled, and banged on EVERYTHING around there, and I don't know what it
is. Ideas?

Also, to Mr. Matthew Kramer, on his wave theory, I must apologize on
behalf of Santa Barbara Porsche drivers. I have found the same lack of
waving, even to a 944 of identical vintage and color. I do however offer
my ironclad guarantee that if you wave at a 1984 944, grey colored, and
I happen to be driving it and notice you, I will wave back. The weather
was great today, wasn't it?

As for cup holders, I have a $1.99 special from Pep Boys that has a
rubber flap that slides inbetween the window glass and trim panel, and a
small platform/arms that hold a cup/can/etc. Works great. It did fail
once due to fatigue at the joint between the platform and arm assembly,
and was replaced with a new unit.

Alex.
'84 944.
