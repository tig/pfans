So, do you feel the MAF was worth it?  You got 27 HP for what, $1600?
That seems a bit steep unless the driveability is substantially enhanced.
I know these cars are just begging to be modified, but some times I wonder
why people do it.

   Tom-

It was worth it to me, but I didn't really pay that much for the MFS, plus I'm
getting my
old 2.7 chips back and the $100.00 credit for the K-27 upgrade chip I sent
back to Autothority.  I guess I'm kind of a power junkie.  Some people like
gambling, some do dope, some chase women.  I've always liked powerful motors,
the more the better, I can't get enough.  I'm addicted.  I also like my 944
and will probably spend a lot more money on it before its over.  I don't know
why.  And yes drivability is enhanced if you call more power an enhancement, I
do.
