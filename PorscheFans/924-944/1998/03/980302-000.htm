Hi P-fans!

I'm going to try to give you some information about the
fog light installation in my car which seems to be stock.

> The Porsche tech manual schematics show that there is
> a switch on the dash next to the fog-head-lights for
> the rear fog-brake-light.

Yes, there are two switches in my car.
But it is only called rear fog light, it is not connected
in any way with braking lights. Simply a light to switch
on and off. Bulb is 21W, the same type like the braking
lights.

> don't know for sure.

In my car (german version) it is in the top inner position
of the taillight assembly. No external housing.

Yes. But in some country there are/were only one rear fog
light allowed. This law was changed some time ago in ger-
many, newer cars have two rear fog lights. I don't know
if this was the case for 944s.

Yes, mine has. I can send a scan of the picture of my
owners manual. It looks exactly like in my car if any-
body is interested.
But the switches are not totally independent. The rear
fog light is only working if the front fog lights are
also turned on. Owners manual says so and reality shows
the same. The wiring scheme of Haynes shows why, the 
rear fog light switch gets its power from the front fog
light relay.

I do not know what an extra driving light is, but if it
is high beam this switch is connected to the turn signal
lever, push the lever and there is light :-).

Can't help you with this one, I don't have side marker
lights.

If there is anything specific I should check on my car
feel free to drop me a note.
