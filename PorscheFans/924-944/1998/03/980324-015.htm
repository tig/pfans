Hi Tom,

I hate to rain on your parade, but this is simply not acceptable! If
they cannot get enough instructors to deal with everybody in one run
group, they either have to limit the number of students or they have to
divide the people into two groups.

The fact that you were allowed on the track by yourself the very first
time out and the fact that you were signed off on your very first day
tells me there is something very wrong with this picture. Believe me
when I tell you that this is an exception not the rule as to how DE is
supposed to be run.

Based upon what you have said, I would seriously reconsider doing DE
with this region. Perhaps the BMWCCA has a program in your area that is
safe.

Regards,

Paul Foster
