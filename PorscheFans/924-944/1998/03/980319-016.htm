    All this dyno talk still leaves me with a few important questions:

1- At less than a 100% duty cycle how much power can a 951 make with the
stock (370cc?) injectors??.  Steve R  has stated that the stock injestors
are at 100% at 1bar.  Injector upgrading is a huge market for domestic and
Japanese cars ,but Porsche people seem to believe that their injectors are
capable of anything.

2-Will a slightly larger (400"ish" cc) still work and be drivable with the
stock computer??.

3-Does anyone on the "list" have a  Garrett/Miledge turbo??.

4- I don't think the MAF vs. stock air flow meter will ever be solved.
Randall's new dyno numbers do show some promise ,but others including Master
Miledge still swear that they don't make power on anything less than a full
on 2.8 400hp beast. Who the hell knows?.

  Sorry for all the questions ,but until there are some proven modifications
that more than one person can agree on I'm not willing to spend my money on
more than the usual  chips/cat by-pass/K&N.

Happy power hunting
Rob
