The switch is available from Vertex in Miami cheaper than $90, I believe.
The procedure on my 87 944S requires that you have some soldering ability,
and that you own a "desoldering tool." I bought the $8 Radio Shack item
which has worked just fine.

	The procedure, roughly, is as follows;

	1. Remove the two round knobs and the two slider knobs
	2. Remove the nut on the shaft for the temp control knob (long nose
plliers)
	3. Remove the four phillips head screws
	4. Remove the faceplate
	5. Wiggle the climate control unit out enough to gain access to the back
and pry off the three connectors
	6. The unit itself must be separated. You can see where the tabs fit in and
must be pushed out. I broke a couple which seems not to have made a problem.
If you're gentler than I am am you should be able to slowly pry the front
and back of the unit apart.
	7. On mine, some of the seven (I think) connections to the snowflake switch
were buried under a gum-like material which I removed and inexpertly
reapplied later (again, without noticeable problem after two years).
	8. The seven, or however many, connections to the switch must be desoldered
(I had practiced with the tool on a stereo tuner that hadn't worked in
years, and found it to be a very easy, and satisfying, process).
	9. After desoldering, the switch can be pried out of the unit, and the new
switch pushed into place.  Re-solder the connections - re-apply the gum like
substance (if you have it).
	10. Reverse procedures to re-install
