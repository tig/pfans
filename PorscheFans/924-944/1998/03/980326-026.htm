Maybe this is just a silly question on long thread, but, aren't you
supposed to use a pyrometer to measure tire temperature when the car comes
off the track then adjust the pressures to get an even distribution across
the tire?  When I go through this drill I start with a base pressure (35
front/30 read) and adjust the tire by 2 lb increments until temperature
readings are linear.  Some of the data sheets I've seen have a place to
record date, time of day, outside temperature, surface temperature,
sunny/cloudy, etc.  I think the readings can also tell you something about
alignment for that particular tire (maybe an alignment with Hoosiers would
be different then one with BFG).  Just a thought.....
