Mike,
     If your motor isn't working at all, I would first try to jumper the
micro-switch at the sun visor. Even if it appears to be working properly,
they are very strange and are normally the problem when the motor doesn't
run at all.
    There is a relay in the fuse box as well as fuses. I don't recall
personally but, the shop manual says there are three fuses (#8, #18, and
#36).  I can't tell you how to check the relay but, I have had one go bad
(Not very common).
    In Febraury 1986 Porsche started putting a different style lifting
mechanism in the cars. However, I believe the 85.5 has the same console
switch arrangement and should show the same voltages. With the ignition key
in position 2, Terminal 1 on the console switch should have battery
voltage. With the ignition key in position 1, Terminal 2 should have
battery voltage. When the car is running at greater than 1 mile per hour,
Teminal 5 should have battery voltage. Hope this helps you find the
problem.

Good Luck,
Clark Fletcher
