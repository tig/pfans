Rich,
     I am certainly glad things worked out for you. There was an earlier post 
as well from someone who bought a door handle from sv056, he was satisfied 
with the handle, just had a hard time getting it sent from sv056. I will 
re-post again once my matters are settled with sv056. The intent of my 
original post was not to scare people from purchasing items from sv056, but to 
enter into such transactions with some caution. Perhaps my experience was 
isolated, perhaps my small purchase didn't receive much of sv056's 
attention,...

Thanks,
       Ezra
