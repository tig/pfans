Hello Derek& Pfans
	One thing to keep in mind is that detonation begines to occur in the
inaudable spectrum to the human ear! By the time your ear can hear the ping,
it's really too late. Detonation is occuring at/by that time. In my case, I
have found that it is really hard to hear ping at least for my 944 Turbo. I
use Sunocco 94 octane and run 19 psi (when it's less than 40'F) w/APE V2.7
chips and a 1.85 jet/banjo bolt. 
	There are a couple of things that can cause detonation. 1)Too low of an fuel
octane. 2)Too much static cylinder compression (like your milled head/block!
have you looked up the min cylinder head thickness?). 3)Too much ignition
advancement (is your ignition rotor set screw tight? How about you inductive
pickup sensor, is the bolt tight and clean electrical connections?). 4)ambient
temp too hot lowering the fuels effective octane. This has happened to me this
last summer on a 97'F day, the KLR set max boost to 1.3 bar untill i restarted
the engine. Maybe your intercooler is not clear or clogged? 5)Oil fumes/vapors
blow-by getting into the combustion chanber lowering the effective octane.
This happens to 928 motors at sustained high rpms. The oil froth gets blown
into the cubstion chamber and them detonation occurs. 
	
	Well thats my two cents worth! 

Good Luck
