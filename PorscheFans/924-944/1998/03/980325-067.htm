A bad one:

Torn boot, little grease in the joint. The balls will be pitted and worn
instead of nice and round and smooth.  The center section of the joint
(part on the half-shaft) will be gouged where the balls have worn. The
outer section (part on the flange) will have similar wear marks. The races
will be worn or in extreme cases broken.

A good one:

Boot intack. Still full of grease. Balls shiny and smooth. Inner and outer
sections are maybe a little shiny where the balls have worn but not gouged.
Races have no cracks or wear marks.

Can't think of anything else to service there but it might be a good time
to change the transaxle fluid since you will already be covered with grease.
