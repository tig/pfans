Joseph,

I drive my 924 almost everyday for work and social reasons. I have taken my
car through nasty traffic jams in hot afternoons and through the breezy
city highways. I think you shouldn't worry about reliability and breakdowns
from regular use. In fact, my car tends to give problems when I don't drive
it after a long vacation! Maybe it gave me problems because I didn't pay
enough attention to it!

Anyway, you are going to miss a lot if you don't drive that car regularly.
Why buy a Porsche and put it in a garage when a car like that was meant to
fly with the wind?

How about driving each car on alternate days?
