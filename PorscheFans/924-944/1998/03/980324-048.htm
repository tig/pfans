I disagree with quite a bit of what Davidjalai wrote.

First, I would try to separate in my mind the practices of someone who=20
does normal service and repair, from those of someone who builds race=20
cars.  Yes, someone who does service and repair generally has nothing=20
to hide in terms of sources, techniques, and the like.  But that's not=20
always the case, even there.  If there is a way to do a particular job=20
that saves a couple hours, or a source for parts at half the cost, it=20
is not likely that even a service and repair place will always share=20
that.  It's part of their competitive edge.

But when you talk about building race engines, which is what Jon=20
Milledge does, if you believe he and his brethren ought to share with=20
you all their techniques and tricks, you're dreaming.  Like a lot of us=20
on the list, they make their money trading in intellectual property,=20
and they've paid for that in (very expensive) blown engines, lost=20
races, and of course long hours.

Bruce may have written what he did in his book, but he's not so na=EFve=20
as to believe it 100%.  Ask him about exploding dilivar studs,=20
premature 3.2 Carrera valve guide wear, exploding SC clutches, etc.,=20
all very OE.
