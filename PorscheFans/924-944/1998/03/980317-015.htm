As you may notice second test was done at .1 bar boost more.  I don't
have my controllable boost installed yet.  Test also done in third gear.

I did run another in 4th but the 3rd gear numbers were better and the
first test was done in 3rd gear.  As you may notice something is causing

my power to fall off early, at 6000 RPM I'm almost back to same as first
test.  I may try the rising rate fuel pressure regulator and see if it
helps,
but I think it is probably chips which is a hard fix.  These numbers
don't tell everything, the MFS was worth getting with my setup but I
believe
unless the rest of your motor is flowing very well it may not be.  I am
disappointed in my power at high RPM(I like to feel power keep building
until close to redline) and will be looking for a fix to this.  I am
open to suggestions.
