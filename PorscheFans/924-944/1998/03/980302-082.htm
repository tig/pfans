BOY, the world sure needs more people like you.  In this world of "what's in
it for me?" and "hurray for me and the he__ with you," your post was surely
refreshing.  May God bless you for your kind jesture.

Please forgive me for posting your reply to me back on to the list.  I hope it
is OK with you.  I don't mean to embarass you and I hope it doesn't cause you
too much "new trafficking" of your tension tool.  I just want others on this
list to know about the Quality people who play here.

 Thanks.
I figure with all the advice that gets thrown back and forth, a little tool
sharing 
couldn't hurt.  Especially when a tool becomes an inve$tment:-)
with the cost of some of the parts the tension tool might be off the budget
for
some
of the Pcar drivers on the list.

And it worked, Ive already agreed to send it to Hawaii closer to the end of
the
year.
  Of couse it was in trade for Surfing lessons If I ever get down that way,
but
I dont
see that happening for a while.

I'd be more than happy to put a pict of your 944S on my page when its done, if
you don't
already have it up on one.

Talk to ya later.
