Get a 951, a 944S2 or a 968. Why mess up a beautiful 1986 944 that has been
so well maintained? Keep it and get a second car. The cost of a good 951 or
a so-so S2 or 951S will be about the same as transforming your present car.
 Or trade in your present car and save money. Funny, but in all cases, I
too was once advised to trade in a late '85 instead of modifying it. Maybe
it's good advice.
