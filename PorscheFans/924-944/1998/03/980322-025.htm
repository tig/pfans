I would.  It's not going to do you any good to leave it alone, and it 
could certainly cause a problem.

Ditto.

Why are you going to replace the water pump - is there a problem with 
it?  If not, leave it alone and be happy you've got a good one!  It 
sounds to me like you're doing the right thing, by having someone look 
periodically at your car for problems and problems-to-be.  Just keep 
doing that, and fixing the little ones before they get big.  Cheers,

Kevin
