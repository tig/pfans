Other bad things to say ( my own personal experience here )

Officer : This bike ( I was riding a friends freshly tuned 2 stroke race
bike ) has 2 bald tires, no registration, no warrant of fitness, and you
have no license for this type of vehicle ( the bike ) .
Me : I thought I was going too fast for you to notice all that officer.

Somehow buy an act of God I got away with this .

Officer : Do you know how fast you were going sir?
Me : You tell me, you were trying to keep up

This went down reasonably well as the cop was under 25 ( he hadn't lost
his sense of humor yet ) and he only ticket me for 150 KPH.

I have since learned to behave, a little, in traffic.
