Hi, JP and everyone else,

Yeah, I guess you're right.  Mr. Livingston's post really struck a nerve
with me and I should have waited until I had calmed down to reply or,
better yet, not reply at all.  I apologize to Mr. Livingston and the
rest of the list for my rude remark and I'll try to do better in the
future.

Mike Fields
