Last month I ordered merchandise from Tweeks...was told it was in stock
and was promised it would be @ the shop in 3 days...when it didn't
arrive on Wednesday I called and spoke w/ David (explaining that I'm 
racing on Sat.)

Not only was he apologetic...he sent it out overnight AND gave me 20%
discount for their mistake.  Price competiveness usually is effected
by the business's overhead, however, I find in hard to imagine that
ANY company today believes being rude/vulgar is the way to go?

I have also (like many?) needed technical advice at times and found
John to be both patient and genuinely concerned.

Suffice to say...we all error at times...sometimes giving the other
party a chance to correct their mistake can mean the difference between
misunderstanding and satisfaction?
