    Yes the window has to come out, sorry. Usually the interior panel has
enough extra material to go over the steel lip in the jamb and i sure that
it would look like you pryed it back in if you don't remove the window. I've
been told since yesterday that the grill is not removeable. The window comes
out fairly easy. Remove the metal trim from the outside groove and then some
gentle pushing will pop the rubber lip over the jamb. It is a good idea to
have someone on the outside to catch if it flies out. Putting it back is a
little harder. Once the panel is back in place  you can secure the material
back to the jamb with some trim adhesive. Be sure to let it cure fully
before continuing.  Then buy some nylon rope ( about 5/32, the hollow kind
is best ). You wrap the rope around the window seal in the groove and place
the window in the hole. have someone on the outside applying gentle
pressure. From the inside pull one end of the rope to pull the lip of the
seal back over the jamb. This will reseat the seal all of the way aroud. It
is a bit of a challange and will probably take a few tries to get it right.
Some slippery upolstry protectant like armor-all will allow it to go in a
little more smoothly but is messy and will make the upolstry a little harder
to reglue if by chance you pull it loose on your first couple of tries. Feel
free to post or mail me if you have any questions. As you can tell i have
fought this type of project more than once. Good luck
bye for now, Todd
