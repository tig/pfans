It isn't generally the lowering that makes the ride unpleasant, it is the
higher-rate springs and torsion bars that you'll need to safely lower the
car and keep the shocks and struts in more-or-less their designed range of
operation.

You definitely don't want to put shorter, higher-rate springs on front and
simply re-index the torsion bars because you'll ruin the balance of the
car. Also lowering is not a good thing for increasing the reliability of
the ball joints and control arms. This is documented fact.

But if you decide to do it I think you'll find that the springs and torsion
bars will degrade the ride over sharp bumps at highway speeds like from
expansion joints.

The larger anti-roll bars will degrade the ride more over uneven, low speed
bumps like you might find in parking lots, poor streets, etc. This is because
large bars tend to make the independent suspension less so.

Lots of people have setups similar to the one I have with 28mm T bars, 250#
springs and the larger anti-roll bars and lowered to the point that the car
has to be and driven up on 2x12 blocks before even the small shop jack will
fit under the rocker panels. And they are fun on the street and track. But
your SO probably isn't going to like riding in it and you are going to have
to exercise real caution when negotiating speed bumps, parking lot
entrances, etc., to keep from scraping something. Just trade offs in the
end.
