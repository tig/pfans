> Question for you all,,,,, is CASIS on the 951's also or just on the 944???

The early 944 ('83-'85) had two gauges/display features that were
removed from the '85.5 944 and up, including the 951. The first was the
shift indicator (CASIS) and the second was the MPG(Gal/hour) gauge. Both
are fairly sophisticated, they use the fuel injection pulse width,
throttle position, coolant temp and the hall sensor outputs among other
parameters used to calculate display. While it is hardly practical or
necessary to look for an orange arrow in the dash every time I want to
shift, both the CASIS indicator and the MPG gauge are extremely useful
as indicators of load on the engine.

The MPG gauge first clued me in when the temp sensor and the Oxygen
sensor on my '84 944 started dying (at different times). I caught both
before any catastrophic failures, simply by observing the delivery of
fuel at different temperatures and load. I find the CASIS indicator
useful for knowing when the motor is operating at normal loads. As you
know oil takes about twice the time it takes for coolant to reach
operating temps. One way to know when your motor is warmed up and safe
for normal RPMs is to wait for oil pressure at idle to drop under 3bar,
or double the time it took your coolant temp. to reach normal. If you
use 20W50 oil and drive in 10F weather all winter you know how long this
can take. The CASIS indicator conveys the same information by indicating
graduated RPMs as recommended shift points, depending on engine load and
throttle position. I miss these two gauges in my S2.
