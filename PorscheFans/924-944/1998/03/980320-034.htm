I'm about to take the plunge after a life of driving pretenders.  The
problem is I'm somewhat confused and I need to narrow my search down to
specific models and years.  Can anybody help me sort out which years and
models of 944's are most desirable and which ones to avoid.  I think I'm
looking for something like an '87 944S but I don't know if the few extra
bucks for a good "S" model are worth it.  Is the 16 valve engine a better
power plant or what?  I'm probably not interested in a turbo so looking at
only 944S's is kind of limiting (fewer of them, fewer years in production,
etc.) so do I need to consider regular 944's or stick to the "S" model. 
When looking at non "S" models that obviously opens up the year question
quite a bit.  Which are the cherries and which are road kill - or does it
even matter?
