Ole:
I spent time in Sweden in the 70's, and couldn't help but see the
difference you mentioned in your post.   Scandanavia (Europe in general)
definitely produces a different attitude about drinking, social impact
of drinking, and driving.

Teenagers in your land have access to alcohol (can buy alcohol at 14 or
15)  much before they get their driving permits (at around 18).   It's
seen as a passage that these future drivers already get out of their
system what alcohol can do and the novelty of drinking is gone before
they get behind the wheel of a car.   Most people just accept younger
drinkers, and place a much more responsible approach to driving.   I was
19 when in Sweden, and it was completely normal that someone would
remain sober if driving was involved.

Here in the US, teenagers learn to drive just about the same time they
get access to alcohol.  In fact, driving gives them the opportunity to
experiment with alcohol because they are with friends and away from
parents.   It struck me way back then that we in the US have it all
backwards!   However, it's evolved this way over the decades, and is now
a part of our social fabric.   I feel now as I did then that you folks
are way ahead of us in teaching responsibility.

Of course, this is opinion..........................
