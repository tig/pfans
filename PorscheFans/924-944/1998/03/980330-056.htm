Subject: Plug Wires

Well, looks like I'm in need of a new set of ignition wires for my '87
944S. Have been shopping around and have been quoted prices ranging from
$150 to $220 for OEM or Bosch.
So I see that Manecor lists a set for the 944 but not specifically the
944S, I sent out some e-mail and asked. In the reply was this - 
" We have a set for this, our wires use spark plug boots that are quite
different
to the originals (they look odd, but they work fine) "
Which leads me to this, has anyone used a set of Magnecor wires for the
944S and do they work "just fine?"
Considering they are at least $40 less expensive if they work it looks
like
the way to go.

TIA

I bought a set of Magnecor's for my '89 Turbo, they fit beautifully.
They appear to be of a higher quality material than the OE wires. For
$69(from Windward) they're a steal. Just my $0.02.
