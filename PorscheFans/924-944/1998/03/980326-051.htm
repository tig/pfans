>Now here is mine Torque Master or Bosh plugs

PLUGS: Bosch or NGK.  I prefer NGK because I know a R&D engineer there and he
provided excellent info.  I use BPR7ES which is one range colder than
stock.  The Bosch platinums have been problematic on every car I've owned.
My dealer prefers the regular Bosch plugs to NGK.

MILLEDGE: About Milledge, I've tried to talk to this man.  I've had money in
hand ready to purchase products and he's never had the time of day to talk
to me.  I like to be fairly technical, so it's not like I called him
and said, "I want a 600hp 944T that has stock reliability".  He sounded
drunk the day I called him, but he may have just been having a bad day.
In talking with many people, his name does come up a lot so I have no
doubt that he is good, but reality says, the 944T has an engine, lots
of cars have engines and lots of people can make an engine fast, so I'm
sure that there are lots of guys out there that one can go to to make
their 944T fast.

BUSCHUR: What David Buschur does of Buschur Racing is to have a competitive
policy. He will give out any information about his secrets as long as it's
two steps back.  For example, let's say he develops a new turbo that works
really well, then develops a new manifold design.  He will run those and
his little group (which included me) get to use these parts.  Now, let's
say he develops a new wastegate that works really well and picks up 
a bunch more power, he will then release the first of the three items to
the public.  So, we would tell all about the turbo.  Once
he develops another product, he will talk about the manifold design.

This keeps him innovative and always looking for new things to explore.
It also allows him to keep his competitive advantage in the market place
and at the drag strip or road track.

CHIPS: As far as the Milledge chips producing more power, etc.  Boost is
power. If the Milledge chips use even 1psi more boost, then it will create
more power.  To properly compare chips, the same method of boost control as
well as the same pressure must be utilized.  I'm not saying they don't
work, I have not tested them (read the above about trying to buy a set
of chips), but once again, it's hard to compare chips unless they are on
the same car with the same boost control method.  Look at the vast difference
in power and torque curves in my dyno test when we went with the drilled
valve over the bolt method.

RANDALL, the Greddy Profec has some very specific and very unique methods
to set the unit up for its fuzzy logic circuit to work.  You must do the
3rd and 4th gear pulls which can be very dangerous on the street.  Japanese
car tuner friends say that if you just drive the car for a few days and do
some occasional WOT runs, the unit will work correctly if you don't have
the chance to do the programming the normal way.  If you want more details,
I can forward you a note about the Greddy units from a friend of mine.

HEAD GASKET: Last item is, what signs lead to a head gasket failure.  I'm
trying to help a friend figure out a problem and everything sort of leads to
a head gasket going bad, but I wanted an idea of what signs appear before they
go on a 951.

Thanks,
Farzaan.
