there is a certain amount of lowering that is possible HOWEVER it is a real
number not a guess...something like 13" from the middle of the wheel to the
bottom of the wheel arch...this is because of the stress placed on the
Control Arms, it will cause them to crack and it is not "if" but rather
"when"  and when it does i hope you are not the car next to me....the rear
can be lowered by turning the eccentric bolt on the rear suspension, but i
think it will only lower about 1.5 inch if i remember correctly...in
general the rear is just a little to high and the front height can be
adjusted using lowering spring with a stiffer spring rate...
