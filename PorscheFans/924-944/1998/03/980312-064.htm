....02 seems to be the successor of ...01
Maybe that's the reason because part ...02 is shown in the catalog.

I don't know AZEV wheels but the "official" Porsche offsets for your rims
are 52mm front and 68mm rear.

My rims have the offset printed on their inside.

Hmmm... just buying new tires cause you are unsure if it's legal?
Go and have a Porsche mechanic look at the parts.
The 2 rubber bearings and 2 excenter bolts are 306 DM (~170 US$)
