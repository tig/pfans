     I've been travelling for the last three weeks on business and am just 
     now reading all of February's PF mail..  I saw a deciphering of 1984 
     model paint codes and was wondering if anyone has a similar list for 
     1986 951's. 
     
     Also had a not so great experience this past weekend -  the first time 
     I have been able to drive my 951 since mid December - due to a broken 
     right leg.  I finally had the cast removed and, against my doctor's 
     recommendation, I stopped wearing the air boot which completely 
     immobilized my leg preventing me from driving. I now wear a stirrup 
     suppport which allows me to walk rather normally and - more 
     importantly - gives me the mobility I need to drive.  Anyway, I took 
     the car over to a car wash where they hand wash the car, using a water 
     spray booth ( with in floor car pusher) to clean off the hand applied 
     soap and optionally - which I optioned for - spary a wax on the car.  
     Well, after the car exited the water/wax booth, it sat for about 5 
     minutes before the car was hand dried.  Evidently, during this short 
     waiting period, the wax was tacky and airborn dust migrated to the car 
     surfaces and nicely and evenly coated the car with a wax impregnated 
     dust coat.  Now the finish, which used to be very silky, feels like 
     sandpaper.  Hopefully, the wax is water soluble so I can take it to a 
     do-it-yourself - car wash, remove the wax/dust coating, and end up 
     with a finish that is like it was before this _25.00 fiasco.  I 
     haven't had time to go back to the detail shop, but i will eventually. 
     The big question is - if the rewash does not remove the wax, what are 
     my options? Is there a wax remover available besides Zymol Clear Auto 
     Bath @ _23.98 for 8 ounces?
     
     I still am pondering the desire to "chip" my car.  My concerns are 
     that if chipping really does add to the HP and torque output of the 
     engine is the rest of the drive train strong enough to handle the 
     increase in stress it will see.  What other options are available. My 
     car is an '86 951 and is somewhat sluggish off the line, at least 
     until the turbo/engine RPM spool up. I am looking to improve the low 
     end performance.
     
     One last question - I would like to purchase a bra to protect the 
     fromt end paint but am concerned about the damage the bra could cause 
     by virbating and rubbing that oould occur while the car is in motion.  
     Am I out in left field on this one?
