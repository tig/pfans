Indeed, 0W-30 did not exist then, thus Porsche may issue an addendum
approving use of 0W-30.  Also, Vancouver, Canada is different than St.
Louis, MO where we get upwards of 90F in the summer quite often.  That is
why I qualified my statement with the 15W-50 part.  

In St. Louis every shop and dealer in town told me if I was going to
autocross my 944 or drive it with spirit, I should run 15W-50 and given it
is an 87 to overfill it by half a quart.  I hardly put any miles on the
car to warrant more than an annual oil change and I autocross whenever I
get an opportunity, thus I cannot see using 0W-30.  YMMV in Vancouver or
any place that is significantly colder than the 90 F- 100 F we experience
in the summer.
