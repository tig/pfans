I own a 1986 944 that only has 28K original miles.  I am the original owner
and I've cared for this car better than I have myself.  My problem is this:
I WANT MORE-GET-UP-AND-GO-POWER!    I installed a chip for extra ponies....
big deal!  I've been told by several shops that I can install an S2 motor
with "a liitle modification" or a  968 3.0L with a "little more
modification."  I was also told that the turbo motor would  require too
much modification.  In all cases I was advised that I would probably be
better off to sell my 944 and then buy a "good condition" PO 944T or 968.
After reviewing many of the the previous daily messages I'm confused about
what will fit and what can me made to fit and for approximately how much.
I'd rather not part with my current "in perfect condition" 944, but "I feel
the need for speed!"   Help!  What can I do?
