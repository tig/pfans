Ugh. I can't stay away.... I'm drawn into the vortex....

Ok, whoah here. First of all, I will state I have never been to your
region's DEW (driver education weekend). I have no idea if the event was
safe or not, or  of what quality was your education. Why? Because I wasn't
there. I think people are making the way-too-common mistake of criticising
technique.

There is absolutely nothing unsafe about the follow-the-leader mode of
instruction. Most professional schools use it. Is it as good as single
instruction? Well, I would argue it depends on the instructor and the
school. If the instructors know how to control follow-the-leader, it can
work. If they don't, big disaster on the horizon.

Similarly, most professional schools also put the students in cars without
instructors right away. How can they do this and avoid carnage? Command and
control, plain and simple. 

So, imho, if your instructor was good (and this is obviously hard for you
to evaluate, or ANY of us to evaluate unless we were there), and knew how
to work the system, then I don't think you had less-than-optimum
instruction. Also, your instructor evaluated you, decided you were safe on
your own, and let you go. Your instructor was correct, you survived. I
don't think it is fair for any of us to comment on your instructor's
abilities. (Certainly, there is no way in hell I could instruct an average
person well enough in 16 laps to be on their own. Perhaps you're not
average? Who can say - we weren't there.)

HOWEVER, I think many of us reading your post had warning gongs going off,
I know I did. Reason? I'm using professional schools as an example. There
is a world of difference between a professional school and a bunch of
region volunteers. Obviously the level of teaching (and overall
organization) suffers. More importantly, the variance between instructors
is extreme. This is a long-standing issue in PCA, and a very thorny one as
far as liability is concerned.

So, enough from me about instruction. 

There are lots of other issues, though. In my experience, there are two
kinds of driver's schools, and they differ primarily in philosophy. At the
risk of offending everyone, I'll label them the "intimidation" school and
the "safety nazi" school.

In the intimidation school, there is this underlying element of
macho-survival-of-the-fittest. Characteristics of this school include
relatively few returnees, students exhibiting exhileration at "surviving"
the school, many students hiding vague feelings of intimidation, and a
number of spins, organizational delays, and at least one car with bent
sheet metal every weekend. Those students strong enough to survive come
back and overcome. There is a lot of talk about safety, but everyone knows
the real reason for being there is going fast. Instruction is centered upon
this mythical "line." Timing is underground, but widespread.

In the safety nazi school, the whole concept of the track as a race track
is thrown out. The track is merely a closed road for learning how to drive
smoothly. The "line" is of secondary importance. Speed is irrelevant. The
course of instruction is designed to put students at ease and comfortable
with their car. Many return as a result. The rate of progression (relative
to lap times) is much MUCH slower. Every spin is "discussed" at great
length, every "incident" results in a fear-of-god driver's meeting, the
flaggers have black flags and use them. Aggressiveness is actively
discouraged. Timing is actively pursued. (Ack! Its the stopwatch police!)

In the 10 <gasp> years my region (Rennsport) has slowly evolved from the
former to the latter. I think that is the trend, driven by liability and
insurance concerns if nothing else. Which is better? Well, I must admit a
certain nostalgia for the old days and find the new rules (and there are a
lot more) quite constrictive. However, I can't argue with the facts that
there are now many more local region drivers involved, more people return
to our events, some making annual pilgrimages over distances I can't
comprehend. Perhaps the most telling difference: In the old days, bent
sheet-metal was expected every weekend and we used to plan for it. Under
the new kinder, gentler regime, we went three years without incident.

Just my 0.02c.

>What I'd like to know is:
>1)  What constitutes a good DE event in your PCA region?

For me? Not spinning #2 rod bearing. <cough>.

Seriously? Every body and every car leaving the event just as they came -
no injuries, no bent metal. An event that people come back too.

>2)  Should all regions adopt uniform rules or should they be based on the
>difficulty of the track in question and the success rate attributed to the
>program?

I don't think rules will help. Rules don't change attitude; they don't
elminate poor planning and organization.

>3)  How are the DE events normally organized?  Novices only that day, or
>intermixed with faster run groups to spread out the cost?

I know all novices would love to have a day by themselves. Track time
passes much faster for novices than others (One's perceptions are based on
number of laps completed.) However, intermixed is the rule of the day to
pay for things. As a supporting point, much can be learned from watching
others.

>4)  What are some of the special rules that (should) pertain to novice
>drivers and how long should they apply?

None. I don't believe in rpm or speed restrictions. I believe it is up to
the instructor and organizers to create and promote an environment of
safety. If a student is "wild," then it is up to the instructor to tame the
student (or change instructors).

>5)  What typical criteria is used for advancement to "faster" run groups.

Experience and ability. I've seen scorecards tried with some success. Now
that databases are available everywhere, there is no excuse for a region
not to build up a database of student and teacher evaluations.

>6)  Anything else you feel is important.

Instructors NEED teaching too! Every region should hold instructor days to:
	- decide on a common curriculum.
	- teach instructors how to teach adults (they may know how to drive, but...)
	- improve *their* skills 

In closing, Tom, I think you had a good experience, but a lucky one, and
one that is not that uncommon. You survived; you succeeded; and you will
progress. Have a look around at next year's season opener and see how many
of your fellow students came back, though.
