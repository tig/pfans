Mark:

I have not done any extrude honing on my motor yet but I believe
Randall Morton (waxking1@mail2.theonramp.net) has done his head and
intake manifold.

As respects pricing, please see the excerpt below from the Powerhaus
website:

==================================================
When as much air flow restriction has been removed from the engine
(i.e. free flow exhaust, Mass Flow Sensor), and greater air flow
demands are put on the motor (K-27 turbo), then the next areas of
improvement are the cylinder head and intake manifold. PowerHaus
stocks fully prepared cylinder heads and intake manifolds. Heads are
ported & polished to increase flow, and surfaced and o-ringed to
further decrease the chance of head gasket failure or leaks (tested at
1.25 bar boost). PowerHaus also performs special machining to help
reduce turbo lag, and increase off-boost throttle response. Our
manifolds are extrude honed to make the intake runners glass smooth.
The internal diameter of the runners is also increased, and finally
port-matched to the PowerHaus-prepared cylinder head. 

Done together, these improvements mean an additional 37 dyno proven
horsepower, with huge gains in driveability and throttle response! 

Cylinder Head: $750.00 / Exchange
Intake Manifold: $600.00 / Exchange 

(Manifolds are in stock to save you the 8-10 week wait of sending
yours to Extrude Hone.) 
==================================================

In addition, I friend of mine who has a Stillen 300ZX Twin Turbo
extrude honed his head, intake manifold and both turbos.  He claimed
that driveability was indeed better and that turbo lag was further
reduced.
