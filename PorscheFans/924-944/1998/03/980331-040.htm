My '84 944 had a leak in an a/c hose from the dryer to the condensor
(the one closes to the intake manifold, going in to the firewall). It
was diagnosed by evacuating the remaining freon, and pumping up with an
inert gas that could be electronically sniffed, I think it was a
Nitrogen compound. After the bad hose was located I decided to wait on
replacing it until this year since it was close to winter. The system
was left marginally charged (2 lbs) with the inert gas, to avoid getting
air and moisture in the system. 

But both when it had hardly any freon in the system, and now with a
couple of pounds of a gas in the system, the a/c compressor starts right
up and tries to cool. Is the low pressure switch supposed to cut power
to the clutch?
