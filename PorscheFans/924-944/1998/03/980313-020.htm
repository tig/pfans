Farzaan responds:

<<<<Just a reminder to PCA racers.  If you make changes like the above,
you
may be moved out of stock class and be moved into something you are not
competitive at.  Since Tom hasn't shown up twice when I've driven 300
miles to see him race, I don't think this message affects him :)  Just 
joking Tom, I know, you had the flu :)>>>>

Farzaan makes a good point that racers and autocrossers need to know the
preparation rules since adding such an item to a 951 that runs in SCCA
AS may be illegal. Since this part is an upgrade, it would be legal if
the original part is not available anymore. But you are getting into a
very grey area of the rules. Using Turbo motor mounts on a NA 944 is
also illegal since the original parts are still available. However, the
original subject was about putting 17" wheels on a 951 - that alone
would move you into ASP where bushings are free. 

Tom, thanks for clearing this up. I had heard rumors of this expensive
part, but I had no luck finding it. Does anybody knwo the difference
between the 951.341.023.01 part and the 951.341.023.30 part (besides the
price :-))?
