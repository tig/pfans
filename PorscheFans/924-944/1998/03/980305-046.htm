You know........I don't think the 944 engine, normally aspirated or
turbo, would accept carbs of any sort too well. If Porsche could have
escaped the woes of erratic idling or detonation, knocking or pinging by
the engine utilizing such a high compression, they would have done so on
ROW cars due to lack of strict exhaust emissions. BUT, since the engine
was built w/ such rigid specs and close tolerances, the DME systems
allow controlling the ignition timing, fuelling mixture for as near
perfect stochoic ratio and other close tolerance variables that allowed
this high performance engine to exist and operate as an everyday driver
and get such great mileage and performance out of a "four-banger". (was
that last sentence a run-on? My high school teacher would have strung me
up on the flag pole for such poor grammar and spelling) Anyway Daniel,
to make a long story short, I'd suggest to not mess w/ a good thing. If
it ain't broke, don't f_ck w/ it.


Hey Lee, try this line:
"Oh woes me, woes me......always getting the shaft, never the elevator!"
We used to say this on my last ship whenever our deployment got extended
for changed operational commitments.
