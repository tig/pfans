Hehehe, let me tell you a story.  I broke my sunroof gears by taking out
the sunroof, sort of.  I had retracted the latches and raised the rear of
the roof but did not take it out completely. Then I did something really
stupid, I started the car and moved it.  Well, do you know that the 944
does when you let the clutch out and the latches are retracted?  You are
right, it tries to engage them so the roof does not fly off. 

And who said the roof was level at that point?  One latch engaged before
the other one.  I raised the roof to see what was going on. I noticed it
was not level, but it did not register right away.  Then I lowered it so I
could retract the latches again and take the sunroof out.  Guess what, one
latch retracted fully before the other one, CRUNCH!  At least it was a
cheap mistake to recover from.  The plastic in the broken gears did not
look aged, so I cannot say age was a factor. 

So I think that one answer to your question lies there. The gears can take
the strain when _both_ are taking the load from the (slipping) clutch,
IMHO. When only one takes the load, it is liable to have its teeth
stripped.
