Hi,

My son Scott and I completed our first PCA Drivers Ed (DE) event
yesterday.  We arrived at Seattle International Raceway a bit before 7:00
am.  At that time the weather was good...  overcast, calm, and dry.  =
There
was a huge turnout.  Unfortunately, by 8:30 it was raining lightly =
(liquid
sunshine as we call it here).

After registration and tech, we had some free time, so we watched the
first group out, which was the fast GREEN group at 9:00.  Partway through
the session it was red flagged because of an off road excursion by one of
the overly exuberant participants.  Prior to that we saw several cars get
pretty squirrely in the rain coming out of turn 8, which leads onto the
straight.  I should have paid more attention to that...

During the RED group's run all the 1st timers as we were called, had a
chalk talk meeting to go over the procedures and get paired up with our
driving instructor (DI).  There is one DI per two cars.  Our group had a
good assortment of 911s, 993s, Boxsters, 944s (NA and turbo), and 968s.

At 11:00 we headed off for our first run of the day.  The DI drove the =
1st
car of the pair, with the student in the right seat.  I followed in my =
car
and was told to stay close and follow their line.  During the ground
school on Thursday, the chief driving instructor said this first time
would be driven at 35-40 mph.  Ha, what a joke!  We pulled onto the main
straight and were hitting 70-80 right off the bat.  It was FUN!

After two laps, the DI switched places with her student in his '76 911
with modified 3 liter SC engine and he did two laps (yes, I had a female
instructor... I picked her because of her reputation as a good DI... and
she was).  This process was repeated with my S2.  As she drove me around
the course she talked the whole time about hand position on the wheel,
shifting, feet position, braking and most importantly, * following the
correct line! *

I was a bit ragged on my first two laps with the DI, but did OK and she
gave praise when due, and also told me when I goofed up.  It went by =
(too)
quickly.  I got a bit out of sorts coming out of turn 8 and the rear end
started to come around, but I stuck with the throttle and just corrected
with steering and it straightened right out (love that 944).  After lunch
we were up again at 12:50.  Same procedure as last time, but now much
faster!  SIR is a fun, relatively easy course to learn initially, but to
be really good it takes lots and lots or practice.  I was on my street
SP8000s and they did OK, but weren't the best in the wet and the tail =
felt
a bit loose, so I lowered the rear tire pressures a few psi and that
seemed to help.

The 2nd session went well and we had some real excitement too as a 993 =
and
another 944 both spun in front of us coming out of turn 2 (it was pretty
wet by now).  My instructor was relatively aggressive and she had us pass
some of the slower cars down the main straight.  I did well enough in =
this
session that the DI said I could go by myself in session three.  I was
(usually) hitting the apexes within a couple of feet now.

Now, it was really wet with a 70 mph limit on the main and back =
straights.
This in  *no way * hampered the fun as driving down the straight isn't
much of a big deal (except for the last session...), it's the corners =
that
are fun.  I had a really great time and felt I was getting the line down
pretty well...  I knew when I did well, and I knew when I screwed up.  A
968 driver wasn't so lucky... he ended up skidding off turn 2 into the
grass.  I could easily stay with the 911s, other 944s and 968s.  Two
Boxsters were also in our group and for whatever reason, those two cars
were really slow in the corners in the rain.  I have a feeling that the
Boxster's centrally located engine makes it a bit less communicative =
about
what the ends of the car are doing.

Midway through the 3rd session the rain had stopped and the track was
starting to clear a bit.  An hour later we were up again and were
permitted to drive along with the RED group as long as our DI had signed
us off, which she did.

This time, NO SPEED LIMT!  The track was drying out pretty well and I was
hitting 105+ on the main straight right away. I think I might have nudged
close to 115 on one hot lap at I redlined 4th and was into 5th.  Turn 1 =
at
SIR is a dogleg to the right and you just keep your foot planted and =
steer
towards turn 2!  NO lifting, or you end up in the bunker!  This gets
pretty exciting at higher speeds as the road is a bit bumpy and the car
jostles around a little in this stretch... then it's hard on the binders
into turn 2.  During this final session I noticed some big black tires
streaks here.  Someone obviously locked up their brakes.  I got the ABS =
to
come on for an instant on one lap.  It never came on in the rainy
sessions... obviously I was being conservative (there were at least 6
spins in our group).

This session was damn fun and I was having a blast!  Although DE is not
racing (no wheel to wheel, no passing except on main straight, no
following too closely), you could have fooled me :-) as I tried my best =
to
keep up with the normal Red drivers.  The only car that passed me was a
993 and another Carrera.

Some things I learned about driving on the track:

-  Smooth is fast... smooth is fast... smooth is fast.
-  Follow the correct line.
-  "Unwind" the wheel and feed some power after the apex.  Don't do this
and you end up in the weeds like others.
-  I don't need more power yet, just more experience and instruction.
-  If the tail comes out a bit, don't lift, just correct with steering.
-  I can go a LOT faster, but not without practice, practice, practice.

Some things I learned about the S2:

-  It is very capable in stock form, easily the equal of most normal =
911s.
-  The stock shocks aren't the best.  The car felt a bit light at times,
especially coming off the uphill section into a left hand sweeper, or
going into turn 1 at full tilt.
-  The 2nd gear torque out of slower turns is really nice, as is the
linear power delivery.
-  The brakes are excellent.  Admittedly, I didn't really work them very
hard until the final few laps, and even then I could have been much more
aggressive, however, I just wanted to make it through the DE without
incidence and improve gradually.
-  The stock Porsche Textar pads performed well without a hint of fade.

Overall, the day was great fun and I HIGHLY recommend it to others.  =
Don't
be intimidated about DE.  We had a young woman in our group that wanted =
to
quit after the first session as "things were a bit scary", but she hung =
in
there and made it all the way.  The rain was a bit disheartening at =
first,
but is amazing how fast you can go, and I'm glad it was wet at first =
since
I learned more that way.

Scott and I will be back May 2nd!  He did great too, in spite of a little
fish-tailing at 100 mph in 3rd down the main straight... I think he's got
enough power!
