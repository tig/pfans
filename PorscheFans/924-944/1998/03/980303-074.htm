Let me think... The last guy that called me Mikee just once, let alone 
three times is selling blue tinted H4s for a living and could no long 
afford his Porsche.  No No just kiddin'!  I didn't mean for the post to 
come across so strongly.  It seemed like you were suggesting these as an 
upgrade which they most certainly are not.  Yes, they will make your 
car/cycle look a little different but at the expense of vision and output. 
 Since they are simply coated with a blue coating the amount of light they 
put out is slightly reduced relative to a non-coated bulb.  Your choice.

Thanks for the laugh.
