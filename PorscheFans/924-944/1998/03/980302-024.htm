Hello.

I do not have the 924/944 parts catalog yet and neither my Technical specs
nor saved past list messages could not shed any light on the subject.  I
spent some time looking under my car during the weekend and with lots of
gentle scrubbing and soap I was able to clean some of the suspension
parts. 

On the front I have green-colored Bilsteins, PN 951.353.031.35.  On the
rear, I have gold-colored Bilsteins.  I cannot see the complete number, it
ends in 5303233, so I guess it is 951.353.032.33.  I could not pull any
part numbers off of the springs. All units have threads on the body so
that adjustable spring perches can be installed (which I have on the
front)  Is anyone familiar with these units?  Are they adjustable?  The
sway bars are the standard 25.5mm and 18mm front/rear as best as I could
measure.

As far as I can tell, these units can be used for coil-over conversions. 
I am glad the first owner of my car did not install springs in the back,
the ride is tight as it is.  

Also, I discoved brake cooling air ducts which feed from the front bumper
and end on openings on the wheel wells.  Are these standard issue for the
turbo front end?

As always, TIA.
