This is a common misperception. In talking to a patrolman last year while
waiting for some maintenance to be done on the San Mateo bridge, I was told
that there are "radar certified" officers. In accordance with the changes
in the law, radar is allowed, but the officer must go through an extensive
training and certification process to use it. Although I didn't ask the
question, I came away with the impression that not many California Highway
Patrol Officers are radar certified.

FYI.

<<<<<In California...they have gone to even greater measures.  No radar can
be used
throughout the state. Californians passed a law stating that it is a total
violation of their rights.  Police officers must time your speed between
two
points, pace behind you, or reverse clock (pass at a higher speed and see
if
anyone follows).  Amazingly, I did not find the highways speeds to be that
much different than the those in the eastern states.>>>>>>
