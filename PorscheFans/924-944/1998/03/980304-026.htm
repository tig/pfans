On the thread of run-ins with The Blue, I thought I would share my own
little story from a couple years ago.  Unfortunately I did not have the 944
then, but the story is interesting nonetheless.

It was my freshman year of college, around 1am, I was driving a buddy who
was severly intoxicated out to his frat house.  I was on one of those
streets that by all means should have been a 35mph zone, but was posted as
25.  But being 1am, on an empty road where 25 feels painfully slow, I was
doing around 40.  Was just a block from my destination when red'b'blue
flashes appear in my rear view mirror.

This was only the 2nd time I'd even been pulled over (got let off for
speeding the first time, though), plus I had the intoxicated minor in the
car with me, so I was feeling a little nervous.  Well, very nervous. 
Before the cop even got out of his car, I reached over to my glove box to
get my registration/insurance papers.  Bad Idea.  Next thing I know he has
his mega-size Maglite shining in my rear window, and starts yelling for me
to put my hands out the window.  "Put your hands out the window!  don't
move!  That's right, keep em right there!  Don't move!"  etc, etc as he
slowly walked up to my window.  I proceeded to get a good lecture on not
doing ANYTHING until the office asks me to.  So after being scolding for
reaching for my registration/insurance, he asked for my license,
registration, and insurance. :)  I gave him everything and he asks, "Do you
gamble son?"  "No sir."  "Ever play lotto?"  "No sir."  "Call it."  He had
flipped a coin!  I said tails, he handed me back my papers and said drive
slowly.  

I never saw the coin.
