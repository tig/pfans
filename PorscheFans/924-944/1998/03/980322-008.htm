Nathan,
You can get these parts from a dealer or many of the shops
advertising in Excellence.  The parts are available from Performance
Products, Auto Atlanta, Automotion, and most other large Porsche
catalog sellers.  Phone numbers are in the archives about a week
ago.  I recommend getting a Parts and Technical Reference Catalog
Water Cooled Models from MyPorsche (only $7.95) and buying from the
shops.  Get the catalogs as well to compare part numbers and prices.
You'll want the Haynes manual to help in replacing the rubber seals
and also some suggestions on maintenance of the crank mechanism.
On the headlamp, after disconnecting the negative terminal of the
battery, crank the headlight up using the knob on the top of the
motor.  Note where the binding is.  If the binding is in the
bellcrank assembly, the Porsche dealer has a special alignment
device.  One other thing, if there is no binding, then you might
have an intermittant electrical contact.  Clean the
electrical contacts with crocus paper or fine sandpaper and
also check out the relay on the side of the motor.
