hey all,

i found my radiator 75 percent obstructed by a "cardboard"
material i believe was the original buffer material that lived
under the nose panel (crest area) and above the rad housing.
it must of worked itself loose and fell in front of the rad. it fit
snuggly and flopped back under acceleration, elevating temps,
and dropped forward when decelarating, alowing cooling. 
this drove me nuts because the blockage was consistant
 with engine "work" causing me to belive it was a mechanical
 problem of some sort. to top it off, the material is black 
making it hard to see against the radiator,,,
removed and tossed, she ran much cooler (1st bar), until 
the fuel pump started crying.................
weird stuff,.....

eric (going quietly insane)
87-924S headless (temporarily) but still looks great  :~{
78-924  ungagged and screaming f/pump, but still a neck snapper  :o
87-911  1/24th scale model- faster than both of the above right now :(
