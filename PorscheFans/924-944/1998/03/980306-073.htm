Subject:  removing weight from a 951

I am in the process of removing weight off the front end of my 89 951. The 
headlites and all the mechanisms were replaced by a new 1 piece nose panel 
from GT racing. The ac system has also been removed, as well as the cruise 
control and  ws washer/pump. All this together is maybe 80# off the front end. 


3 questions...
has anyone removed the power steering from their 951 and if so was it still 
driveable for 
auto-x?   (running 245-45-16s on 9" rims all around) 
the Black Forest shop in san diego has warned me that unless I've got the 
forearms of Quasimodo, this is not a good move....

can you recommend a setup to remove weight off the inner front bumper and 
retain the stock outer appearance?

Since the intercooler is out of the car, should it be serviced somehow?

Thanx for any help...
