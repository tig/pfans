In terms of the aftermarket APE Mass Air kit installed on my car, the
actual MAF sensor is the same size (at least from what my mechanic
says) with the K-26S8 turbo as compared to the stock K-26 turbo.  The
only difference is apparently in the programming.

I've never shimmed the wastegate on my car as the custom KLR chip from
APE is in charge of regulating boost from what I understand.  In
addition, my wastegate has been malfunctioning as of late and I'm
trying to save up some $ for an aftermarket wastegate.

From what I understand from other members, shimming the wastegate will
help eliminate boost "creep" and keep the wastegate closed longer in
the upper rpms so as to reduce the stock car's tendency to have the
boost fall off above 5500 rpms or so.

From purely a hp standpoint, running more boost from a shimmed
wastegate will increase power more on a K-26S8 turbo than a stock K-26
as the turbo can flow more in the upper rpms (in my opinion).

> Do chips make much improvement on the \'S\'?

In looking at the ads from APE, Weltmeister, and Superchips, they
claim to make more hp/torque with the S turbo, again because it has a
larger housing/flows more.

Been there, done that!!  It's still better to blow a head gasket than
to shoot a piston through your block from too much boost. This is the
one reason why I was hesitant to go to the stronger Wide Ring Fire
Head Gasket but it's done me right so far...

Good luck and I hope I answered some of your questions.
