Jay,
    I agree that there is nothing particularly special about the 944
timing belt system. As to why no one else uses a special timing
belt tool, I can only offer my opinion. Many of the engines that use
similar belt systems are non-interference motors. Therefore, a
timing belt break is no big deal. For those that are interference
motors (which includes most of the VW motors), the cost of
replacement parts is significantly less than the cost of those for
a 944. Few people will argue that Porsche rarely leaves anything
to chance and we all know how expensive 944 valves are. It
seems logical to take additional precautions to protect them.
Again, this is just my opinion.
    My other theory about the timing belt tool is that one day a
Porsche engineer was at home in his bathroom standing on the
toilet hanging a picture. He slipped, fell off the toilet, and knocked
himself unconscious. While lying in the floor, the idea of a timing
belt tensioning tool came to him in a dream. Of course most people
call it a flux capacitor which, as we all know, is also the basis for
time travel. I really think this theory is more plausible than the first.
   Anyway, with most of the major car manufacturers, you'll find at
least one or two factory tools that carry outrageous price tags.
Volkswagen has a $150 wheel bearing removal / installation tool.
Mercedes Benz has a $500 ball joint removal tool and a separate
$300 installation tool.
   Is the timing belt tool really necessary?  Perhaps not. But, I drive
my car extremely hard and it gives me a very secure feeling knowing
that the car is put together to factory specifications.  For me, that
feeling of security was well worth the price of the tool.
   I didn't intend for this to sound like a sermon but, I guess I don't
like leaving anything to chance either. Sorry about the long post
George.

Clark
