I like the idea of having a way to identify other list members and promote
the list to other drivers, but I have something against decals.  After
putting so much effort into restoring the look of the previously neglected
paint on my pride and joy, I can't deface it with a sticker.  Other options
may be the static-type (non-glue) decals (sorry, don't knwo theproper name)
that can be placed on the interior of the rear glass, or a license plate
frame.  Of course you can't make frames as eye-appealing as stickers, but
anyone can go down to their local mall and have one engraved for cheap.

Just my 2/100ths of a USD.
