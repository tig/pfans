For fear of being flamed I have put on my nomex suit, boots, and
gloves.  You can't hurt me now!

I have a problem with this post due to the "he has never seen one set
too tight".  Now this is in reference to the timing belt(of course) and
is hidiously wrong.  If your belt is set too tight then you will put
more stress on the waterpump than it is designed for and can seriously
decrease it's life span.  Now if replacing water pumps annually turns
you on then by all means, tighten the sucker as tight as you can,
otherwise suck up the gut and buy the stupid tool.  Yes, the tool sucks,
it is outrageously priced, it was one function and a meager one at that.
But the tool will not decrease, much, in value and therefore sell it if,
heaven forbid, you sell your Porsche.  Let's say after 3 years of happy
ownership you sell your car and the tool.  Say you sell the tool for
$300.  Wow, that tool only cost you $33 a year.  You guys are right
that's just crazy.  That is WAY too much money to spend on such a stupid
thing.  Just go ahead a pay the $300 + for a couple hours of
maintenence.  But only if you make a LOT more money than me. :)
