All,

Thank you to everyone who responded about my steering anomaly.  It
looks like I may have a slow leak in the system from the bottom of the
reservoir, so I will need to replace the hoses.  The other issue--poor
steering feel, wandering--are going to be dealt with next week.  It
turns out that I met the mechanic who did the alignment and he was
taking the car for a test drive with me as a passenger.  He agreed
that the alignment was not correct and that they would redo the front.
He mentioned he had seen a similar problem on a 911 and it turned out
to be a tower brace.  I informed him that I had a Cambermeister on the
car and he said that he did not even open the hood for the alignment
and that it is necessary to remove the bar, set the alignment, and
then reinstall the bar.  It is going to be done for free (to me
anyway), so hopefully I'll have a perfect steering 951 next week! :)
Does this strut brace alignment problem make sense?

The basic recommendation I received on the rack from the list was to
check for leaks, but there were none to be found (except from the
hose).  The mechanic said that leaks are pretty much the only failure
mechanism he has seen from a steering rack, but he is only 30 years
old.

Thanks for the advice,
Clark
