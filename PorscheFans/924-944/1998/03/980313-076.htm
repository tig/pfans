Paul,

At $232 each I think the -30 is made from shredded $5 bills... no, make
that 50s mixed in with the rubber :-)

Interestingly, my opinion would be that the -30 part, which is the M030
option part might just be inferior to the upgraded -01 part.  The -30 is
no longer available from PCNA, but some dealers still have them... at a
price.  That means these are most likely old stock items.  The M030 =
caster
mount on my son's 951S looks identical to the one on my S2, only it has
harder rubber.  Comparing even this harder rubber item to the latest
version it appears to me that the new version is better.  This is
substantiated by the Tech Bulletin itself since it also lists the '88 944
Turbo S and the '89 Turbo as cars affected.  Why would Porsche recommend
changing the caster mount to the newer style if it wasn't better than the
M030?  Anyway, that's my reasoning.
