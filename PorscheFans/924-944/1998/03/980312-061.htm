Okay, I'm bored, but this may be interesting to some.  I'm trying to
develop some new symbols and graphics here at work, and as I'm
researching existing/old ISO standards and symbols, I decided to check
out the symbols that correspond to our porsche model identification
numbers.  Here's what ISO 7000 has to say about the cars (well, these
are their definitions for the symbols and my interpretations):

ISO Symbol #924:  Movement with return to the counter direction; U-turn
(hmmm, could they be talking about Porsche and it's decision to pursue
watercooling?)

ISO Symbol #944:  Accelerated fast run; accelerated fast speed  ('nuff
said)

ISO Symbol #951:  Helical movement  (this one's pretty weak, since the
911's seem to spin more oftten on the track!)

ISO Symbol #968:  Rotation in the direction of production  (watercooled
development culminating and coming full circle to the 968 design?)

Well, that was a waste of time, but it distracted me from work for 5
minutes.  At least the 944 definition was right on!
