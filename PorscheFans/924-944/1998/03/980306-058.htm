I'm new to the 924/944 list. I have an '85 Carrera Targa and, recently, my
wife totaled her bimmer. In shopping about for a replacement, I stumbled on an
'86 944 that really looks pretty good. It has 99k miles and has recently had
tranny and clutch replacement. The car is clean and drives strong. The brakes
don't feel as solid as my 911's but I'm having a prepurchase inspection on
monday and will ask them to look at the brakes in particular. I requested and
received a carfax vehicle history report on the car and have a question. The
car wasn't originally registered, according to their records (which they
caution can be incomplete) until Jan. of 1988. This made me wonder if the car
could be a grey market euro car. Is there a way to check the VIN number to see
that it's an American spec car? Also, for '86's is there anything in
particular I should watch for? 
Thanks in advance!
