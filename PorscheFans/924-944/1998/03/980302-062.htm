Hello P-Fans & Clark

=09The design target for the 928 project was suppose to be a 5.0L engine =
with=0A300 Hp. Porsche latter feared that would make the car too close fo=
r comfort in=0Athe 911 performance area!!! So Porsche de-tuned the motor =
to 4.5L with 219 Hp.=0AIt was not until the sales of the 928 slowed down,=
  did Porsche give the OK=0Afor a larger displacement/higher output Hp fo=
r the 928. It wasn=92t until =9188=0AM.Y. for the USA, that Porsche met t=
he =93300 Hp=94 goal, actually 316 Hp for the=0A=9188 928 S4 models. And =
to think that Porsche had a 300 Hp 928 engine back in=0Athe early =9170=
=92s making that kind of power! No wonder they did not want to=0Aupset an=
y 911 with a faster model than the beloved 911 !!!


A Side Note:  The =9185 euro =94928S=94 had a 4.7L, 300 Hp engine while t=
he US=0Amodels made do with 240 Hp motor! No wonder the gray market cars =
flourished=0Ahere in the US market at that time!
