Sorry to hear that your rubber damper ring has broken. I did mine on an 87
924S, which should be the same routine. The part alone is, at it best around
$475.00. I got mine from vertex. You do replace the whole thing, which
consists of an aluminum ring with a rubber disk center to which the driveline
fitting is bonded. The starter ring gear must be salvaged from the old one.
The bolts which hold the damper to the flywheel also go through the ring gear.
Be careful not to break it taking it off the old damper. It is generally
considered easier to remove the transmission and then slide the bellhousing
along with the driveline backward. This is no picnic however. You will want
the car well up n really sturdy blocks. Do not drive the car anymore until its
fixed, as the rubber will continue to tear apart until scraps of it damage the
dme senders which hang into the top of the bellhousing. If they get bent it
becomes really hard to get the bellhousing off, I know. This is a big job, for
which I would block out 2 full weekends if all goes well. You need to
disconnect the transmission oil lines at the unit and at the bellhousing, all
kinds of wiring, starter motor, exhaust sytem, all must go to get that
bellhousing back. Note that there are hooks on the drive tube where it goes
over the torsion spring housing, and you must lift the tube at that point or
it will not slide back far enough. The only special tools you will need are:
-torque wrench
-good quality 12 point triple squared tool for cv joints
-good quality metric allen head tools for sockets for various fittings (6, 8,
and 10 mm)
There is very little room behind the engine for working on the transmission
oil lines, be patient. You really should have the manual for this job. I could
fax you the relevant pages if you do not own one. Its at least 1500 bucks in
labor to have this job done, so it may be worth it to do yourself as long as
you know what you are in for before you start. Good luck
.
