Hi, All.

I realize there have been some frustrations with the perceived wasted
bandwidth lately, but IMHO our humor is one of the things that I really
enjoy about the list.  God forbid we should ever take ourselves and our
cars so seriously that we can't have fun with either one...............

So, what I am proposing is for the list to come up with the Top Ten
Things NOT To Say When a Trooper Asks, "Do you know why I stopped
you today, sir/ma'am?"

For example:

"Is it because the corpse in the trunk is bleeding again?"

"Because my Stealth 4000 Mobile Jamming Unit is disrupting every
electronic device within a two-mile radius?"

"Because my sonic boom blew off your rear view mirrors?"

"Because you're nowhere close to your quota this month?"

"Because this is a Porsche?"

Anyway, I'm sure you get the idea.  After we collect a bunch of
suggestions, I will submit them all to the list for your consideration. 
Respond directly if you are concerned about using the bandwidth.

Thanks,

James
