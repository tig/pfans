Hello Denny & P-Fans
=09
=09Installing a test-pipe will not change the fuel enrichment curve. In f=
act I=0Areccomend you check the C0% after the test-pipe instalation. The =
headgasket=0Awill only blow if you run too much boost with the engine pin=
ging. ie: too low=0Aoctane or too much boost. There have been several hea=
dgasket updates over the=0Ayears. My car has 165K on it with APE stage II=
 chips, and knock on wood no=0Aheadgasket failure - yet!

=09Main benifits of removing the car and using a test-pipe:

1). Turbo spools up faster: full boost 500 rpms sooner!!!
2). Throttle response is also better/faster. On throttle transitions from=
 no=0Aboost to full      
      boost, the turbo gauge seems to be more linear in its response curv=
e.
3). The sound is great! Only slightly loader @WOT. Real throaty and mello=
=0Aother times. 
4). The exhaust smells - good. lots of Nox and all that good stuff...

=09
PS: my car passed the states emmision test with flying colors!!!
