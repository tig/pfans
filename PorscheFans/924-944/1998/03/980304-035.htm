Yikes!  What a lousy story.

Way back in the 18th century, a bunch of us Porsche drivers from the thirteen
original colonies got fed up with that sort of treatment, and declared our
independence from the Mother Country, waging a bitter battle for freedom, no
taxation without representation, and the right to drive on the right hand side
of the road, like God intended!  I still remember the rallying cry:  "Don't
shoot until you see the whites of their H4's!"

It all worked out for a few centuries, until a few British moles (names of
Nader, Claybrook, and others) infiltrated into positions of influence and
began eroding our freedoms.

Now we are in a pitched battle again, against RADAR, GATSO, LASER, VASCAR,
NASCAR (oops, not that one).  Next thing you know, you guys will be invading,
trying to take us back.  No way, buster!!!!

;-)  Clearly, I have too much free time!
