Donovan,

When you looked at your timing belt, did you check to see that it was indeed
turning the cam gear as the crack was turned.  I once had a timing belt failure
on a german-made Capri (non-interference engine, whew!) where the belt was 
still where it should be, but the belt ribs had slipped on the crank gear.
The belt would remain stationary while the crackshaft turned.
