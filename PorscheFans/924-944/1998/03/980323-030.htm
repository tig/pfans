We had over 30 1st time drivers in our group and in our region =
instructing
is strictly a voluntary thing.  Hopefully enough show up to cover =
everyone
at the 2:1 ratio.  Sure it would have been nice to have our own full-time
instructor, but that wasn't going to happen.

It wasn't a problem for me since we didn't go that fast (relatively) the
first time out and I had no trouble just tagging long for two laps.  I'm
sure there were others that didn't feel so confident however because the
initial speeds were much higher than originally spoken about at ground
school.  That probably intimidated some drivers right off the bat.  If
they told us 45 mph in ground school, that's what they should have stuck
to on the first run.  Instead it was 70 + at times, at least with my
instructor.

Obviously, not everyone had the same skill level, which was readily
apparent during the faster sessions as some of the drivers never did get
up to speed by the end of the day.

I felt confident enough in the last session to go pretty fast, but I'll =
be
the first to admit I need a lot more practice and more time with a good
instructor.
