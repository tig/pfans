Hello,

I just got back from a two day mini-vaca last Sunday and after getting
home and having my reunion with my 86 951 I noticed some small puddles
under the car.  My car has never really leaked before, and these aren't
drips, they're far larger.  Anyway, I jacked the car up and noticed that
there is a small rubbery plug on my steering rack that seemed wet.  When
I gently tugged on it to see if it was loose it came right out.  And
immediately after doing that...nothing happened.  I would assume that
this plug's sole duty in life was to keep fluid inside, but sadly it
seems that it failed.  I assume this is the power steering rack fluid
plug.

My first question....Is the car driveable or will I burn my steering
rack and/or pump?
My second quest...What is the part number for that little thingee
(plug)?
Third question......How much does this type of situation cost?
And lastly.............Is this a shadetree project?

Thanks for the help.
