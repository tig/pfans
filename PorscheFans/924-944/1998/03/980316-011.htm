Yesterday afternoon, I started my car (87 951) and found that I could
not turn the steering wheel.  There were some metal sounds and the
wheels were not turning.  I tried a couple of times and then the
wheels starting turning and the sounds went away.  I shut off the car
and popped the hood.  The power steering fluid reservoir had bubbles
in the fluid, but was still just above the low mark.  I went ahead and
topped it off and the problem went away.  Also, my car, after just
being aligned last week is back to wondering all over the road.  I
have replaced every part of the front suspension/steering in the last
year except for the upper strut bearings/mounts(?) and the rack
itself.
My question is, is there a new (rebuilt) steering rack in my immediate
future?


Clark,

When my rack went bad, it was the seals. If you haven't alread, peel back
the protective boots at both ends and see if fluid leaks out. I'm sure you
can guess the cause.

There has been a number of posts over the past few months on the pros and
cons of rebuilt racks and a few folks who were able to successfully rebuild
their own by just buying seals. If you haven't noticed those, check the
archives and I'm sure you'll find alot of helpful info. I had a used rack
installed from Zims and it has worked fine for over a year now. It has also
been strongly recommended that if the rack is replaced you also
clean/replace the reservoir as it is likely the filter at the bottom of it
is clogged up. I replaced mine when I also replaced those expensive power
steering hoses which started leaking big time about 3 months after replacing
the rack.

It's likely others will have a more technical response, but FWIW...
