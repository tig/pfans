Surya and all,

When I got my '84 944 all my friends told me how expensive it would be for
the insurance.  I used to do business with Allstate, but they tried to screw
me once to many times and I changed.  I have my 944 insured as my "company"
car with just liability until I get it like I want it.  It costs me
$225/mths.  The full blown comprehensive would only be $550 or so for 6
mths.  Allstate, as far as I am concerned, will try to do a number on you if
you let them.  Shop around!

Just my .02 worth,

Bill
'84 944 NA
'87 951 wannabe
