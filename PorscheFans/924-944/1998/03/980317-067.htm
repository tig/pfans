Hi,

Well, yesterday I had the (noisy) cam belt tension rechecked by my local
shop.  They did the tension setting per the Porsche tech bulletin =
(#9208),
which says to use the gauge and set the tension cold to 4.0-4.3 units.
This is supposed to eliminate or reduce the weird noises heard at around
1800 rpm.

Some of the noise I was experiencing at 1800 rpm is gone, but there is =
now
noise down at 1200-1400 rpm.  Seems I can't win with this thing, so I
guess I will just leave it alone and enjoy driving it.  Maybe a good
beating on the track this weekend will teach it a lesson :-)
