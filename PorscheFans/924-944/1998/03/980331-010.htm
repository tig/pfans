Before I bought my 951 "S" I was looking for a 928.  I was subscribed to
the 928 list for some good info.  Well about a week into the list I
decided to answer a post, and I guess some of the list didn't like it
cause I was "unknown" and "new".  None of these people knew I have owned
porsches for many years, and was my local PCA regions last president.
None the less I logged on my computer the following day to find some
kind sole had unsubscribed me from the entire Porschefans list.  All of
them, ones I wasn't even subscribed to!  I did get hard feelings, and I
will never go back to the 928 list even if I had of purchased a 928.  I
I know where he is comming from and feeling attacked, but!  I have to
say you guys are much better than the 928 guys.  I have only had my car
for a few months, and have posted quite a few time.  Popular posts or
not, I have felt welcome here, and free to say my piece.

All this talk about tech and non tech, well I think the answer is the
"NTECH" in the title! easy, simple, and it works!

Oh, and by the way, the think I have enjoyed the most lately on the
list?, it was the "your are what you drive" post.  I really, really,
enjoyed that!  And DAMN, it wasn't tech!!

I wouldn't trade this list or any of it's content for the world.  I
think the list is the sum of it's members.

Just my $26.97 worth of opinion (I'm a slow typist and my time is worth
a lot!)
