gary, the relay may be the problem, having replaced it and still no
fuel,
let me say check the wires.
in a pinch the fuel wire is black with green stripe and runs along the
left side under the little running board. it comes out the side connects
to a small plastic connector. from there it goes to the aux fuse panel.
the red andblue wire is the bat.
red and blk. to the aux fuse#2.
green and white is to coil.
blk. is to the C15 that's one of the plugs on the back of the real
board.
brown is ground
the spooky part is removing the aux panel and then the relay board.
all those wires. don't be scared they all go into the plugs and the
plugs are color coded and only fit in one way.
when you bring the board forward and down a little, you can see the back
of the fuel pump relay.
look closely at the terminals are they frayed,can you see any green
tarnish? 
i got a "lyle" term. remover tool from pep boys for $10 and took the 
brittle tarnished wires out of the loom one at a time replaced them and
no more fuel prob. i spliced in new terms. at the place where the blk
and grn wire connected, then retied the loom with plastic ties instead
of tape so i could go back in if need.
while i was in there i changed the connector to the power windows so
they work with ing. off and hooked up my radio and alarm (both after
market) to termials.
think logicaly, follow the wires, and save money while you learn about
your car.
good luck, ed(read the book)aguilar.
