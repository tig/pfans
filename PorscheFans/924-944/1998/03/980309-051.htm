If you haven't read the FAQ on 944's be sure to do that. I don't have the=
 URL for the FAQ but someone can get that for you. It will answer many =
of your questions.

I have 137k miles on my 84 and going strong. It still has excellent compr=
ession, almost no oil use, and only some minor oil leaking (more like wee=
ping) which I think is very common for the older 944's. The list rarely =
talks about serious electrical problems so I don't think this is a big =
concern...same goes for squeaks and rattles. Mine hardly rattles at all. =


The suspension and transaxle are very strong and usually just need mainte=
nance. An older car will likely need shocks, bushings, and bearings on =
the front. If you here a clicking from the rear on acceleration it may =
need new CV joints or they may just need to be repacked. Figure that into=
 your evaluation of the price. As far as the clutch the rubber doughnut =
in the center breaks up often before the disc is worn. Signs are a bad =
clunk when shifting (about 1200 for new clutch and works).

If you've read the list long enough you know we usually go through all =
the problems on a regular basis. A good suggestion is to start in the arc=
hives at the beginning and read all the archives till you're caught up. =
Something I have yet to do.

Hope this helps.
