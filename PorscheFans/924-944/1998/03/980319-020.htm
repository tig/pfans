I wouldn't assume anything with these engines.  Some are capable of exceeding
that number of miles.

You don't specify whether you have a turbo or NA car.

Check the intake to see if there is oil in it.  If there is then it may signify
a problem with crankcase pressure. In which you should do the following
anyway...

I'd first do a compression test then a leakdown test.  A handy way to do a leak
down test is to remove the camshaft.  That way you don't have to try and put
the engine to TDC for every piston.

The leak down allows you to hear where air is leaking (if any).  You can use an
automotive steth. to check to see if it is leaking from the valves.  If you
discover a leaking valve, bop it a couple times with a rubber mallet (lightly)
to see if it just isn't seated correctly.

If you discover a valve is leaking, remove the head and take it to a machine
shop to check valve wear and machine the valve seats.  (also replace bushings
and seals).

If your compression and leakdown tests are fine, the leakage is probably the
valve stem seals.

If you have a turbo, then your turbo may be blowing oil.  Turbos don't usually
go bad unless something else in the engine is messing with its operation.  For
instance crankcase pressure will cause a turbo to leak.  But a leakdown can
help determine that (crankcase pressure).

Hope this helps.
