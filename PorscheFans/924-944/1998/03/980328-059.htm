I recently purchased the hydraulic engine mount updates for my 85.5 944 n/a
and I heard that installation will require longer bolts than the originals.
It does not appear that the longer bolts shipped with my new mounts. Does
anyone know exactly what type and size bolts are required? Part number?

I will not be installing the mounts myself, but I want to make sure that I
have all the necessary parts before I bring it to my mechanic.

Best regards,

P.S. It was a pleasant surprise to discover that engine mounts are going
for almost half the price that they were a couple months ago. Just out of
curiosity, does anyone know why?
