 Bottom line, the GReddy controller will work on the stock wastegate
but not any better than the stock system.  Have the guy you are buying
it from
give you a complete explanation of how and why it will work.  When the
rest
of the explanation on the dual chamber gets pounded into my head, I will
post it.

  Thanks for trying Jim but I still don't understand how it works.  I
get the
idea that the advantage is longevity.  Powerhaus says it is not a dual
chamber
but a dual port with a pressure sensor in and a pressure sensor out but
David
Reins in unable to explain how it works but he says it helps.

  There is an advantage to using the GReddy Profec with the stock
wastegate.
The advantage is that it will limit boost to a predetermined level and
it is
controllable inside the car.  I only hit about .8 bar boost in 1st gear,
but in
4th I'm at 1.3 bar.  It is my understanding with boost control unit I
could set
it to 1.2 bar and that is the level it would reach but not exceed in
every
gear.  My understanding is that the control is only in the line from the

manifold that pressurizes the diaphragm and that the fuzzy logic learns
what
pressure it needs to reach a desired boost level.

  My belief is that the wastegate will not work any better but also it
will
work no worse.  The benefit I am getting is control of boost not better
wastegate performance.
I guess the downside is not knowing if the wastegate is leaking and the
car is
spooling up slower.  I wonder if the aftermarket wastegate could not
leak also,
but maybe it is of higher quality and better design than the stock
unit.  As I
said before I will probably end up buying an aftermarket wastegate after
my
wallet recovers from my previous mods.

  I am supposed to get my Mass Flow Sensor in today and if I get it
installed
I'll try to do another dyno this weekend.  Also the GReddy Profec should
be in
later this week but I'll probably wait until after the Dyno to install
it.
Thanks for trying Jim.

I sent this message yesterday and am resending.
