Joe recently posted a note about a "whining" sound coming from his gas tank. I
endured the same problem in my 83 944 149K for nearly a year, until the car
began to hesitate and stall one day.

Took it in, and the mechanic found A LOT of debris and gunk in the gas tank. In
the tank there is a canister which is lined with a protective net. Taking out
this net and cleaning it thoroughly solved the whining completely. I used to
turn the radio up to keep from hearing that awful groaning sound from the back.

The hesitation, however, turned out to be a faulty O2 sensor, which is to be
expected on an 83 with this many miles.

I also want to thank all the responses I got to my window switch post. It was
really disappointing to shell out $30 for the switch and not see it work.

You were all correct in that the faulty switch was on the DRIVER'S door, and
not the other. Strange enough, I had just replaced that one a few months back,
which is why I never thought of it. It still surprises me how the passenger
door switch depends on its driver's door counterpart in order to operate.

THANKS SO MUCH!

Luis
