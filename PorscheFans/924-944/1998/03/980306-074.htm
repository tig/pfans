Looks cool though and helps individualize the car a little bit.

I called AIR a while back and requested information on their vented 944
nose panels.  I was told to go find copy of Excellence with the yellow 94=
4
on the cover.  OK......then I asked about a list of customers that I coul=
d
contact that had bought the panel.  The person on the phone told me "lots=
"
of people had them and he didn't have a list of satisfied customers.  I
took this to mean he didn't have satisfied customers and forgot about the=

AIR vented nose panel.

I still like the look and concept.  Does anyone make a panel that fits?
