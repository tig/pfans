Matt wrote about car care.  3M Automotive has a web page
(http://www.mmm.com/market/automotive/index.html) that may answer lots =
of these
questions. I see that I was quoted  in issue III of the car care newsle=
tter
(wish someone would have told me rather than finding out by accident). =
  In
this issues, it is suggested to use Avon Skin So Soft on bugs and tar. =
 Maybe
this would work on tree sap - don't know.

The best product to use for oxidation is 3M Perfect-It Foam Pad Glaze. =
 The web
page lists lots of solutions but using this product is above and beyond=
 the
results you would get using the other products.  You do have to wax
afterwards.  Depending on the severity, you may need to use with a rota=
ry
buffer and foam pad.  It takes some practice but can be done by just ab=
out
anyone using caution.  Be especially careful on edges as the paint is u=
sually
thinner in those areas.  Depending on the condition of the paint, you m=
ay get
some smearing of the product - don't worry about it.  You can remove th=
e smear
by hand with some product on a towel.  If the paint isn't too bad, the =
above
product can be used by hand.  You choose the wipe to use with the produ=
ct.  We
have had best luck using a 100% paper towel with a low recycled paper c=
ontent.
Also want to stick to the paper towels that use the shorter softer wood=
 fiber.
Good examples are the Scott Premiere towel or Scott Wypall.  We make a =
wipe for
this application but you can get the same results for much less using t=
he Scott
towels.  If you prefer towels, use only a 100% cotton towel, any synthe=
tic
content and you will scratch your paint.  Towels that have been washed =
with
fabric softener may leave streaks on your car. Wax your car with whatev=
er (if I
were to suggest a wax, the thread could get longer then the tensioning =
tool
thread.)

Any questions, e-mail me.
