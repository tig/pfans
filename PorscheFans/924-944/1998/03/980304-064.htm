Hello Mike & P-Fans
=09I did have a simular noise on my 944 turbo a few years ago. On my car =
it only=0Amade the noise on hard left turn when I had two or three people=
 in the car,=0Aturn left hard. I found out the rear of my car sat really =
low. The right CV=0Ajoint/axle would ride (or rattle) on inner part of th=
e stub axle. My trans=0Awould shift slightly while turning and sine the r=
ear of the car was so low=0A(and the CV were marginal/kind of loose) the =
drive shaft would contact the=0Ainside part of the stub axle. I simply ha=
d the rear of the car raised back to=0Astock level. I just happened to =
=93solve=94 my problem after replacing my shocks=0Aand doing a complete a=
ligment and hieght adjustment. 
=09You can check you rear ride hieght easily. Place you car on a level ro=
ad. The=0Acar should be empty, with 1/2 fuel level and correct tire press=
ures. Measure=0Afrom the ground straight up (horizontally) to the middle =
of the rear bumper.=0AThe correct ride hieght is: 522 mm +/- 20 mm, or 20=
..55 inches +/- just over=0A3/4 of an inch. My car was at 19 inches when i=
t was making that wierd noise. I=0Ahad the new ride hieght set to the low=
 spec. The car looked too gooffy sitting=0Awith the rear up high! 

Good Luck
