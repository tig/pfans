Beautiful car, very good condition.  77,000 miles.  New brakes (rotors, pads,
et al, by dealer - Jacobs Motorsport, Naperville, IL), new timing belt 400
miles ago (dealer installed - Napleton Porsche, Elmhurst, IL), cooling system
pressured checked, flushed; clutch and linkage adjusted; new gas shocks; fresh
tune; everything works - even the AC and sunroof.  Straight, clean, no rust,
red.  Excellent interior, phone dial rims, good BFGs.  

I've owned this car since last September, and with the mild winter here in the
Midwest have had the chance to put on 1100 miles on clean roads as well as a
blast working on it.  Great running/looking car, and I will be very sorry to
see it go, but I need more horsepower from my leisure car.  I'm asking $7500
or your best offer.  Please send inquiries to Red818@aol.com.  Location:
Western suburbs of Chicago.  

2 notes:  I have only been on the Digest for a couple months, and I am blown
away by you guys!  I hope the factory picks up on the technical stuff you guys
share. It's amazing. 

The other thing is, if you want any rims for this car, the only ones I've been
able to find are 17" Borbets C2s from the Tire Rack.  The offset on the 924S
phone dials is different from the 944.  Nice rims, good price (@$260 each) but
I didn't need new tires yet.
