We change tires and go home <yawn>.

Driver's education as others have been talking about is essentially an
untimed event. The reasons it is untimed has to do with insurance, and in
some regions, philosophy.

If you are at an untimed event and you crash, then you should/might/could
be covered under your car insurance and (in the US) your medical insurance
and life insurance. (I have heard instances where insurance companies have
refused and had to be sued. YMMV.) Some time ago, your warranty still
applied. (I see now PCNA has added "track use" to the warranty exclusions.
It used to be just "competition and racing.")

If you are at a timed event and crash, you probably are NOT covered under
car insurance, life insurance (heaven forbid), and, (in the US), *maybe*
your medical insurance.

YMMV, of course. Check with your agent.

There is also this philosophy or "attitude" thing - that some people feel,
rightly or wrongly, that DE should be separated entirely from anything
remotely construed with racing - that DE should teach people how to enjoy
their Porsche to the fullest of their abilities, and that goal is totally
different from and should not be confused with driving a car faster than
the next person or racing them around the track.

I am not saying this approach is better than another, I'm just saying some
PCA regions have adopted this approach.

Hmm. I'm inclined to disagree with both those statements, vehemently with
the first, but those are totally different can of worms I don't want to get
into right now.

I know a *lot* of people who would question that in context of driver's
education, including myself.

However, given the type of event you're coming from I can understand what
you're saying.

FWIW, your description of your region's events sounds like a LOT of fun and
very safe. I'd like to attend. As you have already surmised, it is a
totally different experience then what many people experience in driver's ed.

P.S. for those who are still reading... I think I sense a general trend
here... the more easterly the region, the more, er, restrictive the
driver's education is.
