Read closer, Tom.

Factory specs are 4.0 +/- 0.3 for a new belt or 2.7 +/- 0.3 for a used belt.

7.5% and 11.1% respectively.

The "half-turn" method, shade tree method, ALL of the uncalibrated
methods are unmitigated crap and are going to cause some crashed
heads.

This entire discussion is idiotic.
