Hi,

I just came back from my second kart race ever and my first "official"
kart race (one with trophies and for points).  I consider this my first
real kart race.

Anyways, I thought you'd like this story.  On Saturday, I practiced like
hell spending over an hour of track time out there trying to figure out
the track.  This is the same track I drove last week in the rain on slicks.
In the dry, the track is amazing, the guys with DA say that the kart hits
over 1.4g into the high speed sweeper at the end of the straight and that
is with the regulation control tire, not the all-out stickies.

So, in the morning I'm not doing too hot, kind of missing apexes and not
being too confident with the throttle.  By mid afternoon, I'm starting
to feel better and my coach thinks I'm getting into a better groove.
At this point, I'm finding that I'm passing everything around me.  One
session, I start 19th out of 19 karts and ended the practice session
the 2nd kart!  The following 3-4 sessions were the same, passing people
all the time.  I did inside passes, outside passes, crazy passes, drafting
passes, you name it, I tried it.  I'm trying to build a reputation as
being someone who is not easily intimidated so I lean on the guy I'm passing
pretty bad and I never lift first :)

Come Sunday, the race day, I'm feeling pretty good, but I'm a bit concerned
that these dudes may pull out their super fast race motors or something.
We've been working our butts off to get the kart ready and knew of a 
technical issue that would disqualify me, but we didn't have time to fix
it before the weekend.  This technical infringement is worth a maximum of
2/10ths of a second per lap.  On the other hand, our lack of time also
resulted in us not being able to fully exploit the rules and could easily
get that 2/10ths back.  But, to be clear, we knew we would be DQed and
accepted;  I would likely be a mid pack finisher anyhow, or so we thought.

Come the qualifying session, I get sent out and start flying, I'm feeling
really good and very confident, the kart feels great, the new slicks are
starting to heat up, perfect, until the starter let a guy come out in 
front of me on my hot lap!  I'm on the guys tail by the first hairpin and
he slows me an easy second.  Because I was a DQ entry, my times didn't
matter anyhow, I would be started from the back of the pack.

First session out (the Pre-Final) determines your starting position for
the Final Race.  In the pre-final, I started in 7th place and finished
in 2nd place after passing anything and everything.  I did an awesome
pass going into a chicane, I was proud of myself :)  This dude had mirrors
on his kart and kept blocking me down the straight when I'd draft him.
I pulled alongside him twice on the outside but wasn't stupid enough to 
try it.  Then, when he's too busy looking ahead, I attacked him on
the entry to the chicane.  I took his line and left him with just enough
track to pull in behind me :)  My coach said I drove too hard and needed
to calm down (he isn't the first to say that to me!)

Since I was DQ'ed, my 2nd place finishing position didn't make any difference,
I would start from the back again.  So, I go out and drove like it was
a practice session, with all the passing and the like.  I really calmed
down, even loosening my grip on the wheel down the straight to relax my
tense muscles.  In this session, I was passing karts every few laps.  I
finally came upon a guy that was really hard to pass, so I made sure that
I got a really good exit coming onto the straight, tucked in behind him,
drafted him all the way to the end of the straight, then pulled alongside
him.  We went into the corner side by side, all the way around.  At that
point, I realized that if I allow him to do this, he'll have the proper
line in the next corner and will take the position back, so I went WOT
and went for my proper apex, essentially closing the door firmly in his
face :)  Just call me Earnhardt from now on, thank you.

After this pass, I continued to put in some good laps and pulled about
a 3-5 second gap on him.  Dismayed with not having karts in front, I 
saw the white flag, then the chequered.  I knew it was a good session,
but it didn't occur to me that I had just finished in 1st!

At the weigh in, there were crowds of people around wanting to see who
the hell I was.  It was pretty cool, the only bad part being that I
was DQ'ed so I technically didn't win, but that wasn't our intention,
it was just to get more seat time.

The pit chief of the guy who I passed and came in 2nd came up to me all
pissed off and asked why I would race in a DQ situation.  I said that
I was just a novice trying to figure out how to drive.  It was funny
to watch his face after that :)  If you really think about it, I wasn't
far off from my true intentions of being out there.

The way I look at it is, 0.2 seconds x 10 laps = 2 seconds.  If I finished
3-5 seconds ahead of the 2nd place dude, I would still have been 1st,
and if not, at least a 2nd.  By the time my B&Bed motor is ready and all
the other little things are done, I'll be at least 0.5-1 second faster than
I was today, then, that's when my coach said, the party really begins.

We had some stunning weather here in B.C. this weekend with the view of
all our local mountains nearby.  The bright red 944T looked just perfect
in that environment.  I took her for a hard drive through some twisties
and hope to use some of my karting knowledge at the next autocross and
see if it helps.

By the way, the dream part was to win my first ever race.  Even though I
technically did not win my first race, I am confident that the next race
I enter where my kart is in perfect harmony with the rulebook, I will
take the chequered in first place!
