On the CR test, the engines were hardly even turned off, these were taxis
after all.  A great amount of engine wear occurs in the first minutes of
operation when the oil is cold and not necessarily in all the right places
with the right properties.  The CR test did not include this as a
parameter, (but did mention it as if that lent more validity to anyone
other than fleet car operators). IMHO, that nullifies the validity of the
CR test, especially for cars like ours which may spend two weeks or more
parked and are then started with the oil almost completely drained to
their oil pans.
