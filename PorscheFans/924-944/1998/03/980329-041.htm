<< For the past two days, this has been happening to me.  When I'm driving, 
 I'll push in the clutch, shift gears, lift my foot from the pedal, but 
 the thing only comes up about a third of the way.  I have to stick my 
 foot underneath the pedal pull it up.  Once I put pressure on the clutch 
 pedal from behind, it'll will pop right up to normal position.  Any 
 ideas about what's going on?  If this has happened to any of you, what 
 was the financial damage? >>

David,

Been there . . . . Done that . . . . . Got the T-shirt!  It's most likely
either the clutch master or slave cylinder.  Chances are, if you replace one
of them the other will go out in a short period of time so it's best to
replace both and bleed the entire hydraulic system (you should bleed both
clutch and brake lines).  Once this is done, you should plan on purging the
old hydraulic fluid out of the system once every year or two.  If you do this,
you will probably never have to replace either of the cylinders again.  You
can order both cylinders from ads in Pano for $100 or so but you can expect to
spend the better part of a day in replacing them out and bleeding the system
unless you really know what you're doing (I apparently don't!) because
removing the starter can be a real bear.  Changing the hydraulic fluid will
also remind you of just how good the brakes are in these cars!

Have fun,
