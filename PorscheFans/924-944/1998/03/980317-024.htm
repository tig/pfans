     If you don't have the alignment tool for the oil pressre relief valve, 
     then before you tighten all of the housing bolts down, hand turn in 
     the PRV as you position and tighten the housing bolts down.  This is 
     critical so that the PRV won't be cocked, which will allow it to leak 
     and also jam internally.  
     
     Bob, if you don't have the updated 1 piece PRV, i suggest you get one. 
      This fixed my 'droning' sound at cold start up and it is easier to 
     reassemble the oil cooler housing.  Also, new o-rings and seal for the 
     PRV.  For the '86 updated PRV it is 944 107 935 11 and N 043 815 3 
     respectvely.  For you Mike, it is 944 107 935 01, N 043 815 3.

Hi,
     
If it's not too much trouble, would you happen to have the part #s for 
the oil cooler seals and related stuff?  I have a leak coming from that 
general area and I hope that's what it is.  I used to have list posts on 
this from about a year ago, but a virus got it and, moron that I am, I 
didn't have a backup of it.  Thanks.
