I'm not confronting anyone in particular here, but I'm getting lost on
these arguments over DE vs TT.  I've only been exposed to Rocky Mt Region
PCA events.  DE and TT are essentially synonymous out here.  Two days of
instruction for those that want and/or need it, conducted in 20 minute
practice sessions w/ 10-12 cars/session, each session based on cars, skill
and experience.  At the end, you may or may not participate in a
time-trial, w/ 2 cars on the track staggered in time.   IMHO, the practice
sessions are more dangerous than the time-trails.  Am I missing something
here? What do other regions do at the end of a DE if not timed laps? Seems
like timing your laps is the best metric for detemining whether or not your
driving skill has improved.  A primary function of DE is to teach drivers
the basics and how not to exceed one's limits.  If the lessons are
accepted, TT is not inherently more dangerous.  We've had two instances of
bent metal in the 8 DEs I've attended, both were in practice sessions,
neither involved rookies, and neither involved collisions.  Are we just
beating the odds?  I should add that we've got good instructors, a good
instructor/rookie ratio, extensive reiteration of track rules at the start
of every DE, consistent admonishment by instructors for over-aggressive
driving, and swift reprisal for infractions.  I like the arrangement.  Is
it that different from DEs in other regions?

I of course agree that once you've gained speed and experience in TT, and
you're pushing harder, your safety precautions should go up
proportionately.  And yes, you have to accept the fact that you may have to
walk home.  That's the nature of the sport.
