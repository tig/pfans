As reported in Technical Bulletin #9208:

Models affected: 944 S2 1989-1991

Concern:  Camshaft belt noise noticeable at approximately 1800 rpm with
the engine at operating temperature.

General Information:  Oscillations in the camshaft drive belt occurring
between the crankshaft and the cam belt tensioning roller can create =
noise
with the engine at operating temperature and engine speed of =
approximately
1800 rpm.  This noise can be effectively reduced or eliminated by
adjusting the camshaft belt tension using special too 9201.

Work Procedure:  yadda, yadda, yadda   5.  Using special tool 9201, =
adjust
the camshaft belt tension to scale value 4.0-4.3.
-------------------------------

Since I am experiencing just such a noise after my new cam belt was
retensioned using only the built-in spring adjuster, I'm going to ask the
shop to do it again with the gauge.  Don't know why they didn't do it =
that
way in the first place since they used the gauge on the balance shaft
belts, but maybe they don't have access to the tech bulletins and were =
not
aware of the procedure change.

Notice the recommended tension.  This is the same for a new belt.
Normally a new belt that has been run for 1800 miles should be =
retensioned
to 2.7 after an initial setting of 4.0.  Anyway, I'm tired of the noise.
