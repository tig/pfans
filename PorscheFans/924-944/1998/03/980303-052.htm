These bulbs are a waste of $$.  They are nothing more than a sight coating 
on the bulb to give the appearance of the xenon gas lights.  The H4 blue 
bulbs do not contain any xenon gas and if they did you would need an 
entirely new system to use them.  The only real advantage to the HID (High 
Intensity Discharge) lamps seen in the new cars, like the Porsche Litronic, 
is they produce the same candlepower output for small wattage input. 
 Typically they are using less than 50 watts each on high beam.  The 
downside to these headlights is the blue wavelength light they produce will 
reflect more in inclement weather.
