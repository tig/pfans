Hello Everyone,
This is my first time writing and I have only been a subscriber for a short
time, so if I ask questions that get posted and answered all of the time,
that's why. I have a 84 944 and I would like to know how to check the
throttle position switch? Should there be a click when it is first turned
and another when it's wide open? I also am having some trouble with my
timing belt. When I bought the car a new belt and water pump had just been
put in, about 300 miles ago. I checked the belt 1700 miles later and
noticed that there was a wear groove on the top and back edge (towards the
firewall). I replaced it and checked it a couple hundred miles later, this
time there was a groove on the belt towards the front of the car. I made
sure the belt was centered on all of the sprockets. Anyone know what I am
doing wrong? Can a normal belt tensioning tool be used on this belt? Also,
what do you line up the mark on the bottom balance shaft with? The mark I
lined it up with cannot be seen through the "peep hole" in the belt cover,
if that's what the hole is for. If anyone can help it would be greatly
appreciated.
