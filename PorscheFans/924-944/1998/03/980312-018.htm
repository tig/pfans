Randall:

Sounds like you're enjoying the MAF as much as I did when I had it
installed a couple of months ago!!  More power, better driveability
and the intake sound makes the price worthwhile!!

In trying to remember the mods on your car, I recall that you have the
K-27TDR turbo.  If this is the case, how has the drivability changed
with the MAF?  How soon does the boost come on now versus before?

In addition, as a FYI I went to purchase the dual port wastegate from
Powerhaus yesterday and they are willing to give it to my mechanic at
a little less than the list price of $895.  However, this is still a
little steep for me at this time.  Stillen quoted me $360 for a HKS
dual port "universal fit" wastegate but I'm hesitant to get it due to
fitment considerations (the Powerhaus unit requires very minor
modifications to fit a 951).  Have you heard of any other Porsche
aftermarket outfit that sells these?

Finally, good luck with the GReddy boost controller and looking
forward to hearing from you on how it works with the stock wastegate.
