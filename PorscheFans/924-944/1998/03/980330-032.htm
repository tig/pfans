Gang:

I just had to share my humiliating experience on an otherwise
beatuiful day in southwestern Connecticut...

Stopped by to see my mechanic/roomate at the shop who encouraged me to
street race (1/4 mile lenght on an unused road with no other
entrances/exits) a friend of his in her stock 1996 993.

Although this was supposed to be a rolling start due to my very worn
R1s, she lit up the tires from a deadstop.  Although my car got on
boost right away, she immediately had 2-3 car lengths on me and I
COULD NOT GAIN EVEN AN INCH ON HER!  The upside is that she couldn't
pull away away from me either after her holeshot but by then it was
too late.

Time to really think about getting my wastegate fixed and turn up the
boost so I don't have to endure any more ridicule...

Thanks for listening.
