    Sorry about the last one. I hit the send button instead of the save to
draft folder button. Since i opened my mouth I had better comment.
    My opinions
        Change your oil + filter approx every  3K no matter what your manual
or any body else says. Use a good "quality" filter ie Bosch, Kneight, Mann
etc. I don't care what oil really SFI standards make them all pretty equal,
give or take. I work for a company that has a fleet of 50 vehicles and they
use bulk no name oil. approx 60 cents a qt. The only oil related failures
they had were "lack of oil" due to people not checking it. These vehicles of
asst makes are doing 300,000 plus miles with very limited wear. They are not
treated nicely otherwise I gaurante you. Changing just the filter does not
remove soluble contaminents or anything smaller than your filters
capability. Changing just the filter does'nt change all of the oil and a
dirty oil filter may cause a pressure drop (unlikely but who knows really in
your application ). In an older high mileage motor with more blowby there is
a lot more solids and solubles and it becomes more important. Most engines
have dirty oil long before it breaks down. I'm sure there are exceptions.
Endurance racing, non-watercooled turbos maybe (i say maybe ), stationary
engines etc.
