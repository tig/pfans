Note to all who responded to my query.  Appreciate the swiftness and 
quality of the responses, except for Jim M advising me to trade my car 
in.  Guess every deck has a joker or two. 

Another topic, the same car, 1988 944 turbo S, has a slight front 
"clunking" sound just prior to coming to a complete stop.  Thought this 
might be brake related but the car has been upgraded to the 993 turbo 
based brakes (big red calipers) so I replace and repacked the front 
wheel bearings at the same time to eliminate that (not cheap).  

Sound did not go away, so I pulled the lower a arms and checked the ball 
joints and they seem good.  Put them back on with a new set of bolts 
etc.  Still have the sound.  Now I noticed if I jacked up the car and 
turn either right or left front wheel and then stop it suddenly by hand 
I get the same little "clunk" sound and can feel it in the coil spring 
and strut.  Could I have a bad turnstile or bearing in the upper strut??  
It is more annoying than anything but would like to fix it.  

A fellow PCA member suggested turning up the radio and no Jim I will not 
trade the car in, at least not yet.  Any suggestions????

Reagrds,
Bill

Noticed everyone else is providing the cars they own thought I'd do the 
same.
