Howdy,

Paul, Mark and I are back from Bremerton.  We had a hoot.  I'll post the
times, etc. on the web page later today or tommorow (still recovering from
an exhausting weekend).  We drove a total of 690km this weekend, plus we
did 500km+ last weekend!  Both times, we were physically fine after such a 
long trip.  Driving through Washington is pretty fun, they drive at a decent
speed and the bumps, dips, off camber corners keep you nice and awake.

On Saturday, we attended the PCA event at Bremerton.  Two years (almost) ago,
Paul and I set the goal of being within 3 sec. of Bill Buetow.  I can finally
say that I think we've now reached that goal.  The next goal is to match his
times now, but we'll need to get a set of "R" rubber to try and close the gap
further.  The only bad part is, the closer we get to him and Glen, the less
likely they are to help us go fast :)

Saturday's course was a blast, Greg Fordahl designed two sections on the 
course where there was a small straight, then a 45 degree corner.  Paul and
I both ended up taking those flat out, with a bit of drifting and a bit of
countersteering to make it through in one piece.  That was a rush that was
hard to describe, kind of like driving flat out between two concrete walls
with the tail hanging out and the boost gauge pegged.

The times at the end of the times runs were something like this:
Bill Buetow          55.3 (BFG R1)
Glen Hernandez       57.5 (Kuhmo Victoracer)
Farzaan Kassam       58.3 (Potenza S-02)
Paul Buchmann        58.8 (Potenza S-02)

In the fun runs after, Bill went faster with a 54.9 I think it was, and Glen
also went faster, but I don't remember his time.  I did a 57.9 in the fun
runs and Paul did the same.

On Sunday (I'll keep this condensed to 944 stuff only), we did the Challenge.
I decided not to drive because I wanted to make sure the timing was done
quickly so some of the far travellers could get home at a decent time.  The
weather was unusual, rain one minute, sunny the next, torrential downpour
five minutes later.  It was hard to get a run to work on because the
conditions changed so dramatically.  In Novice class, the DSM's ruled, with
a 300hp 95 Eclipse coming out on top with a 60.0.  In Senior class, a women
took top honours with a 57.0 in a NA 944 (Roxanne, you listening?!) with the
next placed person with a 58.4 in a 944TS.  Pro class had an S2 doing a 
stunning 52.7 I think it was.

A total of 21 competitors took part.  It was nice to see even the big dogs
like Bill, Glen and Bill K. participating and giving it their all.  It made
the event even more special.

Paul's car suffered a "sudden death" on course in his second and last dry
run.  Luckily, he had our Service Manager from our dealer as passenger.
They pushed the car off the track and Stuart quickly diagnosed the problem
as the air flow meter and sorted that out.  Paul had taken my car to the
line when he saw his beast alive again and went back to get it.  During that
time, the torrential downpour arrived and left him with his first run time
as his only dry run, almost 6 seconds off Bill's time.

Over the next few days, I'll update the DSM/944 Challenge web site with the
finishing times, etc.  For those that attended, I thank you for making the
event a success and a fun time was had by all.

Farzaan.
Man, I love this car, 1200+km of driving in one week and 9 auto-x runs!
