As has been previously posted, all 968s were shipped with a set of plastic
ducting pieces to route air from the car's nose openings to the front rotor's
center areas.  This is a little fancier than the set-up on the stock S2 and
951 cars.  The parts are in the 968 fiche, and have 944 part number.  My
careful examination of a photo of Milledge's 1988 Escort Series factory Turbo
S shows some of these parts were shipped from Stuttgart on those cars as well.

If you buy all of the pieces from the dealer, it might total to $50 - 100, and
you'd have to fabricate a way to mount two of the pieces to your control arms
(the 968 arms have provisions for this).  I am not sure how effective it
is/was/would be for track use, but I think that the Cool Brake is an easier-
to-deal with cost-effective compromise for most street/track cars.

Of course if you could find an intact set of pices from a wrecked 968...
