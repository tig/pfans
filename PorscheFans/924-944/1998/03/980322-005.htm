>>I've heard there is NOT a horn adapter kit available for aftermarket (MOMO,
>>Personal, etc.) steering wheels for 944's/951's and that special plastic
>>parts and custom brass springs need to be fabricated.

I'm not going to bet my life on this but I don't think that it's true.  My
88 951's PO had installed an aftermarket MOMO steering wheel.  This wheel
had a horn button with spring, etc and a swiper to interface it to the
standard contact ring which comes with the airbag steering wheel setup.
HOWEVER, it was not connected and PO had a set of air horns connected to a
button on the dash.  I went back to the OEM setup so I can't say for sure
that it would have worked.  However, it was a "PorscheDesign" MOMO wheel so
I assume that it was made to work with most Porsche models.

P.S.  If anyone's interested, I've still got the wheel (mint condition)
$300/BO.  Buyer pays shipping.  This is the MOMO "PorscheDesign" model
which is no longer available. For pics, see
http://venus.datum.com/~gdowd/porsche.html

I've got a few other bits around as well.

Alpine model 7513 Cassette/CD Controller (detachable face)
- perfect condition (I've upgraded to 7831 CD player)
- includes manual, wiring diagram, harness adapter, faceplate carrier box)
- $250/BO buyer pays shipping

Colgan 88 951 bra
- used for 2 weeks (I've decided I don't like bras :-)
- has the front plate opening
- middle strap on bottom doesn't have the stiffener piece (don't know why,
I just tucked it in)
- $60/BO, buyer pays shipping

Door panels (both sides)
- 88 951 black
- with speakers, map pockets, arm rests and all hardware (I'm upgrading to
Turbo S 10 speaker)
- I know the edge of the paper cone on one speaker is shot
- $275/BO, buyer pays shipping
- (I may have the rear panels available also)

Rear carpet
- 88 951 black
- frayed around top edges (I bought another used)
- missing 1 snap
- $100/BO, buyer pays shipping

Headlights
- 88 951 stock (I upgraded to Hella H4s)
- $50 for both, buyer pays shipping

Most of these prices are just guesses.  If you have a reasonable offer, let
me know.  Don't bother trying to lowball it as I'd rather leave them in the
garage.
