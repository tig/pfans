The advise I got when I started was to autocross on the street tires the
first year.  I autocrossed at about 15 events on the street tires
(mounted on 15 inch phone dials).  I didn't get tires until my times
were about 1 to 1.5 seconds difference from the worst run to the best
run (counting fun runs too).  I chose R1s on 16 inch 7 & 8 wheels.  What
a difference.  I don't think I could have appreciated the difference if
I had started out with the R1s right away.  I probably would have flat
spotted them by the 3rd or 4th event.

I chose the Koni adjustables.  A definite improvement but not as
dramatic as tires.

Let us know how it works out.  Good luck
