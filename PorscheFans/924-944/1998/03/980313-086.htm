All,
The discussion of oil cooler seal leakage and the replacement thereof
occasionally pops up on this list.  I've just decided to change the seals.
Occasionally I get some blackish stuff that looks kinda like oil, but there's
just so little of it I can't tell for sure.  My guess is it's either the oil
cooler seal or the headgasket.    I never see any indications of water in the
oil, so this would tend to point at the headgasket.  However, considering that
the oilcooler seal is MUCH easier than a headgasket, I think I should atleas
do that before tracking the car on the 29th.  

This started as a request for the price of the seal kit, and turned into a
rant.  Sorry guys.  Any comments/suggestions greatly welcomed.
