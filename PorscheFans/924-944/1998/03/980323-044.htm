Hi, Jay,

As for my post, I wasn't flaming someone for giving advice about working
on their own car.  I was flaming someone for giving BAD advice about
working on their own car.  Like most of the list members, I can't afford
to let someone else work on my Porsche, but I can't afford to blow it up
by my own hand, either.
