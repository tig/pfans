I just repaired and repainted the driver's side quarter on my 944. You
will never get a "perfect" match for any paint more than a couple of
years old. The local PPG dealer used that spectrum analyzer on my gas
cap and made me up a pint of something close. You have to "blend in"
panel repairs for them not to show. Most body shops won't take the time
to do it right. To blend in the quarter, you have to spray the quarter
with color but also half the door and half the rear panel. They you wet
sand the all three and then shoot clear over all three. The granual
blending of the old and the new fools the eye. Done right you cant tell.
