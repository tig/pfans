P-Fans,

I have a 87 924S that the wipers do not move.  The wiper motor runs but
the wipers stop halfway up the cycle.  It appears to be a missing tooth
as if I move the wiper 1/2" up the cycle the wiper catches and the cycle
completes until halfway up the next cycle.  My question since I have not
received my manuals yet.  Is their a gear or rack that can be replaced
(cheap) or is this an entire assembly (expensive and typical) and what
is the procedure for repairing this.

Second question is a squeal in the rear brake.  This is only in the rear
right brake.  Here is what is odd.  The squeal is only apparent during
mild to normal braking it disappears during hard braking.  It does not
sound like the wear indicators either.


Thank You,

Matt Knehans
