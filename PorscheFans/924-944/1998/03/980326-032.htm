Hi Bill,

I guess I should have worded that a bit differently. I think that time
trialing (or Solo I as the SCCA calls it) is just fine as a sport. But
it shouldn't be confused for DE. I think the vast majority of people
would be much more comfortable doing DE than TT. (Sounds like we are
trying to talk about sex in front of the kids...)

But if you are going to get involved in TT, I'd definitely recommend
getting a roll cage and a drivers suit. And I'd go into it with the
attitude that you may have to write off your car if you do have an
incident. If it is your only way to get to work I wouldn't do it.
