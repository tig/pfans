A little over a week ago I bought my very first Porsche and I am
completely exstatic.  Now though I need to take care of a few odds and
ends and am in need of advice.  
	First off I need tires, my rear tires are almost bald.  I'm looking to
spend about $200 for a set of rears.  Now I know that there are billions
of opinions on tires, and I want to know what you, the 944 guru's have
to say on the matter.  Right now I have AV1 Yokohama's and they do
pretty good.  They are 215/60/15.  Can I possibly go up to 225/55/15? 
I'm just trying to find out my options and which tires seem to work best
on these cars.
	Secondly my gauge that reads Water Temp and Gas Level is acting funny. 
Both read lower than they really are.  The Temp never gets to the first
bar line and the gas never goes up to the 4/4.  both gauges will fall
about a cm below the indicated range though.  Do I need a new gauge or
can it be repaired?  
	Alright there is a third thing.  My radiator has a small leak, can it
be repaired or do I have to buy a whole new one? thanx.
