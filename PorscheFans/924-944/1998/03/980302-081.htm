I was checking the fit of my "new" water pump
that I bought from Vertex several months ago
and discovered that the impeller size was
bigger than the old one.

Old water pump casting P/N: 944.106.124.3R -
smaller brass impeller.
"New" casting P/N 944.106.124.2R -  larger
plastic impeller.

I am assuming that the old pump is a newer
design than the "new" pump but wanted to try
and confirm that.  I could modify the block
to the "new" chamber size very easily if the
plastic impeller is a design improvement.
Can anyone confirm which design is the
latter.

Related question:  The plastic fitting on the
water pump that connects to the water line
from the turbo or turbo pump (I can't
remember) was not the open version and of
course there was no turbo thermostat.  Did
they make turbos with this line blocked off?

As always any advice is greatly
appreciated....

Darian
