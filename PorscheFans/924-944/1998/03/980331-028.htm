Hi,
	A few weeks ago I had Koni Sport Shocks installed
in the S2.  (The car has 67k miles, of which I put on 30k),
the ride is vastly improved (the car doesn't have M030).
The koni part numbers are 8741-1237 (front), and 8040-1035 (r)

The rears are set to the middle, and fronts set at full soft.  It
is firmer than before, and on rough roads the CD skips, where
before it never skipped.  I think there is more road noise,
although this might not be true.  The steering is much more
responsive, and overall I would highly recommend this.  I drive
the car everyday there isn't snow on the ground, and the shocks
made the car much more enjoyable to drive.

(Other things done to the car in the past, 968 M030 bars front and
rear, 7-9 X 17 993 rims)  Still have the stock springs.
