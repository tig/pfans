I am planning on buying a 924 turbo this summer so now I am doing
research about them.

I have two questions for everyone out there.  The first is about wheels
and the second about increasing the power output.  I am going to buy
either an '80 or '81 American spec.  931.

Okay,  I want to put some high quality tires on my car.  I am debating
between the Michelin Pilot mxx3's or Pirelli P-zero's.  What are the
opinions on these tires?  Does anyone think that a different tire would
be better?   I want very good to excellent dry traction with at least
reasonable wet traction.

Also, how large of wheels will easily fit on a 931(little or no
modification)?  I was thinking 16" wheels possibly 17" if it is
practical.  Part of the reason for this is that I would like to get a
tire aspect ratio of 50 or less preferably 45.  This brings up another
point, if the tires aren't the same diameter can the speedometer be
easily adjusted to read correctly?

What about the width of the wheel?  The car comes stock with 15x6 inch
wheels, right?  From what I have seen a you can't buy tires for a 16 or
17" wheel that are only 6 inches wide, so I would have to go to at least
7 inches probably 8".

My other questions have to do with increasing the horsepower of the car.

The 931 was not intercooled, correct?  That is one upgrade that I am
interested in so does anyone have hints as to where to buy the parts,
does any company make a kit for it, and would the intercooler of a 944T
work on a 931?

I also saw an ad in European Car once for a company that sells complete
exhaust kits (headers through the muffler) for many cars.  Does anyone
know about a kit for a 924 turbo?  Or just a company that sells quality
headers for a 924 T?

Are there any other modifications that are people would recommend to
increase the power of a 924 T?

Please comment on one or all question I brought up.

Thanks in advance to all replies,
