Well, I took my newly acquired 944 into the shop yesterday to have some
maintenance done.  The balance shaft belt broke on the way, too (odd thing
was I felt no extra vibration afterwards...  Shouldn't I have?).  Anyway, I
told the mech I wanted a belt and water pump job, and the seals if they
looked like they were leaking.  His opinion after seeing the pump was that
it looked fairly new, no signs of leakage, but the timing belt on the other
hand was in such bad shape he could rub the teeth off with his finger. 
Yikes!  But anyway, he suggested not doing the water pump.  Unfortunately,
the seals in that area (cam & ballance shaft?) were leaking a little.  Just
a little.  But I just switched the car over to Mobil one from a natural, so
the leakage may end up worse.  I'm having trouble deciding whether or not I
should have him go in and do the seals, and while he's got everything out
of the way, go ahead and do the water pump.  His rates are pretty
reasonable ($45/hr for the labor, plus $175 for the pump), but well, money
is still money and I don't mind saving some.  

What does the collective suggest?  Should I have him do the seals and pump,
just the seals, or wait on both (to do the seals later would be around $300
as opposed to $200 now that he has the belts off and all)?

Until yesterday, I was impressed with the PO's care.  But now, bah.  I
can't believe the mech I had inspect the car before purchase missed the
condition of the belts, and that the front rotors were 3mm thinner than
spec!  Front pads were 85% gone, and the previous mech never mentioned them
either.  Goes to show, you don't always get what you pay for (the mech, I
mean, I still think I got a good deal on the car).

Thanks for any input,
