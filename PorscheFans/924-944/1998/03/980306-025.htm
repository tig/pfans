I believe that GATSO refers to roadside mounted cameras that are triggered
by vehicles passing by at excessive speed. A photo and fine duly follow in
the post since the photographed registration plate can identify the driver
and home address.
The problem is that the film has to be changed manually and often they have
run out of film when you trigger them.(possibly not a problem).  It can be a
sweaty few days waiting to see if the postman delivers. Here in Dorset, UK
they are often set up at weekends on fast roads to deter high speed bikers.
The problem of the film running out has been solved by using high resolution
digital cameras with that are linked directly to police HQ, you could get
the fine by the next post!
If these are not GATSO then I apologise and I don't know what GATSO is, nor
do I know what these cameras are called.
