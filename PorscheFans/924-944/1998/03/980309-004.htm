Experienced a similar problem with disastrous results:

My father had a 1986 951 which had the Fuel Return Line Hose replaced
under warranty due to the recall.  On Columbus Day, 1991, my father's
car started smoking on the way home from work and then the engine
compartment fireballed.  My father was fortunate enough to escape
unhurt but the car was a total loss.  The cause of the fire was traced
to the fuel return line hose.  Porsche had replaced the faulty hose
with another faulty hose!!!

My point is, PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL AND HAVE YOUR CAR TOWED TO YOUR
MECHANIC!!  To be on the safe side, I would not even start the car as
spark and gasoline do not mix well outside of a cylinder head.
