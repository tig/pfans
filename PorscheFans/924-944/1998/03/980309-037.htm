$9K if it has maintenance records, +/- $1K depending on how well
maintained mechanically.

The car has low mileage but will need belt job at 30K ($600), water pump
at 60K + belts again ($1000), clutch at say 60K ($1300). Check control arm
balljoints for play at full lock to lock, parts are $200/side + labor. New
cam cahin tensioner guides at 60K ($400 + labor). Read the 944 FAQ for
other common maintenance items. If the above is taken care of my
experience is you could spend $200-300/yr.

Cars are for driving, especially Porsches. I do keep a 2nd car for winter
and in case of S2 breakdown. But usually its left uninsured and is worth
less than $3K.

BTW the S2 is a great car and hasn't emtpied my wallet!
