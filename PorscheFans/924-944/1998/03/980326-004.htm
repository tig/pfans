Randall:

I received an e-mail from Ralph on the Turbonetics wastegate which I
am reposting below.

In addition, I've been communicating with Jim Richmond who is looking
to use a dual port unit from a Grand National builder who has an
excellent reputation (my roommate/mechanic used them to help build his
700hp GN race/street car and confirmed this as well).  I have the
e-mails archived and a fax Jim sent from this company with a
picture/description.  Send me your fax # and I'll shoot you a copy. 
Price is $280 for the wastegate plus about $25 for gaskets, etc..

Good luck!

I have mounted the manual regulator in side...next to shifter...this
allows me to "dial" a specific boost pressure at any given time...I like
the fact that I can controll the pressure especially in certain racing
situations...NOW...not everyone thinks as highly as the Turbonetics
product as I...I use their DeltaGate II...I had to request a lighter
spring (normal is 9 pounds) because of my set up...mine is 5 pounds
  
> 2.  What type of wastegate do you have, single or dual chamber/port?

You might want to clarify this w/Turbonetics...I have one valve/chamber

There was some minor mods needed...nothing difficult...pipe bender and
welder
 
> 4.  Are you aware of any wastegate "creep"?  What kind of boost levels

The settings start...for me...@ 12 lbs (regulator fully closed)...I have
dialed in as high as 20 lbs...not for long...the way we have the car set
up...15-17 pds w/ the new MAFS provides for one hellava ride.

> 5.  Finally, HOW MUCH???

Approx. $500?
