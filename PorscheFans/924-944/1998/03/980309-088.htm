As far as your power antenna is concerned,It is a very intelligent move to
replace the unit entirely as opposed to removing/replacing the mast. My
experience is that a tired motor will quit as soon as extensive testing is
over with the new mast. The radio can be turned over to the ignition switch
and will operate without a problem but the catch is that Porsche already
thught of this and for some reason left a spot where a relayt should go
without filling it in with sufficient electronics. Call up Dave Aase or george
with 944 ecology for more info. The relay should be located on the side of the
heater box and I beliee that all the post 85.5 cars had it.

Now for my questions....
Well here goes another wet season of Arizona's monsoons and I want to be
prepared. I have a small water leak in the passenger rear seat. Sunroof seal
is recently replaced and IS NOT the culprit. the water is appx 6 inches wide
and a pretty thick puddle  Does Porsche design cars that defy the laws of
Physics (aside from the suspension system) and If so, how does water travel up
to the carpet while my car is parked outside.???

Also I have a certain problem with the clutch.... While parked uphill (on a
driveway) and left in first gear after killing the motor,I go to restsrt the
car and the clutch slave does not seem to engage...
 Everything seems okay except that with the emergency brake off, the engines
idle is lower (from pushing an un budging transmission and forcing the clutch
to slip like mad). First gear will not let go until you let the engine down
the hill and force the transmission to budge. Then you smell the terrible
scent of clutch permiate the cabin and your wallet starts to sweat. Really
pisses me off!!! This has occured twice already and don't want to know when it
Breaks.

Also, If you are still reading this I commend you for your patience and hope
you can provide your local list addict who has all the options codes and their
meanings to decipher this one: c77 423 946
and paint code: LM1Y/LMIY                  Please E-Mail rude944@aol.com and
TIA
