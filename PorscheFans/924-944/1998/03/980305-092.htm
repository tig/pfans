Hello Porsche Fans,
  I need some help with deciding which car to buy, can you help? Let
me explain my situation to you so you could understand the situation
I'm in and help me with some advice. I'm 21 years old and I am
currently going to a community college while living at home with my
parents (saves a lot of money compared to moving out). I currently
drive an '86 Ponticrap (Pontiac) 6000LE with an automatic transmission
and I HATE automatics. Before that I drove a '72 Ford Courier, a small
pickup truck but at least a manual, that was my dad's. The Pontiac and
the Ford are owned by my parents, they pay the insurance, gas,
everything. I want my own choice of a car now and will buy it myself.
I love manual transmissions and I really love sports cars so I've been
searching for a good car to get that proves to be reliable, safe, gets
decent gas mileage, and is in the $10,000 range, yet sporty,
comfortable, and with pretty good power. I first saw an '89 Toyota
Supra Turbo with a removable top at a local dealership and I checked
it out. I got a crazy idea to test drive it and they let me! It was my
first test drive and it was awesome. I went easy at first because it
wasn't my car then the salesperson said I could give it a little more
gas. I did and and it took off while making a really great sound! I
loved it! It had a great feel and performed to my expectations. I
ended up not buying it because I haven't found a job yet. That was the
first sports car I drove and I've been hooked ever since. I knew I
wanted a sports car before but now I really know I have to get one.
SPORTS CARS RULE!! Weeks later, I test drove an '85 Nissan 300ZX that
was naturally aspirated and had T-tops. It sounded great too and had
good power for a 3.0 liter. I loved its feel too. Still without a job,
I can't get it yet. This jobless thing might test patience but I
learned, "This is a good time to test cars out to get the feel of them
and to get background information and performance numbers and specs."
I somehow came across the idea of getting a Porsche 944. I love
Porsche and would like to someday get a new 911Turbo so I thought it
would be great to have my first car (that I own) be from the legendary
Porsche company!
  So I decided I wanted a late 80's early 90's sports car and I am
thinking along the lines of the Porsche 944, Nissan 300ZX, and the 3rd
gen. Toyota Supra, each in turbo or nonturbo configurations. I would
like to get a turbo though because I like their extra power while not
affecting gas mileage too much if you stay in the lower rpm range. I
am wondering, do turbos worsen reliability or are much more expensive
of a risk?
  I would like your opinion on each of the cars I listed with or
without turbos and any other possibilities to consider. I like and
respect all three companies and especially their respective sports
cars so its hard for me to decide.(After I buy the best choice I would
like to and probably will end up buying the other two!) Could you also
tell me if a used 944 would be too expensive to keep maintained and if
it would have a lot of expensive maintenance to do? I'm wondering if
it is a much higher risk than getting the 300ZX or the 944. My dad has
rebuilt the Courier's engine twice and has worked on a few other
things but has to take major problems to a mechanic, would he be able
to work on it or is it a pretty complex engine? I also have had a
brother that has worked on some racing engines but they are american
and he doesn't have a lot of time to spend.I have another a brother
that is currently going to Universal Technical Institute in Phoenix,
Arizona studying to be a diesel and auto mechanic. Would they be able
to work on it? Please help with what you can.

Thank you so much for your time and help,

Brian
'98 911GT1 (I wish)
'87 959 (just kidding!)
