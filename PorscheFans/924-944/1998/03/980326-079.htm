I agree with Farzaan in general:

"CHIPS: As far as the Milledge chips producing more power, etc.  Boost is
power. If the Milledge chips use even 1psi more boost, then it will create
more power.  To properly compare chips, the same method of boost control as
well as the same pressure must be utilized.  I'm not saying they don't
work, I have not tested them (read the above about trying to buy a set
of chips), but once again, it's hard to compare chips unless they are on
the same car with the same boost control method.  Look at the vast difference
in power and torque curves in my dyno test when we went with the drilled
valve over the bolt method."

HOWEVER:

There are two separate issues regarding boost.  One is maximum boost.  In my
'87, with four shims and a drilled cycling valve, my aux gauge says I max out
at 15-16 psi.  (Ah, you say, "how thick are those shims?")  In my '89, with
the AutoThority set-up and banjo bolt, I max out at the prescribed level,
under 1 bar (14.6 psi).  The other is partial boost.  Of course, boost and
power are related, although I don't think the relationship is linear.  Plus,
of course, other things affect the bhp of a motor.

It is really difficult to compare.  My knowledge of thermodynamics tells me
that there are far too many variables to deal with in a cost-effective way,
even when dynamometers are involved.  The pros spend tons of money working
these variables.  They argue about the differences between engine dynos and
chassis dynos, and other things.  I don't care about any of this.  I care
about how much fun my cars are to drive, and learning to drive better to have
even more fun.  I also care that my wife continues to enjoy the cars, so we
can keep spending this time together.  She can beat me in AX, as long as I
continue to kick her ass on the track.  All while having fun.

You see, there is bhp, there is torque, and there is drivability.  My '87 car
is much more drivable than the '89.  I love both, but I have much more fun
driving on the street, and in AX and track events in the '87.  Do I get more
boost earlier?  Hard to say.  I have not dynoed either car.  Nor have they
been instrumented.  But there is a marked difference, beginning when the
throttle is just tipped in.  BHP is equivalent to money, not the hormonal
output of testes or ovaries.  I cannot/will not spend beaucoup dinero for bhp
without driveability.  One 951 I drove with 435 bhp was driveable.  The 993 tt
I drove was driveable.  For me, driveability is where its at.

I will let Bill Bechtold give the '87 a try in an AX to see what he thinks.

In general, I believe that people should stick with the proven Autothority and
Weltmeister products.  These other things are not for everyone, especially
anyone that competes against me on the track or in AX.

In the years before pfans, there was Pano, and there were (and still are) many
tech sessions run by PCA regions.  In one of the Up-Fixen der Porsche Pano
tech session/article compendiums, there is an interesting diatribe on
horsepower versus torque.

People are funny.  Car people can be very competitive.  I heard a story at the
track last weekend about two anal retentive Porsche racers/tuners who are both
famous having won AX and track champonships.  They were working on a car, and
had a contest to see who's battery powered drill was faster.

Brent Harnish, can you guess who they are?
