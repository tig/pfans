Just my 2.5 cents worth...

As far as if to use your rear fog light holes or not... HELL YES!! I say,
anything I can do to keep some schmuck from rear ending me in the fog (which
we get quite a bit of here in Seattle) I say go for it! Also, I saw in
Automotion's catalog, they want $30 for the proper snapi sockets and wire
taps to enable the rear lights. I went to my local Al's Auto Supply store,
picked up two "Universal Tail Light Sockets" for $1.99 each, and with a
little Dremel work on them to remove the little spring clip, they work just
the same. I then changed my 5w tail light bulbs to 10w as well as putting
10w bulbs in my new sockets and I have tail light to spare! Looks damn good
too. Not too bright to attract undue (Officer Friendly) attention, but you
can see them in fog just fine. Even in daylight, the taillights are easily
visible.

It also makes me visible longer to all the Integra GSR's and Eagle Talon's
as my taillights dissappear into the distance.
Ha ha ha ha! Sorry... there is still a bit of teenager in me. If anyone
needs details, let me know!
