Steve --

Stop rebelling, just do it, and give the rotors a "brake".  Grabbing a file
isn't that "voodoo". At least you don't have to saw slots in them.  I just
installed the orange Pagids and they're great (but too expensive).  BTW, if
you figure out how to make them stop squealing on light braking around
town, let me know.
