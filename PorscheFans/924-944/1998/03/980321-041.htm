        Well, Costco *finally* got my set of RE-71's in this week and I had
them mounted and balanced this morning. Given it is a weekend on Oahu, I
have yet to open the Blue Beast up beyond about 65 mph, but two things are
apparent so far compared the the old D40 M2's.

1.      The car runs noticably quieter and smoother. The RE-71's seem to
soak up road shock and rough pavement "vibration" much better than my old
D40 M2's at the same tire pressure (30 psi front, 36 rear).  I used to have
a bad drive train noise from the rear of the car that I thought could be
bearings (74,000 miles on the car) but the noise is now gone.

2. The car seems to be noticibly more precise in steering response.  I
almost seem to feel less tramlining, although the sizes are the same
(225-50-16's front, 245-45-16's rear).   Perhaps because the D40's were
getting worn? (scuffed badly on the outside fronts but not worn down to the
wear bars on any tire).  Or maybe because I subconsiously need to feel good
about spending $560 bucks?

        I plan on having a 4-wheel alignment done this week as the outer
edges of the front tires were noticibly more worn out than the inside
edges, and the rears were slightly cupped in the centers. At least I figure
it is a good idea to check the alignment now that I sprung for new rubber
all around. If there are other Oahu types on the list, do you recommend
anyone better than Lex Brodie for 944 alignments?
        I hope the traffic is cleared out by 5:30 P.M., so I can sneak back
alone on some of the twisties.

have a nice weekend,

Khal Spencer

p.s. To the guy who did the "horse sense" timing belt/idler job: I wish you
a lot of good luck--you might need it. I don't think you should assume
success after the first 50 miles. And 944 engines can get soooo trashed
when they blow a timing belt.
