Alright, I've held off on posting this because I don't want the flames
and whining from all the guys who own Porsche built turbos.  But here
goes.  A friend of mine (Mike Lee of High Gear Specialties) is the man
who invented the turbo charger systems for twin cylinder Ducati
motorcycles.  For many many years he has successfully (reliably) put
turbo's into everything from 350 V-8's to twin's.  (talk to a turbo man
about the difficulty in getting exhaust pulses out of twin).  I've riden
the Ducati and it's positively amazing.  NO turbo lag, and it's a twin. 
How?  He pressurized the airbox with turbo pressure and used a blow
through...blah blah blah...sounds like I know what I'm talking about
eh?  Nope, but I can regirgitate some of it and tell you from experience
this guy is talented.  Anyway, to the original reason for this
dribble....  He took a look into my Porsche one afternoon and declares
that putting a turbo in it isn't all that difficult.  He says without
the knock sensor of the 951 you'd have to limit your boost and only pick
up about 50% hp, which is not up to 951 specs, and would  cost about
$3000.  He offered to use my car as a test bed and complete the system,
but I'm not sure there would be any interest in it...since a 951 can be
had for about $2000 plus my car (better brakes, yada yada yada...shut up
951 guys).  So there it is...if anyone thinks such a system would be
worthwhile....let me know.  One benefit would be insurance cost.

85.5 NA and will most likely stay that way.
