>==================================

According to a 1988 factory brochure I have, the standard wheels on the
924S were 6Jx15 pressure cast alloy (phone dials?) with 195/65 VR 15 tires.
There is no optional wheel/tire mentioned.  The 944 and 944S are both
listed as coming with 7Jx15 pressure cast alloy with 195/65 VR 15 tires,
and the 944 Turbo came with 7&8Jx16 with 205/55 & 225/50 VR 16.  I don't
know what the factory "offset" is on these wheels.
"Performance" options listed in the same brochure consist of:
HD front & rear stabilizer bars; Sport shock absorbers; LSD; Forged alloy
wheels(does not list available sizes); ABS.
BTW, the standard stabilizer sizes were 20mm Front/18mm Rear for 924S, 944,
and 944S, and 22.5mm Front/18mm Rear for 944 Turbo.

Let me repeat, all of these "facts" are right out of the brochure, so don't
blame/flame me if any are incorrect.
