Hi Pfans, I have just gotten back from collecting my first 951 (one
owner, Guards Red on Tan, 91K) from Fresno CA (I live is Tucson AZ) :)
.......... If this is a dream don't wake me :) :)...... what a ride...
what a machine......

But I need to thanks some folks who helped.

First, my wife who week after week patiently searched the web
classifieds and the on-line Sunday Newspaper classifed sections till she
found this dream machine.

Second, all you Porsche fans who pointed me to good inspectors and by
your Q & A's and comments guided us in what to look for and what to
avoid. 

Third, Gary in Tulsa who intervened in a timely manner to prevent me
making a costly mistake in that fair city. Also Denny Kahler of Kahler's
Porsch in Dublin CA. and Bill Raider of 'On the Edge" in Colorado
Springs CO. who gave me thorough, articulate reports on potential cars.
They deserve support. 

Ok Ok I will keep it techinal from now on, but just wanted to share my
joy :)

Ray Yardy

88 951 Guards red on tan

PS.  Just looked through the old paperwork from the PO and found he
forgot one item about this car.... "S"  :) :)   Please don't wake me, it
must be a dream....
