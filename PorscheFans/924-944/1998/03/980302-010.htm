 How do you get the valves out of the 944 turbo head.  I tried the 
     c-frame type compressor and the over head type.  The c-frame I have 
     is just not rigid enough and the overhead won't work with the 
     double springs.
     
     I started looking thorough all my tool catalogs for a better tool.  
     I found a "heavy duty" C-frame compressor in the Sears Industrial 
     Catalog.   For those P-fans who have a compressor that works, where 
     did you get it.
     
     Also, any body had head machining done in the Cincinnati-Dayton 
     are, recommendations?  I may just take this to the pros and let 
     them get these puppies out.
     
     TIA,

Hi Hay-

I've got a valve spring compressor your welcome to try.  I think it's the same
one you referred to in your posting.  It's worked well on a number of VW, Audi
and Porsche heads. Never done a 951 yet, though.  If you have the head off,
bring it to West Chester and we'll try it.

PS. - I have a 951 too, but never had the head off - yet!
