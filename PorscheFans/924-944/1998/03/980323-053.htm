Hi,
It is time for a new set of tires for my car. Should I go for the 
S-02 or the MXX3.

I attend about 7 low heat( no hard core competiton) track sessions 
per year and do not want to change to slicks every time. Sessions 
only last about 12 laps. No autocross.

I understant that S-02 do not have stiff enough side walls and I have 
seen a lot of them at the track badly worn on the outside edge.
Good for the street ride though.

This is what I would like  to get from the tire. Most important on 
top.

1. Tires  should loose traction in the dry at the limit gradually not 
     just snap oFF.
2. Rain performance is not important.  
3. I enjoy more drifting and balancing the car than trying to squeeze
   THe last 1/10 of a second per lap from the car.
4. Tires should last at least one season  with a bit of 
    overdriving. 
5. Look is not important.
6. Street ride quality would be a nice bonus. I am a little afraid 
    of  the MXX3 , their sidewall is so much stiffer then S-02.

Car camber -1 DEG front
           -1.5 DEG rear, street and track

Thanks for the help.
