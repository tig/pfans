Ok, here's where I disagree. First, I am not sold on getting the tool , =
yet, simply because the professionals are probably better at checking for=
 other problem areas while they are tensioning my belts. I still may get =
the tool, but so far have not for this reason. But even for the amateur =
mechanic the cost is not prohibitive relative to what you will spend havi=
ng the Porsche mechanic use it. Figure every 30k miles you will have the =
belt checked/tensioned 3 times. Once when new, again for retension and =
then again at 15k. Then the cycle starts again. This will amount to about=
 6 hours of labor at $60+ per hour, or $360+. If you do the work yourself=
 you have paid for your tool, actually, 15k miles after the initial new =
belts are installed. This is easily within one year for daily drivers. =
And if you sell your car the tool retains most of its value so basically =
you've rented the thing and made money!  Ha!
