zwerner@... Find out what welding rod type or combination the guy uses so I can duplicate that here please.please please
Mine looks just like yours,missing an ear.

I also have a second head that both ears and the spark tube is cracked away 
If your folks in indy can fix that I'd send it to them.

Let me who in Chicago is fixing your cams I have 3 out of 4 to do...
I had shipped them to Deano at SMR in Mundelein Ill. had he sent them back unable to 
help me (thanks for trying Deano)

Of the 3 bad cams all are missing teeth 30% to just a couple of teeth
Just purchased 2 more cams thinking I was out of luck so let me know how yours go

I need one head to put my S back on the road but If anybody wants to save me the time and trouble 
of rebuilding the second of 2 944S heads I'll sell'em off as "some assembly required" just e-mail me 
directly at fuzz@socketis.net

Don't know the composition, but I'm taking mine over to Brian Stewart in Indy next 
Fri., to have mine welded up. I only lost one ear on the mount, and Brian says he 
has a shop over there that can fix it better than new.... Indy is the racing capitol 
of the mid-west, and they have specialty shop that can fix anything....  Brian has 
been head mechanic for Porsche factory racing both in US and Europe, as well as F1 
and Indy Car. If it can be fixed, he knows how to have it done !!!! I'll try to get 
back to you with more info.. How's your cams ?? I've got a shop in Chicago that's 
putting new gear on mine. Only had a brokken tooth on the exhaust cam, but having 
both done..... Much less expensive than new or used .
