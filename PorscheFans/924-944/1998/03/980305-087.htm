I discovered a source for 951 caliper seals two years ago, and have posted to
this list several times.  Since then, some of you have also discovered
Truechoice in Hilliard, Ohio will sell the seals as separate items.  You must
specifiy the diameter of the pistons and they will sell you just the seals.
Of course, I discovered this after buying the factory kits w/ pistons from my
dealer, and yes, Carlsen is an excellent choice for dealer parts.

Now I take my old pistons as spares, plus an extra set of seals whenever I go
to the track.  Not that I would ever do this but...

A friend with a heavily-modified RS America was testing all day at
Buttonwillow, on a Friday before a time trial weekend.  He actually went
through a front pad and melted piston/backing plate material together.  He
scraped off the piston and drove the rest of the weekend, but now I carry my
spare pistons for others like him...
