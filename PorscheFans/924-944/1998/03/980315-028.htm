Just a word of thanks...

At the beginning of the year I decided it was time to add an alarm to the P=
orsche.  I
shopped around and found the custom install alarms were VERY expensive and =
decided to
purchase an alarm from a discount store(mail order or actually ordered from=
 the internet)

It arrived and I started looking for some professional to install it and co=
uld not find one
(Liabilities and responsibilities etc etc).  I decided to do it myself.  Ar=
med with workshop
manuals wiring diagrams etc I tackled the job.  Only I really soon had to d=
iscover the the
wiring diagrams and the workshop manual did not really help much.  That is =
when I turned
to the list.  

I would really like to thank everybody that has given me advice over the la=
st two
months.  Thanks to you I now have an alarm in the vehicle that lock and unl=
ock the doors
when armed/disarmed.  The drivers door can be set for valet mode during par=
king, when I
arm the alarm it will close the sunroof and any open windows automatically =
and there is a
few other stuff as well....

Again this would not have been possible without the help of everybody on th=
is list

THANKS very much

Leon
