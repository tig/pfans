>Anyone have any experience mounting woofers in the rear wells of a 944 ?

I have a single 8" in my passenger size rear well.  There are pretty much
two ways to do this: 

1) Make a custom box that fits the well.
  pros: Cheaper
  cons: secured in place in such a manner that accessing the
tail/brakelight wires in the well becomes a major inconvienence.

2) Use dynamat to reduce the volume of the well to the spec'd Va for your
sub.  Then make a new cover for the well (from fiberboard, plexi, whatever)
that can be tightly secured, to which you will attach the sub.
  pros: Can easily be removed/pushed-aside to access wires, etc..  In my
opinion it's also accousticly superior to #1 given the characteristics of
the fender wells
  cons: Dynamat ain't as cheap as fiberboard.

Either way, make sure you waterseal the well beforehand.  Seen people who
hadn't, and ended up with very yucky fiberboard after a good rainstorm.

Any respectable audio shop should be able to do either method for you.  I
initially picked up the dynamat idea from a Good Guys store.  They say it's
very popular for the new Camaro's and Trans Ams (?), which I guess have
similar storage areas.  I tihnk they quoted me $160 for the dynamat &
labor.  That included hooking up the sub to an amp under the passenger
seat.  I was just talking to them them for ideas, though, and did it myself
with little trouble.

I believe there should be enough room in the passenger side well for a 10"
sub as opposed to my 8", but I would definately go with the dynamat for
that route.  (making a box for that volume in that shape is going to be
sloppy, IMO).

My suggestion is to jsut go to an audio shop where you know the reps are
friendly enoguh fellas (or ladies), and tell them you're just looking for
suggestions and a quote.  They should be more than happy to assist.  They
may come up with something better than what I mention.

Another option is making a large low-profile carpetted box that looks
indiscrete enough on the floor of your hatch.  You could reasonably fit two
12" in a low-profile box, I think, given the area you hae to work with.
