Two problems/questions with my '91 S2:

1. The climate control temperature setting works perfectly. But the
air-vent redirection does not work. Regardless of slider positions the
air is split between the defrost vents and main (and side) vents. No air
at the foot-well vents. How do the redirection vents work, and where are
the servos for these controls located? Anybody solved this problem?

This strikes me as an example of over-engineering, dead of
overcomplication at 36k miles! My '84 944 has the exact same
functionality with independent 3-way control of air direction, and the
slider flaps work great after 14 years and 107k miles!

2. The brakes won't ever release completely. The pads are new (1300
miles) Jurids, and they squeak and squeal continuously, louder when I
use the brakes. The noise does not bother me when I actually brake -- my
'84 has done it with Jurids and Mintex -- but I don't want to wear the
pads and rotors by just driving. On gentle slopes the car does not move,
so the binding is probably wasting some power as well, besides the
unnecessary wear. The brakes and clutch were flushed and bled this
weekend without any change. No symptoms of a bad master or slave, just
the overenthusiastic brakes squeaking anytime the car moves. ABS works
fine. TIA.
