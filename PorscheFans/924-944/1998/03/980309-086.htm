s.
Does anyone on the list understand exactly how the dual chamber is an
advantage
over the stock wastegate.  I've had people tell me the stock wastegate wi=
ll
work fine and I've had people tell me I need an aftermarket wastegate.  I=
'm
sure I'm going to try the stock wastegate first(what have I got to lose)
with
my GReddy Profec.

This is the line I can't understand:
 "When the boost pressure gets close to blow off or there is a pressure
wave
spike then the wastegate valve lifts off the seat and starts chattering."=


  What does the stock setup do with the stock wastegate when the boost
pressure
gets close to blow off or there is a pressure wave spike?  Do these same
conditions not exist without a boost control?  There is also boost limit =
in
a
stock situation, it just varies under different loads.  I've got a feelin=
g
I
will end up having to go with a dual chamber wastegate and I would like t=
o
understand why.
<

Randy,

Someone else can fill in the missing details but this is what I understan=
d
the difference to be.  The single chamber wastegate (stock) consists of a=

valve on a seat held up with a spring and a single chambered diaphram on
top.  One side of the diaphram can be pressureized by manifold pressure a=
nd
the other side is vented to the atmoshphere.  The exhaust is pushing
against one side of the valve and against the pressure of the spring.  Wh=
en
the maniforld pressure reaches approx one bar positive pressure, it force=
s
the valve open by pressurizing the diaphram that is attached to the top o=
f
the valve.  This opens the valve and releases exhaust pressure, the turbo=

backs off, the manifold pressure drops and the valve closes.  This can
happen in a cycle or frequency multiple times per second.  The hot exhaus=
t
on one side of the valve and the constant opening and closing can burn or=

warp the wastegate valve.  Once this happens, the spool up time is slower=

because the valve is leaking.

On the dual chamber unit, there is pressure on both sides of the diaphram=

which is controlled by the controller.  A plug type valve is held shut by=

both a spring and chamber pressure.  When the predetermined amount of boo=
st
is reached the pressure in the chambers changes letting the exhaust bleed=

off.  The dual unit is controlled by the pressure differential between th=
e
chambers rather than manifold pressure.  This is where I got lost on the
explanation.  =


Bottom line, the GReddy controller will work on the stock wastegate but n=
ot
any better than the stock system.  Have the guy you are buying it from gi=
ve
you a complete explanation of how and why it will work.  When the rest of=

the explanation on the dual chamber gets pounded into my head, I will pos=
t
it.
