I want to thank everyone who responded to my earlier post regarding the
924 cylinder head. I now have sufficient information, so no need to
waste further bandwidth. For those who inquired about the reason for
using the earlier head, I was fortunate enough to buy a head with new
valves and cam installed for about $140 from another list member. Since
my head needed valve seals, at least one new valve and some other work
it seemed to be a good deal. There was some question about
interchangeability which was cleared up by list members. Again, thanks a
lot!
