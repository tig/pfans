You stated that your mechanic recommended changing synthetic oils at
2.5k intervals...............!?

A well maintained and running engine does fine on dino oil occasionally
changed at 5k intervals.   Truly obsessed porschephiles may change
synthetics at 3k, but to suggest 2.5k is a new record.    Why don't we
just pipe in an automatic drip system where the oil is constantly
changed (like the oiler system on some Mercruiser I/O lower units)?.

Considering the fanatical care most of us take with our cars, and the
relative light duty, 2.5k interval is just creating revenue for the
manufacturer.   It's also interesting to me that VERY few people can
credibly point to 'oil breakdown' as the reason for engine failure.

I think your mechanic engaged his ego ahead of sense to suggest changing
oil in that interval.   Due to the nature of internal combustion
engines, it is part of the design to handle the contamination and
blow-by of operation - it's NORMAL!

I expect some flaming here.....and wrapped myself in asbestos......but
I'll stick with good ol' solid maintenance practices which include
regular oil and filter changes, but somewhere closer to 5k intervals.
