Hello Everyone!

Couple of questions....

After polishing off 3600 miles in ten days, my '86 951 developed a 
couple of very minor problems. I'm seeking your advice before I take it 
to a porsche-specialist for a much needed oil change.

During the trip - here's what happened...

1) My windshield wipers would stop dead in their tracks when I 
disengaged them, rather than going back down to "start position".
Same thing happens engaging the mister. Normally you would just have to 
move the handle for a full cycle. Now when you do that it moves a bit 
then stops. Then you have to move it again, rather hold it up until it 
finishes the cycle, and hopefully you can time it to rest where it 
should. Inter wipers don't work at all.

What's the deal, here? fuse, relay, what? 

2) The internal digital clock, suddenly stopped working. I think it was 
attributed to the crappy stretches of highway that I ran over. Bad 
contacts, fuse, no idea. It was working just fine before, now nothing.

All your help and input would be greatly appreciated!

You can send your thoughts directly to mailto:jcarroll7@hotmail.com

I apoligize if these were addressed in early issues... haven't been able 
to read the list for the past three weeks.

By the way, she opened very nicely to 130 in a couple of stretches, WOW! 
Wouldn't think of trying to go that fast with my Corvette. Definately 
impressed.

Thanks again,

John
'86 BLK 951
