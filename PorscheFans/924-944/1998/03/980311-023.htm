I've seen this book and plan to get one... not that I'll ever own a 996,
but more as a collector's item and information.  FYI, these "technical
introduction" books typically sell out pretty fast and for whatever =
reason
Porsche doesn't make them available very long... the Boxster version is
already unavailable.

Side note for '89 944 Turbo owners: the technical introduction book =
"Turbo
Information Technik" for this car is still available, and is priced about
$11-12.  Order WKD 495 321.  Unfortunately, my S2 version is out of =
print.

Haven't seen this one.  Sounds good too, so I ordered it today.

Last week when I saw the 996 book it was $50!  It has since dropped to
about $20-22.  Why?  Who knows, but I'm happy.
