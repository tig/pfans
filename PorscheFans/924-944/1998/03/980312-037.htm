Chris,
      I am glad I did it the difficult way then! I agree, old 574 is very 
hard, and required razor blades to scrape it off in my case. Thanks for 
letting me know that it didn't work for you, I certainly don't want to wast my 
time with next repair and have to re-do it. Next time I use the stuff, I will 
try applying new 574 to old hardened 574 to see how long it takes to soften up.

Are you back on the road again? How did that head re-build work out?

Thanks,
 Ezra
