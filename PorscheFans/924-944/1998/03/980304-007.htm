There are even better than All-Weather Bulbs:

first of all: 

The All-Weather making 15% more Light than stock H4 Bulbs.
The Light is yellow to bitblue differs from the degree you are looking 
at it, but mostly yellow nearly like the french headlights.
They are made for BadWeather, because the reflexions are lesser than 
stock ones. They are build by Philips and the name is "Philips 
Allweather". You can get them in germany for DM 6,- 

When the Lights are off you the headlights are shining blue to violett, 
which is really cool, but as we all have 924-944 you won't see it. 

Better Bulbs: 

Bosch and Philips build newer H4 Bulbs (also allowed in Germany) 
They are called Philips Premium , i can't remember the Bosch name.  
They products 30% more light and it's brite white light. they have a bit 
amount of xenon gas in the inner bulb. They don't need more power or so. 
So amount of energy is the same like stock. 

The price of the Philip Premium is about DM 10,- 


IMHO the Premium are my favorite. I'm using them in my 924S and it's 
much brighter than before. Don't let you be fooled by Salesmen. They are 
really cheap!
