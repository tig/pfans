Hi Jay,
  Re. your note " I absolutely love my Porsche, and feel it is one of
the best sports cars on the planet, but there is nothing that seperates
it's timing belt system from any Toyota, Honda, Ford or any other car."

I love our 944 also but there is no comparison about timing belts on
Toyotas, we just put in our second timing belt at 185,000 only because
our mechanic felt guilty about charging so much for a clutch job so
he tossed in a timing belt. The one that he replaced still looked new
with 70,000 miles on it !! I still can't understand why the Porsche
belts stretch and wear so poorly, but I love it anyway !!!!!! My Toyota
is just a cheap commute vehicle. Oh, our '83 Ranger has 110,000 and the
original belt ! ( I know I'm pushing it with this one though !!) I do
about 90% of our vehicle maintenance but am just not comfortable with
some of the more involved mechanical procedures, so every now and then
I have to go to the shop.
