I believe the lancaster balance shaft concept originated elsewhere, however the
implementation on the 944 is Mitsubishi's, I believe the same design is used on
their 4 cylinder turbos.  (someone correct me if I've been mislead)

Anyway, it seems no one has mentioned that over tightening the timing belt
results in quick water pump failure.  The water pump (in our case) has to be a
point of consideration when tightening the timing belt.

If someones peace of mind equates to a $400 tool, so be it.  I had to quit
using the tool to measure my timing belt tension when I got the updated version
of the rear cambelt cover.  The tool's prongs no long fit between the belt
cover and the belt without putting tension on the timing belt.  Now I use the
the auto-tensioner, which makes the tensioning tool read 3.0. (measurement
taken prior to the new rear cover).  Just so people know, if you use the
auto-tensioner don't back off on the belt when you get to TDC, simply release
the tensioner and make sure it is moveable, then retighten it.  The $400 god's
gift to the world requires you to back off about 1 1/2 cam tooth prior to
measurement.  Prior to any use of either the tool or the auto-tensioner, get
the written instructions on how to use them.
