I was wondering, what is the average miles-run for a 951, is it capable
of running like 300.000 miles.
I use to drive a 83/944, and it seem to going forever, Back in time i
used to drive Audi Turbo, and that thing had 200k miles on the clock,
when I let it go, with the same engine. Will my 951 S do at least 200k
miles. Engine has 100k miles on it, and is in perfect condition.
Gearbox, transaxels are all brand new. I never drive hard when cold. I
do at least 20 k miles per year, but I suspect a lot people whould say I
drive hard, when warm !! 
I know for a fact that if you get more boost, you will off-course apply
more wear the the car (read 358 HP = new gearbox, transaxel, new
headgasket). I have been driving for a while with 250HP, and it seems
like it can last for a long time.

Whats the record for long time go with a 944/951 ?????

Final thing; IF i dare to put the stage2 chip in the box, is there any
way to make adjustable pressure on the Turbo, I mean normal driving with
250 HP, and when needed you can have like a secret 007 button, so you
can run with more boost, for a short run, or what ever it take to make
that M3 go away ???
