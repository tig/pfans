thoughts, so don't anyone slam me please... Isn't this list for 944
specific issues like tech questions or how to's ?<

My 2 cents: I pretty much agree with Don. A little chat is fine. But
some of the long stuff... ??

.... in my opinion the list shouldn't be reserved for just tech
questions. ... I truly enjoy reading the road stories ... And lets face
it no one, let me be clear, NO ONE reads the general, flamers, or tavern
list. Well ok maybe two of you. :-)  I really don't want to subscribe to
those lists on the off chance someone relates a 944 road story or joke,
etc.

I think that is just the point Joe. A road story/joke/etc is never
specific to 924/944. Any brand/make can be inserted. The general and
tavern sections are intended for such conversations. If no one reads
them, that is its own message.

To help cut down on the length of the list we could be more concise as
to how much we quote. Some of us have gotten a bit carried away with
quot
es

Ahmen!!

One final thought (almost a flame but I cant help myself). The worst
recent example: Tavern racing or whatever. I also, in my foolish youth,
did silly things just like that. But I dont think I would have posted em
on this list.
