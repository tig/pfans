OK, I'm not real fast yet, just to complicate the situation, I had a BFG
rep who races a 951 tell me to never let the pressures get over 30 psi hot
because the tires get greasy.  He also recommended setting rear pressure
higher than front, which is contrary to what the BFG R1 website recommends.
 I've tried his settings and they seem to work on my car, judged by the
fact that once I set the tire pressures hot after the first session, they
stay pretty consistent when measured after each session thereafter.  The
procedure is 22-24/F, 24-26/R cold, then setting to 28/29 F/R after the
first session.  I believe that this is dialing in a little oversteer, if
you buy into the idea that you decrease pressure to increase traction w/
the R1s.  It's my impression that these tire pressures are making the rear
tires do more work, and reducing pressure buildup in the fronts, but that's
just a guess.

I know other 944 drivers who set pressures at 24/22 F/R hot, which does
seem low, certainly much lower than what the BFG website recommends. But
they are fast!

My tires might have a slight "groove of doom", but not bad.  Guess the
bottom line is there are a lot of opinions on this subject, and I'm still
looking for the right combination.  At my lower level of skill, I can't
tell the more subtle effects of pressure changes, but I can tell when tires
lose it when the track gets hotter, and whether tire pressures are
consistent after each run.

Might be fun to get a summary of range of tire pressures used by PFans.
