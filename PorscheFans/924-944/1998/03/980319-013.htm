I have done the change to synthetics in the engines and transmissions of three
higher-mileage cars and haven't seen any problems with unexpected leaks.

I don't know why you are trying flush the old oil out. The synthetics that I
have used (Mobil and Valvoline) all say they are compatible with conventional
lubricants. Seems like you are wasting time, gas and washing all the surfaces
down only to increase wear when you start it up the first time.
