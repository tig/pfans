while i find your story rather amusing part of it bothers me greatly: 
it has to do with drinking and driving; every year in texas about 65% 
of all accidents and about 75% of all traffic related deaths occur 
because of stupid f*cks who think that two or three beers are 
okay...right now i have two friends who are in the hospital, their 
college careers on hold for quite a while (due to rehab) because some 
25 yr. old guy thought that 3 beers wasnt going to impair him, well 
he was wrong and he came head on into their Mustang...it is really 
hard to look across at empty desks because people are too stupid or 
proud to call a cab....your friends burn out is great (i love burn 
outs) but after drinking and while in route to another bar, he should 
have gotten a lot more than 1K bail and you should be so ashamed of 
your actions that telling 1800 other people should be the last thing 
on your mind, just think of it this way, he loses control, hits you 
who hits the other guy, all in front of a police officer...it could 
be a lot worse and because it isnt no one is going to stop what they 
(you) are doing...i hate to say this but sometimes bad things have to 
happen to people before they realize that their actions are just 
plain dumb...drive fast, burn out, take a turn a little 
sideways...but dont take one sip of alcohol then get on the road 
where you can hurt me or my friends...sorry this is so mean and 
pointed but i think there are about 1790 people here who will agree, 
that drinking and driving is just plain f**king stupid

19 and drinking (also walking or crawling)
