            Well, after two years of driving my 87 944S with the idle set
artificially high, and all the other idle speed aggravations that seem so common with
this model, I am beginning to get ready to start to go after the idle speed
stabilizer (thus using the new intake manifold gasket I bought in 1996).  Haynes has
the procedure for the 8v car, but the layout is not, obviously, identical.  I would
appreciate all comments and warnings.  Specific questions are:

            1. How exactly does one "unclip" the fuel injector plugs?
            2.  What are some tips for removal of and refitting the manifold gasket -
i.e. what materials should be used, and what should be avoided.
            3. Does the throttle body become accessible only when removed with the
manifold attached or does there exist a way of actually getting it off before the
manifold?
            4. When all the removal is done. does the manifold actually lift out, or
does it just become moveable enough to get at the stabilizer?
