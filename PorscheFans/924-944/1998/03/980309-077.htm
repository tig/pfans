Hello Joseph-

I can't tell you how much to pay for the car as it is usually a function of
what the owner feels the car is worth and what you feel the car is worth.
Somewhere in between is a price both buyer and seller see as fair.  As data
I can say that I have had my 90 S2 (86K mi) for 1 yr 3 mos. and it is my
daily driver.  I use it to commute to work (10 mi round trip) and any time I
need an attitude adjustment (distance varies....;-) ).  I purchased the car
with 73K on the clock for $12.5K 

I can tell you from personal experience that the car has the potential to
cost you no more than any other car.  Perhaps your friend wants to purchase
the car for himself.  In the span of ownership I have put on approx. 13K mi
of blissful motoring.  I will say that I do all my own oil changes (3K mi
intervals) and have put in a new set of brake pads and associated fluid
flush.  I also put in a new timing chain tensioner (very simple job) which
has been discussed as a major weak point in the 16V motors.  I have yet to
get the timing belt changed based on the 40K interval (don't worry
guys/gals, it was changed at 50K by the PO) but this is on the short list.
I'm tempted to try this myself, but I'm a little scared of the consequences
if I should botch the job.  Total cost for the car during ownership ~$800.00
(including buying a set of the shop manuals).  For me, this has been very
cheap thrills.

As for making the car a garage queen, well I can say one thing, don't.  Each
of the 944 variants (or should I say 924 variants) loves to be
driven...hard.  I just started auto-xing last year and have become addicted.
The car seems at its best when driven to its potential (not that I can drive
the car to its potential, but I'm learning).  Cars that are driven on the
odd occassion can tend to atrophy even if they look pristine.  I know that
my baby has a few more stone chips and more miles than when I first got her,
but each mile was great fun and every new chip is a time I've spent enjoying
the car.  I intend to use my car, not use it up.  

I know that many people will have differing opinions so these have been
mine.  I can say that you'll enjoy the car whether it being a daily driver
or a special occassion car.  Just remeber why you bought the car...to drive it!

HTH,
Riff
