Actually the best place for the locking lug nuts is the back of the shelf in
the furthest corner of the garage...preferably covered with an old oil
soaked rag....behind a case of oil you got cheap but will never use because
it is cheap. (on a shelf above eye level is even better).

Has anybody actually had their wheels stolen? Did they have insurance? Did
they then go out and buy better wheels than were stolen?
