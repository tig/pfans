Hi all,

Just a quick question, When my timing belt went on my old 924NA Euro the
valves had a close encounter with the pistons! Required a head rebuild.

Are the US 924 NA's different? If so has anyone got any details?

Sorry Stu don't mean to worry you.

Should be fairly easy to replace. You will have to check the crank possition
as well as cam, as the belt failed. Usually to replace one I lock the crank
with cam at TDC.

Regards 

Richard.
