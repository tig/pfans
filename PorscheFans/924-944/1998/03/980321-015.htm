<I too have a similar vibration. Mine is in the clutch pedal and shifter
<whether in gear or not, clutch in or out. Above 3000 rpm it disappears.
<The vibration is a bit more noticeable under load. Belts checked, clutch
<replaced, transmission partially rebuilt, and mounts replaced. It must
<be forward of the clutch but what ??? As far as I can tell it must be
<the flywheel. The vibration was reduced somewhat when the clutch was
<last changed and the flywheel was machined. I don't know what to do
<about this as serious investigation would require serious $$$$.

This describes exactly the situation I has on my 89S2 as well as all the
repairs to it.  A reputable Porsche specialist in STOW, MA, diagnosed
either a) a faulty balance shaft or b) a vibration damper, which is a
rotating pulley with a rubber core or so (??).  Both items are expensive to
repair and, as you said, forward of the clutch.  My clutch is new and
dropped not once but twice for inspection and fly wheel
balancing/replacement.  In mine vibrations peaked at 2700rmp.  Strange
thing is that it got better by itself to a large extent, maybe as the
clutch wore off, and now it is considered pretty much within the "normal"
reange for a Porsche.   I was told this is the way they run.  Don't touch
it.  My point of comparison is an Acura Legend, which is silky smooth.
