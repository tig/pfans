Joe,
Doesn't it seem appropriate that if the general, flamers, and tavern
lists aren't used much, then road stories be moved to those lists?
Isn't that the purpose for which they are designed?  (Subscribing
and
unsubscribing) isn't difficult.  In this manner, the 924-944 list
won't run the risk of losing the imput of Don Istook, Kevin Gross,
and other professionals.
In this way, it seems to me that those list members who want both
tech info and road stories will get both by subscribing to both.
Those who want only tech info will get only tech info by not
subscribing to the other lists.
If each group gets what they want, then I would imagine the posts
for all lists would be more relevant and improve in quality.
I, like you, enjoy both, and I am willing to subscribe to the other
lists in order to keep as much vital and experienced tech advice on
the 924-944 list from these Porsche masters as possible. I suspect
oftentimes we lose good tech advice simply because these P-car
masters don't have the time to read the list daily.
Thanks for focusing the issue--you bring up many points to think
about.  I wonder how many list members would agree to separate the
topics as outlined.
Best regards,
Lee  larchie@lander.edu

And lets face it no one, let me be clear, NO ONE reads the general,
flamers, or tavern list. Well ok maybe two of you. :-)  I really
don't want to subscribe to those lists on the off chance someone
relates a 944 road story or joke, etc.
