Tom,
    The factory spec is 4.0 +/-  0.3 for a new belt and 2.7  +/-  0.3 for a
previously run in belt.  That means 3.7 to 4.3 for a new belt and 2.4 to
3.0 for a previously run in belt.  The factory manual and Jim's Pasha's
article in the August 1994 issue of Excellence page 108 specifically state
the values above. The 2.4 to 4.3 value is an initial run-in control value
and is not the factory spec. used for checking and  retensioning the belt.
This is clearly stated in the table on page 108 of Jim's article. The
control value is used as a reference for the tension during initial run-in.
It means that the initial belt tension should not be more than 4.3 and
should not fall below 2.4 during the initial run-in period (first 2000
miles). Based on the factory specs from the manual and Jim's article, the
tolerance for a new belt is +/- 7.5% and for a used belt +/- 11.1%.  If Jay
was within 15% of the factory spec adjusting the belts by hand, that means
the tension could have been anywhere from 3.4 to 4.6 for a new belt and 2.3
to 3.1 for a used belt. I don't think setting the tension to these values
is a big problem but, they are certainly not within factory specs.
