For about a week the clutch pedal in my '87 924S had been acting =
strange.  If the car hadn't been driven for a couple of hours (ie before =
I went to work, and before I went home) the pedal would stick on the way =
up.  I'd press the pedal to the floor, and on the way up it would stick =
a little at about the halfway point for 1/2 a second, but then find its =
way up.  I'd just pump the pedal three or four times before starting the =
car, and everything was fine.  I was getting ready to take it to my =
garage, but then I had to stop driving for a while for medical resasons, =
so it became a lower priority.  About a week after it was last driven, I =
went to take her for a spin, but as soon as I touched the pedal it swung =
all the way to the floor.  I pryed it up with my toes, and it swung all =
the way back up.  The pedal now acts like a light switch -- either off =
or on, with no in-between.  Of course I havn't tried even turning the =
car on, and I intend to have it taken care of this week, but I'm curious =
as to what might have happened.  I'm prepared for the worst, but I'm =
wondering if anybody has a good guess of what might be wrong based on =
what I've told you.

My other question...
Is there a list out there somewhere of recommended garages?  I've been =
going to a garage here in KW called the AutoWorks, and don't have any =
real complaints, but a friend and fellow P-owner of mine keeps telling =
me I'm insane for not taking it to Furtmair Auto on the other side of =
town...  Of course if there's anybody out there from Kitchener-Waterloo =
with an opinion I'd love to hear it, but I'd also be interested in =
seeing a *big* list of garages recommended by other P-owners.

Thanks,

Reg
