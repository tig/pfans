Had car stored in garage for the winter.  In Nov. pulled it out to let it
run for a bit.  Battery was dead (may need a new one), started car and
while hood was up noticed there was gas leaking from what I believe is
called the" fuel rail" where it connects to what I think is the fuel
injectors.

I had been pumping the gas when trying to start it.  I have a Haynes
manual for the car  but didn't find any help.  Did some research on the
internet  a couple months back and there was a Safety Recall in April
1990 (Recall LO1) -Replacement of Fuel Hose /Rail.  In Jun 86 there was a
safety recall for replacement of Fuel Return Line Hose.  

Has any one experienced a similar problem?  Would appreciate some
feedback before I talk to my mechanic.  I really enjoy driving this car
and am anxious to get it going for this spring and summer.  

This digest has been most helpful.  Keep up the good work
