Well, it seems pretty obvious that the power factor of performance in my
85.5na isn't going to increase much more with any reasonable amount of
cash, so now I'm looking at suspension upgrades.  Currently everything is
stock, so I'm looking for advise on shocks/springs/sway bars/etc..  I
currently ride only street, but the crystal ball does offer glimpses of
more serious track use in the near future.  But even so, street use is the
veery primary concern.

My mechanic has never much been into autocross or other racing scenarios
involving serious handling (he's primarly a dragster), so I'm taking
hisopinions with a grain of salt.  He seems to have something against Koni
shocks (most the ones he's used have developed early leaks and the like, I
guess).  He really likes Bilsteins, and recommended a much cheaper shock
with very similar ride qualities (and I'm blankingon the name right now). 
Comments?  Suggestions?  I like the idea of having easily adjustable
shocks, but as I tihnk I'll be spending a lot of time on the street and
very little on the track, I don't like the idea enoguh to trade off on
shock lifespan.

What's the general opinion on springs?  Are the factory set
decent/good/great?  Is it worth considering upgrading to say H & R
progessive rate springs?  What size?  

Previous experiences with lowering has shown I'm trading a lot more wear
and tear for just a slight improvement in handling.  I've never attempted
corner-balancing previous rides, though, so maybe I can blame the lack of
improvement on that.  Is there much advantage to lowering a 944?  How far?

My mech also suggested sticking with the stock sway bars.  Does this make
good sense based on my driving requirements?

The other thing he thought would be useful was a strut brace.  (Relatively)
inexpensive, simple installation, no skin off my back.  Just wondering if
they improve hard cornering much.

Anything else I should consider?  Any brand names, suppliers, or
experiences are appriciated.
