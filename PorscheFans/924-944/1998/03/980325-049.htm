Roxanne,
I wonder if the reformulated gasoline is the same formula as that
made by Chevron in California.  The effect on older fuel systems as
reported at www.derporsche.net/rgas.htm is horrendous.  Chevron
apparently admits:

"However, In the Chevron tests, the frequency of fuel system
failures for the vehicles fueled with California Phase 2 RFG
(Reformulated Gasoline), was GREATER (my emphasis) than the
frequency for the vehicles fueled with conventional gasoline.
Because the difference was STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (emphasis
added), Chevron believes that its testing demonstrated a potential
for California Phase 2 RFG to affect elastomeric fuel system parts
in older or high mileage vehicles...."
"Owners should monitor their fuel systems (like the average owner
even knows where it IS), repairing any leaks immediately."
Chevron even emphasized this in BOLD TYPE:
"VEHICLES NEVER SHOULD BE OPERATED WITH A FUEL LEAK."

BTW I have been doing lab studies on Techron additive for the past
three months and have, as yet, found no measurable difference on the
effect on fuel lines with and without Techron.  Many P-fans have
reported to me fuel system failures after adding Techron but as far
as I can tell, it might just be coincidence.  Finding technical
papers on this subject is very difficult.

I have seen comments on your question about fuel injectors, but at
present am unable to locate the information.
