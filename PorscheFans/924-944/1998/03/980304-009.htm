Ok I know this is a old thread, but thought it may amuse.

Here in the UK, we all know that the Police force (the boys in blue)
hate drivers of Porsche's. Not happy with stopping my three time in 24
hours (which included a full search of my car by a armed response unit)
They a now intent to remove my car or my from the roads.

Brief history......

Car has been off the road for the best part of a year having a full
engine rebuild , new clutch, Hybrid Turbo, etc etc etc 
 
Got the car back on the road 18/2/98. Drove into work. Stopped by
Traffic Police in their nice shinny new Volvo. Excess Speed!

I don't think so officer, the car has less than 100 miles on a new
engine that I have just paid mega bucks for. Im not about to thrash
it. Maybe you equipment is out, Can I see the calibration log?

Reply. Don't be cheeky, If you don't watch it Ill do you for dangerous
driving as well. And I'm sure I can find a few other items wrong with your
car.

Translation: Take the fine and endorsement or loose your license.

21/2/98 Saturday Night, Take trip into town go to local night club.
Car Immobilise would not work so Opened the bonnet and pulled HT cable
just to be safe. 2:30am going home. Got back to car, opened bonnet and
replaced HT cable and managed to get 20m down the road before being
stopped and detained for breaking into and stealing my own car.
(I had no proof of ID on me)

27/2/98 Driving into work again. Stopped by Traffic Police AGAIN.
Excess Speed AGAIN! NO NOT THIS TIME. Small rant to police offices
Demanding their Names and Numbers (Badge Numbers). (I'm starting a
collection!)

Let of with a caution. Gee Thanks!


Today 4/3/98 Driving into work again. Stopped by Traffic Police AGAIN!
Just a routine check. Something new, but took his Name and Number to add
to my collection. Checked the car, Everything OK. Checked the documentation
, All OK. Then decided to breatherlise my, Said he could smell Booze on my
breath (at 9:00am!!!!! He must have a real low opinion of me). Ha! Fat chance
I don't drink during the week. 

He left looking disappointed.


The future. I'm currently collecting Names and ID off all officers that stop
me. I considering taping any conversations. When I get to 20 or so (7 already)
I'm making a formal complaint of police harassment.

Unless they get me first! :)

To any UK Police Officer on the list. LEAVE ME ALONE! I look after my car
spending a small fortune each year maintaining it. Its always insured.
I follow the speed limit (I get my fun when I take the car to Germany
twice a year!). Pick on the uninsured Rust heaps or the BMW's doing 120+
(well some of them) or the people how think its fun to follow me a 2m distance
doing 70mph.


Things not to say to police offices.

Officer: So do you know why we stopped you?
You: Possession of a fast car and long hair?

Officer: Whats the insurance like on this car.
You: Probably more than you earn in a month.

Officer: Have you been drinking?
You: Well I had a coffee about half an hour ago.


Sorry about the rant, But I had to express this grief some how.

Drive safe people!

Best regards 

Richard.
