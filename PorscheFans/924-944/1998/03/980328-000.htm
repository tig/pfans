Oops! I overlooked this one. (Freudian?) Seriously, if I thought I had
the level of experience needed to head up an advanced DE program I'd be
overjoyed to do it. But since I'm not... So come up with something else
within MNY for me to do. I'd be happy to lend a hand and give back to
the club some of what it has given me. All this talk has me convinced
that negative reinforcement must be balanced by positive reinforcement.
Otherwise it is wasted.

Now I'm going to go get drunk in honor of Ferry Porsche. My condolences
to the family...
