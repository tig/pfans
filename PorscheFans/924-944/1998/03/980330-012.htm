No... 951S = 944S2 M030 = OEM Koni single-adjustable coil-over strut. Koni
makes a replacement double-adjustable coil-over strut for this application
(or they (or Truechoice) can test, rebuild or convert to double adjustable
the OEM Koni's).

Regular 944S2 = regular 968 = OEM Sachs (probably) normal strut (non
coil-over). This strut is specifically valved for the 944S2 and 968 and
varies very slightly from the usual 944 turbo strut. Koni used to make a
replacement double-adjustable non-coil-over strut with sport valving for
this application. Supposedly they don't anymore, according to a few posters
on the list.

So... you and I have no worries :-). The majority of S2 owners are SOL
(maybe) unless they want to experiment with turbo units or get the factory
sport shocks (which may not be available at anything approaching a
reasonable price) or maybe Bilstein has a listing? A while back
perkins@alink.net was looking into trying the turbo units on his S2 - I
dunno how far he got.
