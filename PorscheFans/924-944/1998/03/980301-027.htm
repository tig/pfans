Hi everybody, I'm a brand new subscriber.
I've got an early 77 924 that I bought (really
cheap) as my first porsche project.
When I bought it, it ran on 2 cylinders.  I'm
excited to have  it running now, (after getting a
fuel distributor from a parts car) but the oil
pressure seems low. My chiltons manual says 70 psi
(5 bar) @5000rpm, and my Haynes says 5-7 bar at
@2000 rpm Which is right ?(I tend to trust
Haynes)  Mine is 4 bar @ 2000 rpm.   When I bought
the car it had a proffesionally installed
aftermarket turbo on it (Windblown Systems if
anybody knows anything about them), which I'm
removing, but I wonder, if they went as far as
putting low compression pistons in it, if that
would account for the lower oil pressure (the
sensor is ok).
Mike
