With all this talk about aftermarket wastegates, i figure this is the
first place to ask.  Does anybody have a good used factory wastegate
that will fit on my 88 turbo S that they want to sell?  Mine seems to be
opening on it's own at about 1.5 absolute bar even with no pressure to
it.  I see my car had the original one replaced ( it just flat broke)
with a used unit from Oklahoma Foreign in 96 and it was $150.00.  I am
going to call them tomorrow and see what the going price is, but I would
much rather get one from someone here that actually had it on their car,
working, to 2+ bar.  Anybody that wants to sell their working original
wastegate, e-mail me with your price asap.


Thanks,
