The ABSOLUTE WORST things to say to a police officer:

I can't reach my license unless you hold my beer.

Sorry, Officer, I didn't realize my radar detector wasn't plugged in.

Bad cop! No donut!

Aren't you the guy from the Village People?

Hey, you must've been doin' about 125 mph to keep up with me! Good job!

Excuse me. Is "stick up" hyphenated?

But I thought you had to be in relatively good physical condition to be a
police officer...


You're not gonna check the trunk, are you?

Didn't I see you get your butt kicked on Cops ?

So, uh, you on the take, or what?

Gee, Officer! That's terrific. The last officer only gave me a warning,
too!

What do you mean, "Have I been drinking?" You're the trained specialist.

Well, when I reached down to pick up my bag of crack, my gun fell off my
lap and got lodged between the brake pedal and the gas pedal, forcing me
to speed out of control.

No Mr. Budweiser, I've only had two officers...
