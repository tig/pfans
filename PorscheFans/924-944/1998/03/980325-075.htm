A few digests back a couple of fellow listers expressed interest in acquiring
a "shot" 944. I mentioned that I knew of one in Louisville, KY.

I believe the car is an 84 -it has wider wheels in back than in front which I
think are OE. It is black, had the engine replaced with a 60K used one and a
new clutch as well.

The bad part is that it has been sitting outdoors for nearly 3 years, but I
believe it runs.

Anyway, the owner abandoned it at a local shop and they kept it as payment.
The title change is in process and it looks like an OK buy for someone
interested in quite a bit of cosmetic and interior work to save a few Ks

The shop owner's name is Esmail Tagizadeh (first name pronounced ISHMAIL,
surname no can do). He is a nice person and you can probably bring him down
some, but don't quote me on this.

Good luck to those interested. BTW: it's black/black
