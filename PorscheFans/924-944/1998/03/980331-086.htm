Some words of wisdom on who to go to ( in the Puget Sound Region, Wash
State) and who to ( very definitely ) stay away from!
	The rear defogger, wiper, remote hatch release on my '92968 had stopped
working, as well as the Auto HVAC system went to full heat, shut itself
off, then you froze.   
	My first trip was ( out of ignorance ) to Barrier Porsche and they
proceeded to spend  1 1/2 hrs, then told me they weren't working, then,
said pay your bill and leave.  Didn't fix anything, nor tell what the
problem was.
	Very definitely STAY AWAY from Speedware Motorsports in Redmond, Wash. 
Their staff is either incompetent or dishonest, and either one is very
dangerous and probably the most despised opration in the NW.
	I did take my 968 to Continental Motors, in Lake City, and, their guy
found all the problems, and, the charge was reasonable.  
	Now if I can just get someone to put a Limited slip diff on my
car.....for not much $.
