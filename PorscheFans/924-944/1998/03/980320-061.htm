> looking for anyone with experience using the
big valve head on a 2.8L  951. I've been told by one aftermarket
performance shop that I will lose low end torque with the big valve head.=

Today, I was told by another shop that I would gain low end torque. Does
anyone have any practical experience with this application?<

No practical experience but this is what my engine builder said:  If
nothing else on the engine is changed then the big valve head will not hu=
rt
low end torque.  The intake runners are what affect the low end not the
size of the valves.

His example was the small block Chevy.  The large valve heads are in high=

demand and hard to come by.  The small valve heads can be bought for next=

to nothing.  The hot rodder tooling around on the street wouldn't run the=

big valves if they didn't give him power off the line.

BTW, your large valve head is only good for a door stop, send it to me an=
d
I will use it on my engine.  If you haven't had the exhaust ports of you
head ceramic coated then I would suggest you look into it.  The ceramic
coating on the turbo head keeps the exhaust heat from transfering to the
head.

Small valve head but dreaming of BIG valves  =
