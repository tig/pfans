Do any of you have or have any of you placedlthe two drain tubes in the
trunk area to improve drainage to the trunk. Have any of you have trouble
with the filler pipe leaking and causing a smell of fuel in the car when it
is filled up? Have any of you had to replace trunk carpet? I just receieved
two manuals WKD 497 321 and WKD 495 721 on the cab and would think that they
would be insdispensablge to a cab owner.

I'm going to replace shocks in the car. Tweeks has a deal on the fronts
(Sachs OEM) for $107 each and Vertex has the rears (also Sachs) for $59
each. Konis would be about $300 more and since I will not use this car at
events I thought I would save this amount. Any opinions on this would be
appreciated.

Anybody have opinions about running four same size tires on the car?
