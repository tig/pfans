Hey there! I read somewhere in a magazine that there is now a Porsche
mountain bike. Look out......I'm gonna trade in my '94 Cannondale F500
for one of these bad boys! Anyone else heard about this?

By the way, I was out for all of last week. The Coast Guard sent me up
to Alexandria Virginia for training on upgrading our system fm Windows
NT 3.51 to NT 4.0 and scratch load directly to NT 4.0 w/ svcpk3,
including uniform configs for the USCG. So, with this in mind, I've got
a lot of email to catch up on as well as a lot of backlog on my
worklist.

Since I'm here, I might as well throw out an inquiry for the list. Upon
my return to Miami, I was very anxious to get back into my 944. Well, I
noticed that the engine began to idle and throttle up roughly. After a
quick diagnostics of my engine system, I noticed that the phillips head
setting screw for the air flow meter came loose. Vibration, my guess. I
readjusted the wiper arm back to what I thought was the original
position. Yet, I believe that the wiper is not registering the same
angle position back to the DME. Thereby reducing my engines power and
torque. I can feel the reduction. What I'd like to find out is what is
the correct matching angle setting for the wiper arm to the plastic
retainer so that it will be the same angle as the air flow damper. Need
some help here, please.
