<<<<You're not raining on my parade... more likely Pacific NW Region
PCA.
After going through this DE I have to agree it left a lot to be desired.
The whole day should have been dedicated to the 1st time drivers, not
intermixed with all the other run groups.  That would allowed plenty of
time for one-on-one instruction.  However, I'm sure that would have also
raised the price considerably.  In my particular case I felt safe enough
due to my years of driving experience, however I know that others
probably
didn't feel too good about the situation.  Just following along behind
another car could easily have been intimidating for some people.>>>>

Dedicating an entire day to first-time drivers is really not necessary.
Keeping the number of drivers in the first two groups who need
instructors within the range of the number available is the clue. Here's
how MNY runs things:

Green - Novices and people with very limited track experience.
Blue - People with some track experience but most still not permanently
signed off.
White - Intermediates - all signed off. Danger group! Beware!
Black - Advanced with some instructors.
Red - Instructors only.

Each session is typically 20 minutes long and each group gets 4 sessions
per day (except instructors who get 5 sessions). On weekdays, some of
the groups are concatenated to ensure that all the flag stations can be
manned. On weekends, ther are typically 25 or so people in each group so
this is not a problem.

Typically, nobody in Green/Blue gets temporarily signed off the first
day of the weekend. By temporarily, I mean that they allow you to "Solo"
on the second or third day of the weekend once you have shown your head
is in the 'right place'. This should not be confused with being
permanenetly signed off. Once this happens you do not have to have an
instructor in your car again - ever. But I think you are being really
stupid if you don't avail yourself to the free instruction, even in
Black or in Red. Yes, even if you are an instructor. The ability level
between various instructors is huge. I am gradually working my way
through _all_ of the instructors in MNY and NNJR - anybody who will let
me ride with them and anybody who will ride with me.

Also note that I highlighted the White Group. To me, this is the place
where most mishaps occur. You finally got permanently signed off and you
are starting to explore the limits of the car by yourself. There are
some real hotshots in faster cars that are going a lot faster than you.
You try to keep up. You roll your car into a ball. Most never come back.

<<<I may look into Portland and see what they have down there at PIR.>>>

Well, now you know some of the questions to ask. You can even work
within your existing organization's structure by only going out when an
instructor is available. But you are then faced with the problem that a
lot of others who should have an instructor in the car don't, and they
are on the track at the same time. At least you will have two sets of
eyes to watch out for dangerous situations. Remember, the most important
aspect of DE is safety!

<<<I guess this discussion should have moved to the Racing list, but I
still
feel it has relevancy here.>>>

Either place or even both is fine. I hope these discussions may persuade
others to try DE. It is really one of the best parts of owning a Porsche
and being part of the PCA. I know my speeding tickets have certainly
declined since I got involved!

I should also warn you that some regions hold time trials instead of DE.
I would avoid these like the plague. Once you start timing yourself and
getting silly trophies for beating someone else the level of risk goes
up dramatically.

Keep the shiny side up!

Paul Foster
