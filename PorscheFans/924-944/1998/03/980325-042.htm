<< I have broken off a stud in the head trying to force them on.  It is now
out, 
 but I am not going through that again.  The funny thing about the flanges is 
 that there is only one locating bolt hole.  The other holes are twice the 
 diam. and the third is a slot.  I am thinking of opening up the locator hole 
 to allow the pipes to bolt up.  Port matching become a concern if I do this, 
 but the alternative is to buy new($$$$) or used($$) manifolds. >>

Jay,
I ground one of the holes slightly larger until I could get the bolt through
(I decided to use bolts instead of studs).  Additionally, one of the flanges
was about a millimeter further away form the surface of the head (i.e., if you
set the 2 flange end of the header on a flat surface, one of the flanges would
be about a millimeter from the surface).  I basically just used two gaskets on
this flange.  I figure if it's gonna leak, it'll do it this sunday at Driver's
ed.

Regarding the port matching.  The exhaust port itself is smaller in diameter
than the header flange opening.  I'm not sure how much out of position it
would take to effect the flow much, but I'ld guess you have a little room to
play with.

Good luck.

PS:  Does your 1/4 manifold have the bellows on it?
