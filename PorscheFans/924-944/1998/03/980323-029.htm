Howdy,

Just back at work again after a crazy weekend where Paul and I spent nearly
two hours behind the wheel of our karts.  The conditions were horrible, wet
and lots of standing water.  Our coach (who I think must be related somehow
to Jim's engine builder) sent us out again on slicks with a full dry setup.

This was the first time for us at this track, it's pretty fast and looked 
quite dangerous, the standing water did not help my confidence.

I've always had four fears about racing:
- losing your brakes
- having a stuck throttle
- losing steering control
- having a differential lock up

One of the reasons why I sold my Talon was that I was afraid the transfer
case would lock up one day and lock all four tires and shoot me off track.
It's a fairly common occurance on AWD Talons, the NHTSA is currently
investigating a number of failures.

Well, in two weekends of running the karts and about three hours behind
the wheel on the track, I've now experienced all my fears, and it's not
so bad afterall :)

On my first session on Saturday, I went happily down the straight, foot
to the floor (more like front bumper), hydroplaning my way to an early
braking point.  Unfortunately, the brakes didn't stop the kart!  I had
no brakes.  I did five more laps using friction braking, which means,
let off early, huck kart into corner, use oversteer to turn kart in.
On the sixth lap, I decided enough is enough and pulled in.  The safety
brake cable (the backup one) had somehow binded up and didn't allow the
normal brake bar to do its job!

Last weekend, I had the stuck throttle which wasn't too bad, just had
to use the brake to control the wheelspin (I kind of felt like Hakkinen)
and managed to finish that session, at least I didn't have to worry about
what my right foot was doing anymore.  Last weekend, I also went for the
wild ride when my chain jammed and sent me into a few wild spins as
the rear tires locked up at the fastest section of the track.  When I spun
last week, the steering wheel snapped to the full lock position and bent
the tie-rod.  We bent it back since it was a mild bend and ordered a new
part.

Well, this weekend, on my last session of the day, after the long fast
straight, I went to turn in and the kart went straight, then it turned
around faster than I could think, "what the hell?"  I kept the motor
running and tried to go, but quickly noticed one wheel pointing in a 
funny direction.  Yup, you guessed it, my tie-rod broke!

I also had an off road excursion through the tires.  You have no idea how
much water a pile of tires can hold.  It was like getting hit by a waterfall
when I went into the tires.

By the end of the day, we were starting to get used to driving on the slicks
and were able to keep up with the rain tire guys in the corners.  Down the
straight, they would kill me, but in the corners, as long as I hit my apex,
we were about the same.

My favourite parts to the weekend:
1. Coming into a hairpin, this guy with a full rain setup dives in the inside
   of me to pass me.  He gets ahead, but is carrying too much speed to turn
   in and spins it.  I re-pass him on the exit as he sits there trying to 
   re-gain control.
2. Coming off the fast straight, I jump on the brakes to turn in, two karts
   with a rain setup pass me, one on the inside, one on the outside, both
   go a bit wide and I re-pass them on slicks on the inside.  I then gave
   them racing room in the next hairpin so as not to hold them up.
3. I'm a little quicker than Paul (lighter weight and all) coming up to a set
   of corners.  I decide I'm going to go for it and try a pass on the inside.
   As we approach the corner, Paul loops it under braking and sends his kart
   backwards into the tires and over the rubber berms.  I end up taking a 
   crazy line to get around the mess, but somehow Paul pops out in front of
   me almost taking me out.  We fight like crazy for another few laps until
   I spin :)
4. Paul and I ran an entire session nose to tail, him behind :)  We had a few
   people pass us and we passed a few people, but we stayed together through
   the whole session.  It's hard to describe the intensity of hearing a kart
   motor turning 10,000rpm creeping around you.

Hope you enjoyed the above.  Next week is my second club race.  I can't wait
'till I get really good at this kart racing stuff, there's so much to learn.
Thank God I have a coach, he's taken 2-3 years off my learning curve.
