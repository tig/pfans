An accusump is in essence a giant syringe of oil. When one's oil line
pressure drops beyond a certain point, the accusump starts pushing oil into
the system to compensate. It also can act as a pre-oiler, lubricating the
motor before startup. One final benefit is that the accusump will act as a
"capacitor" or "absorber," evening out oil pressure.

The reason one can use an accusump in a *racing* 944 application has to do
with what is now generally accepted as an aeration problem with the oil
pump intake. What I mean is that at high rpm, the oil pump intake is being
uncovered and thus some air is being sucked in along with the oil (1). This
air being sucked causes "foaming," foaming oil is not exactly the greatest
bearing lubricant, and the weak point in the oil system fails, in our case
#2 rod bearing(2).

So, you say, where did all the oil go? After all, when you look at the oil
pan on a bench, its a pretty impressive large piece. Well, the faster and
longer you run an engine, the more oil ends up in the motor, the less in
the pan. As an example, at 2000 rpm, a drag-racing small block Chev has 4.5
quarts of oil in the reservoir (Yeah, its a drysump system, but the idea's
the same.) At 9000 rpm, that same motor has only 1/2 quart in the reservoir
- the rest of the oil is still being moved around the engine!

So, the easy solution is: put in more oil. Some people say a 1/2 l, some
people say 1l. The problem with this - WHEN YOU'RE RACING - is that too
much oil sitting in the pan costs horsepower.  I read somewhere that
knife-edging a 944 crank was worth 14hp at race rpm's. Easy to believe when
deep-sumping a 350 chev drag motor is worth 30 hp(3). For street, lapping,
and autocross, some extra oil is cheap insurance. Note the #2 bearing
problem first cropped up when race teams starting running motors with oil
filled to the <min> mark on the dipstick. Good for power, bad because ya
won't finish. There's a rumour floating around that when the factory
changed dipstick designs in '88 one of the things they did was raise the
levels 1/2 l. 

A slightly harder solution is to try and put what oil there is in the right
place, where the pickup is. Hard cornering sloshes the oil around in the
pan, potentially uncovering the pickup. The factory did this when it
changed pan designs, and Mr. Milledge (among others) have come up with
additional baffles, scrapers, windage trays, etc., in the pan to keep the
oil near the pickup.

Another solution is, once the oil is circulating in the motor, is to get it
back down into the pan faster. This is a common modification with motors
designed with hydraulic lifters run continuously at high rpm. For example,
17 minutes (I clocked it the second time, I couldn't believe it the first)
into a 20 minute testing session, my Suzuki Swift (1.3l DOHC) completely
fills the top of the head to the point that oil is being forced back into
the intake (thru the PCV)! When this happens, what comes out the exhaust
pipe looks *very* *scary*. Some people have done mods to the 944 motor by
boring out/drilling additional oil return passages in the head and/or
restricting oil passages up to the head. This can be tricky. 

A different approach is to change the way oil is circulated in the motor so
that more oil goes to the bottom end (where it is needed) and less to the
top (where it isn't) at race rpm's. This is what Milledge (and others) do
when they cross-drill the crankshaft, effectively doubling the supply of
oil to the bearing. There is some concern as this weakens and reduces the
stiffness of the crank, but in a 944 I don't think that is a problem if
done and finished correctly.

Finally, we can accusump and/or combine solutions. One other side issue is
the use of an external oil cooler. Trymorris@fiest.com (KISS engineering)
has some impressive test results about how much oil temps are reduced with
a small mocal cooler (installed as part of a kit he sells), even in a 951.
Something else to keep in mind. After destroying multiple motors in my 924S
(2), I plan on using an accusump and an additional cooler in my "new" S2.

1. Yes, some people believe the 944 oil pump itself "cavitates" under high
rpm. If so, raising the static oil level wouldn't help. It does.

2. The rod bearing generally gives some notice of failure. First, power
will be lost, some "omph" will be missing. Second, oil pressure will
gradually decrease, with a larger jump when the bearing "spins." Third,
umpleasant noises and big smoke. One gets about a half-lap under the first
sign. If caught in time, you only have to replace the bearings. Lucky you.
At two, as soon as the bearing spins, maybe a lap later, you're looking at
engine removal, rod replacement, and crank
inspection/refinishing/replacement. Still lucky. At three, buy new motor. 

3. Obviously, there isn't any room in a 944 to make the oil pan deeper.

>don't mean hp) also, has anyone looked into converting the lights to be blue
>like all the newer cars?

Litronic conversions are big bucks because the bulbs are not 12v, but
higher voltage so a power supply is neccary. One can get the effect by
painting  regular headlight bulbs blue or something like that. Evidently
such items are available in motorcycle stores. Cheap fashion, imho.

<yawn> This post is way too long.
