Well, I did take out my dme, and it does appear that some of the printed
circuit board material has been burned open like a fuse. It even appears that
it may be a little further downstream on the same leg I bridged with solder
earlier this year, to repair a small spot I thought was corroded open. This is
in a spot that was undamaged and fairly wide, so I suspec there is trouble
still not found. George, you seem to be up to speed on the battery overvoltage
phenomenon. Is it necessary to pull the alternator for a proper test at an out
parts place, to get the battery out of the loop. I did replace this batter in
January or so, as the one that I got the car with was toast, but it was 4
years old too. I don't think it was boiled out though. I have noticed a squeel
from a belt when I start the car in the morning, which goes away after a few
seconds. I have taken it to be a slightly loose alt. belt, which I changed not
long ago, responding to the extra load put on the alternator to replace the
battery voltage used up on starting. Maybe the regulator is causing problems.
Would the battery be enough to conceal significant overvoltage from the volt
meter? I cannot yet tell if there is chip damage in the dme, and I suspect
that simply replacing the dme will not solve the problem. I tend to think
electronics don't usually fail from old age, but because something else around
them is outside parameters. Any help appreciated. Oh, and uh, Goerge, in the
event this unit is total toast, whats the cost and availability of a used DME,
for 87 924S? -Frenna@aol.com
