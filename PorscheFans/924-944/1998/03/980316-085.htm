Hey P-fans,
   This is my first time attempting to send something to the list so I hope it
works and I don't screw it up.  Anyways, I own a 1983 944, black.  Today while
coming home from work and nice woman in an Altima decided to rear end me and
basically destroy my bumper, and in the process put pressure on the body
directly above the left rear tire.  The body panel know has giant cracks in
the body, the cracks start from the alarm hole and continue to the edge of the
end of the wheel housing.  Can these panels be fixed without having to buy a
whole new panel?  Or am I looking at a whole new panel?  Basically my question
is if anybody knows a good auto repair shop in Denver, Colorado, or even in
Boulder.  And the other is does anyone know how much the bumper and such will
probably end up costing??????  I just need a rough figure, I am thinking I
need a new bumper with pads, it needs to be painted, also the repair of the
body will end up costing some serious money.  If anybody has any ideas please
email me or something.  EXKMARTMAN@aol.com.  
Thanks guys I appreciate it,
Patrick
'83 944  (Black, and rear ended)
