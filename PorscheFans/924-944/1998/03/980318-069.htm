$1700 to replace.  Yowch!

I have a few questions you fine list members might be able to help with.

1. I've heard the 968 fuel tank is the same as the 944 tank  (i.e.
interchangeable, same part number).  Anybody know for sure?

2. Could I replace the fuel tank myself?  Anybody done this themselves and
have some tips to share?>>

I don't know if the tanks are interchangeable, but I removed the plastic tank
on my 1985.5 944 myself.  It is a royal pain, but for $1700, I'd do it again.
You have to remove the transaxle and the crossmember, plus go inside the car
and remove the protective metal cover that goes over the fuel inlet pipe to
disconnect the fuel filler pipe and various secondary vent tubes.  On my car,
the cover was glued to the floor with some really gooey black mastic stuff,
and was difficult to remove.  Eveything else (removing fuel lines, etc.) was
reasonably self explanatory.  You will want to have as little fuel in the tank
as possible before you remove it (it's heavy, and the tank holds a LOT), and
of course will want to be very careful working around fuel vapors to avoid any
ignition sources.  Good luck.
