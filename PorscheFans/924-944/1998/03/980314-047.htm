Here is a good one.  I need the other 88 944 turbo S owners out there to
help me out.

I posted the other day about the cert of auth for the cars.  Well while
I was on the phone with PCNA I thought I would ask them what info they
had about my car (88 951 S).  I gave the guy my VIN and he proceeded to
read off to me what I owned.  He said I had a 1988 944 turbo in , get
this, zenith blue!  I said WHAT!  I asked him to read me the options,
and as he read them off he got down to the 758 and said "S".  I said, so
it's a turbo S? and he replied yes.  I then asked why my vin# after the
JN started with 1 instead of 5.  And why my engine code was 51 on the
option sticker instead of 52 (We checked, it is the original engine 52
in the car, including turbo & brain boxes).  I also asked why the
factory touch up paint I found in the rear side pocket said silberrosa
met with code M3Z which was what is on the option sticker (the car is
CLEARLY silver rose).  Well PCNA was at a loss to really explain this. 
His only thought was that mine was one of the first cars made as the "S"
and it may have just started out as a zenith blue 944 turbo, then had
the S option installed, leaving without having the data updated, or is
was one of the first cars before they started changing all the vin
digits to 5.  He did promise to get all the build info from atlanta, and
Germany to answer my questions.  I have to say PCNA had the "anything
for a customer" attitude.

The original Selling dealer papers list the color as silver rose, and
the previous owners (2) confirm no repaints.  I have had a complete shop
inspection, the car is 100% original, USA car, built 12/97.

I want to know what the other 88 951 "S" cars say.  Has anybody else had
these issues with the factory paperwork?  I am sure it is what it is
just by the 758 code and the selling dealers paperwork.  I would like to
hear from all the 88 951 S owners out there.  Please e-mail me directly
the following info:

your build date, the first vin digit after the JN (5 or 1), motor code
(51 or 52 off the option sticker in the rear, we know it really has the
52), and the color code (i.e. LM3Z again off the option code sticker). 
I am only interested in the 88 models.

Thank in advance,
