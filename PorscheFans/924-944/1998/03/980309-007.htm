All,

After finally realizing that there aren't really any new cars made =
that a) I would like to own and
b) I can afford I started thinking used. Some searching turned up =
the 968 a good possibility at least
from the stand point of price. Also, to me a Porsche has more soul =
than some of the alternatives I've=20
considered in the 20-30K range.=20

 However, very little showed up in terms of the car itself-  =
performance, common problems, total cost of ownership etc.=20
Oh yeah, coupe vs. cabriolet? Also should I stay away from the =
earlier 968s ('92)- the whole it takes Porsche=20
a while to get a car right argument? Might I expect that the =
difference between the cost of a used 968 and
a new 986 will evaporate because of the cost of maintaining the =
used vehicle? I certainly can't afford that type
of expense right now. =20

I've read the 944 faq which is great but I don't have a great idea =
of how much of what is said about the
944 applies to the 968. I've gone through a lot of the archives of =
this list but so far I'm only back to about
mid '97. And, of course, I joined this mailing list. :-)=20

Any comments to a perspective 968 owner will be greatly =
appreciated. TIA

Regards- Jeremy
