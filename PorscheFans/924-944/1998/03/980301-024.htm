>Brakes:  I've been trying to research an upgrade & was wondering what was
available for my '86 NA 944.  I believe these to be the most logical or
prevalent:     1)  '86 944 Turbo     2)  '87+ 944 Turbo    3)  944S or
late-model 944 Turbo     4)  ?????

The 944S has (I think) the same brakes as yours. The S2 has turbo brakes.

>Let me know if I'm way off base with this stuff.  I probably won't be
considering an exotic (i.e. >$3000) upgrade since I paid only $3000 for the
car this past November.  I know that I need new wheels too.  I'd really
appreciate any response & I know many of you have got this information
memorized.  The recent information re. the 968 rotors has been helpful as
well.

What exactly is wrong with the stock system? I can understand if your car
has been boosted or chipped that better brakes might be an issue, but on a
NA? Are you really fading now? This is what I did to my 924 (same brakes)
w/success:

1. Change the fluid. *All* the fluid. Clean and clear everywhere. Ford
Hi-performance is excellent, widely available fluid.
2. Lubricate those calipers. I find this really affects the pedal feel on
floating-caliper designs.
2. Change rotors to new, factory "Porsche" on-the-box rotors. Clean the
rotor before installation and bed them in properly afterwards. Rotors that
have been turned or rusty do not dissipate heat as well as new ones.
3. Put in carbon pads, in a compound suitable for your driving. Many brands
available. Don't use race pads unless you need them. A good economy
substitute are "MetalMasters." Make sure to bed the pads in.
4. Remove the backing plates. This will ease cooling of the rotors somewhat
at the track. Probably not needed to be done in the back, and the back
plates keep more dirt off in any case. (You must now clean and lubricate
the front brakes more often now that the backing plate is gone.)
5. Inspect and replace any suspect brake line/hose. I don't honestly know
if stainless steel really makes any difference in this application.
6. If there is anything weird, get the rest of the system checked (Master
cylinder, valves, ABS, etc.).
