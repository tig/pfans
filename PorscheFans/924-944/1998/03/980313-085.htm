Here in SoCal, land of countless unemployed aerospace engineers, we use t=
he
F-18 wing repair method.  Epoxy resin by its self does not have much flex=

strength.  It need some sort of material to bond to that has high flex
strength like glass cloth. =


Sand around the back side of the broken area and wipe down with acetone. =

Cut two pieces of fiberglass cloth (#7500 or boat cloth is fine), carbon
fiber or Kevlar.  Mix up some 30 minite epoxy (slower setting makes a
stronger bond).  Paint the sanded area with the epoxy, lay down the piece=

of cloth and wet it out with epoxy.  Lay down the next piece on a bias
(doesn't really matter) and wet out.  =

Premask any areas you do not want resin on.  Use teflon, polyester, vinyl=

or any substantial tape other than paper masking tape.  Prefit a piece of=

aluminum, wood or plastic plate over the crack area.  Cover this piece wi=
th
a piece of polyetheylene sheeting or baggie. =


Place the baggie on the fiberglass then place the plate over it and clamp=

it with C clamps.  This will squeeze out the excess resin and air bubbles=

and make a good bond to the spoiler.  After it cures overnight, remove th=
e
clamps, the plate, the poly sheet and masking and you should have a spoil=
er
ready hit another curb.  =

Bond Man, vacuum bag it in the autoclave at 350 degrees if you are really=
