««Today when I drive this car out for some distance,
during the drive the fan runs smoothly, when I
stopped the engine, the fan is not running, when I
turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position the fan
runs. When I start the engine, the starter don't even
crank a sound. It cannot start totally. With the key in
the "ON" position, I let the fan run for a while to cool
the engine. After about 5 minute, I can start the engine
again. Can anyone out there help me to rectify this
problem. If this is the timer's problem, then where is the
timer located.»»

Hi Kwan,
1- First of all, when you stop the engine, the fan may continue
working, depending on water temperature, but slower. Maybe you have not
noticed it.
2- I have the same starting problem, which was partially solved putting
a relay in serial with the solenoid of the starter. This is not a true
fix, but it helps, and the idea of the mechanic was driving more
current to the solenoid. 
3- My opinion is replace the wires, and, very important, the ground
strap. This can be the permanent fix, but I've not done this yet,
because the car is running fine now. The heat transfer over the time
can decrease the current drive capability. If you want more details on
how the relay works, e-mail me.
4- I don't know anything about a timer. Someone knows about this?
5- I post this to the list because I've seen this problem before, and
if this is not the reason I also would like to know.
