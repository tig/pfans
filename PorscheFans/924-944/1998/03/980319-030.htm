     I got this humming after i changed may brake pads and rotors (facory) 
     recently.  My theory is that it is the non-asbestos pads which appear 
     to have a higher frictional coefficient and different type of binder 
     material.  My hum was so harsh  that i could feel it in the steering 
     wheel and it was lound!  I fixed it by doing several 100MPH to 30MPH 
     stops until they got hot.  It seemed to have burned off some of the 
     binder material and it smelled like brand new cars do when you drive 
     off the lot and the undercoating protectant on the exhaust burns off.  
     It did not smell like traditional brakes getting hot.  Anyway it fixed 
     my problem.  Porsche requires that non-asbestos pads must be installed 
     in front and rears at the same time.  The non-asbestos pads were 
     Jurids, my old asbestos pads were Textar.

     A few days ago, a fellow 968 owner asked about brake noise.  I have 
     the
     same question and did not see a response.
     
     Just before coming to a stop, the brakes make a low, rumbling type of
     vibration.  No screeching or high pitched sounds.
     
     Is this normal?
     
     Hmmm, now that's interesting.
     I get the same? noise at the same time when stopping from high speed.
     It sounds just like the brakes of a UK Inter-City train.
     I don't recall hearing the noise before I changed the disks(rotors)
     and brake pads. By the way I have no idea at all what it is!
