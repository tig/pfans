>>A simple question.. how is the porsche badge on the front of the 944 
>>held on?  Mine has started to become loose.   Thanks to all.

>>Mike 86 944T Red/Kashmere

I have an 89 944T which had a damaged front emblem.  After spending hours 
trying to get to the backside of the emblem to remove attaching nuts, I 
figured out that it just pushes in from the outside.  Mine got bent in 
the removal process (it was junk anyway), so if your emblem is in good 
shape you might want to be more careful than I was when removing it.  In 
any case, there are plastic sleeves pressed into the header panel that 
grip 2 metal prongs on the badge.  If yours is loose, I would guess that 
the plastic inserts are worn, and I would buy 2 new ones before removing 
the badge (you might want to get a new badge while you're at it; I bought 
one from Don Rosen that was about $25 including the rubber gasket.
