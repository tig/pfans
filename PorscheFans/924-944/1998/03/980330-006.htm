>I have a 1988 944 turbo s.  The heater stays on full blast regardless of
temparature setting.  Have heard this is a common problem with the late
model 944's.  Is there and easy fix or do I have to subject myself to
the dealer.  Any suggestions.<

    On the drivers side of the heater box there is a servo connected to an
air control door via a pull rod. On my 87 the plastic clip that connects the
pull rod to the servo arm had broken. $2 dollars and 5 minutes was all it
took and everything worked fine (reordered twice wrong clip came the first 2
times, if you find this to be the problem i could get the part #) . I
noticed the water control valve was not closing either. It worked fine after
the pull rod was hooked up. Climate control box must have been confused as
the servo arm was flailing around as well. I spent about 3 hrs trying to see
why the water valve wouldn't close before i saw the broken clip.
