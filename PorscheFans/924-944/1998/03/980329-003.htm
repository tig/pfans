Ralph,

I think you're wrong on this one -- according to my reference " Porsche --
Power, Performance and Perfection" by Susann Miller, Ferry's father
Ferdinand celebrated his 75th birthday in September of 1950 and suffered a
stroke and passed away early in 1951. It was Ferdinand's life-long desire to
make a car bearing his name and at the time of his 75th birthday there had
been 300 cars made. It was the son, Ferry, who made his father's vision a
reality and lead the company initially to become what it is today.

True, the legacy does live on, but unless there's another son named Ferry,
it is "The Great One" who's loss we all mourn. This year's many 50th
Anniversay celebrations become more meaningful as we also salute his
passing.
