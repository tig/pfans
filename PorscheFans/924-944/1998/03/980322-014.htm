PFans!!

There it sits in the garage: a 1990 S2 cab, black with linen interior. I
just drove it home 2.5 hours from Hollywood, Florida and it runs great. The
asking price was $14500 and the car has 69,500 miles on it. It is not mint.
It has been repainted, badly (not by the PO who had it for 40,000 miles from
1994 to present) but according to my mechanic and body guy does not appear
to have been damaged in any way so it needs paint. It needs a new top (rear
window is virtually opaque). It also needs a ton of maintenance: although
the owner showed me records and said the belts had been done 15000 miles ago
it appears that only the timing belt was done, so belts and rollers and
check the WP, check the front seals, needs the dreaded chain tensioner,
leaking power steering fluid, needs brake pads, rotors are good, needs
carpet in the trunk where there was a leak, new ac switch and clock. I
estimate and I try to estimate high that I will spend between 5-5500 on the
car but at 15500 I should have a beautiful cab. The other driver in the
family has given her vote of approval and that is a big plus.

This was a good week:sold 1987 911 targa and 1990 S2 coupe and am now down
to the 951S for track and the cab for every day which is what I wanted.

Question: in the right rear wheel well there is a metal pipe wrapped in
rubber that comes from the front of the car towards the back and stops
before it reaches the back end of the car. I have never seen this in any
coupe. Can any of you cab owners tell me what this is? Also the car has a
hypersensitive CODE ALARM which is starting to drive me crazy. Soes anybody
have one of these that they might give me some advice about?
