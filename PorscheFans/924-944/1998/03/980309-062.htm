P-Fans:

I was hoping there might be some advice relative to suspension
upgrade/options?  I'm currently active with SOLO 1 & SOLO 11
events as well as driver's ed. with my PCA.  Overall objective
is to receive my liscence to club race by end of summer.

In this quest I have gotten several different opions.  I have a
'89 951 producing 375+ HP. w/ 6 point roll cage.  Recommendations
include changing torsion bars (I'm not sure my car even has these)
to changing shocks to changing springs to changing stabilizer 
bars...perhaps you have felt this frustration.

Understanding there is no hard/fast rule that everyone might agree
on:
	1. is there any logic in stiffening my suspension via 
		factory available adjustments?  If so, how
		effective w/ this be?

	2. it would seem that increasing rear stabilizer from 17mm
		to 22mm would improve handleing some?

Anyway...any/all input would be great as I need to stiffen the ride

Thank you

Ralph Schroeder
