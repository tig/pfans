I'm still having a problem with the oil pressure
on my 77 924 project car.  I discovered that the
oil was fuel fouled from the defective fuel
distributor.  After clearing up that problem, I
thought that an oil change would solve the oil
pressure drop, but it still drops to about 1bar at
idle speed and the oil light comes on, after the
engine has run for 10-15 minutes.  The sensor is
ok, and I think if it was the oil pump the
pressure would always be bad. The plugs are
burning clean (no oil fouling) and the previous
owner claims the engine was rebuilt, including the
main bearings, however I suspect that things
were'nt measured properly and the main bearings
are the problem. Any thoughts on the subject would
be appreciated before I start the unpleasant task
of removing the engine.

Mike
