of
you know that this car died at Laguna about a year after I bought it (id
est,
1995).  I was going about 50 mph, and hit one of those concrete barrier
deals.
Moved it 2-3 inches.

I was wearing TRW/Sabelt camlock belts.  These stayed on my shoulders
because
they were fed through the back of my Recaro SRB seats.  The harness bar's=

ears
were bent slightly.

I have a new Weltmeister harness bar on my 87 951 and a older model one o=
n
the S2.  The newer one has a larger diameter tube and would seem to be mo=
re
rigid.  Probably an upgrade from experiences like yours.
