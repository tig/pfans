Just completed installing a lower mileage '86 na engine into my '87 na.
Generally went well, except a few questions.
1.  Idle was erratic and ran poor until I disconnected the oxygen sensor.
Runs ok now, but idle is about 1400.  Specs under hood say should be 850.
How can I adjust it?
2.  I used the '87 harness since it was still in the car, rather than the
'86 harness.  Two electrical connectors "extra".  One, at the end of the
harness I know goes to the additional oil pressure sensor on the pan.  No
problem other than the idiot light on the dash stays on.  Pressure gage
reads fine.  The other connector comes out of the harness after the Bosch
idle controller, but before the other sensor connectors.  From my pictures
it appears to bend back under the intake manifold and go to the back of the
engine, but I can not see to what.  Also can not find anything off the old
engine it would go to.  It is a 2-wire connector.  Any ideas?
3.  Brake warning light in middle of cluster now stays on.  Fluid is fine,
brakes work great.  What can I look for?
4.  Used the clutch assembly that came attached to the engine.  From what I
was told, it was newer than what was on the '87.  Very noisy when the pedal
is pressed, but works fine.  Clutch bearing?  Must it be replaced soon, or
should it last?
Thanks.
Ed H.
