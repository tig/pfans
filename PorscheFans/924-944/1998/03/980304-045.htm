pfolks,
My car died on me today on my way to work. Cruising at 70mph without warn=
ing I suddenly lost power. The motor continued to run until my speed drop=
ped to about 50 but I had no power in the accelerator. Then the engine =
died completely and I coasted to a stop.

I tried cranking while still moving but it wouldn't fire. The battery had=
 plenty of juice. The starter was cranking strong. After sitting for 5-10=
 minutes I tried cranking it again and it finally fired. I drove the rema=
ining 15 miles without incident. This occured for a moment a couple of =
weeks ago but the motor quit for only a second or two and then regained =
power.

I am guessing the alternator and/or bushings are going bad. Do you think =
that's right? Another thought just occured...clogged fuel filter? I was =
low on gas (~3 gal left) any connection?
