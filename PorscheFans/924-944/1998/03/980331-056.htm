All

It looks like I just got some air in the system because after bleeding
and the test drive, the car was still running a little warm, ie.,
climb to almost the second mark at idle, but a little revs would
QUICKLY bring the temp back down.  The next morning, I checked the
coolant and saw that it was low again.  After adding more distilled
water, the coolant level is stable and the temp is holding steady a
little above the bottom white mark.  I'm going to give it one more
bleed this coming weekend after jacking the back of the car up as high
as I can get it, as suggested by Jim Richmond.

Also a back fill directly into the block via the hoses was suggested,
but it doesn't look like I'll have to get that drastic.
