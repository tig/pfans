Is there really ANY region that would allow this?  I thought they were =
all
covered by the same liability insurance carrier.  In our region (PNW) we
are not supposed to get any closer than within 50 feet of another =
vehicle.
There is absolutely no racing and no passing except for designated
zones... and then only when the driver you are passing acknowledges that
he saw your pass signal.  No acknowledgment, no pass.

There is also no timing.  To me, timing in a DE would be useless.  There
are enough cars on the track that at times you get slowed down by the
slower drivers, so it is virtually impossible to get an accurate time
anyway.

As I recall from last year, we did have one "DE" day that was listed as a
time trial where only one or two cars were on the track at the same time.
But even on that day, I do not believe there was any official timing =
done,
it was just a way to give each driver a few clear laps.
