>>Someone said they had good results with the H4 Autopal lights. Can you
>>confirm this?

Hey Joe, this is Lenny. It was I who said the comments on the Autopal H4
lamps. It was priced at $20 US fm Auto Atlanta, 770-427-2844 when I
ordred them. The kit includes two (02) lamp lens/reflector bowl
assemblies, two (02) H4 55/60W halogen bulbs, and two (02) small
tungsten pilot lamp bulbs that insert to the lower half of the reflector
bowl. You wire the pilot lamps to the parking lamps yourself. I used
regular terminal lugs and a crimper. Simple Simon!

Well, you know how when you activate the full headlight system, the
headlight pods rises up. So, ok, when you douse the main headlights and
shift to just the parking lamps, the headlight pods remain elevated.
It's during this time when the small parking pilot lamps give off a soft
white glow in the reflector bowl of the headlamps in conjunction w/ the
rest of your parking lamps and side lamps. Then when the whole system is
extinguished the headlamps retract. I'm pretty much pleased w/ the
performance of the illumination capabilities. On low beam it has a nice
wide pattern w/ that extra side cut-out that gives that extra light to
the road shoulder to your right (for those of us who have left-hand
drive vehicles that drive on the right hand side of the road in the US).
I don't think you can specify lens/beam pattern for the type of traffic
you drive in when ordering headlamps fm most major companies w/in the
US. Anyway, on high beam, the beams shift to a tight pencil pattern that
throws a decent illumination far ahead so that you won't over-run your
lights when travelling at high speeds. But since the beams are narrow, I
utilize the built-in driving lamps for wide beam pattern to illuminate
the road shoulders. This helps me keep my orientation of my lane travel
so that I won't "wander" and attract attention to the Troopers (Florida
Highway Patrol). But to be honest to you, if it wasn't for this cosmetic
thing of that silly parking pilot lamp in the reflector bowl, I really
think I would have went with the Bosch H4's, regardless of the price. I
really like the Bosch's  beam spread is on low beam for around-the-town
driving and in bad inclement weather when on the expressways, especially
when the entire roadways are so glossy that you can't really see the
lane markers too well.

Second topic: brake caliper painting. That thought did come to mind and
really I want to do that. However, I think I need to find some
heat-resistant grease to lube up the calipers. I think they're not fully
retracting after use and still (hearing them) slightly touching the
rotors but not as if to lag the car's forward motion. I'm really not
that concerned w/ excessive heat because I'm not that crazy and daring a
driver as some others I know. So, even though I know my brakes won't
heat up too hot, I'll still try to look for some heat resistant paint
just to be on the safe side.  I'll let you know how mine turns out when
it's completed. Keep in touch. :-)
