Casey hi,

With reference about your future purchase. I would go for the later model
the 81 / 82 These have Digital Ignition Timing.

Wheels I can't really help you with, I myself am looking for some 17" or 18"
rims that will fit. 

As for performance, well how much money do you want to spend?

Correct however the GT Carrera  did. Unit cost about 1500 pounds from porsche.
A 944T intercooler can be made to fit, installed in the nose section infront
of the radiator. Which has to be dropped by a couple of inches. Pipe work
is major!

End result is not to hot. The Intercooler is quite large + extra Pipe work
means your Turbo lag goes way up. (I scrapped mine!)

Two other alternatives

a) Charge cooler. Just like a InterCooler only smaller as it uses a coolant
to cool the charge temp. The one I know about is made by 930 Motorsport,
claims Ive heard say the charge temp is dropped by about 45'C

b) Since one of the reasons for fitting a intercooler is to reduce the intake
charge temperature and to stop pre Ignition. One method you may like to 
investigate it water injection. I want to play with this in the near future.
A small pump is used to inject water through a injector into the throttle 
assembly, From what I have seen it has a very dramatic affect depending
just what you mix with the water.

However If your going to increase the power of your engine Think about the
following.

COOLING! 931's can run hot. Think about fitting a 3-core radiator, replace all
cooling hoses and make sure your temperature gauge works. I have also fitted
a cooling fan over ride switch. 

Also listen for any engine knocks from the bottom end. Could be a sign of
worn shells. If you go into the engine for any reason, think about replacing
the pistons with forged pistons. And maybe some head work, O-ringing the 
head would prevent a lot of blown head gaskets if your running high boost.

Other mods worth thinking about

Fit a second fuel accumulator.
Hybrid K26 Turbo.
High lift cam + enlarged exhaust valves etc ....
Waste Gate modifications + Controller (still looking into this one Thanks to
Paragon for responding so quickly NOT!!!)
New Clutch.
Air Filters (no increase in hp but should reduce the T-Lag!)

And a large sticker for the rear hatch saying 
"I eat 911's for breakfast"

Apologies to the Red 911 SC on the A23 Yesterday!

PS does anyone know about fitting a QuickRack to one of these cars.
There is one for a standard 924 but the steering column is different on
turbos?????

Enjoy your new car!

Best regards

Richard.

Series II 931 (taking bets on the dyno results next month!)
