I have a 1984 944 that gets quite wet on the passenger side when it
rains.  I think I actually have two leaks, because both the front carpet
and rear carpet get wet, before the water settles in the low spot behind
the front seat.  I understand that the battery tray is notorious for
corroding and letting water in, and that the sunroof channels is also a
possibility.  Any other "usual suspects?"


Also, my brother in law has a 1988 944, manual transmissions, that needs
to have the gear box/differential assembly replaced.  How much should he
expect to pay for this job?  He was quoted about $2,000.  Is that
reasonable?
