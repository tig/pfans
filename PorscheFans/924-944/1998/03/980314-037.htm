At the risk of offending someone and creating more problems than this
solves--

I spend most of my free time just sorting through the messages, with
usually no time to respond.  Perhaps that is why so many members aren't
active participants.  The effectiveness of the list suffers from
non-technical discussions.  So PLEASE, a few ideas:

*Use the lists that exist for non-technical messages for such purposes.
*Don't copy the whole list on ongoing personal discussions.
*Establish a separate personal list with those members who have the time
for general chat.  
*Use something in the title so we know it's non-technical--perhaps we
could establish a standard.

We should all try to make the titles clear even on technical subjects. 
And even on technical subjects sometimes it's appropriate to email the
person directly instead of the whole list.  Include your email address in
your signature as the digest software sucks.

A little discussion is fine and I'm certainly not perfect.  But I don't
want to read a soap opera.  I have a life outside of this list, but I'd
really like to participate.  Thanks for listening.
