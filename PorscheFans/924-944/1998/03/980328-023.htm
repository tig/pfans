I sent this response privately to Dodge since I thought his response to
me was private. When I saw his message in the digest this morning I
decided I should post this publicly.

I agree. But I can't just sit here and say nothing while someone gets
hurt using this inferior product, particularly when they mount it in
such a way as to be a force multiplier. The Brey Krause bar looks much
more substantial and I'm sure it is. I'm still not sure I'd trust it to
do it's job at the track based upon their 'new' model that is still only
available for the 911. Now, THAT looks substantial. But I had no idea it
would have to be so elaborate to stop the kind of forces we are talking
about.

I am quickly coming to the opinion that so-called safety equipment
should not be allowed unless it is installed properly. That means a roll
bar or cage for a harness. That means a drivers seat with cutouts for
the harness and sub strap. 

That would also probably mean having mandatory seat back braces in all
DE cars...

Sorry to get preachy, but I seem to be on a safety crusade of late. 8-(
