Michael,

	I had 215's on my front Borbet's, and they weren't even close to
rubbing.  225 should be fine but it seems at least one person had a
fitment problem otherwise Tire Rack wouldn't have said anything.  205's
would probably be a "waste" in the sense that you're supposed to be
upgrading in size, and the difference in width between the fronts and
rears would be very significant.  I'd go with 225's but if you're not
feeling lucky, compromise with the 215's.  By the way, I ran 245's in
the rear, and not the 255's.  Tire Rack only recommends 205/255 because
I think that's what 911 applications typically require.

As Mr. Haynes says, "replacement is the reverse of removal."
"War doesn't determine who's right, just who's left."


I'm considering purchasing the Borbet C2 17" wheels for my 85.5 944.
Using
255/40-17 in the rear and 225/45-17 in the front.  The guy at the Tire
Rack
said some people experience tire rubbing using the 225's in the front.
I
think the 205's would be a total waste of money.
