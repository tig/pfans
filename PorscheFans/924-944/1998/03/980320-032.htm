this is in response to Luis de Prat,

  I purchased my 2nd 944 last January and it just happened to be an 83 944
w/87,000miles. The car was raced in its earlier years and has never been
rebuilt! i have had it for a little over a year now and used it as my daily
driver up until i came to school in the begining of September. i have  had no
problems with my car and the car still needs nothing(well it gets TLC always,
but thats a given owning one of these great automobiles!!)  
   I can fully understand where you are coming from by loveing the car!! but 
i think your statement of "Otherwise, get your wallet ready and sign up for a
couple of extra credit cards." i am a freshman in college and bought the car
myself with Cash! and pay all added expenses on the car(insurance, full
coverage, maintenance, gas, etc.) i do not own a credit card and am very glad
that i dont because i dont believe in spending money that you dont have(unless
ABSOLUTALY necessary!; birthdays, etc.) the only reason i would get a credit
card would be because i got paid monthly and not byweekly, and paid the amount
due on time and not have a balance.(my reasoning is because alot of my friends
have credit cards and bought trannys, blowers, paid for head work, etc. and
they are paying the maximum interist for the items and have no cash for
themselves or to just live)  
  I am not ignorant to the fact that my car will need something in the near
future(nock on wood!:> )  I dont agree with your other comment of " the monthly
payments on a newer car simply beat the "Oh no, what now" of my beloved 83."
the payments may be benificial, but you obviously havent checked on the MAJOR
differance on insurance costs! just think you will pay the monthly payments on
the car as well as a major chunk of cash for insurance, when on the other hand
one could purchase an older car for less money, and pay a lesser amount on
insurance! yes its an older car and not a fabulous newer one but its all on how
much money you want to spend!!  i say if you got the cash spend it how you
choose(like you, luis) by all meens, but if your on a budget manage it as best
you can and get the most for it!

Just an FYI!    no harm intended ;)
