Were Porsche parts used for the belt replacement?  Did you replace the
belt more than two years ago?  Porsche parts come with a 2 year warranty,
so (according to the shop that did my belts and is the recommended shop by
the local PCA region) Porsche should pay for parts and labor necessary to
repair your vehicle due to a belt breakage.  I do not know if there is a
catch about whether the shop you used is a Porsche-authorized shop or not.

Good luck.
