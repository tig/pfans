This is NOT the bushing in the A-arm.  It is the caster mounting block =
that
bolts to the body.  I've written about this two or three times as they =
are
recommended parts when upgrading to 17" wheels...  guess nobody is paying
attention :-)  Anyway, the mount attaches to the A-arm rear bushing using=
 a
new eccentric caster adjuster (also an upgraded part).  The mount is as =
you
described above.  Glad they did the trick as I plan to install them =
myself.
