Hello Everyone,

I Just couldn't let this timing belt discussion be dropped so quickly. I am
just getting into my second year of owning this 944. I purchased it with
132,000 miles on it with bad belts, leaky seals, shot water pump, trashed
power steering (drained as fast as I could fill the reservoir), leaking
radiator and a few other things. Lucky for me the clutch job was completed
by Sunset Porsche in Beaverton Oregon one week prior to me coming along. My
previous car was a 1984 Volvo 240 Turbo intercooler running at 12 psi boost.
I got 287,000 miles on that car and replaced 1 radiator, 1 power steering
rack, 1 transmission, 2 clutches, 6 timing belts, 2 water pumps and various
other repairs without any special tools, what a joy to work on. Back to the
944. One week after I got it, I had the waterpump, seals, belts and rollers
replaced for $730. I decided the tensioning tool was to costly to purchase
and didn't want to gamble. I replaced the radiator, steering rack and other
items myself. In the previous year I have put 37,000 miles on my 944 it
needs the belts change desperately. After calling everyone in the book I got
quotes ranging from $210 to $375 for parts and labor to change the timing
and balance shaft belts. This did not include any seals or rollers if
needed. Guess who came in with the $210 quote? Sunset Porsche. With this I
get the factory parts warranty. Engine Builders Supply wanted $48 for the
belts and $89 for one week tensioning tool rental fee. For the extra $73
I'll let the factory trained guys/gals at Sunset do the work. EBS does not
give partial credit for extra days rental. This means that you would have to
get the tensioning tool, do the repairs, put 2500 miles on the car,
retension the belts and get the tool back to them in 7 days or pay another
week's rental fee. EBS ships the tool FedX 2 day air. I did not include
their shipping cost or cost to ship the tool back to EBS. That would eat up
a majority of that $73 difference. Sunset Porsche wants $96 to re-tension
the belts after break in, that's $7 more than two weeks of tool rental from
EBS and none of my time under the hood. The Volvo has about two miles of
clearance between the pistons and valves so a belt failure is not a major
issue. My personal preference is not to flirt with valve-piston marriage on
my 944. To Porsche's credit, the 944's parts are generally cheaper than the
240 Volvo. The craftsmanship and engineering are far superior and with
proper maintenance I will get 300,000 out of the engine. Oh yeah the 944
doesn't handle like a drunk skating on ice.


Hope your still awake, let the flames begin.

M.R.
