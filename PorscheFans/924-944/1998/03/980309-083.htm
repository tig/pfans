In a message dated 98-03-09 21:04:31 EST, you write:

<< Although I don't have any reason to expect my comments will have any effect
 on his behavior, there is always the chance the impossible will occur.
 Perhaps if we are all loud enough, JohnG will actually realize how insanely
 he has been driving. Don't get me wrong, I'm not exactly Mr. Law and Order.
 I'll be the first to admit I rarely drive the speed limit and that I've also
 engaged in many a street race. But drinking and group street racing WILL
 eventually kill someone... and typically it is the innocent who suffer most.

Denny,

You have a real good point.  I admit that I'm one of the guilty parties in
just ignoring what JohnG said instead of voicing my opposition.  Maybe I just
thought he was "blowing smoke" about what happened and he would just go away
if he didn't get the reaction he wanted.  Anyway, you're right.  This type of
activity does only harm to other people and to us, indirectly, as Porsche
drivers.  Yeah, I've also done my share of stupid things . . . . . that's just
part of growing up I guess (the alternative is you kill yourself and never get
a chance to "grow up").

Now we see what happens when there's too much inbreeding . . . . . nature
gives them a frontal lobotomy!
