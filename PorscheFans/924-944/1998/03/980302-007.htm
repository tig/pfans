2 Sugestions (in no particular order)

1: Get out your drill. I've done this when the bolt is stripped from using a
cheap or wore out 12 pt tool. It is fairlly easy to do even with a good tool
as the 12pt recess is fairly shallow. The two times i've done this the
engines were on the stand and there was no problems getting a drill in
there. It will depend on your equipment(right angle drill may be needed. The
head of the bolt is small and dosen't take much drilling to be sucessfull.

2: As you will need to tighten the new one anyway this would be best. You
can probably buy a specialty wrench, however i made one using a cheap socket
and welding a piece of metal to it. Then you can put the 12pt tool through
the drive hole of the socket and you now can back hold the cam assy with the
new wrench. Before welding be sure that the 12pt socket head is long enough
to reach the bolt through the socket and of course fits through the hole.
mine was 3/4" drive. this worked on a SOHC motor and I assume the S2 cam
gear retainer is similar. don't quote me on that. i never even looked at one
that close.

Good luck
Bye for now, Todd
