I was so happy, found a buyer for my computers, took the set I got from the
junkyard
out of my car, put my original computers back in, and what do you know.
Boost is limited
maximum to 1.6 bar and after four seconds of full throttle, the spark gets
shut down to protect?
One set of computers is lying.  If ANYONE has any (valid-sounding) ideas on
what the bleep
may be screwing up in this computer???
Does anyone know who can FIX these machine besides Bosch who charge too
much and I might as well go with some kind of aftermarket setup instead of
doing that but I don't want to!    There is no profit in it!
Must have violated one of the major Rules of Aquisition here.
