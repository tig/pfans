There are no "driving" events in Chicago this time of year, as the weather
is too unpredictable.  However, on Sunday, March 15th, Chicago PCA is
having its 1st St. Patrick's Day party.  It will be held at Bonnie's
Country Cafe and the Illinois Billiard Club in Willow Springs, Il from
2:00-6:00pm.  There will be a conventional Corned Beef and Cabbage meal,
cash bar, and exclusive use of the Billiard Club.

The Illinois Billiard Club is quite a contrast to the image of the old-time
pool room.  No scoundrels or slit-eyed hustlers, or grimy windows.
Instead, there are etched glass and mirrors, mahogany chairs lining the
walls, six-pocket billiard tables and carom tables covered with imported
fabric.  In fact, there is one table designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and
valued at $25,000, and a 1961 Brunswick Gold Crown specimen once owned by
former Cubs pitcher Milt Pappas.

The cost is $30 per person and supposedly the reservation deadline is March
6 (tomorrow), so if anyone wishes to attend, contact Myra Knoblauch (before
9pm Chicago time) at 630-325-1086.  I will be seeing Myra tomorrow evening
at our monthly Board Meeting, so if anyone can't reach her directly, then
e-mail me before 6:30pm tomorrow and I will give her your information.

The next Chicago PCA event after this one is our annual Rallye School on
Sunday, March 22nd.  If anyone needs information on this event (or, any
other Chicago PCA event), just let me know........and, I know some of you
will probably be wondering when the registration forms come out for our
annual Memorial Weekend DE event at Road America - well, they should be in
the March issue of the Chicago Scene, due out within the next week or so.

As always, "Let not the sands of time get in your lunch".
