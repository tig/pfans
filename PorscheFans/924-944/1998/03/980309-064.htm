Chris:
Yes, I replaced the entire axle assemblies because at least one of the
CVs was bad.  I decided since the car has 100K on it all the CVs were
due replacement, and it was cheaper and simpler to just buy the
remanufactured axle assemblies. Each axle assembly has two CVs on it.  I
got a pair of axle assemblies (4 CVs on 2 axles) for just over $300 from
Automotion for my 86 944na.  The job was pretty straight forward, taking
about 3.5 hours to complete.  You just have to make sure you get the
right tool (8mm 12 point socket) for the bolts.  I got mine at Pep Boys
auto in a set of 4 (6mm, 8mm, 10mm, and 12mm) for about $13.50 over in
the VW parts section.  Also, be sure you clean the bolts well with brake
cleaner (You will need 2 cans), and tap the 8mm socket into the bolts to
seat them well so you don't strip them out.

The toughest part to me was putting the new axle assemblies back in.  I
had to push the CVs on each end as far to the center as the would go and
then kinda muscle the transaxle over 1/2 an inch to get the new ones
in.  After I figured that out, it was smooth sailing.  Best of luck to
you.  I recommend you get the FAQ for this procedure.  It is on the web
somewhere (maybe Pfans home page).  Let me know if you can't find it and
perhaps I have it.  Also, the Haynes manual has some nice pictures of
this procedure.  Best of luck!
