But how experienced are you with the Porsche 944?  Ever since these cars
came out, the timing belt has been a major problem.  I've been keeping
up with the 944 from the very beginning and I've never, ever heard
anyone that really knows these cars recommend tensioning by "feel".  On
the contrary, the real experts advise to ALWAYS use the tension gauge. 
These are the same people who have seen time and time again the damage
caused by tensioning by "feel".  Your 944 may be running OK now, but
report back when you've put another 30,000 miles on it.  That is, if the
belt makes it that far.  On second thought, consider not reporting back,
ever.
