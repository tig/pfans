Howdy,

Since we are all geared up about power right now, why don't we get some of
you guys to take your cars out to the nearest DynoJet facility and give
us all some numbers to play with.

There are specifically two items I want numbers for:
1. Jon Milledge chips for an "S" car, all else being stock.
2. Weltmeister chips for an "S" car, all else being stock.

All runs should be done in 4th gear once car has reached operating
temperature,
all runs should have a boost gauge attached outside the car so you can see
what the peak boost level is.

Take a disk with you and save the files so you can email them to me so I
can have fun playing with the numbers and graphs.

If anyone meets the above car type and is willing to do the dyno test,
I would be willing to share some of the cost, as long as I can get my
hands on the computer dyno files.  I'm losing my patience at waiting for
people to do this on their own and I don't feel like buying $2000 worth
of chips just to see who really makes the most power and at what boost
level.

Farzaan.
