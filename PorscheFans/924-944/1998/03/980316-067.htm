Hi P-Fans,

Detectors are legal in the US, except for the District of Columbia and the
state (exceuse me, Commonwealth) of Virginia.  I was stopped in Virginia
last year for _having_ a radar detector.  It was off and obviously not
plugged in, but the officer said that it had "access to a power supply" and
was therefore illegal.  He recorded the serial number and stated that the
next time that detector was found in Virginia, it would be destroyed.  He
also lightened my wallet of $75.00.  Incidently, this officer alternately
followed me, paralleled me, and led me for almost 15 minutes before pulling
me over just as I was about to leave his jurisdiction.  

So happy I was able to contribute,

-Bill
