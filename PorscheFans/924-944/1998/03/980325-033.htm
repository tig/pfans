Rich -

The Parade this year, I think, was allowing 750 entrants.  That means a
possible 1500 people if each entrant has a co-entrant.  Having served on
past Parade staffs, facilities is the usual reason for limiting the size
of the Parade.  750 is one of the bigger ones.  Try putting on a dinner
for over 1500 people and having everyone either receive warm/prepared
food, see the head table, guest speaker or any presentation.  And then
think about holding a three day autocross for 1500 people or doing a rally
for 750 cars.  Granted, not all of them do all events or any events but
the possibility is there and past percentages give the Parade staff their
ability to estimate how many entrants they can handle. 

The reason you are probably on the waiting list is that you are from one 
of the local areas.  There is a national procedure to see who gets into 
Parade.  Off of the 750 comes the National officers and staff, then the 
Zone Reps and Regional Presidents.  After that they take 4 entrants from 
each region drawn at random.  If Parade is not filled at this point, they 
continue to take regional entrants from the regional pool.  It is a 
pretty well thought out procedure.

Now, dealing with you personally, since you're in the locale of the Parade
and most of your regional members also signed up you just missed the cut. 
If they didn't limit the number of entrants to each region, the regions
closer to the site, where people can attend easily, would fill it up each
year.  Past experience is that usually quite a few that entrants drop out 
along the way. 

Now, I say all this with the side remark that a Parade hasn't been filled 
for a number of years.  But then we haven't had a Parade in the middle of 
the country for some years which seems to be a popular decision.

Hope you get in as Parade is a great experience and yes, I'm planning on 
a nice vacation in Colorado.
