TO: K L Wang

I was offered a great job about 18 months ago in D. C. Drove my Porsche
to the interview from Florida --- great trip.

I was about beat to death on the pot holed streets - parked in some very
nasty areas. Was offered the job at about twice what I am making in
Florida - but declined. Driving in the general area was very very bad
and I lived in Chicago for 11 years. I did run through the Virginia area
and had a blast. I don't understand how our nations capital can have
such bad roads.
