Some time ago the list talked about cars leaking gas out the filler neck 
during vigorous driving. (auto-x, barhopping, etc) One listmember of German 
extraction reported a cure involving "der garage raggen".( Porsche special 
tool # MY-951-lks4auto-x) His cure was to simply stuff "der garage raggen" 
around the fuel filler neck and the twist on the cap, (before hard driving).

I have found and tested a better, more permanent solution. Remove your gas cap 
and look at the end of your fuel filler neck. You should notice an elongation 
of the circular shape near the bottom of the opening. Now place der garage 
raggen over the out of round portion of the neck, covering both the inside and 
outside of the threaded cap area. This is where you use a second special 
Porsche tool, " der channels lokken"! Get a grip on the neck through der 
garage raggen mit der channels lokken. Now gently bend the elongated area back 
to a circle. The threads on the neck are quite coarse, so this should not 
affect the cap going on. 
This somewhat technically challenging repair method sealed my tank from any 
further deposits on the right rear quarter panel during auto-x....
