Images of oil pouring on the floor polute my dreams.


I've assembled the lower half of my engine w/ exception of the pistons.  I
still have the scent of orange loctite 574 in my head.  By god, if you sniff it
long enough it smells like oranges...

Everything went fairly well.  The manual says to wack the lower crank-case
section to align it with the front of the crank-case.  All of my wacking
wouldn't budge the damn thing, so there is a slight lip (very slight) between
the two sections.  I liberally applied 574 on the oil pump sealing surface to
try and make up for the gap.

I'm a little worried about how it'll seal against the block...

I've got to trust myself.  I've popped the oil pump open ten times to make sure
I put the big gear in properly (little dot facing out, right?)

I'm also a little worried about my compression ratio.  The cylinder head has
been milled twice now...and the deck has been done too.  I may be looking into
that thick head gasket...

FWIW,

The total to get my rotating mass balanced, polished and fitted (the pins),
ended up being $300.  This included cleaning the parts.  Anything to make my
girlfriend happy (bad joke).

Oh, and if Jason Burkett is reading this, I'm missing a lower balance shaft
seal!!!!

Future plans???

Get engine built by weekend, put into car during the weekend... (oh, I have to
get the dang clutch :()  So things maybe a little behind...
