Dear Bill...

I had this problem on my '91 S2.  It turned out that one of the small
plastic clips that retains the flapper door to direct heat output had
broken.... thus not securing to the rod which is actuated by a small motor.


My symptom was EXACTLY as you described... the heater was full blast... no
matter what the temperature setting was.  Go into the driver's footwell,
and look up at the side towards the console.  There is a small motor there
with a rod which is at one end attached to it's rotating arm, and at the
other attached to the flapper door for the heater core.  I will bet you
find a problem here with the rod not actuating the flapper door... hence
constant heat directed into the car.

Hope this helps.
