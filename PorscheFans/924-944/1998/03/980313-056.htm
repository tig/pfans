Hello Reinhard
	Your S2 should idle smooth. I suspect the primary side of the ignition system
is bad!  Try checking/replacing the spark plug (is the gap OK?) or plug wires,
cap & rotor. If you can not see the tach move at idle, but feel the engine
miss, it most likely a ignition misfire. 

	You could also have some carbon build up on the valves, but I would suspect
that is not that common in Germany the way you guys drive on the autobahn. Our
US low speed driving makes carbon build up more of a problem here. What about
vacuum leaks? can you hear any sucking noises under the hood? 

Good Luck
