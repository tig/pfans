I have purchase the A-Pillar Boost Gauge mount from Vision Motorsports.=
  At
first, I  did not like the mount but have found a way to make it work a=
nd look
stock.  First of all, there are cheaper places to purchase the mount an=
d gauge
from.  Try Burschur Racing at  http://www.buschurracing.com/.  I believ=
e that
they will sell you the gauge and install kit for $55.00 and the a-pilla=
r mount
for around $20.00.  Far cheaper than Vision at $90.00 and it is the exa=
ct same
thing.  You will need to purchase a "tee" that does not come with the k=
it.   I
believe that Extreme Motorsports  http://www.extrememotorsports.com/ind=
ex.htm
sells the  same thing and includes a "tee" and some adhesive and primer=
 as well.

Be aware that the a-pillar mount that you are buying was not made to fi=
t your
car.  If you are patient you can make it look stock (by this I mean mak=
e it
look like it fits in, a part of the car).  I cut the back down using a =
tin
snips and then angled the bottom to fit the angle where the a-pillar me=
ets the
dash.  I also sanded this with a sanding block and some 120/220 grit pa=
per to
make things smooth.  Here's the big secret.  The contour of the mount d=
oes not
match the contour of our a-pillar.  The plastic that this mount is made=
 from is
a thermoset plastic meaning that it can be re-heated and then reformed.=
  What I
did was to use a commercial hot air gun, heat the a-pillar mount up and=
 then
press it against the a-pillar so that it conforms how I want it to.  Do=
 not
use too much pressure on your finger tips or they will imprint onto the=
 mount.
You will probably have to re-heat and reform a number of times to get i=
t just
right.

Stick gauge into mount.  I does not fit exactly and requires some sandi=
ng out
of the hole to make work.  I used a dremel tool and just ran it around =
the hole
for a brief period of time.  It does not go all the way in and you will=
 see a
slight amount (1/8" or so) of the aluminum side of the gauge.  I used a=
 small
paint brush and painted it black to blend in with the gauge face.

Attach the wires for the light (ground to a good ground, tap into radio=
 light
for the the light).

Attach hose.  Be careful, the hose that comes with the kit kinks easily=
 and
replacement hose is hard to find.  I attached the other end to one of t=
he
vacuum lines coming off of the manifold.  Between cylinders 3 & 4 is a =
banjo
bolt with 2 lines coming out of it.  One line goes to the computer, the=
 other
tees and goes to the fuel regulator and somewhere else.  I followed thi=
s line
that went somewhere else and tapped into.  Hope this was right.

To mount the gauge, I used 3M 4951 double sided foam tape.  You can cho=
ose any
type of adhesive.  I chose this because I want  to have the option of r=
emoving
it at a later date without ruining the a-pillar.  This tape has a thin =
profile
and is plasticizer resistant.  I applied 3M primer 94 to the mount and =
heated
it slightly with an air gun to dry.  I then applied the tape to the mou=
nt and
heated that with an air dryer.  Wait 1 hour.  Apply primer 94 to the A-=
pillar
where the tape will come in contact and heat with the gun to dry.  Appl=
y
a-pillar and you are done.

Looks good and I like the location.  I use the area under my radio for =
other
things so the a-pillar mount worked well.  Any questions, e-mail.  Sorr=
y about
the length.
