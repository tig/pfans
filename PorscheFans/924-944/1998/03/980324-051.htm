In our region, a novice driver at DE will probably stay in the green
(novice) group with an instructor for 3 or 4 events, will graduate to the
blue (intermediate) group and will stay there with an instructor for 3 or 4
more events before being promoted to solo status. If the student attends
all of our DE's during this  period, it will take 1 to 2 years to be
allowed to solo. Furthermore, there is no "social promotion" to solo: if
the student can't drive well enough and safely enough, he or she may stay
in an instructed group forever. We also make this clear to the novice
students, so they aren't expecting rapid promotion.

The number of students that require instructors for any event is limited by
the number of instructors that sign up for the event. No instructor gets
more than two students, and each student gets 3 runs of about 1/2 hour each. 

Of course, we are blessed with great weather (Florida) and we have about 70
active instructors. 

I don't want to be overly critical, but I'd be concerned about the school
you attended from a safety point of view.

Mike
