Cool! As a member of the Rocky Mt Region, which is hosting this party (not
that I'm doing any of the work), I'll show up w/ a bottle of Jose Cuervo or
several and a sack of limes.  The Sheraton also has several decent-sized
bars that won't be overrun w/ shredders during the summer.

What's a Porsche parade anyway? Do you get to drive fast? Do you have
libations before or after?
