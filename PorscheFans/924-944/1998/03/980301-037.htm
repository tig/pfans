Hi Pfans...

Well, for once I have a happy story to report, that also contains my
usual amount of ranting about the lousy drivers in this town.

As I was driving home this afternoon, I encountered an Oldsmobile
Ninety-Eight, staffed by a crew of four people whose ages appeared to
also be ninety-eight or higher. Needless to say, it was doing 20 in a 45
zone, with, of course, the right blinker on to keep their pacemakers in
sync. Another moron in a Caddy was tailgating them. The road was a
moderately travelled two-lane no-passing zone. Once again, I reiterate
my rant: "HANG UP THE PHONE AND DRIVE, PEOPLE!"

The guy in front of me took the initiative to pull around this
particular cruise ship, and disappeared off on a side street. I
followed, passing on the left over a double yellow line, noticing too
late that the vehicle heading toward me contained an esteemed
representative of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department. I saw
him turn on his lights in my rear view mirror and was sitting on the
side of the road waiting for him before he turned around. He managed to
accelerate up to about 60, planning on chasing me down, so it was kind
of funny to watch him lock up his brakes to stop in time.

To make a long story short, the officer actually listened with interest
to my explanation, checked my license to make sure I wasn't a member of
the Lompoc Prison Escapee's Club, and remarked "There's a lot of old
people who drive on this road, and they don't pay a lot of attention."
He then gave me back my license and reg, wished me a good day, and went
on his way, without giving me a ticket. Absolutely amazing.

Life is good.

Alex.
