Dear PorscheFans, 

I have enjoyed reading the digest on a daily basis, many great discussions, 
thank you. I went through a bad experience, in the process I lost sleep and
money but gained friendship and knowledge. I would like to share the story with
you, but it's a bit long so you are warned.

About a year ago I purchased a 1989 951. The car had 110,000 miles and needed a lot of 
TLC. So after taking care of A-arms, belts, hoses, water pump, brakes...
the car was braught back to a very good shape. What originally was a great deal,
soon became marginal. 
(LESSON #1: START WITH A CLEAN CAR EVEN IF THE PRICE IS HIGHER!).

During my second driver event I noticed a puff of blue smoke, between gear 
changes. So I go looking for a fix to the problem, and that's where the 
NIGHTMARE began.

Most shops diagnosed the problem as worn valve guides and/or turbo seals. Few 
shops thought the Oil rings were gone. I wanted to fix/overhaull all of the above, 
but based on a recommendation of a local shop a valve job was performed and the 
turbo was rebuilt (labor done by the shop).  Now the car no longer "puffs" blue
smoke, but it blows smoke like never before. Oil consumption was 1qt/100 miles! 
After investigation, it was decided that the problem is in the head, so we pull
the head off for the second time to find bad guides. Another valve job was 
performed and the car is blowing so much smoke I refused to drive it. 

Frustration level is high, I'm missing driver events, no one can fix my car. I
decide to rebuild the whole engine, and I wanted to go with a 2.8L stroker. I
got few estimates from various shops. Mr. Milledge was my choice, but we had a
conflict in schedules, so I kept looking. I got in touch with "Cyntex, Inc." in
PA, Paul one of the owners was a great help, he knew his stuff and he was really
easy to work with. I wanted him to rebuild the engine, and I was to deliver the
car to him, but the delivery of my new trailer was delayed, and I could not 
drive the car from NC to PA so I restart my search. A friend points me in the 
direction of a BMW tuner in NC. The guy had a good reputation, but never been 
inside a Porsche engine, I take a chance on him and I get Paul at Cyntex to 
agree on helping the BMW guy during the rebuild (Thanks Paul, not many people 
will do this!!!!). 
The rebuild took over 6 months, the price fluctuated all over the place. I 
started to get nervous, as things were not going well, my confidence in the 
rebuild was deteriorating faster and faster. I had to cancel the 2.8L stroker 
(even though I had purchased all the major parts). The Builder could not
remove the original studds so the RaceWare studds had to be returned to PARAGON
long after the purchase date (thanks Jason). Well you get the idea!!!

I got my car back, it was running like an old truck! I didn't care, I had to 
get my car back! After spending many evenings reworking vacuum line connections,
reworking connections to auxiliary water pump.... My car is running the way it
should be. (Funny, I was charged an extra 20 hours to hook everything back up!)

(LESSON #2: TAKE YOUR CAR TO A REPUTABLE PORSCHE SHOP OR ELSE! )

Well enough sad stories, let's start with the good stuff. During the process, I
got in touch and became friend with many PorscheFans regulars. I would like to 
thank everyone that helped me (emotionally and technically) during this 
nightmare. Many thanks to Chris Hanlon, Don Istook, Jim Richmond, Bob Norman, Jason Lee, 
Jason at PARAGON, Paul at Cyntex, Dale Fazekas  as well as many others.

During the rebuild I upgraded the turbo to a K27-K26#8, Milledge Oil Pan, 
ported intake & throttle body & O-ringed head by Cyntex. A new chip will be burned by
Cyntex on the 3rd of April. I'll post the dyno results.

I still need to install the Accusump, additional Oil Cooler and the Air/Oil seperator.
Next project is a 3.0L turbo, and it'll be done by a PORSCHE specialist this time. (Well 
I have to do something with the 3.0L block, Carrillo rods, 2.7L head).

(LESSON #3: PORSCHE THERE IS NO SUBTITUTE.)

Thanks for listening, and stay tuned for the dyno results. Next message will be shorter!
