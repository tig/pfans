Jeff,

It is not necessary to remove the engine to replace the oil pump seal.  You do 
need to remove the crankshaft pulley which is a bear.  I ended up removing the 
radiator to get enough room for my impact wrench.  Once the pulley is off you 
remove the woodruff key and [memory fails here - I think there may be a piece 
bolted to the front of the engine which comes off to reveal the seal].  I 
remember pulling the seal by screwing a small sheet metal screw into it for a 
handle.

Installing the new seal is a little tricky.  You hold the seal in place and use 
a small wooden stick to work the inner lip over the cylindrical shell on the ID 
(you will see this when you open 'er up).  Slather some fresh oil on the seal 
for lubrication during installation.

Incidentally, pulling the radiator made some more space in which to work.

Have fun,
John (89 944)
