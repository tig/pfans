Good Luck!

I was too scared to try this.  The final fear came from two places:

1) A. Bauer Porsche Repair.  You can see their ad in Excellence (the black car
is built from an '89 I wrecked at Laguna and sold to them).  Anyway, the
quoted a friend for removal and install with the Raceware units.  The had a
hell of a time, and lost money.  My friend made out.

2) Jon Milledge.  Jon is the #1 944/951 engine builder in the country.  He
told me to heat the rascals.  He said: if you can't get them out, or get at
them with heat, you'll have to take the motor out.

Jon told me he has lots of data on the studs.  He says they should ideally be
replaced each time. He is working on a set of his own design, so I'd give him
a call before you bust open the package of Raceware studs.

I hope that it goes well.  Success stories will make me less frightened.

- Mike
