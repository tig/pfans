I sit here, as an American who loves cars, and ponder the meaning of a man's
life.  A man seperated from me by generations, a man who lived thousands of
miles away speaking a different language and living in a different culture.  

Yet, we understand each other.  Or at least, I understood him.  

From the beginnings in Gmund where Ferry frantically worked to prepare the
first 356s to sell for funds to help pay for legal defense of his father who
sat in a French prision accused of war crimes in the late 1940's, to the
unveiling of the first 550s and 911's decades later, to the great Porsche cars
of endurance racing, to the time when Porsche looked as if it were to become a
page in history, I understand the man and his dreams.  

He was an engineer, an artist, a businessman, and a father of ideas that mold
the automotive world even today.  I saw his objectivity, his truth, his
beauty.  He made the Porsche car different from all the rest- a testament to
the power of the human mind. Not thinking about being flashy, not thinking
about the capitalization and profit the other car makers pursued, Ferry showed
that a car could go beyond the transportaion that so many saw- a hunk of metal
to be used and thrown away.  He made cars meaningful without catering to the
needs of just the ultra-rich, and made a real sports car a possibility for the
middle class.

In his time, he saw Porsche beat all marques, produce the finest sports cars,
and saw the average man being able to enjoy the best in quality and
engineering.  Porsche was more a family than a corporation under his hand, and
today I hope his spirit lives on in the minds of those who control the company
today. 

So, as an American, I sit here and understand the beauty of what a man
invisoned and created for those smart enough to notice it- excellence that is
inclusive rather than exculsive, engineering that is purposeful not
superficial, power with perception rather than irresponsibility.  And above
all, beauty than is objective rather than subjective.   

A Porsche is not a car.  It is a state of mind.  And this will live on in me,
always.
