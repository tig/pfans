Pfans,

I just replaced the passenger side fog light in my '86 turbo.  The lens   
was cracked along with the right side trim piece.  (There are two trim   
pieces that attach to either side of the lens for cosmetic purposes to   
fill the lens area).
    

Does anyone have a spare right side of the passenger fog light trim   
piece?
Can I have it?

By the way, I bought the lens (only) from PAR for 93.50.  Dealer list is   
148.  One problem is that it doesn't come with the trim pieces.  The   
other problem I had was that when I tried to unscrew the lens portion   
from the housing, 2 out of four bolts twisted off at the head and one   
broke off the entire plastic female part.  So, a 15 minute project turned   
into a 1.30 project, as I drilled the remaining screws out (my dog was   
going nuts at the sound of my dremel tool at 10k rpm) and finally put the   
lens back in.  I had to use self tapping screws in two of the holes.  So,   
you may want to buy the whole unit.  I wonder if my new lens is going to   
go flying out under hard deceleration.  Also, the bulb does not work now,   
and it did before.  Are you not supposed to touch these things with   
fingers?
