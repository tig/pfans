I was brainstorming with some figures re offset... Mike Morriset was 
asking about the usage of the same for AutoX, and my first reaction was 
to check the offset of the rims he was being offered... 
I checked one of the previuos postings on the list and thanks to Ike 
Moola and his list I checked the existence of 2 differnt offsets for the 
cookies...6J @36mm and 7J @ 23.3mm. Also on the automotion catalogue 
they give a different number for the cookies, this one being  125mm of 
offset. 

Now it gets weird.. after using the Automotion catalogue and their 
manner of mesure the rim offset I came with 13.5cm or around 135 mm of 
offset for my phonedials the 6J15 giving a 10mm or roughly 1cm of wrong 
offset . 

Now George B. was talking of rubbing and I ask where it should be the 
rubbing, on the wheel well or the lip of the fender ? This rubbing is 
counting which size of tires ??? regular 195X65X15 ?? or a differnt set 
up like 205X50 or 195X50???

Also Ike, it seems that the 7J 15 from the 944 and 944S 1987 they fit on 
the 924S asa well . 

If you guys can shed me some light on this one ...And sorry for the BW..
