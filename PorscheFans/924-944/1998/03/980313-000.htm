For auto-x I prefer open face, it's lighter, gives best peripheal vision,
cooler (and your mouth exhales directly to the air, not inside your helmet
and easiset to put on eye/sunglasses. You're unlikely to ever collide into
something so hard that you would need the mouth protection.

If you're gonna be on the racetrack alot, some prefer the added safety net
of mouth protection. I still prefer open, as I have no plans for wheel to
wheel racing. Also when you you have to talk to someone, eg. outside of
the car or in-car to an instructor or student it's easier to be heard and
to hear.

Well just today my Bell Mag 5 arrived that has had a custom paint
job complete with PORSCHE logos along each side. Don't most rally drivers
where open? Well if it's safe enough for them then it's safe enough for
me. 

Summit Racing prices are pretty cheap as they cater to the Detroit Iron
crowd. Mag 4 lists in their catalog for $175. You could call and ask them
to get a price on a Mag 5, it's not in their catalog. Cheapest price I
recall was $230. (330)630-3030
