     The fix below may or may not fix your noise problem.  I have done the 
     belt job many times on my 951 and i found that you can properly setup 
     using the gauge (i have one) and the Porsche roller setting tool, and 
     still have the noise.  Some times the belt would be silent and some 
     times it would sound like a jet engine.  
     
     The only sure fire method is to setup the belts and rollers per 
     factory specs, install the intercooler plumbing and start the car 
     without the belt covers.  You can watch the belt as you rev the motor 
     to see if you get any standing waves on the belt.  If you do, readjust 
     the roller and try agian.  There is more than one way to have the 
     correct reading on the gauge.  Make sure you cover the intake of the 
     airflow sensor with a piece of nylon stocking or equivalent to prevent 
     sucking in junk.  BTW this is a great way to observe the action of 
     your airflow sensor plate as you rev the motor.  The S2 may be easier 
     beacuse there is no intercooler plumbing.
     
     Also, if you have used the gauge before, you know that using it takes 
     some skill.  It is not that simple to get a consistent reading.  You 
     must get multiple readings on differing points on the belt to be 
     convinced that your are reading what you are reading.  There is VERY 
     little adjustment on the tensioner to go from 2.7 to 4.0.  Using the 
     guage is not that easy!

     Subject: 944 S2 Camshaft Drive Belt Noise - the Fix
     
     As reported in Technical Bulletin #9208:
     
     Models affected: 944 S2 1989-1991
     
     Concern:  Camshaft belt noise noticeable at approximately 1800 rpm 
     with
     the engine at operating temperature.
     
     General Information:  Oscillations in the camshaft drive belt 
     occurring
     between the crankshaft and the cam belt tensioning roller can create = 
     noise
     with the engine at operating temperature and engine speed of = 
     approximately
     1800 rpm.  This noise can be effectively reduced or eliminated by 
     adjusting the camshaft belt tension using special too 9201.
     
     Work Procedure:  yadda, yadda, yadda   5.  Using special tool 9201, = 
     adjust
     the camshaft belt tension to scale value 4.0-4.3. 
     -------------------------------
     
     Since I am experiencing just such a noise after my new cam belt was 
     retensioned using only the built-in spring adjuster, I'm going to ask 
     the
     shop to do it again with the gauge.  Don't know why they didn't do it 
     =
     that
     way in the first place since they used the gauge on the balance shaft 
     belts, but maybe they don't have access to the tech bulletins and were 
     =
     not
     aware of the procedure change.
     
     Notice the recommended tension.  This is the same for a new belt. 
     Normally a new belt that has been run for 1800 miles should be = 
     retensioned
     to 2.7 after an initial setting of 4.0.  Anyway, I'm tired of the 
     noise.
