>he suggests scotch bright for cleaning
metal as it will not remove metal. I am under the impression that this is=

not
true, and that it will in fact remove metal just fine, especially aluminu=
m.
Many people seem to think it is just a hard plastic miracle cleaner or
something, but to the best of my knowledge it is actually very hard
abrasive
imbedded in a resinous coating.<



I should of explained in more detail about the Scotchbrite.  I would use
contact cleaner or solvent with a green Scotchbrite pad to clean the buil=
t
up carbon from the tops of the cylinder walls, the tops of the pistons an=
d
from the heads.  Depending on how the cylinders looked, I would probably
lightly go over them paying a bit more attention to the bottom of the bor=
es
below the ring travel.  Yes, if you rub hard and long enough, you can tak=
e
off metal but you should not be able to remove enough metal to affect the=

silicon particles.

The blocks are made of Reynolds 390? aluminum alloy which has a high
silicon content.  It is my understanding that the rings ride on exposed
silicon particles.  The particals also do an excellent job of holding a
film of oil.  Silicon being very hard is the reason our engines last such=
 a
long time.  The bores can be honed but require a special hone that remove=
s
the aluminum and leaves the silicon exposed.

As with most advice, do not try this at home unless supervised by a paren=
t
or legal guardian.
