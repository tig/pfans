Hi fellow PFANS

Here in the midwest, the weather has been much warmer than usual and my 83 NA
944 picked the right time to blow a window motor. Driver's side. Got one
coming in the mail, and would like some info about R/R. I know how to get the
door panel off, but am concerned that I will need power tools to disengage the
regulator and get the motor off when the time comes.

BTW, this sucker was a $184 new Bosch unit from Performance Products bought
only 2 years ago. I'm wondering what went wrong? The regulator might need some
grease, but I expected A LOT more life out of that motor.

Fortunately, I know more sources for parts than I did then, so the new one was
"only" $110 from Vertex, in Miami, FL. Any info about R/R would be


About wheels, someone posted about having phone-dial wheels refinished. I have
cookies, but had them beautifully restored by Rennsport, in Roswell GA. They
send you the wheels and you ship yours back. It costs $100/corner, and was a
dramatic change in my 14 year old car.

Check them out.
