Hey Joe (Kind of has a ring to it.....hope he doesn't shoot his old lady)

If you want to see what this list 'might' turn in to check out the BMW list.
it's a true pain in the butt to read and reliable technical help is about 2%
of the content. Lots of wining about M3's new illuminated shift pattern
shifter knob. other than that a lot of uncontrolled flaming and useless
yammering. I like our list but it has gotten a lot more traffic in the last
couple of months.
I hope the list stays as is but the trend is going the other way.

Chris White
