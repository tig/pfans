That is a good call, Rich.  Furthermore, IMHO, even with the wheels
balanced well, things can still get screwed up when you put the wheels on
the car.  So my question to the original poster is "Do you have OEM wheel
locks?" If so, where is the valve stem located in relation to the wheel
lock?  Additionally, for the front wheels is the wheel lock installed on
the stud with the red dot on the end of it?

The Porsche wheels locks (at least for my old 87 944S) are twice as heavy
as the accompanying lug nuts (25g vs 12g) and will unbalance the wheel if
not properly installed.  When installing Porsche wheels, align the lug
hole that is adjacent to the valve stem with the painted lug.  Then
install the lock on the painted lug.

You get extra points if the point on the Porsche crest is closest to the
valve stem but that is only for looks, it will not affect the wheel
balance. 

Ride on...
