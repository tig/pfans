I've heard some listers talking about the subject of Porsche vs. BMW, and it's
just silly.  There is no comparasin.  As a BMW and a Porsche owner, I
acknowledge that both have great quality, reliablity, engineering.  But BMW is
NOT A SPORTS CAR.  Almost any Porsche can beat a BMW (just look at the stats).
My 86 951 with a automotion chip can beat a modern (98') M3.  Porsche has long
battled BMW in racing, but Porsche always seems to win.  I have a 70' 2800 CS,
the car that was first campaigned by BMW in ETC against Porsche.  The result:
humilating defeat at the hands of 934 and 935's.  

Look at modern racing as well.  In IMSA BMW puts a full factory effort into
beating Porsche privateers (Like L. Shumacher) and can barely wrestle away a
few wins, usually.  

BMW was the first to use turbos on it's cars, but abandoned it because of the
fact in-line engines (6 cylinders) don't do well with turbos.  Porsche 951's
are superior engines to almost any BMW six I can think of, even with the lag.
A 3.2 liter BMW  M six gets a 240hp (US, Euro 300).  That on a car weighinh
3200lbs.  A Porsche 951 gets a healthy 220hp of 2.5 liters, with a
2800-2900lbs weight.  You do the math.

BMW makes the best sport sedans in the world, Porsche the best sports cars.
There is a big difference.  As Porsche Purists, we see the light of a REAL
sports car, not a tuned sedan.  Just the fact that a 951 S can kill a modern
M3 ten years newer should be enough to shut up any BMW fanatic.  We preach
mutual respect, but the BMW is in the rear view mirror.

And a 325is can't beat a stock 944 of the same year.  Look at R&T for god's
sakes!
