David,

That advice may have saved you more than money. At the 48 hours at Sebring,
David Bassett (Suncoaster from Bradenton) had the same problem, only his
car didn't quit running, it just ran poorly. With the timing way off, the
catalytic converter heated to extreme temperatures, started a fire which
was very difficult to extinguish due to the heat. His fuel line then split
and he had a pretty big fire. Car was repairable and his insurance covered
it. Sure messed up his weekend, and it was all due to the set screw in the
rotor!

Mike
