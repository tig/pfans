The hood has been repainted, with an improper job being done.

Factory paint jobs do not check, whether on a hot car or a car that's not so
hot.
The hood foam was for sound insulation, not heat, and is not supplied on
cars starting around 1988-89.

> The car is a newly acquired 1986 944 NA with very low miles (but unwisely
> stored outdoors for about seven years). The exterior, including the red
> paint, is in fine shape, except in places on the engine hood. Toward the
> nose and in a small spot on the aft end of the hood, passenger side, the
> paint has gone orangish and shows "check cracking" (a faint pattern of
tiny
> jigsaw-like etchings). It looks as though it has been baked from
> overexposure to engine heat.
>
> Under the hood the insulation lining has mostly disintegrated. Was this
heat
> or sound insulation? Did its deterioration lead to cooking the paint?
>
> I took the car to a Porsche mechanic who finds the engine in excellent
> condition, and it shows no signs of overheating.
