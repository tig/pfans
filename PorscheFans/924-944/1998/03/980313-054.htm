I am not trying to flame anyone or start a flame war but in my opinion =
the list shouldn't be reserved for just tech questions. I could be way =
off base as I wasn't a member from the beginning. I realize that 100+ pos=
tings is a daunting task to get through each day so I agree there should =
be some degree of focus. However, I truly enjoy reading the road stories =
as well as the tech questions. And lets face it no one, let me be clear, =
NO ONE reads the general, flamers, or tavern list. Well ok maybe two of =
you. :-)  I really don't want to subscribe to those lists on the off chan=
ce someone relates a 944 road story or joke, etc.

To help cut down on the length of the list we could be more concise as =
to how much we quote. Some of us have gotten a bit carried away with quot=
es and don't think about how long it takes to sort through it all.

I am not sure I have an answer for Don's dilemma but we could help him =
out by CC'ing to him any questions we think he might could help on. I app=
reciate his help and don't want to lose his input.

I don't have all the answers but I would hate to see one of the good qual=
ties of this list get snuffed out. It just wouldn't be the same. Any othe=
r thoughts?
