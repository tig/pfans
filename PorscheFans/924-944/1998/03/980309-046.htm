I just pulled the fuel tank in my 924 NA (not an S but I'd guess 
they're similar?) and I'm pretty sure there's only two features 
between the tank top and the load floor.  One is the sender unit, and 
I guess it's not this, as it's under a big plastic bung and quite 
accessible from the top, so you looked already....The other is the 
vent (breather?) pipe which, following its path from the 
tank, connects to an elbow stub pipe near the front left area of 
the tank which comes up out of a recess in the top of the tank then 
goes 90 degs to point right (across the car, toward the filler neck). 
 The fuel pipe fixes to this with a worm drive hose clip.  After 
about 8 inches another hose clip connects it to a  moulded plastic 
"chamber", whose purpose remains a mystery to me...any 
offers?...about 12 inches long and of vaguely triangular section, 
maybe 2 inches per side. At the other end of this another hose clip 
puts us back in good ol' fuel pipe and takes us back into view in the 
filler neck area.  Maybe your rattle is a hose clip which has got 
moved?   Worst case I can think of is you broke off the elbow from 
the tank (I Really hope not!).  If you can identify this line at the 
point where it connects to the filler neck and disconnect it, blowing 
on it may show if it's disconnected anywhere.  Don't Smoke. 
Be lucky.
