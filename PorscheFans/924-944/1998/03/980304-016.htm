I have seen many postings on replacing the clock bulb, I have another p=
esky
bulb question.  My low fuel indicator light fails to come on anymore.  =
Any
suggestions as to what the problem might be and the fix to it?

Someone mentioned the wax problem at a car wash.  I would try a couple =
of
different things.  First route would be to use a heavy concentration of=
 Dawn
(or Ivory) dish soap in water and wash the car.  Dawn is a grease strip=
per and
the chemical chain between grease and wax is all too different.  If tha=
t
doesn't work, buy 3M Perfect-It Foam Pad Glaze and rub out the car by c=
ar.
This is a fine abrasive that will not leave any swirls on the car when
finished.  Works way better than any product by Zymol or anyone else.  =
Everyone
should have a pint of this stuff on their shelf, works great for plasti=
c
scratches and any paint imperfection.

My vote is for Farzaan to post the mods on a page so that everyone can =
take a
look.  I love this list but for everyone who says a particular mod is g=
reat,
there is an equal but opposite opinion.  It gets confusing.
