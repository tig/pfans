Hello Dom,

To the best of my knowledge, there are two sources for the 12 point allens.
Snap On, and Lisle. I'm sure there are more, but I only know those two.

You can reach Snap On Direct at (800) 525-8497. Snap On calls the 12 point
tool a 'triple square'.

Lisle tools can be found in any good auto parts or tool place. If you
get the Lisle tools, you might as well get the entire set (6, 8, 10, 12)
which will be good for CV joints, flywheel bolts, and the pulleys. 
The set costs about $10. 

The Snap On tool is higher quality, but more money, like $18 each. It 
comes in a  3/8" socket. The Lisle tool is a bit that requires a 1/2" 
socket to use. 

Either one works. In my experience, I like the Lisle tool for removing
CV joints (the added length helps), but the Snap On tool is easier for
flywheels and pulleys. 

Good luck,
