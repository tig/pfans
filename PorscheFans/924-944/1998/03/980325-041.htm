Hey Rob:

Long time...No hear

As to R1 pressures, BFG recommends you run 1lb cold pressure for every
100lbs of vehicle weight and then add 2lbs to the end of the vehicle that
has the engine.  In our cars, I start with the stated curb weight of 3086.
So I run 30-31 psi in the rear and 32-33 psi in the front.  At these
pressures you will not ever experience the so called 'groove of doom.'  The
'groove of doom' some will tell you about is a physical manifestation of
insufficient internal pressure.  BFG will tell you when their tire is at its
optimum operating pressure the car will actually feel a touch squirrelly
relative to the way it feels at slightly below optimum pressure.  However
this is where you want to be for maximum grip and tire life.

You should check the tire pressures after runs to find out how much they are
'growing' in psi.  You want to keep the growth to a minimum.  As you attempt
to keep all other variables constant, try different cold pressures and see
how it affects your lap times.

You will find many folks will suggest running lower and substantially lower
psi.  I find it interesting these folks (and someone will rip me a new
you-know-what for this comment) are not typically the fastest.  I believe
the higher psi work better and the engineers at BFG know more about the
construction and optimal conditions for their tires than those that run a
few events a year.

Using this model/formula, I got 12 full track days and approx. 600 miles of
highway driving (to and from the track when I was too lazy to pull the
trailer.
