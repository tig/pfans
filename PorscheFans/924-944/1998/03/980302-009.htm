Bryce:  

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you but my e-mail has been down
since Friday morning.

Unfortunately, I'm not sure what the technical difference between the
K-27T6 and the K-27DR is except from the following description (as
quoted from the Powerhaus catalog):

1a. K-27-DR Turbocharger. We also offer a special "hot rod" version of
our 944 K-27 which has lower inertia times (spins up faster and
sooner) for drivers seeking extra acceleration. Also gives
approximately 7 more horsepower in the upper rpm's. 

Price: $1295.00 / Exchange 

I'll get back to you later today on a place to buy the XR-1 muffler. 
The 4" tip (either muffled or not) is available from a variety of
aftermarket places (pick up a copy of "European Car", "Turbo" or
"Sport Compact Car" and flip through).  I think I have a copy of one
of them at home and will grab it tonight to give you some further
ideas tomorrow.

In terms of the manifold and bypass pipe, I'm afraid that is out of my
league.  Hopefully, someone at PFans will be able to help you out.

Sorry,
