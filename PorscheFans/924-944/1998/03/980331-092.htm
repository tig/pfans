Hi,

Correct.  The S2 does not have the metal tray.

> I want to use the front spoiler undertray covering the bottom of the
> radiator, and the plastic undertray behind that, from a wrecked '89 =
951.

The only question I would have is: why?  The S2 already has the plastic =
pans
under the front and the engine.  I think you run the risk of screwing up =
the
airflow on your S2 if you install the metal tray.  The 951 is designed =
for
the rear metal tray, but the S2 is not.

I'm not saying you can't make it work, but I don't see any benefit =
either.
The exhaust systems on these engines exit in different locations.  The S2
exhaust comes down more towards the right side, whereas the 951 crosses =
over
to the turbo and then comes down more towards the left.  The metal tray =
is
cut to accommodate this.  This tray also makes changing the oil a pain in
the butt because it has to be removed to get at the drain plug.  Unless =
you
plan on cruising at 150 I'd say forget it.

>Can somebody with a 951 and an S2 compare the undersides and let me know
>if the two undertrays are identical and interchangeable -- TIA.

I can compare my car to my son's and let you know...
