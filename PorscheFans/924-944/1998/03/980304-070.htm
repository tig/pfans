Howdy,

In my future race car, I was debating about what brakes to use.  I'm trying
to arrange all the parts, etc. before I dive in.  I have decided on the
aluminum metal matrix rotors with their special pad material.  They don't
need much cooling to work well and they are a very light material.  I've also
got an engineer friend at one of the MMC who will supply parts for a great
discount.

But, he warned me that keeping the caliper cool to prevent fluid boiling
has been a problem since the MMC rotors can work at very high temperatures.
He just made a comment to work on something for that, so I emailed a friend
at Dynamic Suspension out in Europe, they used to build (maybe still do)
some of the BTCC touring cars including Ford's Mondeo a couple of years back.

Now, this is cool.  What he said to do is to copy the rally teams method,
but to go as extreme.  You can water cool the caliper, but it involves
too much work, so the other trick they use is to pump the brake fluid
through the system.  Demon Tweeks latest catalogue has such a pump (I
didn't even notice it until he mentioned it).  By pumping the brake fluid
through the system, it would act like coolant in a radiator.  By the time
the hot fluid moves around, it cools before it gets back to the caliper.

He mentioned that there may be some problems, but that he didn't forsee
them on a vehicle such as a Porsche.  This guy is highly knowledgeable,
so I don't doubt his experience, but I was wondering if anyone you know of
has tried this method before, and if so, how did it work out?

Farzaan.
