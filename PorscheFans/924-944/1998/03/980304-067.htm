Hey, HEY! Tough talk from someone who doesn't even own a Porsche.

I wonder what kind of brake vents your automatic BMW has?
They should be pretty large to stop that overweight tub. If you
don't have any, I could probably fabricate something. Then
again, those cars weren't designed for the kind of driving
that would require brake cooling ducts. 

I think you must be sore because even though your old, dearly departed
(sold) Porsche had the brake ducts, you still couldn't keep up with me
on the track. Or was all that spinning at Lime Rock from something
else?
