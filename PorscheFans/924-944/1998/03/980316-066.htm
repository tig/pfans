"My 89 951 has a drive line vibration around 3000rpm. All belts are
correctly installed and tensioned. The vibes can be felt in the shifter
and slightly in the clutch pedal when it is depressed. Everyone who has
driven the car thinks it is in the drive line and is not an engine
vibration. Also my climate control has started to cycle continuously
from hot to cold. When the air is heating up I can hear a "click" around
the glove box. Then the air will cool off. Afew seconds later the
heating begins. If the AC is on you can hear the air flow sound change
as if you were pressing the recirc button in and out. A local shop did
some trouble shooting with Porsche proceedures and they said it was the
interior temp sensor which is around $300 new. Any suggestions is
greatly appreciated 89 951 alpine white w/ cyntex chip 82K and great!!

I too have a similar vibration. Mine is in the clutch pedal and shifter
whether in gear or not, clutch in or out. Above 3000 rpm it disappears.
The vibration is a bit more noticeable under load. Belts checked, clutch
replaced, transmission partially rebuilt, and mounts replaced. It must
be forward of the clutch but what ??? As far as I can tell it must be
the flywheel. The vibration was reduced somewhat when the clutch was
last changed and the flywheel was machined. I don't know what to do
about this as serious investigation would require serious $$$$.
