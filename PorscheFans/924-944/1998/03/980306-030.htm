Dear Lenny:

I'm impressed knowing how quickley you have passed judgement on
this company while admitting you have "personally NEVER done 
business with them".  

I have found both David (sales) and John (tech) to be both concerned
and accommodating in my dealings with Tweeks.

There was a particular order I had placed that did not arrive on
schedule...having spoke w/ David they promptly shipped it overnight
AND gave me 20% discount for the misunderstanding.

I find it hard to believe that any company today operates under
a forum that is less than subservient when dealing with clients,
potential or otherwise.

By the way Lenny...you might want to check your dictionary...last
time I checked "irregardless" wasn't a word in the English language!?

My mother once told me...if you don't have anything nice to say about
someone...don't say anything...
