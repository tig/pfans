> What did all your improvements set you back?
I've done alot of experimenting (4 different turbos) and therefore
have spent more $ than I care to mention, just for the sake of
upgrading, let alone repairing.

If I take just the preferred engine improvements, here's the breakout:

K-27T6 turbo:  $1,200
Custom APE chips:  $600
Mass Air Flow sensor:  $1,650 (includes credit for trading in old APE
chips)
Lightened flywheel/kevlar clutch:  $1,200
3.0 bar fuel pressure regulator:  $90
Wide fire ring head gasket:  $100
Borla XR-1 Race Muffler:  $200
TOTAL:  $5,040 plus ALOT of labor

This does not include putting in the short gears from a 944S2 as I'm
looking to pick-up a 1989 tranny with LSD and transmission oil cooler
this week (I like the stock long gears better overall).

> Has the car been dyno'd?
Yes:  240hp at the rear wheels with the K-27T6 turbo, gutted cat, APE
chips and 16 pounds (1.1 bar) of boost.  The car is down on power as
compared to similar cars with the same upgrades because of its old,
tired motor.  

Since the dyno test, I added the K-26S turbo, MAF kit and Borla XR-1
muffler as well as a top-end rebuild.  I expect that the car would
make slightly more power, probably in the 260hp range.  I will be
dynoing it in the next couple of months and will post the results.

> If the cat is installed will it pass an Idle emissions test?  
Yes.

>I am thinking of moving up from my 83 944.  Thanks for any info.

Good luck and keep in mind when shopping for a 951 (as with any other
Porsche), buy the newest one you can afford with the least miles.  In
addition, always have the car given a thorough once-over by an
experienced mechanic.  I can't stress how important this is!!  Case in
point:  I got overly excited when I was looking to buy mine and was so
anxious that I skipped this step and bought the car on the spot.  I
paid the price (to the tune of $2,000) two months later when the
tranny failed.
