<< P-fans, I called my dealer to order the updated top strut brg. I gave the
 parts man the no. 951.343.018.013 or are the last digits .03 ? Any way he
 comes back with the part no. 951.343.018.04 Is this the right updated part
 no.? He gave me a price of $122.16 each. Is that what everyone bought it for?
 Just wanted to know before I ordered the strut brgs. >>

Colin,
Before you spend $250 on the updated stock rubber-mounted bearings, you should
consider steel spherical bearings, like:
-- Camberballs (not sure if they're sold direct anymore, but they're available
from OGRacing for, I think, $189/pair.   I had a set on my 85.5 and they made
a significant improvement in turn-in, cornering speed and stability.  Ride may
be a little more harsh, but not much.
--Ground Control adjustable camber plates and spherical bearings; $269/pair.
These enable more camber, more easily adjusted, and are available with a
pretty inexpensive coil-over option.

I have a low mileage 88 turbo S with the updated strut bearings, and while
they're stiffer than the earlier units, they're not nearly the same as the
solid spherical setup.  I plan to upgrade soon to one or the other of the
options above.
