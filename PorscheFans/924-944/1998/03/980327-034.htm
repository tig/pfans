Tom, I have particular interest in your story about your first experience at
Seattle International Raceway on 3/21/98.  That day was also the first time
my wife & I participated in an event at SIR (we had the baby...).

My wife & I had particular interest in how the event was operated that day,
since we've both driven tracks before with numerous regions in the New
England area, me for 14 years, plus some autocross.  I architected the
Northeast Region's current track program about 6 years ago and made it into
a hugely successful series, measured both from the club's point of view
(safety, attendance, financial, logistics & operations) and the entrant's
(safety, well-run & organized, good instruction, good amount of track time).
My wife frequently ran the "Control" position, managing the radio
communications, pit/paddock communications, run sessions, etc.

I concur with many of your points about the event's organization &
operation.  My wife was in the beginner class and related much of what
happened there and how it was done.  Briefly, I noted the following
characteristics about the event:
- It was disorganized
- It was poorly planned
- It was inefficient (reduced track time for everyone)
- It was dangerous during the novice sessions (swapping instructors *on the
main straight* with cars running)
- It uses non-standard classifications for driver experience
- Entrant communications (announcements) was virtually non-existent
- Too many arbitrary rules & conditions that added no value
- Some flaggers didn't pay attention and were inadequately trained

I was stunned to hear at the Novice talk that students beyond the 30th (that
day) were told they could not participate, as there weren't enough
instructors to service them.  Well, limiting student signups & matching them
to instructors is the point of the registration process, and it's an easy
problem to fix.  Many people wasted their time getting up early and driving
from all over the Seattle area to SIR, only to be sent away.

I also spoke with the event Registrar about some of the logistics.  She told
me she did not know who payed & who didn't, who attended the mandatory
school the preceding Thursday night, etc. etc.  This doesn't matter to the
participant directly but affects overall operation from the volunteer's
side.

The most berserk thing in my mind, is the passing protocol which requires
the leading car to pull off-line (right) while signaling to the left for the
following car to pass on that side.  This goes against common sense and
world-wide use of the turn indicator.  This is also a very dangerous thing
since it violates standards, practices, and motor vehicle law.  It creates
dangerous scenarios during passing, such as how the passed car should signal
when pulling back on-line, into the path of other following cars.  I
understand that people were confused at the beginner instruction session
about the protocol.

Now, the best thing I can do after laying out these problems, is to suggest
fixes and help implement them.  That's what I will do this year.  The
organizers are all volunteers and are doing their best to make these events
happen.  If PNWR is like most regions, they are understaffed, overworked,
and frequently criticized.  Any & all help they can get will improve their
event and add value for the participants.  It's easy to do and nobody can
get fired, so I plan on getting active straight away.

BTW, I saw your note about trying PIR with Oregon Region.  I've never run
with them, but their web site schedule shows the first car starting at
1:00pm and running until dusk.  I don't know why they start so late, unless
it's to let you & me drive the 3 hours down there in the morning!  See

You're not raining on my parade... more likely Pacific NW Region PCA.After
going through this DE I have to agree it left a lot to be desired.The whole
day should have been dedicated to the 1st time drivers, notintermixed with
all the other run groups. That would allowed plenty oftime for one-on-one
instruction. However, I'm sure that would have alsoraised the price
considerably. In my particular case I felt safe enoughdue to my years of
driving experience, however I know that others =probablydidn't feel too good
about the situation. Just following along behindanother car could easily
have been intimidating for some people.
