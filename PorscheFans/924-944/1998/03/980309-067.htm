P-Fans,

Maybe you just missed it like I did while I was gone. Or maybe you just
chose to ignore it. But get those flame suits out because I'm absolutely
SHOCKED at the lack of response good ole' boy JohnG received from the
collective after posting the following....

Fortunately, someone noticed....

And the only response Ole got was a well-stated post from Roxanne and
comments from Matt Harrison.

Well, this is a CALL TO ARMS P-Fans, our should I say keyboards. Look at
Ole's last sentance for the impression JohnG has left about us Americans,
and how our lack of response has simply reinforced that perception. Why are
we so willing to quickly respond to such innocent suggestions as changing
oil every 2500 miles, yet we ignore idiots like JohnG.

JohnG deserves to be drummed out of the corp, verbal assulted from every
member and have his Porsche keys taken away from him for life! I would have
hoped that by virtue of being smart enough to buy one of the finest cars
made that WE were above such stupid actions... and isn't it insulting for
JohnG to think that bragging about it was going to be accepted by the rest
of us.

JohnG, you are a total jerk and I hope everyone on this list lets you know
you are not welcome among normal, civilized people. It is wrong to drink and
drive. But it is beyond stupidity to drink and then street race with three
other cars to the next watering hole.... and to the next.... and to the
next.

Although I don't have any reason to expect my comments will have any effect
on his behavior, there is always the chance the impossible will occur.
Perhaps if we are all loud enough, JohnG will actually realize how insanely
he has been driving. Don't get me wrong, I'm not exactly Mr. Law and Order.
I'll be the first to admit I rarely drive the speed limit and that I've also
engaged in many a street race. But drinking and group street racing WILL
eventually kill someone... and typically it is the innocent who suffer most.
