Hello Folks,

I need some advice. I just had my 90 S2 (62k mi) checked out as part of a 
local PCA/Dealer offer.  The mechanic reported that there is a noisy 
belt roller or tensioner.  He also noticed oil sepage from the top
balance shaft seal area.  

My mechanic -- not the dealer -- replaced the timing and balance belts, and 
the rollers at 45k mi. A bit later, I noticed the oil sepage [which 
probably pre-dates the belt change], and pulled the belt cover to get a 
look. There was no oil on the belts, so I was satisfied there wasn't a real 
problem. A third mechanic reported the roller noise during 60k mi service 
at which he re-tensioned the belts. This guy didn't mention the oil sepage, 
so I figure he didn't think it was a problem at the time -- and since he'd 
done the belt retensioning, he would have seen if the balance shaft was 
leaking into the belt housing etc. He also didn't suggest I do anything 
about the roller noise right away. (All these guys are seasoned Porsche 
shops.) 

My feeling is that I'll pull the belt cover, and if the belts etc are
clean, and the situation doesn't get worse, I'll let the thing go until
the next belt re-tension at 75k.  I was planning on changing the belts
again at 90k, and doing the water pump at that time as well.

Another data point -- I use sythetic or sythetic blends, 10w-30 or 20w-50
depending on the time of year.  

Car sees auto-x and driver's ed use.


QUESTIONS:

1)  Is the noisy roller likely to indicate an impending disaster?  Should
I get the thing attended to pronto?

2)  Ditto the balance shaft seal.  This is NOT heavy sepage, and there's
no measureable oil usage between changes (2-3 k mi).

3)  When I have the belts/rollers/seals done again, I'll have the water 
pump checked and possibly replaced.  Anything else to do in there at this
service?

Thanks
