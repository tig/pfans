Hi folks,

I'm new to this list and new to Porsches in general.  In the past I've 
owned only Hondas and BMW's....

My current 88 prelude, my daily driver, died and I'm thinking of replacing 
it with a 944.
I am thinking about getting an 951, (88 944 TurboS or 89 944 Turbo).  I've 
tried to learn all I can about the 951 via Internet and the Faq.  Before I 
jump into a purchase, I thought it may be a good idea to tap into the 
collective wisdom of this list!

This car will be my daily driver.  I am not worried about snow since I also 
have an accord for the snow, which is not too much of a problem in the 
Washington D.C.  Metro area.

I have a few questions and I'll appreciate any input you all have to offer.


1)  What is the best year/model/options combo for the 944s?

2)  How is reliability?
        a.  How many miles can I expect from the engine?
        b.  Electrical Problems?
        c.  Squeaks inside the car?
        d.  Fluid leaks?
        e.  clutch? Transmission?
        f.  suspension components?
        g. rust?


3) What can I expect in terms of maintenance costs?


4) What kind of things I should look for when purchasing a 944?


5) How many miles can I expect from the engine?


6) What are some tell tale indicators that the car has been in an accident?




Thanks

Kai Wang
