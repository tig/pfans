Hello Again Everyone,

I have received some positive response from my posting yesterday regarding
944 timing belts and the infamous tensioning tool. I want to clarify one
point though. I mentioned EBS and their belt tensioning tool program as a
poor option. After receiving a polite and professional response from them, I
felt the need to clarify my position. EBS was no more expensive than getting
the work done at my local Porsche dealer. I opted to have the job done by
Sunset Porsche and save some of my own precious time. EBS did mention that
most of their tool rentals go to people in remote areas that don't have a
qualified service shop near and to others that will not let anyone touch
their beloved vehicles. I have been in both of those situations at on time
or another and can appreciate the option of being able to rent the
tensioning toll Vs. outright purchase. Furthermore, I have purchased parts
through EBS and will again in the future. They were prompt, competitive and
very helpful.


Thanks,

M.R.
