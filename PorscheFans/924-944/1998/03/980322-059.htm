Check your fans to ensure they are running properly.  If they are not
coming on as they should, check the temp sending unit thing that screws
into the back of the radiator.  If that goes bad, your fans won't come
on when the heat rises.  The Haynes manual has a good procedure for
checking whether this part works by puting it in a pot of boiling water
and using a volt/olm meter to see when the contacts open/close.  Be
careful pulling and replacing it since the radiator is plastic and
easily strips out.  (I stripped mine out and ended up having to use JB
Weld to fix it. Amazingly, it does not leak!) If it is bad, get a new,
low temp version of the part from Automation.

If the temperature sending unit is OK, you probably have a bad
thermostat.  Replacing it is a bear.  You have to take out the radiator
and use some very strong circlip retracting pliers to pull the circlip
ring out of the water pump that holds the themostat in.  I broke a pair,
and ended up filing down some needle nosed pliers to get the circlip out
of the water pump.  

Best of luck!
