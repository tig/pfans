Hi Fans,

Well Spring is here almost in the Northeast and I thought I would post
my car that I have for sale.  It's a 1987 944S Guards Red w/ black
partial leather interior.  It has 120,000 miles on it and I bought it
with 115,000.  I recently found a 90 S2 Cabriolet so that is why I am
selling my "S".  I didn'y receive any paper work with the 87 so this is
why I spent so much prevenative dollars on the car.  My intention was to
keep it.  Well here goes and please don't laugh :-)  4 new tires, motor
mounts, steering rack both fuel regulators, K&N filter, a/c condenser,
fan sensor, plugs, all belts and rollers, all fluids, repacked cv
joints, painted left side of car. everything works! no cuts or cracks
anywhere. there is a picture of the car at Roxanne's web site.  Price is
$8,300.00 firm that is break even for me.  Sorry about the bandwidth.

For more info email me at rpcas@ntcnet.com    TIA

Rick Casadonte
