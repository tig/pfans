Interesting stuff on the radar detector situation in the U.K. Horray for you
guys!!

FYI on the U.S. situation... I am no "legal eagle" but to my understanding,
detectors are legal in 48 of 50 states. The exceptions being Virginia and one
other (Wash D.C?..not sure).  Up till a few years ago, many states had laws
against these...however, the laws were turned over in a similar fashion to
your case. The reasoning behind it was due to the fact that our federal law
dictates that citizens typically cannot be under surveillance, without
probable cause,  without their consent. Sounds somewhat strange (what's the
point of surveillance if you know that it is going on..), but it allowed
citizens to use a device that could inform them of ongoing surveillance.

In California...they have gone to even greater measures.  No radar can be used
throughout the state. Californians passed a law stating that it is a total
violation of their rights.  Police officers must time your speed between two
points, pace behind you, or reverse clock (pass at a higher speed and see if
anyone follows).  Amazingly, I did not find the highways speeds to be that
much different than the those in the eastern states.

Cheers...
