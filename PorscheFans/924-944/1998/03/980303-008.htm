  The local rice burner builder in Memphis is the one that convinced me to go
with the GReddy, although they like the HKS also.  They said there was no
reason to go with an aftermarket wastegate unless I'm getting boost
creep(sounds like a disease).  The biggest problem is finding where to mount
the unit inside car.  I'm thinking about removing equalizer and putting unit
there.  Thanks for the input Jim.
