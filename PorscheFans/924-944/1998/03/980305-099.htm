Hi Adrien,
Automotion uses the term "offset" to mean (and I quote from the Automotion
catalog) 
"Wheel offset is a term used to describe the difference between the plane
of the mounting surface of the wheel and its inner and outer rims" To me
this is the "backspace"  Hence their numbers are quite large - 95mm to 170mm
 
The Porsche tech manuals however, use the term "offset" to mean, the
distance between the plane  of the mounting surface and the centreline of
the wheel as described by the two rim faces. This number is typically
smaller - 10.6mm to 65mm

You can easily convert either measurement to the other - as an example your
6JX15 is 6" or 150mm wide.  The centreline is at 150/2 = 75mm.  if the
offset in Pcar parlance is 10.6mm, than the distance from the mounting
surface to the inner rim is 75+10.6 = 85.6mm.(backspace)

Yes! the 6JX15(944-362-102-00)52.3mm Phonedial is standard fitment but
since the 7JX15(944-362-104-00)is also a 52.3mm offset it should fit.

As for rubbing - if the wheel is too far inboard, it will rub the
suspension/brake components and if it too far outboard, it will rub the
fender, besides looking ridiculous.  A wider tire will exarcebate the
rubbing, since a wider tire will extend (equally) further out from the rim
faces. I know this is commonsense, but once you know your specific wheel
and car's offset you can determine mathematically what condition you will
encounter with the car/wheel/tire combination.

Hope this helps.
