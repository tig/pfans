Assuming you are changing the fluid in a MANUAL TRANSMISSION, the differential
fluid and the tranny fluid are the same ( SAE 80W API Classification GL 4 gear
lubricant)  and will both be changed with one proceedure.  You have correctly
found the drain plug and the refill plug,and yes they are 17mm allens. Your
"old bolt trick" may work if the plugs are not too tight.   To change the
fluid make sure the car has been run to bring the transmission fluid
temperature up to operating temperatures.  The old fluid will drain faster and
will take more deposits out with it if the fluid is hot.  Remove the drain
plug and let the old fluid drain completely.  Re-install the drain plug and
remove the filler plug.  It is extremely easy to refill the transmission if
you will purchase a small hand pump from Pep Boys ( about $6-$8 ).  It is
nothing more than a little suction pump similar to those you see on hand
lotion bottles and soap despensers.  The pump has threads on it that will
screw down on the plastic gear lube bottles and also on plastic oil bottles.
I highly recommend it.  It really comes in handy when you have no drain plug
to remove the old fluid (ex. Ford Explorer,  Lincoln Town Car,etc.) and must
suction the old fluid out.  Also can be used to suction old brake fluid from
the fluid resevoir on a brake job ( now you can return the turkey baster to
the kitchen).  Now, refill the transmission until the level in the tranny is
even with the bottom of the filler hole.  You're done!  Clean up your mess and
go out and play with your toy.
Hope this helps you out some.

>I want to change to the Trans and Differential fluid on my ´83 944, 
could someone tell me where the drain plug is, and the fill plug (of 
course). I have it understood that the Trans and Differential on the 944 
share the same oil, but when I looked in a Shell Oil reference book the 
both appeared separately. Could someone please clear me up on this and 
tell me where the plugs are, I have already located two, very large 
plugs (allen, about 17mm), on the drivers side, but I am not sure. Also, 
if those are the plugs could I just use an old bolt with two nuts to 
lock? Thanks. >
