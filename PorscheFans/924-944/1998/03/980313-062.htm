Dude! You've found them already. Just use your 17mm allen
key/wrench/socket and undo the upper one. Then loosen the lower one,
keeping a catch pan handy, and then let 'er rip! I chocked my wheels
before going underneath and jacking it up. Also, it helps to let gravity
give you assistance in this matter by jacking on the right side just
forward of the rear right wheel. (No flames -- I know everyone has an
opinion on where's the "correct" place to jack up a 944.) Once all the
old fluid is drained, cap it back and tighten. Then you may need to
lower the jack and relocate it aft, if possible and jack there. If not,
try to find a level place where there's a ditch in the ground for you to
slide in underneath the car. This is so that the car will be level when
filling in the new fluid. I haven't heard any horror stories of having
too much fluid in your transaxle yet but I'm sure there's one out there.
You might want to slightly bend the muffler shield a bit upwards to
allow space to insert your bottle to fill into the fill hole. I used
about three (03) bottles.....actually it's 2.8 quarts but I let the rest
dribble out to ensure that it's full. Then cap it back up and tighten. I
hope this helps.
