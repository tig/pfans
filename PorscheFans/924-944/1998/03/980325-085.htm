<<I know that the tire pressures that people use in R1's can vary quite a
bit, but I would like to see if we can get a general list consensus on a
good range of pressures for 944 series cars.  I just got my first set of
R1's and I've heard a couple of opinions, so the advice will help :)>>

I second Rob's request.  On my 911, I ran very low pressures (22/24 F/R) at
the suggestion of a "tire expert" who also happened to be a tire salesman.
Needless to sat, they developed the groove of doom in short order.  On my S2.
I have had one track day on a new set (245/45/16 all around), but it was in
the wet.  I started out at 32/32, but reduced it to 30/30.  They behaved OK,
though the wet conditions made the car plow a lot on slow turns.  On the
street, 32/32 seems to  make the front end feels a bit floaty.  Any advice
from experts on the list would be appreciated.
