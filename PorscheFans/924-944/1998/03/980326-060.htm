<< He offered to use my car as a test bed and complete the system,
 but I'm not sure there would be any interest in it...since a 951 can be
 had for about $2000 plus my car (better brakes, yada yada yada...shut up
 951 guys).  So there it is...if anyone thinks such a system would be
 worthwhile....let me know.  One benefit would be insurance cost.   >>

All,
I think there is a potential market here.  924S turbo anyone?  How about for
those folks who are tired of the damn exhaust manifold problems in the 951?
How about someone needing new manifolds, crossover pipe, and turbocharger?????
And, as you said, the 951 has knock sensor so you could be more agressive w/
the boost.

Just a thought.
