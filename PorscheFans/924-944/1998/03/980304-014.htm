Jeff,

I too had this problem, however, it started before I bought the car and   
my floormat was more like soaked by the time I figured it out.  Sounds   
like you have a bad clutch master cylinder.  Look up at where your clutch   
pedal attaches to the master which goes through the firewall.  Check for   
leaks.  It should be fairly obvious.  The fluid on the floormat leads me   
to think this.  But, the fluid on the floor of the garage might be the   
brake master...?

Also check the level of brake fluid because as you probably know, they   
share the same reservoir, and you could be close to the min level.  I   
bought a new clutch master at my favorite parts store for 89, but I could   
have bought it from the dealer for 85 (with 15% PCA membership discount)   
and you can get one from Vertex (see Excellence) for like 50 bucks.

Also, if it is the clutch master, consider replacing the slave as per   
yesterday's digest comments.
