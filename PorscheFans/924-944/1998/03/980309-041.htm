Sunday 8th March 1998

Location: Guildford, Surrey, England
Time: 9:45
Reason for travel: Get some munchies from local 'gas' station....note
fluent translation :-)
Incendent:

At traffic lights notice 'old bill' behind me and proceed at speed limit
to 'gas' station (about 100 meters). Park and attempt to exit vehicle.
At this point Mr Plod (who has now parked next to be AND blocked my
exit) opens his window and asks THAT question:

Plod 'Is this YOUR vehicle sir'
Me 'No I've just stolen it !' (Said in an amusing a friendly way, after
all Mr Plod has a sense of humor, doesn't he ?)

At  this point I find out that he has had a sense of humor by-pass
(along with a labotomy) possibly part of the training for those 'beat
bobbies' aged 40+ (i.e Mr Fuzz the failure!).

He exits the plodmobile and starts to shout loudly (kinda like the drill
instructor in Full Metal Jacket..you get the picture).

He now proceeds to find fault with my vehicle and unknow to me one of my
tail lights has blown (oops !). For this he decides that i am
'scum'....'I don't like your sort' and while shouting and belowing (to
the disbelife of other motorists) attempt to extract my details. I
relate my name address etc...to which he replies ' You expect me to
belive that do you ?', odd that it was, I did expect him to belive me ! 

To cut a long story short I have a LOT of hassle from Mr Plod in my
area, I'm 25 not 17 and i'm not tearing about in a lad moible with tints
and a baked bean can as an exhast !

Why should I have to put up with this s**t (i've no been pulled about 6
or 7 times, I'm thinking of getting my own parking bay at Guildford Plod
Shop).

Can someone with a bit of UK legal expertise tell what they can and
CAN'T do, they work FOR ME, I pay their wages (I know they've got a chip
the size of Texas (i think its quite big ?) on thier shoulder) but Its
not on.

So some one PLEASE help. Apologies for length of this and I know its not
all techie and stuff but at least you can laugh at my
misfortune.......UNTIL IT HAPPENS TO  YOU !

Thanks,

Tim.

88 944S (one bust tail light, one 7 day wonder, one wicked car, one less
person with any 	       		respect for 'smokey' hey this lingo easy !)
