The HKS in my car is mounted on the driver's side window pillar just
above
the dash. Although it does seem to "stare you in the face", it is not
obtrusive.

Jim,
I believe you misunderstood my problem.  I have a GReddy boost gauge
already mounted to the A-Pillar on the left top of my dash.  I agree
with you, this is the best place for it, very easy to see(I watch it
quite a bit under hard acceleration).

What I am talking about is a boost control unit made by GReddy called
the ProFec.  I haven't seen the actual unit but I have seen pictures.
The front is fairly small, maybe like the face of the original passport
radar detector.  I checked at the radio shop today about moving my
equalizer under the radio, but they said it had a factory din cable
connecting to the head unit which they do not know where to get a longer
cable like this and that there is probably not one available.  I believe
I could fit both the fuel mixture gauge and the boost control where the
equalizer is but it looks like I'll have to find another option.
