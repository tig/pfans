Hi, folks.  I wonder if anyone can help me figure out what I've done.  While
putting a roll bar in my 924S, I was kneeling in the rear cargo area over the
gas tank.  I've removed the rear seat and I had the carpet and soundproofing
out from that area as well well.  Well, I was putting quite a bit of pressure,
apparently, with one knee in a small area.  The sheet metal flexed and I heard
a crunch or similar noise from below one of my knees.  

Since then, I've had a pronounced rattle from that area, seemingly from over
the gas tank.  It's a tinny kind of sound that occurs on rough pavement and
over bumps.  The stiff suspension (sport Koni's, etc.) doesn't help.  Can
anyone tell me what is in that area over the tank, and what I might have done?
Not looking forward to pulling the gas tank to find out.  Thanks for any
shared wisom.
