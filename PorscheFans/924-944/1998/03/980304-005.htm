Hi P-Fans,

I also got my part for a good price from Mr.Sv056...he told me his name was
"Richard" BTW, not "Kamil."  Although I did FINALLY get my part, I got the
same EXACT excuse for the month-long purchase: 1)sold part of the order you
wanted, still want it?  2)lost your address.  

After MANY unfriendly questions, he finally sent my part.  I guess he may
thought it wasn't worth it to take my $30 and be warned against on the
944p-fan list, he still want to sell the rest of his '86 944.  

My conclusion is:  He has cheap parts, but have him send it first, or at
least UPS C.O.D. it.  Otherwise, forget it!  Sure, you may get your part as
Mr.PhoneDial-Rims or Mr.Sunroof did, and may eventually get the right part,
as Mr.Hall will find out, but it's a pain it the ass!  This is what
happened to me.  Others got less hassel, lucky them.
