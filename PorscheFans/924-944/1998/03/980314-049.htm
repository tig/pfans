Gary,

I own a'95 968.  If my information is correct, there were only 365 of
these
made worldwide in 1995.  I don't know if you consider that rare or not?
They are a little harder to find some performance parts for than a 944
or
993.  For example, nobody makes a front strut brace that fits under the
hood and clears the engine.  There is no short throw shifter available.
Bilstein does not make front struts that fit.  Koni discontinued their
front struts.

The car is as near perfectly balanced as you can get.  Mine was recently

corner balanced and with small adjustments to the rear, we achieved a
near
perfect 25% on each corner with driver and gas.  It has 236 horsepower
stock.  With a few bolt-on modifications that is easily raised to about
260
or 270, give or take.  This is in a normally aspirated car with more
torque
at a lower RPM than the turbos.  My car goes from 0-60 MPH in about 5.7
to
6.0 seconds.  This was clocked by me with a stopwatch and with a G-Tech
Pro
meter.  The brakes are excellent and according to my G-Tech Pro, it
stops
from 60 to 0 in about 117 feet.  These numbers are similar to a new BMW
M3
and an '88 or '89 944 Turbo S.  This is for your comparison only.

My car has the limited slip differential but does not have the sport
suspension known as M030.  The M030 suspension adds adjustable height
spring perches at all four corners, with much stiffer coil-over shocks
and
springs.  It also adds thicker anti-sway bars and larger "928S4-sized"
brakes.  I chose to upgrade the suspension of my car on my own with
Weltmeister anti-sway bars, adjustable Koni sport shocks and struts, H&R

springs, and adjustable spherical bearing camber plates.  I also
upgraded
to Pagid Orange compound brake pads and slotted rotors.  The result is
it
stills rides fantastic on the street and it does extremely well at the
autocross.  At last month's autocross here in San Diego, I took third
best
time of the day overall and another 968 (more stock than mine but with a

faster driver) took second overall.  I'm not bragging, just letting you
know how well balanced and quick these cars are.

A '95 993 is an excellent car.  The suspension is much more forgiving
then
the 964's and earlier models.  They are not as "tail-happy" as the older

911's.  Some people love this and others do not.  They are about $50,000

used vs. $30,000.  They have around 272 horsepower and also do very well
at
autocross events.

The $28,000 asking price is definitely in line.  Especially if it is
clean.  I saw an ad in the local AutoTrader today for a '93 968 with
31,000
miles and they are asking $21,000.  If this car is clean, that is a
steal.
Typically I have seen them go for $26,000 to $32,000 for a clean coupe
with
less than 30,000 miles.

I recently sold a 928S4 to buy the 968.  I loved my 928, but do not miss
it
at all.  The 968 is much more enjoyable to me.

If you have any questions let me know.  I will be glad to help.
