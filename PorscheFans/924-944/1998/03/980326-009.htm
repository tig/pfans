OH MY GOD, I CAN'T STAND IT ANY MORE!!!!!!  I'VE GOT TO JUMP INTO THE PILE!!!!!

All this discussion probably belongs on the tavern list, but since it seems it
will stay on this one until some semblance of reality sets in, I'll try to 
inject some reality.

The great majority of folks in this world would say we are all wasting money
by buying and driving Porsche cars in the first place.  Let that thought soak 
in for a minute.  Now, try to use reason to deny it.  It's a matter or 
personal choice, no?

If this discussion were among only those who can afford to have other people
work on their Porsches, then I'm pretty sure the consensus would be that the
$400 tool is a good thing to use.  Many of the folks on this list are here 
because they want to know how to preserve their Porsche without having to pay 
$80 an hour to do so.  They also don't want to buy a $400 tool unless it is 
really necessary.  The obvious answer is, IT IS NOT NECESSARY!  It may be 
advisable, but not necessary.  Every day is a gamble.  Those school kids in 
Arkansas learned that the hard way a couple of days ago.

I think we are all keeping this issue going because way back in our minds we
have this image of Porsche AG being like the De Beers diamond company who have
kept up the image that diamonds are rare and expensive.  (You all do know about
the warehouses full of diamonds that De Beers has bought to keep the supply
down, don't you?)  The difference here is, our cars are freely bought and sold
on the open market and market forces are responsible for their value.  Expensive
maintenance is what has brought the market value of some of our cars down to 
10% of their sticker price, even while they still look and perform almost like 
new.  Thus, some of us distrust the idea of a $400 tensioning tool simply on 
principle.  A similar tool could be constructed with about $40 in parts, but 
you would have to CONSTRUCT it.  A professional mechanic is not going to waste 
his time constructing one and is going to tell you they are worth the money 
because they can use this tool hundreds of times.  A hobby mechanic is going 
to question its $400 price for only a few uses.

Unless we get a post from someone who was present at the Porsche engineers 
meeting where this tool was dreamed up, we are never going to get an answer
to the question "What is the probability that a 944 or 951 that is serviced 
using the time-honored 1/2 twist rule going to explode?"  I'm just glad the
guys in lab coats didn't mention this tool for the 931.

Now, if that didn't sound like a TAVERN discussion, I don't know what does.
