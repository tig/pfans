Hi,

I just took a quick look at Randall's results for the dyno.  Some impressive
numbers.  If you do a dyno run, try and do it in 4th gear.  From the 
results I've seen, the 4th gear runs give a more "normal" reading.  The
3rd gear pulls have no bottom end power and don't let the car run at wide
open long enough to discover any problems.

By looking at the runs in 3rd, I would say there are no problems, but looking
at the run in 4th shows an unusual immediate decline in HP at 5500rpm, kind
of like a pyramid drop.  It should be a smooth arc, rather than a sudden
drop.  A sudden drop like that could be a number of things:
1. not enough fuel to maintain correct A/F ratio
2. timing is backing down because of detonation
3. incorrect chip programming
4. flow of motor is maxed

I don't have any experience on the fueling system on this car, so I'll leave
the diagnostics to the experts, I believe we have some chip burners on
our list and wynnclaims@aol.com probably has more dyno runs on his 944T
than all of us combined.

If you were running out of turbo capacity, the arc would still be smooth,
not just a sudden drop.  If you look at my dyno results, you can see the
turbo pooping out at the top end, whereas your car looks like it should be
able to pull cleanly to the top.

Sorry Randall, still more tuning needed, there's another 10-15hp out there
for the taking :)  Another thing I'm concerned about is why it takes so
much boost to make good power in your car.  If I remember right, the boost
being run to get the good numbers was 1.25bar.  That's getting into my Talon
boost territory of 1.45bar and trust me, things don't survive long on the
track at 1.45bar of boost pressure :)
