  Mark,
  You got most of it right, but there are a couple of other small things
which I will show on your list.  I have had a couple of others ask so this
should answer everyone.

This has changed to the MFS chips.  I tried the K-27 chips with the MFS and
the car started but would go dead if you tried to give it gas.  I ran the
K-26 Stage II chips with the K-27 at first(before MFS) and when I switched
to the K-27 chips it seemed like the car ran better with the K-26 chips.
Point is there was a big difference in mapping of MFS chips.

> Bosch Rising rate fuel pressure regulator

  I only have a 3.0 bar fuel pressure  regulator.  David Reins says no more
is needed unless you go to the 2.8 or 3.0 liter.

  Extrude hone work on head and manifold with 8.3:1 Compression ratio

   I have been running up to 1.5 bar boost.  Too much fun to move it down.
It will be easier with the controller installed.

  Boost controller here, to be installed next week.  Bursh Cat Bypass,
drilled cycling valve.
 Tomorrow I get the larger throttle body and the modified intercooler
pipe(no 90 degree bend) from PH.
  Almost forgot, the PH clutch & flywheel 8# lighter and 4 times clamping
power as stock.

  My 993 C4 is for sale, its a great car but not as much fun.  I want a BMW
540i for a family car.  Right now I just have a Suburban and the 2
Porsches.

  Also, there was an earlier discussion about where the power gain from the
MFS was most pronounced: low end or high end.  David Reins told me low end,
Autothority told me high end(You would think they would know, they made
it).  David Reins is right as far as I can tell.  Pronounced difference on
low end, can't tell if there is a difference up high, but the Dyno will
give the real answer.
