Hi there,

I recently purchased a 1992 968 Coupe. Nice car but compared to my old 951S
"Silver Rose" it seems slow. I could not believe the loss of 10 BHP would be
so noticeable.

Please supply me details of the uprated Chip(s) you sell?

Please supply me details of anything else to sell to uprate a 968.

NOTE: The car is under a PORSCHE international warranty.
Can I replace the chip(s) with the original(s) should the car have to go in
the shop without the dealer picking it up on the computer? I can gain access
to a BOSCH "hammer" if this could be used to hide the chip.

Stephen,
Currently the Performance Chip is the only upgrade that we carry for the
968.  Gains were on the lines of 8% to 10% across the board, with a 15
horsepower gain at the peak.  Product literature regarding it is currently
available via mail or fax.  Forward us either and we will be happy to send
it to you.  As for your warranty, you can certainly swap the chips as much
as your heart desires.  However, you should not ever have a need to do so.
Firstly, it can not legally void your warranty, at least not under U.S.
consumer warranty law.  Secondly, unless someone decided to open your
computer for some strange reason, they would never know that it was there.
To all known diagnostic equipment, including the Bosch Hammer, it looks
identical to the factory software.  Idle specifications are the same, as
well as any related codes.
