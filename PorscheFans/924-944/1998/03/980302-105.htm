Hi all,

My Voltmeter gauge dropped to 0 today when I was about 100km away from
home.  Everything else seemed normal, fan belt was good,  oil pressure was
good, temperature was at the first white mark, so I decided to try to make
it home.  I just barely made it home with no lights, no radio etc.  By this
time the battery was so low, it couldn't even raise the lights,

Tonight I tried the car with the battery off my wife's car  and it started
but the voltmeter shows less that 12.

Any ideas on why the alternator would die so suddenly.  Anyone want to
fathom any guesses on what could be wrong here.

Grateful for any help.
TIA

David, 86' 944, 80k km.
