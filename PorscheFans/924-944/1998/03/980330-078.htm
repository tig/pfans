Hello P-Fans
=09
I=92ve been thinking a lot about Ferdinand and Ferry recently... I re-rea=
d an=0Ainterview with Ferry in the April =9198 issue of =93Classic and Sp=
orts Car=94 a=0ABritish Car magazine, the interview was given on Ferry=92=
s 75th birthday. This=0Ayear he would have been 89 yrs old. 

I found something special in what Ferry said in the article and took it t=
o=0Aheart.  I thought I would share it with you - P-Fans. 

I will quote the magazine here: =93To this day, Ferry Porsche resists the=
=0Asuggestion that the modern Porsche company began in 1948 (50 yrs old t=
his year=0Asound familiar?) with the manufacture of the first 356, and th=
e negotiation a=0Ayear latter of a deal under which VW would supply parts=
 - even though,=0Astrictly speaking, it did, Ferry said: =93My father beg=
an our company in 1931,=94=0Ahe insisted in our interview, referring to t=
he formation of a design=0Aconsultancy rather laboriously named Dr. Ingho=
f Porsche KG in that year. The=0Acompany built a 2-liter Wanderer touring=
 car and was later retained to design=0AAuto Union rear-engine racers for=
 the 750 kg grand prix formula.=94

So in this official year of celebrating Porsche's  50th birthday, I will=
=0Aalways think of it as Porsche=92s 68th!!!  Happy 68th Porsche and Ferr=
y, R.I.P.
