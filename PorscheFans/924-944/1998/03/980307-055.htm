If you are looking at 'modding' your car, than what is the use of consulting
what Porsche says???  Of course they will be against the majority of mods that
are out there, because (as with most companies) they do not endorse any
modifications.  They believe that the car is best left in stock form, as with
many others.

If you are thinking of doing mods to your Porsche, going to Porsche for
support is definately the WRONG way to get the 'real world' impact of those
modifications.  Look at tall the 951's that have been modded to some crazy HP
numbers!!!   I truly doubt Porsche would endose such modifications.

I myself came across a similar descision between 17's and 18's.  I probably
would have bought 18's if they still produced the replicas, but I ended up
purchasing the 17's.  Yes, 18's would have definately looked trick, but 17's
make my car look like a 'stock' 98 model to the un-trained eye.  18's would
have jumped out and said 'I'm aftermarket".  I prefer the stock "what the hell
kind of Porsche was that" look   ;)
