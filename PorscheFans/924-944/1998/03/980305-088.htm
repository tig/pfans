I am not a thermodynamacist, but I'd guess that water cooling the intercoooler
would provide only modest benefits versus the cost/complexity.  Of course,
those of us who are after every last bhp can gain some nominal benefit by
cleaning our intercoolers yearly (inside = oil, outside = dirt/debris).

I have bought the fiberglass nose panel from AIR that has a massive opening
for intercooler breathing.  I am not thrilled with the fit (next time I'd buy
from Hank at GT Racing instead), but the thing seems to provide some extra
oomph.  I think that minimally it may help deter detonation (my car runs at
1.1 - 1.2 bar of boost with Milledge chips).  I may try strapping some of
those cooler ice pack deals to my intercooler on some hot day this year to see
what happens...then again, maybe if we get rid of some weight...
