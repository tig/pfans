  i would like everyone that sent info. ref. my 944 when it would not 
start.  colorado springs is cold and with working i didn't have much 
time to work on the car.  if you remember, i had fuel pressure but no 
spark.  first i replaced the coil- then the speed/ref. mark sender (the 
rear one).  still no spark.  yesterday while on a day off i relooked at 
all the info. sent and someone talked about an adjustment to the 
speed/ref. senders. i took the bracket off to find out it was broken on 
one side.  the closest dealer is in denver and no 944 in the junk yards.  
i put a wider washer on the broken side and with the first turn of the 
key the motor sprang to life.

if anyone can find this bracket #944.101.3212R please let me know, but 
mostly i just wanted to say THANK YOU ALL!!
