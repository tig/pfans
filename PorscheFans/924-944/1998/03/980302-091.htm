Just got back from the Dyno shop and am a little disappointed in the
numbers.  I was expecting about 290 HP and only got 275.  With Farzaan
and Paul getting such good numbers without as many mods, it is hard for
me to understand.  Maybe my power curve is different.  At least now when

I get the MFS I will know what it does.

Results:  62.4 Deg. F, 29.66=0.44 in. Hg.  0 ft.  CF=0.99  RPM/MPH =
68   MAX Power =275.1  Max Torque =272.2.  K-27, chips, EH Head &
Manifold, Drilled cycling valve, Bursh Cat Bypass.  1.1 bar boost
pressure.

                64. Deg. F, 29.66-0.44 in.Hg.  0 ft.  CF=0.99
RPM/MPH=68  Max Power =247.3  Max Torque = 231.5  .85 bar boost
pressure.

As you can see Power is very boost dependent.  Maximum torque is reached

at about 4800 RPM. Maximum Power at around 5500 RPM.
Torque gradually drops off to about 220 at 6400 RPM and Power stays flat

to same.  I let off gas around 6400 so that is where it stopped.

I haven't had the mixture adjusted on my car yet so I may get a little
better numbers after I do, but I'll probably wait until after I try the
MFS anyway.

The people at the dyno shop(Dyno Pro in Memphis) suggested I get a
lambda gauge or an O2 meter?  They said with the reading from the gauge
they could map me a chip and send it to Autothority to have it burned
for my specific car which may help a great deal.

I don't have a scanner or I would scan the graphs in.  Torque was 125 at

2500, 155 at 3000, 175 at 3500, 220 at 4000 and 255 at 4500, with 1.1
bar boost.  At same boost HP was 60 at 2500, 90 at 3000, 120 at 3500,
165 at 4000, and 225 at 4500.  I'll keep everyone updated after I get
the MFS and try another Dyno.

Oh Yeah,  everyone should send me $1.00 to cover my Dyno costs.  It cost

me $50.00.

I sent this message Sunday, but I guess it didn't make it.
