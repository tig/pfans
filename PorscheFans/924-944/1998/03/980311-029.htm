>Who on earth knows how to change this on an S2 the one with the air
cleaner up under the front panel is it screwdriver time??? And after my
Vodka and orange, what do I do next..
Oh and by the way can the time wasters debate the relative merits of
this that or the other on another group??<



As one of the chief purveyors of drivel, I suspose I should take offense
but I will just give you my usual partially right advice instead.

Raise your head lights (tits up)and remove those two rubber spacers?
bumpers? airdams? by pulling on them.  Under each headlight remove the
visible phillips screws.  Next feel inside and locate and remove the two
hidden phillips screws (one on each side).  Remove or loosen the 10mm bol=
ts
and your nose panel will slide right off. =


While you are in there take a good look at your stock air filter.  Does t=
he
word wimpy come to mind?  Buy the largest K&N cone filter that will fit i=
n
the cavity (looked at ours and could find no part #).  Go to your local
muffler shop and have them bend an aluminized piece of exhaust pipe to fi=
t
between your gonzo K&N and air flow meter.  The two ends are different
sizes so make sure Mr. Muffler has an IQ higher than the exhaust pipe
before you give him the job.  Two hose clamps, slap the nose panel back o=
n
and you are ready to rumble.  If you are really anal, a hold down bracket=

may be it order but we never got around to it.  Always found other things=

to be anal about.  =


Bottom line:  more power and a nice sound.
