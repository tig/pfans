I recently had a new clutch and flywheel installed.  Also I have been
smelling oil after running my car but did not notice any under the car.
I looked today and there were just a few drops under the car.  I jacked
the car up and looked and as far as I can tell it looks like it is
leaking between the bellhousing and engine block.  The oil is
accumulating to the rear of the oil pan on both sides with none at the
front of the pan.  I have never done a clutch job, but are there
anything related to replacing clutch and flywheel that would cause a
leak or is the leak likely unrelated.  Also if it is not related what is
the most likely place I am leaking from.  Thanks,
Randall Morton
