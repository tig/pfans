$11250?!!!? Are you kidding? Sounds like a steal to me. If the car is in
good mechanical shape it is a BARGAIN. I've considdered selling mine ('90
Cab - 71000 miles), but I would want app. $21000 for it! I have seen CABs
available for $15 - $17K but they've always been in really bad shape.

For $11250 you won't find a better deal anywhere!

Just my $0.02,

\ Henrik Frank
