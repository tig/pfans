A while ago there was a listmember poll done on the estimated costs of
running 924/944's in different areas.  Insurance figures were part of that.
 May be worth looking back through the archives for, I recall a large
number of responses.  Wait, I found it.  Farzaan posted the question
originally on 9/3/97.

As for myself, I'm 20 with 3.5 years documented driving experience, clean
record, own a 89 Nissan Sentra and an 85.5 944.  The Nissan is designated
as my commute car, the 944 has a 5,000/yr limit as my pleasure vehicle.
With this setup, AAA charges me $670/yr for the Nissan (Liability only) and
$625/yr for the 944 (Full Coverage).  And remember, this is in the LA area,
where insurance is nearly as high as in New Jersey.

from vacation)
