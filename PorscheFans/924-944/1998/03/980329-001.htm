Tom and 924/944/968 fans,

Although the purpose of the racing list is stated as "Racing :Racing
events and news for Porsches and clubs," as you note the 924-944
list is where the knowledge base is.

Unfortunately, for those of use who see the list as an opportunity
to help and get help for our Porsches, I have noticed, from going
through the archives the past few years, the technical knowledge
base has become severely eroded over the past three months.  Several
very helpful experienced and knowledgeable technicians have dropped
out altogether.  Many tech questions are left hanging fire.

At this point, the trend probably won't be reversed.  Although the
listmaster designed the list to function differently, the customary
practice of posting "racing events and news for Porsches and clubs"
to this list has apparently already been established.

My only suggestion to those who need tech help is to look for the
formation of other new lists and go back through the 924-944
archives.  For now, however, in spite of the diminishing returns,
this list appears to be all there is for members helping members
with tech advice.

Regards,
Lee  larchie@lander.edu

The reason a lot of the competition messages come to this list is
for just
the reason you said, the Racing list is under utilized.  If someone
has a
question about competition with their 924/944/968 the best place to
get
the answer is right here because that's where the knowledge base is.
