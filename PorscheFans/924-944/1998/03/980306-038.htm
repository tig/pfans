John P. posted a message about limited boost (~1.2 bar on the gauge) that is
intermittant in his '89 951.  This is the protective system in the cars
computers.

One typical cause is described in Kevin G.'s FAQ.  This is a poor connection
at the TPS (throttle position switch), located on the throttle body.  My '89
951 has exhibited this problem.  Of course there are possible other causes as
well.

There is a great troubleshooting sequence in the factory Turbo supplement.  I
feel that every 951 owner that does some of his or her own work should have
one.  The troubleshooting section describes the used of a diagnostic tool,
which you can get from a dealer for about $30.  The tool/procedure pinpointed
the TPS problem in my car.

Since I think you live in the Bay Area, you may borrow my tool if you show up
at the 'stick on Saturday while we are there for our AX event.  I'll have the
tool and manual along if you send me an e-mail (Mahler9th@aol.com).
