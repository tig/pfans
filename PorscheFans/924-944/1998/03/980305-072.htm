     While discussing oil changing with my mechanic, he brought up an 
interesting point.  He said that the majority of fully synthetic oils 
can last a very long time(up to 9k) but this does not matter because the 
oil becomes polluted at a very young age.  He went on to say that this 
is the main reason why oil should be changed no later than 2.5k  because 
by then the oil is actually becoming dilluted by the pollutants(exaust 
gas, unburnt fuel, traces of coolant).  And this was assuming the car 
had a good compression, and did not consume an unreasonable amount of 
oil.  I did not think much of this until I saw an article in Car and 
Driver that confirmed that the main reason to chang oil is to put clean 
oil back into the engine, not get rid of oil that lost its lubricating 
properties.  And stop and go driving apparently amplifies this.  
I thought this was interesting because it seems that everyone I talk to 
thinks that oil just looses its ability to lubricate.  Thought I'd pass 
this on.
