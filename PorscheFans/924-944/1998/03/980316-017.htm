Gang:

Randy Morton was kind enough enough to provide me with a response on
the captioned but I am hoping to get the collective's input as well.

When I try to run more than 1.0 bar (14.7 psi) of boost, the car
starts to ping, even though I've used Sunoco Ultra 94 since buying the
car.  Any suggestions on why this would happen?  I'm thinking it could
be because the head has been milled twice (8.5 estimated compression)
but I think the car is sound from an ignition and fue standpoint
(recent tuneup with flow-matched injectors).

Randy is running 1.5 bar with no problems (with a little help from
104+ Octane Boost) and one of my friends was running 20 pounds of
boost on 93 octane with no pinging whatsoever.

Most of you are familiar with the mods on my car, but for the
uneducated, here goes:

 K-26S8 Turbo
 MAF
 Stock injectors/fuel pump
 3.0 bar fuel pressure regulator
 Stock ignition/wires

Anxiously awaiting your replies as I'm getting itchy to turn up the
boost!!!
