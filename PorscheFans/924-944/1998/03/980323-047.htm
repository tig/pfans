Bill,
You have got to get a serious boost gauge! The factory gauge is
electronic, and can give false readings. A gauge that reads actual
manifold pressure is the way to go here. I went with autometer liquid
filled. The problem sounds as though you are overboosting then the dme
gets in on the act and shuts down the party. The most common cause of
overboost is a hole or crack in the wastegate pressure line. This line
is rubber and is exposed to a great  deal of heat. A small crack here
will cause overboost then the computer shuts down the fuel.
good luck
