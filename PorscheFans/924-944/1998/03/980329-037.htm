hey all;
when it rains , it pours ! not even squared away the head replacement on my
87-924S, when today after prolonged exposure to ny traffic , my 78 starts
cutting out.
pull over , let her cool for a few minutes, seems fine. 15 minutes later, we
hear a high pitched ugly whine, and she starts cutting out again. pulled over
again, put a hand on my fuel pump and man , its hot! let her cool for an hour,
watch all the bumper to bumper traffic creep past with my fiancee' (not one
porsche) then try again.  this time i make it over the throgs neck bridge and
eventually home (barely). 
first time i ever tried to "nurse" a fuel pump, boy was i glad it was possible
to do such a thing. 
so , now i need a fuel pump (external) for the 78-924, checked the big
suppliers, they want from 130 on up, seems a bit steep. i need , so i guess
ill pay it unless anyone has an alternative or one they want to sell me. id
rather not go with used on this (rebuilt is good though) as i dont want to get
stuck "on" the bridge with the same problem.

please respond directly with any offers,
thanks,
eric (going quietly insane)
