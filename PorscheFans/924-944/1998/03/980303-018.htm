I have no explanation for the difference in country codes.  Makes me want
to check mine as soonas I get it back form the shop (hopefully this
afternoon with a new water pump, belts, cam seals, freshly charged A/C, and
a passenger side power window that doesn't fall apart when lowered).  As
for the test digit, it's kind of like a checksum bit.  You perform a
certain algorithm on the other 16 digits (don't remember exactly what,
something like multiplying all the numbers by two, chanting your
moth-in-law's name four times, turning yourself about, adding the numbers
all together and digiding by the square root of -1), the answer will be
your test digit.  It's a quick way to verify the validity of the VIN.  So
since three digits are different between your two VINs, you're obviously
going to have different test digits.
