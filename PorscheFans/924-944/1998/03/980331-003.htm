Hello Fellow Porsche Fans,

I've been a way for awhile so forgive me if this has
been a topic of discussion within the last month.  

I just replaced my t-stat this past weekend in my 944
NA and unless somebody can tell me how to raise the
front end high enough to work on the car, I can
honestly say - never again!!!!!!  There was a black
cloud over my car that day!   It took me far to long and
it was because I couldn't get two hands in there to
work the snap ring pliers.  I ended up guiding the tool
into the snap ring holes from underneath while my
father-in-law squeezed the tool from the top.  The
spoiler is too low to use ramps and I'm not equipped
with a lift, so how does one do it?

Anyway...all that hell paid off because it turns out that
the t-stat wasn't opening all the way (7mm according
to the manual, talk about precise) restricting cool
water to flow from the radiator to the engine causing
the temp gage to rise dangerously close to the red
mark.  Now the car consistency runs cool/normal
(second white hash mark).  These cars are not very
forgiving.....My next move was to check out the
radiator flow.....

Any insights or suggestions would be much
appreciated.
