Howdy Y'all!
-I saw a post in the Digest from 3-30 asking about Exhaust
tape. Lets ask a very,very important question here: "Is there
anything near your exhaust that is becoming overheated?"
I ask this because Headder tape was designed to wrap around
SS headders to prevent the convection of heat to nearby items
such as brakelines(BAD) or Electronic Ignition packs. 
Im sorry I don't have experience putting it in my P-car, but
I have installed it in two drag-cars.  Mainly because the 
headder passed right along the Brake master Cylender, this 
is a bad situation to say the least. (Yes Im very cautious on
the cool brake issue-long,scarry story) To make a long story
short: When Dyno'd the Headder tape added about 2-3hp
BUT!!! You must also install heat protection on the under body
of the car near the exhaust pipe as the temp here becomes 
much greater.  As for the life of your headders: don't even think
of using this stuff on cast iron! It melts:-() On SS its usually
ok for 1-2 hours but any longer and the Stainless Steel begins 
to burn, yes it does burn, but only under very hard conditions.
As I said I have not done this on my 944, so if someone wishes
to start a discussion about it I can only give advise from the 
Technical side not the Porsche side.

Sorry its so long, but 'tis better to be safe than sorry!
