Is the rear fog switch a different part number?  For example
might it have a red LED instead of a green one?

There are two switch locations.  As you've confirmed, one
for front fogs and one for rear fogs.

My question was referring to Turbo/S models which have
the integrated fog+driving light assembly (US models only
have the fogs enabled).  It seems that the extra driving
lights are operated via the normal high-beam switch?  (Until
now, I'd always thought the blank switch location in my car
was for the extra driving lights on non-US turbo cars - now I
realize it is for rear fogs!)
