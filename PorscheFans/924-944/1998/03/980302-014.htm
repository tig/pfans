Folks, 
  I am sending this note as a warning to anyone considering the purchase of 
parts from sv056@aol.com. I originally contacted him to purchase a digital 
clock module and heater knob for which he offered very good prices ($20 for 
the clock, $8 for the knob). I replied that I would like to buy them, but 
never heard back. A couple of weeks later I sent him another note reminding 
him that I still wanted to buy the parts. He replied that he no longer had the 
heater fan knob, but would sell me the clock. A few e-mails later, I agreed to 
send him a check for $23 for the clock under the terms of the attached e-mail 
to which he agreed. A week after I had sent the check, I still hadn't seen 
anything in the mail, so I called sv056 (actual name is Kamil). He told me 
that he had cashed the check, and had lost my address (even though it was on 
the envelope and check I sent him, and in several e-mails). I gave him my 
address over the phone, and last Friday I received a package from him. When I 
opened the package, I found a large analog clock, presumably from a pre '85.5 
944. I tried calling him with no luck, so I sent him an e-mail this AM. 
Perhaps it was just a mistake on his part, perhaps his "dearly departed 944" 
is a pre '85.5 and he thinks it is an '86, I don't know. Hopefully he will 
refund my money, and pay for shipping to send the clock back to him.

  I strongly suggest to anyone considering the purchase of parts from him to 
have such parts sent in advance, and only pay him after receiving and 
inspecting the goods.

  I would also like to remind people who are posting parts for sale to include 
more information about themselves such as their name, address, and phone 
number.

Thanks,
       Ezra

2) Upon receipt of the check, within a timely manner, you will send me via 
insured mail (UPS, FEDEX, or USPS) the following item:

 One fully functional Digital Clock module from a 1986 Porsche 944

to the following address:

I just want to make sure we are under the same assumptions. If you need a few 
extra dollars to cover the shipping insurance costs, please let me know.

Thanks,
