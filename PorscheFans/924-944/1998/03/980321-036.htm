Response to Richard Luker:

In 1996 I put a set of (4) 7 x 16 ROH wheels on my '87 924S and was
eventually very pleased with the resulting chages in the handling.

I checked with two wheel/tire places in the U.S. regarding fitment and
was asssured that I would have no problem. I bought them. Tires were
next... A set of Bridgestone Potenza RE940's - 205-55/16's for the
front; 225-50/16's for the rear. 

They looked great! They handled great!..? What's that noise?? - Tires
rubbing the fenders at the front on hard cornering and rubbing the edge
of the wells at the rear. Turns out that there wouldn't be any fitment
problems on a 944 but there "might be with a 924S".

I solved my problems in two ways. First: adjust the body. 1) Pull out
the front fenders over the spot which rubs. (I had a body shop do some
first, then made some extra adjustments myself.) You have to exercise
some care not to kink the fender soproceed slowly. 2) Use a ball peen
hammer to roll up the rim on the inside of the rear fender wells. There
is a very good chance that the paint will crack in the process as it
will only stretch so far. This cured the rear problems and most of the
front.

The remaining front rub disappeared when I installed front (26mm) and
rear (18mm) sway bars from an '86 944 Turbo. Not only did the rub go
away but you wouldn't believe the difference in the handling.

I'm not familiar with Design 90 wheels so check with the
distributor/manufacturer regarding offset. (I've seen articles om how to
measure it recently but can't find them.) If the offset is right, my
guess is that you shouldn't have any problems with the front. Another
thing to check is the profile of the tires you buy - they're different
from model to model. Compare SO2's to other Bridgestone's as an example.
By the way, I'd recommend the RE940's or their replacement over the
RE971's on a tire wear basis plus the fact that they also have good
grip!

I'm looking for specific recommendations on ways to increase the
horsepower in my car. Can you help?
