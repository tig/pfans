Howdy all.

1. Cavitation is a real problem with most pumps. Water, oil, air,
whatever. Even if the pump is in as new condition there will be a
certain speed at which the pump looses efficiency. If the pump is
damaged the problem is magnified. I assume that the oil pump in the 944
can be modified to have more clean flow at higher rpm or swapped out
with a higher flow unit, say from a 911 or 930. For 911's oil is their
life blood so I assume ( there's that word again ) that the oil pumps
would flow more and that they could be swapped with 944 units. All of
this assumes that you need more oil flow, i.e. increased engine
capacity, higher redline, fatter wallet.

3. What about a dry sump?

My thoughts about crank drilling.
If you are concerned about weakening or reducing stiffness in your crank
by drilling it don't be. A number of things will probably happen before
the crank bends or breaks. Putting a rod through the side of the block
is one of them. Then again if your engine is making that much power then
your engine life ( hell maybe even your own ) will be measured in hours
not ten of thousands of miles.

Lastly. Anyone out there have an opinion about the benefits, or lack
there of, of installing a water sprayer on an intercooler. My thought
was to have one installed and have it run at max boost only, and have
the intake plumbing downstream of the intercooler thermally coated to
reduce heat build up. This would accompany a software change and at
least 1 bar of boost on a 89 951.

1. Yes, some people believe the 944 oil pump itself "cavitates" under
high
rpm. If so, raising the static oil level wouldn't help. It does.


3. Obviously, there isn't any room in a 944 to make the oil pan deeper.
