Tom, Guenter & Pfans:

I am a little confused about the eccentric bolt. Not hard for me to be
confused as I a new to Porsches. The parts and technical reference
catalog shows 951.341.431.02 as the standard part number for the
944/S/T. Does this mean that I have the correct part already? 

The PO installed 17" wheels on my '87 951, and I am trying to determine
if it was done correctly. The wheels are AZEV, fronts are 8J x 17 H2
with 225/45zr17 tires, and the rears are 9.5J x 17 with 255/40zr17. I do
not know the offset, or backspacing. Anyone know who sells AZEV wheels
that I could get this info from?
 
Because I am confused on allowable wheel/tire sizes, and how to measure
offset/backspacing, I have considered just finding some stock 7&8x16
club sports to put back on it. This looks to be an expensive option as
everyone wants $300-500 per wheel! Guess I need some "rubber bearings",
maybe the eccentric bolts?, and live with the 17's. Oh well, sorry for
the ramble.

TIA.

Keith
