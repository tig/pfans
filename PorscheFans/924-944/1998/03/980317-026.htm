I posted a message yesterday describing what I thought at the time to
be a timing belt failure I experienced over the weekend.  Thanks to
Barry lenoble, Chris Hanlon, Greg Laws, Steve Russakov, Dave Cooley,
and Menalaos for their responses.

Thanks to the comments and suggestions I received from listmembers,
last night, after work, I went home and took a closer look at my car. 
With a flashlight I was able to see better into the inspection hole on
the belt cover, and found that indeed the belt was still intact.  I
felt better for a moment, but now I'm back to thinking it is probably
something bad.

When the engine died, the car was running at 4K rpm, then all of a
sudden I felt a rapid loss of power, it felt like somehting just "let
go", almost like I had taken my foot off the gas.  The temp gauge
showed OK as did the oil pressure gauge, but the tach very quickly
went down to 3K rpm then the engine quit.  I clutched in and pulled to
the side of the freeway.  When I turn the key, the starter makes noise
but does not seem to turn the engine over at all, or if it is turning
there is no compression.  When I opened up the oil cap, there was a
faint wisp of smoke, and there was also a very small burning smell
that I was unable to localize in the engine bay that was unfamiliar,
(didn't smell like oil, brakes, rubber, or clutch). The oil seemed
clean and there was no froth as there would be from water in the oil. 
Also there is nothing leaking from the car.

The head was rebuilt 25K ago, all belts and rollers along with new
water pump 15K ago. 

I will be taking the car in later this week and will post an update
when I know what is going on.  In the meantime any comments, or
suggestions are welcome.  It really is great to have this list as a
resource, thanks again everyone.
