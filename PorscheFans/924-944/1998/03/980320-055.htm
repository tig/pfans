Larry,

This is the second time I have read this post and I have given it a lot
of thought.  The first time I read it I just deleted it, thinking that if some
new 944 owner is dumb enough to follow this kind of advice it's none of
my business.    And it isn't.   

What you have to consider is whether or not you are willing to pay for
somebody's head rebuild if they follow your advice.   Whether or not you
got away with it (so far), is rather beside the point.    The real point is that
you are recommending that other owners thumb their noses at proven
factory procedures because there is no reason not to.    What you did to
your own car is your own business, but recommending that others try
the same thing is utterly irresponsible.
