I'm Back!  After a long, long battle with Organic Chemistry I have a week
reprieve from the school work, so I thought I would put my 0.2 cents worth
into the discussion.

The remark about using some horse sense to fix your car (specifically cam
belts) makes sense if viewed in the proper context.  You must balance what you
have to loose with your relative chances of success and failure.  A good rule
of thumb is to never gamble more than you are willing to loose.

I would be very dubious about NOT using The Tool on a 16 valve head.  There
are just too few of them available if you make a mistake.  Also, the Turbo
head is not a cheap item either.

Some people have a better sense about tensioning than others.  As an example,
I can "feel" the torque on a fastener as I tighten it down very well. 
Conversely, I still use a torque wrench on critical fasteners.  Others may not
have this sense about correct tensioning.

While it is true that The Porsche Tool can only really get you into the ball
park, it is a good investment for those who can not afford the consequences. 
I recommend following the procedure by the book.

Another item to add to the list is that abnormal belt tension may lead to
premature failure of idler wheels and possibly the water pump if the tension
is too great.  Also, abnormal tension may shorten the life of the belt.  I
have no studies to back this data up, so please take it in the context given,
i.e., may.  Nevertheless, you must add these possibilities into the equation
if you wish to gamble.

Good luck, all!

Marv
