I can understand your delimna.  I used to have two cars and since I have
gotten rid of one, I inherited a company car.  Anyway. I felt like you
did.  I only drive my P car on nice days and about 5000 K a year (wish it
were more). I asked my agent if there was a discount for limited use and
from what he told me, by having two cars you are limiting your use.  In
other words, the insurance company knows you cant drive two cars at once,
but they also take into consideration the number drivers in the house and
the number of cars.

If I were you, I would check with your agent to see if they have applied
all the possible discounts you may qualify for.  Most the time though, I
have found with the P Car if the rate is decent, but not proportinate to
the amount driven (i.e 50/50 or 33/33/33 then chances are you have their
lowest rate.  BUT, it NEVER hurts to ask! It is possible your agent
overlooked a discount.

Many companies look at the P Car as a high risk (theft, repair cost etc)
and a high perfomance car (speed, liability) and that is a double whammy.
 I have found in my experience looking for coverage that the P Car is not
even written by many and if it is, you will be put in the Standard
company and not the Preferred company.

Hope this helps.  If there is anything else, let me know!
