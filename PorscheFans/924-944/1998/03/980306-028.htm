I have USAA also, a few times, I've gone to get quotes and they were close
to what USAA costs, or slightly less, but I stick with USAA because I know
I'm not going to get screwed. They'll cover me during non-wheel-to-wheel
events (driving schools and autocrosses) and I've always gotten the best
service from them. The disadvantage is that they don't have "pleasure"
coverage like some other companies, so I can't get special insurance for my
old MGB, but then I only pay $20/month or so on it and I don't have any
restrictions about driving or parking it like many classic car insurance
companies. The Porsche is my daily driver, so I want standard coverage on
it anyway.
