BBob,

Here is an email I received from Kevin Gross a little while ago.  It may help
out.

> Officially, only Porsche has rebuild kits for the Brembo calipers used on

and

includes

result.
> More often than not, you don't need a new piston.

> Recently, however, Truechoice has begun advertising themselves as a

8783.
> They have been a fine source of parts.  I'll warn you that they have been
a
> pain when it comes to service work, though.
