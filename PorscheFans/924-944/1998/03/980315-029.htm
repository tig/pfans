Two to 3 weeks ago there was a discussion in the list about an empty socket=
 in the rear
light cluster that can be used for rear fog lights.  Since I had some light=
 holder I went
ahead and did that while I was working in the rear of the car in any case. =
 What I have
found as a word of advice...

The open socket is not the one you want to use for the rear fog lights.  Th=
e socket is to
small and in general when you insert a 21 watt bulb in there you stand a go=
od chance of
melting the socket.  This is not a problem though. Swap the rear parking li=
ghts to this
socket in middle and put the foglights in the outside sockets.  That is how=
 it was wired up
for Germany, Australia, and South Africa in 1988.
