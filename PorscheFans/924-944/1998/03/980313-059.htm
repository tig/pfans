Hi Mark! As a fellow recipient of the list, I'd like to welcome you. I
own a 83 944na w/ stock non-powered steering, and just about everything
else is stock but I replenished or replaced w/ OEM parts. My DME box has
the stock chip in it. I have color matched cookie cutter rims to match
my meteor metallic grey finish. The only thing that I have that is
non-stock is the Bursch glass-pack exhaust. It really can't "add" hp but
it makes a very nice rumble.....reminescent of a Viper's exhaust
sound...soft and muted but a racy bark when you blip the throttle. I
like it and it wasn't that costly. As far as trying to get that extra
little bit of umph out of these power plants, hmmmmmmm. I honestly don't
think there's much more we can do to the normally aspirated/non-turbo
engines to get more hp. I'd like to try to install a chip on my DME box
and get that rounded throttle cam to see if it'll make any difference,
but most of the other people I've emailed to on this list state that my
money would be better spent on a good set of R1 tires and some drivers'
ed courses. So, that's my plan.

Getting back to your 944.....since you just got it, I'd run through it
w/ a fine tooth comb (so to speak). Our older 944's have higher mileage
and more use than the guys that own the newer 944na or 951 models. If
your prev owner (or PO as we say on the list) kept records of the
maintenance done to your 944 then you don't need to be that articulate
about inspecting your car. If no records or word of mouth were passed,
then I'd check the following like what I did to mine:

1. oil cooler gasket/o-rings - if it leaks,  you'd see chocolately oil
in your radiator head tank. There's a gasket kit to fix this.

2. transaxle oil - check level and if possible sample some to check the
color and feel of it. More than likely it's old. Replace it anyway.

3. front left bearing cap - this is where the speedo cable is attached
and the hole through the cap just behind the circlip sometimes allows
bearing grease to escape at high speeds (centrifugal force). I thought I
read someone used a high temp silicone RTV to seal that hole. Not sure
of their results but it worked for me.

4. steering tie rods ends and ball joints - plain and simple:
non-powered rack and pinion steering take a good bit of stress and these
will wear out and give a "play" in the steering feel. I had to replace
both ends on mine.

5. CV joints - if they click when rolling, forward or backwards, replace
'em. Check the accordian boots for cracks. They dry rot quickly due to
proximity of exhaust, especially the inner left one.

6. clutch - we got the bad end of the stick on this one. The original
clutch came w/ a rubber center that breaks up easily. You'd feel a
clunking in the drive shaft or hear a bit of play when engaging and
disengaging.

7. timing and balance shaft belts - very important! This is more like
your main aorta of the heart. If the timing belt goes, shut the engine
off immediately and step on the clutch, shift to neutral, get off the
road and call Triple A!!! I've read other guys saying that they've ran
their engine w/ the balance shaft belt off to gain that extra 7hp! For
that, in exchange, your engine would wear out faster than it's worth to
remove and replace the belt. Even though those guys say that there
wasn't any noticeable vibrations, I'd suggest leaving it on. (Sorry
guys! No flames please.)

8. wet passenger foot well - this isn't much of a worry for us early 944
owners as since our DME boxes are mounted on the driver's side vice the
passenger side. Regardless, the battery box just aft of the fire wall in
the engine compartment can sometimes corrode and make convenient vent
holes! Bad deal. You can try to use some epoxy if it's small and then
spray a layer of undercoating to insulate it a bit. If it's a bigger
hole and the battery is miraculously staying in the box w/out falling on
your passenger's legs, or drippng sulfuric acid, reweld another sheet of
metal and spray a layer of undercoating.

Guys, help me out here. What other stuff he ought to pay attention to?
He's knew to the club and I want him to be squared away w/ the right
info. If anyone else has some info to pass to Mark or want to correct my
advice, please do so. Just the friendly thing to do for a fellow Pcar
owner, regardless of model. Again Mark, welcome aboard...... :-)
