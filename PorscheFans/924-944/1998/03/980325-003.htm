Casey:

Tire analysis can go on forever. Both your selections are good (and
expensive!). Check the www.tirerack.com site.

The 931 usually came with 15x6 wheels with 205-60x15 tires (as you
stated). There was also an option with 16x6 wheels (flat dish style same
in appearance as the 16x7 928 wheels) and then used 205-55x16 tires.
These fit with no problems. I know of folks who have put 7 inch rims and
215 or 225 series tires. European Car ran a two part about 2 years back
in which they put large wheels and tires on the 4 bolt 924. They used
Ronal wheels. So contact Ronal and see what they have. I would guess
that you could find a set of the above 16 inch flat dish fairly cheaply.
I got a set by buying a complete dead 931 parts car for $500. But going
beyond that to Ronals or ... is going to be rather pricey, and, the
205-55x16 is perfectly adequate for the car. The 205-55x16 is equivalent
so the speedometer will read correctly.

The 924GT was intercooled and I know of a 931 track car being built
which will be intercooled. But, for a street 931, where will you put the
intercooler? Even if you remove the AC.

The exhaust of the 931 is pretty much 'fixed' by the turbo position and
connection so you  cannot install headers etc.

I am thinking of (someday) installing an Electromotive ingnition/fuel
injection system in a 931. I think that would improve the power and also
be relatively cost effective.

The years you mention are interesting. 80 was the first full year for
the Turbo (931), it had a straight transistorized ignition. 81 saw the
ditital ignition and some improvements in the turbo plumbing (O-rings at
joints rather than gaskets) and, ..about 6 horses I think. I would look
for an 81 or 82 with something wrong with either the injection and/or
the ignition; buy it REAL cheap, and then play with the Electromotive
system.

I strongly suspect that the engine could benefit from a cam since it
uses the same cam as the na 924. Check with the experts. Try Webcam.
