Hi there! Glad to hear fm you, Ralph and I'm very happy to hear that you
are a satisfied customer of Tweeks. Like I've said previously, I've
never dealt w/ them before. So, if I've stepped on some toes, I do
apologize PUBLICLY. I'm also glad that Tweeks have accommodated
discounts and prompt shipping in your case. Keep in mind that every
customer and every purchase transaction is independent and individually
unique. Not every customer will get the service that they may expect in
contrast to what is available. Like w/ most any business operations,
there is bound to be cases where a mistake can be made. It is up to the
business to own up to it, correct it and ensure the customer that it
won't happen again. Customer satisfaction -- that is all I was
highlighting. I stated many times in my previous email that I never had
intentions of slamming Tweeks, and in this case, ruffling the feathers
of any satisfied Tweeks customers. No hard feelings, alright?
