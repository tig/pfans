I myself wouldn't be paranoid. Regions close to each other tend to have
similar programs. I don't know about other areas, but it certainly seems to
be the case in Zone 1.

If I ever got to the point of doing that dream vacation - driving the great
tracks of North America - I would (humbly <cough>) submit that I would be
mature and skilled enough to avoid most incidents.

For instance, I don't need organizers to bash into my head that being first
run group on the track means a cold car, cold tires, cold track, and
unknown track conditions, so slow the (*&^(*&^ down. I must admit I prefer
going to an event where the organizers do bash into other's heads the
dangers of being first group on the track, but if the speech isn't given,
I'll still go at my own pace, perhaps even slower in blind spots on the
track to avoid (in my mind) the greater possibility of incident.

Very true. I've never driven at an airport track. My home tracks are
Mosport and Mont-Tremblant, and people find them intimidating in parts -
although Mosport has had a lot of changes this past year to bring it up to
IMSA (or whatever they're called this week) use.

Yeah, I did put up two extremes, and you're right, incidents don't go away
entirely. I believe they *do* go down, though.

As for my neighbouring region of UCR, well, I think they're a great bunch
of folks and we have never had a problem with their attendance at our
events. One unfortunate aspect of the huge growth in both regions in the
past few years has been the near-impossibility of co-ordinating schedules,
and thus we haven't seen much of them (nor they us) in the past few years.

Erm, that's "to," not "too."

It bothers a lot of people. I know a number of regions are working on
instruction programs for more than just novices - the idea being to have
some appropriate instruction for intermediate and advanced drivers. An
example of such a program was in excellence a couple of months ago.
