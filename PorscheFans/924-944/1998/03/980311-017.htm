Paul,
I'm going by the Porsche Parts and Technical Reference Catalog Water
Cooled Models 924,944 and 928 Models 1977-1988.
1.  The 924, 924S, 924T, 944, 944S, 944T all from 1977-1988 have the
same electric window lifters:
left window part # 944 537 941 00
right window part # 944 537 942 01
Rich, rlhomme@li.net , I think is parting out his '79 924.  I
believe two others on the list are also, but I haven't kept their
addresses.  Re-post to the list just the part you want, and you will
recieve several responses.  Auto Atlanta sells used power window
regulators (L $165, R $95).  Try also ASE and PAP on the net.
2.  Can't help on this one.
3.  Cylinder Head Info. is as follows:
1977 924 part # 047 103 353 A, Eng. Types XF, XH
1977-79 924 part # 047 103 353 B, Eng. Types XE, XG
1980-1982 924 part # 047 103 353 C, Eng. Types XJ, XK, VC
1980-1982 924T part # 931 104 901 03
1977 924 Intake Valve part # 046 109 601, Eng. Types XF, XH
1977-1982 Intake Valve part # 046 109 601 A
1980-1982 924T Intake Valve part # 931 105 401 02
Intake Valves measured across the top are 38 mm and for the '77 1/2
model, 40 mm.
4.  If you mean by valves being set, checking and adjusting the
valve clearances, then they would not have been set since they are
normally checked and adjusted on a warm engine (176^o F).
5.  The 928 origninally sold for more than 10K over the 924, more
amenities, power, and comfort.  Fewer 928's were produced.  I have
heard they are more expensive to maintain.
Reminder:  The cylinder walls are specially treated.  Make sure
glaze breaking equipment was not used on the cylinder walls or they
would be damaged.
