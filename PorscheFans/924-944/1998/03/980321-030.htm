hello all

thought I would resend this mail as I got no replies first time.

I recently purchased a UK 1896 944, it was last serviced  July 1997 at 99292
miles. The car now has 103500 miles, covering around 4208 miles in 9 months.
It runs great and I have had now problems do far. Also the balancer and cam
belts were changed in July 1995 at 88265 miles.

My question is should I have it serviced now as it has not been used much by
the previous owner or is it ok to get it serviced in July when it is due.
 What should I do about the belts - how long do they last ( They've done about
15235 miles so far.)

Yrs needing help 

Paul 
cool  944
