Hello Paul,

I suppose we could encourage it more. I think we have a hard enough
time already just keeping the beginners happy, so I don't really see the
advanced instruction program getting formalized in Metro PCA. Perhaps
you'll volunteer to head the effort? We can always use more help...

Lets see, my last DE event was Bridgehampton, October 3-5 of 97. 
From checking my notes I see that on Friday I took some students
for rides. Saturday was a novice day (somtimes Metro has a special day
for Novices, the program costs less, they get a classroom session,
and have reduced speeds, etc.) so I had a novice as well as a 
regular student. I also had some minor mechanical problems Saturday
morning, so I didn't do all that much driving. Sunday was pretty free, 
and I think I remember taking Henry for a ride. 

I do try and take someone along for hints at least once per event.
At the Pocono club race that was VERY beneficial. No, you can't take
passengers duringrace practice (or the race :-) ), but the day
before the event, RTR had a DE. I had never driven Pocono before,
and having an extra set of eyes in the car to point things out to
me made a LOT of difference.
