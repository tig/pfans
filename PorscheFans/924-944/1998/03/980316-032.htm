Yesterday I enjoyed meeting fellow listmember Bill Catchings at the SCCA =
autocross in Meridian Mississippi. He has a great looking 84 944. We had =
good Pcar conversation.
This was my first autocross to attend and I was really impressed. I took =
my two young boys, age 3 1/2, who wanted to see "race cars."  "But boys, =
Daddy drives a race car every day!"
There was one Formula-looking car that would GO. One 951 from New Orleans=
 ran. He was much quicker in the turns than most of the cars.
Of course I knew if I went next time I would have to run so looks like =
I'll be getting the car in shape to give it a try. My goal is to get some=
 autocross video for the service video.

happy Porscheing,

Joe  <eyecare1@datastar.net>
