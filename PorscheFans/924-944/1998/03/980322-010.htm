I think Jim's new rule should apply to everyone who has invested heavily
in  hi performance after market products. If you aren't 100% satisfied
send them to Jim ( or myself ). Big turbos, stroker motors ( Jim needs
one of these real bad ), one of those expensive stainless/carbon
exhausts, whatever. Pack it up send it on.
But seriously, the list members who have Powerhaus or other ported and
polished heads, have the exhaust ports been ceramic coated? How is this
done in the aftermarket? How did Porsche do it originally?

BTW, your large valve head is only good for a door stop, send it to me
and
I will use it on my engine.  If you haven't had the exhaust ports of you
head ceramic coated then I would suggest you look into it.  The ceramic
coating on the turbo head keeps the exhaust heat from transfering to the
head.
