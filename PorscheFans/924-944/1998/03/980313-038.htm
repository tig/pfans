<< The 87 944 Turbo does not have larger brakes than the 86 944 Turbo... >>

However, the '87&'88 Turbo do have a slightly larger piston in the front
caliper. Note that this statement DOES NOT controdict George's statement, as
the brakes (rotors and pads) are the same size.  The '86 has two 36mm and 2
38mm pistons and the '87/'88 has 2 36mm and 2 40mm pistons.  This doesn't
change the size of the friction surface, so I would guess it has a minimal if
any effect on braking.  My guess is that the engineering department decided
they needed to change the bias between the force exerted by the two pistons
for some reason.  The literature I have says you can upgrade the 38mm piston
to the 40mm piston, but I'm not sure how.  I think the only time you'ld want
to do this is if you replaced a caliper on one side with a later caliper, or
were rebuilding the calipers anyway.  Sorry for the drivel on this topic, but
I plan on rebuilding my calipers next week, and am having trouble locating
replacement seals.  My current plan is to pull the calipers, remove the
pistons, and have my buddy (parts manager for my other buddy) find the
appropriate sized seals in the inventory of kits for other manufacturers'
calipers.
