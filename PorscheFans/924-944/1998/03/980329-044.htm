<< I have my doubts about
 the "original look" part, but its gotta be better than cracks.  Does anyone
 recommend it? I have some cracking in my dash that is unsightly and
 currently covered by a rather ugly furry dash mat. Kinda like having a hole
 in your pants... >>

Khal,

That's exactly my way of thinking.  I have one of these type of covers and I
personally think they're OK.  You have to take your time with the installation
to make sure it's positioned correctly.  It won't look like a new dash but it
sure beats the cracks.  I've even had some people who think it's an original
dash (obviously they don't know what the stock dash looks like) and you can't
say that about the furry dash mats!
