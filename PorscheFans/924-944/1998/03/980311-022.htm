Larry, there are no doubt other ways of 'guesstimating' the belt tension,
however, when you look at the $500 cost of the tool vs. the cost of just
one broken belt incident, it really doesn't seem so expensive.  Another way
to look at it is how much it would cost you to have the local Porsche
garage change timing/balance belts every 30K miles (w/ adjustment at 15K
intervals).  The tool pays for itself in a reasonable amount of time when
looked at this way (depends on how much you drive per year of course). 
Also consider that when a water pump needs replacing (and it doesn't always
conveniently occur at belt change intervals), you will probably save, in
labor costs, the price of the tool when doing it yourself.  If you plan to
hold onto your car for a few years and do most of your own work, it makes
sense to buy the tool in my opinion.
