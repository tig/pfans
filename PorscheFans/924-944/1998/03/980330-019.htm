Hello David,

> Suddenly having difficulty putting my car in first and reverse. Is my clutch

Probably :-(

What might have happened is one of the small dampening springs on the
clutch disc broke. The spring fragments then get wedged between the
pressure place and the clutch disc, and prevent the clutch from
disengaging all the way. This is fairly common problem with the 
turbo S cars. Most people upgrade the clutch disc to the 'turbo cup'
disc, which does not have the smaller springs. 

It's possible your master or slave cyl isn't working, and that's
what's preventing the clutch from disengaging completely. You should
hope that's the problem, as those items are a lot cheaper than
a clutch. You can verify that by having someone watch the clutch
release lever move when you step on the clutch pedal. If the release
lever moves all the way (I forget the exact amount), then the
slave and master are fine. 

You should fix this problem ASAP, as you are know putting a lot
stress on the transaxle synchros. Everytime you shift, the syncros
are forced to do a LOT of work, because the clutch disc is not
completely disengaged. If you have to drive the car for a while,
work on double clutching!

Let me know if you need more info.
