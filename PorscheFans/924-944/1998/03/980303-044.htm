Summary of my impressions on having the S2 tranny in my 951:

Plus side of short gears:  (1.)  Quicker boost  (2.)  Great for 0-60
and 0-80  (3.)  Melt the tires in 1st, 2nd and most of 3rd.  (4.) 
Less need to downshift on the highway to pass as you're closer to the
torque peak

Minus side of short gears:  (1.)  Not necessary with smaller turbo and
MAF  (2.)  I've heard that the S2 tranny is not designed to handle the
power of heavily modified 951s (not sure if both are Audi made)  (3.) 
Decreased fuel consumption  (4.)  With anything else than stock
exhaust, highway driving becomes very loud (>3500 rpm at 70 mph)  (5.)
 Decreased acceleration past 100 which is based on nothing but my
personal feeling from being in another modified 951 with stock gearing
 (6.)  Lower top speed due to gearing limitations - 149 versus 168 (or
so)  (7.)  More shifting around town could result in a minute increase
in clutch wear  (8) Not as readily available with LSD as a 951 tranny.

car.  I saw in your latest posting that you have, or are considering,
adding the S2 short gears to your car.  I was shooting the breeze
yesterday with my mechanic and he

ring and pinion with that of an S2?  He said that top end would be
affected (only 150 mph vs. 160 mph) but that my low end punch would be
much improved with the turbo coming on that much faster.  Also
mentioned that at 60 - 65 mph, the gearing would be better.
