FOR SOME REASON I CANT SEND E MAIL TO YOU 

EVERYTHING I SEND KEEPS GETTING SENT BACK 

SO,

HERE WAS WHAT I SENT YOU 

hey ,

sorry for the delay 
argg..........   i had to have my hand operated on and among other 
things i havent had time to check my e mail lately ( today when i 
checked i had 134 new e mails !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! )  

anyway 

i am still interested
however , you talked about the mounting having to have sholder straps 
for the rear seats . my rear seats have lap belts . are you talking 
about the shoulder straps that go to the front seats .  they are located 
on the posts that go to the roof .

e-mail me with any info you have regarding the mounting .
