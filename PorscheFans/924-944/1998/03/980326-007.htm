Hi There,

I have a '92 968 with about 90,000 KMs.  Lately two wierd things have been 
happening after I leave the car for a while (> 8 hours).

1.  Sometimes the car will not start.  You can hear the starter, but the engine 
does not turn over at all.  It used to happen just intermittently, but lately, 
its occurred every morning this past week.   Usually it will start on the 
second or third crank (this morning it took 5 turns).  When I turn the key, it 
sounds almost like when you turn the starter on a car that's already 
running...you get that high screech.

2.  After a lot of snow or rain or a car wash, the first time I pull out, I 
hear a loud creak from the front axle.  It's almost like something is seized 
up and moving the car is freeing it up.  However, afterwards, its fine and it 
has never happened when the car is warm or when the car has been sitting dry.

I want to take my car in and have the dealer look at it.  But without leaving 
the car with the dealer for a couple of days, I doubt they will find anything.  
Does anyone have any areas I could suggest as being the problem??  Any ideas?

The weather has been cool, but not overly cold lately.  

Any ideas are greatly appreciated.  Thanks,

Alex
