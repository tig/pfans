I guess I should add my own recent experance to the thread. I was comming
home from my girlfriends house late sunday night ... I was crusing up a
local 2 lane highway at about 95 .. zipped up to the light near my block ..
No one (appeared) to be around so I blew the light and made the left .. as I
pulled into the complex parking lot I was hit witht the dreaded lights ..
The "officer" .. gave me the usual license/Reg/Insurance card check ..
looked in the car .. looked around the car .. asked me if my license was
"clean" ... which it was .. he took it back .. checked it and found it was
... came back to me and said .. "I am very surprised THIS license is clean ..
just slow it down .. and have a good night" .. whew .. :) .. I got away with
speeding/ blowing a red light
