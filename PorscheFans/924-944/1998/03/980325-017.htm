Peter,

I have a 1995 968.  I recently changed the suspension to the following...
H & R progressive rate front springs.  Weltmeister tubular 28mm rear
torsion bars. Weltmeister 28mm front sway bar and 22mm rear, with the
adjustable drop links.  KONI Yellow sport gas shocks, externally adjustable
on front and adjustable on rear.  Adjustable camber front strut mount
plates.

It still rides fantastic on the street.  Trust me, this was a main concern
of mine as the car rode so nice when stock.  It is only a marginally
stiffer ride on the street.  I actually prefer it to stock which I thought
would be impossible.  If you hit a large, sharp dip or rise in the road it
jolts you more than stock, but that's it.  For example, the other day a
road crew was getting ready to pave an on-ramp.  They cut the road surface
from left to right, leaving a 1 to 1 1/2 inch sharp height difference in
the surface.  That was certainly noticed at about 40 mph.  A stock car
would have still felt this sharp jolt but absorbed it a little better.
Handling is much tighter, very neutral and easy to autocross.

In conclusion, I am happy with the results and would do it again.  I think
it rides a little better than an M030, and handles just as well.  Hope this
helps.
