I was shooting the breeze with my mechanic yesterday discussing the var=
ious
mods
that have been suggested off of this list.  He said that the best thing=
 to do
to my car
would be to replace the ring and pinion from my car with that of I beli=
eve he
said an S2.
He said that top end would suffer but acceleration off the line would b=
e
impressive.
This car will in all likelihood never see the track so top end is not a=
 concern
of mine.

Any comments.

Also found out about another dumb rule in the State of Minnesota where =
nothing
is allowed.
It seems that if I were to replace my cat with a bypass pipe and I get =
caught
without the
pipe during visual inspection, my car gets the label "new cat required"=
 (or
something to
that effect.  You are not able to just replace the bypass pipe with you=
r old
cat but must
instead purchase a whole new cat.  The person that this happened to had=
 a
bypass pipe on, got
caught and went back to the inspection sight after re-installing his ol=
d cat.
The inspection center
had his car "tagged" and he was not able to get inspected until he was =
able to
prove
that he purchased a new cat.  Even though his car blew 0% CO and 0%
hydrocarbons, he got
burned.  He even told the inspection people that he had been tracking t=
he car
and had decided
return it to it's street use (don't know if I would buy this but it sou=
nded
good).  Inspection guy
said - nope, the law is the law.  How did he solve this problem, he wen=
t to a
different inspection
center and passed with no problem.  Too many stupid laws, too many stup=
id
politicians making
and passing them.
