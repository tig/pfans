A query to the 924 sages out there.  My '78 924 was running smoothly until
just recently when I noticed the idle decaying after the car warmed up to the
point that the car would not idle.  The problem got worse to the point that,
while it will start when cold, if you touch the accelerator, the engine balks
and will die immediately, warm or cold.  I have checked ignition and all plugs
are firing well, the timing is at least close enough that the engine should
run, and if I manually activate the fuel distributor, I see a spray of fuel in
each of the injectors.  When the engine is cranked however, there is little or
no spray coming from the injectors.  Anyone have any ideas?  Is this a fuel
distributor problem (I have had problems with the fuel distributor before; the
plunger sticks) or some form of cryptic ignition problem (sometimes the car
backfires during cranking)?  Thanks once again for the collective wisdom of
PorscheFans!!!
