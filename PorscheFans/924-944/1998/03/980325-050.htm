The latest inconvenience on my car has started with the Climate control. 
The manual says, based on the ambient temperature of incoming air (one 
sensor measures this), the ambient temp. of the interior (another sensor 
measures this) and temp. of the AC (when in use?); the climate control 
mixes the air flows to the desired temperature set on the temp. dial.  
Although my AC does not work (and I do not need it in March); the air flow 
seemed to have functioned correctly at the desired temperature up until 
recently.  

This is the usual cycle it goes through now:

Temperature set to full cold: 1)Cold air flows  2) Short while later I hear 
a relay from under the passenger footwell (behind the dash) and hot air 
flows with fan speed increased.  This cycles back and forth continuously 
with the relay clicking for each cycle.

When the temperature is set to 21 Celsius,  these cycles are more often but 
from full hot top warm to full hot and so on.

I know it is suppose to be servo controlled but this is annoying and not 
doing what the manual says about air at the desired temperature entering.

Also, recently I replaced the light bulb in the clock.  When I had the dash 
apart, I did not see any temperature sensor/wires in the sensor location on 
the dash.

Please help!
