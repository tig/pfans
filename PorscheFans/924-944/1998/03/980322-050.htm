I just purchased an 86 951.  It leaked oil profusely when I drove it first,
and the shop where I had it looked over said it was a bad oil/water cooler
seal (on the exhast side of the block).  It seems to be leaking from that
area, and I was wondering if anyone had this type of problem before.  I am
going to remove the oil/water cooler and replace the seal, but could it by a
bad oil pressure relief valve?  

The next problem is the oil trap (plastic piece that you pour your oil into on
the turbo side of the block).  I noticed severe caking of oil desposits in
that area, so I pulled the turbo and the trap.  It seems that both of the
rubber seals that hold the trap onto the block where bad, as it was leaking
around that location.  There are two holes that lead the trap into the engine,
an upper and a lower.  Next to the lower one is another hole to the right
about 1/2 and inch.  It seems to be open to the air- nothing attached to it.
Is this Normal?  

Finally, the turbo was leaking oil too.  All this seems to be happening at
once.  Is this a pressure problem?  PCV?  Crank breathing problem?  I have all
of the factory 944 and 951 manuals, and they seem to indicate nothing.  Where
is the PCV?  Where is the crank breathing apparatus?  Is that part of the oil
trap (i.e. upper hole?).
Any info is useful, thanks.
