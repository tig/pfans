Hi all.  I have noticed that we do have some Los Angeles area
listmembers, and I would appreciate some recommendations.  As I have
recently moved to the area, I need to find a good independent Pcar
shop for my beloved 944.  I live in Westwood, so hopefully someone can
point me to a good shop that is close to me, like maybe in Beverly
Hills, Santa Monica or West LA.  I have been taking the car to the
dealer, and the $75/hr labor rate, plus a premium on parts, is really
killing me.  TIA for all replies.

For a minute, I thought your car might be the one I see at Sire records
(Warner) in Santa Monica.
Yours is gold, though, and this is a nice red one.
To find a place in the Westside is gonna be hard considering all the
Porsche owners with expendible incomes that repair places love to see. I
live in Van Nuys and started searching for a reliable place that had repair
people that knew all the idosynchrises of our car.
The place I'm using now is TRE Automotive in North Hollywood. (Tel: 818 509
0257). It's a small shop, but there's one guy there that only works on
944's. He knows his stuff. I forget theuir labor rate, but the parts are
always quite reasonable (given that it's a Porsche, and you're gonna always
eat it on some parts-and I've shopped parts around, beleive me) and
generally match the best prices I've been able to find on parts.

It may not be bad to go over the hill once and a while if you need to save
some cash.
