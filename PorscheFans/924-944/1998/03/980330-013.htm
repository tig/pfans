Khal,


A few years back I had an 85.5 944. When I purchased the car it had one
of those "dash covers" It did not look original and after a very short
while began to warp and rattle. I cant even begin to express how much I
hated that thing. My fix was a little drastic. I located a used dash and
replaced it. This is about a 6 hour job if you take your time. It's
quite tedious but not difficult at all. The end result was very
satisfying.

Good Luck!
