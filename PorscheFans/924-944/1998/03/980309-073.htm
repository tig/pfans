<< I have an 85.5 944 that has a slow dripping leak right where the fuel line
connects to the fuel rail.  Of the two large hoses connecting to the fuel rail
it is the one towards the front of the fuel rail, which is the fuel feed >>

That's what I couldn't remember!  

My '86 951 had this problem when I purchased it.  The local hydraulic hose
supplier told me to remove the hose and that he could re-swage it.  I couldn't
get it out because the tube is routed behind the rear torsion bar tube.  Too
much work.  He then told me to remove the hose from the tube and bring it in. 

The hose attaches to the tube right where it exits the engine compartment.  I
took my dremel tool with cutoff blade and carefully cut the swage collar
without touching the tube.  I also cut the swage collar at the fuel rail
fitting.  The rubber hose was torn inside, presumably form the engine torquing
and pulling on the hose.

The hose man swaged a collar onto a new hose at the fuel rail fitting.  He
told me to use a regular hose clamp at the hose/tube connection.  He said that
I could use a hose clamp at each end but I wanted a stock appearance.  He said
that the fuel pressure is under one hundred pounds and hose clamps are made
for much higher pressure.  I did this three quarters of a year ago and still
no problems.  I did check the clamp tightness after a month or so.

Hope this helps,
