>>Hi Mike,
	I don't mean to "slam" Jon Milledge, but a have heard that his work is scary!
I have heard that his stuff just doen't last. I heard that from some guys who
use to work over at AutoThority. Any comments?

-David>>

Auto Thority and Milledge are competitors.  I have custom Milledge chips in
one of my Turbo S cars, and Auto Thority Stage II in the other Turbo S.  I
like the Auto Thority chips, but there is no comparison. Not even close.

I have driven an '86 951 with a motor that Milledge custom built.  It uses
Motec.  On his dyno it made 435 bhp from 2.5 liters.  The owner's car was
previously written up in excellence.  At the time it had the Auto Thority Mass
Flow Sensor and a K27.  The owner took all that stuff out, sold it, and paid
Milledge to build his current motor.  The owner is very happy. Even without a
proper suspension (yet) the thing is as fast as the 993 twin turbo I drove
last year.

There is a reason that serious racers use guys like Jon Milledge and Jerry
Woods to build their motors.  (Woods is the engine man for the MOMO Ferrari
team which won at Daytona.  He used to work for Kremer brothers, and builds
many of the current IMSA 911 engines.  He takes care of a stable of historic
Porsches owned by a local guy, including the only 917/30 that lives outside of
the factory.  He and Milledge are frequent collaborators and friends.)
