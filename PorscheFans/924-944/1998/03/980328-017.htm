Ferdinand Porsche, 88, Creator of Sports Car Bearing His Name

By JONATHAN KANDELL

Ferdinand Porsche, creator of the German sports car that bore his family
name and son of the legendary engineer who designed the Volkswagen Beetle=
,
died March 27 at his family's vacation home in the Austrian resort town o=
f
Zell am See. He was 88.

Porsche, known as Ferry, and his father, also named Ferdinand, were symbo=
ls
of the ambitious breed of German industrialists who thrived under the Naz=
is
and then rose phoenix-like from the ashes of wartime defeat. A younger
generation fought so much among themselves, however, that the family's
sports car company stumbled badly. But Porsche lived just long enough to =
see
his business regain financial health.

Porsche AG, founded by Ferry's father, who was a close friend of Adolf
Hitler's, grew rich on military contracts until Allied bombs obliterated =
the
factories that turned out its designs. In the aftermath of World War II,
Ferry Porsche decided to defy conventional wisdom and build a luxury spor=
ts
car in a nation so prostrated that its inhabitants could barely afford
motorcycles. Within a few years, his sports car reached the pinnacle of t=
he
automotive trade, and has remained there in the eyes of many discerning
critics.

With recognition came immense wealth: The Porsche family fortune is
estimated at more than $3 billion. But sibling rivalry flared among the
third generation of Porsches. Their business feuds and extramarital affai=
rs
earned them a reputation in the tabloid press as the "Ewings of Germany."
Their bickering grew so intolerable that Ferry Porsche, who had become th=
e
company's supervisory board chairman, expelled them from management of th=
e
family company.

The outsiders he brought in to run the company have achieved a mixed reco=
rd
over the last couple of decades. But contrary to rumors from time to time
that it would be sold, Porsche has remained the only major independent
sports-car maker in the world.

Ferry Porsche (pronounced PORSH-ah, never PORSH) was born on Sept. 19, 19=
09,
in Wiener-Neustadt, Austria. After World War I, the Porsches moved
permanently to Stuttgart, where his father was appointed chief engineer o=
f
Daimler-Benz, manufacturer of the Mercedes cars.

Before learning to ride a bicycle, Ferry already had his first automobile
accident. While sitting on his father's lap behind the wheel of a car, he
drove it into a wall.

A Special Tie With the F=FChrer

At age 12 he displayed his precocious, coldly analytical knowledge of
automobile technology during a race in which a driver on the Daimler-Benz
team was killed. "I was fascinated by seeing a race-car crash for the fir=
st
time, and I watched everything that went on until the wreckage came to a
final stop," Porsche wrote in his autobiography, "Cars Are My Life." "The
rest of the crew were so horrified they turned away. So I was the only on=
e
able to describe accurately just what had happened to the car." Examinati=
on
of the wreckage, he said, bore out his insistence that the crash had been
caused by the collapse of a tire wheel.

Another road race, in 1925, changed the destiny of the Porsches. It was
there that the older Porsche, who was in charge of the Daimler-Benz car
team, first met Hitler, a racing buff who was still at an early stage in =
his
rise to power.

As chancellor eight years later, Hitler decreed that the German auto
industry should help make the superiority of Nazism manifest by designing
the fastest race cars in the world.

For Ferdinand Porsche, who had started his own consulting and design firm=
,
this soon translated into lucrative contracts with the big German
manufacturers. And in 1934, Ferdinand was asked by Hitler to build a
"people's car" -- the Volkswagen -- that the working class could afford.

Within months, father and son patched together the first prototype in the
garage of their Stuttgart home. Hitler enthusiastically approved of the c=
ar,
and with his backing, a factory was erected. But mass production of the
Volkswagen was postponed because of war.

The Porsches reveled in their special relationship with the fuehrer. Ferr=
y
asserted in his memoirs that his father was one of only "a half- dozen me=
n
in all of Germany who dared to speak their minds openly before Hitler." A=
nd
Ferry, himself, described the Nazi leader as "simpatico if you knew him
personally."

The Porsches responded to Hitler's military needs with all the fervor the=
y
could muster. Their design offices and factories churned out jeep-type
vehicles, Tiger tanks, airplane engines and parts for the V-1 flying bomb.
When Ferry's young son, Butzi, asked him why he was not in the army like =
all
the other fathers, he responded, "Just imagine, if we were all soldiers, =
who
would design and build the tanks and all the other weapons?"

Like so many German industrialists, Ferry Porsche disclaimed moral
responsibility for the uglier aspects of his involvement with the Third
Reich. Though he was an honorary officer in the SS, he insisted that he
accepted the appointment, personally made by SS Chief Heinrich Himmler, o=
nly
because "there was no way I could refuse."

And his description in his autobiography of Russian war prisoners at the
Porsche factory almost sounded benign: "These men were scooped up in huge
numbers during our initial advances in the Russian campaign of 1941-42, a=
nd
no records were kept of them. But in all, I would estimate that some 15,0=
00
to 20,000 people found employment there."

He neglected to mention that they were there as slave laborers, in violat=
ion
of Geneva conventions on the treatment of war prisoners. The Porsches wer=
e
never brought to trial for their wartime roles. In a murky affair, the el=
der
Ferdinand Porsche and his son-in-law, Anton Piech, were taken prisoner by
the French and accused of war crimes, though the real reason for their
arrest seems to have been an attempt to force them to collaborate with th=
e
French auto industry.

In his autobiography, Ferry Porsche said that 1 million francs were paid =
by
his family to French officials as a sort of ransom to secure the release =
of
his father and brother-in-law after 17 months' imprisonment and to have a=
ll
war crimes charges against them dropped.

After the war, the Porsches suffered a setback when their contract to
produce the Volkswagen was rescinded by the new democratic government of
West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer. Volkswagen was made into an
independent company, but Piech was appointed its first chairman.

Even before his father's death in 1951, Ferry had taken control of Porsch=
e
operations. It was at his insistence that the company started to build it=
s
own cars, instead of just designing vehicles for other manufacturers. The
first automobile to carry the Porsche label was the 356 roadster. Designe=
d
by Ferry himself and put into production in 1950, it had an engine almost=
 at
mid-chassis to lend greater stability.

A Business Strategy That Defied Logic

The notion of creating a new, expensive sports car in a country left
impoverished by war seemed irrational from a business point of view. But
Ferry had a remarkably effective strategy. He was offering an automobile
that could be driven both in competition and in urban traffic. The formul=
a
has held for more than 40 years.

"I've always sold the Porsche as the kind of vehicle you can enter into a
grand prix one day and drive your kid to kindergarten in the next," said =
Bob
Snodgrass, a longtime Florida-based Porsche dealer.

To quickly raise Porsche's profile on and off the race track, Ferry hired
German aristocrats as his drivers. "These were the people who had money
after the war," said Helmuth Bott, a former ranking executive at Porsche.
"And they were 'gentlemen drivers,' the same way their ancestors had been
gentlemen horsemen."

Word spread quickly that Porsche was a high-tech symbol of a renascent
Germany. Everybody noticed it was a Porsche -- not a Mercedes or BMW -- t=
hat
scooped up Alfried von Krupp, the arms industrialist convicted of war cri=
mes
at the Nuremberg trials, when he walked out of prison in 1951. "Alfried w=
as
so impressed by the car's performance, design or whatever, that he decide=
d
to buy one," Ferry recalled. "And I would say he was our truest customer
until his death," in 1967.

Porsche was taken up by the nobility elsewhere in the world. Prince Berti=
l
of Sweden jilted his old Bugattis for a 356. Prince Abd el Moneim of Egyp=
t
bought a new model almost every year. And the princes of Hollywood became
avid owners.

Even tragedy fueled the Porsche mystique: On Sept. 30, 1955, actor James
Dean was killed when his Porsche Spyder 550, a limited-series racing car,
struck another vehicle in California, linking his name with Porsche for
eternity.

Porsche's racing acumen brought the car a windfall of free publicity, by
word of mouth and in the sports pages. But racing was also the crucible t=
hat
kept Porsche a technological step ahead of other sports cars. To win race=
s,
it was necessary to constantly come up with new ideas about design, fuel
efficiency and safety, as well as ways to produce more power from smaller
engines.

And since the Porsche on the grand prix course was pretty much the same o=
ne
sold on the streets, any improvements in the racing models were soon graf=
ted
onto the vehicles in the showrooms. Anti-lock disk brakes, rollbars, high=
er
torque engines, intake and exhaust manifolds, extra wastegate tailpipes -=
-
and a lot of other equipment that sounded exotic to people who confined
their driving experiences to sedans and station wagons -- seemed to appea=
r
on Porsches earlier than on other cars.

When his father died, Ferry received half the shares of Porsche. The othe=
r
50 percent went to his older sister, Louise, whose husband, Piech, the
chairman of Volkswagen, died in 1954. Louise agreed to let Ferry run
Porsche, but she insisted that her own children be given as much chance a=
s
Ferry's sons to take the helm when the time came for him to step down.

Two of the Children are Singled Out

Louise and Ferry each had four children, and for business as well as
emotional reasons, they were determined to create a close-knit clan. Thou=
gh
mega-millionaires, they remained largely aloof to German society outside
Stuttgart. While other rich Germans relaxed under the sun of Marbella,
Spain, and Palm Beach, Fla., the Porsches and Piechs preferred alpine
vacations that required raincoats. They often took the waters at Badgaste=
in,
the same Austrian spa where Ferry and Louise stayed as children.

Only two of the children in the Porsche-Piech clan appeared to have the
talent and commitment necessary to eventually take over the family busine=
ss:
Ferry's son Butzi and Louise's son Ferdinand.

The cousins, still in their 20s, pooled their talents to create the Porsc=
he
911, among the most acclaimed sports cars of all time.

Introduced in 1963, its original silhouette remains recognizable after mo=
re
than three decades of modifications, and it continues to be the best-sell=
ing
Porsche model by far, despite also being the priciest (with accessories a=
nd
options, it can cost more than $100,000).

But the 911s very success fueled the rivalry between the cousins, as each
sought to take the lion's share of credit for the car. The arguments spil=
led
over to the other siblings and their parents. Eventually, Ferry and Louis=
e
agreed that their children despised each other so much that they would ne=
ver
be able to share leadership of the company.

"After I ascertained that the necessary harmony and cooperation could not=
 be
created," Ferry explained in his autobiography, "I drew the inevitable
conclusion and said, 'Then nobody's going to be boss!' " In 1972, Ferry a=
nd
Louise banished their children from management and restructured Porsche i=
nto
a public corporation. Ordinary shares were offered to outsiders for the
first time, but all voting stock remained within the family -- divided in
roughly equal proportions among Ferry, Louise and their children.

The restructuring of Porsche did not end the family feuding, however, and
the confrontations soon seeped down into management. "It was difficult to
keep the Porsches and Piechs marching in step to reach the necessary
accommodations to manage," said Peter Shutz, a former Porsche chairman. I=
f
Ferry and Butzi Porsche pushed an idea, Louise and Ferdinand Piech were
inclined to oppose it. And the clan's arguments often became public
knowledge. For example, when Porsche introduced its 928 model some years
ago, Ferdinand derided it in the press as being overpriced.

Since the quarrels at Porsche were so intimately linked to family rivalri=
es,
it was not altogether surprising that board room drama spilled into the
bedroom. Ferdinand Piech moved in with the wife of one of his cousins, an=
d
she bore him two children out of wedlock. The scandal grew when Ferdinand
married the children's nanny.

Even if family harmony had existed, the Porsche company would have been h=
ard
pressed to maintain its edge over new sports car rivals. Porsche sales
reached a peak in 1986, when almost 50,000 of its vehicles were bought
around the world, including more than 30,000 in the United States.

But this was largely a function of the booming 1980s and the favorable
exchange rate -- almost three marks to a dollar, versus about 1.60 marks =
to
a dollar a decade later. In fact, in the mid-1980s, the cheapest Porsche
could be bought in the United States for less than $20,000.

Then came the stock market crash of October 1987, and sales, especially i=
n
America, began to plummet. By 1993, only 21,000 Porsches were sold,
including a humiliating total of just 4,100 in the United States. A new t=
ide
of Japanese sports cars, nearly on a technological par with Porsches but =
far
less expensive, took over much of the market. Rumors abounded that Porsch=
e
would go the way of other sports-car manufacturers -- Jaguar, Ferrari,
Lotus -- and be bought out by a larger auto maker seeking to fill a niche=
 in
its line of models.

The turnaround came in recent years after Ferry, already in his 80s, got =
the
Porsche-Piech clan to agree to the appointment of a hard-driving young
engineer, Wendelin Wiedeking, as Porsche chairman. Wiedeking hired Japane=
se
consultants to rip apart and refashion a company that was supposed to be =
the
paradigm of German manufacturing excellence. On their recommendation, the
Porsche work force was slashed to about 6,000, from more than 9,000, and =
six
layers of management were compressed into four.

Meanwhile, productivity rose sharply.

By 1996, Profits are Rolling In Again

By 1996, Porsche began making profits again, after four consecutive years=
 of
losses, and talk of a takeover ceased. A new, cheaper model, called the
Boxster, was put in the showrooms to go along with the top-of-the-line 91=
1s.
Fitted with a mid-chassis engine, the Boxster is a throwback to the origi=
nal
Porsche sports car designed by Ferry.

In his last few years, Ferry Porsche dropped by his factory on the outski=
rts
of Stuttgart once or twice a week. Just as he had for the last half-centu=
ry,
he continued to mark the pre-Lent Carnival festivities, the high point of
his social season, by dressing up as Charlie Chaplin.

A short, stocky man, Ferry Porsche was invariably described by associates=
 as
soft spoken and humble. His one affectation was his insistence on being
addressed by intimates as "the professor." Although he never went to
college, he made sure, after he was awarded an honorary degree in the ear=
ly
1970s, that his name in print was preceded by "Professor Dr." or "Dr.
Engineer."

His wife of 50 years, the former Dorothea Reitz, known as Dodo, died in
1985.

Porsche is survived by his sister and by his four children, all of whom l=
ive
in Austria: Butzi, who after being edged out of the car company, began hi=
s
own successful consumer products design company, called Porsche Design;
Peter, who was also forced out of the company and then became a partner i=
n
Butzi's firm; Wolfgang Heinz, another Porsche exile, who became the large=
st
importer of motorcycles in Austria, and Gerhard Anton, who is a farmer. H=
e
is also survived by a number of grandchildren.

His nephew, Ferdinand Piech, was the only member of the Porsche clan to
reach greater heights in the German automobile industry. He is chairman o=
f
Volkswagen, the post first occupied by his father after World War II.
