eloquently stated:

belt.

I don't have the aforementioned Tech Spec book and was just going by what
was quoted to me.  While it is true that the range can indeed be 2.4 to
4.3 by your specs, that evidently doesn't mean you can set it anywhere in
that range... or does it?  Technical Bulletin #9208 says to set it to 4.0
to 4.3 on the S2 to eliminate noise.  This didn't work on my car and if
anything it initially made it worse, and now it's much worse.

The one unanswered question I have about bulletin #9208 is nowhere does =
it
say whether it applies to a new or used belt.  Could be it only applies =
to
a new belt and in reality they are just saying "use the tool" instead of
the built-in tensioner like the manual says.

Does anyone know the real answer?  Now I'm thinking I should have the =
darn
belt reset to 2.7 to avoid running it too tight.  Geez, what a pile of
crap.

>This entire discussion is idiotic.

I agree with you there :-)
