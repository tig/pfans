Hello.  I have an 85.5 944 that has a slow dripping leak right where the fuel
line connects to the fuel rail.  Of the two large hoses connecting to the fuel
rail it is the one towards the front of the fuel rail, which is the fuel feed,
as opposed to the one connecting to the one at the rear of the fuel rail which
is the fuel return. (Am I right??)  Anyway, the hose connecting at the front
is leaking right where it attatches to the fuel rail.  The dealer near me said
I have to replace it because it because there is alot of pressure there
pushing the hose connection apart more.  The dealer also said that I have to
replace this entire length of hose going all the way back to the fuel tank.
Pretty expensive.  I guess this is what I have to do, right?  Is this part
easy enough to get to that maybe someone has a parts car that can sell me one
that isnt leaky?  Maybe Sv056 has one?  Does anyone know where I can get this
long hose at a decent price?  Thanks for any help!
Mike  85.5
