Fellow Fans:

I am looking at a 1990 S2 cabriolet tomorrow for a daily driver as I have
sold my S2 coupe. The car has 69K on it and the asking price is 14500. The
owner claims to have done all the necessary maintenance within the last
15000K and says he has papers to prove it. The car, according to the owner
needs paint and a new top but otherwise is 100%. I spoke with his mechanic
who says he put in a new clutch 9000k ago for the second time since the
owner has had this car (it is actually his wife's car). Unfortunately it is
a rubber center clutch. We have negotiated the price to $11250. What kind of
longevity can I expect from this clutch and should it queer the deal?
