Hey guys!
    I have an '89 S2 and am wondering about some things that hopefully
someone can shed some light on. First. it seems that the starter cranks the
engine over kind slow, is this normal for a S2 and if you do not continue to
crank the engine until it is finally started then it will run VERY roughly
and by giving it gas will almost stall. Kind as if the engine was knocking.
    Next is that sometimes on a cold day or if it has been awhile, when you
start it up the belt makes a screeching noise for about a second. I had the
belt replaced at 45,000 and even retensioned after 48,000. (presently have
54,000).
    And finally when the air conditioner is running the car runs kind rough.
Not a steady idle, will almost stall.

If anyone has any helpful remarks it would be greatly appreciated!
            Thanks
