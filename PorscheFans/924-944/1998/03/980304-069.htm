Hello P-Fans & David

	Question: Does the red battery warning light with in the volt meter come on
with the ignition key ??? The bulb needs to be in the circuit for the charging
system to work! Also check the voltage at the back of alternator. Should be
around 13.5 volts. Check ground wires also to the battery and to the engine. 

Good Luck
