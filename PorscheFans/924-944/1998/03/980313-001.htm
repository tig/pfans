Your driver's side switch has probably failed. They both need to work to
make the passenger side go up and down (The switches are DPDT). To test,
simply pull out the dual-switch assembly from the driver's door panel
and swap the two switches. Your passenger's window should now work fine
and the driver's might not. 

In my case, the driver's switch worked for up only, and the passenger's
worked both ways. I swapped the switches around and found that yes, what
was originally the passenger's switch was the faulty one. A word to the
wise, keep track of which switch is which, or you will rapidly go
insane. 

I pulled apart the faulty switch and cleaned the goo out of it - I'm
both an electrical engineer and a cheapskate. I couldn't quite figure
out how it went together (bits flew around when I pulled it apart), so I
took apart the other one, more carefully. Yes, when I put them back
together, the one that was broken now worked and the one that used to
work now didn't and I ended up replacing it. Sigh.

'84 944.

PS - So, who volunteers to change my idle air stabilizer valve? Anyone,
anyone? <g>
