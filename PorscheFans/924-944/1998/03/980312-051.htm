Hello Rodney & P-Fans

	On a 944 Turbo, I have been told by Al Collins @AutoThority that when you
install a test pipe, you will decrease the exhaust system back pressure by 2
psi. I think Al told me on a stock 951 there is something around 22 psi of
back pressure from cylinder head to muffler. So the 2 psi drop by installing a
test pipe will not screw anything up. 
	Al did say when you run 1 bar (or more) or boost and you have a test pipe and
say have changed the rear muffler that, that is when you run into problems.
Since the decreased back pressure (no cat & non OEM muffler) change the flow
charactoristics of the exhaust system, you are changing the EGR effect
(students you do remember my EGR lector a few months ago, RIGHT???) and hence
the fuel mixture. Al said that if you run this combo to make sure you are
running a custom chip for that setup, other wise you run the risk of running
lean! 
	On a 944 Turbo, you really just can't go out and make your own test pipe. The
factory cat, twists and turns, and has an outlet for the waste gate. I look
too at the B&B vs the plain old metal "Bursch" test pipe. I just could not
justify the SS B&B unit, too much $$$! But I bet it looks SWEET!  Next time I
would take the time to send the steel test pipe out to have it ceramic coated
by SWAIN Tech or Jet-Hot.
	I have a few friend that made their own exhaust systems from the test pipe
back. They all said that it was REAL LOUD, but made much less torque than the
stock muffler! I think you need to keep close to that 20-22 psi back pressure
point. 
	I did notice the under hood temps drop when I installed my "test-pipe". I
just used my "hand" as my high tech pyrometer! So maybe my fact gathering here
is not quite scientific! Ohh well. 


Good Luck
