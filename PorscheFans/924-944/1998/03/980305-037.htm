$225 per MONTH!!!!!!!! for a '84 944 - That sounds OUTRAGEUOS to me.

I live in a high rate area (Orange County, SoCal) and pay about $1500 a year
for FULL coverage on my '90 S2 CAB. I do have a deductable of about $500 or
so, but stil... Unlimited milage (only car), 29 years old, clean record
(knock on wood), and about 5 years of driving history in this country (but
my insurance company accepted over seas driving for another 5 years, adding
up to a total of ten years).

I'm insured through AAA and they have by far the best rates I've been able
to find for Porsches.

Just my .03 cents (more left over from low insurance)
