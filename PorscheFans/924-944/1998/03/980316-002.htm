Hi Bill,

I had hard starting problems on my 90 S2.  Slow cranking,
sometimes took two tries to start, often searched for an
idle speed immediately after starting, and ran rough for
a few seconds.  Only did this when sitting for a day or more
without being run.  My P-car mechanic had recently
declared the battery  O.K. at 60k service.  I pulled the
starter motor, took it to a shop and they said it was ok.  (I
did have them replace the brushes and re-lube the gears as
long as I'd gone through the trouble of pulling it.)  Upon
re-installing the starter, it seemed better (higher rpm
cranking), but acted up again within a week.

This time, it felt like the battery, despite the
(otherwise infallible) P-mechanic's battery check
coming out ok.  So I took the beast to Sears, and they said
the starting current was low.  New battery solved the
problem.  I believe that the rough running was due to low
voltage immediately after cranking.  Probably made it
tough for the engine control electronics to do their
thing properly.

Have your battery checked at a place that can do a cranking current
check.  Sears was quick, easy, and correct.

I do, sometimes get a screech for a couple of seconds.
Don't know which belts are doing this -- i.e. timing,
balance, or the serpentine.

Hmm, this one I haven't had.

Hope some of this helps.
