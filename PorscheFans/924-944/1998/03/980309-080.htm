True enough, but is that the problem? Nope. It comes down to education.
We've all done dumb things (especially when young). A lot of that is
because we didn't know any better. Some is because we were just plain
stupid.

Now, no matter what and how much you tell some people, they won't learn.
Part of the problem is to do with the age we can get a licence. Here in New
Zealand (and the lesson has been learned and things are beginning to
change) you can drive at 15, have sex at 16, leave school at 17 (was 15),
drink at 20 (unless you are married or with a guardian, then it's - if I
remember right - 18).

Is that stupid or what?? The most dangerous activity of all, driving, can
be done at the youngest age. And it's pretty easy to get a licence too.
We'd be better off approaching things as the Europeans do (correct me if
I'm wrong on this): teach children the place and use of alcohol while they
are young. Yes, they will binge and do dumb things, but at least they'll
know the effects and dangers BEFORE they get to the point where it impairs
judgement in driving, relationships and school/university.

Here's how I'd have things: drink at 13 (under guardian supervision), leave
school at 17, get a very restricted driving licence (under a tougher test)
at 17. Give people more education, more relevant education, and more time
in which to educate them.

FWIW, gb
