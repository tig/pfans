>The ABSOLUTE WORST things to say to a police officer:

(this actually happend!)

Friend of mine gets stopped by the police, who proceed to pick faults
with his car. Seeing the points stack up and his license flashing in
front of his eyes, he came up with the following.

Friend : If I call you a *&!!"&=A3! can you arrest me?

Officer : Yes, (goes on to quote some law that Ive never heard of)

Friend : Oh OK,

5 minutes later with the police still checking his car.

Friend : How about if I just think your a *&!!"&=A3!

Officer : Well no, I can't do anything about your own private thoughts.

Friend : OK I THINK YOUR A *&!!"&=A3!

May friend gave up driveing for 6 months after that.

Have a good weekend people.

Regards

Richard.
