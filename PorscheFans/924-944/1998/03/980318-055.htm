"Hello,

        A few weeks ago someone mentioned cleaning carbon buildup on
valves by
using ATF.  Does one fill the crankcase with ATF, or substitute one
quart of oil and let the engine run for a few minutes when doing this
before draining and refilling the engine oil?  Am I better off using a
fuel additive such as Chevron w/ Techron?"

It's interesting to me that this ages old technique has been mentioned
so many times.   Here's my .02 on this:    the theory is that the ATF
would coat the intake surfaces in the engine and acts to soften and
loosen the carbon so that it can then be combusted in the cylinder.
This is done by pouring the ATF into the air intake of the engine so it
is burned with the fuel/air mixture.   If you've ever seen it done (and,

yes.....I've done this), a tremendous amount of smoke rolls out the
exhaust.   I mean, it looks like an industrial mosquito-fogger!

It is my belief that you should NOT use this technique on your car due
to the catalytic converter and O2 sensor.   Assuming you have a
converter, it is very possible all of this smoke going through the
exhaust will at a minimum 'coat' the catalyst rendering it less
effective, and at a maximum plugging it to the point that you have
performance troubles.   There may be no impact on the O2 sensor, but is
it worth the risk?

Carbon builduip was a much bigger problem with older engines, worn
rings, and bad gas.   Lead-free gas, better oil quality, tighter engine
construction (especially Porsche), result in much less significant
carbon buildup.   As for me, Techron is the way to go (or any other
additive of your choice).   It's designed to do it's stuff on later,
catalytic-converter engines.   Why risk it?

Good luck, whatever you choose to do!
