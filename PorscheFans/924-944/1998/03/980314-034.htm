DETECTORS that spot radar speed traps have been ruled legal in a test
case.  The decision opens the way for hundreds of motorists who have
been successfully prosecuted, to appeal for their convictions to be
quashed and their fines - of up to 5,000 - refunded.

But motoring organisations called yesterday for a ban on the detectors,
saying the only reason motorists had them was to break the law without
being caught. The use of the detectors, known as 'fuzz-busters', to spot
police radar checks was thought to contravene the 1949 Wireless and
Telegraphy Act.  But a High Court judge has overturned a driver's
conviction for using a detector. Electronics engineer David Foot, 46,
from London, was convicted of using a speed-trap detector when he
appeared before Marylebone magistrates in Central London in July 1996.
He was fined 100, with 70 costs, and had his detector confiscated. He
lost an appeal at Knightsbridge Crown Court in January 1997.

The decision to legalise the detectors was taken by Lord Justice Simon
Brown in a judicial review of Mr. Foot's case last month in the
Divisional Court. His ruling rested on the definition of a 'message' in
the Wireless and Telegraphy Act. In the past, drivers using detectors
have been deemed to be intercepting radar messages. But the judge
concluded that no information was transmitted in the signals and that
the detector was not used to obtain information about the contents or
sender of any message, so no offence was committed.

Mr. Foot's solicitor, Alan Mullem, said: 'Motorists who have been
convicted can apply for leave to appeal out of time, and they will get
it in the light of this decision. 'It affects anyone who may  have been
convicted of this offence since 1949. It could affect hundreds of
thousands of people who have been wrongly convicted, nobody knows.'

Legal experts add that with convicted motorists receiving a criminal
record, legal costs and fines the majority will appeal. They say police
forces could be hit with crippling bills as they will have to refund the
value of the confiscated detectors, worth between 200 and 300.

I don't know if these devices are illegal in the US, but if they are and
any of you guys have been prosecuted for possession, then perhaps you
should get one of your "legal eagles" to check the US equivalent of our
"Wireless Telegraphy Act"
