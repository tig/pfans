Pep Boys sells the leslie set for about $13.  You'll also need a 32mm
(I think) box-end wrench.

if you buy the better quality (porsche) front seal kit it will 
come with BS/Cam seals, o-rings, cellophanes, 3 races (whcih actually wear,
I was surprised, how does rubber wear steel?) and a new cam-bolt.
You'll have to buy a crank seal separately, which seems well worth it while you
have it all off.

If you decide to do the balance shafts, you'll need the BS tool, 
which I made using some angle iron and some 4mm bolts.

FYI, Steve
