  diam. and the third is a slot.  I am thinking of opening up the locator hole

<<<Jay,
I ground one of the holes slightly larger until I could get the bolt 
through (I decided to use bolts instead of studs).>>>

Grinding vs. drilling would give you a slot vs. hole and retain the 
vertical port location.  Now that I think about is grinding may be a 
better route.

<<<Additionally, one of the flanges was about a millimeter further away 
form the surface of the head (i.e., if you set the 2 flange end of the 
header on a flat surface, one of the flanges would be about a millimeter 
from the surface).  I basically just used two gaskets on this flange.  I 
figure if it's gonna leak, it'll do it this sunday at Driver's
ed.>>>

I don't have this problem on either manifold.  Flanges are all "in plane" to 
there partner.  My location problem is only in the x-y of the mating surface 
plane. 

<<<Regarding the port matching.  The exhaust port itself is smaller in 
diameter than the header flange opening.  I'm not sure how much out of 
position it would take to effect the flow much, but I'd guess you have a 
little room to play with.>>>

I measured one set of ports last night and they are pretty close to the same 
daim., 42mm I think.  It was late last night when I measured them, after 
fighting with the broken stud.  I will measure all the ports this evening 
before doing any drilling or grinding.  

<<<Good luck.

Good luck, to you at DE this weekend.

<<<PS:  Does your 1/4 manifold have the bellows on it?>>>

My 1/4 is the old part w/o the bellows.  No. 1 flange was completely cracked 
off when I removed the manifolds.
