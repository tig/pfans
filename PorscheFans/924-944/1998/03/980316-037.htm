This weekend, while on the freeway, I believe my timing belt broke. 
At the time I was travelling 70mph, 4K RMP.  I have had the car towed
home, where it is now sitting.

Questions: 

 This was a relatively new belt, less than 15K miles.  It was
installed by a shop in San Diego, then retensioned after my move to
LA, at a shop here.  Do I have any recourse with either shop?  I have
a feeling they will just point at each other as the culprit and I will
be SOL, but anyone's experience with similar situations would be
welcomed.

 What am I looking at in repairs?  Besides all eight valves, and a new
timing belt, what is most likely going to be in need of
replacement/repair, and what should I expect to pay?  The head was
just rebuilt 20K mi ago, incl. valves, guides, seals, etc.

 Any suggestions on a good (& relatively inexpensive) shop in the West
LA, or Santa Monica area?

 Thanks in advance for all responses.
