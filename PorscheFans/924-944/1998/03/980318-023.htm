All this talk about 951 dyno results has me offering my two cents. 

The following information pertains specifically to the DynoJet 248:

To get any meaningful data you MUST run your car in 4th gear. If your 951 will
not make more power in 4th than 3rd, there is something wrong with it.  

I have found that I cannot get dyno boost levels consistent with my actual
track numbers unless the car has sufficient load. Sometimes I have to pinch
the wastegate diaphram line just to get the same boost numbers I get on the
track. 
Also make certain that the turbo bypass valve does not leak.

You must have a fast reacting lambda (O2) sensor installed in the crossover
pipe to read combustion while the car is under load. This is essential for
tuning. The dyno facility I use has an excellent Motec 5 wire O2 sensor that
is computer enhanced and provides real time data. 

Experience has shown that high boost levels (over 1.1) require lots of fuel to
make power. Bumping the fuel pressure while on the dyno will yield high hp
numbers at the expense of drivablity. With the fuel pressure bumped for max
power, the car barely idles and the unburned fuel quickly dilutes the
crankcase oil. The car also exhibits very poor response until fully on the
boost. Remember that the stock injectors are already at 100% duty cycle at 1
bar!

The solution is bigger injectors with programmable engine management. An
auxiarily fuel pressure device that provides additional fuel under specific
conditions may work as a cheaper, but less effective solution.

Before a dyno run, I remove the intercooler and drain the oil that accumulates
in it. This improves the heat transfer characteristics, reduces flow
restriction, and prevents the engine from ingesting oil, which will reduce
observed power. I also remove any debris that may be blocking the cooling
fins. The dyno I use has two large cooling fans that I direct into the car's
grill openings.   

I usually install fresh spark plugs and a new fuel filter.  I also make sure
the air filter is clean and the engine oil is pretty fresh. 

For the sake of consistent results, I clamp the pyrometer lead from my DVM to
the cold side of the intercooler tubing. I try to make the dyno runs within
the same temp reading. This may require a cool down period between runs. 

The MAF: From the beginning I had a hard time buying the claims made by
Autothority for the MAF, especially after talking to Mike Kiska of Autothority
about the MAF for the 911 Carrera. When I asked him when he was going to
develop a similar system for the 951, he told me it was unnecessary for a
turbo car.  After the 951 MAF came out a few years later, I bought a few, and
installed them on customer's cars. I was still not convinced that this was an
improvement.  

I may be convinced now, as I have never seen a 2.5 liter with just bolt on's
exceed 300hp rear wheel without the MAF. 

951 chips: The theory that some chip programmer is going to remap 951 chips
and discover significant power gains or improved drivablity is just plain
false. Too much development has already been done by the top people in the
business for that to happen. I have tried to find the "best" chips and have
seen little difference between the top products.  I doubt anything's left on
the table, but please prove me wrong.

I hope this information helps.
