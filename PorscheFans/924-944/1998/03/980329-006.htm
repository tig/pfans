Hi Everyone,

      I have my boost back. I was reading a post that Hansman had sent
to I think Bob about lowering boost pressure. My mention about playing
with the waste-gate hose. One of my repairs was this hosae. I use a
10mm hose instead of the 7mm from the factory. Also it was a little
softer then
the orignial. I think that the K/CP is calibrated to release the built
up pressure with pulses from the timing valve. The 10mm hose will have
the same pressure are the 10mm, but the 10mm will have more volumn.
This is one of my problems. The other was that a rubber "y" connector
that was hook-up to the maniforld at the same place as the K/CP is
connected. It was had cracks at the back side that could'nt be seen. I
may have been loosing manifold pressure here also. Thanks for the
help. It was greatly appreciated.
