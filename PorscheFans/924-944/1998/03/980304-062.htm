>> I appreciate your concern, but the story you have is not quite accurate.
>> The part was ordered less than a week ago.  The reason that the part did
>> not ship was that the customers credit card was declined. We called to
>let him know that his card was declined and he needed another method of
>> payment.

Ok, here is the first inaccuracy.. His credit card would not have been
declined had the order been placed when it came in .. His card expired on
2/28/98, and his new card was enroute to him via mail.. (remember that this
all happend on March 2nd & 3rd!!!)The order was placed well before the
expiration date of the card (around Feb 20).. your sales staff did not put
the order in ... I know this is a fact because I spoke to him the day he
ordered the parts...


>>He called us the next day; he was very beligerent to my sales
>> staff. They put him put him on hold because they were starting to get
>> angry. No profanities were spoken by my staff. When I talked to the
>> customer, I informed him, if he could get his card cleared up by Tuesday
>>or Wednesday we could ship UPS ground and it should be to him by Friday. I
>> informed him we would not cover the cost of UPS 2nd day.  We would be
>>happy to ship UPS 2nd day, but the customer would have to pay the
difference.


Here is the second inaccuracy .. according to my body guy .. your sales
staff informed him that they had made several attemtps to call him which is
why the order has been delayed .. Calls he never received, he was not
contacted at all .. ONLY after he initiated a call to find out where the
order was did your staff contact him with the "problem" .. Your staff
informed him that sometimes orders "sit around in a pile" a few days before
they are processed.. I know this man, he is a very soft spoken, easy going
and Honest individual.. he has nothing to gain by lieing about this
incident. HE specifically told me you told him to F.. Off .. and he was
floored .. he was put on hold only AFTER he asked to speak to your
supervisor ..

>>The customer then said he would clear up his card and get back to me
shortly.
>> As of Wednesday morning, I have not heard from him.
>>

Wrong again .. he had his new card and was willing to use the new card to
purchase the order .. but because he felt it was YOUR error that the order
was delayed beyond the expiration date of the orignal card that you should
ship it second day. We are not talking big bucks here .. we are talking TOPS
$8-$10 in shipping .. a small price to pay for customer satisfaction. From
what I have heard from him and from some others on the list .. is not a
concept that Tweeks is familiar with...


>> If you would like to have these parts by friday, give me a call and I'll
>> ship them directly to you. If you have any other questions or need any
>> parts, please give me a call personally.

No thank you.. we have found other outlets to get the parts substantially
cheaper, as a side note I find it funny that when asked to speak to your
supervisor that the person that came on the phone (only after being placed
on hold for over 20mins)"REFUSED" to give him his name .. and only got your
name because the sales reps mentioned your name prior to connecting to you
... .. a funny practice to say the least when dealing with a client.. No
matter what .. it came down to a few dollars in shipping that could have
avoided the whole situation .. Tweeks took a position that those few dollars
were more important than their customers .. and outright told him that you
do not wish to do any business with him and hung up on him .. This is a
policy that would prevent me from doing business with Tweeks..

There is no reason for this man to lie to me about what happened .. he was
very upset that he was treated in this unprofessional and rude manner by
Tweeks. His bodyshop  is a "company" that deals regularly with Lexus, Land
Rover, BMW, Saturn and of course Porsche Dealers .. and is in fact an
Autorized center for them .. and only agreed to purchase the parts from
Tweeks on his personal credit card as a favor for me to save a few bucks
over the dealers price.. which now makes me look bad .. not a position that
I appreciate.
