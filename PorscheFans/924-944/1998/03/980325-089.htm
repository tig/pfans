>A bad one:

Torn boot, little grease in the joint. The balls will be pitted and worn
instead of nice and round and smooth.  The center section of the joint
(part on the half-shaft) will be gouged where the balls have worn. The
outer section (part on the flange) will have similar wear marks. The race=
s
will be worn or in extreme cases broken.

A good one:

Boot intack. Still full of grease. Balls shiny and smooth. Inner and oute=
r
sections are maybe a little shiny where the balls have worn but not gouge=
d.
Races have no cracks or wear marks.
<

Before you pull the snap ring to disassemble these little gems, mark the
alignment of the cages with a file.  Mark the same side on all CVs, inner=

or outer, so you can get them back on correctly.  If the races have a din=
g
or two, you can switch the alxe/CVs with the one on the other side.  This=

will make the balls ride on a different and undamaged plane.  I would
replace the rubber boots even if they are not cracked.  This is a messy j=
ob
and your manicurist will not be happy so you don't want to do it twice.  =


Make sure the bolts are tight.  Ours backed out on one side after the las=
t
a-x.  My eratic driving had nothing to do with it.  I safety wired the
bolts and used 242 Locktite this time.  =


If yours are beyond rotating, then you can buy rebuilt CVs.  Make sure yo=
ur
check the bolts after you have driven on them for a few days.
