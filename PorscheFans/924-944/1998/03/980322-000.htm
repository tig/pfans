First time 944 buyer with basic model questions

I'm about to take the plunge after a life of driving pretenders.  The
problem is I'm somewhat confused and I need to narrow my search down to
specific models and years.  Can anybody help me sort out which years and
models of 944's are most desirable and which ones to avoid.  I think I'm
looking for something like an '87 944S but I don't know if the few extra
bucks for a good "S" model are worth it.  Is the 16 valve engine a better
power plant or what?  I'm probably not interested in a turbo so looking at
only 944S's is kind of limiting (fewer of them, fewer years in production,
etc.) so do I need to consider regular 944's or stick to the "S" model.
When looking at non "S" models that obviously opens up the year question
quite a bit.  Which are the cherries and which are road kill - or does it
even matter?

Hugh,

Your on the right track, starting now.  Ask this list, before you buy.

Check the 924/944/968 FAQ pages. Download them and read about the various 
flavors of the series. there's a lot to know. Porsche-2 syllable word.

Become as knowledgable you can before you look at a potential car.  Make of 
list of what to look for on 944's, when you go to look at a potential "new 
best friend".

(POwners theory, known as Mullins Law: Before you sell your Porsche, your 
significant other (SO) will have declared at least one time, and I quote! 
 "You love that CAR more than Me", unquote.

A couple of other things that need to be taken into account are the biggest 
drain on your relationship , and that's even if you've been good, are the 
games of chance we all  love to play, known as CAR In$urance and Preventive 
Maintenance Program.

Not sure about Atlanta's insurance costs,  but I'm sure it still might  be 
as much fun as $85.00 to 110.00 / mo. of your budget.

The maintenance costs that will incurred are an extremely unknown variable 
based on your percentage of belief in the Murphy Effect. (What ever can go 
wrong in your case, will go wrong, if I remember correctly).  This is 
because even if you find a "brand new 89 Turbo" Black w/black interior and 
FBI grade tint on the windows, garage loved , not a scar visable on the 
looking leather sports seats, and only 18,743 church miles, driven miles by 
some guy named Hurley Haywood, only on Sundays, it is still gonna need some 
of that stuff now known as "maintenance mo money".

Maintenance expense is an ongoing consideration with these time(less) 
machines.

Now, if you still have that burning (insert pocket with a gotta now get, 
new hole treatment) desire to own one of the best cars ever made, then 
continue learning about the cars while checking out what is available in 
your area.

I recently  was in Atlanta (Mar 3-7), on one of those rainy nights, to 
watch the SEC Tourney and the KY Wildcats .

While waiting on Saturday and Sunday mornings for breakfast,  I read in 
your classifieds, at least a dozen examples of  the 944 series for sale. 
 You are lucky to have a large selection available to you.  In a Cincinnati 
paper we are as my kids says, zoning,  when there are 4 or 5 944's 
available from private owners. Gotta be patient remember.

Your classified section had a couple of nice sounding S2 Cabriolets,  a few 
late model  8 Valves,  along with a 16 Valve S model  awaiting new homes. 
Take your pick.

My first requirement in making an initial 944 purchase was to get the best 
one I could afford.  A normally aspirated (NA) 8 Valve 85.5 year or later, 
 944 in great shape, would going to be my first desire. That followed by 
the early model Turbo (86-88.5).  After that, I was looking at S2's 
(89-91), dropping the S search altogether.  I feel for me, the S2 is lot 
more flexible around town, in traffic, etc.  After that, if you still got 
money left on the monthly budget, then look for a Turbo S variant . Be 
ready to hold on to your shorts though , because I noticed these are 
extremely addicting.  You get one. It's FAST, real FAAST. soon though , not 
FAAAST enough, you gotta have mo money.

No problem !! , your still saying,  Great.

Get focused on being a serious buyer, be patient, the right car for you 
will come along. If you find something that peaks your interest, get it 
mechanically and bodily checked out, before retiring yours, and/or,  the 
 bank's mo money.

Look, Look, Look, and then Look some more. It's out there. The car for you.

Make sure "It" was taken care of  properly.  Check for receipts, Check the 
Owner pouch in the glove box, Look in the maintenance log section, Any 
dealer stamps. What's the real history? Those type of cars are available 
though.  Check the local dealer and see if he knows about the car. Good 
possibility.  Check it out with his mechanic later with a follow up call. 
It could prove worth your while, now and later.

Get him to tell you its perfect and is he's willing to back it up,  if you 
might be potential new client for him.

what are you waiting on. Get going. Someone else could be looking at your 
car to.


Good Luck,

Mike Mullins
