Hi,

>Can you just "pry off" the speaker grill?  My car has a trapezoidal =
grill,
>metal, with a plastic lip around it.  I am not sure that you can =
acutally
>pry it off.

No, you can NOT pry it off.  What you describe is the grill for the
optional 10-speaker stereo system.  The grills are attached from behind
the panel with 8 screws that go into the plastic piece, so the only way =
to
do it is to pull off the whole panel.  The tweeter is mounted to the
plastic behind the metal grill near the rear, and the woofer is attached
to the bodywork under the panel.  There is really only a quarter circle =
of
opening behind the grill at the front.

You will need to pull off the door edge rubber molding and undue all the
panel screws, etc.  Then you should be able to carefully pull the panel
out from under the window molding.  The panel is pretty thin in this area
and should be flexible.  Believe it or not the correct way is to remove
the window!  However, I have been told that you can reposition the panel
and then pry with your fingers and get the window rubber back over the
panel.  It doesn't sound too easy to me but another list member said he
did it with his car.  I'm sure a few choice 4-letter words help a lot.

If worst comes to worst, you can always call a glass company to pop the
window and put it back in if you can't get the panel out, or you could
push the window out yourself and have the glass company put it back in =
for
you.
