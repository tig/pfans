Regarding the bypass valve and the following post, one clarification: the 993
tt bypass valve is the proper part for all 951s going forward.  That is,
Porsche AG, and in turn PCNA have the 993 part superceding the original 951
bypass valve.  It is to be used on both types of vehicles going forward.

 You can get this part at the dealer, and don't forget to ask for a discount.

Original post follows.

Bill,

The 993 part has not been reported to give more power than a new 951 part,
nor has there been any data about it being Energy Star compliant or EPA
approved.  It does not even align the dilithium crystals (for those who
wanted to know but were afraid to ask)!

However, it works a _lot_ better than a bad 951 part, costs little more
than the 951 part, plus its lifetime is expected to be greater than the
40,000 miles that Powerhaus and other list members have observed the OEM
part to last.  If your car does the "cha cha cha" on hard acceleration,
your CBV may be due for replacement.
