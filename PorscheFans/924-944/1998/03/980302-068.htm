I need to get these out of the garage:

2 Bridgestone RE-71 205/55 ZR-16
2 Yokohama AVSi  205/55 ZR-16

The Bridgestones are new and have less than 1,000 miles on my recently
realigned 951.  In excellent condition, no punctures, gouges, or sidewall
damage whatsoever.  Reason for selling: moving the 225s to the front,
putting 245s on the rear.   I'd like to get $100 for both.

The Yokes have about 20k on them, but have never had any puncture or
sidewall damage.  Street use only.  The tread wear is good and even.  $40
for both.  I also have a pair of 225/50 ZR-16s which are up for grabs, but
the tread is nearly gone and the wear bars are showing.  They are good for
tire barriers or fill 'em with dirt and use 'em as a planter.  Free to
those interested (?!).

$120 takes it all.

Prefer local folks in the SF Bay Area who could come by and pick 'em up.

Thx,
