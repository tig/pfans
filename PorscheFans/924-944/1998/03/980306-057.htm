I thought Richard Sharpe's suggestion about mounting a water spray directed
at his intercooler was interesting.  Maybe sacrifice the windshield washers
and re-mount them in an appropriate spot?  Another thought is some sort of a
dry ice device.  Back when I was in high school, one of the trick toys to
have was a "cool can", which was just a length of tubing coiled in a can
about the size of a quart paint can.  The idea was that you placed that in
your fuel line, then just before racing you filled it with dry ice.  This
would supposedly chill the incoming fuel mixture and provide more power.
I've also seen guys put bags of ice directly on the intake manifold.  I was
wondering if there would be any way to rig up a cage or shelf for dry ice
either above or in front of the intercooler.  Obviously you wouldn't want to
restrict the airflow, but if you could somehow direct the flow over the ice
it might make a difference.  I also don't know if there would be a problem
with different expansion rates as the intercooler heated if dry ice was
placed directly above or in contact with it.  Just junk food for thought...

Cheers!
