David,
If you start the car and it reads less than 14 on the meter the
alternator is not charging. Chances are that it is just the brushes/
regulator assembly. This needs to be done with the alt out of the car,
however it is only about $30.00. Once you have the alt out the car
replacing the brushes takes about 5 minutes. They are held in by a few
screws.
