You make a number of good points, Michael.

What can I say.  Maybe his car handles better at these pressures, and being
a BFG rep, he has unlimited access to new tires.  Acquisition of the
"groove" may also vary with driving style.  One thing about the fast 944
drivers I mentioned that use low pressures is that they are very smooth.

Safer, yes, and this made me nervous at first, but 944s tend to understeer
anyway. Given a certain range of speeds and track configurations, a little
nudge towards oversteer isn't always a bad thing.  One thing I kept track
of after changing to a higher rear pressure was tire wear.  Previously the
outsides of the front tires were wearing quickly, to the point where you
almost couldn't get the tire to stand on end. The wear evened out after
changing pressures.  Or perhaps my driving got a little smoother.  As you
say, best to limit the number of variables at first.  But once you've
developed a relatively smooth and safe approach to a track, you should
check pressure and temperature to see what's going on.  If you come into
the pits w/ front tire pressures as high as 43-45 psi, you might consider
some alternative approaches.

I have no arguments here.  Just saying that YMMV.  Proof will be in lap
times and tire budgets.
