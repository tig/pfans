Fellow P-Fans,
Here's the info on the 944S2 Club Sport from the article by Richard Newton in
an old VW&Porsche issue. The car was a delete option car. Porsche removed the
radio, air conditioning, and electric windows and probably other items as
well. The 944S2 CS tipped the scales at just under 2700lbs., the standard
street 944 weighed in at just under 3000lbs., so a 10% reduction, 300 lbs.,
was a pretty good loss.  When the cars hit the racetrack they only put out 210
hp. only 2 more horsepower over the factory 3.0 944S2. The biggest difference
on the Kelly Moss 944S2 CS was the Turbo Cup suspension.The cars were also
allowed to sit slightly lower than stock. The cars used a coil-over suspension
and used either Bilstein or Koni coil-over shocks. The tire size was 225/50 in
front and 245/45 in back, all on 16 in. wheels. Back then, Kelly Moss found
that overall the Porsche pads worked best at stopping the car. 
An interesting point was made by John Vincent, the crew chief for Kelly Moss
racing. He said the way to go fast in a 944 was to get the alignment
absolutely correct. He said that too many racers spend time worrying about
horsepower when they should be thinking about how to get the car down the road
with the least possible resistance.The key is not making more horsepower but
making the most of what you had. Smootheness was the key to driving the 944S2
CS. The 944S2 was racing against the V8 Camaros and there was simply no way
for the Kelly Moss 944S2 CS to outgun the small block Chevy. The Porsches won
on handling and fuel mileage. The Porsches could set up the Camaros and drive
around them in the handling portions of the track. Remember the old racing
adage, that there's more horsepower in the chassis than in the motor. If the
chassis is set up properly, than you can go down the road quickly using less
hp.It was also worth noting that while Porsche drivers on the street spend
alot of money on fancy computer chips and engine modifications (me included)
Kelly Moss was able to beat the Camaros and win the Firehawk championship by
paying attention to chassis and alignment settings.
