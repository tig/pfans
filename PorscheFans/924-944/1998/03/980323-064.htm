Regarding Milledge:

Ask Jim Pasha what he thinks of Jon's work.  Jon is like many other guys in
the racing business.  He does not tell everyone all he knows free of charge.
People in the "performance business" are different.  The structure of a
business like The Racer's Group, Powerhaus, and Windward is very different
from Jon's.  These are all good companies, but their business structure is
different from Jon's.  They sell primarily products.

People at racing places like KMR, Jerry Woods Enterprises, and Jon are in the
racing business to make money.  They will give you a lot of valuable info.  I
have spent hours on the phone with Jon.  He has saved me a lot of money and
grief.  But I respect the fact that he has to keep certain info proprietary.
That is inherent in the structure of his business.  Expecting Jon, Jerry
Woods, or David or Jeff Stone to freely disclose everything, especially when I
am not a customer is like expecting to buy Porsches at wholesale.  I expect a
discount, not a gift.  Porsche is not in the business of giving gifts,
although I kind of wish they were.

If you saw the finish at Daytona, do you think that Jerry Woods would tell Rob
Dyson all of his "secrets" in leading the MOMO Ferrari engine building
program?

People in the performance business sell things like Mass Flow Sensors, cone
filters and items which are popular "do dads."  They may or may not actually
work, but they provide an opportunity to make a profit.  For example, Windward
sells cone filter kits for 951 cars, but admits that they do nothing to help
performance.  This is okay-- people (especially American car nuts) constantly
spend money on do dads.

But racing businesses sell services and information.  They cannot protect
themselves with patents and trademarks cost-effectively.  They are constantly
preyed upon by performance businesses.  A good example is the Windward copy of
Milledge's air/foam eliminator.  Another good example is brake adapter kits.
Someone comes up with something, and someone else copies it.  Then they call
each other names (e.g., The Racer's Group and Windward, or TRG and Powerhaus).

By the way, business like Paragon Products represent yet another genre.  Good,
honest aftermarket performance product provider not caught up in the "club
racer world" of TRG, WIndward and Powerhaus.

So, from now on, I will not mention Milledge on the 924-944 List.  I will only
mention him on the Racer List.

We do not live in a Communist country.  There is no free lunch.
