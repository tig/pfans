Mikee Mikee Mikee, what you fail to understand is that I wasn't suggesting the
blue bulbs as a lighting upgrade, but merely as a way of making your car not
quite look like every other car out there.  That's all.  They light like a
standard H-4, same pattern, same brightness, but look a little different when
you look at them.  Nope, no xenon, or kryptonite in them at all...but then
again superman wore the bright colors to look good....not because they were
more aerodynamic  ;)   The blue bulbs look good, and I won't tell the rest of
the world they aren't genuine 1998 xenon bulbs if you won't tell them my
Porsche is over 10 years old.

Don't get offended, Michael, I'm just joshin' ya.  Just returned from a day at
Daytona Bike Week, after which we spent the majority of the 45 minute ride home
at speeds greater than my Porsche could dream of getting to...hence my great
mood.

DISCLAIMER:  Naturally the above depiction of triple digit speeds is a
fictitious story told merely for the entertainment of the Porschefans, and
should not be taken as a confession by any of the officers of the law on this
list.  :)
