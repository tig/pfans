No, but aspiring to be.

difference?
Compared to the K-27T6, the car is a little softer on the top end. 
However, I now have nearly instantaneous boost with essentially no lag
(compared to a significant amount of lag with the K-27).  The car
feels like its making full boost as low as 3000 prm as opposed to 4500
rpm before.  I love it!

>   What do you mean by the K26S.  Is this the re-worked K-26 (K-27
compressor) or is this the turbo cup turbo.  What size housing do you
have on the turbo?  Different people seem to have different definitions.

This turbo is the standard turbo from the 1988 951S or the 1989 951. 
It has the #8 (larger) housing while utilizing the smaller K-26
compressor side.  I received mine on trade for my used K-27T-6 (larger
compressor, smaller housing) which was modified by Mike Levitas at
Turbo Performace Center (TPC) for increased driveability over the
Powerhaus unit (at least that's what my mechanic told me, there was a
minor  difference in reduced lag).

> 3.  What did you pay for the Mass Air Flow kit.  I am assuming it is
the AutoThority system.  
I paid $1,800 minus a $150 credit for my APE chips on trade.

> 4.  Did you do the installs yourself or have it done elsewhere?  How
hard was it?
I had my mechanic do it.  I'm not sure how many hours he spent on it
as he also installed the used turbo and a refurbished cylinder head at
the same time.

> 5.  Any mods to the fuel system?
Only a 3.0 bar fuel pressure regulator from Powerhaus (will be
switching to the factory Bosch rising rate regulator from Windward
ASAP for $189.00)

> 6.  What boost level do you run?
I'm not sure, my mechanic tells me between 14 and 16 pounds (1.0 -
1.1. bar).  My wastegate is screwy at the moment and I will be
switching to a HKS dual port unit when I purchase a boost controller
in the next couple months.
 
> If you were just starting to modify your car, where would you start
knowing what you know now.  I have a 87 951 that I only plan on using
on the street.  I am looking for more usable street hp since the car
will not be tracked.  My only mods are an AutoThority 2.7 chipset and
a 993 compressor bypass valve.  I am also installing a boost gauge.  I
am ready for more.
Personally, I still think that the bigger K-27T doesn't offer enough
drivability for the street unless you increase displacement, do some
intake/cylinder head Extrude Honing, or have the Mass Air Flow system.
 By no means am I an expert but I would move to the slightly larger
K-26S unit (about $800 -$900 rebuilt or $400 used) which should give
you some more top end and then go with the MAF system.  Exhaust and/or
a cat bypass pipe may net you a few hp as well.  Cranking up the boost
will bring smiles but can also bring much grief.  Finally, (and I know
this will spark some debate), nitrous oxide still offers the most
"bang for your buck" and can eliminate the lag associated with huge
turbos.  My roommate/mechanic uses a 50hp shot in first gear only to
get his C2 Turbo's huge K-36S turbo spooling up faster.  It all
depends on how much you're willing to spend and what you want to
accomplish.  I would definitely talk with Powerhaus and/or Windward
Performance as they are the experts.  Powerhaus has a step-by-step
upgrade list which can be found at www.powerhaus.com/contents.htm. 
Windward has a similar menu which can be found through the Platz Mall
at platz.com.  I'm also sure that our good friends on the "list" will
be able to offer additional insight.

> I think I saw that you also posted something about boost controllers
from Turbo Performance Center.  Any experience with them?

The TPC unit was mounted in a 951 with the K-27T turbo and custom
chips.  The owner likes the unit as he doesn't wish to have the
learning curve feature of the HKS, GReddy or Apexi units which I have
seen in a variety of other cars (one C2Turbo and a bunch of Surpa TTs,
Eclipse/Talons, and last generation RX-7s).  They more complicated
units are much more expensive ($550 v. $200) but provide many more
features.  In speaking with drivers who have used the HKS EVC IV, they
swear by it as it allows them to program in high and low boost
settings as well as overboost duration.

> Spinning wheels in three gears sounds good to me.
It is fun but thank God for rev limiters!!!
