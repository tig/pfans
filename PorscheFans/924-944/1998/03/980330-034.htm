Hi all, just thought I would post an update.  About two weeks ago I
sent a couple of posts about a probable timing belt failure on my '83
944.  Thanks again to all who responded, you know who you are.

I had the car serviced by fellow listmember Steve Russakov in
Huntington Beach.  Many thanks to Steve for a job well done, the car
runs as well or better than it ever has, smooth as silk.  

Here is the interesting part. The car had just recently had new belts,
rollers and water pump 17K ago, so it was a mystery what caused the
belt to fail.  What happened was actually in the cam housing, not
related to the belt at all.  Upon taking the head off, all the valves
were trashed, as might be expected.  When removing the cam housing,
one of the lifters, which had been quite noisy for the last couple of
months, showed very unusual wear.  The end of the lifter which is in
contact with the cam lobe was worn concave to the point that there was
actually a hole in the metal.  In addition, a small peice (1/2 inch
long) of the cam housing itself, from the edge of where the lifter
slides back and forth, had broken off and jammed in the cam, locking
it up while I was cruising on the freeway.  This lockup stripped the
cam belt and caused the catastrophic failure.  I have talked to
several very knowledgeable Porsche mechanics and none had ever seen or
heard of this type of failure before.  I figured since it was "one for
the books" that the list might as well hear about it.

So new cam, cam housing, lifter, rebuilt head, valves, belts, etc.
later, the car is back to itself.  So much for the paint job I was
going to get this summer, though.  Thanks again to Steve R. for a
great job of breathing life back into my baby.
