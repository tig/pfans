A way of dealing with Allstate ( or any other insurance carrier) is to build a relationship
with the sales rep. He is incented to sell certain 'high-margin' policies. Selling auto
insurance to young drivers with sports-cars is a money loosing business at best.
If you have a combination of policies with one carrier you will generally be treated better. 

1. At your age a life insurance policy is cheap to you and very attractive to them,
2. If you rent your living space, get a renters policy from them,
3. If you own then move your homeowners,
4. If you and/or your significant other have multiple carriers for different cars, consolidate
under one carrier.
5. Keep a relatively good driving record

Then ask to insure a sports car. You will be surprised at the difference. The risk on
the car is less than the potential profits from the other policies (which you need
anyway).

FYI. Allstate use to have a rule that they would not insure Corvettes, Z28's, Firebirds,
911's, etc. if the owner wasn't already a 'good' customer (see 1-4 above). You also will
have it easier as you get older. One of the many advantages to surviving youth!

Good luck
