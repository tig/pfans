I found this on a recent BMW digest posting.  The message was in
response to a question about any advantages turbocharged cars have at
higher altitudes.  Somehow, the 951 was mentioned but the comments
weren't exactly flattering.  It's interesting to note how those who
"don't know" will never know and be able to appreciate these wonderful
cars for what they are and can achieve on the track.  Oh well, he'll be
surprised when his '87 325is gets smoked by a 951 and a NA 944 gives him
a run for his money...

Ian & others,

I have looked ino AA stage 2 kit & like what I see.
Being a bit money strapped for the rest of '98 I am putting
off pressurizing Franky until next year if ever.

However, being a big fan of Speedvision, and naturally being a track
junkie
for more than a few years, I would have to say that turbos have a big
advantage
over other cars at altitude.

Case in point, First race at new track in CO (your neck of the woods)
proved a Supra
domination with the twin turbo RX-7 close on its heels.  Every 10
minutes
the announcers
were beating home the point that the turbos benefited over the big hp V8
boys at
altitiude.  Poor Stu was thrashing that Trans Am , but could not keep up
even though the T/A
had the same if not slightly more hp (hp tested at a lower altitiude for
sure).

Caveat:  I don't own a turbo.  Like the idea of a turbo, but never drove
one that measured
up to a stout normally aspirated car.  (turbos driven: '89 944 Turbo (no
balls below 5k rpms, period.  don't see
the following it has, 300zx tt nice, but not as strong as a lt1
corvette)

Still interesting in pressurizing, but I will have to drive one that
impresses me before I plunk my money down.
