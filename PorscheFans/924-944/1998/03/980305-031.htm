>>Now, this is cool.  What he said to do is to copy the rally teams method,
but to go as extreme.  You can water cool the caliper, but it involves
too much work, so the other trick they use is to pump the brake fluid
through the system.  Demon Tweeks latest catalogue has such a pump (I
didn't even notice it until he mentioned it).  By pumping the brake fluid
through the system, it would act like coolant in a radiator.  By the time
the hot fluid moves around, it cools before it gets back to the caliper.<<

This technology is not really that new. I friend of mine with a 5 year old
Trans Am car had brake fluid recirculators. The latest Circle Track magazine
has an article on brake systems, which mentions this system. 

The only negative I have heard is poor pedal. The brake recirculators work as
a controlled leak that returns the hot fluid from the brake calipers back to
the master cylinder reservoir.  Sometimes this makes the brake pedal soft.

This system can easily be plumbed into the calipers at the bleeder screw
fittings,since you no longer have to bleed your brakes with this system.
