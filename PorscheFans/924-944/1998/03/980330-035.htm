Howdy all....new to the list!
My 1988 n.a.944 seems to go through oil like it is going out of style. It
doesn't seem to burn tonnes in the exhaust (a bit mabey..), and it is not
leaking pools under the car. There is from time to time a single drop or
two under the car (gasp!) but nothing compared to the amount that seems to
be dissapearing. I go through about a pint every two hundred miles....help!
The car had some "mixing" (oil in the coolant and visa vearsa) when I
bought it...which I spotted immediately, and took it in to the shop and
they found the head was warped a bit and had to mill it. There has been no
mixing observed since then. I have not had it long enough to know how it
was on oil before. Finding this list was (I hope) a blessing!The car runs
fantastic otherwise. 

What could my problem be?
How can I fix it?
Can I do it myself?
Any Ideas on cost?

Thanks for you help!

Also, I would be interested in hearing from any local P-fans here in the
great white north!
