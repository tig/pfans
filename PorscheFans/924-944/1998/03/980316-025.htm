I was recently able to fix a bad DME on my '83 944 using the trial and
error method.  As an electronic hobbyist, I swapped out a few components
and the brain began working again.  So far so good!
There is little information about DME's, specifically schematics, but it
got me thinking that these little brains aren't that complex.  Someone
motivated enough could rig up with a tester, powered by an old 386, for
example, or come up with a troubleshooting guide for the DME.
I feel that I'm motivated to do this.  Trouble is, I don't the DME's to
experiment on.  According to a local dealership, most of the DME's go
back to the factory and customers are refunded a core charge.
Therefore, I'm taking any and all suggestions on how to get my hands on
some broken brains.  Maybe some of you have 944 DME's that have had fire
or water damage and are beyond repair?  Perhaps a junk yard with lots of
944 DME's?
