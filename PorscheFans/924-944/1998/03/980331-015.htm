There have been a few times that the list has screwed up and EVERYONE got
dumped.  I wouldn't blame it on the 928 guys unless you have real proof.

>All this talk about tech and non tech, well I think the answer is the
>"NTECH" in the title! easy, simple, and it works!

It's also not needed.  If we can't figure out whether the note is =
technical
or not from reading subject title, then I think we need more help than =
NTECH
can provide.

I do think it is a good idea to put 924, 944, 968, 951, S2 or such in the
subject if the post applies specifically to one of those cars.
