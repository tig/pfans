>Your repair may be good for low pressure systems, but the 944 and 944
Turbo are high pressure systems.  Eventually, you will end up with a
leak that will have catastrophic results...

David,

As usual, George is 100% right, I'm sure he has several burned up engines=

on his lot to prove his point. The extra turbo engine I have was pulled
from a car that was totaled due to an engine fire and my own fireball
experience is proof positive that turbos are not hard to light on fire.

Don't screw around with the pressurized fuel line and contact PCNA to see=

if your car has had the free fuel line upgrade.
