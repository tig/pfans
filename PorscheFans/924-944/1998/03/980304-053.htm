Seriously, I did get the complete page, too a while.  After looking at the
source document, I think that the image size defined (HEIGHT=xxx
WIDTH=xxx) looks like it was defined too small for the image and clips the
bottom of it, thus I see only the roof of the 911.  The gibberish might
have been an interleave gif (or whatever they are called) that looks
better as the download continues.
