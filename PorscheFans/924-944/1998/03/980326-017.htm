Bill,

Consider the source.  Last I checked Tom didn't even have a CO%
machine.  As I live here in Tulsa, and have been an active member in the
local club since 93, I have realized there are no requirements for being
a 944 tech chairman for PCA.  That statement about never using or owning
the tool just illistrated that point.  As with the vast majority of the
club members here, I don't use a shop that doesn't believe in the proper
tools the factory says to use.  There have been way too may problems
with members cars around here from those shops.

And for what Jim Vienneau wrote about paying the shops that don't use
the tool. Well there is a prime example, and that's why most of us
locally don't use Tom.  But having been an ASE certified mechanic many
years ago and working at GM & Ford dealers, I always used the correct
tools.  As did all the dealers and mechaince I worked with.  I guess
it's just the difference in being a professional.  If you have a
mechanic that doesn't take the time to buy or use the proper or correct
tools, well there's where the the term "shade tree" comes from.  If you
think all timing belts are created equil, then just take your Porsche to
"Bill's do all auto service" that specializes in Honda repair!

This entire discussion is pointless, if people know better and don't do
better, then so be it, they will be the loosers in the long run.
Remember "a person convinced against their will, is of the same opinion
still".

This is in reply to the timing belts letters.  I have talked to Tom
Charlesworth about this and he says he sets his own without a tensioning

tool.  He says that he has never seen one set to tight, only too loose.
I have never asked Jim Pasha about it but he would be a good one to ask,

as he is the Guru in Excellence magazine.

By the way Tom Charlesworth is the dude that writes 944 advice for Pano.
