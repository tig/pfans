When I got my 944S last summer, remember when Dave came down to Denver, I
transfered the same policy that I had on my truck directly over to the
Porsche and upped the deductible from $100 to $250. My insurance premiums
went up $60 per six month period. That's with State Farm and I've had no
problems with them, I've got a 17 year old driving now and for coverage on
all 3 vehicles I'm only paying around $1200 per year. His insurance was the
kicker but that's another thread.
I dropped Allstate many years ago when they decided that the insurance on a
69 Boss 302 should be in the neighborhood of $1200 per six months then
wouldn't cover a hit and run that occured while my car was parked in a
public lot without raising my rates again!
