     Hi Keith, this problem vexed me for years until i found it!  It is 
     your fuel pressure regulator and/or fuel pressure damper.  I had the 
     exact same symptom as you.  I replaced the FPR first and it fixed the 
     problem, i replaced the regulator anyway since they seem to be similar 
     in design and function.  In case you don't know, they are on the ends 
     of the fuel rail and easy to replace.
     
     I'll send this to you and the digest since i have never successfully 
     sent anything to the digest.

     Subject: cold start problem
     
     My '88 944 will never start from cold with first turn of the key,
     regardless of how long I let the engine turn over. However, it will
     always start immediately on second turn, even if the first turn was
     only for one second.
     
     Any suggestions?
