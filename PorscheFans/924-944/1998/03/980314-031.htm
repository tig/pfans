I have a 90 S2 cab now, and the only thing I recommend you do is check the
seals on the cab.  When driving it, make sure there are air leaks, and when
washing it make sure it doesn't have water leaks as well.  Seals are
incredibly expensive, so be sure to check those.  If it is not a daily driver,
this isn't as important.

As far as which one to buy....

Obviously, if you are looking for sheer performance, there is but one choice,
the 951.  There is so much power potential out of that car, it's amazing.

However, if you are looking for looks (IMO) and stop and go performance, the
Cab is for you!  Look at the price of the rest of the roadsters in the market
right now (Boxster, SLK, Z3), they are well into the upper 30's -40's range.
For the price of the S2cab, you cannot go wrong!  The Cab will most definately
hold it's own with the rest of the current roadsters with numbers like 0-60 in
6.1sec, 1/4mile in 14.7sec (Car and Driver- Nov. 89).  Compare these numbers
with the rest of the group (minus the ZM3) and they are very close if not
better.  Don't forget the beauty and rarity of the S2 cab.  To the untrained
eye, most think it is a 98 model Porsche, especially if you put on some newer
wheels (993 TT replicas, I highly recommend).

Like I said, sheer hp for the buck, go for the 951.  If you are looking for an
extremely fun car, with GOBS of usuable torque, and competition with the
boxster, SLK, and z3, go for the Cab.  There nothin like drivin with the top
down!
