My $.02 on the captioned:

I'm 27 years old and pay $1,400 per YEAR for my 951 with dual airbags
and no ABS.  The car is classified as "Pleasure only", is driven an
estimated 4000 miles/year and is garaged in a Connecticut suburb.  I
have one reckless driving charge (I was being tailgated and sort of
got a little over anxious to leave the car behind) and one accident
(my fault) in the last three years.  Coverage includes
comprehensive/collision with standard limits.

The $1,400 a year does not include the "dividend" of 10-25% that my
insurance co., USAA, gives to its members as a return premium.  This
past year, I received a dividend of 25% which took my annual premium
down to $1,050!!

USAA is only available to those people who are either on active or
retired duty in the U.S. armed forces as well as the reserves and
their immediate family members (my father was in the Navy many years
ago).  They handled my one accident  pretty well (at least they didn't
try to total the car).
