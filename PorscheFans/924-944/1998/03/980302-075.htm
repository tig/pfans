I don't think this message made it to the list, so I'm going to try again.
I've ask this question before but, did not receive a definitive answer.
Does anyone know for sure what stopsthe the sunroof in the retracted
position? In other words what prevents the
plastic gears in the mechanisms from being stripped? I used to think that
the two limit switches that are ganged together on the motor assembly did
it. However, they just stop the roof when going from the open to the locked
position or from the retracted to the locked position. When lowering the
sunroof (ignition position 2), limit switch I gets made first which stops
the roof in the locked position. If you then got to ignition position 1, as
soon as you move the arms toward the retracted postion, limit switch 2 gets
made. The arms continue to move to the fully retracted position with limit
switches 1 and 2 made. As you move the lifting arms from the retracted
position to the locked position, the arms stop as soon as limit switch 2 is
released. So what stops the arms at the retracted position? The third limit
switch on the motor assembly (Feb. 86 and newer) stops the roof in the
fully raised position. The only thing I can figure is that when the arms
are fully retracted to their mechanical stop, the slip clutch on the
sunroof motor prevents the plastic gears from getting stripped. Otherwise,
why would you have a slip clutch? The low torque value for the slip clutch
(6 +/- 0.5 Nm) leads me to believe that this is what protects the gears
although I can't find anything in the workshop manual that says for sure.
If anyone can provide some insight into this I would be eternally grateful.
I've fixed a number of sunroofs over the past couple of years but, this is
one aspect of sunroofs that still has me scratching my head. I've been
developing a troubleshooting procedure for 944 sunroofs but, until I have a
complete understanding of what causes the gears to strip, I don't think I
can complete it. 

TIA,
Clark Fletcher
