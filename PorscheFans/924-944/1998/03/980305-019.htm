I found the same silly regulations when I decided to buy my 931 (924 turbo).
Get this; my 931 (now 14 psi boost and ~200 HP) is still considered to be
in the 914/924 category and I get much lower insurance rates than I would 
for any NA 944.  I guess you 944/968 guys are paying extra for those dangerous 
wide fenders. :-)

My advise is to shop around.  Unless you are commited to Allstate in some 
religious fashion, I'm sure you can find a better deal somewhere else.  Many
years back, I switched to Nationwide Mutual on my car and found they also 
could save me $100's a year on my homeowners insurance in the particular fire
protection class I was in (rural, no fire hydrants for miles).  FWIW, Consumer 
Reports has a nice article on auto insurance this month.

Good Luck.
