Last fall I purchased an '89 944 Turbo Cabriolet (I know, they don't 
exist).  The car is silver with a black convertable top.  The door window 
frames were chopped, a trunk area and lid were fabricated, and a manual 
fold down top was added that hooks to the A-pillars with latches that 
require a key to open and close.  I have very limited information on the 
history of the car, but I believe it was a conversion job done by a shop 
in New Jersey that was not a one-off car (sort of like a Saleen Mustang 
operation).  If anyone has seen or heard of a car like this before or 
knows if this was an aftermarket "production" job, I would greatly 
appreciate any information (hearsay or otherwise).  Of further interest, 
the car had a couple of other modifications.  The rear license plate was 
mounted to a fold down hinge and behind the plate was a driving lamp 
mounted rearward (usefull for evading the police?).  Additionally, the 
passenger side airbag was removed, and an aluminum box was fabricated to 
take its place.  The airbag door was hinged at the top side and magnetic 
switches with protruding pins were mounted at the bottom to secure the 
door in place.  This created a hidden stash box to contain what I 
imagine to be something of an illegal and possibly powdered nature.  
There were various relays and switches connected to these "options" to 
control the devices.  The rear defogger switch, trip odometer reset 
button, a couple of console mounted rocker switches, and drivers side air 
vent (with an added pressure switch) were all wired to somehow control 
the license plate/driving light and air bag stash box.  It's not exactly 
a car destined for any original/restored trophys on the concourse, but 
it's definitely a lot of fun!
