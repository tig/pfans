Ha!...I thought that would get everyones attention.  My change in internet
providers to SLOW...SLOW....aol, and its short mail file has not enabled me to
view the Pfans list for a while.  Until I get my provider worked out, I very
seldom read the list.  Everyone should feel free to e-mail me with questions,
though.

Just a note...just my own thoughts, so don't anyone slam me please...if the
list were a little more concise and to the point about situations concerning
the cars, and not someone's "trip to bountiful" and "how you felt the wind
rush through your hair" etc.,....in other words, some articles are so wordy
and the articles really have nothing to do about the 924-944's...there is a
general list for porschefans...I wind up barely skimming the surface of the
list..looking for good solid problems to try to help others.  I wish some
would use the other porschefans general list to spout the rhetoric......just
my thoughts...maybe I am just as guilty as the next guy.
