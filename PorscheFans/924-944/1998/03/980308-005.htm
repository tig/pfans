    To remove the whole panel you need to remove the quarter window and door
trim, and a couple of screws. Becareful as the are push fasteners hidden
 like a door panel ) and are easy to pull out of the fibre board. Then
carefully separate the material from the window and door jam and where it
overlaps other panels. You have to glue it all back together and rope the
widow back in. This is a horrible job and I seriously recommend avoiding it.
You may be lucky and "this trapezoidal grill" is removable. I'm guessing
that they added that little grill to make it easier.. Older cars just have
the panel perforated enough to let some crappy sound out. I would check with
your local stereo shop or Porsche dealer to see. I would be damn sure the
the speaker is bad by checking continuity of both wires from the head unit
to the speaker. You can access these by pulling the Plastic vent at the rear
of the door jamb. The speakers are probably discontinued Blaupunkt,s and may
only be found at your dealer. They are pricey at approx $100 USD. You might
find a good used one. If you replace just one side with a different brand of
speaker you may notice a different sound and a little unbalanced tonal
quality. If you're considering upgrading there are some nice boston
acoustics 4 x 6's that would do nicely. CX97e I  think. There are of course
endless choices when it comes to speaker combinations and a person could
just forget about those in that panel alltogether. Sorry i ran so long!!

Bye for now,  Todd
