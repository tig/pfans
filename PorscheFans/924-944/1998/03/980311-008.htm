I have a large shopping list, so I'll try to be terse.

1. I have been told that the power window regulators for the 924 and 944
type cars is the same. Is this true? If so, does anyone have a good
driver's side regulator for sale. I don't need the motor, just the
mechanism.

2. Can someone recommend an experienced mechanic in the Providence -
Warwick RI area to work on my 79 924. Neither the local dealer (Inskip)
or the one shop I know of (German Motors) is interested in doing the
work. (I'm not looking for freebies, I will pay to have the work done.)

3. Does anyone know what the part numbers are for the two different 924
cylinder heads? I understand that the change was only in the size of the
intake valves from 38 to 40mm. Is that true? Would the earlier head
still fit a 79 engine?

4. If the head has the valves installed and the camshaft bolted in could
I reasonably assume that the valves had been set or would this have to
be done after installation of the head.

5. I'm not going to get rid of the 924, but I am getting interested in a
928. I notice that the prices seem higher. Is that a function of rarity
or just because it is a more complex car with a higher starting price?

TIA for any help. I really need this stuff!
