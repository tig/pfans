I have been following the thread re brighter bulbs with interest 
as I have found my bulbs not as bright as I would expect them to be.

I have enquired in the UK at two Porsche franchises and this is what I 
was
told.

1.  "We do not recommend them as we have found they can cause the socket 
to

get very hot and has been known to melt the wiring insulation on the
socket".

2.  In the UK it is apparently illegal to use the higher bulbs.

If that is the case I am surprised the shops are allowed to sell them!.

One other point I understand in the UK Sunday papers that a case was
recently thrown out of court
re a Snooper / radar detector as "it did not interfere with the radio
emissions"..."as such did not
break the law"
