>evsenter=40shaka asks: would removing pan be benificial?<<


 Howdy there,

Before you go tearing down the front of the engine it would be VERY helpful=
 to remove the=20

underpan, as you may be experiencing the same Problem I had until yesterday=
=21=21  I found out

the change in weather had played havoc on my lower Radiator hose, allowing =
it to strech and

allow a small stream of coolant to leak after the car was warm.=20

HINT: If it doesn't leak until the car is warm this could be your problem a=
s a bad pump

would leak regardless. Spend a few minutes replacing the hose about 30 min =
to bleed the=20

system, it's not that bad. Beats the Heck out of replacing the pump and fin=
ding out thats=20

not it.


hope it helps.
