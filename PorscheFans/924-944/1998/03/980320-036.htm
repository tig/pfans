I'm glad your experience/experiment with the tires & dealer worked out.
However the last/only time I dealt with Big-O, they ruined my Momo rims.  After
being assured by the manager that he personally would mount my tires with great
care, I left & came back 2 hours later.  When I returned, I noticed that one of
the other employees was finishing-up on my car.  The big problem was that I
didn't scrutinize the result before leaving the shop.  When I got home, I
noticed that the lips of all the rims were scratched by the mounting machine
(nope, they used the good machine with the arm, not the standard one).  In the 
end, the manager did NOT take responsibility for the screw-up.  I know, I'm 
partly responsible for this situation as well.  Rich, I think part of your
great experience with Big-O came from your relationship with the owner - & I
don't mean to offend you in any way.
