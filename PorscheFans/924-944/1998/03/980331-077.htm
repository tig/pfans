David,

It sounds to me as if you need to bleed your clutch and possibly 
replace the master and/or slave cylinders (easier said than done).  My 
951 had the same problem when I bought it last fall, although mine only 
stuck down for about the last 1" of travel and only stuck sometimes.  The 
first thing you'll need is a patient friend who will put up with your 
frustration and cursing while you wonder how hard it can be to bleed a 
*@$%ing clutch (thanks again, Brian).  The first thing we did was replace 
the slave cylinder, because it looked pretty bad on the outside (rusty, 
etc.; about $47).  We then proceded to bleed the clutch and got fresh 
fluid through the system, but it still didn't come all the way up (it was 
actually quite a bit worse than when we started).  My friend had replaced 
the slave in his '85 1/2 944 and had the same problem of it not coming 
all the way up, and was advised to leave the clutch pedal up overnight 
and the rest of the air would work its way out (no, I don't understand it 
either, but it worked for him, but not for me).  We then noticed that the 
master cylinder was leaking some fluid on the inside of the firewall, so 
I replaced that also (about $66 and a real pain in the butt to get to the 
mounting bolts, and getting the fluid line back in is a real test of 
patience).  We then continued to bleed the clutch in the usual way, but 
still couldn't get a good feel.  We tried a Mity-Vac to bleed out the 
fluid, but that only seemed to get more air in the system.  Brian asked 
his mechanic for more advice, and he suggested that I pump the pedal up 
and down, but only pushing down as far as the soft part of the travel, 
and then pulling it back up.  I did this several hundred times over the 
course of several days, but it still wasn't right.  We then bled it some 
more the usual way, and got it back to about where it was when we 
started.  After driving the car for several weeks this year, one morning 
it stopped hanging up and had a great, firm feel.  I guess the vibration, 
heat, use, etc. of driving the car worked out the rest of the air.  I 
haven't had it hang up since.

Good luck, you'll need it.  If anyone has better advice, I'd like to hear 
about it in case I need to travel this road of German engineering Hell 
again.

For the past two days, this has been happening to me.  When I'm driving,
I'll push in the clutch, shift gears, lift my foot from the pedal, but
the thing only comes up about a third of the way.  I have to stick my
foot underneath the pedal pull it up.  Once I put pressure on the clutch
pedal from behind, it'll will pop right up to normal position.  Any
ideas about what's going on?  If this has happened to any of you, what
was the financial damage?
