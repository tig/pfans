Been there, bought the 'T' shirt, cussed.
Whenever you open the doors or the tailgate you can hear a relay
operate. I have no idea what it is for but it sure drains the battery a
treat. It may be something to do with the factory alarm (if that is
standard in your part of the world). If you want to flatten your battery
even quicker put the ignition switch to the first position to enable you
to hear the radio. This is particularly successful as even more mystery
relays operate and the heater fan operates as well!
(PS if you need to keep the tailgate open simply remove the wire with
the 1/4" spade connector from the base of the right-hand window strut.)

If you only use the car occasionally like I do you will soon note that
the battery will also be flat after garaging for about 2 weeks. This is
with the doors closed and the alarm off. Believe me there is nothing
more frustrating than psyching yourself up for a real good blast than to
turn the door key and hear nothing!
I did some simple current drain measurements and if I remember correctly
there is about 50 - 100ma being taken all the time. I know the radio
memory takes some but not all of this. Well, even this small load will
eventually drain your battery especially if it is old/not fully charged
in the first place.
I believe you can buy a 'trickle' battery charger for the purpose but
being tight I simply found a small (1.2VA) 12V transformer, bridge
rectified the output and added a smoothing capacitor. Now, theoretically
the output voltage is too high (12 x 1.414 -(.6 x 2)) but because the
output current is way too low for the job the thing simply saturates and
gives about 100ma which keeps the battery nicely in its previous state
of charge. There is no way it will charge the battery.
Only snag is that I need to either connect the gadget directly to the
battery (in the boot/trunk in my case) which is a pain, or use a
cigarette lighter plug which is what I do but I prefer to leave the door
on the first catch to avoid damage to the cable or door rubber.
I guess this second part has nothing to do with your problem but I
thought I would share it anyway!
