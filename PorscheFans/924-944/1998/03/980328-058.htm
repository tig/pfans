Hi,

>The daily entries to the digest are fast approaching 100 and it is
>getting harder and harder to sift thru the info.

You have a few choices:

- Unsubscribe from the list.
- Do nothing and leave it the way it is.
- Get off the (lame) digest and get on the one message at a time method,
which makes it far easier to keep the stuff you want and get rid of the
junk.  You do this by sending a message to subscribe@porschefans.com and
putting one line in the subject:

join 924-944

You will then be switched from Digest to Non-digest mode.

>racing exploits/setups.

>Why not use racing@porschefans.com instead. This is very underutilised
>(approx 15 entries per day).

The reason a lot of the competition messages come to this list is for =
just
the reason you said, the Racing list is under utilized.  If someone has a
question about competition with their 924/944/968 the best place to get
the answer is right here because that's where the knowledge base is.

>Perhaps it should be renamed competition@Porschefans.com.

Not a bad idea.

And I don't really give a rat's ass about 924s or early 944s, but a lot =
of
the messages are devoted to those cars too.  I don't mind, I just hit the
"Delete" key.
