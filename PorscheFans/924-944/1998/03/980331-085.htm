All-

Adding to the confusion on the issue of timing belt replacement....

A friend owned a 1987 Porsche 944 S which he had the poor luck of breaking
the timing belt on.  The subsequent valve/piston introduction was more than
he cared to deal with, so he decided to rid himself of the car.  I bought
it from him for the sum of $1000 (A relative bargain, as aside from the
head damage, the car is in good condition).  I purchased the Porsche
Workshop manuals, a used cylinder head (another story in itself) and other
assorted parts. 

The head replacement was a bit difficult (the used head supplied to me was
cracked from top to bottom through the chain tensioner port), but
eventually I got it all sorted out.  I replaced the timing belt, the
balance shaft belt, the alternator belt, and the power steering pump belt
while I was at it.  The important thing to take awy from this is that the
PORSCHE MANUAL DOES NOT STATE THAT YOU SHOULD USE THE TENSIONING TOOL FOR
THE TIMING BELT ON 1987 AND LATER 944 S MODELS. It says to use the tool on
the balance shaft belt.  

For reasons of time and money, I chose not to use the tool at all (I do not
own one).  This is a personal decision, and I am prepared for the
consequences.  The way I figure it, the timing belt is tensioned by the
spring tensioner, and should not be too far off.  Checking by hand it felt
right to me.  I also tensioned the balance shaft belt by feel, reasoning
that a failure there is not catastrophic, just resulting in a lot of
vibration.

Should you do what I did?  Maybe.  Depends on your personality, your
experience, and you wallet.  Pay your money and take your pick.

P.S.  If you do not own the manuals, buy them.  They are the best $200 I
spent on this car.  I used them to do the belt (I cannot see how you could
do it without the manual), as well as the sunroof, the tailgate, etc...
