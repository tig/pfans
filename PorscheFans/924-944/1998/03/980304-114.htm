Hey Brian:

Welcome to a small but avid fraternity.  To be perfectly honest, I chose the
S2 over a turbo because I didn't want to spend a ton on engine mods, like you
can with a Turbo.  Plus I wanted to auto-x the car, and the S2 is better for
that due to its low end torque (and before you turbo guys start your flames
going, I have two words for you:  Bill Buetow).

Here's a few things I have done.  For better throttle response, try relocating
the pivot ball on the throttle linkage arm up about a half inch.  You'll need
to get a new pivot ball (try an auto parts store), drill the linkage arm, and
attach the new ball.  Adjust the cable, and you'll get much more immediate
resonse whe you hit the gas.  Also about 70 more horsepower (just kidding!)

For a little better breathing, try cutting holes in the airbox with a circular
saw.  I used about a 2", I think, and cut three or four holes.  It makes a
much nicer intake roar now.  Might even be faster, I don't know.

There's always chips, but I haven't tried any.  I may do a dyno test of the
various one this spring, and if I do, I'll post the rsults on the list.

My next steps will be a Quaife and Turbo Cup forged wheels with R1's then some
more suspension stuff.  These won't make it faster in a straight line, but if
I wanted that, I'd have stuck with my 5.0 Mustang bracket racer.

The S2 is a great car.  You'll love it.

Terry Thomas

<<Am currently trying to decide where to begin in terms of engine
modifications/upgrades, I have noticed a huge selection of parts for the 951
and 944 but not very much for the S2, any suggestions would be very helpful.
As well as any experiences you may have had with the products.>>
