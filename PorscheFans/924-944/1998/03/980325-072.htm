Well we got the boost controller working with the stock wastegate but I
still have a problem.
The minimum I can boost is 1.15 bar.  I would like to be able to dial it
down to about .7-.8 bar.
Before I installed the MFS I could get .75 bar with no restriction.  Now
with the MFS and no
restriction I get .95 bar and after running the wastegate line through
the GReddy control unit I
am up to 1.15 bar.  Today is hot, about 80 deg, so when it turns cold
again I will be boosting
1.3 bar minimum.  Is there a way to adjust the wastegate so that it
opens with less pressure or
do I have to go with a two port aftermarket gate.  Has anyone ever used
a turbonetecs wastegate?
They are much more reasonably priced than the GReddy, HKS or PowerHaus
product but will
they perform as well?  Thanks to those who responded to my post
yesterday, it was very helpful.
