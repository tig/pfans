P-Fans,

A few weeks ago on the Racing list I noticed a post regarding Cryogenic
Treatment of brake rotors. It arroused my curiosity so I spoke with Jeff
Stone at Kelly Moss Racing about it. They have used the treatment to extend
rotor life and found a 2-3 fold increase in rotor life without any downside.
Sounded good to me, but I was curious...  I wanted to know what is Cryogenic
Treatment. Well, here's what I've learned from a most interesting web site:
http://www.pacific-cryo.com/index.html#about . Here are a few exerpts from
there site to whet your appetite....

Cryogenic tempering is a dry single treatment process producing permanent
results for a wide range of products.  Material is subjected to a subzero
temperature ( -310oF) followed by a triple heat tempering in a computer
controlled environment.  This is a relatively new engineering field.  Our
objective is to provide industry with a controlled, dry, cryogenic process
that will produce considerably longer wear life for almost any tool or
dynamic part subject to wear and abrasion.

Advantages of Cryogenic tempering on materials are:
stress relief - change in density - increased durability - dimensional
stabilization - improved wear resistance & tensile strength - closes grain
structure of ferrous metals - increased lubricity and part stabilization -
controls wear by producing a tough surface - stress relieves alloys and
aluminum for tighter tolerance machining.

Frequently treated materials are alloys of steel, copper alloys, aluminum
and magnesium.

American Machinist, May 1996, page 140 said:
"This all-aluminum Chevrolet short-block V-8 racing engine saw an increased
life-span of 500% after a            cryogenic treatment. The treatment
included the engine block, crankshaft, rods, pistons, piston rings, piston
pins, bearings, heads, intake, camshaft, push rods, rocker arms, valve
springs, valves, and lifters."


Item for Cryogenic Test                  Before Cryo      After Cryo
Ratio
    Race Cam/Drag                             12 Runs           49 Runs
4.9
    Aluminum Race Heads/Drag        10 Runs           27 Runs         2.7
    Ring/Pinion High-Perf/Drag            8 Runs           22 Runs
2.75

Cost for treatment, about $6 per pound!!

If you're interested in more information, just check out the web page
referenced above. This is just one of many facilities around the country
which now offer this service. I am in no way associated with this company or
any other in this business and really have no first hand experience with it.
I found it interesting and though some of you might also.
