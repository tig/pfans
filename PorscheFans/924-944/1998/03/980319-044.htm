I never heard back from the guy who wanted to know about good porsche shops
in the bay area so I'll post to the list. I used a shop called CT
automotive when I first got my 951, but I noticed a few discrepancies in
the info they gave me on waterpumpers(they specialize in 911's) The I found
Brian at Precision Performance in Campbell(408-374-0944) and I will never
go anywhere else. He was a dealer mechanic for 15 years and was the
waterpumper specialist at the dealer when our cars first came out. He owns
his own shop so he takes his reputation seriously. I've had many repairs
done there and havnt had a single complaint. I referred 3 others to himn
and they all agree he's the best. Repairs are usually done within a couple
of days and he doesnt try to pad jobs or suggest more than you need.
