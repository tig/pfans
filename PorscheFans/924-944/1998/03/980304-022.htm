In answer to the Tweeks and Vulgarity, I'm not surprised at all,
actually the most vulgar thing about Tweeks is their prices.  If you
look at the ads in Pano or Excellence you will see prices that beat the
heck out of  
Tweeks.  Also if you have a problem with an Excellence advertiser, the
magazine will try to arbitrate.  They are good people, give them a try.

In responce to the question about cookie cutter wheels, I use them in
road racing (SCCA and PCA) and they work fine.  I'm not sure about the
weight, but they feel about the same as Fuchs.  The $420 sounds a little
high, unless the tires are almost new.  The last set of cookie cutters I
bought were 7 inches and cost $250 for the set.  That would make the
tires worth $170.  I'd offer around $300 and dicker from there.  Bottom
line though, the wheels are fine.
