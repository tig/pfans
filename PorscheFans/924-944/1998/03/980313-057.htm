Hello Keith,
=09George B is right, it could be a bad check valve (screws into the fuel=
 pump=0Aunder the car) and allowing/bleeding down the  residual fuel pres=
sure. The=0Acheck valve, is part #944-608-951-00, $8. Or you could have a=
 leaking injector=0Aallowing the same thing to happen. Test the fuel pres=
sure at the fuel rail, by=0Acracking loose the end/cap-nut at the end of =
the fuel rail. Its towards the=0Afront of the car. Fuel should spray out =
when you crack it. If it does not it=0Ais either a leaking check valve or=
 injector. You can then try pinching off the=0Areturn line either under t=
he car or on top of the gas tank. If that does=0Anothing, pull the fuel r=
ail and injectors and test for leaks there. Don=92t=0Aforget to renew the=
 injector seals. 

  =09There  could be a chance that the CO% mixture is off. Usually the en=
gine=0Astarts up on the second try because the computer enriches the fuel=
 mixture by=0A10% every time the engine does not start. i.e.: if you try =
twice to crank over=0Athe car the fuel mixture will be 10% higher than th=
e initial first try/crank. 

Good Luck
