With the imminent purchase of my second 944 I called my Allstate agent
to talk about rates. While I have always considered my premiums
ridiculously high, I have not had the time or resources to research
alternatives.

Allstate tells me that the 944 is pegged as a "high performance"
automobile so they cannot extend their regular rates to me. So they
wrote me a non-standard policy with nearly double the premiums of a
regular policy, in the $1000/6 months range. While I can understand the
951 or the S2 classified "high-performance" my '84 944 puts out 150
horses and less torque. A Dodge Neon is higher performance. Strangely
enough, the 924 and the 914/6 are the only P-cars not considered "high
performance" by Allstate.

Adding the S2 to my policy will get me a slight break but I find it
ridiculous that I will be shelling out close to $3200 -- the BB value of
my '84 944 -- every year to Allstate. This with the '84 classified as a
"weekends only" car. I am under 25 but I have a perfect driving record
and no comprehensive claims ever. Can list members with similar profiles
let me know if this sounds like a standard rate? Any suggestions for
other insurance companies? TIA.
