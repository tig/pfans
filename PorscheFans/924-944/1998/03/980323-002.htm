Good to hear you are alive and kickin' too.

As for the Yugo, I was forced to give it up when, try as I might, I was unable
to secure the wide wheel kit (you know, the ones that stick way out past the
fenders), with the ultra high performance, 10" diameter, 5" wide, chrome
polished rims.

It seems that they are not available in the 3 lug nut hole pattern.
