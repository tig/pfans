The way to stop the singing of the Pagid oranges is to use the Porsche 
vibration dampers.  I don't have the part numbers at hand but, depending on 
your car, the numbers should be in the archives as I have posted them 
previously.  I use the Pagid oranges on my 93 968 and hated the singing 
they produced.  The dampers took them down to literally nothing.
