You're not raining on my parade... more likely Pacific NW Region PCA.
After going through this DE I have to agree it left a lot to be desired.
The whole day should have been dedicated to the 1st time drivers, not
intermixed with all the other run groups.  That would allowed plenty of
time for one-on-one instruction.  However, I'm sure that would have also
raised the price considerably.  In my particular case I felt safe enough
due to my years of driving experience, however I know that others =
probably
didn't feel too good about the situation.  Just following along behind
another car could easily have been intimidating for some people.

In retrospect I have to agree.  I don't think I should have been allowed
to go blasting around the track by myself during the last session.  The
instructor should have been along and/or there should probably have been =
a
reasonable speed limit imposed for new drivers until they can actually
_demonstrate_ competency at speed, which certainly wasn't done in my =
case.

Now, if you think my situation was bad.  Consider this.  My 20 year old
son was also allowed to drive by himself the last session... and he was
driving his chipped 951S!  Believe me, I was glad he made it to the end =
of
the day without any problems because the potential was certainly there.
=46ortunately, we both drove well within our limits (at least I did, =
don't
really know about my son).

I may look into Portland and see what they have down there at PIR.

I guess this discussion should have moved to the Racing list, but I still
feel it has relevancy here.
