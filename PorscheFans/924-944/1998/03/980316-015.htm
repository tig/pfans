Further to my recent e-mail to Randy on the captioned, here is the
formula as taken from pp. 67 and 69 of the April 1998 issue of
European Car.  Thought you might find it of interest...

          Flow Rate = (HP * BSFC) / (#Injectors * Maxcycle)

Flow Rate is in pounds per hour of gasoline
HP is projected hp of the ENGINE
BSFC is Brake Specific Fuel Consumption in pounds per horsepower-hour,
generally .4 to .6 (possible higher) at full throttle.  Start with .45
for NA engines, .55 for 951s.
#Injectors, 'nuff said.
Maxcycle is the maximum duty cycle of the injector, figure .8 (80%)
for a typical OEM E.C.U.  Above this, the injectors might begin to
overheat, which can cause it to lose consistency - or even fail
completely!!

Let's take a stock 1986 951 as an example.

  Flow rate = (217 * .55) / (4 * .8)
  Flow rate = 37.3 pound injectors required

And at 90% injector efficiency, the injector required is 33.2 pounds.

To convert pounds per hour to cc/min:
  1.  Divide by 60, giving pounds per minute.
  2.  Divide this by 6, giving gallons per minute.
  3.  Multiply this by 3.785, giving liters per minute.
  4.  Multiply by 1000, giving cc's per minute.

Now let's say you've modified your car and need to know how big an
injector to use (to run safely at 80% efficiency), simply revise the
equation as follows:

  HP = (Flow Rate * #Injectors * Maxcycle) / BSFC

I figure you might find this of interest (and some debate as David
Reins at PH is running over 400hp with stock injectors!!)

I think the stock injectors are 36 pds/hr.  Can anyone confirm this?
