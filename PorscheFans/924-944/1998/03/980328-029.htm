>The Life Story of Professor Dr. "Ferry" Porsche
>
>Although the company of Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG was formed on April 25,
>1931 as "designers and consultants for land, sea and air vehicles", it was
>Professor Dr. Ferry Porsche, son of the automotive genius Professor
>Ferdinand Porsche, who steered the company into becoming one of the world's
>leading automotive engineering design companies and specialist manufacturer
>of sports cars. From the time he designed the first Porsche, the Type 356
>in 1948, it was his personal involvement that made Porsche the great marque
>it is today.
>
>When Ferdinand Anton Ernst Porsche, known as "Ferry", was born in Wiener
>Neustadt, Austria, on September 19, 1909, his father was Technical Director
>of the Austro-Daimler Company.
>
>Never far away from the automotive work of his father, Ferry Porsche was
>soon behind the wheel of a car and, by the age of twelve, was even
>permitted to run in the class winning Targa Florio car, the lightweight
>Austro-Daimler Sascha.
>
>When the Porsche family moved to Stuttgart in 1923 for Professor Ferdinand
>Porsche to become the Technical Director of Daimler-Benz, the south German
>automotive center became Ferry Porsche's second home. It is there that he
>was educated and met his wife, Dorothea. She remained his staunch companion
>until her death in 1985, and was the mother of his four sons.
>
>Ferry Porsche started working with his father when the latter formed his
>independent design office. Their first contract, designated number 007 to
>give the impression it was not their first project, was a 2-liter car for
>Wanderer. The success of this car was later to lead the newly founded Auto
>Union Company, which had incorporated Wanderer, to appoint Professor
>Porsche as the designer of a new Grand Prix car to meet the new 750 kgs.
>maximum weight formula.
>
>The Auto Union was the most advanced pre-war racing car design concept. It
>was of lightweight construction, featured a 16-cylinder super-charged
>engine, with unique valve control mounted just behind the driver; an engine
>position which is standard for all modern generation F1 cars. Ferry Porsche
>played no small part in its design and construction. Less well known is the
>fact Ferry Porsche conducted much of the initial test driving of the car
>until his father declared one day, "I have enough drivers, but only one
>son."
>
>One other car which the Porsche firm designed before World War II was to
>have an important influence on both Ferry Porsche and the rest of the
>world. It was, of course, the most produced car of all time: the Volkswagen
>Beetle.
>
>The war itself cut deep into the life of the young automobile designer.
>Transferred from demolished Stuttgart to the Carinthian town of Gmund in
>1943, Ferry Porsche and a few colleagues had to start again from scratch in
>1945 by keeping busy with repair jobs and the construction of simple farm
>machinery.
>
>Meanwhile, the French held Ferry's father, Professor Ferdinand Porsche
>until 1947, when Ferry Porsche's family managed to raise sufficient money
>from new contacts in Italy to buy his freedom. One of these design projects
>resulted in the Cisitalia Formula 1 race car, unveiled at the Turin Motor
>Show that same year. It was the first race car with a mid-mounted engine
>and four-wheel drive.
>
>After that, Ferry Porsche decided to build his own sports car, effectively
>the first "Porsche". He took out plans he made back in 1939 for a light,
>compact car based on the Volkswagen, practically the only components
>available in Germany at the time. Besides providing speedy acceleration,
>unmatched braking and good road holding, an essential criterion was the car
>had to be practical for everyday use. Its "marketing concept" adopted by
>Ferry Porsche was, "If I build a car that gives me satisfaction, then there
>must be others with the same sort of dreams who would be prepared to buy
>such a car."
>
>The first car to bear the Porsche name, the Type 356, was delivered on June
>8, 1948. It boasted a tubular space frame chassis, an aluminum body and a
>rear-mounted four-cylinder 1,131 cc VW engine. The following year, in order
>to ensure continued production of the 356, Ferry Porsche negotiated a new
>contract with the then head of Volkswagen, Heinz Nordoff, for the supply of
>parts. Besides this, the contract appointed Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche K.G.
>as consultant engineers to VW, sole importer of VW's for Austria and
>recipient of a royalty sum on every VW Beetle produced at Wolfsburg.
>
>A total of fifty-two 356 cars were built at Gmund in Austria before the
>company returned to Stuttgart. Production recommenced there in March 1950.
>During the same year, Porsche began designing its own engine, the Carrera.
>The 356 model which was initially forecast to have a world sales potential
>of 500 units, was last produced in 1965 after over 78,000 cars had been
>built. The policy of model longevity is continued today with the Porsche
>911, which enters its 35th year of production.
>
>Professor Dr. Ferry Porsche was happy and grateful that his father
>witnessed with approval, shortly before he died on January 30, 1951, the
>start of Porsche as a specialist sports car manufacturer. Since 1948,
>decades of hard, dedicated work were put in by him to further enhance the
>Porsche product, which enjoyed a fine reputation from the beginning, by
>expanding customer service and marketing, not to mention accelerating
>product development through motor racing.
>
>Since entering Le Mans in 1951 and achieving a class win, the name Porsche
>has been synonymous with success in motor sport. Amongst its numerous
>triumphs, Porsche has been crowned World Endurance Champion in sports car
>racing 14 times and, since 1970, has won the Le Mans 24 hour race a record
>15 times. The world famous Monte Carlo rally was won four times by Porsche
>911s, and an experimental 4WD 911 Carrera won the 1984 Paris-Dakar desert
>race first time out, the very first sports car ever to achieve this honor.
>Subsequently in 1986, Porsche 959s finished first, second and sixth on
>their debut outing in the event as well as becoming the first all-wheel
>drive racing car to enter and win its class at Le Mans.
>
>In all, Professor Dr. Ferry Porsche demanded a great deal from his
>engineers, mechanics and drivers. He made courageous investments in new
>developments and thereby founded the worldwide reputation of his firm as a
>privately controlled, independent producer of technologically advanced
>sports and racing cars for worldwide use.
>
>In 1972, the year the Porsche family withdrew from active management of the
>company, Weissach was opened. Today, Weissach is world famous as a site for
>research and development, where 30% of all work is undertaken on behalf of
>other manufacturers, governments and NATO.
>
>Back in 1965, Ferry Porsche was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the
>Technical University of Vienna in recognition of his achievements in so
>many branches of the automoble world. In 1984 on his 75th birthday he was
>awarded the honorary title of "Professor".
