I fully agree!  Any ones Hp claims should be taken with a grain of salt!!!

Hello P-Fans

	I dis-agree here!!!  First, my car (a 951) without a cat still passes the
tail pipe sniffer test! Most cats after 50K(just look at the federal emission
warranty!) miles do not work at all, or are partially clogged by that mileage.
The reason I chose to uncork my exhaust was not for the meager 5-10 hp gain,
but for the increased throttle response!  More boost sooner, better throttle
response, and as a side benefit, cooler underhood temps.

	 I feel that I am a responsible person. And my personal feelings are if we
want to clean up the air we all breath, we should start at the big polluters
like that big chemical plant or oil refinery that has NO scrubbers at all, but
that buys up old clunker cars for federal emission credits so THEY do not have
to start cleaning up their own smoke stack polluting chimneys!  OK, I will
step down from my soap box now. Thanks.

just my $0.02....
