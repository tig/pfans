    I'm running 90/130 watt H4's ( I forget the brand ) and have neve=
r been
hassled, or ever blinked at on low beam. H4's have such a flat low pa=
ttern
on low beam that they are often more polite than DOT spec headlights =
no
matter what bulb your using. This is especially true in car where the
headlights are close to the ground. However on high beam the person
recieving the "brights" may still see spots the next morning when he =
wakes
up!!!! Don't give anybody the brights unless they truly deserve it
