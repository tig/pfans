	Not a flame, Mike. Just picking up on your thought. Perhaps
instead of
	complaining about the number of messages/day, we should be
pleased to be
	part of a group that enjoys participating.  I usually don't have
time to
	read all the posts, but I appreciate the diversity.  I suppose
we could
	institute some formal prefixes for our posts to warn off members
that are
	not interested.  But this would probably get cumbersome.  My
opinion is
	that we simply have different reasons and interests for posting,
and these
	vary over time for each individual. Personally, sometimes I want
info, very
	occasionally I provide useful information, and sometimes I'm
guilty of
	posting just to break the tedium at work.  My own way of
reducing the
	number of PFan posts/day is to reply personally to someone if I
think I
	have relevant information that may not be of interest or useful
to the
	group at large.  A lot of us do this.

	I think we operate, for better or for worse (Better, I think.),
in the mode
	of "Click and Clack" (Car Talk on NPR, on the off-chance that
someone's
	never heard them). Some joking around, irrelevant tangents and
personal
	opinions, but we have the resources to eventually provide
someone w/ the
	answer.  How about "J" for joking around, "I" for irrelevant
tangent, etc.,
	etc. ?

	IMHO.
