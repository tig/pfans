There have been a lot of discussions recently about hydraulic system
bleeding (frequency, fluid types, bleeding techniques and equipment, brakes
vs clutch, etc.).  These discussions bring to mind a maintenance strategy
that I have entertained for some time, but have never heard discussed in
the past. Here it is:

Everyone agrees that regular bleeding is good (less fluid boiling, lower
corrosion in the system)and more frequently is better.  At the same time,
bleeding is a bit of a pain (messy, risk paint damage, need a partner
and/or need equipment, risk doing a poor job and getting air into the
system, etc.)so we are always seeking a better way (one-person equipment,
colored fluid, etc.).  How about this logic:  Brake fluid absorbs moisture.
 From where does this moisture come?  It must come from only opening in the
system  ....the breather hole in cap of the master cylinder reservoir
(placed there so that as the brake pads wear, air can replace the
additional fluid that is needed to push the pads out a bit further).  So,
it would not be a good idea to plug this hole.  So, all the moisture comes
through this hole and is absorbed into the fluid that is in the reservoir.
Now, as has been pointed out, the fluid in the system is quite "stagnant"
(i.e., it "moves", but does not "flow" between the various components).  So
how does the moisture get from the surface layer of the reservoir to the
rest of the system where it can cause damage?  It diffuses.  How quickly?
I do not know.  But it would seem to me that if one were to simply change
the fluid in the reservoir (turkey baster method), one would be getting out
most of the moisture molecules. (Remember that not only is the water
content highest in the fluid in the reservoir, but the greatest volume of
fluid is in the reservoir.) So simply changing this fluid would remove most
of the moisture.  Furthermore, once the fluid in the reservoir had no
moisture, guess what?  Any moisture that earlier diffused into the other
parts of the system would now diffuse back into the reservoir, where the
moisture concentration is now lower.  Now I would not suggest this logic
for track situations, where boiling is an issue and where it is the
moisture in the distant parts of the system (calipers) that is most likely
to heat and boil. But for everyday street cars, where the choice is between
every year or two (or never!) to do the "correct job" versus every 6 months
to do the 2 minute "turkey baster" method what do you think is better?  Or
what if you need to pay a dealer for the full job (and question whether is
done right) versus doing the "turkey baster" method that anyone can quickly
and more frequently do.  And then spend that saved time tearing up the
corners on a weekend.
