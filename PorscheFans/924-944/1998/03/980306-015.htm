Ah, Kentucky!  I love the place ( graduated from Berea College, KY and
have been back to KY many times).  I-64 going east from around the area of
the Hoosier National Forest in IN and to Louisville is great driving.
Wide, smooth roads with inclines and banked curves, great place to drive
fast and no police.  Once I took my stock 944S to KY, at 100mph going
uphill on top gear the darn thing had just "woken up".  The acceleration
from 100 was truly impressive. 

I-75 south from Lexington usually has too much traffic to be fun.  If you
feel adventurous, route US 25 to Berea (via Clay's Ferry) is much
prettier, especially in spring.  Stop at Boone Tavern in Berea for some
good spoon bread.  Next stop is the A&W in Corbin for some root beer
floats.  

Never had to worry about police except when around Louisville and Northern
Kenticky (by Cincinatti).

Obligatory Porsche content.  The enjoyment of all of the above can be
significantly enhanced by driving a Porsche.  I hope my 951 will be able
to visit KY soon.
