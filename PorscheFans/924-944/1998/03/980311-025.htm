Jad, I agree with you on the brainwash being perpetrated by Jiffy Lube and
the like.  Some convincing data was published by Consumer Reports about 1
year ago in which they studied a fleet of 60 NYC taxis relative to engine
wear and oil type/oil change intervals.  The engines were all torn down and
mic'ed (critical areas measured) when new and then re-assembled.  One group
used conventional oil (Valvoline I think) and 3K change intervals while
another used the same oil type but 6 or 7K intervals.  Another group used
6K intervals w/synthetic oil.  After 60K miles of taxi service, the engines
were torn down and re-measured.  Conclusion?  There was no statistically
significant difference in wear in any of the several categories studied
(i.e. bearing journals, cylinders, cams, etc.).  The only aspect of real
world driving that was not well represented in the study was cold starts as
the taxis rarely are shut down long enough to get cold.  I believe this is
one area where a synthetic offers a real advantage (since it stays thinner
and pumps easier than dino oil at low temperatures), especially if you live
in the 'cold north' and drive your car in the winter.  I'm sorry that I
can't remember what the exact date of this issue was but I'm sure it can be
found at your local library.  It's interesting reading and the conclusions
are not reached via anecdote as is so often the case with this subject.
