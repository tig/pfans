<< He took a look into my Porsche one afternoon and declares
 that putting a turbo in it isn't all that difficult.  He says without
 the knock sensor of the 951 you'd have to limit your boost and only pick
 up about 50% hp, which is not up to 951 specs, and would  cost about
 $3000.  He offered to use my car as a test bed and complete the system,
 but I'm not sure there would be any interest in it...since a 951 can be
 had for about $2000 plus my car (better brakes, yada yada yada...shut up
 951 guys).  So there it is...if anyone thinks such a system would be
 worthwhile....let me know. >>

Absolutely!  But, for an S2 engine.....can it be done???  The one powerhaus
claims for the S2 puts the power up to TT capability, but for $18K!!!!!

If he can do it for a S2 engine, than I'm sure he would have A LOT of
attention from the S2 and 968 family!!!!

Let me know!
