This email was dropped during the great outage of '98. Since I am the
self-appointed safety nazi these days...

I'm gonna have to call you 'teach' from now on. ;-)

Good point. But since we are talking aboutr Newtonian physics my mass
doesn't really change much. ;-)

This is exactly how they are typically used and why they are so unsafe
in 944s. The angle my Weltmeister bar makes with the rear seat belt
mounting points is actually greater than 90 degrees! And this is the
typical mounting scenario for both the Weltmeister and the Brey-Krause
bars. The other alternative is to run the harnesses back into the rear
compartment. Unless you get fancy with metal cables such as Henry Hoeh
has, this will result in the harness being too long and it will stretch
too much to do any good.

This is my real concern. They are simply not safe for anything but
autocrossing. And both the Weltmeister and the Brey-Krause harness bars
are illegal for SCCA Solo II because they do not telescope.
