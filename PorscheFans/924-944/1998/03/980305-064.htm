Hey Lenny, 
I think you are right that Carbs won't be the right stuff for that 
engine, but i would be a High Performance Fuel Injection with fit's to 
45 DCOE Manifolds. This one is really performing great and is using all 
the nice stuff like Knocksensoring, Lambdasond etc. 

So even when i'm wrong with it, i have to try it. Again i'm looking for 
Manifolds which 'could' add 45 DCOE Webers to a 2.5 Litre 944 Engine.

Thanks for you email,

Daniel
