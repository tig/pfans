George (and anyone else on the list who may have a clue),

I know you specialize in 944s, but how about their long-lost brethren, the 924?

I've been waiting for two weeks for my local dealer to obtain some information 
from PCNA about the compatability of the 1979 924 Turbo tranny (european) with
the one on my 1980 924 Turbo (US).  It seems this is a Porsche "Tech Line" 
question that the PCNA Customer Commitment folks refuse to deal with.  
They told me that only dealers have access to the PCNA Technical Info folks.
Having found no success so far, I'm hoping you might know the answer.

Both year models have the 5-speed units with the "racer" shift pattern.  I've
seen these transaxles described as type 016/Z and as type G31/02.  I suspect
these are two designations for the same tranny, but I'm not sure.  I want to
swap both the tranny and tube.  Are they identical, or will I end up having to
swap other things too?  There are rumors flying that the bell housing on the
1979 model (behind the engine) might be unique.  I'm not worried about 
differences in the tube-to-tranny junction, but the front end of the tube and
possibly the shift linkage and the half shafts.

Thanks in advance.
