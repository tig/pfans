Hi P-fans!

I have a question about this dreaded oil pressure sensor.
It appears that mine has gone bad, starting with a flashing oil
pressure light when the car is getting warm. Oil pressure on the
gauge is perfect and acting like normal.
Of course I have checked the oil level several times and it is
exactly on the top mark.
After getting worse every day it now seems to get sensitive against
shacking, even if the car is cold and I hit a hard bump the light
is flashing. Tapping with a screw driver works also.

I never experienced anything like that with all my cars I had be-
fore, is this sensor a typical problem for a 944?
I think there are only two german manufacturers of oil pressure
sensors, VDO and Motometer, does anybody know which brand it is?

Thanks in advance
	klaus
