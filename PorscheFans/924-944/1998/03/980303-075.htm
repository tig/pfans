Hello All;

I spent the past weekend chasing down an oil leak at the front of the
motor, replacing the distributor cap and rotor along the way.  It
appears that the leak is coming from behind the cam sprocket, leaking
into the belt cover and down over the top of the water pump.   When it
came to removing the cam sprocket and belt I chickened out fearing doing
more harm than good.  PLus I do not have any of the tools necessary to
retension the belts.

I assume the cause of the leak is a bad cam seal.  Does this sound
right?  I had the cam tower resealed and new belts installed about 1.5
years and 10K miles ago.  Car is an '89 Turbo with 71K miles.  I am
planning to take it to my mechanic and let him fix the leak.  Is there
anything else I should have him do while he is in there?  Any comments
appreciated.
