When I bought my first 944, I called my Farmer's agent for a quote.  He
informed me that had I qualified for the good driving discount, my
coverage would be $1,600/yr (full coverage, 28YO male, San Diego), but
since I didn't, it would cost $2,000/yr!  Given that I had a perfect
driving record and my only claim was for a stolen car (which is why I
bought the 944 in the first place), I asked why I no longer qualified
for the discount.  He answered, "You own a Porsche.  Porsche owners
aren't eligible for the Good Driver's Discount."  I thought he was
joking -- he wasn't.  I have been with USAA ever since.
