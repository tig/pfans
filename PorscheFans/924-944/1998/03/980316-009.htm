 Howdy all,
Well, the fuss of moving out/in is almost over. Boxes everywhere!
Anyway While I was parked infront of work last night fixing
yet another Network problem (this time a m-wave link)
it would seem that some local kids decided they were too bored,
and figured they would shoot at cars!  Yup I won, Little $hits!
The car actually got lucky: a small hole in the front spoiler,
a chip in the paint on my drivers headlight, and a hole in the
passengers fog-light.  I dont think the spoiler or headlight
will be tough to fix, but are the fog-lights on an early 85 a 
whole unit, or does it have a replaceable mini-bulb inside?
They appear to be the original Hella's. Im going to crawl under
it tonight to look from the backside of the light to see if I can
tell.  Just looking for advanced warning:-)

TIA Nick Miller
P.S. it would appear that BB guns too have advanced over the 
years, as I remember mine was lucky to punch through both 
sides of a Coke can! Now they can go right through my Spoiler.
