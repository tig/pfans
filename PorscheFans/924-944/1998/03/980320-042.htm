Well, in the interest of costs, I'd recommend you replace both mounts at
the same time to save money on the labor of having to do it twice.  The
mounts aren't that expensive, but make sure you get the right type for
your car.  I think there are a couple different designs (solid vs.
gel-filled), so I assume you'd want to get your hands on the latest
updated parts.  Sorry I can't help with your UK shopping.

As Mr. Haynes says, "replacement is the reverse of removal."
"War doesn't determine who's right, just who's left."


How annoying the pleasure of driving my Porsche is being blurred by
terrible
vibration particularly on tick over or slow speeds. It looks as if it
must be
the offside hydraulic mount. Should I replace both or in the interests
of
costs can I get away with just one. Does anybody know of a go, cheap
source of
this part in the UK.
