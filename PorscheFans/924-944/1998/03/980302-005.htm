Thought you guys would find this interesting.  A friend with a DSM
(Eclipse/Talon) sent this to me the other day to harass me (in good
fun).  It was a post on the DSM list:

Hi all

Just got in a little scuffle with a Porsche 944 and since I'm still a
little excited I felt like  telling everyone. On my way home tonight
Ispotted
a nice red 944 with some nice wide after market wheels and a fat
exhausttip,
so I pulled up behind him at a stoplight I could see he was looking
backin
his mirrior (probably just wanted to check out  a REAL car) so I
gotready to
launch just incase.Well ,Boom, the light turns green and I see his
rearend
squat down while his tailpipe spit out a little black smoke. Here we go!
hoo
ha! Well by the time I got to second gear my tires started spinning
(gotta
love the Fwd's) but the noise is kinda cool,so I let off just enough to
get
alittle traction and almost ended up in his trunk.So I jump in the right
lane
and it felt like he was bearly movin (the deadly 3rd gear) as I pass him
I
look over and give him a big toothy grin,and just kinda moved infront of
him
so he could look at my 4" tailpipe as the lanes go back to just one. You
just
have to love our cars.  Hey does this make me a Porsche killer too?

Oh yeah nothing broke today
