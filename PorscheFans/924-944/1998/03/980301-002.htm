I have a '87 944 Turbo that has started acting up.
Yesterday the turbo was boosting until I stopped to fill up. When =
restarted the power was way down, and the turbo gauge was showing just =
over 1.2 bar. I decided I'd leave it until this am. When I checked the =
fuses and connections, everything seemed o.k . I took the car for a =
short drive, and the power was back and the boost pressure was 1.7- 1.8.
Within a couple of miles though the problem recurred.
Anyone have ideas?=20
