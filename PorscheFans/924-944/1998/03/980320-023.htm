I have a 968, so this may not apply to the 944, but I've had that same
whine ever since I bought the car (with 41K miles). I just got back from
the local Porsche dealer (for a state sefety/emissions inspection), and
I asked about the whine. He tells me that my '93 968 has a "bigger cam
belt" than the 944's, and that the noise is actually an indication that
the belts are at the right tension.

When I posed this question to the list a few weeks ago, a couple of
folks replied that their engine made the same noise, and their mechanics
has also dismissed this as "normal".

I still plan to have my balance/cam belts replaced @ 45K. though.
