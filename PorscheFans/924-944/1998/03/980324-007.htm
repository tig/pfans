Clark,

What I don't understand is what is different about the Porsche system.  It
seems every new car out there is running timing belts and Porsche is the
only manufacturer (that I know of) that is insisting on a tension tool.
Even VW rabbits, which are probally using thae same manufacturer of belts,
uses no tool.  I do agree with the fact that changing them often prevents
insane wallet draining if failure occours though.  Just think about it,
there is a driven cog wheel on the crank, a couple of idler/tension pullys,
cam cog wheel, and H20 pump wheel.  What is so special about that?

I apologize for my ranting on my previous post, but I see it too often on
the Porsche list and at local gatherings the shear arrogant remarks about
some peoples maintenance techniques.  At one SCCA auto - x I witnessed an
older 944T owner give the third degree to a younger 914 owner about buying
bearings at a local bearing house instead of getting OEM stuff from the
dealer.  That is just one thing I saw, and I get a little defensive about
it (or is that offensive?).  So consider this an apology to any I offended
with my post.
