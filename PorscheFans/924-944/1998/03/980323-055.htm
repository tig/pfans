     I just picked up my car after on-car balancing the front wheels.  
     Below are comments:
     
     1.  I think it fixed my shimmy!  I drove about 5 miles on the freeway
         and the steering wheel was solid and the car tracked well.  
     
     2.  First the wheels were dynamically balanced as usual.  Then the 
         on-car balance was performed.  They added 1/4 oz. to my right
         and 1/2 oz. to my left wheel.  They spun it over 100 MPH to check
         balance.
     
     3.  It cost $25/wheel.
     
     4.  The place is Custom Alignment in Mountain View CA.  650 961-5311
         'Bob' appears to be the owner and everybody seems to know him in
         Porsche circles.
     
     I'll post again after some more miles to see if the shimmy stays away.
     
     You know when you hit your 'sweet spot' on your steering and it felt 
     that way so i have high hopes. 
     
     Custom Alignment was a very clean shop with friendly competent people. 
     The technician told me that he sees more 911 balancing refugees than 
     944s.
