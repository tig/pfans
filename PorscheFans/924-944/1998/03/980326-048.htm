Hi P-fans,

        I have been having a boost issue since I replaced my motor
mounts. During the motor mount change I thought the wastegate hose was
pulled off at the timing valve. It now turns out that it had broken on
the PO. After the motor mount fix and replacing the timing valve I
drove the car and it had some boost at least over .4 bar excess but
did not have the kick it used to have. When this first occurred I went
thru the turbo manual to determine where the problem could be.
Everything seemed to work except for the sealing of the intake test
13. My oil trap was leaking at the top cover and at the lower gasket.
I then took on the job of replacing the oil trap. This involved
removing the turbo and associated hardware, not that hard, but not
that easy. Since I had the turbo out I deside to rebuild. It had 85k
miles on it. Last weekend I put all hardware back. I drove the car and
it still did not feel right. The boost gauge (dash) does go over 1.4
and get to 1.7 but I have to at full throttle. I checked the blink
code,nothing shows up, no blinking. Today I drove one of my friends 87
951, now I know there is something still wrong. I anyone has any
information, I could sure use it. This weekend I will check all test
point again. Also since I had one heck of a time getting the mounts to
line up, could I have destroyed something. 

Another question as I installed all the hardware I was checking
sealing. I got to the point where the turbo was in place. I connect
the air source. Air was escaping thru the turbo oil section to the
exhaust side out the muffler. Now the oil was not pumped up at this
time so the turbo was dry, but is this normal. Thanks for the help
