I don't want to get to deep into this one. But if your really talking
"RACING". I have seen NOone around any form of racing that would tell you
anything. If he did it probley wasn't the truth. These guys that make the
living building racing engines have torque values with different gasket
combo that would keep you up nights if you acutual knew what spec they were
using. In Sprint car racing most of the racing engines cost above $35,000 a
piece. The builders want $3000 to rebuild them, try and do it yourself. They
have ground off all mfg markes, used different studs, and so on. In Indy
racing you rent the engines with the understanding you will not remove
either the head or the sump. Back when we were doing sport car racing the
engine spec's and tire were both top secret. Not even members of the crew
knew what was going on in these areas. I would imagine it would be much the
same in class racing. RACING IS RACING the tuners know this and the winning
engine bulders get the highest prices and the most customers.
