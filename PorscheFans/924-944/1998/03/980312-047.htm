Oil comparison should be done so that one compares apples to apples. 
Viscosity-wise, the synthetic is not thinner than the conventional oil at
the rated temperatures, ie the viscosity of new 5W-30 conventional oil
should be the same as that of new 5W-30 synthetic.  As for the 0W-30, I am
not an oil authority, neither do I have my owner's manual here, but it
seems like it has no place in a 944 engine (especially one that probably
runs 15W-50 in the summer).

Do notice that the 5W refers to viscocity at 32 F (I think, that can be
verified at the oil WWW sites easily).  The pour point (temperature at
which oil still flows to a specific degree, again defined at the WWW
sites) of synthetics tends to be much lower than the pour point of a
conventional oil with the same rating.  In the very same way the synthetic
oil flows to the oil pan, it also pump back to the engine when the motor
is started.  In comparison, the conventional oil often will be thicker and
not get pumped to the engine as fast.  Thus, at 20 F, a conventional oil
may actuall flow like molasses do and take a long time to get pumped up to
the engine, leading to increased wear and increased wear during the first
minutes of engine operation. 

Mike, you may also wanted to check out the Mobil 1 FAQ, Mike, the RedLine
FAQ has some info, too. They explain these concepts better than I did.  If
you do not know where they are, check www.starnet.net/~menelaos/cars.html,
I have links for them there.

No flames intended, of course.
