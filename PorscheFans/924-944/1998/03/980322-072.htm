I would be very dubious about NOT using The Tool on a 16 valve head.  The=
re
are just too few of them available if you make a mistake.  Also, the Turb=
o
head is not a cheap item either.

Some people have a better sense about tensioning than others.  As an
example,
I can "feel" the torque on a fastener as I tighten it down very well. =

Conversely, I still use a torque wrench on critical fasteners.  Others ma=
y
not
have this sense about correct tensioning.

While it is true that The Porsche Tool can only really get you into the
ball
park, it is a good investment for those who can not afford the
consequences. =

I recommend following the procedure by the book.

Marv lives!  We thought you had bailed and went over to the Yugo camp.

I have to agree with Dave, Marv and the others who said to use the "tool"=
=2E =

Larry (the original poster) also stated he had 40 years experience with
racing engines.  He can, no doubt, adjust the belts by feel and do it
correctly.  My engine builder is the same way, he also has the years of
experience and can do things by feel.  I have seen him slide a piston int=
o
a cylinder he has been honing, announce it is at .003, measure it with th=
e
bore micrometer and it is .003.  The rest of us mere mortals should use t=
he
"tool" so we can sleep nights.
