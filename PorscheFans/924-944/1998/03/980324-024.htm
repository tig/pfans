I'm not sure about your Toyota, but my Mazda had a replacement cycle of 60K
miles for the timing belt.  The issue is not the quality of Porsche belts
versus other belts.  With the cam belt properly tensioned and not
contaminated with oil, it may last 60K miles - but not on my car.  The
issue is what happens if and when a timing belt breaks.  In many cars, it
is merely inconvenient.  In 944, it is catastrophic.  A frequency of 30K
mile belt changes not only helps ensure that the belts don't break, but
that other vital components can be evaluated for possible replacement (e.g.
gears, oil seals, etc.)  All of the timing belts I've replaced, from all of
the cars I've owned, each one looked virtually new.  That doesn't mean that
one would not have failed with the next use.

In case any of you are wondering, my wife and I have logged over 100K (2
cars) on belts I tensioned by feel.  But, if you think I am advocating
tensioning this way, you would be wrong.  I plan on purchasing the tool
soon.  As recently pointed out,  caution always has you erring on the side
of slightly too tight, undoubtedly reducing the service life of other
related components.  Over several years the cost is comparable or less than
other items purchased for your car, such as stereos or set of wheels.
Besides, since the tensioning tool retains nearly all of it's value used,
you can recover nearly all of its value selling it when you sell your car.

In the final analysis, the P9201 is expensive, but is the most precise way
to accomplish the task.  Regardless whether one agrees with Porsche's logic
in engine timing  design or not, the tool provides and accurate way of
setting belt tension consistently, each and every time.  Over time, it is
(nearly) impossible for anyone to match that accuracy by feel.  I can judge
distance very well, but if precision where important, I would pale in
comparison to someone using a tape measure. You can tension the belt by
feel adequately, but not precisely.

Who would have thought that a circular piece of rubber would inspire so
much passion?
