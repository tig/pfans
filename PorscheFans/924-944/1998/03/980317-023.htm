Wow, I received a LARGE response for information on polishing Porsche wheels.
As such, I am posting this info to the list. Please excuse the length. My 
experience is with 15" 5-spoke Fuchs, but this information should apply to 
just about any Aluminum wheel.

  If the center of your wheels are painted and don't need to be re-painted, 
and you only want to polish the outer lip of your wheels, you don't need to 
strip the paint from the center of your wheels. You will need to be careful 
not to remove the paint with the buffing wheels. However, you will need to 
strip any clear coat or paint on all sections that are to be polished.

  Stripping paint from wheels doesn't take a lot of time with the proper 
solvents (Automotive Paint thinner, Acetone, etc..). I use paper towels to 
apply solvent to the paint and let it soak in for a few seconds, then rub  the 
paint off with the paper towel. I highly recommend doing this outdoors as the 
fumes are really nasty! I have a really thick pair of black rubber gloves that 
held up to the solvent, disposable gloves don't work. Once the wheels are 
stripped, you can evaluate the condition of the surfaces. You will be able to 
remove scratches and minor damage, but if you have any deep grooves or nicks, 
I don't think they can be fixed at home. However, polishing will make any 
wheel look better, even if there are a few deeper grooves or dings.

  The next step once you have bare metal is to use buffing compounds and 
buffing wheels to first cut and then polish the surface of your wheels. For 
most wheels, the outer lip can be polished, or the complete wheel can be 
polished. For information on buffing compounds and buffing wheels, check out: 
http://www.caswellplating.com

They have a booklet you can print with information on buffing. You will also 
need a motor to spin the buffing wheels. I started with my 1/2 hp grinder
motor, but it kept overheating. I am now using my 2.5 hp radial saw with all 
guards removed. The ideal setup would be a motor driving a flex shaft, you 
need to spin at ~3000RPM. That way, you don't have to hold a heavy motor while 
working. The catalogs suggest that drills may also work with an adapter, but 
you may ruin your drill in the process.. The basic idea is to start with a 
rough compound, and then finer compounds as the surface is polished smooth.  
There are different buffing wheels for each stage, and separate buffing wheels 
need to be used for each compound. The compounds are suspended in blocks of 
wax, and is applied against the spinning buffing wheel. The trick to buffing 
is not to use a lot of pressure. If your buffing wheel is falling apart, you 
are using too much pressure. If you are not polishing or cutting quickly 
enough, your motor is either spinning too slowly, or you are not using a rough 
enough buffing compound. Read the booklet mentioned previously for more info..

  Once the desired shine has been achieved (in my case,mirror/chrome look), 
you will need to protect your nicely finished surfaces. The buffing compounds 
leave a waxy surface that will need to be cleaned. DO NOT use paper towels on 
bare polished Al, it WILL scratch the surface. I use cotton flannel rags sold 
for waxing cars. The cleaner the surface the better your paint and clear coat 
will stick, so clean it many times with solvents and clean rags.

 Painting the center of the 5-spoke fuchs with semi-glossy black isn't all 
that difficult. Use thin layers of paint. If you have the patience, you could 
let each layer dry completely and sand with fine sandpaper in-between coats. I 
would suggest applying several coats (with drying time in between), then 
lightly sand, then apply a final coat or two. I haven't applied the clear coat 
yet, I will let all of you know how that goes.

  It will probably take 15->20hours to re-finish four wheels if you have all 
of the correct supplies. It may go faster if your wheels are in good shape and 
need a minimum of polishing.

You should also check out http://www.eastwoodco.com/ , but their prices on 
buffing compounds are not all that good as they come in wimpy little tubes vs.
the huge blocks from caswell. I bought my clear coat from EastWood.

Good Luck everyone! Let me know if there are any questions

Ezra
