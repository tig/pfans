<< Has anyone used suspension parts sold and/or manufactured by Ground
 Control?  I'm particularly interested in their adjustable camber/caster
 strut plates, the height adjustment sleeves that fit over the struts, and
 double-adjustable shocks.   >>

Nick,

I installed that setup, except my shocks are not double adjustable, a couple
of months ago.  This weekend will be my first drivers ed in a year, and will
be able to comment better then.  To date, I like it.  It allows me to corner
balance the car which I may do before this weekend.  With this setup, you
don't need a spring compressor to disassemble the strut/spring unit (? Is that
how you state that, or does "strut" imply the strut/spring unit?)  Turn in is
improved. I just installed bigger swaybars as well.  I can't wait to testdrive
those!

PS:  Cost was $500 for springs, colars, and camberplates.
