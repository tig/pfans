I for one will be sorry to see you go. I don't think the people that
responded to you represent the generally good natured people on this list,
nor do I think you should be compelled to resign for what that bunch said.
To me and probably others, the benefit of this list is the large number of
diverse discussions that occur. I'm not interested in all of them, but I'm
glad they are occuring.

I do think a system of coding messages would help, but I also recognize the
difficulty in doing that. Suggestions?

Mike
