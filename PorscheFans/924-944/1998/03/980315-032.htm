My 89 951 has a drive line vibration around 3000rpm. All belts are
correctly installed and tensioned. The vibes can be felt in the shifter and
slightly in the clutch pedal when it is depressed. Everyone who has driven
the car thinks it is in the drive line and is not an engine vibration. Also
my climate control has started to cycle continuously from hot to cold. When
the air is heating up I can hear a "click" around the glove box. Then the
air will cool off. Afew seconds later the heating begins. If the AC is on
you can hear the air flow sound change as if you were pressing the recirc
button in and out. A local shop did some trouble shooting with Porsche
proceedures and they said it was the interior temp sensor which is around
$300 new. Any suggestions is greatly appreciated
