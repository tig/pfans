Rilly boring day at work so it's storytime:  

I have several '44 buddies in town who enjoy doing the 'honkytonk
scramble' about once a month.  We meet at a bar, have a beer, and
decide where we race to for the next beer.  Loser buys.  Tuesday night
we had two early 944's, a turbo, and an S2 dishing out danger.  After
3 scrambles the other early '44 went home broke from buying all the
beer so far.  The S2 owner is an excellent driver so we knew the next
stop was between me and the turbo and the way my car was running I
knew this was my chance.  We all three pulled out of the RiverRock
Cafe onto a three lane one-way street and lined up in each lane at a
red light.  Motors revving, there was a 1/2 mile drag race to the one
lane freeway entrance ramp ahead.  I glance in my rear view and see a
police cruiser pull out of a side street and approach us from behind. 
The S2 driver notices also.  He immediately turns on his left blinker,
I turn on my right, and the turbo does a redline burnout right in
front of joe cop.  I immediately went to get his wife so we could get
his car before the wrecker showed up then went and paid his $1000
bail.  He concedes to being the loser, his 9-month pregnant wife
offered me a great deal on an '87 951.
