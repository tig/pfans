It seems to me that the underlying issue here is the level of risk one is
willing to accept.  The basic cam belt drive engineering involved is not
much different than many other OHC motors out there.  Do you feel
confident/lucky enough to tension the cam belt by feel on an interference
motor with very expensive parts?  If so, congratulations: you save yourself
a cool $400 for a silly, single purpose tool.  If you lose this gamble, you
shell out roughly 5 times more to have the local Porsche shop fix it. 
Personally, I have used the tool on my car for the last 140K miles, change
my belts every 30K and have never had any problems.  I'm not convinced this
would have been the case had I used the 'feel' technique.  One data point;
for what it's worth.  You pays your money; you takes your chances.......
