Dear P-Fans:

I was driving my car the other day on a Bright Sunny day and the temp was
abot 20 degrees F.  I got to my destination and raised the hood as I
smelled anti-freeze.  There was no big leak but water vapor coming from
the top of the engine. Not at the bleed plug.  I was hard to pin point
but I think that it was coming from (as you are looking at the engin from
the front) the right side of the engine.   Under what I call the
"fingers", I dont know the technical term.

I would not have seen this except it was so cold and I could see the
vapor. Any other day it is not visible, but it can be smelled.  It is not
strong but you can tell there is anti-freeze in the air.  Anyway does
this signal trouble or is this normal for a car this old.

Thanks for the help!
