Jorge, Kwan,
  We have three 924's with three different "cool down"
routines... because of different thermostats/thermofan switches, 
and the two-fan air-conditioning fan set-ups. One of the cars
(with air conditioning '78) insists on cooling after it's shut
down with BOTH fans (this car was originally from the desert, so the PO 
had both the fans wired to run together, on
OR off), the Turbo switches to one fan at
a slower speed, the '79 NA does the same.
  I found that running any of the cars for one fan cycle 
before turning it off solves the problem of 
worrying about the fans running on and possibly
running down the battery. I do this on the Turbo normally, so just
started doing it to the others and I haven't had any hard start problems.
  I don't think these cars have a "timer", just heat sensors.
