Well fellow Porsche fans, I must once again post that I have sinned. In that
I once again put my unholy, shade tree hands into the most holy of holies
the Porsche car. I know I said I would change but the devil took me at a
moment of weakness. I had the Porsche dealers book open, the phone was in my
hand. I knew I should call the purist at Porsche and order that windshield
washer motor. But NO the devil took me there as I stood and made me put my
unsantified hands in and tear out that windshild washer motor and tear it
down and fix it myself. If you are interested, here is what I found. Once
you get the motor from the car you will notice that the leads are marked +
and -. Hook a battary up to these leads, if you can hear (and feel) the
motor turning, you have a chance to fix it. If the motor does not spin, make
the call, it's dead. But if it does spin, unhook it and remove the 4 small
bolts, this will seperate the 3 main components. Look up inside the motor
you should see the U shaped device, this fits around the white wheel you see
on the mating part. Turn the wheel, is it free?? Seperate the white housing
from the metal plate and you will see the two gears. Lightly sand the brass
plate shinny, lightly sand the brass gear, including the cogs. WD-40 them
and put them back togather. I can't believe Porsche would spend so much
money making windshield washers like this. These things are made better than
the whole Yugo car. They are made to be rebuild. Well I hope this helps
someone out there. Oh ya I read all the msg's you guy's post, there all
interesting to me. As far as getting flamed I have nomex underwear on and
the only thing that really burns my ass is a flame about 3 feet high. Have a
good day.
