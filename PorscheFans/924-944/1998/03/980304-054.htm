well here is my story since my car is a forever project i might as 
well contribute in some manner-

there is a spot in the road on IH-35 in texas where it splits, one 
way to dallas one to ft worth...it is about 3:30 a.m. and i am in my 
new (to me) 944, shiny red paint, stupid college kid (owned the car 
for 1 week about this time, had slicks actually)...i am cruisng along 
at about 90+ when i decided that the next 40miles may be better spent 
exploring the limits of my car...besides it is so late that no one 
else is out and if i lose control i only kill myself....so i press 
the gas, at first slowly, then more hard....the speedometer kicks 
past 115, then 120, then 130...so now i am a little frightened that 
some one somewhere might spot me in my boyish exhuberance...well that 
though goes out the window as the speedo reads 135....now i am just 
cruising along, listening to the exhaust (straight pipe to 
supertrapp, louder than hell)...i get a ways down the road and all of 
a sudden here come the red&blues....i am thinking how the hell is he 
gonna catch up, well not being as stupid as the first half of the 
story would have you believe i pulled over for him and turned on my 
flashers to let him know i was not going anywhere....well the z-28 
interceptor pulls up and billy bob gets out, he comes to the window 
gun drawn and i toss the keys out on the ground...he is actually 
quite polite...
"son do you know how fast you were going?"

"yes sir, about 130"  ......he replies"the trooper who clocked you 
had it at closer to 138" (well now i am suitablly impressed with the 
cars performance, because 1) 138, whoa shit and 2) they had to call 
ahead because the other Z could not catch me!!)  

so i give the story about how i had only had it for a week and how i 
was going to my friend's house and i was tired and i thought it would 
be a good time to try it all out...his response it whats under the 
hood (i am thinking yes he is not going to take me to jail just a 
huge ticket)  long story short....he thought it was a cool car and 
was impressed that a 4-cyl would go that fast, not to mention he said 
he hadnt has as much fun chasing a car ever before nor met such a 
polite person who should be going to jail!  he let me go and asked me 
to slow down to under 100 and gave me an escort all the way to 
Dallas!!

thank god that every once in a while police cannot be bothered with 
paperwork!!!
