To all:

    I can't believe my ears .. my body man just called me today and relayed
a problem he was having with Tweeks .. He order my stoneguards and rear
decale for my 944 .. (it's being repainted) From Tweeks over 1 and a half
ago.... when he called to see what happened to his order.. they told him
they hadn't gotten to it yet .. when he told them that he needed this part
ASAP because he needed to deliver the car to me .. and he deserved to have
it sent 2nd day instead of ground .. they told him no way .. when he
insisted that they accomadate him because it was THEIR mistake .. a Mr.
Wicker told him to F... Off and they didn't need his business and hung up on
him!!! .. I can't believe it!!! .. THis is not a professional way to operate
... I have to tell you ... I WOULD NEVER BUY A PART FROM THEM AGAIN!! ..
