I recently purchased a Porsche 944.  It lacks service records so I am goi=
ng
to take care of the routine PM items before something expensive happens. =

First, the timing belt must be changed.  Is there a reasonable alternativ=
e
to using the P9201 tool to set the timing belt tension?    I checked with=

our local German auto repair agencies and only the Porsche dealer uses th=
e
tool; the rest simply go by feel.  Second, low RPM vibration (under 1500)=

suggests that one or more engine mounts need to be replaced, any
suggestions?  Third, since I don't know what type of antifreeze is in the=

car, I may change it.  That is if the phosphate free thing is truly a
requirement.  I talked with our internal antifreeze chemist (The company =
I
work for produces an antifreeze corrosion inhibitor as a minor product.)
who tells me that phosphates and silicates are added to prevent aluminum
corrosion in high temperature cavitation areas (like water pumps).    The=

new permanent antifreeze products use organic acid inhibitors; they are
phosphate, silicate, and borax free.  These products did not exist when t=
he
car was built, so I am left perplexed.  Why would Porsche recommend again=
st
the corrosion inhibitor, phosphate?

Thanks
