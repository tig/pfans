The red stud is the lightest part of the hub assembly.  Given the wheel +
lugs + lock was not balanced on the car, (just the wheel by itself on
the machine) the idea is to have the installed wheel balance well on the
hub.

There was an alternate method for locating the lug where the lock should
be installed.  I do not remember it, so someone else will have to help
out.  What I do know is that even after a new control arm, an alignment,
new Dunlop D40 M2s installed (balanced and the rest) and with the lock and
valve stem installed as supposed, I still got a very slight steering wheel
wobble around 65mph on my 944S with phone dials and stock lugs and lock.
It was perceptible only when I took my hands off the steering wheel. It
was nothing like what I had before I replaced the tires and balanced the
wheels (some tape weights had fallen off), but it was still there.  The
worst was when I took off the wheels to clean them after buying the car
and installed them so that the lock and valve positions were totally
random.  I was getting low frequency rumbling noises from all four corners
(which went away immediately after I put the locks and the valve stems
where I should have) and front-end shimmy at a wider speed range.

In comparison, my current 951 has MOMO wheels of the wrong offset, no
wheel locks and NO shimmy at any speed I have driven the car at.  Do not
ask me why this is the case. 

Like you said, try an on-car balance, but you may have to live with some
small amount of this.
