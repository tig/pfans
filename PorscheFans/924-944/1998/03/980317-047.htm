Frederick,

My car is an 87, so your sunroof may be different, in which case this
message will be of no value to you.  I also used to experience no sunroof
action on key position one, but my hinges would also not stop properly
when lowering the sunroof on key position two.  It turned out that the two
microswitches by the sunroof motor were totally out of adjustment(OK, so
the screws holding them in place were totally loose :-) ). 

Here is something you may want to try:

Open your owner's manual and check the section about turning the sunroof
motor manually.  That will show you the area where you need to be working. 
Once you peel the carpet, you will probably find a plastic piece that
covers the sunroof motor assembly.  This plastic piece was held in place
in my car by four gold colored screws.  Remove that plastic piece. 

If the assembly is like the one in my car, you should be able to see close
to the motor two microswitches next to each other.  The switches are
operated by a big plastic piece driven by the motor.  Take a look and see
if all the cables are plugged in correctly (my car has stickers with
schematic diagrams showing the connections per key positions in that
area). Also check the microswitches for proper continuity.  Also, check if
the nuts and bolts keeping the microswitches in place are loose. I used
blue Loctite for the two adjusting nuts.  You may need an assistant to
operate the console switch if your sunroof malfunction is due to the
microswitches being out of adjustment.  I believe the fore and aft
adjustment sets where the arms stop retracting when lowering the sunroof
(position two). 

From start to finish it took me less than one hour.
