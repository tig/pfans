Getting fresh coolant in the car, especially since you do not know how
long it has been in there is a good move!  Coolant should be replaced
every two years.  

As for the phosphate and silicate free issue, check out the owner's
manual.  I cannot remember the exact words, but they are very clear that
phosphate-free antifreeze should be used.  Trust them, they built the car,
they know a few things.  The VW, Audi & Porsche dealers use the Autobahn
brand, it is the factory fill.  If you find it too expensive, Prestone
makes a phosphate-free (that happens to also be silicate-free antifreeze
in a silver bottle that sells for less than half of what Autobahn costs.
Do not even bother looking at the Sierra stuff, it is #@%^*.
