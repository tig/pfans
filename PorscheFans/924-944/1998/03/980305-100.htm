Hmm. I sent out a response earlier today backtracking a bit on this point,
but it seems to have not made it to the list (The problems of using strange
mailers to answer mail at work <cough><cough>.)

In any case, I admit I don't know enough about the fluid dynamics involved
to quantify how much the rpm required to cavitate would be raised if, say,
the static oil level was raised 1 cm.

I based my logic on an analogy to water pumps. I relate everything to do
with fooling around with engines back to drag racing small blocks :-) In a
Chev or Ford small block, the water pumps cavitate at high rpm. It doesn't
matter how much coolant there is, at high rpm they cavitate, leading to
large local hot spots, leading to bad things. The solution there is to
either redesign the water pump or slow it down relative to engine rpm
(underdrive). What I forgot (I think) in making my analogy was that the
coolant being pumped is at constant pressure, set by the rad cap.
