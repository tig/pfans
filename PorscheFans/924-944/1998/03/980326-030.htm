Tom Pultz and P-Fans,

As we've heard, there are alot of different approaches taken at DE's around
the country and alot of different opinions regarding the "right" approach.
It has made for interesting reading so you definately raised a question of
interest to many.

I just hope all the debate doesn't cooled your enthusiasm for DE's.

My own .02 is DE's ARE a great opportunity to get to know your car better by
exploring it's limits in a controlled environment which is FAR safer than
public roads. This can be really valuable when trying to assess areas for
making improvements in the car. It MIGHT also be a chance to become a better
driver. "Might" is the key -- don't assume you will find "quality
instruction" when dealing with volunteers. That doesn't mean you CAN'T find
a good instructor, it's just that it shouldn't be expected.

If someone is very serious about their driving, a professional school would
be far better than DE's. As you move down the "serious" scale, you might
find DE's volunteer instructors provide a great source of solid advice. You
might try a number of different instructors to help find one that you're
comfortable with.

Most significantly, though, is what YOU bring to the party -- are you taking
a critical approach and striving for improvement, or just out to throw the
thing around and have a good time going fast. Nothing wrong with either
approach, it's just a question of goals.

I think your idea of going to different tracks is always good because it
gives variety to your track driving experience, allows you to see how other
regions run their events, and to learn from different instructors.

I wouldn't be too concerned about the approach taken during your first
event -- even though it might not have been the BEST approach. The biggest
concern I would have is being put into an experience I felt was unsafe. I
would walk away from an event and that organization if there were NO
controlls being placed on unsafe drivers, they allowed passing anywhere on
the track, or other things which would put ME or my car at risk. If I ever
experience that sort of thing, I would simply exit the track, pack up my
stuff and demand a refund!

You were there, you know how you felt about it at the time, and you are the
only one who can made a valid judgement on that DE experience. Maybe the dry
land guy said 45 mph but did 70 seem unsafe? That's  your judgement call.
It's great to hear other's opinions and about experiences other P-Fans have
had in their regions -- those are valuable. My main point is to urge you to
NOT let those opinions too strongly influence your decision about
participating in other events.

Like most things, what you get out of a DE event is most directly determined
by what YOU put into it.

Thanks for bringing up an interesting topic... we may not have heard the
last word even yet!!
