All,

Yesterday afternoon, I started my car (87 951) and found that I could
not turn the steering wheel.  There were some metal sounds and the
wheels were not turning.  I tried a couple of times and then the
wheels starting turning and the sounds went away.  I shut off the car
and popped the hood.  The power steering fluid reservoir had bubbles
in the fluid, but was still just above the low mark.  I went ahead and
topped it off and the problem went away.  Also, my car, after just
being aligned last week is back to wondering all over the road.  I
have replaced every part of the front suspension/steering in the last
year except for the upper strut bearings/mounts(?) and the rack
itself.

My question is, is there a new (rebuilt) steering rack in my immediate
future?

Thanks,
Clark
