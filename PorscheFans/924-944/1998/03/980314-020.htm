Hey Everyone,

For anyone who suspects that their O2 sensor is bad and causing hesitation,
rough low speed cruising, and intermittent power like I experienced with my
944S, read on.

I Just got back from a high speed, high G romp through some backroads and
wanted to share my good news regarding my O2 sensor woes.

In my previous submits, I was wondering about the O2 sensor for my 1988 944S
from the dealership for $224 versus the Bosch #13913 I picked up at my local
Napa store for $48.99. Turns out the one the dealer says if for 1987-88 924S
and 944S (part number 0-258-003-011) is the same sensor as the Bosch retail
one (part number 13913). The difference is in the length of the wire(s) and
the type of connector.

I first took my old sensor out of the car and bench tested both the new and
old one using instructions I found at
http://www.cyberauto.com/info/o2sensor.htm. The new Bosch one performed
exactly how the information said it should. My old one did not. Very slow
response, and it never got above .3 volts, even when glowing red hot,
whereas the new one went to 1.15 volts in 18 seconds. The first thing I
notices was how little effort was required to remove my old sensor from its
flange, and then that there was a little bit of corrosion on the threads.
Also I noticed that the bulb of the old sensor was clean and white/grey, but
most of the slots in the bulb were closed with corrosion.

So, I took a small steel wire brush the size of a toothbrush and cleaned the
sensors threads and the bulb slots. Then, I took a pocket knife blade and
made sure the slots were clearly open exactly like the new Bosch one. I then
cleaned the contacts in the connector and the male prod inside the connector
was roughed up with a tiny piece of aluminum-oxide sandpaper. I also noticed
that the male part of the connector had a little slit in the end. I took the
pocket knife blade and spread it open just a tad so it would get a good
connection with its corresponding mate still under the hood. I repeated the
bench test. To my GREAT surprise, my old sensor performed EXACTLY like the
new Bosch one. I then did the "2-minute" test as the instructions describe
and it performed perfectly. I repeated all the tests 10 times just to be
sure. That baby was glowing red!!

I noticed that when I removed the new ones plastic protective cover, there
was anti-seize on the threads. So, I put anti-seize on the newly cleaned
threads of my old one and reinstalled it. I tightened it securely then did
the pocket knife trick on the male parts of the connector end that was still
under the hood. I put dielectric grease on the connector, plugged it back
in... then... I fired her up.

After letting it warm up like I always do, I took off. I drove easy until
reaching operating temperature... and they the tach needle went SouthEast
(as it so easily does in a 944S). And again and again and again. It ran
perfectly! I lugged it up hills in 5th, and everything in between. No more
hesitation or stumbling. I easily reached 130mph on a long country backroad
that I could only ever get to 120mph on before (no one was around of
course).

So, I put the new Bosch sensor back into the box untouched and promptly
returned it for a refund.  $$$$ WooHoo!!!

I have 88000 miles on my 944S and likewise on the old sensor. I would
recommend this experiment to anyone before shelling out the dough for a new
one, especially if they want to kick out the $200+ for the factory one
instead of splicing wires on your old connector.

I was so happy with the results, I thought there HAD to be someone out there
who was experiencing the same symptoms as I was. If anyone has any questions
I would love to help out.
