I think there are about 1790 people here who will agree, 
that drinking and driving is just plain f**king stupid

19 and drinking (also walking or crawling)

You can count me in on that one.  My wife works in a regional trauma center
and often comes home with the blood of some innocent victim on her as the
result of a drunk driver.  Many time the drunk is on the gurney right next
to the person they hurt! Guess who get first priority,  well ya it is who
ever is hurt worse but there are times the forget the morphine (as if they
need it).  We have a reward here in Iowa for people who drink and drive. 
Come on by sometime and I will be happy to see you get it.
