Hi,

A few days ago I posted a note regarding the use of 18" 993 Technology
wheels on a 951 as my son was considering some.  While they may indeed =
fit
if you get the ones designed for the narrow body cars, everyone should be
advised that according to factory Technical Bulletin #9305 of April 15,
1993 "Retrofitting of 18" wheels on Porsche vehicles which do no have 18"
wheels as original equipment is NOT ALLOWED (bold and underlined!).

The factory says that endurance tests have shown that equipping certain
Porsche vehicles with 18" wheels in an application not already approved =
by
Porsche Cars, N.A. may result in loosened bolts and/or threaded
connections on the front wheel carriers.  This, in turn, may cause
fractures in these components.  Fractures may also occur in the front
strut mounts and in the body in the area of the rear suspension as a
result of the installation of 18" wheels.

Such damage can occur without warning.

This bulletin applied to ALL models of cars.

Also of interest is Technical Bulletin #9303, September 28, 1993, which
deals with the fitting of 17" wheels and tires to 4-cyl models from 1987
onward, 944, 944S, 944T (all with M30 option), Turbo S 1988, Turbo 1989,
and S2 from 1989.

=46itting of 17" wheels on vehicles previously equipped with 16" wheels =
is
allowed, however you should also replace the caster adjustment parts so
that the alignment can be adjusted for the proper caster angle of 3 deg
15-45'.  The parts needed are:

Rear Mount	951 341 023 00, 2 each at roughly $40 each.
Eccentric		951 341 431 02, 2 each at roughly $50 each.
Bolts, 4 each (invalid part number listed on bulletin)

Hope this helps.
