I've been advised that my previous post, which suggests that the $400 timing 
belt tensioning tool (heretofor noted as "the tool") may not be necessary 
for proper re-assembly of timing belts on certain automobiles, might be 
misconstrued by some individuals to be a grant of authority to install said
timing belt without the benefit of "the tool", subsequently leading to 
malfunction of the timing belt and the attempt of certain mechanical components
of the alleged grantee's engine to occupy the same position in space and time, 
thus, in violation of certain laws of nature over which lawyers have no domain, 
resulting in monetary loss to the alleged grantee and subsequent claim in U.S. 
courts of law to the recovery of these losses from, who else?  Yours truly.

Therefor, to eliminate all peril to my fellow porschefan list members who might 
misinterpret my previous post, I feel it is in my best interest to retract those 
previous statements and pray to the gods that no litigious actions might be 
brought upon me in retribution for my obvious transgression.

Really folks.  If you think you need "the tool", by all means use it.  I guess
the 944 design is more like the Space Shuttle than I thought.  All I was trying
to say was that nobody can prove "the tool" is necessary.  Many of us hold 
in great esteem the man (or woman (whew, that was close!)) who can consistently 
throw a ball through an iron hoop from twenty-odd feet away.  I'm sure that a 
lot of mechanics have the human skill to set a 944 timing belt to the proper 
tension without the tool.  Although mechanics don't get multi-million dollar 
contracts, there's a certain art to the trade.  I bet a lot of them own "the 
tool" and probably used it for a while, remembering what the final result felt 
like in their hands, and now only keep "the tool" around in case some lawyer 
calls.  Some mechanics, both the professional and shade-tree variety, get a 
sense of adventure and accomplishment using high-tech tools and equipment even 
when they might not really be necessary.  I agree that the tool eliminates the 
human error factor, but I also wonder about instrument error and the errors 
associated with improper use of that instrument.  It's a $400 torque wrench. 
You can also be sued for not torquing bolts to the proper specifications if 
anyone can prove that it was contributory to an avoidable loss.

Oh my God, I'm really starting to write like a lawyer now!

Enough of this tool rambling.  Does anyone out there really know why some 
Porsche timing belts REQUIRE "the tool" to be tensioned properly?  If so, 
for the sake of God and everything holy, please speak up.  Then we can all
go on with our lives.
