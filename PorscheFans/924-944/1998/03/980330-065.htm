I've seen PCA regions implement passing protocol both ways: passed car stays
on-line or moves off-line.  I have a preference (esp. for beginning DE
students), and I've done it both ways, but that's not a major issue to me.

The safety issue with the "Backwards Blinker" usage as I'll call it, is that
it requires drivers of 10, 20, 30 years - however long - to spontaneously
learn to use the signal opposite to how they've been using it for their
driving life.  Introducing such divergence from standard leads to confusion,
misuse, and potentially dangerous situations where two drivers do not
communicate quickly and clearly.  This situation does not have to exist and
can be eliminated with a different approach.

I think the Backwards Blinker idea comes from a misguided intention.  Let me
illustrate my point.

There are basically two approaches to inter-driver communication:

- 1) The "I'll tell you what I'm doing" approach.  This is the standard that
the world operates with, and how drivers of all countries use electric
signal lamps to indicate in which direction they're moving their vehicle.
An interesting corollary is in Germany & Austria (& others I'm sure), where
hiway drivers wishing to pass another car in the left lane use their left
signal; this is consistent with the above because it shows they want to move
their car to the left of the leading/blocking vehicle.  It's a polite and
less aggressive (and legal) version of flashing the headlamps.

- 2) The "I'll tell you what I want you to do" approach.  Used nearly
exclusively in racing (or occasionally by drivers pulling to the roadside,
slow moving vehicles, etc.), this is a hand signal to indicate on which side
a following car should pass the leading driver, and that the leading driver
is ready for such a pass.

So the problem is that the *device* from approach #1 - the blinker lamp - is
used in place of the hand signal from approach #2.  This is the precise
failure point.

The solution is inferred from the preceding:
- Always use the blinker to indicate in which direction the driver is moving
the car, just as on public hiways.  On the track, the same rule applies and
further indicates that the leading driver expects the follower to pass.
- Use hand signals to indicate on which side the leader expects/wants to be
passed.

An interesting aside: Porsche 956 race cars had functional blinkers, and
they were used consistently with #1 above, when they were used (it was
racing...).

A related issue that prevents drivers from using standard hand signals in
PNWR is that the driver's window is required to be rolled up within 2 inches
of the top, at all times on the track.

Forcing the passee to move off-line is bizarre; but the use of the
"backwards turn signal" to indicate passing isn't. Many organizations that
demand the use of safety nets (or rolled-up windows) use the "signal the
side you want to be passed on" rule. It does take a bit of getting used to,
but I can't think of a better solution (given the safety net
consideration). Anyone?
