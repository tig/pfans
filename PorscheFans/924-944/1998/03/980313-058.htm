<< To help cut down on the length of the list we could be more concise as =
 to how much we quote. Some of us have gotten a bit carried away with quot=
 es and don't think about how long it takes to sort through it all. >>

All, I think an additional helper is to be as clear and concise in the subject
heading as possible.  I used to subscribe to the digest, but I find it much
easier to get the real-time version, and when it gets overwhelming, screeen
messages by the title.  This list is about the only thing I use this
screenname for though, and I realize real-time list viewing could be a problem
for people trying to do other things with thier email accounts.  However,
keeping the subjects as accurate as possible should help all concerned.

My .02 cents.
