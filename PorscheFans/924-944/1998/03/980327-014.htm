Hi Paul,
    The important question is not wether the force is more or less if
the harness is attached to the rear seat belt mounts and draped over
the bar ( it varies by the way).
   The real question is did the manufacturer properly engineer 
the bar for the application.  There is much more to a harness 
guide bar or any of this stuff  than just welding a piece of pipe to
an end bracket.  It does not matter what the force is if the part is
properly designed to take it.
    I can show you two brackets of welded metal that the average
educated person would swear were identical in every way. Yet, one of
them would kill you and one could save your life.  The difference is
in the design and the manufacture.>>>>

Hi Dodge,

Have you SEEN the Weltmeister bar? Mike Mitchell bent one when he hit an
unmovable obstacle at approx. 35 mph. (This was a while ago, so correct
me if my recollection is wrong...) A bent harness guide bar,
particularly when it is being used with a greater than 90 degree angle,
will create enough room to allow the harness straps to slip off your
shoulders. I'll leave it to your imagination what would happen next...

Regards,

Paul
