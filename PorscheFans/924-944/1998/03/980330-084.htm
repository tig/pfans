My personal preference is to let let the passee decide whether to keep the
line or no, based on track geography. In general I don't like passee
students to have to move off-line because of the possibility of marbles,
possibility of task overload, etc.

This is true. The way I get around it personally is to visualize myself in
the passing car and signal accordingly. However, I also have no problems
"following" the signal (i.e., doing the "wrong" thing) when I'm the one
doing the passing. My own fave is the hand motions, but I suspect that is
because that's what I learned first <shrug>.

I don't think we'll ever have consensus on this and a lot of issues related
to driver ed. There certainly seems to be a large element of NIH present.
(It can't be right/good because it was not-invented-here) The Internet has
"made the world smaller" - before we used to discuss differences within
Zone (everyone in Zone1 remember the 944 control arm issue?), now it seems
there are even larger differences coast-to-coast. So be it. Let's hope we
can learn from each other and make things safer for everyone.

Cheers,
Craig.
