Though I don't own a 951or any turbo machine of that sort, I'd think
that water spraying onto the intercooler would be a nice idea to give
that little extra umph in cooling the compressed air. Yet, what type of
material is the intercooler made of? If the water sprayed only on full
boost as you proposed, still the thought of external oxidation and
eventually rust comes to my mind. Suggestion: would installing a small
electric fan directly against the intercooler running at a high speed be
an alternative? I'm sure you'd need to run additional wiring and perhaps
a relay to make this bugger work. Shouldn't be too hard to think out how
to rig this up........though it won't be original stock factory. So,
don't expect to win any concours awards if you compete in car shows.
Just an idea to share with.
