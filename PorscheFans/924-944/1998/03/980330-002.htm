Thanks, Bob!

The water seems to be leaking from either the upper radiator hose (where it
joins the radiator) or the heat sensor just below it. I could not see it
until I took off the pan under the engine, which was easy. I'm really glad
you gave me the suggestion not to start with the belt covers.

The reason I can't tell which of the two places it leaks from is that the
sensor hides the bottom of the hose when looking from underneath, and the
hose hides the top of the sensor. I removed the hose, but even with the
hose off, the connecting pipe still hides the sensor. So with the hose on,
I can only see that the sensor bottom is definitely leaking or is being
leaked upon by the hose. With the hose off, of course, water definitely
wets the sensor from above.

The hose is not obviously bad, but it is pretty soft. It also came off the
pipe with surprising ease after I loosened the clamp. The clamp is
difficult to get to, and may be difficult to tighten fully. But it did not
slip on the hose until loosened, so I thought it might have been OK. All
radiator hoses I have ever removed have been harder to remove. The only
thing I can think of is that not too long ago the PO had water in the oil
cooler, and the hose may have been removed fairly recently while repairing
that, or when cleaning out the cooling system afterwards.

So, first, are Porsche hoses pretty soft normally, or is that a sign of age
and time to replace? There are no bulges in the hose or cracks in the
rubber.

Second, is there something that one can put on the hose or pipe that makes
it easy to remove later?

Third, is there something that one can put on the hose or pipe that makes
it seal well even if the clamp is only moderately tight?

Fourth, is the heat sensor a screw-on device? Should I attempt to tighten
that if I can get to it? Or try reinstalling the hose first because the
heat sensor is difficult to deal with?

Fifth, I think I saw a post that said that the headlamps can be raised by
some switch under the hood without turning on the headlights. It may be
easier to get to the area if I do that. Do you know where the switch is and
how to do this?

Thanks again,
