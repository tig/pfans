Thank God - I was starting to think I had the only 944T (sorry, cousins,=20
951) this side of the Pond.

David - don't muck about:  if you plan to service your car at the=20
regular 12K intervals, stick to Mobil 1.  If, on the other hand, you=20
plan to keep the car forever and a day, you should start doing=20
oil+filter at 3-4k intervals.  Now, I suspect that in that case you=20
could use a good quality conventional multigrade.  I am pretty sure you=20
wouldn't want to spend the =A360 on a Mobil 1 oil change every 3K - I=20
don't enjoy it much myself - and I sometimes wonder if it's worth it.

Any thoughts on synthetics, you lot?

Subject: Which engine oil?

I have just bought an automatic 944 for 'her indoors' which is my first
experience of them, so I will be asking a 'silly question a day' for a=20
month
or so.

Today's question is what is the best engine oil, and at what intervals
should it be changed. The car is an Auto 1986 having done 86k miles but=20
no
sign of wear.  It's these new thin oils I am wondering=20
about..........all
this 0w/40 and 5w/50 seems very thin for an older engine.

What do you think?.............
