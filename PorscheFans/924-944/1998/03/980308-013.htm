    I keep thinking about your explanation but I can't quite understand the
difference between what the dual chamber does and the stock wastegate does.
Does anyone on the list understand exactly how the dual chamber is an advantage
over the stock wastegate.  I've had people tell me the stock wastegate will
work fine and I've had people tell me I need an aftermarket wastegate.  I'm
sure I'm going to try the stock wastegate first(what have I got to lose) with
my GReddy Profec.

This is the line I can't understand:
 "When the boost pressure gets close to blow off or there is a pressure wave
spike then the wastegate valve lifts off the seat and starts chattering."

  What does the stock setup do with the stock wastegate when the boost pressure
gets close to blow off or there is a pressure wave spike?  Do these same
conditions not exist without a boost control?  There is also boost limit in a
stock situation, it just varies under different loads.  I've got a feeling I
will end up having to go with a dual chamber wastegate and I would like to
understand why.
