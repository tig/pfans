Howdy,

Paul and I made it back in one piece from the autocross at Kent, WA
yesterday.  We decided to go down for an event called "Weather or Not" hosted
by the Boeing Employees Autosport Club (BEAC).  We've gone to this event for
three years in a row now.  It's interesting in that they keep the course the
same each year and the weather seems to be the same each year (wet).

Last year and this year, the weather was eerily identical.  Really wet in
the morning, drying by the afternoon.  Last year, I ran the slick Hoosiers
and ran a very slow 56.6 or something like that, Paul had a 54.9 if my memory
is correct.  If any of you have the video I made up, that was the event you
see me spinning out in.  Bill B. I think ran a 49.? that year as the course
dried out.

This year, the weather for our runs was identical to last, nice and slippery.
Kent is an interesting track, bumpy and made of what seems like large
rocks.  The course is reasonably technical, it feels like a Karen Babb
course (I don't know if she designed it or not originally).  Paul ran first
with a very fast 55.6 almost bettering his last year time on his first run.
Keep in mind that Paul was running street tires (I think an "R" tire would
be faster in those conditions as long as it had some tread depth).  His
second run was a 54.9, third a 54.5 and the fourth a 53.8.  The fastest car
in his run group I think was Stacey Molleker (sp?) in a Neon at 51.9??.
Another fast car was Scotty White's co-driver at 52.???, maybe even 51's,
I can't remember.

I ran in the next run group, conditions the same as the morning.  My first
run was one of those wierd things in life, I don't know what happened, but
it was really, really slow, even though it felt pretty good.  Off the line,
I spun the tires really, really badly, I thought I killed the clutch because
the car wasn't moving at all.  Anyways, my first run was a 59.0.  I asked
Glen Hernandez to ride with me to see what I was doing wrong.  I missed
a gate on the first run, maybe I drove around something I wasn't supposed
to and made the time higher???  Glen wanted a base line run to work from,
so I went out and got a 2nd run time of 55.6.  That was more like it.
A few changes here and there, as recommended by Glen and the time came down
to 54.9 for my third run.  The fourth run Glen wanted to me to go alone,
so I gave it all I had, swinging the car around a bit and came in with a
53.6.  My two previous runs, I had some nice counter steering, full boost
slides going :)

In my run group, the fastest car was an RX-7 TT R1 with a 51.???  There was
a Viper GTS out, but I didn't get a chance to watch the new driver have fun
in it.  Anyways, I came away feeling good from that event and I think Paul
was very happy too.  At least, we're getting closer :)

As usual, Glen was a big help, I wrote in my article in the DSM/944 magazine
(has anyone got them yet, haven't heard a word from you guys?) that Glen's
advice is worth at least a second, this time him just sitting in the car
was worth 4 seconds :)

Anyhow, if you were there, do you know what times Glen and Bill ran at the
end of the day?  I would expect them to be very fast since they are fast
to begin with and the track was drying up nice when we left.  How did
Glen's co-driver do?  I saw him spin a few times, but didn't catch his
times, he's my competition next Sunday.

Bill Kim, if you're out there, did you get the envlope I left on your car?

Unfortunately, Tom and Scott were not able to make it, but there were quite
a few 944's, 924's and 968's around, a few from the list too.

I can't wait for next week now!  We have 30 people signed up, I'm sure at
least 25 of which will actually run.
