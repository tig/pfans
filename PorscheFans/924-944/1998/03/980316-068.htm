I have had my 83 944 for just about 4 years. Unless you cannot afford a more
expensive car (e.g. NEWER or MORE RESTORED) it may turn out to be a good car,
but it will take SUBSTANTIAL financial and personal commitment on your part to
keep the car on the road year round.

Since I bought mine for $6,000 in 1994, I have invested nearly $20,000 in it
(read 2 clutches, 2 timing jobs, w/pump, tires, fuel pump, radiator, cam cover
gasket job, cracked firewall repair {BIG COST}, shocks, wheel restoration, 2
window motors, master and slave clutch cyls., and LOTS of maintenance work
such as brakes, fluid flushing, etc. etc. etc.)

Why? Because I absolutely LOVE the car. Is this irrational and not cost
effective? Absolutely. This reminds me of that guy from Manhattan on the list
w/ a 944 cabrio who had invested more than me in just 2 years and was relieved
that his wife didn't know about Porschefans...

My advice: If you can, buy the newest 968 you can afford. Otherwise, get your
wallet ready and sign up for a couple of extra credit cards.
By no means is this meant to discourage you from buying a used Porsche. If you
have a regular source of income, the monthly payments on a newer car simply
beat the "Oh no, what now" of my beloved 83.

Good luck and good for you in considering joining the ranks. It takes guts.
