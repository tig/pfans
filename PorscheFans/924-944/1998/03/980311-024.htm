This is correct.  The 951-341-023-00 part has been superseeded by the -01
part.  There is also a Club Sport part available, 951-341-023-30.  It is
available from some dealers who have them, but not from PCNA.  The list =
on
this baby is $232!  Compare that to about $40 for the upgraded 951 part
(also used on 968).  I believe the only difference is harder rubber, and =
I
don't even know whether the CS part would be as good as the upgraded 951
part because...=20

Today I stopped at my dealer and looked at the -01 part.  There is a huge
difference between it and my stock S2 part.  The S2 mount has a LOT of
rubber and only a thin metal cover around it, like that used on a sway
bar.  The upgraded part has just a thin rubber insert with a substantial
metal piece around it.  Much less rubber + much more metal =3D much =
better
control.

># 951.341.431.02 (excenter bolt)

This is also used as standard on the 968 and I'm told it is serrated to
hold the caster setting better.  Both these parts seem like a must have
items for a tracked 944.  I'm ordering mine tomorrow :-)
