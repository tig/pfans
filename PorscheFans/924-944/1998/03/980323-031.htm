Please do not take what I am about to say as a "slam" its just MY OPINION! 

Please hold all flames from the "Milledge" support network!!!

The following is kind of long......

Hello P-Fans

I think that we should share all of our information! 

Any engine builder that will not tell you how he torques down a cylinder head
or what bolts (or studs) he uses is just full of it!!! My BS detector seems to
go off a lot when ever this Milledge guy is talked about. If he is the all
knowing 944 Guru that a few P-Fans say he is, then why is HE not posting to
the list himself!  

I think we have quite a few knowledgeable people on "our" P-Fans list. Jim
Pasha, Bruce Anderson, Don Istook, George B, just to name a few.

I don't ever remember reading one of those guys saying "Sorry I can't tell you
that, its top secret" !!!

I have quite few friends in the Porsche tuning business, and I keep all of
those personal opinions to my self. However, I find some of the stuff being
said about Milledge to be very biased. I have heard many things about Milledge
and not one of them is positive! Now, I will not repeat what has been told to
me but I will say that it is not positive. And not all of it was from his
competitors.  I know with the Internet it is very easy to spread "fiction"
good or bad about a person or company, 

I mean we are not asking how and where he ports his cylinder heads, just what
sequence and what bolts he uses in the motor! 

What if you ask him to what clearances he sets his engine to? Is that top
secret as well? 

I personally would not hesitate to build an engine with the stock engine studs
(just buy new nuts & washers!!!). Just follow the manuals installation
instructions regarding lube of stud threads. 

Now if I was building a race motor that's a different story. Building a race
motor, you make certain concessions, you trade a certain life or reliability
for more power. The engine builder job is to balance it out!

I went to a tour of White Post Restorations last week, the owner there made a
statement that I found of particular interest. The owner Billy Thompson said:
" There is nothing you can not ask me, where I buy this or that... who does
our sublets for various things, motor rebuilds, glass, chrome, ect..." This is
a guy willing to help other car guys out! Even if he does not do the repair!!!
White Post routinely does restorations from $20K to $500K, and they are
willing to share their many years of knowledge!!!

My point is any time someone tries to tell you their art (be it bodyshop,
engine builder or what ever...) is this black art craft, I think that they are
full of it! My BS sensor goes off. I mean some things should be held close,
but the "nuts & bolts" things should be able to "share" with fellow car nuts!

Bruce Anderson has a good saying that seems to ring a bell "loud and clear"
for me!  

I will quote Bruce here from his book: "Porsche has selected the best quality
components for most applications, which makes it very difficult to improve on
what Porsche has done!" 



I think to answer the question posed by the P-Fan who started all of this, is
just to use the OEM stock studs if you are simply looking to put you car back
on the road. If however you are willing to trade the safety feature of a blown
head gasket for piston/cylinder damage go with the Raceware or ARP engine
studs. Personally I would opt for the OEM studs. 

I would be curious to hear if anyone has experienced a blow head gasket with
the Raceware or ARP studs or a failed head gasket with an O-ring head and OEM
studs.


Good Luck
again this was just my $0.02 cents worth.
