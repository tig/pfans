go ahead, do it...

Think of it as restarting the clock on a time bomb that is ticking
all the time... It usually goes off sometime after 30K miles, but sometimes
even earlier...

Since I have the now famous P9201 tool and a bit of experience, I change
the timing belt at 15K miles, the cost of the belt being $10 USD and the
time to install is about $20 minutes...
