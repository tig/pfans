Hello again. My 85.5 944's engine, since I have owned it, has been making an
awful whine. Immediately after I bought it, per advice from my mechanic (after
initial diagnose), I had the water pump, timing belt, and rollers changed.
Unfortunately, I am still getting that whine. I believe it was alleviated for
a while after the change but came back. Could this be because the belt to be
re-tightened? Would doing that (which I will have done soon) fix the noise. I
have regretfully noticed that the belt (timing or other, I am still learning
about the car and don't know much) does not hit one of the rollers at all, as
it stays stationery. If anyone has had this problem, and has some ideas,
please help me out. Thank you.
