Time to clean out the garage.

For Sale:

Set of (4) Speedline 3 pc. 18" wheels (Aliseo model)

Removed from a 88 944 Turbo S (offset clears larger calipers). I understand
these fit the 88, 89 951's and most 928's and 911's. Excellent condition.
Installed by previous owner so I can't identify when they were purchased
new. Selling b/c I prefer the look and ride quality of the stock 16" Cup
wheels (installed last week). Also includes a set of Bridgestone S-01
Expedia's (225/40/18 F & 265/35/18 R). Tread wear is at 70% according to my
mechanic.

Price: $3750 (purchaser pays shipping/handling/insurance -- I saw these
exact wheels in Pano 3 months ago where I guy was asking $5000 (whew))

Also:

Set of (2) factory Sport seats (8 way power) in excellent condition with
the lovely burgandy plaid cloth thrown in at no extra cost. If you have an
88 951 S (Silver Rose) with tired cloth seating areas, worn bolsters, etc.,
these seats will make you a happy camper.

Price: $850 ($150 extra if you want the rear seats as well (also exc
condition)). Purchaser pays shipping/handlin/insurance -- I also saw these
exact seats listed in Pano 2 months ago for $1300. No, I'm not sure what
that guy was smoking either.

Please pardon the shameless Pano marketing comparisons. Interested parties
please e-mail me at bryce.williams@oncare.com.

Regards.
