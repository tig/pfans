I don't know if it is a record, but Porsche did a publicity stunt in 1987 in
which a PR guy from Porsche drove a 944 500.000 kilometres. According to 911
& Porsche world, the idea was to drive as far as the moon and back within 12
months. Afterwards the car was signed by Ferry Porsche, and the registration
plate on the car read LU-NA 944.
