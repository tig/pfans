I've been following the belt tension thread for a while now.  I can tell
you that the Porsche dealer here in town does NOT recommend using the
tension tool on the balance shafts, instead they use the 1/2 turn
method, because they say otherwise the belt whines.  They do however
recommend the tool on the timing belt.

Just have to insert my two pennies here when I say that I wish someone
with the knowledge would address Jay's question about what IS so special
about the timing belt system in the Porsche's.  This is the only car
I've ever owned that thought the belt tension so critical.  Are the
belts weaker in these cars?   If the belt is thinner or something I
could see how overtension would certainly cause failure sooner, but
undertension would cause....what?  On the other side of the fense, do
these belts fail significantly sooner than other cars belts??....Yeah, I
think so.  My Honda went 130K before I changed the belt.  From what I
hear my Porsche would never make that.  That in itself should say that
the Porsche needs special attention when it comes to timing belts...but
someone out there please tell me why that is so that I can sleep at
night.   :)

Oh, and I keep reading about people that call the 944 a maintenance
nightmare, spending upwards of $20K on them to keep them running.  WOW. 
I've found mine to be pretty normal as far as maintenance on a 13 year
old car goes.  Sure, some the parts are more expensive, and if you don't
fix them yourself the dealers will love you for the labor cost, but the
labor to work on a Ford sportscar (do they make one?) is close to the
same hourly, and a 13 year old Ford will require a HELL of a lot more
visits to the dealer I would think.  Bottom line, my experience so far
has been that it needs clutches and steering pumps and seals and..... 
but so would any other 13 year+ car, and this one doesn't need an engine
rebuild....say that for a 100K+ mile American sportscar.  A car pushing
this age needs one of two types of owner I would think.  Either one who
loves to work on his car, or one who's wallet and wife understand that
the car in the garage is not new, or even close.  Perhaps the reason
I've had such good luck is that I was VERY, VERY picky about which car I
bought.  It took me 4 months of driving all over Florida to find this
car, and since I was so picky.....I got what I wanted.  Now I think I'll
order that new clutch I've been not really wanting to replace....Damn
Porsche money pit   :)  Just kidding.
