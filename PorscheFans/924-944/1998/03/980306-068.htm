PorscheFans --

The car is a newly acquired 1986 944 NA with very low miles (but unwisely
stored outdoors for about seven years). The exterior, including the red
paint, is in fine shape, except in places on the engine hood. Toward the
nose and in a small spot on the aft end of the hood, passenger side, the
paint has gone orangish and shows "check cracking" (a faint pattern of tiny
jigsaw-like etchings). It looks as though it has been baked from
overexposure to engine heat.

Under the hood the insulation lining has mostly disintegrated. Was this heat
or sound insulation? Did its deterioration lead to cooking the paint?

I took the car to a Porsche mechanic who finds the engine in excellent
condition, and it shows no signs of overheating.

Robert
