I find this whole thread on timing belts to be pretty humorous. First of
all, 
that $500 tool is far from a precision measuring device. Secondly,
having been
a mechanic for a number of years I can guarantee you the majority of the 
mechanics you're paying $80/hr to work on your car don't take the time
to
properly use it. It's just a timing belt. If it's too tight it will
trash the 
bearings on the water pump or the idlers and make lots of noise. If it's
too loose 
it will flap around, make noise, and perhaps jump time at high RPMS
(really loose). 
It's not going to catastrophically fail because it's 20% out of the
factory spec. 
Let's let this subject die as it's obvious consensus is not going to
happen in this 
forum.

My 2cents...
