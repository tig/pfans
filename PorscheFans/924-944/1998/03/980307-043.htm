Thanks to my wife, we use USAA too.  The 944 is not my daily driver
and it comes to a little over $500/yr.

For those who are unfamiliar with USAA, it is a group limited to
active or retired US military officers.  But prior to getting
married, I was covered under a different group plan and was
also getting decent rates.  So look around a bit - ask your
HR person at work if there are any deals, etc.
