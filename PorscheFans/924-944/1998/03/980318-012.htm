     I just took a quick look at Randall's results for the dyno.  Some
impressive
     numbers.  If you do a dyno run, try and do it in 4th gear.

The first time I went to the dyno I did not know that it was better to
do a fourth gear run and the second time I wanted to do the third gear
run to compare to my first dyno and I did runs in both 3rd & 4th.


      By looking at the runs in 3rd, I would say there are no problems,
but looking
     at the run in 4th shows an unusual immediate decline in HP at
5500rpm, kind
     of like a pyramid drop.  It should be a smooth arc, rather than a
sudden
     drop.  A sudden drop like that could be a number of things:
     1. not enough fuel to maintain correct A/F ratio
     2. timing is backing down because of detonation
     3. incorrect chip programming
     4. flow of motor is maxed

I could tell there was a problem by looking at the dyno charts done in
3rd gear I can't
understand why you can't see that the power falls off suddenly on those
runs.  Your observations
are pretty good but you don't say how to fix.  I think Nos. 1 and 2 are
the most likely.  After I get
my adjustable boost control I'll try to re-dyno with racing fuel if I
can find it.  If that doesn't help
I may try the rising rate fuel pressure regulator.

     Sorry Randall, still more tuning needed, there's another 10-15hp
out there
     for the taking :)  Another thing I'm concerned about is why it
takes so
     much boost to make good power in your car.  If I remember right,
the boost
     being run to get the good numbers was 1.25bar.

You are giving me a lot of information I already know, what I need is
information on how to
go about diagnosing the problem.  I agree I should have more HP.  And
you remember wrong
or you did not read my e-mail.  The boost on the dyno is not the same as
the boost on the street.
I wanted to get 1.1 bar on the dyno but ended up getting 1.2 bar.  The
dyno information has to
entered before the run and before knowing what the boost will reach.
Installing the MFS changed
the boost and I was running at 1.5 bar at first but lowered back to the
1.2 bar.  As soon as I get the
boost controller I will probably run 1 bar most of the time.  Monday's
dyno runs were at 1.2 bar.

Thanks for trying to help anyway.  It seems to me good help is hard to
find when trying to tune in
for high HP numbers.  I think very few people really know how and the
ones that do are "in" to racing
and don't share that info easily.  Also you get different advice from
everyone, so who do you believe?
