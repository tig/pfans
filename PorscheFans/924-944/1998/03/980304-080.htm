I can think of a problem. 

In order for a pump to work, there has to be a return line.
The fluid has to flow FROM the brake fluid reservoir (located 
on top of the master cylinder on our cars) TO the brake calipers,
and then FROM the brake calipers back TO the reservoir. The current
brake plumbing system only has the lines that go TO the calipers.
So you would have to add the return line. Not terrible, but now 
you have twice as many brake lines, with the resultant likelyhood
of brake line problems. 

Another problem is that all modern braking systems are dual zone.
This way, if you have a leak in one line, you don't lose all your
brakes. I assume that in order to preserve that feature, you would
need two brake fluid pumps, one for each zone. Again, not terrible,
but something to think about.
