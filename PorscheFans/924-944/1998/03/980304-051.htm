Hello,

> I'm just curious... has anyone tried the AC rapid fire spark plugs? 

I have them in my car now. 

> Did they work well?

Well, the car starts and runs OK. Perhaps it's me, but I can never
really feel a difference between various spark plugs. I've had
the Bosch platinum, standard Bosch copper, standard AC copper,
and now the AC rapid fire. 

The only thing I have noticed was with the Bosch platinum the
motor needed to crank longer before it started.

Last year I ran regular AC copper plugs. They worked great,
fired the mixture just fine at Wide Open Throttle (WOT) and
full boost. They also cost less than a buck a plug. 

When I went to the parts place to buy new plugs, the only
ones they had were the Rapid fire, so I bought them. I have
not noticed any difference, except they cost more like
$4 a plug.
