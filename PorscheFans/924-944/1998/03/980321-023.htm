I noticed in Jim Richmond's post that he suggests scotch bright for cleaning
metal as it will not remove metal. I am under the impression that this is not
true, and that it will in fact remove metal just fine, especially aluminum.
Many people seem to think it is just a hard plastic miracle cleaner or
something, but to the best of my knowledge it is actually very hard abrasive
imbedded in a resinous coating. The main advantage of using it over plain old
sandpaper is that it will not clog and it will find its way into irregular
shaped places without falling apart. I believe 3m makes different colors and
versions of "abrasive pads" with different grit sizes and hardnesses. I would
not be too quick to scour a cylinder wall with it, as I suspect it could clean
off the particles of silicon that give it its wear resistance. I am also under
the impression that the silicon is throughout the aluminum casting, not just
applied to the walls. The compounding after boring is to leave a fresh coating
there for the bedding in process, but my guess is this wears away quickly
leaving mostly the stuff that is there all along. If anyone knows otherwise, I
stand corrected. Frenna@aol.com
