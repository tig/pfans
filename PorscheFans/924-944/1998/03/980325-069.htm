I have been watching this thread with particular interest.

Last season was my first season with a Porsche, a 93 968.  As a new member
of Nord Stern region I had to attend a special Friday DE for beginners.  The
way it works is anyone w/o high speed experience on our track (BIR) must
attend the Friday session during which they spend the entire day with an
instructor.  On Saturday morning, I got a new instructor who rode with me
until me felt I was demonstrating reasonable driving skill and proper
attitude.  Then he signed me off and I was able to solo, however I remained
under the watchful eyes of the safety people.

Last season I drove 34 full track days with 5 different car clubs, 4
different PCA regions, 2 different BMWCCA regions and by the end of the
season was asked to be an instructor for beginners for 2 non-PCA events.
(Just trying to lay some ground here.)

My experience with Metro New York was the worst of all the events and clubs
I came in contact with.

I ran with MNY at Pocono Int'l Raceway on the north track in late October.
On the first day I found myself in the slowest group.  My instructor was
Peter Dawe (the shining star in a otherwise less than pleasurable weekend.)
In the first session I was lapping traffic.  By the last session of the day
for my group I lapped my entire group 3 times.  On the second day Peter and
two other instructors that I was garaged with went to the registrar to
suggest I be placed into a faster group as my times were within 3-4 seconds
of the events fastest cars/drivers.  The registrar refused to move my class
and it even took a great deal of talking to convince the registrar I should
be allowed to solo.  It should be noted the registrar was driving a RS
America in the fastest group however he was possible the slowest driver in
the class.  When I timed him he was turning slower lap times than I was.

Even other drivers in my class that I was constantly passing were asking me
why I was in their class.

I bring this all up as an example of good intentions having a terrible
result.  I obviously had the driving skills to be in a faster group, one in
which I would have been passing others much less, if at all.  Less passing
would have made the group a safer group and I would not have intimidated
some of the drivers in the slow group allowing them a high level of comfort,
confidence and fun.

I think having set rules that never have exception is ineffective as in the
case above which actually created a potentially unsafe environment.  All the
other regions and club I have run with have an instructor ride with you for
the first session or more depending on the skills and attitude you
demonstrate. I feel this has worked quite well. Of all the regions and
clubs, Nord Stern, Chicago and Allegheny PCA regions stand out as being the
most organized, fun and SAFE to run with.  I doubt I will ever run with MNY
again due to their attitude and what I consider to be lack of safety. (There
was more about this weekend I didn't get into.)

P.S.	Nord Stern has timed runs. I think most of us in this region enjoy them
and enjoy getting an award at the end of the season.  I think its unfair to
make a statement like "I would avoid these like the plague."  I seriously
doubt we have any "incidents" attributable to the timing.  If you are an
aggressive driver on the edge, it doesn't matter whether the lap is timed or
not.
