The spinning at Lime Rock was to give you some time to put some distance
between us so I could reel you back in. I didn't want to pass you for two
reasons:

1. It was pathetic enough that my over weight '86 951 was on the tail of YOUR
cat less, Turbo S, which weighted about 200lbs less then mine and had +/- 40
extra HP (excluding the weight advantage you had).
2. I wanted you to regain your confidence after that whole passing under
yellow problem you had.

To the other members of this list: Face it, it's been pretty boring on this
list recently so between this and the Tweeks thread at least it's somewhat
interesting!
