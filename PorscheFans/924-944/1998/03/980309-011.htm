Hi Larry,

I just went through this on my 85.5 944na.  I am sorry to report that 
you really do need the special tool to set tension.  The two belts 
involved (timing & balance) are very narrow belts and the tensioning 
method is diabolitically complex in execution in spite of the fact that 
it is simple to do.  The guage is a must.  

Because the belts are so narrow, it is very easy to over-tension them.  
It is also easy to under-tension them.  My personal belief is that many 
of the "experts" tend to over-tension as a matter of course.  In my 
opinion this is one of the primary causes of the premature water pump 
failure so often noted in this group newsletter as the back side of the 
belt runs the water pump.

First you must beg, borrow, or buy the tensioning tool.  I am an old 
mechanic myself and was simply unable to find a way to consistently set 
the belt tension without it.  

First, jack the front of the car up for access underneath.  944s are 
not known for good jacking points so I ran mine up ramps using 1/2" 
plywood extended ramps to clear the bumper.  Then I took a post jack 
to the the crossmember to take it even higher.  Pull all spark plugs.  
Spin the engine with a socket wrench on the crankshaft center bolt to get 
a feel for the resistence before you take it apart.

1.  Remove the splash guard under the engine if you have one.
2.  Remove alternator & a/c belts.
3.  Remove upper & lower plastic belt covers.
4.  Release tension from the balance shaft belt.
5.  Remove the plug from the dist cap mount.
6.  Turn crankshaft until the TDC mark on the camshaft sprocket aligns 
with the cast mark.
7.  Check scribe mark on flywheel is visible through the clutch housing 
hole and opposite the TDC mark.
8.  Check that the balance shaft marks are aligned with the marks on the 
rear belt cover.  NOTE: Check both upper and lower balance shaft 
sprockets.  Make sure that you understand the marks and can find them 
before you disassemble.
9.  Remove the balance shaft belt.
10.  Remove the dist. cap, rotor, and metal belt cover.
11.  Remove tension from the cam belt.
12.  Replace the cam belt, starting with looping the belt around the 
crankshaft pulley first and proceeding in a clockwise manner to all the 
other pulleys and spockets.
13.  Double, triple check to make sure that you are on the correct mark.
14.  Install the balance belt, again checking all marks on upper and 
lower balance shafts. 
15.  Put an initial tension on both belts, then spin the engine twice 
around to make sure that valves aren't hitting pistons and to set the 
belts firmly into their sprockets.
16.  Bring the upper cam sprocket to alignment with the mark, then rotate 
the engine backwards a bit, about 1 1/2 teeth of the sprocket.  
17.  Check the tension on the cam belt.  This is where you will get 
recommendations all over the map, from as low as 1.6 on the guage to as 
high as 6.0.  My feeling is 2.4-3.0 for both new and used cam belts.

HERE IS THE TRICK:  Spin the engine around twice, back it up 1 1/2 teeth, 
and check it again.  Don't be surprised if the tension reading has 
magically changed!  Also the balance shaft sprocket may be off by a 
tooth.  If so, re-set the balance belt on the sprocket.  Do it again and 
again until you get consistent cam belt tension readings and the sprocket 
marks all line up.

18.  Now do the balance belt.  Double check again that the sprockets are 
at the correct marks.
19.  Tension the belt.  If your guide roller has no slot, the gauge 
should read 4.0-4.6 for a new belt or 3.7-4.3 for a used belt.  If your 
guide roller has a slot then go 2.4-3.0 for either new or used.  Then 
spin twice, back up, and check again.  
  
20.  You're done!  Just button it up again and off you go.  Check it 
again in 1500 miles.  These are 90,000 mile belts but you will find many 
recommendations to replace them at 30,000 miles.  Your choice, but 
things get VERY expensive if the belt breaks.  The thing to know is that 
the belts themselves have a lot of tolerance for either over or under 
tensioning and that the tension is only required to control the slap or 
snaking on the return side of the belt while running.  Tension makes 
little or no difference to valve timing.  Over tensioning will place 
heavy loads on the water pump bushing as well as all the various bearings 
in the belt tensioners and pulleys and will also shorten the life of the 
belt itself.  Under tensioning allows the belt to whip around, perhaps to 
damage itself and maybe allow the water pump to slip.

Good luck,
Greg Laws
