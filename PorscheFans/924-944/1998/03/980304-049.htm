I would not suspect the alternator, as if it was the cause for your engine
stalling, that would have meant your battery was also drained.  Unless
there's a loose connection somewhere, but I wouldn't find that likely.

It sounds to me more like a fuel starvation problem.  But then again, if
that was the case, why would it restart after a few tries?  I love
answering questions with even less helpful questions....  I was responding
more to come to the alternator's defense.  I've had two of them go bad in
my other cars, and in both cases the car died like yours because the
battery ran down.  Even if the problem with your alternator is
intermittant, I wouldn't expect the car to die until the battery was
drained.
