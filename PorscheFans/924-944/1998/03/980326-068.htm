Craig --

It is a LOT of fun. Pushing to the reasonable limit happens to be my
preference, but not that of everyone who attends. Some folks have driven
RMR DE for several years and choose to stay in the slowest practice
session.  You can set your own driving goals, your speed, and the level of
danger you care to be exposed to.  That's the DE side of things.  If you
want more, you have to earn your way into a faster practice session, and
the main criterion is predictability.  Nobody wants you pushing your
envelope in their practice session if they can't trust you.  Kind of a
self-regulating system.  Honest, we don't run newbies into the weeds for
grins. 

Someone mentioned PCA regions that allow you to pass anywhere on the track
during DE. Now that's dangerous.
