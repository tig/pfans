Paul,

This seems a tad drastic.  I have done many driving events with other clubs
(BMW CCA, etc) and at this point I am looking for a way to ease into club
racing.  I don't see a better transition than a time trial.  Timing forces
the driver to become faster by being smoother.  Personally I don't see a
problem with time trials, although they are different than driver education
track days....  Do you think it would be better to be thrown from a DE
right into club racing?!?  I do wish that our local PCA chapter would offer
both (DE and TT), but to be honest it isn't really a big thing.  You can
always start at a BMW CCA event first to get used to things on the track...
