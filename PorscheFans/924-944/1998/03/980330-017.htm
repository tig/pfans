greetings,
i'm the lucky buyer of bens 86 951 and have a few questions that should be
easy ones for all of ya....

1-what's the procedure to replace the 'snowflake' AC dash switch. Automobile
Atlanta sells the switch separately. does anybody else?? AA wants approx. $90.

2-while i'm in the ballpark, the clock LCD display (redundant, i know..) has
broken. can this be replaced and where can i get one? used??

3-this is my first 944, and i think the dash lites are a bit dim. you could
play football at nite under my 73 914 dash lites...does anyone else have this
concern?  short of using contact cleaner on the dash lite dimmer wheel,
anything else i can check? 

4-does the pump providing coolant to the turbo ALWAYS run after shutting the
engine off?  how long? 

5-i know this will vary, but- what's considered a 'normal' reading on engine
temp gauge?  or, more importantly....when should i get concerned?!

6-headlite washers...the owners manual says to activate these you push the
wiper switch towards the front of the car. mine doesn't move that way. could
this switch have been replaced? the windshield washers work great, and i
really don't care about washing my headlites, but if something's supposed to
work.......

7-what fuse controls the electric mirrors? mine aren't operational right now.
i couldn't find the info on the diagram on the fuse box.  i think they got
messed up during a recent stereo installation and the associated wiring near
the console switch. any thoughts? 

8-the cruise control works fine, but sometimes adds 5+ mph to where you want
to set it.  i'm already going too fast.....ugh! this thing wants to RUN!

TIA
