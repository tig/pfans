It is primarily a matter of logistics, Rich.  Besides the 750 entrants,
there are a lot of non-entrant PCA (staff and workers) and non-PCA people
(vendors, factory personnel, etc.), which could bring the total number of
people participating to well over 1200-1300.  The Parade site has to be
able to provide adequate housing and banquet facilities, and don't forget
that it takes about 4 years to properly plan one of these events.

For anyone interested:

I am going to try to get the registrar to permit some sort of "signage" for
Pfans in the registration area, besides putting up a notice of some kind on
the bulletin board in the hospitality area.  I was also thinking (kind of
reassuring, huh) of possibly trying to organize some sort of "touring"
event for us, if I can find someone familiar with the area to lead us to
some Porsche Roads, maybe for Wednesday or Thursday, with maybe a lunch
stop.  How would that sound?

I plan on leaving Chicago late Friday morning, with arrival in Steamboat
sometime Saturday.  I will probably be working in Registration on Sunday
afternoon and in Tech on Monday afternoon.  I plan to be at the Concours
Monday morning and will be autocrossing in class P9 on Tuesday afternoon.
My next "scheduled" events after that will be the Rallye on Friday, the
Tech Quiz on Saturday morning, and the Worker Party later on Saturday.

Does anyone have access to one of those "button makers"?  I thought that we
might make up something for the Pfans to wear so that we could recognize
each other.  If the "pin" idea doesn't work out, I can always print up some
"mini-labels" to stick on the Parade name badges.

If anyone has any additional suggestions or comments, feel free to contact
me directly or thru the list.
