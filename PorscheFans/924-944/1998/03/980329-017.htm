Well, it's been a crazy week playing with the electrical system
of my car, but I've come to an interesting conclusions. If
anyone's dealt with the electrical work, I would appreciate any
advice. Here's what I can make out:

*) The previous owner thought he was doing something clever by
wiring the radio up to run off the red/white wire coming into
the radio. This meant it would still play even when the ignition
was off.

*) About two weeks ago, the radio just stopped working. Whammo.
The gas consumption gauge, the cigarette lighter and the clock
also went south.

*) After some interesting poking around (3 hours), I discovered
that the cigarette lighter fuse (#11) was burnt out. This took
out the clock even though the clock is listed as working on the
fuse 36. Sigh.

*) After I replaced it, the lighter, the clock and the gauge
started working. The radio still doesn't.

*) In fact, there is some interesting behavior. The red/white
wire shows about 12v until the radio is connected. The load from
the radio drops the wire down to about 1v. The wire must be in
bad shape.

Is there:

1) Any easy way to redo the wire without pulling out all of the
wires from the fuse block? It looks mighty messy.

2) Is there another place to get 12v of power that doesn't run
through the ignition? I don't want to lose the pre-sets of my
radio.

-Peter
