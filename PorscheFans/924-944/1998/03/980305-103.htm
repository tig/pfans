I don't believe the oil pump cavitates.  It just doesn't make any sense that an
automobile manufacturer would design an oil pump that cavitates within the RPM
span of any car they manufacture.  If an oil pump were to cavitate, then no oil
would be pushed through the system and we'd have problems.  The pump would
create it's own little vacuum area and spin uselessly. The 944 pump isn't
moving liquid through vanes, it is carrying liquid on a toothed wheel.

If the 944 oil pump does cavitate, then every 944 owner would have bearing
failure as soon as they hit a certain rpm.  This simply is not the case.

The most logical explanation for bearing failure is air getting sucked into the
oil intake pipe.  Regardless of the cause.  If you have air getting sucked
through the oil pump your going to have problems.  Some immediate if you're at
high RPM.

My rod bearing went in a hard left hand turn at about 5000rpm.  It made a very
loud screeching sound that lasted a second.  Then the car made banging noises
as the piston hit the head due to the out of round condition of the slipped rod
bearing.  I really doubt your could drive too many miles with a spun bearing
without serious engine damage.

I have a suspicion that crankcase pressure had a lot to do with my bearing
spinning.  THe crankcase pressure prevented proper oil drainage to the oil pan
which caused the oil pickup to see air...
