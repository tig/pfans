     Joe, 
     
     If you don't know the last time the fuel filter was changed, I would 
     probably start there.  Fuel filters are notorious for that kind of 
     behavior, and then running once the car has sat for a while and 
     allowed some of the trash to slide back downstream and allow gas 
     through at least for a while.  Being low on gas probably didn't help 
     either, due to the fact that most trash in the tank is at the bottom.  
     When I bought my 944, the first thing I did was change the fuel filter 
     as I have been caught with a clogged one before.  On the way to the 
     shop, the car began hesitating and when I actually pulled in to the 
     shop, the car stalled!  We got it up on the rack and guess what- the 
     fuel filter was clogged-what timing, huh?  Anyway, I'd look to the 
     fuel filter first.  (sorry for rambling)
