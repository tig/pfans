For Jim and all 951 pfans:

Per Jim's request (below) I visited Carlsen in Palo Alto today.  Their Porsche
Tool catalog still shows the KLR diagnostic tool as part number 9246 (order
number 000 721 9246).  My contact at the dealer told me that according to her
Porsche inventory computer, the tools are still available, at a list price of
under $35.  This is somewhat contrary to the information which Jim received
from some other source, as noted below.

The parts department at Carlsen is a very busy place.  If you call, please be
patient, the people there are very friendly and try to help everyone, it is
just sometimes hectic.  They will always try to match or beat a price that you
get from another dealer or aftermarket parts source.  The person I usually buy
from is named Linda, but Mike, Marty or Didi can help as well.  I'm sure that
there are many other dealers that provide the level of pricing and general
service that Carlsen does, but if you don't have such a dealer nearby, try
Carlsen.

Mike,



A while back you gave us the part number of the diagnostic tool.  I called

my local dealer and bugged them until they checked on the tool.  They told

me Porsche no longer carried the tool and referred me to Asbacher

(spelling) a company who makes electronic units.  Asbacher technical told

me they did not know what I was talking about and could find no record of

making the tool for Porsche.



Could you check with your local dealer's parts department (the one that

knows what they are doing) and post if the tool is still available?



Thanks..........



Jim Richmond
