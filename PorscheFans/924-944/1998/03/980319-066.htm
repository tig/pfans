>I would like to repair this or replace the factory headers, but my
mechanic tells me that the replacement cost is $1200, and  that getting
a welder to repair them is a waste of money.  Are there any other
alternatives like aftermarket headers?  I have looked in a few of the
magazines and do not find them.  Has anybody else repaired cracked
factory headers? =

Find another mechanic who doesn't have such a large alimony payment to
make.  Take you car to a performance muffler shop and have them take a lo=
ok
at it.  They should be able to tell you if they can sucessfully weld it o=
r
not.  Pulling the exhaust manifold is no big deal if you remove the exhau=
st
studs.  This is a good DIYS job to get you started on you own repairs.

The reason that you do not find aftermarket headers is that the factory
ones work very well.  However there are some out there if you look.

The factory headers are sucessfully welded all the time.
