Up to my professional neck in the year2000 mess in pharmaceuticals and
healthcare systems, i can add the following:  our chip guru tells us that
processor chips are in danger, especially those prior to mid year 1996.
(When did YOU buy your PC?).  Memory chips should be ok, as are general
logic chips. Think about this:  many hospitals have recently tested their
respirators/infusion pumps/etal and have found they fail. seems many
electonic designs call for built in calibration flags, ie, 'have i been
calabrated since....', and these routines fail when the date goes past 00.
So we should be asking Porsche if there are any true processor chips.  most
chip manufactorers now have websites for chip compliance.  I understand
there are some web sites for "date functions", too, but i think our
firewall has them blocked!
