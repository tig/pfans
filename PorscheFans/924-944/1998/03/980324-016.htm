Ahh! A pattern develops! I've had rollers replaced 3(!) times over the last
year. Every time I had the noise problem and every time it turned out to be
a roller problem. If you have a stethoscope you'll be able to tell easily.
If not, putting a screwdriver on the roller will give you a hint too.

I don't mind the price of the rollers so much - it is the labor involved
that's killing me. 3 $500+ jobs in one year just because of this seems a
little excessive...
