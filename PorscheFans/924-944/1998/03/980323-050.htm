Rodney,

I had the same problem with my 83 944 happen at around 130K. It is not cheap
to have done. Yes, the brake booster will need to come out. What they did on
mine was cut a 1/4" thick steel plate to fit over the damaged part of the
wall, and riveted in loo of welding.

But that's not the end of it. Then, the piston in the clutch master cylinder
needs to be "filed" to prevent the pedal from sticking, since attaching the
reinforcement plate changes the geometry of the pedal travel.

DO NOT attempt to do this without the assistance of an expert mechanic. The
operation cost something over $500, but the clutch has never been more firm.

Note that the pedal will thereafter have longer travel than it does now. This
is the main tradeoff from the fix. But it sure beats scrapping the car!

Good luck, and while the car is in, you might as well have the slave cylinder
changed as well -it shouldn't take long to fail after the master has gone.
