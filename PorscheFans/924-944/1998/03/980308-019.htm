>>Just a note...just my own thoughts, so don't anyone slam me please...if the
list were a little more concise and to the point about situations concerning
the cars, and not someone's "trip to bountiful" and "how you felt the wind
rush through your hair" etc.,....in other words, some articles are so wordy
and the articles really have nothing to do about the 924-944's...there is a
general list for porschefans...I wind up barely skimming the surface of the
list..looking for good solid problems to try to help others.  I wish some
would use the other porschefans general list to spout the rhetoric......just
my thoughts...maybe I am just as guilty as the next guy.<<

Well said. I personally would like to keep it to the point and leave the "Nice
drive through the smokies" or "How I beat a 5.0 Mustang in the twisties"
stories for the general list. 

Isn't this list for 944 specific issues like tech questions or how to's ? The
100+ postings of recent days could easily be distilled to 50 very good
postings.

Just one man's opinion....
