The weather here in Massachusetts is spectacular.  It's going to be 80*F
tomorrow without a cloud in the sky!  However,    my 944 is blasting heat
constantly through the dashboard vents...Removing the sunroof helps, but what
if it rains?

Seriously, Could this be due to my heater control valve sticking in the open
position?  My local shop replaced the valve a month ago,  I think I've had the
problem since then, but did't notice because it was 20*F.  Also, my invoice
says that the part used was a 928 valve, although this might be a typo or
interchangeable part.

Also, a friend mentioned that I could put in a manual bypass valve that I
would simply turn "on" in the winter and "off" in the summer.  He suggested
using a $3.00 brass valve and some clamps from a hardware store.
