Yes. Dont have one.

Part numbers (may be outdated or superceded): early 047 103 353 A or B,
late 80-82 is 047103 353 C. There are enough of em around, why not get
the later head? Several complete engines have been advertised in the
past year for $600 or less, $700 for a turbo. Early head will fit (but
why?)

You could reasonably assume, assuming that was what you paid for as
advertised. Used, assume nothing.

> 5. I'm not going to get rid of the 924, but I am getting interested in a

Apples and oranges. 924, cheap toy. 928, not so cheap toy (relatively
speaking).
