Howdy,

I just got back from my first kart practice session.  WOW!  Talk about a rush.
It's like going flat out down a steep hill with two concrete walls beside
you in fifth gear.  Can you tell I'm a thrill seeker?

Paul and I went out today.  I would have to say that Paul adapted to his
kart faster than I did.  My first session out, I had a loose engine mount
which allows the chain to move around.  In the latter half of my first
session, the chain jumped a few teeth and caused the rear tires to lock
momentarily.  I thought I had caused it, so I drove into the pit and had
my kart re-started.  On exiting the pit, the kart was extremely tail-happy.
Going into the fastest section of the course at WOT (around 50mph), the
chain lets go and jams in the rear gear locking the rear tires solid.  I
did two 360's before finally stopping :)  That was an eye opening 
experience for my first time out.

On my second session, I was pushing a bit more and found that karts can
accelerate quite well in the grass and dirt.  911 owners think their
cars are twitchy, ha!  Every time you step on the throttle, the clutch
takes a moment to engage, then it's HOLD ON FOR DEAR LIFE.  The little
Yamaha motor only produces 14hp @ 10,500rpm.  Paul looked a lot more stable
than me, but then his kart/driver package currently weighs significantly
more than mine.

People who talk about karting don't really tell the whole story.  It's not
the speed that's a big deal, in fact, the speed didn't do anything for
me being used to the 944T and all.  It's the acceleration to that speed
and the g forces that make it something special.  The kart is always
twitching and moving around behind you, very exciting.

On my third session, I decided to push even harder, now paying attention
to cornering lines (we have a coach who is being a great help).  I was
really flying, drifting the kart to the edge of the track and sometimes
dropping a wheel into the grass or dirt.  Paul was really really flying
now.  My coach said a certain section could be taken flat out that I 
was hesitating on, so I decided to go flat through it.  It was damn scarey,
but I made it, so next lap, I went through again and did a light confidence
lift.  Not being happy with that, I tried to go WOT through it again,
but this time I apexed a few feet too early and drifted wider than I 
wanted.  This resulted in one wheel on the dirt in the fastest section of
the course.  Well, I kept my foot into it, but just couldn't pull out and
ended up hitting a wall of dirt designed to stop the kart.  The kart went
up on two wheel and finally came down.  I felt like an idiot, but the 
dude who checked to make sure I was still alive said it was a sweet slide
I pulled :)

If you do drive someone's kart, please be prepared for what's to come,
it totally different than what you expect, you can get seriously hurt
if you are not careful.  I can't wait for tommorow when we do our first
race.  My goal is to just finish the race without crashing.

For those that get ticked when friends talk about un-related stuff on this
list, this is for you:

When the clutch engages on the kart, the sound it makes reminds me of the
exhaust of the 944T when it's at full boost.  You know, that external
wastegate kind of noise.
