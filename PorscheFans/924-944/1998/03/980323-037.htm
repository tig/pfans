Has anyone ever experienced hesitation with a non-turbo 944 that is not only
make the power intermitent, but only occurs  about half the time? I have a
1988 944S and sometimes when I mash the throttle, it takes off real hard
(like it is supposed to). But sometimes through the RPM range of 3000-6000,
it hesitates then comes on strong finally around 6000rpm. It is like the
power is being turned on, off, on, off, on, off, on, off, until 6000
(approx) and then ON!!!! To the casual observer, it feels like "something"
is having to clear out, yet the car is revved freely and quite often. (but
not over-revved)

The distributor cap and rotor are in good shape, I run only 92-octane gas,
the air filter is new (K&N), New Bosch Silver plugs, and I have ran fuel
injector cleaner through several times and the problem still exists.

Are there any other "sensors" (besides O2) or anything that are supposed to
be replaced on a regular basis. The car has 87000 miles and the original O2
sensor. But, I did do the voltage/heat-up/cool-down test on the O2 sensor
and it seemed to work fine. The connector on the O2 sensor is in good shape
as well.

Has anyone had a bad O2 sensor and could describe what it drove like? Did it
hesitate all the time or only sometimes?
I just thought someone might have had a similar experience and found an
easy-to-fix source of the problem.
