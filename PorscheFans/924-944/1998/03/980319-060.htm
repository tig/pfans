Hi All,

Test drove an ultra-clean '89 951 this evening. Quite nice and priced right
also (closer to Bruce's estimates than the Pano ads).

Only odd thing about the car is a script "Turbo" decal applied to the right
front fender, on the flat portion up next to the hood. I have seen the
decal and instructions for replacing same in the shop manual, but I have
never seen one on a car. The car is red and the decal has a silk-screened
effect so that it starts black and then fades away as it flows back along
the fender top.

I thought it would look cheesy but it is well-executed so it looks better
than it sounds.  If any of you have seen one of these decals, please let me
know what you think about it.

Still trying to decide about the car. Will check VIN tomorrow AM. Car had a
APE Stage 2 chipset. Boost gauge showed 2 Bar absolute and the acceleration
was outstanding! Made my un-chipped non-S seem slow! I gotta get me one of
these!

Doug
