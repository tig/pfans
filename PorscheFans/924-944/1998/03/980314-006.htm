Tom Putz as asking for helmet recommendation for autocross....

Tom:
In our region, an SA95 is required for PCA drivers education events. No one
else seemed to mention it but do make sure you meet the toughest
requirements you're likely to encounter. It's such a bummer to miss a great
event just because...

Other than that, it comes down to open vs full and you've gotten good advice
on both fronts. Personally, although I use Bell's M2 full face, I think the
next helmet will be an open face for all the reasons Wes spoke of. Just
depends on your priorities.

Kevlar vs fiberglass I beleive is primarily a cost/weight issue -- costs
more always means weighs less. The more time you spend on the track, the
more you will appreciate not having to fight the heavier helmet's g-forces.
Autocross definately wouldn't matter, DE's would be more significant, and
endurance racing it would be a must.

Lastly, I think the advice to find a local shop and TRY ON the helmets is
very, very good advice. In particular, they can help you understand what IS
a correct fit. Mail order is fine if you know exactly what you want. I
learned this the hard way and had to send helmets back and forth several
times before I was satisfied.
