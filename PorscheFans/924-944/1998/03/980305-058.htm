Rich, You did not get "away with speeding/ blowing a red light".  Because
the fat Five-O didn't see you speeding or running the red.  What you got
was HARASSED for driving a Porsche.  You think jerks so eager to pull you
over would let you go if he saw you speed/red??  

I was driving home from school and into heavy traffic.  2 cop cars were
racing on the lane right of me.  As we approach traffic, one of them cuts
in front of me, forcing the other one to cut behind me.  Apparently the one
who couldn't keep up got pissed and decided to pull me over for Not
Signaling While Changing Lane.  Hello!?!  I never changed lane!  Naturally
I got a ticket from the asshole and naturally my complaint against the
ticket to the judge was denied... Oh, did I mention the asshole swore at me
and called me an wisemouth punk?  Guess why I carry a tape recorder in my
car all the time now.

>>>I guess I should add my own recent experance to the thread. I was comming
home from my girlfriends house late sunday night ... I was crusing up a
local 2 lane highway at about 95 .. zipped up to the light near my block ..
No one (appeared) to be around so I blew the light and made the left .. as I
pulled into the complex parking lot I was hit witht the dreaded lights ..
The "officer" .. gave me the usual license/Reg/Insurance card check ..
looked in the car .. looked around the car .. asked me if my license was
"clean" ... which it was .. he took it back .. checked it and found it was
... came back to me and said .. "I am very surprised THIS license is clean ..
just slow it down .. and have a good night" .. whew .. :) .. I got away with
speeding/ blowing a red light
