Steve,
Fuel pumps normally get noisy when they go bad.  The "silencer" or
fuel accumulator is in the line from the pump to the fuel
distributor.  When you remove the screw at the bottom, if fuel
leaks, it must be replaced.  That's the only test.  Some early 924's
had a small, black, plastic, right angle fuel filter in line between
the tank and the fuel pump, but the '79 didn't.
Regards,
Lee  larchie@lander.edu
