<< A reputable dealer has advised me not to flush and fill my brake fluid
 because the previous owner neglected to do it.  The dealer states that
 he has seen many small problems crop up and thinks that changing the
 fluid will do more harm than good.  I was planning on autocrossing and
 driving it as much as possible.  I would like all my fluids fresh.  The
 brakes work fine.  Any comments?  The car is a 83 944. >>

Just another data point for you.  After having my clutch virtually "stick
itself" to my floorboard my mechanic diagnosed a bad clutch slave cylinder.
He said that if I change my brake fluid at least every two years (every year
is recommended) that I will probably never have to replace either clutch
cylinder again.  The moisture that the brake fluid attracts attacks the
insides of the cylinders and destroys the sealing properties.  You may have to
replace both cylinders at the same time.  I seems that if you replace just one
of them you will probably have trouble with the other in a short time and
since you've torn apart the system anyway . . . . (remember that all surfaces
are being attacked).  Anyway, the difference after replacing both cylinders
and flushing the system was remarkable.

Good Luck,
