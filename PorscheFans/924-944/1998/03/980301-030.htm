A gorgeous weekend in Atlanta.  Sunny and near 70 both days.  The Porsche
is polished to a bright shine and running like a Swiss watch.  What a day
to cruise around downtown Atlanta and Buckhead.  Whats this, I get 2 miles
from the house and the idle is now at 1500 rpm.  Hmmmm, thats strange, it
has never done this before.  I shut off the engine at a stop light and
cranked it back up.  Idle is back around 800 rpm just where it has always
been.  I stopped by work, run in to check on a new system, come back out
and crank up my baby.  Now its not only idling high but it is surging
between 1800 and 1200, almost like clockwork.  At least when a Porsche runs
bad, it does it with precision.

So I'm thinking it has to be the idle stabilizer.  I popped the hood and
tapped it with my fingers trying not to burn myself on the intake manifold.
 Nothing!  I went to the back and got a screw driver and gently tapped the
idle stabilizer with the plastic handle and the car starts to purr like a
kitten.  I drove the rest of the day without incident.

I guess the idle stabilizer is going bad.  From the looks of it I'm also
guessing I'm going to have to remove the intake manifold to get to it.  I
have to say that is a piss-poor place to put the I.S.  Anything else I
should be looking PM wise while I have the intake off?  Any special
precautions about removing the intake?  Anyone recently purchase an I.S.
for a reasonable price (is that an oxy moron - reasonably priced porsche
part).

TIA
