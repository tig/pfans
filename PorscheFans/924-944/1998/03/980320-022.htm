Hello P-Fans
	
I just found out recently that they are two widths of balance shaft belts. A
12mm and a 16mm ballance shaft belts. Each belt has a different tension
setting with the P9208 tool. I do not have the settings though. Right now
Porsche sells both versions, but I would go with the 16mm belt!

Good Luck
