I bought a tow hook from the dealer last Fall.  I painted it red, and took it
to the track  This was Laguna Seca.

In that very first event with the tow hook screwed on, I took my braking too
deep at turn two, and drove into the kitty litter.

I thought I could be Alex Zanardi and tried to keep the wheels moving (the
litter was a little wet), but I was a Formula 1 driver instead.  I sunk down
in, and had to be towed out.  Hook came in handy.

My wife/sponsor/co-driver told me when I was screwing on the hook that
morning: "you know that thing is going to make you go off."

never argue with your wife about such matters.
