Mike,

A while back you gave us the part number of the diagnostic tool.  I calle=
d
my local dealer and bugged them until they checked on the tool.  They tol=
d
me Porsche no longer carried the tool and referred me to Asbacher
(spelling) a company who makes electronic units.  Asbacher technical told=

me they did not know what I was talking about and could find no record of=

making the tool for Porsche.

Could you check with your local dealer's parts department (the one that
knows what they are doing) and post if the tool is still available?

Thanks..........
