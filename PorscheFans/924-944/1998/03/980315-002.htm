Ian Edwardes caused a quote of a UK Daily Mail article to be printed in
which 'motoring organisations' criticised radar detector use. Am I alone
in thinking that motoring organisations like our very own AA and RAC do
not speak on our behalf?

They exist to milk their 'members' for insurance deals, travel deals,
book deals and various roadside recovery/service  deals. THey don't
functions as clubs administered by elected members and run for the
benefit of their members. They are useful for their roadside service
operations but insofar as road safety and driver behaviour matters are
concerned they should shut up. You might as well have Barnes & Noble or
Amazon.com commenting on speeding matters for all the validity that
'motoring organisations' have.

I would wish that these self-appointed sacred cows could find their way
to a butcher's shop.
