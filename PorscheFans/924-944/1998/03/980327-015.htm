As for my neighbouring region of UCR, well, I think they're a great
bunch
of folks and we have never had a problem with their attendance at our
events. One unfortunate aspect of the huge growth in both regions in the
past few years has been the near-impossibility of co-ordinating
schedules,
and thus we haven't seen much of them (nor they us) in the past few
years.

You have to excuse my sense of humor. I hung out with a bunch of them at
the NNJR Watkins Glen event in October. I even 'dined' with them at the
Black Flag Cafe. Their tales of incidents at Mosport don't seem to jibe
with your report so I guess they happened when UCR was running things.

Craig responded:

<<<<<
It bothers a lot of people. I know a number of regions are working on
instruction programs for more than just novices - the idea being to have
some appropriate instruction for intermediate and advanced drivers. An
example of such a program was in excellence a couple of months ago.

I was at that event. It was really quite a letdown. I was expecting
advanced instruction. What I got was the chance to see a few people who
had signed up months ahead of time get rides with two pros. And from the
scuttlebutt one of them wasn't any good as an instructor...

The interesting part was that everyone there was at least an
intermediate with most being instructors. The track was open. If you
weren't working a corner (even the instructors had to work corners
because there were no 'students'), you could go onto the track anytime
you wanted. Since you had a 2 hour working stint, that's 6 hours of
track time! I kept it in moderation and only put 150 track miles on the
car but I bet I could have run 500 before the car melted.

I agree that DE needs to be expanded to provide continuing education for
all the participants.

It sounds like you run good events. I'd love to attend one sometime.
