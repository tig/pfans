The powers that be in F1 banned a whole lot of good stuff for this
season. Which lowered lap times by about 1second if todays race in
Melbourne is anything to go by. In terms of brake technology downgrades,
no fluid cooling of the calipers, only 1 caliper per wheel, and the
caliper itself must be constructed from aluminum and not from some of
the hi tech mmc style alloys of last season.

 ----------

Various constructors have made use of both techniques: pumping water
(coolant) through the caliper, and recirculating and cooling the brake
fluid.  (There was a Nissan GTP car a few years ago that had an extra
radiator mounted on its rear end for the caliper coolant circuit.)  I
don't think anyone is still doing the former.  A lot of race
organizations have banned the second as part of their cost-limiting
programs.  I'm not sure whether F1 allows it.
