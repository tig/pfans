Does this stuff evaporate?  At the end of last summer, I had just changed
my relay for my cooling fans. However, the car overheated and spewed
anti-freeze everywhere.  I managed to clean off the car the best I could.
 Now I have water vapor coming from the engine.  It is ever so slight and
cannot be seen unless it is really cold out.  I looked at the car just
the other day and noticed a little puddle of anti-freeze sitting under
the silver exhaust pipes in some sort of indentation.

Could this be left over AF from the fall that has not evaporated or is
this more than likely a leak?  I drove the car after the overheating and
added anti-freeze until all the air was out of the system and the level
never dropped anymore.  When I do drive the car the level does not seem
to drop.  Any ideas?

I plan on cleaning the engine off now that it is cool and see if another
puddle forms.
