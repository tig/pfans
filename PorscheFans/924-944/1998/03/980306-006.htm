Hi.
I have a really annoying problem on my 83 924, the hatch is leaking and
try as I might I can not fix it.
I have replaced the seal, put gunge over the area inside where it is
coming through but it won't stop. The leak seams to be when water is
sitting on the spoiler, the drains often get blocked as I live and work
in the countryside where little needle fall off the trees and kindly
block my drain holes. But even when they are clear it leaks,. Is it
possible / easy to pull the spoiler off and refit with new gunge to stop
this annoying leak or am I asking for trouble by doing this ?
Richard on your problem with the old bill, report them to the chief of
their area, I had the same problem a few years ago on my bikes in
Brixton. Wrote to the chief super, got an apology and all charges
dropped, which is now framed for the world to see (as I suspected I was
going to be :-).
For whoever was asking GATSO is a horrible speed camera device, which
they hide behind trees etc, even though they aren't supposed to.
