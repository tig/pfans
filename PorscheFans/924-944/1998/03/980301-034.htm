P*Fans,

Today my son and I attended our first SCCA sponsored autocross!  I was
hoping to get Benjamin interested in the finer points of driving.
Needless to say it worked, we are both hooked and looking forward to the
next SCCA event which will take place in Meridian, MS on the 14th & 15th
of this month.  The folks at the one I attended today said there will be
drivers from all over coming to this one, over 200 cars.  I am told that
a fair number from the local Porsche club will be in attendance.  We
were only the second P car there today.  The other was a new 911 driven
by Boo Nobles from Jackson.  We had a blast!  Any of you folks near
Meridian owe it to yourselves to be there on March 14/15.  It will be
held at Key Field, just off I-20 on the west side of Meridian.  Hope to
see you guys & girls there!
