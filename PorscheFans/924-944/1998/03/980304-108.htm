OK, this cat pipe is starting to sound better and better.  Nothing
like another 10 horses or so (fingers crossed) to keep my friend's
pesky Sentra SE-R (with it's new Japanese market turbo motor) in the
rearview.  What's the best place to get this pipe?  I would think that
a mild steel variant would be a better deal than the PowerHaus pipe
because of its high price.  $500 for a two foot pipe with some
flanges?  My car still has the original cat, and with over 100K on the
clock, might be nice to ditch that thing.

Main benifits of removing the car and using a test-pipe:

1). Turbo spools up faster: full boost 500 rpms sooner!!!
2). Throttle response is also better/faster. On throttle transitions
from no
boost to full
      boost, the turbo gauge seems to be more linear in its response
curve.
3). The sound is great! Only slightly loader @WOT. Real throaty and
mello
other times.
4). The exhaust smells - good. lots of Nox and all that good stuff...


PS: my car passed the states emmision test with flying colors!!!
