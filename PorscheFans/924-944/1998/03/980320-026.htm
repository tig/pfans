Hi gang,

I figured as long as the "Awful engine whine" thread was going around, I
would re-post an earlier item which has some bearing on this matter:

>From: "Michel G. Wachholz" <mwachholz@m-c-r-inc.com>
>To: "Porsche 944/968 List (E-mail)" <924-944@PorscheFans.com>
>Subject: Balance belt heads up re:968
>Date: Wed, 7 Jan 1998 10:28:16 -0600

>Dear PFans:
>
>Thought I might give you a heads up on an issue I just became aware of.
>When you replace the balance shaft belt you want to do two things. The
>first being upgrade to the 18 mm wide belt and the second being make
>certain the belt is retensioned approx. 2k miles after it is installed. The
>18 mm upgrade is a wider and stronger belt that has a better history of
>longevity and the lack of retensioning can cause the belt to stretch
>resulting in the belt slipping a cog or two.
>
>This just occurred on my 968 only 5k after the new belt was installed.  My
>mechanic had written on the repair order I was supposed to come in for the
>retension after 2k but I didn't read it/ didn't remember/screwed up. This
>is not something I will do again.  Fortunately, retiming was <$200. and no
>damage was incurred.
>
>After the initial retensioning the belt should be checked for stretchage
>and adjusted according every 10k.
>
>If a slipped belt is left unchecked the resulting additional vibration c
>ould cause serious damage to internal engine parts requiring a rebuild that
>could include in the parts list a new block.  As 968 blocks are not sitting
>in every Porsche parts yard, such a rebuild is typically a $7k - $8k
>proposition.
>
>Just thought you might like to know.
