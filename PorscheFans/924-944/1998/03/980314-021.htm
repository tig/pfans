I just purchased some new wheels and tires for my 1988 944S and had such a
good experience after a bad one, I thought everyone would like a good
referral.

My quest started a month ago. I wanted 17" Borbet C2T wheels for my 944 and
new lower profile tires. (I have always loved the C2 Cup Wheels on the 911
Turbos and RS Americas!) So, I called up The Tire Rack. They took my order
and after two weeks of not receiving it as promised, I called. "It shipped
yesterday" they told me. So I waited another week. I called back again and
now they tell me that the wheels (back ones) and back-ordered a month. I was
@#$%ing mad. I promptly canceled the order and called up Discount Tire
Direct. The sale guy said "yeah sure, I've got 12 sets of those in Arizona
and 15 sets in Ohio. I can have them to you in 3 days"

I originally wanted Bridgestone RE-71's, but they didn't sell them, so the
sales guy them spent 35 minutes on the phone with me going over wheel and
tire combinations that would work on my 944 as well as dimensions and
clearances. 35 minutes!!! To make a long story short, I ended up saving
money, I got my wheels delivered to my door, mounted, balanced, new lug
nuts, new wheel locks, the good kind of stems, and with a lifetime free
replacement warranty on the tires. I put them on my car and it drives like
it is on rails.

I ended up with 17x7.5" rims on the front with Nitto 501 Exit GT 205/45-ZR17
on the front and 17x9" with 255/40-ZR17 on the back. The tires look perfect,
not stretched on and not bulging. The profiles match and perfect clearance
as well.

I can HIGHLY recommend Discount Tire Direct, especially their sales/service
people. If you have questions or a need for wheels and tires, I would tell
you to call the sales guy that helped me. His name is Paul Grabinski at
1-800-790-6444 ext. 422. He knew every wheel that would and wouldn't work
with my offset

I thought the advice may be helpful.
