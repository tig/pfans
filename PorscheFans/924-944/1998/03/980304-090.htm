Denny Voss writes in an earlier post:

>>There was a posting recently asking about the pros and cons of removing the
catalytic converter and I was hoping to see a floodgate of response on this
one. Either I was sleeping or this question died.

I'd like to resurrect it and rephrase it a bit... does replacing the
converter with a cat pipe help richen the fuel mixture and reduce blown head
gasket problems on a turbo?<<

I hear it cures baldness too...

Actually, the removal of a used high mileage catalytic converter and
replacement with a straight pipe is worth almost a 10 horsepower gain on a
chipped turbo. Removal also reduces turbo spool up time considerably. 

Dyno runs:

Farzaan is dead on with his assessment on dyno runs. You MUST be in 4th gear
to get anything close to real world boost pressure on a Dynojet. 3rd gear runs
are fine for NA cars. 

In fact, if I leave my "dyno" banjo bolt on my racecar after a dyno run, I
would be running over 20lbs of boost on the track. I have also tried pinching
the pressure line to the wastegate to approximate real world boost levels
while running 944 turbos on the Dynojet. 

Experience has shown that you can get really impressive dyno numbers (peak hp
and torque) by running high boost and lots of fuel pressure, but there is a
severe downside in drivability and turbo transient response. Even a 300+
horsepower dedicated track car will run faster lap times with more
conservative boost numbers and less fuel than needed for max peak hp.   Don't
ask how I learned this. 

BTW, the Dynojet facility that I use has the Motec Lambda sensor. It is the
only O2 sensor that responds fast enough to really tune the fuel system
accurately. Anyone in the north Orange County (California) area looking for a
great facility with a Dynojet should contact the SHO Shop in Huntington Beach.
Contact me via email for more information.
