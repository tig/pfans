>The trunk lid brake light bulb has gone out on my 1991 944 S2 =
Convertible
>and I have no idea how to replace it.

>anyone?


The brake light on the Cabriolet can be access by (2) 10mm bolts the are =
accessed by gently pulling back the sound deadner on/under the decklid =
(boot for the Brits on the list) under the light housing itself.  They =
are located at each end of the housing.

When removing it, you will notice the housing is one of those "Plastic =
Pig" parts that finally made itself worthwhile.  Yes, that's right, it =
originally came on the Corvette.  The name stamped on it says "GUIDE"  =
which is a name like AC-Delco, Moraine, Harrison, etc. that is used to =
denote ancillary companies that GM owns or owned that built parts for =
the vehicle manufacturing divisions.  GUIDE was the division that made =
lighting devices of all types.  AC stands for Albert Champion of guess =
what fame?

Enough of the drivel.  If I'm not mistaken the light housing was =
installed on the 87-89 model years Corvette which was mounted on the Top =
bar behind the T-Tops in front of the hinge rear glass.=20
=20
The individual bulbs in the housing can be replaced by pulling on the =
bulb itself.  What you might find is that there is rust on the contacts =
and cleaning the contact points and filament wires might bring them back =
to life. If not try the local GM dealer, I'm sure the would like some =
class on their lot.

Clean the gasket and housing area before replacing. I put a little bit =
of Vaseline of the gasket to help stop water leaks. Don't tighten bolts =
to much as the housing is fragile and can make the gasket creep out when =
tightening down.

Good luck.
