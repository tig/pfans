Well guys,girls, 

I was looking for some bits and ends to fix my hatch cover, found the 
end caps at the dealer, and was frantic looking for the end knobs - 
that's how I call it - to finish the repair. Gave a call to my buds at 
PAP in Atlanta and one of the guys, David, told me to come by and take  
a look in the back of the house in some of the cars... Man how bad I 
felt in seeing all those beauties wrecked.. Gorgeous 951, black, several 
944 most red and quite a few 924 were over there in the final rest. Of 
course I don't complain much 'cause I can find some donnors for my car 
but it still a sad scene. By the way, I was pretty happy to see that Joe 
Cogbil, the owner, is now running a 924S on SCCA instead of the TUB.. 
356, and believe me the car looks really hot and I had the chance to 
take a quick peak at the car...
Anyway, hope you guys have a nice week end and take care of those babies 
out there...

Adrien
