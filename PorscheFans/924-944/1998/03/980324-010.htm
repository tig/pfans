Smart move.  You can get burned buying a poorly maintained or retrofitted 931.

Beware that there are a number of variants of the 931 for 1980, and I think
1981 also.  Some have 4-wheel disk brakes, some don't.  The 1980 model has
a Porsche transaxle with an unusual shift pattern while the 1981 has an
Audi transaxle with the conventional shift pattern.  Which is better, is a 
religious argument.  In 1981, the ignition system was changed to use a crank 
position sensor, but it still has a distributor.  The compression ratio was 
also upped by 0.5 to 1, but this can actually limit your choices for upgrading 
power.  See below.

I can attest that the wrong tires on a 931 will haunt you all the way down to
the wear bars.  Wide tires without wide rims is a mistake.

Don't know about 16" and 17" applications, but 215/60 is as large as you
should go with the 15" tire.  I've found that with the stock 15" rims, 205/60s
work pretty well, but the size means less than the brand (and construction) 
of the tire.  Regarding the speedo, the car was originally fitted with just
about the largest radius tire the wheel wells will accept.  Unless you're 
wanting to use low profile tires on the 15" rim, speedo tuning should not be
much of an issue.  With low profile tires on 15" rims, you should worry about
leaving bits of your car on speed bumps.

>What about the width of the wheel?  The car comes stock with 15x6 inch
>wheels, right?  From what I have seen a you can't buy tires for a 16 or
>17" wheel that are only 6 inches wide, so I would have to go to at least
>7 inches probably 8".

Any tire width greater than 215 might interfere with the fender unless they
are flared, in which case, you should have just gotten a 944/951.

>My other questions have to do with increasing the horsepower of the car.

>The 931 was not intercooled, correct?  That is one upgrade that I am

>does any company make a kit for it, and would the intercooler of a 944T

There were a few 931s made with intercoolers, but they are quite rare.
I believe some members of this list have installed 951 intercoolers on their
931s, but some modifications to the radiator are required.

>I also saw an ad in European Car once for a company that sells complete

>headers for a 924 T?

I don't know of any aftermarket headers, as this is a turbo application with
only about 10,000 copies ever made.  The exhaust system is VERY expensive to 
replace with factory spec parts, but mine has never needed replacing.

>Are there any other modifications that are people would recommend to
>increase the power of a 924 T?

Here's the big advice I can offer on power.  In the U.S. where auto emissions 
testing is conducted, the 1980 model has a big advantage over the 1981.  1980
models are allowed higher CO emissions, something like 2.0% instead of 1.0%.
This allows the car to pass inspection without a catalytic converter.  The law
still requires the cat to be installed, but you can remove the guts to the 
factory cat and still pass inspection as long as the fuel injection and ignition
systems are in tune.  This reduces exhaust back pressure and makes the turbo 
work better.  The 1980 also has 7.5-to-1 compression ratio rather than 8.0, so
you can raise the turbo boost to 14 psi without blowing head gaskets or worse.
No intercooler is required.  All you need is a 14 psi spring in the stock 
wastegate, a $40 item.  Mine runs full boost on 87 octane without pinging as
long as the full throttle enrichment switch is enabled.  I usually run 89 or 93 
octane, just for $2 per tank insurance.

In general, all 931s are neat cars if you intend to turn wrenches on a regular
basis.  They will often run for a long time without attention, but not as well 
as they could.  Most self-performed repairs are not too expensive as Audi and 
VW parts are used just about everywhere they can be without dire consequences.  
Just make sure you shop around and don't simply ask for a $40 Porsche wheel 
bearing when the $20 Audi bearing and the $10 VW bearing are actually the same 
part.  And finally, when you are looking over a prospective buy and find a lot
of non-standard parts like fuel filters that don't fit where they should or
Western-Auto-Zone in-line fuel pumps, RUN AWAY!  It's amazing how many 924s
(and even a few 931s) look like cars in that "Road Warrior" movie, and the 
owners still insist they are driving a Porsche.

Good luck.
