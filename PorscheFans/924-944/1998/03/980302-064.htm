Unless the PO had used silicon fluid, do it! 

The problems that pop up are the master cyn. can develop a leak when you
pump it a lot. But boy you are asking for problem when you run with 15 year
old brake fluid.

What I would do is do a gravity bleed of the system. That's when you open
all the bleeders and let nature pull the old stuff through. 

The right color of brake fluid is dependent on the type used, most DOT-4
types are clear, ATE makes both a blue and Gold version. If your fluid looks
brown it is worth sh--, and you should get it out of there.

Steps are:

1.	Use a turkey baster to pull all the old fluid out of reservoir
2.	Clean out as much of the dirt with a soft clean rag inside the
reservoir 
3.	Make sure you have no lint in reservoir
4.	Fill the reservoir with a good DOT -4 fluid (DO not use junk brands)
5.	Now starting at right rear open the bleeder a bit and let the old
fluid drain into a clear jar (Use a clear tube to keep it from going
everywhere)
6.	Keep adding fluid to reservoir and drain until the fluid coming out
looks like the new fluid.( I use ATE Supper blue)
7.	Now close that bleeder and go to the other side and repeat.
8.	Next is Right front
9.	Last is Left Front

If you did it right your lines will be full of fresh brake fluid, and now
you can do a peddled driven bleed, without much exposure to error.

Remember that the clutch should be bleed also.

Dan

	Hello Folks

	A reputable dealer has advised me not to flush and fill my brake
fluid
	because the previous owner neglected to do it.  The dealer states
that
	he has seen many small problems crop up and thinks that changing the
	fluid will do more harm than good.  I was planning on autocrossing
and
	driving it as much as possible.  I would like all my fluids fresh.
The
	brakes work fine.  Any comments?  The car is a 83 944.
