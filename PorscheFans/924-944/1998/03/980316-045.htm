>Yesterday afternoon, I started my car (87 951) and found that I could

>wheels were not turning.  I tried a couple of times and then the
>wheels starting turning and the sounds went away.  I shut off the car
>and popped the hood.  The power steering fluid reservoir had bubbles
>in the fluid, but was still just above the low mark.  I went ahead and

>have replaced every part of the front suspension/steering in the last

>
>My question is, is there a new (rebuilt) steering rack in my immediate

Hello Clark & P-Fans,
=09Check your PS hoses for leaks. One of them is probably the culprit. Lo=
ts of=0Atimes the hose clamps at the base of the PS reservoir leak, try r=
eplacing the=0Aclamps. Also pull back or squeeze the steering rack bellow=
s, se if any PS=0Afluid leaks out? There is also a O-Ring for the PS rese=
rvoir screw/cap, make=0Asure the fluid is not getting sprayed out there. 
=09As for the wondering problem, jack up the front end and check the tops=
 of the=0Astrut-bearings or mount for looseness. Its the rubber top on th=
e tops of the=0Afenders under the hood. Jim Pasha in the May =9198 Excell=
ence issue, recommends=0Athe =9197 and latter 951 strut bearing tops (par=
t#951-343-018-013) for less=0Adeflection better performance or the camber=
-ball types aftermarket ones. 

Good Luck
