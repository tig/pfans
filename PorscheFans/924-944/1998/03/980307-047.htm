<< For about a week the clutch pedal in my '87 924S had been acting strange.
If the car hadn't been driven for a couple of hours (ie before I went to work,
and before I went home) the pedal would stick on the way up.  I'd press the
pedal to the floor, and on the way up it would stick a little at about the
halfway point for 1/2 a second, but then find its way up.  I'd just pump the
pedal three or four times before starting the car, and everything was fine.

I'm prepared for the worst, but I'm wondering if anybody has a good guess of
what might be wrong based on what I've told you. >>

Reg,

Chances are it's the master cylinder or the clutch slave cylinder.  Your best
bet (assuming you don't want to have to do things over real soon) is to
replace both cylinders and flush the system (including the brake fluid).
After that, make sure you flush both brake and clutch hydraulic fluid every
one or two years and you'll probably never have to replace the cylinders
again.

Hope this helps,
