GEICO is constantly getting written up in enthusiast magazines for being the
scum of the insurance companies, doing things like not paying claims that there
insurees are at fault on, etc. They also spend a lot of money buying RADAR and
LASER equipment for police forces (makes them able to write more tickets, which
allows GEICO to raise it's customers rates for getting tickets). They also
won't insure anyone who uses a RADAR detector (this at least used to be the
case, since I got turned down by them because of it).

I'm just glad I live in Texas where it's illegal for an insurance company to
raise your rates because of tickets, they can cancel you, but they can't raise
your rates.
