>>I find this whole thread on timing belts to be pretty humorous. First of
all, that $500 tool is far from a precision measuring device. Secondly,
having been a mechanic for a number of years I can guarantee you the majority
of the mechanics you're paying $80/hr to work on your car don't take the time
to properly use it. It's just a timing belt. If it's too tight it will trash
the
bearings on the water pump or the idlers and make lots of noise. If it's too
loose 
it will flap around, make noise, and perhaps jump time at high RPMS
(really loose). 
It's not going to catastrophically fail because it's 20% out of the
factory spec. 
Let's let this subject die as it's obvious consensus is not going to happen in
this forum.>>

Thanks to Jim for finally putting this issue in perspective. It's just a
timing belt. Why do you think Porsche went to the convenient spring type self
tensioner on the late cars?  Certainly not for more accuracy. 

Tool 9208 is not infallible and is more likely to be used improperly then used
correctly. The position of the tool in relation to the rollers will have an
affect on the reading as well as upside down vs. rightside up placement, and
even crankshaft position.  When the measurement is taken and the user "cocks"
the tool, it is very easy to influence the tel-tail to a higher than actual
reading. 

The only thing special about the 944 timing system is that Porsche's original
design sucked, and was later updated. Let's put this annoying thread to sleep.

BFG R's

I have run these on my 2700lb GT-2S 951 for over 5 years. I currently run
275's in front and 315's on the rear. I also run in the extreme temperatures
we have here in the California desert (Willow Springs International Raceway). 

Per BFG recommendations, I look for temps in the 180-190 range, and pressure
increases in the 9-11 psi range. My fronts start at 25-26 cold and the rears
start as low as 23-24. I heat cycle my tires at least 24hrs before an event,
and I try to avoid starting a unshaved BFG tire on the front "cornering"
position.  While these tires are definitely not the fastest DOT R compound
tires out there, I get good wear and competitive performance from them.  In my
neck of the woods, the short lived Hoosiers are the tire to beat. 
 
IMHO, David Jalai is right on the mark regarding Jon Milledge.
