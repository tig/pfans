**********************************************************************************************************************************************To those interested in subwoofers for their Porsche, 

  I have been developing a custom subwoofer system for our '86 944 and I 
am now considering turning this system into a product. I have been 
interested in audio for some time and have a dream of starting a 
business of my own. Before I approach this endeavor more seriously, I 
want to find out if there is enough interest for such products. Since I 
have seen several postings on this topic lately, I thought now would be 
as good a time as any to ask all of you great folks if you are 
interested. 

  First a little background information about myself. I am an electrical 
engineer currently working for a large semiconductor company. I have had 
an interest in audio for many years, and have designed and constructed 
many audio projects ranging from speakers and subwoofers (including a 
accelerometer based subwoofer similar to that sold by Velodyne) to 
active crossovers, audio amps, etc.. When my wife and I purchased our 
944 at the end of 1996, I knew I had to design a quality audio system to 
match the quality of the automobile. Since then, I have been developing 
the system in my "spare" time (yeah, right, spare time, wish I had 
some)..

  Being the "foundation" of an audio system, in my opinion, an 
automotive subwoofer system should at least have the following 
characteristics:
  o linear frequency (and phase) response extending to the 
    lowest audible frequency (not that BOOMY sound)
  o low distortion
  o the capability of providing enough acoustical energy to 
    really be felt (but not cause hearing damage or heart arrhythmia)
  o ease of installation and integration with an existing system
    with slight if any modification to the vehicle (i.e., can be 
    installed by the owner in a reasonable amount of time with 
    simple tools)
  o reasonably priced, compact, built to last, integrates with 
    vehicle, looks good, etc.... 

Every system has to compromise various characteristics. I prefer to 
trade off that loud boomy distorted sound which causes listener fatigue 
for a cleaner more controlled and accurate sound. Hey, that is why I 
drive a Porsche instead of, well, I don't want to offend anyone.. So, to 
satisfy these desirable characteristics, I have been developing a 
complete subwoofer system specific to the 944 line which includes the 
following components:

Electronic control module with:
  o Active low pass for the subwoofer
  o selectable Active high pass for the subwoofer to remove low 
    frequency rumble (frequencies below the audible hearing range)
  o Frequency response shaping to equalize the frequency response 
    (think of this as several parametric equalizers tuned to the car)
  o Active high pass matched to the above for other speakers in the car
  o protection circuitry
  o remote digital volume control for subwoofer level
  o and more as needed, perhaps as plug in upgrades
  
Custom Class-D digital Amplifier (Option for customer to use 
                                  their own Amplifier)
  o High efficiency so less power is consumed
  o neat solution to reduce the size of power wires running 
    from the front to rear of the car
  o lightweight and small, doesn't need much cooling
  o scaleable to the size and number of subwoofer drivers in the system

Subwoofer module (currently a 10" unit, other sizes to be offered)
  o mounts in rear cubby hole with high quality wood or plastic 
    hardware (or removable enclosure)
  o Large Xmax (throw of driver) for higher output
  o out of site when in cubby hole
  o and more!!

  Using a PC based acoustical measurement program I wrote in Matlab (I 
send a SINC signal into the system under test, and take the FFT of the 
output) I have been characterizing and tweaking the acoustics of my 
prototype (and of course, lots of listening to verify the measurements). 
With my prototype, the response doesn't start to fall of until ~10Hz 
with really powerfull output! I will limit the low frequency range in 
the final product for increased power handling, but even with the 
response extended to 10Hz, it produces enough acoustical output for my 
bass hungry appetite! If I do get this business rolling, I have lots of 
ideas for the remainder of the audio chain. Oh, and unique solutions for 
the rest of the 944 family, 911 family, etc...

  Sorry to take up so much bandwidth, hope you folks don't mind.

Thanks for any feedback you can give me. If there is interest, I will 
start a web site to provide more info.

Please respond to ehall@together.net, not my work account which I 
normally post from
