Ole,

Among college and even high school students its not uncommon to see people
drinking and driving.  At that age you think your invincible.  I'm sorry to
say but I did it.  Little older, little wiser now.  Anytime I go out now
(being in my late 20's) someone always gets selected to be designated
driver.  I think about some of the stupid things I did and its a wonder I'm
still alive or didn't hurt someone along the way.  

I would have to say it had nothing to do with where you were at, just the
age of people you were around.  Fortunately, I think the younger crowd is
starting to realize the dangers of driving under the influence.  You'll
always have the group though that thinks they can do anything without
consequences.

Just my opinion,
