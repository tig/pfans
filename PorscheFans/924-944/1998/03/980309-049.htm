It seems that nobody reads their PorscheFans over the weekend?  I had a
question that I posted on I think Friday night.  I didn't get much of a
response.  Maybe I can get more help on a weekday?  Here is my question...

I inspected my sunroof today.  I found that all the fuses are good, the relays
are working, the micro-switch works, the console switch works.  I took the
carpeting away from the sunroof motor so I can look at it while I press the
switch.  I saw and heard that the motor looks like it is trying to turn but
isnt doing it.  The manual operation crank twitches when I press the switch in
either direction.  The motor hums.  I then took the motor assembly somewhat
apart and saw that the motor turns fine when it isnt under pressure.  If the
problem were stripped plastic gears wouldn't I hear the gears slipping?  I
heard some talk about a clutch for the sunroof motor.  Could this be the
problem?  How do I fix this?    Thanks!!
