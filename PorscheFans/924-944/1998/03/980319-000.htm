P-fans,

There's been a lot of talk lately on what's the best tire for newbies, old
fogies, street use, auto-x, etc.  Well, I just thought I'd throw in my $.02 to
give another data point.  I last ran Yoko AVS Intermediates . . . . . good
tires, nothing bad to say about them.  Since they were down to the wear bars I
thought I'd try something new.  As I said in the title, don't laugh at my
tires.

I went to see an aquaintance who owns a local Big-O tire store and he talked
me into trying a set of Big-O brand Euro DXP tires.  He said they are built
for Big-O by the BFG Comp T/A people.  By the way, they are an asymmetrical
tread design and they are Z-rated.  They're not cheap ( a little over $450.00
for the set) but they really stick to the road . . . . . much better than the
Yokos ever did.  The additional "selling point" is that Big-O offers free
mounting, balancing, valve stems, rotation, flat repairs and a road-hazard
protection program that includes replacement if the tire is non-repairable
while it still has legal tread.  The guy also does a super job in wheel
balancing.  I thought my other tires were good but these run straight and true
like the car is on rails . . . . . . it's really a good feeling when things
come together!  I asked him where he learned to balance tires and it turns out
that he road races a Z-28 Camaro.  OK, so it's not a Porsche but he still goes
fast!

I have no interest in these tires other than I'm a very please customer.
