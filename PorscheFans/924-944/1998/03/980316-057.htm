This will be my last installment of the kart stuff.  There was an overwhelming
response to my first post, so I thought I'd give it a conclusion.

Part II: Our first race day.
----------------------------
We're heading down to Cultus Lake, it's pouring rain out.  I'm exhausted from
the day before and am looking forward to sleeping on the ride down.  If you've
never been passenger in Sam O's van, you have no idea what kind of grip these
things have.  At first, going into decreasing radius corners at full throttle
had me a bit scared, but after a while, I've become accustomed to Sam O's
driving style.  Let the record state, I would not want to challenge this guy
to a street race through twisty roads, even if I had the 944 and he had the
van!

We arrive at the track and it's still pouring out.  We walk around a bit, take
a look at the track, etc.  I'm thinking that we are likely heading home
soon.  
Sam O' goes to the trailer and opens the door.  "Ok, get your suits on, I'm
going to torture you a bit."  

"But Sam, we only have slicks and it's pissing out there", I said.

"Yeah, so?  That's the torture part, now get your suits on", he replied.

So, being the students, we listened to the teacher and got our suits on and
went out in pouring rain with slicks on.  Now that is an experience I won't 
soon forget.  The kart is bobbing side to side slithering at the slightest
hint 
of throttle application.  Going down the straight, the kart does not want to 
stay straight; first, the back end is flying around, then you hit about 3/4
way 
down the straight, and the front end starts to float on the water, then you 
have to brake hard for a left hand sweeper, very interesting.  You can't just
coast either, or you'll get passed like your standing still.

In our first pre-race practice session, I was actually having a good time.
I've always enjoyed rain driving and being on slicks wasn't that bad
afterall, as long as you stayed off the puddles.  I actually managed to
pass two people during this session.  Paul was struggling a bit with
braking in the rain.  I managed to catch him and was being held up by him.
We both came down the back straight, Paul got on the brakes about 8-10ft
earlier than I had planned.  In my attempt to not rear-end him, I locked up
the rear tires and stalled the motor.  My session was over.

In the first heat race, Paul had figured out what he was doing wrong in the
morning and was very fast.  I was ahead of Paul, but my kart wasn't feeling
very good.  The kart just wouldn't come out of the corners.  It was bogging
badly.  I got the blue flag to let Paul by.  I was not happy to have gotten
the blue flag, especially since I had been pretty quick in the morning.  I
started to push harder, but it all came to nothing when my kart stalled
under power in the slower sections.  I had fouled my plug in the extended
warm-up laps.  The water in the air box didn't help the plug either.  Paul
went on to finish in 6th out of 7 cars.

In the second heat race, my kart was back to normal and I was flying.  Paul
was also flying.  This time, he started ahead of me, but I got left behind
on the start laps as I was waiting for the guys that were supposed to be
ahead of me get into grid. They took about 3/4 of a lap to catch up, which
meant I was 3/4 lap down on Paul right off the start.  I was driving my
butt off trying to catch Paul and the leading pack.  I managed to pass the
two that had held me up at the start.  I drove hard and fast to come about
1/4 lap away from Paul now, but I threw it all away.  Coming out of the
front straight, I went too deep under braking and put the kart backwards
into the dirt berm.  I held the throttle wide open in hopes of pulling out
and continuing my challenge, but the tires just sat there spinning with
dirt flying out.  I felt like Schumacher at Jerez.

The feeling you get when sitting at the side of the track watching your
competitors driving by is hard to describe.  You feel like such an idiot.
You feel like taking off your steering wheel and throwing it somewhere.  I
even banged my helmet against my seat, I was so ticked off.  Paul went on
to finish in 2nd place, which was very good.  There were three seniors in
the session and four novices.  One of the seniors had spun off, the other
had mechanical problems, but Paul was always close by, never letting them
out of his site.  The only glitch in Paul's strong finish was a spin on the
last corner of the last lap, but he kept it going to still finish 2nd.

The last race called the Final Race is the one that counts.  The first two
determine your grid order.  Since I DNF'ed both sessions, I was basically
put into dead last. Paul was first of the novices in 4th place.  The
session started and we were in a tight pack this time.  I wasn't going to
let the two backmarkers hold me up this time. I'm not sure what happened,
but I found myself on Paul's rear in the first corner. I had managed to get
into 5th right off the bat.  The track was now drying and my lines had
improved a lot since the first day, so I was hoping to do well.  I found
myself backing off so as not to rear-end Paul.  Since I have a major weight
advantage right now, I was planning to pass Paul on the 2nd lap once the
tires had come up to temps and he'd settled down a bit.  Coming down the
back straight, I jumped on the
brakes, but noticed that Paul was still going for it.  Unfortunately for
Paul, his race ended in the gravel trap as he was not able to turn the kart
in to make the corner.

I continued to fight with the three seniors, being about 1-2 seconds behind
them.  Coming into the slow section, I got stuck behind a back marker that
held me up for two corners until I got around him.  I was now about 5
seconds behind the front runners.  I pushed like hell and was catching them
slowly, but surely.  I ended up having to lap another of the novices, but
this time it was much smoother as it was down the straight.  Around the
10th lap, I was starting to feel a bit fatigued, my kart was driving me
rather than me driving it.  Sam O' said I was starting to look a bit ragged
out there, with the kart really twitching.  On the last lap, on the last
corner, I saw the chequered flag and outbraked myself.  Thankfully, I did
an all-or-nothing move.  I turned the wheel and floored it hoping the
oversteer would turn the kart in and it did, but what a scarey moment.  I
thought I was going to join Paul in the dirt trap.  If I had done that, Sam
O' would have been very, very mad.  

I ended up finishing my first race in 3rd place out of seven karts.  One
ahead and one behind me went off, I lapped a novie guy and I passed one of
the senior guys to get that result.  While the 3rd looks good, I've still
got a lot to learn.  As it currently stands, Paul is a bit quicker than me
in the dry and I'm a bit quicker in the wet, but with my weight advantage,
I should be quicker in all conditions.

Next week, we head over to Tradex for our first practice day there.  There
should be a lot more competition there and a higher level of competition to
aim towards.

All in all, we had a fantastic weekend.  We raced in the dry, the wet and
the wet/dry.  I hope that you have enjoyed these recollections of our first
experience of karting.
