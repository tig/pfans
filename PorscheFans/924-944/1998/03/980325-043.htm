In '89-90 standard Blaupunkt units started shipping out with an
anti-theft code. Your unit's face-plate will usually say this, and also
(usually) have an LED that starts blinking when the ignition is turned
off. With these units if the permanent +12v connection (pink wire) is
ever broken (changing battery, uninstalling stereo, adding amplifier
etc.) the display shows "no code" and will not operate. With the Newport
unit in my S2, you use the radio preset buttons 1 through 4 to punch in
the 4-digit code and then hit one of the other preset buttons to start
the unit up. It only lets you enter the code for the first 10 seconds
after turning the stereo on, after which you have to turn the key off,
wait and try again.

I found the radio code on a sticky in the glove box, and on the back of
the owner's manual. I think this is a stupid theft-deterrent and a pain
in the neck, because I seriously doubt that the guy that wants to bash
in my window with a crowbar will have eyesight good enough to read
"anti-theft" on the stereo or IQ high enough to interpret that before he
rips it out and runs. And once the unit is stolen I couldn't care less
if the unit is useable or not, in fact one less item in the landfills if
it is useable.
