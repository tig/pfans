>>The problem is I'm somewhat confused and I need to narrow my search down
to specific models and years. Can anybody >>help me sort out which years
and models of 944's are most desirable and which ones to avoid. I think I'm
looking for >>something like an '87 944S but I don't know if the few extra
bucks for a good "S" model are worth it. Is the 16 valve engine a >>better
power plant or what? I'm probably not interested in a turbo so looking at
only 944S's is kind of limiting (fewer of them, >>fewer years in
production, etc.) so do I need to consider regular 944's or stick to the
"S" model. 

At the risk of starting a flame war, don't rule out the turbo :-)

When I started looking for a 944, I decided I definitely didn't want a used
turbocharged car.  But when I drove one, the decision was basically made.
They don't cost much more than a good S model and none of the maintenance
work I've done has been related to the turbo.  All of the mechanics that
I've talked to have said that the turbocharger itself it bulletproof as
long as the car is taken care of.

Having said that, I don't suggest that you buy a turbo.  For my driving
(mixed street/freeway, LOVE THOSE ONRAMPS), I like the standard turbo.  For
high speed driving, the Turbo S may be better.  But, for low speed grunt,
it seems like the S/S2 may be the way to go.
