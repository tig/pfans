I have to get this off my chest.. 
The daily entries to the digest are fast approaching 100 and it is
getting harder and harder to sift thru the info. I joined the digest to
get tech info on my car but now find that more and more space is being
taken up by people wishing to talk about their racing exploits/setups.
This can be very interesting but also space/time consuming.

Why not use racing@porschefans.com instead. This is very underutilised
(approx 15 entries per day). Perhaps it should be renamed
competition@Porschefans.com.

My car is my daily driver and although I occasionally use it in AX or
sprints, I am more interested in tech info regarding problems with the
car than knowing whether R1's are better than hoosiers or the amount of
gear ratios and brake pads I can use. They seem to come up as recurring
themes all the time and are not really pertinent to the street car.

There, I feel better now!!!
