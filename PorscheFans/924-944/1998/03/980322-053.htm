I will post this now, as I get ready to start poking around. Just tried to
start my 924S, and it ran badly for about two seconds, during which I noticed
the temp guage bouncing around wildly and who knows what else. Now when I turn
the key, even before the starting position, the fuel pumps run, the
instruments come on, but the oil pressure guage pegs out at maximum, the
warning lights glow very faintly and nothing else happens when I go into the
start position. The last couple times I started it during the day it took a
couple seconds to fire up, which is not normal. I am especially surprised by
the fuel pumps running when they should not be, so I will start by having a
look at their relay. I can not remember what triggers them to go, but I
thought it was the dme upon sensing engine rotation from the senders at the
flywheel. I got a bad feeling about this. Voltage guage shows 12 good volts,
all accessories seem to be working normally. Any thoughts? Scary for stuff
like this to happen with minimal warning. Glad the car is sitting in my
driveway though. - Frenna@aol.com
