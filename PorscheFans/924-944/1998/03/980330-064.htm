Two thumbs up for the dash repair covers.  I installed mine about 5 years ago
and have been very pleased with it.  I think I purchased it from Performance
Products, but the one from Tweeks may be the same thing.  The texture of the
PVC is similar to that of a leather product.  Take your time with the install,
paying particular attention to initial fit and trimming ( yes, a small amount
of filing or sanding of the edges is necessary for the perfect fit ).  Dry fit
the cover over the dash until you are 100% satisfied with the fit before
applying the silicone sealant.  I can't speak to the issue of colors as my
dash is black.  Tape down the covers edges and use weights and wedges as
necessary to hold down the cover until the sealant is thoroughly dry. Your
patience will be rewarded in a nicely fitting, professional looking dash.

Hope this information is helpful to you.
