Hello list Gurus
I have a question on water pumps as I am now in need of one.
I have an 'old' style pump (no belt guard) and I am going to replace it. I
have checked with Europroducts, PAR, Zims and Vertex and got some
interesting replies.
Zims says not to bother upgrading to the new type as there is no difference
and they will not except an old pump core for a new pump purchase. The
others will take the old core for new pump. All say that there rebuilder is
great. (what a surprise) I already have the new style roller for the
upgrade.
Questions
Is there a 'real' difference in the operation of the old and new pumps?
Any input on which outfit has the better quality rebuilds?
And a question on balance shafts-
With the belt off I can feel a different resistance to rotation for the two
shafts. One shaft will always rotate (with the aid of gravity) to weight
side down the other shaft just stops at whatever position it is in when you
let go and will not continue to rotate to find weight side down. Is this a
problem?
