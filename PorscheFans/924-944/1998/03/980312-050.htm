Lee,
    In the case of the 944 oil pump (if my memory serves correct), the 
surfaces I cleaned were made of a hard metal with circumferential grooves that 
look to have been created when the parts were produced (perhaps on a lathe). 
Also, the thickness of the loctite 574 which I removed was far greater than 
any slight scratches I may have imposed on the surface with the razor blades, 
and certainly thicker than the grooves in the part. Good point though, razor 
blades can do damage if not used very carefully, especially on soft metals 
such as Al which our engines are mostly made of. Obviously, use of a solvent 
would be best.

Thanks,
 Ezra
