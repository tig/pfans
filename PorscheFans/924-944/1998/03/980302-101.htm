Hi Pfans,

  Thanks to all (Doug, John, Menelaos, Nick, Surya) who replied 
to my email about the overheating 944.

A new thermostat (71C rating) fixed the overheating problem, the 
needle rarely strays above the first mark ! I would like to 
reiterate their exhortations to bleed the cooling system right ! 
It's not as easy as it seems the first time but once you get the
hang of it ....

Automotion has a new tool to remove/install  snap rings. It is in
their latest catalog (Pg 166, arrived last week) which costs $24 as 
opposed to the $45 tool they carried earlier (and as reported in 
the FAQ). It has a screw which allows you to set the separation 
between the prongs (0.9in worked well) making the removal process 
quite painless. Except for disconnecting the radiator hose (lower end) 
I was able to do it all from above (helps to have the lights up). Haynes 
gave the impression that it is to be done from below (didn't relish the
idea of coolant dripping on me when I pull out the snap ring/thermostat).

Now if I can only figure out the little oil leak.
