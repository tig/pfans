My car's intermittant wiper has not been working ever since I got the thing.
Last weekend I decided to get serious about fixing it.
The symptom was no intermittant wiper. The relay wasn't making any noise
at all so I assumed that there was no current getting to it.
(this is a bit of an assumption!)
I couldn't wok out whether the switch was faulty so I took it out.
This is not that difficult (on an 84). The steering wheel just "pops"
off no problem (non-airbag). The switch gear is easy enough to slide
off (after taking out the top and bottom plastic covers) but the headlight
high beam connector is quite tricky.
Anyway the switch tested out fine with my multimeter so I was
a little stumped, so I went out to the car. Having the haynes wiring
diagram helped a little. I turned on the key so that the wipers were energised
and connected a little wire between the two terminals that trigger the
intermittant wipers. (I think green and green/black) and presto intermittant
wipers! The problem was that the little metal connector inside the plastic
multi-connector had been bent in such a way that I just wasn't making contact
on the green wire! Easy fix just bend the contact a little in the multi-plug
and all fixed. This is the second time I've found this problem on this car
so I'd say it's definiately something to look out for!
Now if only I can fix the rear wiper park then that'll be everything!
PS I also fixed the washer by cleaning the contact with a little emory
paper although this can be done without dismatling anything by poking
stiff paper through the gap between the stalk and the plastic shroud.
PS. If anyone can help me with the rear wiper I need to know...
1) how are the wires connected ie which colour to which pin?
2) what current should come throught each wire ie. which is earth, switch
and always hot.
3) where the wiring harness goes? (I think there may be a break somewhere)
Oh, the wiper (rear) works fine but will not park, it just stops mid sweep
when you switch it off.
