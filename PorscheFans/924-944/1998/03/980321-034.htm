<< Assuming that tires are tires and balancing is balancing, Could it be
 something as simple as rubber V. steel valve stems? >>

Ah, there's the rub.  Tires are not tires and balancing is not balancing.  In
other words, everything else is NOT equal.  All tires are not round (don't
even think they are) and there are more ways to balance tires (and more ways
to mis-balance them) than there are teeth in your balance shaft belt.  The
real trick is finding someone who really knows what they're doing and how to
do it!

It's funny. . . . .  just after I got my new tires balanced someone must've
come by and fixed all the lousy roads I drive on because they sure are alot
smoother now!
