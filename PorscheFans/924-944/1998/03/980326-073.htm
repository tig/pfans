No way.  I'm ready to go again tomorrow :-)  Like I said I thought I had =
a
great time and felt fine... it wasn't until the armchair "experts" told =
me
I didn't that I started to question what took place.  I would just say
that unless they were at the same event with me, their opinions are just
that... opinions... but I do value them and many good points were
addressed.

>My own .02 is DE's ARE a great opportunity to get to know your car =

than
>public roads.

DE are the best reason to be a member of PCA... other than the drunken =
sex
parties... JUST KIDDING ;-)

>Most significantly, though, is what YOU bring to the party

Amen to that.  Every individual has different strengths and weaknesses.
Like I said in my original note, we had a young woman in an older 911 =
that
was pretty petrified after the first session... and I thought it was no
big deal.   But that's what you get when everyone is a novice track
driver... the whole range of abilities.

>Like most things, what you get out of a DE event is most directly =
determined
>by what YOU put into it.

Yep.  At the very least I would encourage would-be DE devotees to read
through a few books on high performance driving before their first event.
It will help a lot and you will be much better informed about what to
expect.  Vic Elford's book is great because it has marvelous stories and
enough details to help - BTW, anyone got a '68 Targa Florio poster =
4-sale?

See ya on the track,
