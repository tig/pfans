Now that my 82 924 seems running ok (this week anyway), I have started
to look at the interior, my it is in a bad way, the leather shift knob
cover has worn through, the stitching on the steering wheel cover is
un-stitching itself. And the drivers seat has split where the vinyl
joins the cloth. So I intend to do something about it. Has anybody tried
the alternative gear knob boots on a 924 are they any good, or should I
go for an allow / carbon one and lower boot?  Are the replacement
steering wheels any good i.e. Mono etc as I'm fed up with banging my
knees on the thing anyway so a smaller wheel might help. Lastly has
anybody replaced the std seat in a 924 with a racing type seat, these
seem to be available for less than repairing the std seat. As somebody
on this list said with a proper seat I can hopefully find out what the
steering wheel is for....has anybody tried using these racing seats, are
they any good ? how can I fit a four point harness with the std seat
belt points ? how easy is all this to fit.
