My 85.5 944 with 15" Fuchs has 215/60-15 tires.  I want a lower profile tire
so I finally decided to go with the BFGoodrich Comp T/A ZR 225/50-15.  I
called National Tire & Battery (use to be NTW) and they don't stock the tire
but when I mention Tire Rack he says he can order them and beat their price.
He called me back and said he could sell them for $115 each (Tire Rack $125
each).  I told him to get them.  He called me back later saying this tire is
on national backorder from BFG.  He said BFG recommends their R3 as a
replacement.  I've never heard of this tire.

Does anyone have other suggestions for a comparable tire?  I will probably
do 2 drivers eds and 2 auto-x this year but most of my driving is done on
the street around Atlanta (no snow but average amount of rain).

TIA
