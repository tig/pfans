     Hi Bob, i did my seal a few months ago and it was not fun!  Primary 
     problem is the fact that it was a messy job and the oil fitting that 
     is attached to the hose that goes to the external oil cooler would not 
     budge!  Even after the change i got a little brown stuff in my coolent 
     tank.  I'm not sure where it is coming from but i have no water in my 
     oil.  Below are some hints:
     
     1.  Removing the heatshield around the exhaust is easy but putting
         back the screw in the middle of the two part heatshield is not.
         I got small hands and i think i'm pretty good at this sort of
         thing but i gave up!  I'll put the one screw back when i mess with
         the exhaust header later.
     
     2.  I was able to do the job without removing the oil fitting.  I
         just moved the power steering pump out of the way and rotated the 
         assembly down.  
     
     3.  Make sure you replace the two o-rings inside the housing cover
         with the updated 'green' o-rings.  The old ones were red.
     
     4.  Make sure you use the factory recommended Loctite for the new
         seal.  I can't remember the number but i can get the number if you
         need it.  I got it from the dealer for a couple of bucks.
     
     5.  When you are ready to remove the bolts around the housing
         cover, put a large drain pan under the whole area and remove 
         the bolts slowly.  It will start dripping oil and water.  Let
         it drain slowly and then remove the bolts.  Good luck!
     
     I did this job because i had the oil leak around the seal.  It fixed 
     the problem.
     
     Ok, now on my continuing saga of the front wheel shimmy.  I replaced 
     the strut bearings with the updated sealed bearing units and the rear 
     A-arm rubber bushings and no change!  The only thing left is the a-arm 
     ball joints/bushings and steering tie rods inner and outer. What do 
     you think?
     
     By the way, the updated strut bearings vastly improved my ride and 
     decreased the steering effort.

     Subject: Oil cooler seal or Headgasket?
     
     All,
     The discussion of oil cooler seal leakage and the replacement thereof
     occasionally pops up on this list.  I've just decided to change the 
     seals.
     Occasionally I get some blackish stuff that looks kinda like oil, but 
     there's
     just so little of it I can't tell for sure.  My guess is it's either 
     the oil
     cooler seal or the headgasket.    I never see any indications of water 
     in the
     oil, so this would tend to point at the headgasket.  However, 
     considering that
     the oilcooler seal is MUCH easier than a headgasket, I think I should 
     atleas
     do that before tracking the car on the 29th.  
     
     This started as a request for the price of the seal kit, and turned 
     into a
     rant.  Sorry guys.  Any comments/suggestions greatly welcomed.
