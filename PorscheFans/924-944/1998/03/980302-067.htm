The PO of my 951 had it wired for a cell phone.  Problem is that this was
in the days before cellular antennas were regularly mounted on the glass,
so I've had to live with a nice hole in my roof (just aft of the sunroof
and ahead of the hatch) with the ubiquitous pig-tail antenna.  As it was
the '80s, the phone was fun for a while but it's been disconnected for the
past several years and the car has been relegated to weekend-only use.  I
want to get serious and remove the phone and the antenna and try and fit
one of those Fuba-style slanting antennas on the roof, similar to what was
offered on the 968 as well as on some VWs.  The 951 already has the
windscreen-mounted radio antenna, which works fine, so this would be for
cosmetic purposes only (just to cover up the hole).

Before I start removing the headliner panels, though, has anyone ever done
this to their 944/951 or played around with their 968 antenna?  It's an
unusual situation, I'll admit.

Thx
