>1) what is TrueChoice?

Truechoice is "Motorsports Equipment and Technology," located in Hilliard,
Ohio (Columbus). www.truechoice.com 1-800-388-8783. They have a catalog,
but (imho) they're not as, er, competitively priced as Racer Wholesale or
Pegasus Racing (or Summit Racing, if you can wade thru all the domestic
stuff). Is fun to look at "unobtanium" items like upside-down Koni racing
strut inserts as used by the touring car people - $995 ea, for the
brake-possessed, Brembo calipers with 8 pistons and using 4 pads...

Truechoice is of interest to this list for primarily two reasons: 1. they
will rebuild Koni's that were OEM Porsche (as will Koni), and 2. they
handle and rebuild a lot of Brembo stuff which means they *may* (I've never
seen this confirmed, so don't quote me) be able to supply bits for
"Porsche" calipers that were OEM Brembo (944 turbo and S, 944S2 and 968)

Both Koni and Truechoice charge close to the same price - testing is
$15-$20, rebuild/revalve is $85-$125, depending on model (on a 951S, the
rears get the lower price, the fronts get the higher price). Conversion is
$150 or so, I think.


BTW, this is fyi, I am offering no opinion on how good/bad Truechoice is.
