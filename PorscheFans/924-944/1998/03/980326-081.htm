I have just completed my second performance driving school which was put =
on
by our San Diego region Porsche club.  For those of you interested in
improving your driving skills, I will give you some details about the
school and my impressions.

The San Diego driving school is offered twice a year, spring and fall, an=
d
is expertly run by Vince Knauf, chief driving instructor, his instructors=

and volunteers.  The course consists of a four hour "chalk talk" classroo=
m
sesson with food, a day of driving excercises with lunch and a day of
instructed autocross with lunch.  Vince believes in feeding both empty
minds and empty stomachs.  The cost is $150 per student with the student
providing their own Porsche and the club provides everything else.

I had considered skipping the classroom session as I had attended it a ye=
ar
ago and it was the driving part of the school that I really enjoyed.  It
then occured to me that the experts who had organized the school included=

the classroom session because it was important so I attended.  The "chalk=

talk" was a four hour slide and vidio presentation created and presented =
by
one of the top drivers in our region.  What had been abstractly interesti=
ng
a year ago, now came across with crystal clarity.  My bit of track
experience combined with the quality presentation was making the light in=

my head flash on like it was on steroids . As I glanced around the room o=
f
mostly first time students, I noticed the glassy eyed look of confusion
that I had displayed a year ago.  Not only was I glad that I had attended=

the technical session but they also had an excellent selection of cheeses=

at the food table.

Seven A.M. the next morning found me sitting in line for technical
inspection and watching the water truck wet down the exercise areas.  I
received the "what are you doing here, this is for begineers" from a coup=
le
of instructors that recognized me.  It wasn't unfriendly, just that they
were surprised to see someone who had autocrossed the previous year.  Wel=
l,
in my mind, I remain a beginner/rookie until I can run with the big dogs.=
 =

To regress a bit, I had been told by an instructor that my times were
respectable.  To me respectable meant middle of the pack and he was not
looking over his shoulder when I was driving.  At that moment, I decided =
to
get as much instruction as possible so I could become competitive.  The
flyer said "performance driving school" not beginners school.  I will sig=
n
up for this school until they throw me out or until I can out drive some =
of
the instructors.

The exercises were split up into both wet and dry.  The dry consisted of
accident avoidance, corner worker, mini-autocross, slalom and
increasing/decreasing radius turns.  The wet, which were my favorites, we=
re
breaking,  pitch and catch and the skid pad.  You have not lived until yo=
u
have throttle steered without touching the wheel.  The instructor holds t=
he
wheel, I had my arms crossed on my chest and steered around a circle just=

using the throttle.  Lift to swing the rear end out and roll on the gas t=
o
catch it.  Learning to throttle steer doing pitch and catch and the skid
pad were my idea of wet fun.  I would choose them over a wet t-shirt
contest anyday.

The most eye opening revelation of the day was that 944s really understee=
r
if you do not keep the car balanced.  Since my eratic driving style can b=
e
hard on tires, I put on a old set of Goodyear GSC street tires for the
school.  It became instantly obvious during the slalom and mini auto-x th=
at
a little too much weight shifted to the rear would make the front end do =
a
hippity hop act.  When I started auto-xing, I was spending most of my tim=
e
spinning and being confused by the sea of cones.  When someone would
mention 944 understeer, I just figured the S2 must be different.

For the last half of the year we had been running R1s for autocross and t=
he
front end had stuck like glue. My S2 partner had turned fast times and my=

times were always slower.  Now I could see why my partner toasted my butt=

on a regular basis, my transitions were about as smooth as an elephant wi=
th
bee up his nose.  When I kept the weight on the front tires, the car
tracked well and I could carry speed through the corners.  But when I
shifted just a bit of weight to the rear, the front end went away and my
line was screwed.  When I made smooth transitions and kept the car
balanced, the car was out performing my ability.  My driving improved to
the point where I started pushing the car towards the tire limits.  I thi=
nk
the R1s had made it possible for me to drive faster, drive good lines and=

not have small mistakes magnified.  The change back to street tires showe=
d
me that I had a ways to go in learning smooth transitions and car ballanc=
e.
 If I win the lottery, I'm buying a water truck and a big parking lot.

The final day of the school consisted of an autocross with an instructor.=
 =

Everything I had learned in the classroom and at the exercises would now =
be
put to use.  I was pumped and ready to go.  I decided that my instructor
didn't have any grey hair so I spun on a high speed sweeper towards a lig=
ht
pole.  If I had just rolled on the gas instead of lifting.  Oh well, no
paint traded so no foul.  Towards the end of the day, my instructor had m=
e
driving smoother and I think faster than I ever had before.  I was actual=
ly
staying ahead of the car for a change and my instructor was no longer
green.  Without these dedicated instructors, learning to drive would be a=

long road of trial and error, mostly error. =


I have visions of Chief Instructor Vince assigning students to instructor=
s.
 "Noooooo, not that one, give me the one who knows where the brake pedal
is".  Nooooo, not the one with the white cane".  "Noooo, that one gave me=

whiplash yesterday and the car wasn't moving".

It was an outstanding well organized school.  Two and one half days of
quality instruction and water trucks for $150 is a tremendous value.  For=

anyone within driving distance of San Diego, I highly reccommend the
school.  If you attend in the fall, there is a good chance you will see m=
e
there painting bullseyes on the orange cones as if I needed bullseyes.
