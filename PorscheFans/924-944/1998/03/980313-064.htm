There's a saying about people who buy open-face helmets, but I don't want
to offend people on this list who may have them.

First of all, for autox, I don't think it matters what kind of helmet you
use, open or full, M95 is fine.

In DE, you aren't wearing a fire suit anyway, so the arguement goes, why
bother with a full-face helmet? Many people with full-face drop/remove the
visor in any case. (Very few people worry about eye protection.) If you
*are* planning on maybe club racing, regional events, drag racing :-),
open-wheel, etc., get a full face (and fit the helmet wearing a Nomex or
PBI balaclava).

The issue with full face has to do with chin protection, or lack thereof.
I've seen DE incidents where the steering wheel has an annoying tendency to
get in one's face during an, er, accident. Chin protection is a *good*
*thing* to have in such a case.  Both Bell (SR-PRO) and Simpson (LX Plus)
make SA95 quasi-open-face helmets with chin protection. Again, though, an
M95 is probably cheaper and just as good for DE purposes in stock cars.
Note that almost all M95 helmets are full-face.

In my region I have had running, er, discussions in the past with some
instructors who preferred open-face helmets for teaching. After one
particular incident where a car spun off and the student's (full-face Sport
II, visor removed) and the teacher's (open face Mag 4) helmets collided
well after the initial impact, I didn't hear any comments any more (not
that the instructor in question was capable of pain-free jaw motion for
months after) and a lot more instructors started sporting helmets with chin
protection.

Rally drivers (less and less) wear open-face helmets because communications
between driver and co-driver are very important, and the backup system when
the noise-cancelling intercom fails (yelling) is much easier with an open
face. They're also in a car with a full roll cage.

El cheapo wired motorcycle intercoms are under $20 and work okay.

If you know how to fit a helmet, Racer Wholesale offers good prices. Be
aware that different helmets, even from the same manufacturer, fit
differently. It seems that big-headed folk (like me) are a lot harder to
fit in SA95 helmets than previous year's certifications. I have an SR-Pro
as a result.

Helmet accessories that I strongly recommend are a helmet bag and, for the
track, a neck brace. Whiplash is an all-too-common result of relatively
minor incidents, and the brace also supports the helmet, taking some strain
off one's neck.

Just my 0.02cents.
