<<Sunday's paper had an article on synthetic oils, claiming 2-10 times the
lasting power compared to conventional oil. Changing the oil is not more
fun than driving the car. Minimizing the oil change frequency has its
benefits. Is it likely that the longer life claimed is real? I am going to
call 800-777-8491 and get the free catalog, but does the list have
experience with this claimed durability?>>

I don't doubt that synthetics have the lasting power claimed.  The problem, I
think, is that they probably get dirty just as fast as dino oils, picking up
those little pieces of grit and metal that destroy engines.  For this reason,
I change the Mobil 1 in my car every 3000 miles, even though it's expensive.
I use it because of its superior lubricating qualities and thermal breakdown
resistance, but I bet it gets just as dirty just as fast as regular oils, so
every 3000, out it comes.
