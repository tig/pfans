Hi Pfans
            My 88 944S. looks like a duck out of water with its standard
rear wheel set up, there is about 2 inches of space between the  fender
and the tires.  Surely there must be a  simple way around this problem
without interfering with the suspension setup. The original rims are
still on the car "telephone
dials"
       Spacers have been suggested to me, but it seems a very
complicated procedure and requires the suspension to be re-calibrated.
I'm perfectly happy with the car as it is, it handles and drives
beautifully.  It is only driven on the road
and I have no intentions of tracking it.  But there is that odd  looking
gap at the rear.
Any suggestions or recommendations will be gracefully excepted.
