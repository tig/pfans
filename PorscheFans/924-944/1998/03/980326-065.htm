Bill --

This sounds a lot like the supercharging of a late '85 that I did a while
back. Basic cost of that system was about $3700, but included important
items like a variable fuel pressure regulator and a chip tailored for the
application.  And don't forget the possible expenses to make sure your
engine is in tip-top shape so that it can handle the boost.  Relatively
high compression and boost can be tough to fine-tune. But it's fun to try. 

On the negative side, better brakes, knock sensor yada, yada, yada ...  get
one designed by Porsche.
