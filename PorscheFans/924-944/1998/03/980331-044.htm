944 and 944S fuel tank - $100 each

There is a whole lot of other stuff.    If you need something, email me.    The
pile represents about three cars.

There is also a complete 84 944 with only 12,000 miles.   The engine is
currently out of the car, but is complete, as is the rest of the car.   The body
has some scrapes but no dents.    This car could be parted out or reassembled.
Let me know if there is some interest either way.   I am not expecially
interested
in parting it out at the moment.

And for the 928 guys:   One complete set of 7 x 16 flat dish wheels,
cosmetically
challenged.   $400 obo for the set.

Dave
