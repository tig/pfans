>I have never done a clutch job, but are there
anything related to replacing clutch and flywheel that would cause a
leak or is the leak likely unrelated.  Also if it is not related what is
the most likely place I am leaking from.<

Randy,

Check your bill and see if the rear main seal was replaced.  If it was, i=
t
is very possible that not all the old seal material was scraped off befor=
e
the new seal was installed (right Marv?).  If they did replace the seal,
whoever did the job is on the hook.   If you rear main seal wasnt replace=
d
then it may be leaking.  Knowing what a major PITA it is to do the clutch=
,
we have to do the S2 again, I hope your oil leak is something simple.
