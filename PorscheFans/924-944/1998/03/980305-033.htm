I don't have any stake in Allstate, and I can't even vouch
for their claim handling (as I've never had to file one... knock
on wood), but my currently premium for a '93 968 is $337/6 mo.
I'm a 29-year old male, married, and only drive 8 miles to/from
work. So, obviously, you mileage will vary (pun intended).

To be honest, I was surprised by this; I was actually expecting to
pay a lot more to insure my Porsche (my driving record is good,
but not spotless).

I wonder if there are classification differences between the 944
and the 968 for insurance purposes...
