Hey ya'll,
Very cold today.  Started my 85.5 944 this morning, all normal.  Drove
about a mile, came to a few stops and noticed my engine was now rapidly
cycling between 1250 and 1850 rpm - about every two seconds.  Is this
like the famous cavitating at idle, where if you've got it, there's
almost no question you've got a bad motor mount?  I'm wondering if my
"cycling" points directly to a failing/failed idle stabilizer dohicky?

From time to time, I've read many a post about this
under-the-intake-manifold beastie but, of course, _then_ I didn't pay
enough attention.  I recall hearing that it is in fact an electric motor
of sorts.  Is that a fact?  

Anyway, on my way back from lunch today, the car idled normally from
start to finish.  No trace of the strangeness.  If I choose to stay my
hand and not jump to fix something, am I running any risks?  

TIA,  Dave Cherry
85.5 944
~338,000 miles & hoping to reach the Sea of Tranquility 
by June 1999.
