>A different approach is to change the way oil is circulated in the motor=

so
that more oil goes to the bottom end (where it is needed) and less to the=

top (where it isn't) at race rpm's. This is what Milledge (and others) do=

when they cross-drill the crankshaft, effectively doubling the supply of
oil to the bearing.<


Great post on engine oiling!  Now put on your flame proof suit  :-). =


I do not know but can you confirm that Milledge is a crossdriller?  If yo=
u
are talking crossdrilling the main journals, no arguement, some factory
forged cranks come crossdrilled stock.  It does increase the oil cushion =
on
the bearing.  I'm not sure how much extra oil it keeps in the bottom end =
of
the engine however. =


If it is the rod journals you refer to, then my opinion is a bit differen=
t.
 The oil holes on the journals are positioned to keep a cushion of oil
between the bearing and rod journal on the power stroke.  The downward
force of the rod on the journal is where you want the pressurized cushion=

of oil.  Even with the tight clearences and film of oil, the clearance
between the journal and bearing is tightest where the downward force of t=
he
rod is pushing on the journal.  Conversely (love these big words) there i=
s
a larger clearance on the unloaded or opposite side of the journal.  The
oil flows out between the journal and rod bearing.  Some oil returns
directly to the pan and some via oil rope and ball theory is flung onto t=
he
cylinder walls.  Crossdrilling does two things.  It opens another oil
outlet and it opens this outlet on the unloaded side of the journal. =

Hydraulic flow dynamics tells us that pressurized liguid will flow the mo=
st
volume on the path of least resistance.  You have a small opening and a
large opening, where is the most oil going to go?  Where do we really nee=
d
the oil cushion?  Loaded or unloaded side?  Think of when you water your
lawn.  What happens as you turn on more sprinklers (open more holes)?  Do=
es
the pressure to each opening fall?  Do we want the pressure to fall on th=
e
loaded side?  This is my semi-supported reasoning, the engineer types can=

take their shots. =




BTW, the clearances in a given engine are what predicate the use of the
recommended weight of oil.  If you use a lighter than specified weight, t=
oo
much oil will flow between the bearings and journals reducing the oil
cushion thus increasing engine wear.

Some, Tom Charlesworth (PCA 944 tech chair) for one, advocate changing th=
e
position of the rod journal oil holes 15 or 20 degrees higher than stock =
to
stop the #2 bearing problem. The factory supposedly did this on the 3.0 L=

cranks.  We laid my 87 crank and a brand new S2 crank side be side and th=
e
journal holes were identical.  Maybe on the 968 crank?  My engine builder=

chamfered the leadine edge of the journal holes to spread a film of oil u=
p
the journal rather than welding and redrilling.  Maybe someone can tell u=
s
why it is #2 that always spins.  One of the great unsolved
mysterys.....................

The oil pump cavitation is a suppossed cause of the oil/air froth problem=
=2E =

I am an owner of a pricey Miledge air/oil separator kit which is claimed =
to
be the solution.  The oil pump consists of two gears in a chamber under t=
he
crank pully.  The gear turns at a one to one ratio with the engine rpms s=
o
at 6500 rpm the pump is churning some oil.  The air in the oil could be a=

combination of an uncovered oil pickup and oil pump cavitation or one or
the other.

BTW, it is a tight fit but a 3 quart Accusump will fit in the right front=

fender well.  Also the air/oil separtor and a remote one quart oil filter=

will fit in front of the right front tire.

Maybe someone can combine all this oil info and Farzaan can post it on hi=
s
page.

Oils well the ends well
