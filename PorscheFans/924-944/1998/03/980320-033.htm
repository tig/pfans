     I just installed the 04 parts on my 951.  At first when i looked at 
     it, i thought it was the wrong part because it was so different!  
     Below are my comments:
     
     1.  The car rode much better.  So much better that i now don't
         cringe before crossing railroad tracks.  I like to keep my car
         and actually drive it on public streets.  If this is you then I
         highly recommend them.
     2.  Your dealer appears to be over charging you.  I got mine from
         my dealer in CA and the LIST price was only $111.  Their 
         parts people are like salespersons.  Or try Sonnen in Marin
         County.  Or anywhere else.  Most of the dealers that advertise
         in Excellence are willing to deal.  They also have a thriving
         mail order bussiness.
     3.  The weird looking 'weights' on the hat point toward the outside
         of the car.
     
     Factory parts are the best for street cars.  Often they are updated
     and they come with the correct hardware and they fit.  A while ago
     only the rich could afford factory parts but now it is a different
     story.  Check you dealer, start up a relationship with a parts person 
     you get along with and go back.  I'll give you some examples:
     
     Factory A-arm - $275 (86 951)
     Belt tool - $350
     Strut Bearing - $75
     
     Shop around!

     P-Fans,
     I went through the Porsche Parts locator and the old part no. 
     951.343.018.013
     as given in a Excellence mag article on suspensions, by Jim Pasha, is
     obsolete. The new part no. is 951.343.018.04 at $122.16 ea. at the 
     dealer.
     The camber plates are looking better.
