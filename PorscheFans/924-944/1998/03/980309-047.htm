Hello Porsche Fans,
  I am considering buying a Porsche 944, I'm a big Porsche fan.
However, I have never owned one myself nor have known anyone who has.
That's where you come in. I would appreciate as many responses as I
could get to help me with my decision so I don't jump into more than I
could handle. I am looking to spend around $10,000 on a newer 944,
preferably a turbo. I am also considering an '84+ Nissan 300ZX and an
'87-'92 Toyota Supra, again preferring turbos. So those are the models
for competition against buying a 944.
  I need to know if I spend $10k, how much more I would be looking to
spend a year. Are the trips to the mechanic expensive? Are the parts
expensive or hard to find? Does it need constant attention as far as
parts failing? Is the insurance much more than the other cars? Is the
maintenance expensive? I live in a small to medium-sized city
(Kennewick,WA one of the three Tri-Cities for those that know
Washington) and am wondering if I might have trouble finding a
certified Porsche mechanic to work on it.
  I need an honest, experienced response as to if it would be better
to get a cheaper more reliable sports car until I have enough $$$ to
buy a 944 or if it would be safe and low risk to get one right now. I
have heard that they are few and far between for buying, especially
the ones in good condition which are what I am looking for. How true
is that?
  I would especially appreciate a response from anyone who has owned a
944 and a 300ZX or a Supra for comparison.
  Please give me any other information that would be helpful to me. If
things work out, I would love to be a fellow Porsche owner.

Waiting for your response,

Brian Golladay
