Anyone with a 944 or 951 (or even 928) engine out of the car, and planning on
doing a fair amount of track driving, should change the rod bearings as a
matter of preventive maintenance.  Should also consider other changes (e.g.,
drilling the crank) recommended by experts like the folks at Devek or Jon
Milledge.

Somewhat contrary to a previous post, the rod bearings for the 951 can be had
from the dealer for less than $30.  You should also replace the rods nuts,
according to Milledge.

For 944 and 951 owners, the newer-style oil pan is recommended (I think
sometimes called the 8R pan-- this is a marking on its bottom).  In the 951
cars, Porsche made the change part way through the 1987 model year (see PCNA
water-cooled parts book for serial number cutoff).  Several people modify the
baffle in the newer pan for even better protection.  I had mine modified by
Jon Milledge, and believe it was/is well worth it.  Jon's engineering is VERY
thorough.

Also, for those planning on an Accusump, the cheapest prices I have seen are
from Racer Wholesale.  I bought a brand new electric valve two quart unit from
them for $200 on sale last Fall.  They also have great prices on Aeroquip
line.  I bought a bunch of -12 for my oil system and paid less than $8/foot
(recollection).

Also note that it has been the recommendation of the water-cooled technical
experts within the PCA to change out rod bearings at 60 hour intervals, and as
Ted Smith has appropriately reminded us, run the oil a little over full for
EVERY session on the track.
