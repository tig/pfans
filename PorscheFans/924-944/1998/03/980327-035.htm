Sad news folks:

        Founder of Porsche Sports Car Firm Dies at 88 

           VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Ferdinand Porsche Jr.,
           who helped his father develop the Volkswagen
           Beetle before World War II and afterward founded
           the sports car firm that bears his name, died Friday
           at age 88. 

           Porsche died surrounded by family at their vacation
           home in the resort town of Zell am See, the
           company's Salzburg office said. 

           Born in Vienna in 1909, Porsche was involved in
           cars from childhood, driving his own small auto at
           age 10. 

           ``I came into the world at the same time as the auto,
           if you will,'' he once said. 

           The family moved to Stuttgart, Germany, where his
           father, Ferdinand, became a board member and
           technical director at Daimler Motoren AG. 

           The elder Porsche founded his own automobile
           workshop in 1931 and the son, known as ``Ferry,''
           was his right-hand man, helping with the
           development of the Volkswagen, or ``people's car.''
           The first prototype left the family's garage in 1936. 

           The cornerstone for the first VW plant was laid two
           years later, supervised by a beaming Adolf Hitler.
           But during the war automobile production was
           suspended in favor of tanks and other armaments. 

           The younger Porsche's heart remained with race
           cars, however. One year after the war ended he
           began in Gmund, Austria, to put together by hand
           the first car to bear the Porsche name. 

           The Porsche 356, initially based on Volkswagen
           parts, was an immediate hit, and another plant for
           series production was built in Stuttgart, where the
           firm is based today. 

           Porsche is the epitome of sports cars and a prestige
           symbol of German engineering. Between 1948 and
           1963, almost 80,000 cars were sold from the 356
           model. 

           The 356 was replaced in 1963 by the still successful
           Porsche 911 and other models. 

           Porsche became chairman of the company's
           supervisory board in 1972 when the firm became a
           publicly traded company. 

           Although his name was synonymous with fast cars,
           the Porsches lived modestly. 

           He married Dorothea Reitz in 1935 and they
           remained together until her death in 1985. He is
           survived by their four sons. 

           A funeral service was to be held in Stuttgart, the
           company said. A date was not yet set.
