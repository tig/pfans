To All,

Regarding Mr.. Sv056. I too contacted him about his engine. Could not
arrange shipping at a reasonable price so I let the deal fall through. Two
days later he replied. Said he found a friend in the shipping business that
would do it for cheap but needed to be paid up front. The deal fell through
again (my 6th sense kicked in). You take it from there. I don't post to this
list often, but I do read it religiously every day. From the postings, I
have concluded that most of you have become cyber friends and some have even
met in person. In short, the list members have a common bond, a desire to
help each other and integrity. You would hope that anyone selling items on
this list would be trusting and prompt if paid in advance. Glad I didn't
deal with Mr.. Sv056, don't need the pain in the ass.
