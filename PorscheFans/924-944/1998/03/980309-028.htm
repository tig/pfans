While I agree that changing the oil is very important maintenance on a car,
I believe Castrol and Jiffy Lube have completely fooled the public into
thinking it is necessary to change your oil every 2,500-3000 miles.
Granted I am no expert, but I keep hearing this 'cheap insurance' excuse
for doing it.  I did the math, maybe wrong, but if you change your oil with
a synthetic every 2,500 miles as has been suggested it would cost about
$4,800 in oil changes to drive 100,000 miles.  (I used the $120 for a full
synthetic oil change on a 911 which uses 12 quarts, 944 will be less)
Following Porsche's schedule, using regular oil, the cost is about $300.
To me $4,500 per 100,000 miles is very expensive.  You can have a rebuild
done for less even if the recommended maintenance destroys the engine, but
I seriously doubt that it does.  Modern oils do not break down under normal
conditions.  Mobil 1 dramatically advertises about being a better oil at
-100 degrees and 500 degrees (or something rediculous like that), but how
often does your engine experience these temp under normal driving?  I have
always changed my oil with Castrol GTX every 5,000 miles and have never had
any problems and have saved $1,000's by not using synthetics or the Jiffy
Lube 2,500 mile suggestion.  And I, and everyone who knows me, think I am
obsessive with my vehicles.

The other concern I have is, even with recycling, that seems like a
terrible waste of a valuable resource.  Feel free to flame away or better
yet provide some PROOF that synthetics can lengthen engine life.  I don't
think that oil is the weak link in the engine, so putting even better oil
in gains nothing, but of course that is just my opinion.  (it is also my
father's opinion and he is a chemical engineer for an oil company)
