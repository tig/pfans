   I started replacing my motor mounts('87 944NA) now that the weather has
finally gotten reasonable outside.  I noticed when I removed the bolts from my
old mounts that they slid out really easy after removing the nut at the
bottom.
   However, the new mounts I have (951.375.042.04) have a threaded portion
through their upper part where the bolt goes through.  This is really
difficult to screw the bolt through the mount and then through a locking nut.
I can't imagine how difficult it will be to remove them.  
   Does anyone just strip out the thread in the motor mount so that the bolt
goes through easier, and just use the locking nut at the end?  This seems to
be the way the old motor mount was made.  Is this new motor mount made to be
used without a locking nut? I really don't feel safe not using the locking
nut?  
     If anyone has any thoughts on this could you please e-mail me promptly.
I've spent tonite removing the old bolts and nuts, and sometime this weekend I
plan on putting in the new motor mounts.

Thanks
Pete
