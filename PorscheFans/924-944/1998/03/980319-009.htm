Yes, racing *is* expensive. So, one of the two cars must go to feed habit
(and buy Nomex underwear).

1990 Porsche 944S2, rare factory limited-slip, ultra-rare factory M030
competition sport chassis option (includes Koni sport adjustable shocks
(coil-over in front), special springs and bushings, 7.5x16 front and 9x16
rear "Design 90" rims with 225/50x16 front and 245/45x16 rear tires, huge
turbo S front brakes, rolled inner fender lips, and body reinforcement).
Guards Red with black Porsche-letter cloth interior. Full load (air, alarm,
cruise, power everything, etc.) ABS. 85,000 miles. Recent control arm
replacement/rebuild, Weltmeister 28mm front anti-roll bar (factory bar
included), recent water pump/belts/etc. Almost-new tires. New Magnecore
competition wires. Schroth autocross harness. Weltmeister strut tower
brace.  All maintenance done, ready to rock'n'roll.

This very uncommon S2 is one of the best handling sport/GT cars ever built
for the road. An excellent SCCA A/Stock autocross car (former 2nd place
finish at Nationals w/Byron Short driving), it would be competitive in
Porsche club racing and could form the basis of an excellent endurance racer.

Edmunds <http://www.edmunds.com> places the US value at $16,930 with a
wholesale value of $13,485. The April, 1998 excellence magazine places the
current selling price of a base S2 between $10315 to $15700(US). I want
$15,000USD (roughly $21000CDN, depending on exchange). The car was
originally imported into the United States and thus can be easily titled in
the US or Canada. 

Or...

1992 Suzuki Swift GT, (Ser# FSR11), one of ten built for a successful
factory rally effort. Never rallied. Autocrossed a season and a half and
the car has a half-dozen lapping days. 25,000km (was stored for three
years). Needs very little to be a decent autocrosser. Needs very little to
be a (slow) regional racer. Is fun on the ice-racing course. Needs very
little indeed to be a very competitive National-level PROD1750-class rally
car. Is streetable, in a silly kind of way. Handling sorted by Walter Boyce
(previous owner).

Full details at <http://www.seko.ca/suz/suzuki.htm> This car has been the
most fun of any I've owned and I will be sorry to see it go. 

Current red book value (of a regular GT) is $6280, trade-in $5200. I want
$5400CDN (about $3800USD), including 4 extra rims with Yokohama A032R's, 4
quite new Toyo Observ G-02 M+S, 2 Nokia Hakkapelitas, (4 Firestone 670 on
car), bloody expensive factory shop manuals (over $200 if I remember
correctly), light bar w/2 Cibie and 2 Bosch lights, and assorted odds and
ends.

Call Craig days - (613) 951-6960 for more info. Both cars are in Ottawa,
Ontario, CANADA.
