     I've seen the postings about the locking nuts being opposite the valve 
     stem and it doesn't make sense to me.  Supposing that the wheel 
     balancing system used is accurate and capable of doing it's job, the 
     valve stem is balanced as a part of the tire wheel system.  The valve 
     stem is no longer a heavy spot to be counter balanced with the locking 
     nut.  But, since i believe the universe is cruel, i have tried the 
     locking nut opposite the valve stem, not using the locking lugnut at 
     all by replacing with a standard lugnut and so on.  Still the same 
     shimmy.  I also, always put the wheel back to the original orientation 
     wrt to the hub.  I also, don't have the red mark on the lug.  My 
     factory manual doesn't seem to indicate any sich marking but maybe i'm 
     just missing it.  Anyhow, i have done a lot of things to correct this 
     problem and on-car balance is next!

     That is a good call, Rich.  Furthermore, IMHO, even with the wheels
     balanced well, things can still get screwed up when you put the wheels 
     on
     the car.  So my question to the original poster is "Do you have OEM 
     wheel
     locks?" If so, where is the valve stem located in relation to the 
     wheel
     lock?  Additionally, for the front wheels is the wheel lock installed 
     on
     the stud with the red dot on the end of it?
     
     The Porsche wheels locks (at least for my old 87 944S) are twice as 
     heavy
     as the accompanying lug nuts (25g vs 12g) and will unbalance the wheel 
     if
     not properly installed.  When installing Porsche wheels, align the lug
     hole that is adjacent to the valve stem with the painted lug.  Then
     install the lock on the painted lug.
     
     You get extra points if the point on the Porsche crest is closest to 
     the
     valve stem but that is only for looks, it will not affect the wheel
     balance. 
     
     Ride on...
