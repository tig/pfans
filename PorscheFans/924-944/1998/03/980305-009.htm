Guess what - there is no answer to your question. Actually, the answer is going to be different for every car you test, for every
different gasoline, and every day with different weather.

If you want the most power available, come to a shop like mine and get a custom tuned set of chips specific to your engine, your mods
and the gas you choose to run.

And, of course, the dyno gives no input on how the chips feel in day-to-day driving. We typically spend more time on part-throttle
tuning and driveability testing than on full-throttle work.

Just my $.02, but it comes from almost 10 years of tuning and selling chips.
