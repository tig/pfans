Here is the info I sent to a few individuals on the air bag reset procedure.

The air bag reset procedure for 944/951 may be the same for the 968.  It is
documented in one of the factory manuals.  However, the procedure in at least
some of the manuals is incorrect.  There is a missing step.  The manual pages
I have are dated 1986.  Here is the procedure and the missing step:

1. Turn off ignition.

2. Apply locally made tool to test plug (see 944 FAQ for information on
"tool").  (You really don't need a switch, just a piece of wire that you can
touch to ground.  I used the door hinge for ground.)

3. Press switch button (on locally made tool).  This in effect grounds the
designated pin in the special connector (see 944 FAQ).  (I grounded the wire
to the door hinge).

4. Turn on ignition (but do not start the car).  Wait for five seconds (i.e.,
keep pin grounded).  Then release the switch for five seconds (i.e., unground
the pin).  Then press the switch for five seconds again (i.e., ground the pin
for five more seconds).

4.a. (Step missing from factory manual.  Release the switch again momentarily,
that is unground the pin.)

5. Turn off the ignition.

This is essentially the same procedure that Kevin G. describes in the 944 FAQ,
electrical section.  The 944 FAQ is at: 

http://www.connactivity.com/~kgross/944faq.html

The difference is that the FAQ says wait five seconds before step 5.  I don't
think it matters whether you unground for 1 second or 5 seconds, just UNGROUND
BEFORE YOU TURN OFF THE IGNITION.  If the procedure doesn't clear the fault
light, then you have a problem with a system component, and need dealer
service.  If you remove any airbag component, the air bag computer will tell
the DME not to allow you to start the car.  There are obvious ways around
this, as many airbag-equipped cars have had the steering wheels changed for
AX/track use.

Most of the dealers will photocopy a few manual pages for you as a courtesy if
you want to have the (incorrect) factory procedure in print.  If I had a 968,
and the above procedure did not work, I'd ask to look at the 968
manual/supplement to see if there is a different procedure.
