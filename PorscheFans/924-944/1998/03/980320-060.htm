Message text written by Philip McConnell
>The cylinder walls seem in excellent condition and I
would swear I read on this list about someone scrubing out the bores
with soapy water and scotchbrite as the only prep done before re-ringing
their pistons. What do I have to do? Or should I give up on the
re-ringing idea?<


You should replace the rings if for no reason than to replace the oil
rings.  Your oil rings are most likely gooped up and have lost tension. =

Use a piston ring expander as it is not uncommon to scratch a piston or
over stress rings when installing them by hand.  You can check the ring e=
nd
gap with a feeler guage by placing the removed ring in the cylinder.  If
you do not have a bore guage, measure the ring gap at the top of the
cylinder and at the bottom of the stroke to see if the cylinder is
tappered.

Scotchbrite is the hot ticket, it cleans but does not remove metal.
