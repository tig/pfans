I had a question about something I noticed about my new 89 951. It has the
same size tires as my 88,(225-50 front,245-45rear) but the tires fit on the
rim differently. The front looks like a large tire sqeezed onto a rim and
the sidewall hangs over the edge of the rim about 1 inch, slightly more
than the 88. The rear looks like a smaller tire stretched onto a larger
rim, with the sidewall actually pulling back away from the edge of the rim.
On the 88, it looked more like the front. My question is what  is better
and does it affect handling? Has anyone gone with a larger rear(255-45) 
Is there any effect from the size of the rim you put the same tire on? 
  Also, I noticed the 89's front end is about a half to 3 quarters of an
inch higher than the 88( I had them side by side in the garage last night).
It could be cause the 89 has stiffer springs and less miles to develp a
lag. I know I can adjust the ride height on the new car easily, and I think
the car looks better with a little more rake, but how will that effect
handling? I think thats why it seems like the seat in the new car is
higher,I thought I was imagining it.
