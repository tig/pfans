I bought my 87 951 in Apri 1997 with only 46K miles on it.  On the
pre-purchase inspection, they told me that the A/C had no freon and
would eventually need to be replaced.  They told me that they could
charge the system and see how long it lasted, and they did.  Well, it
lasted long enough that I completely forgot about it.  Especially with
El Nino around for the last months, I really didn't need the A/C.

Well, this weekend we tried it on a long drive up to L.A., and it didn't
work again.  When I pressed the A/C button, I could feel and hear the
system engage, but I guess there was no freon to compress, so only luke
warm to cool air came out.

So now I'm considering changing out the system myself, but don't know
which parts are the problem.  Also, would like to know if those "update
to federal freon standard systems" are worth-while for the extra money.

Any help on the subject would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance,
