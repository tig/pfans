Now that spring is heading my way I have started 944ing again and I have a
diagnosis to ponder. I'll put this out for comments:
My 86NA was running a little hotter as time pasted last summer / fall.
Beginning of the year it never moved from the first mark and by the end of
the year it would run up to the second mark if the revs were kept under 3k.
The rise in temp was not speed sensitive. As it turns out the quickest way
to return the temp to the first mark was to run up to 6k through a couple of
gears. (By this time you should be thinking slipping impeller) However the
944 had also developed a slight roughness at small throttle openings,
detectable by my butt only! (Ah Ha - Lean condition) I tried several things
to clear up the lean condition, removed the fuel rail and cleaned everything
up looking for air leaks around the injectors, ect. Found nothing except
very clean parts. I haven't checked the fuel pressure with a gauge yet.
After it had been sitting for a couple of months (Winter, my steep driveway
and Porsche don't mix) I drove it a couple eof days last week. Still getting
hot, maybe even a tad worse. Today I tried an interesting test, I
disconnected the O2 (replaced last year) sensor forcing a rich condition and
the temp stay at the first mark 95% of the time and the lean stumble has
gone.
So I figure the following -
Don't need to replace the waterpump (It was updated 4 years ago)
Could be the fuel pressure regulator
Possibly the fuel pressure dampener
Any thoughts??
In the very near future I will be putting it up on stands to do a bunch of
maintenance work (Belts, Tstat, fluids and trans swap) so if there are any
other ideas that need road testing let me know soon.
Thanks
Chris White
