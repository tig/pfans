Ok, here is where you get my $.02 cents.  Having been an officer with
the local sheriff's office, and my wife an officer with the local police
department for 10 years, I have to say drinking and driving is not age
dependent in the US what so ever.  I have see way too many people that
shoulud more than know better.  Most drunk drivers I have see here were
in the 30 to 55 age range.  Lets face it, at 2:00AM here when the bars
close down, almost every car you stop, the driver will have been
drinking.  And all those people will usually be well over 21.  Oh, and
trust me, they ALL say they only had 1 beer!  There must be some strong
beer out there somewhere.

Oh, and by the way, no flames for having been a cop ok :)  Cause you
know, we all bitch about the tickets, but when your in danger or need
help, what's the first thing that comes to mind? you call 911 that's
what(well in the U.S. anyway).

A helpful hint, if your driving 140 mph, they usually won't even bother
to chase you!  HAHA just kidding!!
