 Howdy there all,
I don't want to alarm anyone but planning for the Midwest 
gathering is being put on hold for a while.  I recently found
out I get to go in for some heart exams (I better study) and
thus have other priorities.  Although I do have a place to meet
here in Lafayette for sure if the Speedway in Indy doesn't
get back with me.  Don't fret, there will be a midwest
gathering even if I show up with my own set of paddles:-)
The Fiance hinted that it is all the fast driving thats taken
the life out of me.  I contest I still have 6 lives left!!
Lost two in cars, and one recently just sitting there! Anyway,
I'll make sure to keep in-touch with the list, after all
You can't separate a man from his Porsche:-)
Laters,
-Nick Miller
P.S. last count for the meet was 21 people, looks good to me!
