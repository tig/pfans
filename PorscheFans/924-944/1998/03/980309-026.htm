Well, your car has the early 944 style metal tank, but there are plastic
lines which route
gas vapors to the charcoal canister. You may have broken or dislodged one of
those lines...

> Hi, folks.  I wonder if anyone can help me figure out what I've done.
While
> putting a roll bar in my 924S, I was kneeling in the rear cargo area over
the
> gas tank.  I've removed the rear seat and I had the carpet and
soundproofing
> out from that area as well well.  Well, I was putting quite a bit of
pressure,
> apparently, with one knee in a small area.  The sheet metal flexed and I
heard
> a crunch or similar noise from below one of my knees.
>
> Since then, I've had a pronounced rattle from that area, seemingly from
over
> the gas tank.  It's a tinny kind of sound that occurs on rough pavement
and
> over bumps.  The stiff suspension (sport Koni's, etc.) doesn't help.  Can
> anyone tell me what is in that area over the tank, and what I might have
done?
> Not looking forward to pulling the gas tank to find out.  Thanks for any
> shared wisom.
