<< A reputable dealer has advised me not to flush and fill my brake fluid
 because the previous owner neglected to do it.  The dealer states that
 he has seen many small problems crop up and thinks that changing the
 fluid will do more harm than good.  I was planning on autocrossing and
 driving it as much as possible.  I would like all my fluids fresh.  The
 brakes work fine.  Any comments?  The car is a 83 944. >>

I think your reputable dealer is full of crap.
