>I totally agree with Tom.  When I first joined the list, I did so in
digest mode.  After a couple of weeks of reading stuff that I didn't really
care about, I switched to non-digest mode and set up filters to get rid of
stuff I didn't want.

>>>more space is being taken up by people wishing to talk about their
>>>racing exploits/setups.
>>
>This is all part of the Porsche experience for many people on this list
and that is what this list is about.  Our experiences, technical AND
OTHERWISE, related to the Porsche.  If this list were all technical, I
wouldn't be a subscriber.  I want the chance to hear other people's
experiences with this car.  That's what makes the car what it is, design
excluded.
>
>>>My car is my daily driver and although I occasionally use it in AX or
>>>sprints, I am more interested in tech info regarding problems with the
>>>car than knowing whether R1's are better than hoosiers or the amount of
>>>gear ratios and brake pads I can use.

>A lot of improvements, safety and mechanical wise, have been instilled in
street cars as a result of track experience.  This has been with makes of
cars other than Porsche.  I personally like reading what guys like Farzaan,
as an example, have to say about their setups, etc.  You never know when
something they say will make sense for a street-driven car.  No, I don't
drive my car on the track, it is strictly a daily driver.
