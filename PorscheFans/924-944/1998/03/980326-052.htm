True, it is a different beast.  That is why, now that my girl friend is
considering getting involved in track driving in her 951, I am trying to
figure out the easiest (safest) way to ease her into things.  My biggest
fear is that she'll be thown on the track, and be intimidated by the event.
 I could see this happening at a TT, where there is no basic training
required (Other than ground school.) She will be autocrossing this weekend
to get her feet wet (hopefully it won't be rained out, AGAIN!)

I agree, it is a much less intimidating way to get involved.  In the end I
will let Kristi decide what she want to do.  She has been to both and can
tell the differences.  I don't want her to TT until she's ready.  Plus, it
gives me more time to improve so that she'll never catch up with me (she
does have that 80lb. advantage she keeps reminding me about.)  ;-)

>But if you are going to get involved in TT, 

I'm already involved.

I've got the suit, but to be honest, I think getting a cage for TT is
overkill.  When I start club racing I will get one, but until then, I will
live with my roll bar.  Of course, when Kristi wants a bar, I may give her
mine and buy a cage, but I'll cross that bridge when we get to it....

That is why I bought my Porsche!  I knew that I couldn't let my M3 get
crunched into a little ball, so I went to find a sub-$10K car that wouldn't
devistate me if I did...Of course, I wouldn't be too pleased if that
happened....

>If it is your only way to get to work I wouldn't do it.

Nope, that is what the M3 is for...
