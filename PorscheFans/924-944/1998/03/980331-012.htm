Not a flame, Mike. Just picking up on your thought. Perhaps instead of
complaining about the number of messages/day, we should be pleased to be
part of a group that enjoys participating.  I usually don't have time to
read all the posts, but I appreciate the diversity.  I suppose we could
institute some formal prefixes for our posts to warn off members that are
not interested.  But this would probably get cumbersome.  My opinion is
that we simply have different reasons and interests for posting, and these
vary over time for each individual. Personally, sometimes I want info, very
occasionally I provide useful information, and sometimes I'm guilty of
posting just to break the tedium at work.  My own way of reducing the
number of PFan posts/day is to reply personally to someone if I think I
have relevant information that may not be of interest or useful to the
group at large.  A lot of us do this.

I think we operate, for better or for worse (Better, I think.), in the mode
of "Click and Clack" (Car Talk on NPR, on the off-chance that someone's
never heard them). Some joking around, irrelevant tangents and personal
opinions, but we have the resources to eventually provide someone w/ the
answer.  How about "J" for joking around, "I" for irrelevant tangent, etc.,
etc. ?

IMHO.
