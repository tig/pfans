I would like to add my .02 to the debate over the advice on doing your own
timing belts on a 944.  I have always been able to drive much nicer and
more exotic cars than my salary allowed because I have become quite good at
maintaing my own vehicles in my own garage at a very resonable price.   

I have a friend with a 944 who bought the timing belt tool for servicing
his own belts.  This allowed me the opportunity to play with it and settle
a bet between us.  I tensioned his belt using the previously flamed  "1/2
turn method" three times and he checked it with the guage.  I was within
15% of spec'd tolerance each time.  Granted, I have alot of racing and
wrenching experience, but I feel that any person with good mechanical
aptitude, patience, good tools, common sense and who pays attention can do
his own belts.

I do draw the line at soaking a frozen idler to free it up.  Years of racing
dirtbikes has shown me that once a bearing freezes, it's toast.  I would be
apt to pulling it apart and seeing if I can just go to a bearing house and
replacing the bearings seperatly though.

I believe that it is shear arrogance to say that you must take your car to
a Porsche shop to have it serviced.  Porsche shops as a rule charge $10 -
$40 an hour more than any other shop just because they specialize in
Porsche's.  As long as I have been wrenching on my toys I have discovered
that nuts are nuts, and bolts are bolts, and they all break.  I absolutely
love my Porsche, and feel it is one of the best sports cars on the planet,
but there is nothing that seperates it's timing belt system from any
Toyota, Honda, Ford or any other car.

In conclusion:  If you lack the ability and can afford it, by all means
take it to your favorite shop, but don't flame those of us who like giving
and recieving advice from other true Porsche fanatics who refuse to let any
other man's hands fondle our cars engines, especially at $65 an hour.
