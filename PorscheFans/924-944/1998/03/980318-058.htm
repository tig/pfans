Strange Days:

On Monday, I went over to my favorite dealer, Carlsen in Palo Alto, to get a
few parts (sprockets and idler wheels for the front of my '87 951 motor).
While there, Roger Craig came in.  I see him there at least twice a month.
Then, a guy named 'Steve" came in.  It seems that "Steve" gets a better
discount than I do, something about being Barry Bonds' "runner/gopher."  I
heard Roger tell "Steve" that Barry should behave himself at Spring training.
Well, I collected my parts, paid my money, and split.

I went to my Goodyear tire dealer to have 'em dismount some R1s from wheels
which I hope List-frequenter Jim Foley III, has received by now (yes, my dish
wheels have been sold).  There I saw a really funky looking Mercedes ragtop
with metalic blue paint, and some gianormous subwoofers in back. License
plate: McHamer.  The Goodyear proprietor told me that the car is registered to
Deon Sanders, but MC Hammer drives it (has something to do with assets and
bankruptcy).  Seems MC suffered a locked up front caliper.

I went home and changed all of the belts, and some of the sprockets/rollers on
the front of my own car.  On the way home, I stopped and bought a lottery
ticket.

Strange days.

Regarding 951 chips and the following excerpt:

>I may be convinced now, as I have never seen a 2.5 liter with just bolt on's
>exceed 300hp rear wheel without the MAF. 

>951 chips: The theory that some chip programmer is going to remap 951 chips
>and discover significant power gains or improved drivablity is just plain
>false. Too much development has already been done by the top people in the
>business for that to happen. I have tried to find the "best" chips and have
>seen little difference between the top products.  I doubt anything's left on
>the table, but please prove me wrong.

>I hope this information helps.

>Steve R

Of course, there are always trade-offs.  Driveability is an individual thing.
As many of you know, I have two 951 cars: '89 w/ Auto Thority Stage 2, and '97
with custom chips by Milledge.  There is no comparison.  Period.  If you think
that there are few if any differences, be satisfied.  If you are curious, and
want to learn more, call the finest 944/951 engine builder in the U.S.  If you
want to go really fast, and make a set of informed trade-off decisions, call
Milledge.  No offense to Bill Bechtold's connection with "famed" BMW tuner
Comforti, but Milledge has been a Porsche 944/951 guy for at least 13 years,
and is an ex-IMSA champ.  Legend has it he started out as a PCA driver's ed
driver...
