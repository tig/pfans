1.  Sometimes the car will not start.  You can hear the starter, but the
engine 
does not turn over at all.  It used to happen just intermittently, but
lately, 
its occurred every morning this past week.   Usually it will start on
the 
second or third crank (this morning it took 5 turns).  When I turn the
key, it 
sounds almost like when you turn the starter on a car that's already 
running...you get that high screech.

Hi Alex,

I had the same problem with my 93 968 at around 35000kms.  The problem
was caused by a cold solder joint on the starter solenoid.  This is the
solenoid for engaging the starter gear to the flywheel.  Get this fixed
before you ruin the flywheel as this is a big $$$ item.

2.  After a lot of snow or rain or a car wash, the first time I pull
out, I 
hear a loud creak from the front axle.  It's almost like something is
seized 
up and moving the car is freeing it up.  However, afterwards, its fine
and it 
has never happened when the car is warm or when the car has been sitting
dry.

Don't know about this one here but I would check the ball joints and the
front control arm as a precaution.
