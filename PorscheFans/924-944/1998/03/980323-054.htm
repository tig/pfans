The other day I got out of the car after driving it 45min to work and 
noticed smoke pouring out from around my right front tire!  I 
immediately suspected the new wheel bearing and called my mechanic.  He 
said don't drive it, have it towed to him.  So $50 later and $26 worth 
of labor and a test drive for 45 mins has shown NO PROBLEMS.  It was 
raining that morning and the brake rotor was cold.  Could I have 
splashed it with water.  I thought I smelled something burning.  
However, the red grease on the new wheel bearing was still red and had 
not turned black.  Does anyone have any experiences like this?  Any 
hints?
