Rob:

I couldn't obtain your e-mail directly from your PFans entry so I'm
sending this to the group and hope you read your digest...

I concur with Steve as everything I've read in various publications
indicate that 17psi is the max (safely).  I posted a formula for
calculating maximum hp from a given injector size (and vice-versa) a
couple of days ago.  Here is it again with a minor grammatical
correction, sorry:

Formula as taken from pp. 67 and 69 of the April 1998 issue of
European Car.  Thought you might find it of interest...

          Flow Rate = (HP * BSFC) / (#Injectors * Maxcycle)

Flow Rate is in pounds per hour of gasoline
HP is projected hp of the ENGINE
BSFC is Brake Specific Fuel Consumption in pounds per horsepower-hour,
generally .4 to .6 (possible higher) at full throttle.  Start with .45
for NA engines, .55 for 951s.
#Injectors, 'nuff said.
Maxcycle is the maximum duty cycle of the injector, figure .8 (80%)
for a typical OEM E.C.U.  Above this, the injectors might begin to
overheat, which can cause it to lose consistency - or even fail
completely!!

To convert pounds per hour to cc/min:
  1.  Divide by 60, giving pounds per minute.
  2.  Divide this by 6, giving gallons per minute.
  3.  Multiply this by 3.785, giving liters per minute.
  4.  Multiply by 1000, giving cc's per minute.

Now let's say you're looking to modify your car and need to know what
the maximum hp you can generate given the injector size, simply revise
the equation as follows:

  HP = (Flow Rate * #Injectors * Maxcycle) / BSFC

Rob, given that the 370cc injectors are essentially equivalent to 36
pound injectors based on the above equation, the above equation will
give us the following maximum hp potential of a 951 as follows:

80% maxcycle/.55 BSFC = 209hp
90% maxcycle/.55 BSFC = 236hp
100% maxcycle/.55 BSFC = 262hp

Obviously, there are a lot of us that KNOW we have more than 262 hp
and with David Reins pushing 460hp with stock injectors, I admit that
this equation is suspect, or maybe we're using the wrong BSFC factor. 
Again, this is for discussion purposes only.


>2-Will a slightly larger (400"ish" cc) still work and be drivable
>with the stock computer??

I would think so given that this is only the equivalent of a 38 pound
injector.  Anyone else out there have a comment?

>3-Does anyone on the "list" have a  Garrett/Miledge turbo??.

Not yet but I'm looking into the ball bearing units from Vision
Motorsports.  My roommate (525hp C2 Turbo) is probably going to
install one shortly as he's convinced it's the way to go.

I mostly agree except (and I'm sure that Randy will agree) that there
is no denying the amazing increase in driveability that the MAF gives.
 However, I did have difficulty putting up the $1,650 but I have NO
REGRETS in having done so.

Just my $.02...
