Hello,

One minor note. Changing the brake fluid will not change the clutch fluid.

Yes, I do know that the brake fluid and the clutch fluid are one and
the same. However, the fluid does not circulate. So, by changing the
brake fluid you are NOT changing the fluid in the clutch master and
slave cylinders. There is another bleed nipple on the clutch slave
cylinder.  You should probably bleed that one at least every other or
third year.

When I was having clutch problems, I hoped that it was the slave
cylinder (it wasn't, 30 hours later the clutch was fixed).  I bleed my
brake fluid very often (about 3 times a year - lots of track time you
know), and it's very clean. Boy was I surprised at the dirty, mucky,
slimey fluid that came out of the clutch slave cylinder!

Bleeding the clutch is a drag. Unless you have small hands, or can
contort your hands into very strange positions, you'll have to remove
the starter to get at the slave cylinder bleed nipple. However, doing
that every other year or so is easier than replacing the clutch master
and slave cylinder!

Good point!
