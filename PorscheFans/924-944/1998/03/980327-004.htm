I don't remember reading that, but I've seen it done in advanced groups.
Main thing is that the passee must signal to the passer *before* the pass
starts. Passee's only give the signal when they're comfortable, which
usually means at the beginning of a short straight. There seems to be an
every-wider spread of vehicle horsepower these days, and open passing
(instead of restricting passing to one or two main straights) works
reasonably well the few times I've tried it.

<sigh> All this talk about driver's ed is depressing. Thanks to a conflict,
I won't see my first PCA driver's ed until June....
