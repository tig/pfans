Well, I will post my experiences to the list for the benefit of anyone who
ends up in a similar situation. My DME does have fried circuit board on a
ground related area near the pins. I suspect that a bad ground is causing too
much current to flow to another ground via dme, or that a component in the dme
or out in the car is shorting causing power to be where it should not be. With
the unit in, the starte will not crank, the oil pressure guage pegs out at
max, the warning lights glow very faintly, and the fuel pumps run, and as it
turns out, the injectors feed fuel to the motionless cylinders. How do I know
that last bit? Because with the dme out, the above symptoms do not happen and
the engine did in fact crank until fluid locked in less than a second. I
pulled the plugs, grounded the lead from the condensor to the distributor to
avoid sparks, and turned it over, which shot fountains of gas up into the air,
most of it was conveniently absorbed my the sound insulation under the hood.
While it dries I will solder over the fried circuit board areas to see if I
can get normal operation without attempting to start, with the dme in. This
may give me some sense of the damage to the dme. Maybe it is just the lack of
grounds being available to some of the circuitry. How's that for optimism. I
sure am glad this did not happen in some god forsaken place. Any bets on which
component is behind all this? My current best guess:
-voltage regulator
-a sending unit
-oxy sensor ( short on one of the heating wires to the sensor wire)?
