-- Only odd thing about the car is a script "Turbo" decal applied to the
right
-- front fender, on the flat portion up next to the hood. I have seen
the
-- decal and instructions for replacing same in the shop manual, but I
have
-- never seen one on a car. The car is red and the decal has a
silk-screened
-- effect so that it starts black and then fades away as it flows back
along
-- the fender top.

I just purchased an '89 951 for a friend last week- it was Garnite (red)
with the turbo decal.  The decal looks better than I would have
expected, but has started to crack a little, and I don't know how to
maintain it or remove.  As to the chips, this car also has stage 2
Autothority chips, which makes my non-chipped 89 951 feel slow.  This
car will break the rear tires loose in second gear when it hits 4,500
rpm (in cold weather with cold tires)- pretty cool, as long as I don't
get to sideways!
