Mine are chestnut which is almost red. I've only had them a few weeks tho=
ugh. I ordered from Performance Products. They don't seem to be particula=
rly hard to keep clean. Like with any carpet regular vacuuming is the bes=
t thing for them.
The thing to realize is that the carpet fibers need to be agitated. Vacuu=
m attachments and service station vacuums don't suck out all of the dirt =
nor do they agitate the fibers to help maintain their "fluff" for lack =
of a better word.
What I do is to remove them from the car and run over them with the regul=
ar vacuum just like I was vacuuming the carpet in my house.
