     Well, i guess every shop has unhappy customers.  I had Ken's do my 
     clutch job about 7 years ago and this is my experience.
     
     1.  He was courtious and willing to help.
     2.  He failed to call me when the bell housing was off to discuss 
         the condition of the pressure plate.  He just went ahead and
         reinstalled the old one.
     3.  The car chattered on take off immediately.
     4.  He test drove the car and tried to convince me that it was
         'normal'.
     5.  When i came back again, he told me that he 'wasn't going to
         give me a free clutch job...".  i was so disgusted that i just 
         left.  I actually only wanted the one good clutch job i paid for!
     
     After years of chattering, i finally did the job myself with all the 
     factory parts.  Here is what i found.
     
     1.  Wrong clutch disk.  I did not get the turbo disk.  I got the 
         single spring disk.  I was never consulted and i would never
         have agreed to install a non-stock part.
     2.  Loose and missing nuts and washers on my exhaust system.
     
     After i did the job with new correct parts, now the clutch is smooth 
     and light.  Before it was stiff and inconsistent.
     
     My opinion is that Ken's is a lousy place to take your car for repair. 
      I put up with years of clutch chatter and poor performance.  His 
     after service performance was worse.  Just my experience....

     P.S. I still have the incorrect disk as a reminder that only YOU truly 
     care about your car.

     are very reasonable.
