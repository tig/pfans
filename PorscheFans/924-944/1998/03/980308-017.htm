As much as I hate to admit it, I am in the insurance industry.  I can
tell you that stating that your insurance costs $XXX.XX every six months
means nothing if you don't list your limits.

For Example, We will compare company A and Company B (They are fictitious
and for clarifying):
Liability Only:

Company A:		Company B:
$300 / 6 Months		$220 / 6 Months

Limits:			Limits:		
100,000 PD		50,000 PD	PD = Physical Damage
300,000 BI		150,000 BI	BI = Bodily Injury
100,000 Each Occ.		50,000 Each Occ.	Each Occ. = Each
Occurance

At  first glance (price only) it would appear that Company B is the
better buy, but upon further review, with the limits listed, you can see
that Company A is the far better buy.  Twice as much coverage but NOT
twice the premium.   These kins of examples do exist in the real world,
that is why it is not good enough to compare price alone.

I would suggest to all P-Fans, that to compare rates correctly, you will
have to list the limits of your policy.

If I were to say that I pay $200 / 6 Months with American Family, I think
you all would want to know my agents name.  But if I told you I have a
multi-car discount of 20% and have limits of 50/100/500 with Comp and
Collision ("Full Coverage") and deductibles of $250.00 on each comp and
colision, you now have a better reference point and you may have a better
rate.  BTW, American Family is only in 22 of the 50 states of the Union,
so it is not available everywhere.

If there is anything I can do to answer any questions, please feel free
to ask.
