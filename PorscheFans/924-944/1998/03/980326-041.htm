     I have found that a great cure for that dull look on older cars is a
product called Imperial Hand Glaze from 3M. On older cars the paint has
less resistance to scratches that cause the haze that makes it look dull.
It takes a while to do by hand(by hand will look better) but is well worth
it and usually 3 times a year is enough. 
So, 
1. wash the car(once a week at least)
2. dry the car(I stopped using chamois and found the haze takes longer to
come back. Use soft terrycloth towels, freshly washed.) 
3.rewax every couple of months depending on paint condition, (look at how
well water beads up on car.)I use Zymol.
4. Every three or four months, Polish with Imperial Hand Glaze, then wax. 
5. If your paint is really oxidized, use the next step up 3M product that I
cant remember the name of, its white and comes in the same type bottle as
the Hand Glaze. Then the glaze, then wax. 

I absolutely wont use a Chamois anymore. I found that it puts tiny
scratches in the paint and causes the haze. Also, dont let road grime sit
on the car for long. It will eat the paint. My neighbors laugh at me when I
wash my car in the rain, but I refuse to let the grime sit and wet is
different than dirty. The same neighbors will tell me how great my car
looks later on.
