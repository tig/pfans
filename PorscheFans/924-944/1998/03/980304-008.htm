Sunday's paper had an article on synthetic oils, claiming 2-10 times the
lasting power compared to conventional oil. Changing the oil is not more
fun than driving the car. Minimizing the oil change frequency has its
benefits. Is it likely that the longer life claimed is real? I am going to
call 800-777-8491 and get the free catalog, but does the list have
experience with this claimed durability?

I found a shop that seemed to know what aligning a Porsche is all about, by
phone. The guy I talked to said that caster and toe are  the main things
with tire wear, and is included in a lower cost version of alignment.
Handling is also affected by camber (did not say how much or what kind &
under what circumstances, which I hope someone on this list will comment
on), and adds to the cost of the alignment. He also says that it is not
always possible to correctly align a car to spec without changing some
parts (if the adjustments required are considerable).

My alignment readings vs specs were (recently) as follows (*** = way out):

	Left Front			Right Front
Actual	    Spec				Actual		
-0.9*	-0.6 to -0.1	camber		-0.7
1.3**	2.3 to 3.0	caster		0.6***
0.18**	.04 to .12	toe		-0.18***

	     Front
Cross camber: actual -0.2,  spec -0.2 to 0.2
Cross caster:  actual 0.8**,   spec -0.5 to 0.5
total toe	:        actual -0.01***, spec .08 to .25

	Left Rear			Right Rear
Actual	   Spec				Actual
-0.8	-1.3 to -0.7	camber		-0.8
-0.21***	-.08 to 0.08	toe		0.18***

	Rear
Total Toe: actual -0.02, spec -0.17 to 0.17
Thrust Angle: actual -0.19*, spec -0.17 to 0.17

The handling of this car for street use has been acceptable. No "drift"
cornering has been attempted. Car tracks as straight (when driving on a
straight road)  as an arrow as far as the driver can tell, although from
the readings it must be "crabbing" a bit. There is no pull on the wheel at
all. You can take your hands off the wheel without any tendency to drift.

Until such time as I might consider racing or driving this car hard, should
I just adjust for the tire wear (which is excessive on the inner part of
the treads), which is going to mean adjust the toe on all four wheels, and
the caster on the front?

In fact, are the camber settings so close that they should be left alone
regardless?

There was a beautiful post on balancing the weight on the corners not long
ago. Where do you look for scales to measure the weight on each wheel? At
the alignment shop? Or a truck axle weight scale such as might be found on
the mainland at a scrap yard?
