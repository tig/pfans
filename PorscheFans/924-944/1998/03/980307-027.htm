Hi, all,

I just crawled out from under my car after trying to find the oil leak
that my mechanic said he fixed while doing a recent belt and water pump
replacement.  It's a good thing that I went looking, because I found an
oil line hold-down clamp and a PS fluid hold-down clamp that were not
refastened.  The oil line was no problem, but the PS hose was lying
against the PS pump belt and now has a nice groove worn in it!  The PS
hose (the one running from the reservoir to the pump) has a hold-down
clamp around it, but I can't find where it's supposed to be attached and
I'm really not sure if the hose was returned to its original routing
after the water pump replacement.

If someone wouldn't mind checking their own car and letting me know the
hose routing and clamp attachment point, I'd be eternally grateful! 
Thanks.
