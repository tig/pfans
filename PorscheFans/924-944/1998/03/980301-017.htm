I once owned a Seat Ibiza 1.5 with ~85hp.
The writing on the motor was "Design by PORSCHE". From what i've
heard, Porsche wasn't to happy about this, cause the SEAT engineers
changed the motor design and so messed up the engine's characteristic.
This car had no low end torque and a very rough running engine.
Not worth the bandwidth...
