Ok, here is the deal on the 88 Turbo S for sale here.

88 turbo S, burgundy in color, kind of linen interior with black dash,
66,949 miles, factory reno with cass, tinted windows, factory chromed
wheels, A008R's, cruise.  VIN WP0AA2959JN151581.  They are asking
$17,500.

It is at a consignment lot, so the owner set the price, not the lot. 
I'm sure he will take less, basically cause he will have to if he wants
to sell it.  The car needs rear tires.  With the linen color, the cloth
inserts on the seats are dirty on the drivers side.  the passanger seat
has a stain also.  it is the factory Porsche cloth and there are no
rips.  The body looks good, I didn't see any sign of damage or repair. 
Is the car perfect? nope. but it is a 88 turbo S and it looks like a
good original car.  As always I would say get a pre purchase inspection
done and I can tell you where here in Tulsa (Rennsport 918-663-2906). 
My only interest here is I know how few and far between these cars are,
especially when you are looking for one!  I have no stake in this
matter.  If your interested in the car, here is the lot contact info.
