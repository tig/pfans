Howdy,

Just a note that we are now leaving for Bremerton.  If anyone wants to stop
by, we will be at our motel tommorow evening (Holiday Inn Port Orchard).

We are going to attend the PCA event on Saturday.  If it's a training day,
Mark will likely run and Paul and I will be just spectators.  If it's a 
normal event, we'll be running too.

For Sunday, Paul and I will be arriving at the site somewhere around 8:00am.
Participants are expected to be there around 8:30am.  The trophy place
screwed up my order and has instead delivered MUCH more expensive trophies
for a price not much higher than negotiated.  The people in the 1-3 rank
of Novice and Senior and the top 1 of Pro will walk away with a $50 trophy!
All others will be getting a $30 trophy.  You can't complain about that! :)

Anyhow, see you at the event, and hope that all can make it, rain or shine.

Farzaan.
