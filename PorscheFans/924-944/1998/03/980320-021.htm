Do you know if you need to replace the rings?  If you really wanted to, you
could remove the rings from the pistons and check the end gaps of them to see
if they are in spec.  If they are in spec put them back on.  If you remove the
pistons though, you'll have to wait for your rings to set again.

Not worth it in my opinion, unless you know the leak down test is bad.

I needed to remove some corrosion so I used scotchbrite and soapy water.
 However if your cylinders are clean, I wouldn't touch the walls with the
scotchbrite.  I endedup sending the block to Motor Works to have the cylinder
walls prepped.
