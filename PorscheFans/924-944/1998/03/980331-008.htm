Greetings,

After spending the past couple of weeks fixing problems with my newly rebuilt engine 
(1989 951, 610 easy miles), I came across a severe oil leak at the front of the engine. 
I took the upper plastic cover (the one that covers the timing and B/S belts), and no 
oil on the inside, no oil near the sprockets and belts. The oil is coming from behind 
the  plastic cover, between cover and  engine. 

To my understanding, if the front seals were leaking, I'll have oil inside the plastic 
cover around the belts' sprockets. Where could the oil be coming from? Any hint on 
finding the leak, without removing the belts and pulleys... At the moment I'm waiting on 
a new distributor cap, as the one on the car was broken due to incorrect installation 
procedure (DO NOT ASK HOW!!!). I have a dyno day scheduled on Friday, and I would like 
to determine if it's OK to drive the car as is for a while (1000 miles) before I put it 
back in the shop.  

Any suggestions, hints will be appreciated. This has been a long, frustrating and 
expensive nightmare, Help!

John Joseph
