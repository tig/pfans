The right rear corner is ROARING like crazy again. I had the inner and
outer wheel bearings changed just 34K miles ago and here we go again.

In the interim, I got a refurbished set of cookie cutter OE wheels and new
tires. Could this have put strain on the bearings in the axle? I'm really
getting tired of this kind of maintenance...

And to J.T. Sellers, I appreciate the response, but respectfully disagree.

When I bought my 83 944, it also had about 88K miles. It now has nearly 150K.
If you drive the car as much as I have, you will soon see why I disagree. I
have put an UNGODLY amount of cash into this car in a four year period.
I also paid for it in cash, only it took me two years because I was making
$4.25/hr and in college at the time.

I now have an MBA and a better salary, but can still feel the drain on
haphazard maintenance items such as these darned wheel bearings, which will
cost another $150.

Drive your 83 another 60 thousand miles, and let me know how much you've spent
by then!

Respectfully yours,
