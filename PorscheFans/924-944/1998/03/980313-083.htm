<< My questions are this, for dependabilty, 
 performance, and a big sound, is a Borla the only way to go?  If 
 so where should I get it?  Finally who or where should I have it 
 put in? >>

For reliability I guess you'ld want stainless steel.  You can either weld a
new muffler onto the cat-back pipe or  buy a whole cat-back system.  The
muffler would probably be about $150-$200, the whole cat-back about $500 from
adds and catalogues I've seen.  I'm not sure about the muffler type you want
as I'm more familiar with the turbo.  I bought a Supertrapp once (with the
removable disks to tune backpressure) but it doesn't work well on turbos, or
atleast not well on my 951, as it needs a straight through type muffler.  I
think I'm going to try a Dynomax race muffler for $35.
You should just install it yourself.  If you get the cat-back, it should take
you about 1/2 hr plus time to remove 4 exhaust bolts to swap.  If you get the
muffler, you may want to have someone weld it unless you can weld with
stainless steel.
