I returned from Raleigh today and my 944S seemed to be a little too hot.
The guage registered about 1/4 for the whole winter, but today which was
in the 70-80's it registered 1/2 that is, until I turned on the AC. The
temp gauge then proceeded to about 3/4. I was traveling 80MPH (don't
tell anyone OK!?), it seemed to hold alright, but I am concerned that
when the temps get into the 90's I might have an overheated car. Anybody
care to comment on what they see - as far as operating temps go? 
Before I got the cat the water pump was replaced and supposedly updated.
Before I get into replacing thermostats, etc, I thought I'd ask the
authoritative sources!

Yours in "Porschedom"
