It is very easy to understand, my car is just damn fast :)  Just kidding.
Your numbers are actually very, very good.  I was plotting them out 
against my runs and noticed that your torque comes in later and harder
as does your HP.  But, the one thing that concerned me (actually was
pointed out to me by a very alert list member) is that your test was
done in 3rd gear!  Your dyno operator did not follow Dynojet's instructions
correctly and should do another run for you for free or at least with a
discount.

According to Dynojet, on turbo cars, you are supposed to do the test in
3rd gear, then 4th gear and the gearing is ok, even 5th gear to determine
which gear loads the engine enough to actually made decent low rpm boost.
In my car, 4th was ideal (5th was too fast for the machine) and produced
about 10hp more than 3rd gear did.  On the video I took of the boost gauge,
the boost did not build up high enough in 3rd because of too low of a an
engine load.

Making the assumption that you would get 10hp and 10ft-lb of torque running
in 4th (I'm being conservative), you would then have 285hp and 285ft-lb of
torque at the wheels.  Using a 15% conversion to flywheel HP, you have:
285 * 1.15 = 328hp @ 5500rpm
285 * 1.15 = 328ft-lb @ 4800rpm

In comparison, using the same conversion, my car has:
260 * 1.15 = 300hp @ 5500rpm
272 * 1.15 = 312ft-lb @ 4300rpm

Now, the thing to look at is "power under the curve".  Sure, my car has
what look like good numbers, but look at how my torque falls off as
the compressors efficiency goes down, whereas your K27 is still pumping
some good air into the motor.  If both of us exit a corner at 3500rpm,
my car will take the initial lead, but yours will leave me for dead
when we get into the 4500rpm+ range.

I would go back to the dyno place and tell him to re-do the run in 4th
gear, take a diskette with you and ask the operator to put the files on
there, then email them to me and I'll analyze them and compare them to
my numbers as well as Powerhaus's numbers.

I don't think you have anything to worry about, if I had your power,
I'd start saving for rear tires :)

Buschur Racing sells A/F mixture gauges.  I personally use one that is
made by K&N, works well enough, there are better and cheaper units.
You can't really rely on those 100%, you need a fast reacting EGT gauge
to really tune a car properly.  Motec has a $3000 A/F mixture unit that
is supposed to be very, very accurate and very fast reacting.  Buschur
uses that unit to tune his 600hp 2.0L 4-cylinder motors.

The A/F mixture gauge can tell you whether you are really lean or really
rich, but they work best near stochio (sp?).  My car, if memory serves
right was somewhere around 12.5:1 - 13:1 (anyone remember the numbers I
posted ages ago?).
