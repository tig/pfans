Tom:

I have both a Bell Mag 5 and a Bell M3.  I use the Mag 5 for the closed 
cockpit stuff and the M3 for the shifter kart.  My advice is to purchase 
the lightest helmet you can afford.  It is surprising how big a difference 
a few ounces can make on the way your neck feels after 20-30 minutes of 
lapping let alone after a day or two of multiple lapping sessions.  Also, 
get a neck brace.  They take a little getting used to but the support they 
provide is a welcome neck relief and the additional margin of safety 
provided to your spinal column is well worth it.

As to the open vs. full helmet issue, one of the questions is are you using 
a 5 point harness?  Do the shoulder straps go though the seat?  If you 
answer yes to both of these questions I think the probability is such, and 
there will those who will take issue with this, in the event of an incident 
of your chin coming in contact with the steering wheel is nil.  And the 
open helmet is far more comfortable and easier to communicate when on than 
the full helmet.

A helmet brand I have been most impressed with, but there priced at the 
upper end of the market is the Stand 21 product.  Very light weight, more 
fire retardation, more custom fitting options than any other helmet on the 
market and last but not least the only, according to Stand 21, injection 
molded kevlar helmet on the market.
