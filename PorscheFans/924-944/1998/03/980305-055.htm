I had this problem about a year ago and it seems to have reappeared.  My
rear passenger wheel seems to creak under force.  By this I mean it
seems to come from the wheel and occurs when I accelerate or engine
brake, but not when I use the brakes or am coasting.  The creaking is
discrete and proportional to engine speed.  The first time it happened
my alignment guy thought it might be my 3 piece wheels (Gotti) creaking
at the bolt interface from hub to rim.  We tightened them and it seemed
to stop.  Yesterday I tried the same proceedure and it didn't help.  Is
there a problem with my wheel?  I torque the 3-piece bolts to 14 ft/lbs
and the lug nuts to 97 ft/lbs, so I think I'm following specs.  Any
suggestions with what might be wrong?  Does a CV joint or disc brake
ever make this noise?  I've never heard of something like that, but I'm
at a loss now.
help,
