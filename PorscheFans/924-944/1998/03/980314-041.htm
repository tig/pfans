<< Thanks.  Why does the cat-back system cost 2 times more?  Doesn't the cat
 back just come with the input pipe whereas the muffler does not.  What is the
 importance of tuning the back pressure?  TIA. >>

The pipe from the muffler to the end of the cat has a couple of bends in it
and the flange, plus the additional tubing (about 3 or 4 feet).
The backpressure tuning thing is a pretty deep topic.  Basically, the pressure
outside of the exhaust valves determines how much of the burn gasses get
pulled back into the chamber and mixed with the next charge.  This is called
Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR), and effects how the charge burns.  I think
the more exhaust gas you add to the charge, the faster the charge burns, but
can't remember for sure  (the phenomenon is MUCH more complex than this
statement however).  I put a straight pipe on for the muffler (so no cat or
muffler) once, and it really killed the lowend BAD.
