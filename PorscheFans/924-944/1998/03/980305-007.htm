Greetings,
I have my 1986 951 insured as a third car (7500 miles a year) through =
Allstate insurance company. This is full coverage with 0 deductible on =
the glass and $500 on everything else. The premium is $660 per year. The =
biggest problem some of you are having is your age. Driving record means =
nothing when your young. I will not post my age thank you, but enjoy =
your youth. Life goes buy you as fast as the cars you drive.
John
1986 951
