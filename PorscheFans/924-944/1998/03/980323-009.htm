I recently purchased my first  Porsche. An  89 944 with 65,000 miles on it.
The car vibrated quite a bit at idle and I had the motor mounts replaced. This
smoothed things out a little but there is still a fair amount of vibration
present. I also had the timing belt tension and the balance shaft timing
checked and they were within spec. The timing belt was replaced at 60,000
miles. I was told by the shop that some 944s vibrate more than others.

My questions are: 

Should the car vibrate at idle and if so how much?

Is it possible to get bad motor mounts and how do I tell if they are hydraulic
or solid rubber?

Also, could someone describe the symptoms of the 944 rubber clutch problem?
