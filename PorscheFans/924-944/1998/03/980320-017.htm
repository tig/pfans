I was wondering what the collective experience has been in replacing
piston rings. I am replacing all the bearings in the lower end of an '87
944 engine. I thought that while I was in there, I might do the piston
(yes, the head is off too) rings as well. I live in a very small town in
northern California and no one near here is familiar with the cylinder
wall prep as described in the manual. I'm also aware that it's a really
bad idea to use traditional methods such as those used on iron engines
on a 944 block. The cylinder walls seem in excellent condition and I
would swear I read on this list about someone scrubing out the bores
with soapy water and scotchbrite as the only prep done before re-ringing
their pistons. What do I have to do? Or should I give up on the
re-ringing idea?

Thank you very much in advance for any ideas or suggestions.
