Hi Alex,

Yes, those darn caps can be a REAL challenge!  I took an old screwdriver 
and bent it 90 degrees to slip into the space allowed and then just 
fought it until it gave up.  The bottom screw is particually hard to deal 
with.  The design is very simple: the screw is just a straight shaft with 
a 90 degree bent end that goes up and over a cast tab on the distributor 
mount housing, fitting into a notch in the top of the tab.  It can turn 
either way if I remember correctly but I had my best luck in just shoving 
it in a deeply as I could and then rotating counter-clockwise.  
Reinstalling it later is also a pain!

By the way, exactly what differences did you notice with the new mounts?
I am a fairly recent new owner of an old 944 (85.5 na) and don't have the 
experience to know what good mounts feel like.  What should I be looking 
for?

Thanks,
