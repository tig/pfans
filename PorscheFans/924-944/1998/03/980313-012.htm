Randy:

Sorry to keep bothering you but a few comments/questions as respects
your responses to Mark/PFans:


>This has changed to the MFS chips.  I tried the K-27 chips with >the
MFS and the car started but would go dead if you tried to >give it
gas.  I ran the K-26 Stage II chips with the K-27 at >first(before
MFS) and when I switched to the K-27 chips it >seemed like the car ran
better with the K-26 chips. Point is >there was a big difference in
mapping of MFS chips.
===============================================
Same thing happened to me when we installed the K-27 chips
(accidentally sent with the MAF) on my K26S.  Lots of smoke under load
and almost no power to the point of stalling.
================================================

================================================
1.5 bar!!!!  That is some serious boost (21+ psi)!!  Have you upgraded
the injectors to handle the increased fuel requirements?  I've heard
that the stock injectors are running at over 90% at 17psi.  In
addition, in the latest issue of European Car, they have an
interesting article on calculating injector size
based on current/projected horsepower and vice-versa.  I don't have
the formula handy but will post in on Monday for the list's use.
 
When I try to run more than 1.1 (16 psi) of boost, the car starts to
ping, even though I've used Sunoco Ultra 94 since buying the car.  Any
suggestions on why this would happen?  I'm thinking it could be
because the head has been milled twice but I still don't think my
compression is as high as yours.

Also, have you installed the Wide Ring Fire Gasket to help avoid blown
head gaskets?

Finally, I've read about the usage of the "993 Compressor Bypass
Valve" for 951s.  What does this do?  Part #?  Price?
=================================================

>Also, there was an earlier discussion about where the power >gain
from the MFS was most pronounced: low end or high >end.  David Reins
told me low end, Autothority told me high >end(You would think they
would know, they made it).  David >Reins is right as far as I can
tell.  Pronounced difference on
>low end, can't tell if there is a difference up high, but the Dyno
>wil give the real answer.

===================================================
I agree with you and David.  MUCH better driveability on the low end,
very little difference on the high end.

Just my $.02 and too many questions (sorry) ...
