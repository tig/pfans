Hey Dude,
  The rear speakers are a real pill to get to. You have to remove the panel 
they are hiding behind. Yes, from the floor to the roof. Take your time, and 
count the hardware you remove. Once you have the panel off, your can remove 
the speaker. It is a 4 X 6" speaker. You can get a replacement from any 
audio shop, but I would recommend getting what is called a 4 X 6" PLATE 
speaker. These fit in the same holes, but have two smaller speakers insted 
of one oval shaped speaker (sounds better). SONY makes a real nice 4 X 6" 
plate speaker. It has an oversized 4" mid-range driver with a small, soft 
dome tweeter next to it. I used to have some in a VW Golf, and LOVED them. 
Now I have my 944, and love it even more! 
 The same goes true for the door speakers. The Sony plates are very nice. If 
you want to get really creative, there are many options you can explore 
about mounting bigger, and better speakers in the doors and on the dash. 
These additions can really make sweet listening spots for you and your 
passengers. A local audio shop can talk about options like that with you. 
Ask to see some of their work in a customer's car....NOT their own. Really 
nice work should NOT look like an addition, but OEM. Also, ask a lot of 
questions about preserving the car's interior so everthing can be removed 
without leaving HUGE holes in stuff (in case aliens force you to sell your 
car). I do not recommend trying anything fancy unless you are really 
knowledgeable about custom audio installs. It is a hobby of mine that has 
taken me to shows and sound-offs here and there. I mainly do it for my own 
personal satisfaction (that, and I love nice audio and can't stop tinkering 
with things). 
  If you have any further questions, let me know. 
       Todd
