Hello Mark
=09
=09What was the ambient air temp? On my car when it is 70-80=92F outside,=
 I can=0Aonly pull 16 psi, but when it is 35=92F I can pull 19 psi in 4th=
 gear! Also what=0Agear were you in? Should be 4th or 5th for max boost. =
19 psi attained in 4th=0Agear is only 10 psi in 1st gear!  I have a 1.85 =
jet/banjo-bolt on my otherwise=0Astock 951 with just a test-pipe & APE V2=
..7 chips. Some cars will not produce=0Athe same boost with the same size =
jet! That is why AutoThority came out with=0Ausing the JET method. 
=09Look for a pressure leak along the intake track. Check all of the inte=
rcooler=0Arubber joints, and the rubber turbo pipes for a loose clamp. Th=
ey are hard to=0Areach!!!  Make sure the intake manifold nuts are tight a=
t the cylinder-head. 

Good Luck
