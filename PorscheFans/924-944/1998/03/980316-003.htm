Folks,

Left an auto-x early today due to a high-pitched squeal
(not a squeal of delight) under the hood.  Since I haven't
seen this one on the list, I'll let ya'll know what I've
found. My car is 90 S2, others may vary.

Symptom was a high-pitched squeal, apparently in the
vicinity of the distributor.  Pitch independent of
engine RPM.  Lasts for a moment after the engine is turned
off.  Later fiddling found the squeal present with the
heater temp at cold, and disappeared with it set at warm.

Directly behind the distributor lives the valve that
controls coolant flow into the heater core, and then to
the cabin.  The valve is controled by an actuator,
connected to the valve by a plastic linkage. The actuator
is a black plastic cylinder about 2 1/2" across that sits
above the valve, next to the power steering fluid
reservoir, and just behind the distributor.  It's got a
small nipple on the top which connects to a vacuum line. On
the bottom of the cylinder is the actuator arm that
connects to the valve.

The actuator is nothing more than a diaphram (maybe a
spring return?) that runs the actuator arm.  The diaphram
had cracked with heat/age and the squeal was a vacuum leak
through it.  My heater temperature control still worked though!
Looks like a cheap part - probably available through a VW
dealer.

Add it to your list of things that break ...
