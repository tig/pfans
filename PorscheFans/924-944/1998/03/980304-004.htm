Hi all,
	I just bought some "blue light" halogen bulbs for grins.  I can't speak to
how they work as my car has been in the shop for the past 4 weeks.  Anyway,
I bought some H4s from Automotion last month, and with all the talk about
the blue lights, decided to use Webcrawler to search using something like
"blue AND halogen".  Anyway, I found Imparts on the web who had H-4 55/60
blue lights for 8.50/each.  For $20.95 (including shipping), I figured what
the heck.  What else can you by for $20 for this car.  

What I received was 2 bulbs manufactured by Nam Yung Lighting Co, Ltd in
Korea.  Model name is EAGLEYE - H4 "All Weather Bulb".  Part number was
P43T.  Basically, it looks like some metal or chemical was deposited in the
bulb creating a blue film on all parts.  I don't expect it to do much
except maybe look a bit distinctive.  

If you want, try www.imparts.com.

YMMV.  For all I know, the blue coat will hold heat and burn the bulbs out
in a month.  Then, back to the bulbs that came with the Hellas.

P.S.  As many have noted, these have NOTHING in common with the new units
being put out by M-B, Porsche?, etc.  What are they called? H.I.D.?  High
Intensity Discharge (just a guess, I love to put meanings to acronyms :-)
These units have more in common with flourescents, I believe.  Inert gas,
step-up transformer and some inversely charged plates which actually use
the gas molecules to generate light as opposed to standard element type
bulbs which pass a current through an electrode which heats up and gives
off light.  Downside to the element is that you're boiling off the element
bit by bit and wasting an incredible amount of power as heat.

P.P.S.  Anybody know what frequency they run at?
