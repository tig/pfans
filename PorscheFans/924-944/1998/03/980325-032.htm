Hi all !!

   Well, at least I know how to get response to my postings. Say
something the least bit disparaging about a Porsche. I am not trying
to say that other cars are better because the timing belts "seem"
to last longer, I just think that for such a superior car, the timing
belt is crap !! I also must live in the wrong state because if I drove
my 944 around above 4000 rpm all the time I would be unable to get out
of 2nd gear without accumulating a pile of tickets. I actually drive
my commute car ( It is a T------a ) much harder than I drive the 944
on a regular basis and being a designated yuppie I have lots of friends
with Lexus, Accura, etc... and none of them have to replace timing belts
at 30k to avoid almost certain disaster. Do the other Porsche water
pumpers also suffer from the same problem ? 
 If I could only have one car though it would be my 944 even with its
quirky timing belt !!!!!
Go ahead, flame me !! I'm wearing my Nomex !!
