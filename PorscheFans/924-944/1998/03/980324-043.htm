All,
I just installed another welded 2/3 exhaust manifold.  I think the last one
cracked at the weld because it was a force-fit to install and we didn't use
stainless wire. I insulated both with header wrap (fiberglass tape, about 2.5
inch X 1 or 2 mm).  Like the international measurements there?   Anyway, it
was a nice even job over both headers that was a total of about 3mm thick and
covered the entire manifold up to the flanges.  

The 2/3 manifold I just installed is wrapped with a thin layer of asbestos
cloth (soaked in high temp paint to encapsulate the asbestos, it blew a
fireball out of my oven, but that's another story)  The insulation on this
manifold is about .5 - 1 mm of asbestos and ends about 1 - 2 inches from the
exhaust flange.  It is noticably hotter over the manifold area now.

I think what this means is that I have one exhaust manifold insulated alot
more than the other manifold.  Even if the thin layer of asbestos is as good
as or better (as I'm pretty certian it is, I'ld have to look it up) the
exposed 1 - 2 inches of pipes is a MASSIVE heat loss.

The stock manifolds are also insulated with asbestos covered with a stainless
steel shell.  That's one of the reasons they're so expensive I'ld guess.

I'll probably make a couple of heat shields.  Make two piece shields and
sanwitch some aditional insulation between them.  Any comments or
recommendations?
