That's what filters are for!  On my son's turbo I installed a =
Canton/Mecca
filter that uses a replaceable element that is good to 8 microns.  It is
also "full flow" with no bypass at all.

But cheap insurance :-)

Yes, and no.  Depending on the kind of synthetic (and how much you can
believe of the oil manufacturer's claims) certain brands will put all of
this crud in suspension, either to be filtered out harmlessly circulated
around.

I ran my '84 Audi 5000 for 160,000 miles and it never used any oil in
between changes using Mobil 1 with changes once a year, or around 12,000
miles.

I'm now using Red Line synthetic in my S2 and I'll probably change it
about every 6000 miles, even though Red Line says I can go well over
12,000.

I think too many people get hung up on oil and change intervals.  Oil is
CHEAP, even at $6-8/quart for Red Line.  Geez, if I can't afford $36 =
every
6 months, why am I driving a Porsche?
