Dear Martin,

Just a week ago I did the exact same thing!

 I changed my 16" Phone Dials on my 1988 944S to 17" Borbet C2T Replicas in
the sizes that you described. (I think my fronts were 7.5" wide but no
difference) I put Nitto 501 Exit GT's on them with 215/45ZR-17 on the front
and 255/40ZR-17 on the rear. I didn't do with the 225 in the front because I
saw that size on a 7.5"x17" rim on a 911sc and the sidewall bulged
noticeably more than the 255 would on a 9" wide rim. Also the overall tire
height would have been taller than the front than in the back and taller
than with my 16" Phone Dials (which had the stock size 205/55ZR-16
Bridgestone RE-940s). Although if you do the math with the dimensions it
wouldn't seem that they would be the same size front/rear, but when the
wheels and tires arrived mounted, they were. (Maybe the RE-71's are a little
different that the Nitto's.)

The 255's will be no problem clearance wise in the rear. They fill the
fender well up perfectly and look damn good on a 9" rim. (The 944's look
awesome front the rear with those fat 255's!!) Now on the front, check how
much clearance you have between the tire and the front spring. Depending
what kind of style of struts you have, I have been told that you may get
some rubbing with some models of 225. I played it safe and went with 215.
The sidewall height looks identical as well as equal sidewall bulge front
and fear (almost none).

In a nutshell... do some measuring... and DO IT!!! The 17" rims make the 944
look great. Now with the 255's on 9" wide rims, there is no more "skinny
rear end" look on my car. The rims, both front and rear, come out flush with
the fenders, and I can cut an onramp in half like never before!! I have
received several compliments. Any more questions, let me know! Have fun!
