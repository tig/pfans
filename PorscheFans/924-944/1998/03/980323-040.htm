I'm forwarding this for Vaughan Scott, who is having some problems with the
list on his mailserver.

---------

I've found a few items which may help those having problems with the
headlight motor and mechanism. Number one item is to check that the
headlights can move up and down freely, without rubbing the body
at any point - just have someone switch them on and off while watching
the motion from under the hood. I found that a previous front corner
accident on my 924 had messed things up just enough to cause one
headlight to bind on the body. One day, this stopped the motor and
caused the fuse to blow. 

It may be possible to adjust the mounting points of the linkage to
compensate for this, but make sure that the headlight covers still look
straight when down! I was able to acheive the desired free motion, but
the cover was askew. Since I wasn't in the mood to dissassemble and
start pounding on the sheetmetal, I just greased the panel, and voila -
good as new! The mounting points are three bolts on either side of each
headlight, as well as two bolts on each side of the linkage bar (move the
bar and motor forward and backwards, if necessary).

The next source of intermittent problems may the be connector to the
motor. If you can wiggle the connector and have the lights move up or
down as they should be (but aren't), then fixing this is a good idea.  The
contacts don't typically get dirty (they were spotless on my 20-yr old
car) due to the rubber covers, but they can get worn and loose.

Fortunately, this is a standard AMP connector. What this means is that
the plastic body and metal pins are separately replaceable. Most likely
what you'll need to do is replace the pins. There's a special little tool
used
to remove either side of the pins, which can them be cut off and a new
pin crimped on (yes, with a special crimper). These tools and
replacement pins could be bought from any decent electronics supply
house (no, probably not Radio Shack though - just check your Yellow
Pages), or you can befriend an electronics technician and borrow
his/her tools. The pins themselves are worth pennies.

To get at the female receptacles in the motor body, you'll have to remove
the motor (3 bolts) from the car and pry off the rubber boot. This is a
pain, but can be done. Once you're in there, you'll easily be able to
replace the connectors, which leads us to the last item, the diodes. You'll
see them in there, the little black cylinders. Note that they're pointed in
opposite directions. If your motor only goes one way, one of these may
be blown (especially if the motor jammed like mine did - current overload).
If you have a nice multimeter (or can borrow one ;) you can check to see
 if they are functional. Mine looked fine, but one was blown, and
disintegrated under prodding! They should flow current in one direction
only.

They can be replaced simply by soldering, very easy. You may choose
to replace both, as they're only worth maybe 10 cents each - you may
even be able to scrounge one from a friend, if you keep those kind of
friends ;)  You'll need to get the right type, but that's pretty easy -
they're
usually rated for 50VDC and up! We only need something that will handle
about 13 V DC, and at most 10 Amps. The main trick is just to find one
that will conveniently fit into the space provided - exact fit is not
required,
just so long as you can reassemble things. Make sure to solder it in in the
correct direction, just remember where the old one was going (do one at
a time).

These tips should prevent you from having to spend hundreds on a new
headlight motor or wiring harnesses... write if you have questions...
