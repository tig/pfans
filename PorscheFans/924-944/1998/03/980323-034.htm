One way to develop reflexes for that inevitable emergency situation is to
do some off-road driving, preferably not in your Porsche.  I enjoy driving
my Pathfinder on dirt and/or loose-gravel roads, and sometimes purposely
take curves a little too fast to induce a slide that can be caught with the
right throttle and steering inputs.  This sort of practice can be done at
low speeds in areas with safe runoff.  It gives you a quick education on
what throttle, brake and steering inputs do to a vehicle in a low-traction
situation, which is not too different from coming in too hot on the wrong
line on a smooth track with a well sorted out 944.
