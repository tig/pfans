For those of you sitting around watching snow fall outside your window,
keep this in mind, this last weekend was my fourth straight weekend of
racing, and the next two weekends are also race days.  It's not so bad
living up here in the frozen North as some Americans call it :)

March 1  Autocrossed at Kent
March 7  Autocrossed at Bremerton
March 14 - 15 Kart practiced/raced at Cultus Lake
March 21 - 22 Kart practiced at Tradex

March 28 - 29 Kart practice/race at Tradex
April 4 - 5 Kart practice/race at Cultus Lake

Then, I'll take a break :)  Maybe get some autocross in while I'm waiting
for the next kart day.

One kart practice weekend is about equal to running 40 auto-x events or
about 120 auto-x runs.  The only bad part about kart racing is that it
does a number on your body and muscles.  I had bruises all over my body
last week.  This week, I only have one problem area where my arm hits
the engine.  Next week, if it's dry, my coach expects Paul and I will 
have neck problems from the g'forces.
