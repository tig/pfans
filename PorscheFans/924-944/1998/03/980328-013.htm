Rennsport hasn't run an event at Mosport for a long time... five+ years 

(Gawd do I remember that event. The person supposedly in charge (me) got
instant flu Friday night, delivered a few words to the assembled Saturday
morning, and spent the rest of the weekend at the hotel bedridden. The
weather was horrid - at various times during the weekend there was rain,
drizzle, freezing rain, hail, sleet, or snow on the track. The event was
shut down early when a blizzard hit the backstraight, reducing visibility
to near zero. For some strange reason since then, I haven't been asked to
be an event organizer. People in my region are *so* superstitious. :-)

Ow. That's an issue with these hired gun pro instructors - there just
aren't enough of them to go around at one event. I know at our region the
"chosen few" must also debrief the rest of the instructors. We had Bill?
Buff here (as has UCR, I think) - a nice write-up of his visit to Rennsport
and what the "chosen" instructors learned is at

Just to avoid confusion, we call these things "lapping days" and they are
very common around here, although neither PCA region puts one on. I find
these  types of days  are great for "seat time," sorting the car out,
determining tire pressures, etc.

Eek. I refuse to go to events where participants have to flag. Why? Because
every time I've gone to an event like that, it has rained. *Every* *single*
*time*.

Me? Heh, I haven't run an event in years. The people doing it now are *way*
better and more organized than I ever was. :-) I just sit back and relax.

<plug mode: on> Come to our September driver's ed... it is a week before
the inaugural club race at Mont-Tremblant. Famous Porsche Internet
personalities like Kevin Gross and Bill Hawe make the trek annually!
Experience *real* beer <cough>, French ambience, "le faucon bleu," go-kart
racing the way it *should* be, and one of the world's prettiest (and
unfortunately, one of the bumpiest) tracks - a former home of the Canadian
GP and "a mini-Nurburgring" (Jackie Stewart). All varieties and price
levels of accomodation are available. 

Registration is now open. Last year's event sold out in July, so register
early! Registration info and more @ <http://www.seko.ca/rsrgen/oor.htm>

(Everyone's welcome to any of our events, but for the year-end one in
September has the most attendance and the best atmosphere)
