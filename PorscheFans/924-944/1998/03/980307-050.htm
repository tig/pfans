Okay, I've been listening to you guys talk about sythetic oils and the
recomended change intervals for a while now.  It's well known that
synthetics don't break down nearly as quickly as conventional oils
right?  However they do pick up dirt and contaminants at the same rate
right?  This is why you have an oil filter.  The job of the filter is to
catch the contaminants that get into your oil so as to prevent them from
circulating.  Eventually the filter gets pretty much full and some of
the cont. start circulating through the system again.  Of course if you
change the filter every 2.5k (for a cost of about $5-$10) you can leave
the expensive oil in your car for a while longer.  I've been working in
the fast oil change business for quite a while now and this is what we
recommend to customers.  We recommend this because we got a memo from
Esso a couple of years ago recommending it to us.  Does this all make
sense?
