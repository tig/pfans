Please, please, comparing the lifetime of belts (or even other aspects) 
between disimillar cars seems pointless.  What is the perspective here? 
Just because most 944 variants cost less than a new Honda Civic does not
mean that they can be compared to a Honda Civic at any level.  The cars I
occasionally see our Porsches being compared to on this list probably
spend their lifetime in the 2-3krpm range.  Is that how owners are driving
their 944s?  How is that a fair comparison? 

If you want to have fair comparisons, at least start comparing our engines
to those of Integras, 3000s and other high revving engines, that actually
see 4krpm on a regular basis, where the dealers in my area will _not_
guarantee their work when changing your timing belt unless you also
replace the water pump.

If one does not like the 944/968 belt design and still wants a high
performance leve, for the cost of a good 968 a 3*8 offering can probably
be bought so you too will have to drop the engine every 15k miles for the
minor scheduled maintenance.  Or get a 95 M3 so you too can put it in 1st
gear instead of 3rd at 50mph and rev the engine waaaaay past redline since
the tranny likes to occasionally shift on its mount(s) in the corners. Or
there is the low-tech approach, one could buy two or three British sports
cars featuring Lucas, the Prince of Darkness.  When one does not work,
just drive another one. 

There are many options when it comes to fun cars, but I have yet to find
one that is truly bullet-proof.  Find something you like and put up with
its faults.  You will forget about them at the next curve you take with
your eyes wide open, the engine screaming, the smell of hot oil and rubber
in the air and the feel of the car in your hands.
