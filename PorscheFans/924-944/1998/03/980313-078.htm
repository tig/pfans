Randy:

Sorry to keep bothering you but a few comments/questions as respects
your responses to Mark/PFans:

**Ask all the questions you want.  I like getting e-mail and it makes me
feel important even though I don't know much.  I do like talking and
reading about ways to make Porsches go faster.  I know its hard to find
good reliable info and this list is the best place I've found(along with
PowerHouse).


1.5 bar!!!!  That is some serious boost (21+ psi)!!  Have you upgraded
the injectors to handle the increased fuel requirements?  I've heard
that the stock injectors are running at over 90% at 17psi.  In
addition, in the latest issue of European Car, they have an
interesting article on calculating injector size
based on current/projected horsepower and vice-versa.  I don't have
the formula handy but will post in on Monday for the list's use.

**David Reins at PH is running almost 400HP to the rear wheels on stock
injectors.  I think I'm going to install the mixture gauge just to see
if I may be running lean.  I just don't have a good place in the car to
put it.


When I try to run more than 1.1 (16 psi) of boost, the car starts to
ping, even though I've used Sunoco Ultra 94 since buying the car.  Any
suggestions on why this would happen?  I'm thinking it could be
because the head has been milled twice but I still don't think my
compression is as high as yours.

**I ran 24lbs for two months with k26 stock turbo and stock head and the
car ran great.  I used a bottle of 104 octane boost in a tank of gas.  I
tried a smaller boost bolt and hit 30lbs and blew the head gasket.  That
is when I started the more serious mods, I had to pull the head anyway.
I'm sure I could run more boost now but am afraid something might break.



Also, have you installed the Wide Ring Fire Gasket to help avoid blown
head gaskets?

** Yes, and the O-ringed head.


Finally, I've read about the usage of the "993 Compressor Bypass
Valve" for 951s.  What does this do?  Part #?  Price?

** It doesn't do anything if your 944 part is working correctly but many
are not.  If you take it off and can blow through it, it is bad and
boost is bleeding off through it.  The 993 part has a better diaphragm
but looks almost the same and does the same but will probably last
longer.  When you let off the throttle after boosting, the boost
pressure remaining between the turbo pump and the throttle body is bled
off through this valve otherwise it will try to go back through the
turbo which slows the turbine between gear shifts.  I don't know the
part number but it has been posted before.  Call PowerHouse and ask
David, he will know and they are fairly inexpensive.
