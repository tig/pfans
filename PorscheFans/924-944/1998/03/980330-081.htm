I have been looking for years for a book on the military  Volkswagen vehi=
cles=0Athat played a role in World War II, and I have found a jewel of a =
book in:=0AVOLKSWAGENS OF THE WEHRMACHT. 

The book illustrates the first civilian Volkswagens before the war, the u=
se of=0Athe Volkswagens in the war by the German Wehrmacht (German Army) =
and the=0Aoccupying forces after the war. Also covered in great detail is=
 the automobile=0Adevelopment of the Beetle project, various experiments =
of the =9120=92s and =9130=92s=0Ato realize the Volkswagen concept. This =
book not only shows the history of=0AVolkswagen, but also a chapter in Ge=
rman history. 

This book has some or the rarest of the =93early-years=94 of Volkswagen-W=
erk. Ever=0Asee a Kubelwagen with a half track and pontoon skis? How abou=
t a dummy decoy=0Atank based on a VW chassis complete with tank turret? H=
ow about a VW railcar=0Athat can travel along rail road rail and the stre=
et? How about a extended=0A(long) wheelbase Schwimmwagen (type 128) that =
can carry six of your closest=0Afighting buddies and gear? How about a Be=
etle that runs a natural gas? How=0Aabout one that runs on coal? How abou=
t a 4WD Beetle (with 6 inches of extra=0Aground clearance!) ? I found thi=
s book fascinating reading for hours on end.=0ALots of photos taken by th=
e very same German soldiers having fun with their=0Acars in the combat zo=
ne. We talking about the original thing here folks! 

This book is a jewel in any Volkswagen book collection!  Many pictures of=
=0AFerdinand and Ferry Porsche meeting with the German SS high command an=
d their=0Amighty Fueher. The Porsches always wearing a certain fear in th=
eir eye look on=0Atheir faces!  If your into VW=92s you will love this bo=
ok! I do!!

by Simon Parkinson
hard-bound, 8=94 by 9=94
128 pages, B&W photos

ISBN #1-874105-47-2

This book tells the extraordinary story of the Volkswagen-Werk and the=0A=
production of the beloved Beetle the early years, both pre- and post-  W.=
W.II=0Auntil the late 1940=92s. Photos of the  plant VW-Werk, being const=
ructed in town=0Aof KDF-Stat. Hitler laying the corner stone. Rare models=
 of the VW-Werk plant.=0APrototype Beetle models, built by MB in Stuttgar=
t. Even photos of the=0Aproduction line assembling Kubelwagen=92s during =
the war years. And then onto=0AMajor Ivan Hirst, the British soldier who =
took on the task of rebuilding VW-=0AWerk factory after the ashes had fal=
len. Even pictures of plant after the=0Aallied bomb raids, showing how th=
e crafty Germans kept the machine shop under=0Aground inside of a tunnel =
network! 

The book concentrates mainly on the production facilities and the people=
=0Abehind the scenes who made the production of the Beetle happen after t=
he war.=0AIt kind of boggles the mind how the Germans kept building that =
little car year=0Aafter year even without a roof on the VW-Werk Plant! Lo=
ts of detailed pictures=0Aof the various stamping machines and workers al=
ong the line. This is a great=0Awealth of knowledge in those early years =
of teething the plant up and running!

Enjoy!
