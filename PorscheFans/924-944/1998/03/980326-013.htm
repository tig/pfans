Now this is the kind of timing belt question that belongs here.

Stu, I hate to tell you buddy, but it appears you have a bad timing belt.
If it is not turning while the crankshaft is, it's toast.  I'm not sure if
the normally aspirated 924 is designed to convert all 8 valves into so many
bent roofing nails upon such an occasion, or not.  My 931 engine definitely is.
Someone today has said that the 924 and 931 camshafts are the same.  If that's
truly the case, some serious cylinder head service is probably in your future.

Hopefully your eyesight is not what it used to be and the belt is turning.
In this case, I would suspect the fuel pump relay has failed.  After cranking
the engine, turn the key off and listen for any humming around the gas tank.
It will stop in a second or two after the key is turned to the off position.
No sound at all means no fuel pump action at all.  The relay fails more often 
than the fuel pump.  The relay is under the dash and costs about US$30 for
the 924; US$80 for the 931.

Good luck.
