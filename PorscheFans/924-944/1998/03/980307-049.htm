First of all, thanks to the many who took the time to respond. Eventually I
will be incorporating what was written into a how-to article on installing
an accusump for my local region's newsletter (and which I'll put on my web
site).

So...

1. The general consensus seems to be that the oil pump is not the culprit
as I stated but my rather flippant reasoning why is flawed.

2. I was a bit surprised only one other person related they had spun #2.
Perhaps this has become a non-issue?

3. Excessive crankcase pressure was proposed as a culprit. This is a
possibility I hadn't thought of but does make sense. (Hey! How many of you
knew that running negative crankcase pressure will give you more
horsepower? The problem is finding a vacuum source under WOT...)

4. I was somewhat inaccurate in talking about the crank. I said
"cross-drilling" when I really meant "moving and/or chamfering and/or
cross-drilling." It also isn't clear whether Mr. Milledge does this as I
now have people claiming he does and others that he doesn't. Perhaps it is
best to remove reference to his name here. It has been my experience that
professional engine builders like to keep things to themselves and I will
respect that.

5. The ultimate solution is a dry sump, but of course that is beyond the
wallets and expertise of most, and is probably not allowed in the
showroom-stock type racing many of us are interested in.
