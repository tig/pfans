Steve,

Stable Energies sells the I/O Port Racing harness guide bar, video camera mount.
You can order this mount from either Stable Energies or I/O Port Racing.  I
believe it is $89.00 plus shipping.  It does come with a nylon webbing strap to
help minimize vibration.  I recommend it.

I/O Port's phone number is (510) 254-RACE or 1-800-949-5712.  They are located in
Lafayette, CA.
Stable Energies is located in New Jersey, but don't let that discourage you.  They
are extremely polite and the girl I spoke with on the phone didn't even have a
Jersey accent.  Probably didn't have BIG HAIR either. (just kidding, people from
Jersey).  Stable Energie's phone number is (973)773-3177.  Or they are on the web
@ www.stable-energies.com.
