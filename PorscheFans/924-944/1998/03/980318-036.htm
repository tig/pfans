The 3rd gear runs have lines all over the place.  The torque numbers are
very low at the bottom and are unusual in their shape.  Whatever the case,
the 4th gear ones are the ones I like to use.

There is no easy answer to your problems.  You have to start with the first
suggestion and work from there.

Your comments come across pretty harsh, but do understand that when you
modify a car, you have to become the engineer, the R&D person and the
race car driver all at once.  Since you've been dealing with Powerhaus,
continue to bug them about your concerns until they deal with them.
