David,

I have rebuilt the turbo on my 931 twice.  The rebuild kits are $170-200 and
contain a few special (and important) parts and mostly run-of-the-mill nuts,
bolts, washers, etc.  The problem is, I've not been able to find those special 
parts anywhere else, like the turbo shaft oil seal rings and the sleeve 
bearings.  These KKK turbos can be rebuilt by the careful home mechanic with
a good set of tools.  The most difficult operation, I think, is pressing the
shaft out of the compressor blades.  This is required to get the whole works
out of the bearing housing.  Take care to mark the position of the compressor
blades on the shaft so that it can be returned to that same position when you
re-install it.  The spinning assembly is balanced.

If your impeller (exhaust side) is coated with silica deposits, have it bead
blasted to remove those deposits.  I did not do this the first time and soon
found odd vibrations at spin up.  MAKE SURE TO PROTECT THE BEARING AND OIL RING
SURFACES ON THE SHAFT WHEN BEAD BLASTING THE IMPELLER.  And, don't even think
about sand blasting.  It can erode and ruin the impeller.
