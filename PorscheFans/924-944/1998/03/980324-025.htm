Well, I sold my 951 last week, and I wanted to thank everyone who has
helped me with tech questions and advice in the past.  The PorscheFans
list has made the Porsche ownership experience that much more
gratifying.  I plan to continue reading and contributing to the digest
when I can, especially since I'm considering a 968 next and need to keep
abreast on current info.  Besides, this list has become a daily ritual
for me over the past 2 years and I'll miss all you folks!  I've advised
the new owner of my car to get involved with this list, so please be as
patient and helpful with him as you all have been with me.  Thanks, and
happy motoring!

Ben
