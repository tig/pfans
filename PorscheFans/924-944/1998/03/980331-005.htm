Recently,  I have read many articles expressing there discontent with the 
list specifically relating the content and number of messages.  Personally, 
I find any information very informative and yes, occasionally there are 
repeat questions previously discussed.  Members should refer to the Porsche 
FAQ's prior asking their questions as they might have already been 
answered.  

I am very satisfied with the list and make the following recommendations 
for reading and posting messages:

1)  Open your messages files; Select EDIT from the menu and the FIND 
option.  Type in 'subject' for the item you are looking for and select OK.  
 This will hit each message at the Subject line and thus makes cruising 
though the list fast.  These instructions apply to MS WORD but should be 
generic enough in any word processor.

2) All members, please make your Subject field specific.

3) Some way of compiling the list by subject content.  Perhaps even ZIP 
files with specific discussion topics??

P.S.  Thanks for all who replied on my Climate Control Question
