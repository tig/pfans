Just wanted the list to know that you can trust list member Gary Stone
(Isthmus1 @aol.com) to sell you parts.  I bought some Turbo S wheels from him
last week.  Not only was the price fair, but the wheels were exactly as
represented, and he packed them up very well for shipment and sent them just
when promised.  I didn't know Gary at all before this experience, but wouldn't
hesitate to deal with him again.  Just thought you guys and gals should know.
