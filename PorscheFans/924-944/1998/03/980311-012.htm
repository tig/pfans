Rich and P-Fans,

Rich Freitas asked about the Historics and as it's been a while since I let
the list know about this P-Fans event I'm sending this overview to everyone
again. If you love Porsches, you might very well be interested in joining
us.....

This is the 25th year of the Monterey Historic Car Races, which makes them
one of the oldest in the country. At a historic race, old race cars and
their owners have a way to "exercise" on the track and spectators can come
and see those cars again -- or maybe see them for the first time. The clubs
that sanction the events have certain rules regarding who's allowed to
participate, and most importantly on actions on the track. If a driver makes
metal to metal contact, he's immediately on probation. If it happens again,
he's out. Obviously, the goal is to preserve these wonderful, old cars.

As you may already know, Porsche is celebrating 50 years as a manufacturer
this year and a big part of that celebration will be focused on Monterey
where they will be the honored marquee. Translated, lots of old race
Porsches on the track. Reportedly, Porsche is "emptying" their Zuffenhausen
museum to insure nearly every significant race and street Porsche is on
display or on the track in Monterey.

The local club, Monterey Bay Region, is also offering a variety of
activities including a Welcoming Dinner on Friday evening at the Carmel
Mission with up to 40 former and current Porsche race car drivers in
attendance for discussion and autographs. There will also be historic cars
on display and this event is limited to 2000 people. MBR will also be
organizing a dedicated parking area for Porsche owners who drive their cars
to the races -- Porsche Corral. This will be limited to 800 Porsches and
many of us P-Fans attending will be grouped together in the corral. Imagine,
800 Porsches parked in a row!!! I've heard the corral is already 1/2 full
and is expected to sell out, as is the dinner. For complete information on
this event checkout the February issue of Panorama (pp. 24-28) and there is
an application for the MBR events on page 81.

I'm coordinating "spreading the word" to list members and currently there
are about 35 924/944/968 PorscheFans on my list who are planning to attend
the Monterey Historics. In addition to attending many of the things Porsche
has planned, the P-Fans will also be meeting for dinner on Saturday evening
at a local Porsche/racing theme restaurant to admire each other's cars, sip
margaritas, and swap 924/944/968 stories.

And if all this isn't enough, there is also the Christie's and Blackhawk
Auto Auctions, the Concours Italiano (which will also have an entire fairway
of Porsches on display) and of course the famous Pebble Beach Concours
d'Elegance also going on over the same week in August-- 13th thru the15th.

If you can't make it to Monterey, you may be interested in one of the other
events Porsche will be participating in this year. They will also be
participating in other historic races around the country such as
Waterford/Meadowbrook in Michigan on August 1&2; Watkins Glen August 28-30
and a concours on Amelia Island in Florida on April 18th.

Anyone interested in more information on Monterey should contact me
immediately. Hotels will sell out completely and most of the other
activities/events are also expected to sell out. Make your plans now!
