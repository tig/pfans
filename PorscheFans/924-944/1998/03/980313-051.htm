answer the following questions, it would be appreciated:

assume this means that you have a boost controller of some type.  Is
it manual or digital (like the HKS and GReddy units)?

 I have mounted the manual regulator in side...next to shifter...this
allows me to "dial" a specific boost pressure at any given time...I
like the fact that I can controll the pressure especially in certain
racing situations...NOW...not everyone thinks as highly as the
Turbonetics product as I...I use their DeltaGate II...I had to request
a lighter spring (normal is 9 pounds) because of my set up...mine is 5
pounds

You might want to clarify this w/Turbonetics...I have one
valve/chamber  

>>3.  Did you experience any fitment problems with the wastegate or
did you have to modify it in any way?
 
There was some minor mods needed...nothing difficult...pipe bender and
welder
  
> > 4.  Are you aware of any wastegate "creep"?  What kind of boost
levels are you running?
 
The settings start...for me...@ 12 lbs (regulator fully closed)...I
have dialed in as high as 20 lbs...not for long...the way we have the
car set up...15-17 pds w/ the new MAFS provides for one hellava ride.
 
> > 5.  Finally, HOW MUCH???

 Approx. $500?
