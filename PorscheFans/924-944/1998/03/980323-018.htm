Scotchbright also slowly disintegrates as you use it.  Be sure to clean off all

certain items, I'd clean something with it, then the next day the item would

I don't exactly know what the coating is for.  I assume to have a smooth layer
of silicon for the pistons.  I don't know if it wears away.

The people who reapplied to it my block dropped some of the paste on my cradle.
 To make things short, I couldn't get it off.  (it was very hard, and must have
formed some bond with the aluminum)
