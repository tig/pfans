paul,having just finished doing the head on my 79 924, i can tell you,
no you can't assume that the cam is set right.BEFORE YOU INSTALL THE
HEAD!
what you do is turn the cam pully so the #1 (front) cam lobes are set
for TDC.HAS CAM BEEN PRELUBED. STP ON THE JOURNALS AND CAM LOBES
SO AS IT TURNS IT LUBES THE TOWERS.
make sure the #1 cyl. is at TDC(check for timing marks on crank and
flywheel,if only one is showing thats TBC,or #4 up)is the manifold off
the exhaust pipe? make it so.you can reach them with a 10mm and a long
extention.it's the right to do it.
now you can install exhaust manifold to the head while head is still
off, as there isn't enough room to move the manifold back away from the
head once it's in.  that't why you some times find missing manifold
bolts, they couldn't get the man. on with all bolts in place.
gaskets in,oil guides,one at each lower corner?
install the head and mani. together, not heavy at all.
tighten bolts to spec. 79lb. cold?
INSTALL THE TIMING BELT. DON'T TURN THE CRANK WITHOUT IT.
now, check the gap on the tappets with a feeler guage.
intake are the front of each pair .04mm cold.
back is exh. .16mm cold. thats .010in. and .040in respectivly.
they can be adjusted with a 2.5 or 3mm allen key and alot of time.
a 1 in. socket  will turn the crank to bring the next pair of valves to
the closed position, check them and so on.
gaskets on? install intake mani. and all other bits and pieces, valve
cover and hook up wires exh.pipe. is the distributor in?cold start valve
and all those other little buggers you can't reach behind the head?crank
it with high tens.wire off distrib.(crank by hand a couple of times to
make sure timing marks are matching.if they are crank with key short
bursts to bring up oil.
if everything is plugged in and your fingers are crossed it should start
the first time, if not check all wires and vac. lines.
good luck, ed.
