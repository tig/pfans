I ended up taking the car to a so-called reputable shop in the Toronto Area
and was taken for a ride for $1000.00 for no work done.  Just an
inspection.  I was quite disappointed.  That's when I called "Whaletail
Productions" and spoke to the owner Randy Meyer.  He explained what I had
to do to deal with my situation, then picked up my car in Toronto and
brought it out to Waterloo (His location) where he found me a new motor,
installed it and then returned the car to me.  He has since helped me out
in finding many parts and advised me on the best course of action regarding
maintenance and repairs.  He is one of those people who believes in helping
people for the sake of helping and not to always "turn a buck"  I highly
recommend Whaletail Productions for parts you may need.  I have listed the
phone numbers below.<

I'll second that. I have known Randy since before he saw the light (he once
worked on British cars). He started this business out the sheer enjoyment
of working with the cars he likes and is very resourceful and helpful.
