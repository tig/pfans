Not that I mind, but perhaps the extended banter (like the bra
thread) could be moved over to the Tavern list.  If you wanted
the banter then you'd get it, and if you didn't want it, you
wouldn't see it. That would keep everyone happy.

To move a thread over, perhaps people could send an e-mail to 
the poster and copy the Tavern list.  (Copying both lists might 
lead to the dreaded repeating message problem).
