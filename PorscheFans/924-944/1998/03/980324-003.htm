15% of spec'd tolerance each time.  Granted, I have alot of racing and
wrenching experience, but I feel that any person with good mechanical
aptitude, patience, good tools, common sense and who pays attention can do
his own belts.<

While 15% is probably pretty good for adjusting the belts by hand, it is
not within the factory tolerances for either a new or previously run in
timing belt. They don't normally pull those specs./tolerances out of the
air. The bottom line is -- if you feel you're lucky enough or good enough
to do the timing belts without the tool, you should probably fly to Vegas
and bet $3000 on RED.
