Jim,

Maybe I should have been more specific.  MY airbag light comes on every time I
or anyone else disconnects MY battery.  It has happened numerous times at the
alarm and stereo shop, at the dealer and at home.  The little wire and
stopwatch trick does not work on MY 968 as it does on the 944.  DON"T ASK ME
HOW I KNOW?
