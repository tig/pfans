Eben
The best $120 I spent on My Porsche was a complete set of hoses from A J
USA. They took all day to install but it was well worth it. I had a leak
in one hose, fixed that then another hose decided to leak At this point
I decided to change them all. Anyway AJ USA can be reached at
1-800-877-1911. The price for your car is $72.95.
