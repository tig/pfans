Subject: Re: GReddy Boost Control
  The local rice burner builder in Memphis is the one that convinced me to
go
with the GReddy, although they like the HKS also.  They said there was no
reason to go with an aftermarket wastegate unless I'm getting boost
creep(sounds like a disease).  The biggest problem is finding where to
mount
the unit inside car.  I'm thinking about removing equalizer and putting
unit
there.  Thanks for the input Jim.
Randy Morton>>>
The HKS in my car is mounted on the driver's side window pillar just above
the dash. Although it does seem to "stare you in the face", it is not
obtrusive.
It is also much, much easier to check your boost in this position than it
would be in a dash mounted unit. I recall you are working with a K-27, Mass
Flow Sensor and APE II chip set-up. My car is likewise set-up and even with
only 15 lbs. of boost it would not be easy for me to glance down at the
center console as I row through the gears.
I beleive you will also find the guage to be extremely accurate and very
reliable.
Best regards.
