I noticed coolant leaking out of bottom of pan under engine, not visible
elsewhere at all. Should I presume it to be coming from the water pump,
which is less than 3 years old, but the seals were said not to be replaced
at the time? It is a rebuilt, I believe.

For further localizing this leak I presume the next step is to remove the
cover from the timing belt, correct? And further presume that there is
nothing to be gained by removing the pan under the engine?

Who is a reliable source for rebuilt pump? I have the Zim's phone and have
used them, if they are one of the best. Thanks.
