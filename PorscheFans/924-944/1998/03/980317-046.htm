Robert,
When I was in Champaign I had Rick Karch work on my 83 944 and was very
satisfied with his service.  He did not have to do anything major and I
knew much less about the car then than I do now (thanks in part to this
group) but I was satisfied none the less.  I have also taken my car in to
the dealer in Peoria/Pekin.  The labor rates are certainly much lower than
here in Chicago (~$45/hour vs $75/hour) but they are not exceptionally
flexible or customer oriented.  They seemed to do a reasonably good job
though.
Chris
