Hello,
Over the past few days there has been alot of discussion concerning the
upgrade to H4 headlights, and guess what, yesterday I blew a headlight. So
today, I spend almost all day dragging my wife and two sons all over Orange
County, CA. looking for this upgrade kit. Well, we were finally succesful. A
Porsche only parts distributor had the upgrade kit for $80. This included the
two H4 bulbs 12V 60/55W and the two headlights. The diamond blue bulbs were
found at a local motorsports shop. They were $12 each. They actually work very
well. There is a definate resemblance to the new Porsche headlights. The
patterns are identical. 
The distributor that had the kit was Best Deal Porsche Parts in stanton, Ca.
They carry just about anything you could want for our cars, and they have
hundreds of parts cars sprawled over their facility. Their number is
714-995-0081.

Thank you,
Terry
