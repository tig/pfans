Hang on a sec. This could make PCA events very interesting if Porsche made
SUVs and all Porsches can participate in PCA events.  A reasonably
low-slung Porsche SUV with full-time AWD and 250-300 hp would make things
exciting on the track. Wonder what class they'd race in?  A bunch of
Porsche SUVs with lightweight tubular bumpers fore and aft could bring a
new dimension to Club racing.  Not something you'd want to challenge in a
corner.
