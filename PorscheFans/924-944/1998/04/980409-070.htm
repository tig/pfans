This reminded me of a problem I had with my 87 924S that I purchased in
the summer of 1990.  Beginning in the Fall of 1990 some mornings it
would run rough or not at all.  If allowed to warm up the problem would
go away.  The local Porsche dealer made two attempt to fix it with out
success.  One morning I decide I would try trouble shooting it myself.
What I found was that when it was cold the Flap in the Air Flow Sensor
would bind and then free up when warm.  I removed the Air Flow Sensor
and placed it in the freezer.  The next morning I took it to the dealer
any showed them what I thought the problem was.  They ordered a new Air
Flow Sensor and replaced it under  the emission warranty.  So far I have
not had another fuel injection problem.
