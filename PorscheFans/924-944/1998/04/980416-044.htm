Has anyone attempted to light these switches and/or the window switches? My
968 is the same way (only the locking switch illuminates) and is tough to
find the switches sometimes at night.  Are 911s this way also?

Clive,

Of all those switches only the locks actually light up.

Discovered a broken 'T' connector coming off the vacuum hose going to my   
brake booster.  Don't know how I missed that the first time...  This   
brings up a two more questions.  This T connector off my brake line is   
unknown to my parts guy (not in the drawings).  It has a small nipple   
that goes off to a black canister next to my battery.  What is that?  It   
looks original but the T connector going to it has a little VW on it.

Question 2.  While searching through all the hoses and connections, I got   
a good look at all the rubber under the intake manifold.  Scary.  From   
the looks of these hoses, I will not take any long trips until they have   
been replaced.  Can someone give me an idea of the amount of time I'll   
need to get the manifold off?  Should I be able to get this all done on a   
Saturday?  Is there anything else I should take care of while I've got it   
apart?
Sorry thats more then two.  I wish I was going to the chile cookoff.  I   
hope you have a Texas representative.
