>Possible SUV In Porsche's Lineup?
>Currently in negotiations with Volkswagen AG and an unnamed foreign 
company,
>Porsche AG hopes to make a decision about a new SUV in the next few 
weeks.
>
>GENEVA (Reuters)-Shares in German luxury carmaker Porsche AG jumped 
more
>than 3 percent on Tuesday after it revised profit and sales figures 
upward
>and said it was in talks to build a sport-utility vehicle (SUV).
>Management board chairman Wendelin Wiedeking told Reuters that the 
company
>was having discussions with Volkswagen AG and an unnamed foreign 
company to
>develop the SUV. "We are negotiating with Volkswagen but details have 
not
>been agreed," Wiedeking said.
>Asked about the outlook for the company's financial performance in the
>1997/1998 year to July 31, Wiedeking said Porsche's full-year result 
would
>amount to at least double the company's first-half profit.
>Porsche earlier revised upwards its first-half figures, saying 
after-tax
>profit for the first six months to January 31 increased to 69.7 million
>marks ($38.5 million) from 38.4 million marks in the same period the
>previous year. Sales were up 10.2 percent at 1.96 billion marks. 
Porsche had
>previously said that first-half profits were 65 million marks on sales 
of
>1.95 billion marks.
>Wiedeking told Reuters in an interview that Porsche would decide 
whether it
>would go ahead with the project, and with which partner, in the next 
few
>weeks. He also said that if the project goes forward, the two companies
>would develop a joint platform but each would market its own brand of
>vehicle.
>Wiedeking said the arrangement would help offset costs of developing 
the new
>car and that it would not increase capital to finance the project. 
Porsche
>currently makes only two models of car and a sport-utility vehicle 
would
>mark the firm's first venture away from sports cars.
>Analysts said cooperation between Porsche and Volkswagen would be 
positive.
>"We definitely welcome this solution because Porsche and VW operate at 
a
>similarly high-technological level," analysts at ABN Amro wrote in a
>commentary.
>Porsche also said it expected to shorten average waiting times for its 
cars
>to six months by the end of 1998, from the current time of one year for 
some
>models.
