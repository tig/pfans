For those of you that are planning on attending next weeks Swap Meet =
sponsored by the Central Pennsylvania chapter of the PCA, we should =
meet.   This will be held in Hershey Pennsylvania.  The club has a tent =
at this event, this would be a natural spot to get together.  I propose =
getting together at 10:00 A.M. at the PCA tent.  I have to do my thing =
for the club from 6 till 10.  I know Steve Timmons is going to be =
selling stuff from the several spots that he has acquired.  We can =
always then go walk over to his site.  Any better ideas?  I look forward =
to hearing from those of you that plan on attending.  This is the first =
year for the Hershey site, and I know the organizer has been working =
very hard on making this work smoothly.
