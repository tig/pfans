Here is my problem. I changed my fuel filter while I recently had the
tank out.  Put everything back together and the blasted fuel filter
connection is leaking.  The connection that is leaking is the one that
goes from the "out" side of the fuel filter to the line that runs to the
front of the car.

I am not sure why it is leaking but I am thinking that the connector on
the hose is the problem.  How hard is it to remove this hose and replace.
 Does this involve removing the transanxle or can it be done without
removing the transaxle?  I just put the blasted thing back in and I don't
want to take it out again.  I am just asking so I can get an idea as to
what type of cost I am looking at.

Thanks for all your help.
