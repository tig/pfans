Well, the new beastie has finally arrived, and, as the custom here, it's new
life begins by having me rip it apart and obsess on the pieces that aren't
absolutely perfect.

Of course, the car was damaged in transit, and, of course the shipper denies
any liability (sigh, should have spent the extra $$ for an enclosed
carrier).

Anyway, here's my list of used part needs.  If you have these parts in 'as
new' condition, and want to sell, send private e-mail or fax to me and
perhaps we'll do some business.

For reference, the car is black inside and out,

Here goes:

Sunroof (probably cheaper to get the whole thing than to repair)
Carpet (only need hatch area, but will consider total replacement if the
price is right)
Rectangular covers for screws on dash trim (these things are BRITTLE)
Circular climate control cover on dash
Glove box door stops (wasn't someone selling aluminum replacements for
these?)
Console between driver and passenger seats (complete)
Rt. Front fender (damaged in transit #$%*&!)
Fan Knob (It came partially broke and I finished the job - more brittle
plastic!)
Leather shift boot (must be perfect or I'll just buy it new)
Porsche sport seats or aftermarket racing (sparco, momo, Koing)
Blaupunkt CD or cassette (hate aftermarket radios!)
Engine undertray (more shipping damage?)
Misc. interior black screws and screw covers
Lt. wiper arm nut cover
Door lock buttons w/LED
Drivers side door sill cover, carpet cover/clamp
Dashboard (un-cracked!)

It sounds worse than it is, but I'm so anal about these cars.  In the shop
this week for mechanical review & triage.  I'm refreshing the brakes (BTW
*excellent prices by 'By design' in L.A. on genuine Parts, they have an 888
# - nice people & worth calling)

Anyway, thanks for the attention.
