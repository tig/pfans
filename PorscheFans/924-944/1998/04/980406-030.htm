Has anyone replaced the gauge faces on their 85.5 or newer 944. I have been
trying to locate a set in white. I've been told by Hollywood Speedometer and
Palo Alto Speedometer that they do not do any faces for the 944's. I
understand that the faces are all on a one piece panel and the face plate
that fits over the front of the instrument panel makes it appear like
individual gauge faces. NOPI used to carry overlays in various colors but I
spoke with them today and the individual I spoke with said they no longer
carry those items. Any help would be appreciated as the car is going into
the dealers this week to have some work done that requires removing the
instrument cluster. Also, does anyone know where I can get a K&N cone filter
setup for my 90 944S2?
