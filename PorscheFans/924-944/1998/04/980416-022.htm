Greetings from down under folks.

Here is a question for the 951 aficionados on the list. The following =
information is taken straight out of the spec books and I would be =
interested to hear other folks views on the matter.

The 220hp 951 had a 22.5mm solid stabiliser in the front (this went up =
to 25.5 in 1987). You also had options of 24mm tubular, 25.5mm tubular, =
and 26.8mm tubular (M030).  The rear bar was 18mm standard and I think =
the M030 had a 20mm bar.

For the 250hp model (and the S2) the front bar went up to 26.8mm =
standard but the rear bar went down to 16mm standard.

So the question is, did Porsche increase the size of the torsion bar in =
the rear with the later 951 or was this reduction of 2mm on the standard =
car to make the handling better for the 'average road punter'?

Be very interested to know your thoughts.

Rgds

Azim
