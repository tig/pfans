Sorry, I have to disagree.  I use a bra and mirror covers on my black 968
most of the summer.  Last year I received comments as to how "cool" it may
my car appear.  It may help that both the car and the bar are black and I
think the bra on the 968 looks more integrated than the bra on a 944.  Just
my .02.

I tried using the bra at the track but broke one of the inside hood
hold-downs at speed.  This year I am going to attempt to rig  the bra so it
will withstand the mph.  One of the track days without the bra a piece flew
off the car in front of me and put a 3" scratch (down to the primer) and
dent in the hood.  If the bra had been on this wouldn't have happened.

Kurt,

I would agree with Rox, The bra makes the car look "tacky" for lack of a
better term. However if your going on the track I highly recommend one
as well as the mirror bra's
just my not so humble opinion
