I don't believe your son drives his car much though, he works waaay too
hard.

It's not to blow off steam.  If my car breaks again, *I* want to be the
one the break it.  People are always breaking my cars, I never get to have
fun breaking them.  I had someone crash my third Talon at an auto-x, Paul
was driving my Talon when the turbo's compressor wheel let go, and now my
944T self destructs while in the shop.  I'm saying this sarcastically
of course, I don't want it to break regardless of who's driving.

We don't have that lump sitting back there, who needs 315's :)
