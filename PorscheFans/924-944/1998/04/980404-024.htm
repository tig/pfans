I was preparing my 944 for a track event and decided to change the brake
fluid.  Since paying somebody else to do it is so much more convenient than
doing it myself, I called around and found a local brake shop that has a
machine to flush the system.  They charge $30, which I thought was a great
deal.  No hassle, no old fluid to discard, etc.

When I got there, the shop manager refused to change the fluid on my car
since Porsche specified DOT3 or DOT4 brake fluid.  He said that DOT3 and
DOT4 are incompatible and he has no way telling which one is in my system.
He said that they put DOT3, which they have in their machine, in a DOT4
system once and ended up replacing that guy's entire brake system since it
destroyed all the seals.

Since both of them, DOT3 and DOT4 are glycol based, I have a hard time
believing that they are incompatible.  Wouldn't have Porsche have chosen
different specifiacations in this case?  Did the mechanic confused this
with DOT5?

Any input?

Clemens
