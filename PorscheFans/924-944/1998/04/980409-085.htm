>I would appreciate
information regarding The Collective's experience with factory
options(cup car?), as well as aftermarket clutches (Centerforce DF,
Sachs, others?).<

Go with the Cup Car disc.  I tried a custom Kevlar lined disc made by
Clutch Specialities in L.A..  After a few hundred miles it started
slipping.  We knew it was not the pressure plate as the wizard at Clutch
Specialities had the tension on the spring fingers increased.  Mr. Clutch=

Specialities babbled something about me not breaking the clutch in
correctly.  Of course he had included no break in instructions and would
not return our calls to tell us how it should of been broken in.  Mr.
Clutch would not return my engine builders calls and has never replaced t=
he
Kevlar disc.  I left a message on his machine that I wanted a refund or I=

would toast his butt on the Internet.  When someone mentions aftermarket
clutch, I will be happy to spread the word about Mr. Ethical at Clutch
Specialities Ripoff Artists.

Not having the brains to dump piss out of a boot, I installed a  sintered=

bronze puck racing disc on our S2.  It will not explode like the stock di=
sc
but is almost impossible to drive smoothly on the street.  When you take
off from a start the car jumps like a frog.  The plan is to replace the
disc with a stock unit.  No squawk with this clutch builder as he told us=

it would be grabby.  Like a fool, I didn't listen.

So I would suggest you stay away from aftermarket clutches.  Before the
bozo at Clutch Specialities got my money, he told my builder that he
supplied  custom discs to several Porsche parts sellers and knew all abou=
t
Porsche clutches.  It appears he didn't know much about Porsche clutches
but that wouldn't stop this guy from selling discs.  Stick with the Sachs=

Cup clutch and avoid the learning curve.
