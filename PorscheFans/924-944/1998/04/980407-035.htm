Hi P-Fans,

On thursday of last week i/we finished installing the new suspension
on my '91 S2 (non-M030). We started work on wednesday morning 0900h.


Day 1:
Our very first job was to measure the *loaden* angle of the rear trailing=

blade, cause the rear torsion bars also should be upgraded on day two.

For not to start with the most difficult things we decided to work on my
front suspension first. We replaced the stock parts (26.8mm sway bar, spr=
ings
and Sachs shocks) with the following:
- progressive turbo cup springs (w/ spacers)
- adjustable yellow Koni S2 gas sport shocks (1237 L/R Sport)
- 30mm sway bar from the 968 M030 package
A Weltmeister front strut brace was also installed.

Doing the front was very easy but a little time consuming cause i [softwa=
re
developer ;-))] did most of the work myself. My mechanic acted as supervi=
sor
and gave me tips what bolts to loosen in what order and so on.

On wednesday afternoon i started to disassemble the rear suspension of
my car. With the exception of the 2 bolts for height adjustment on my
car's left trailing blade all bolts were rather "easy" to remove. So were=

the drive shafts which i wanted to re-grease and re-install vice versa.


Day 2:
At 0900h we took a BIG wrench (1m shaft length) to loosen the last 2 rema=
ining
bolts on the rear trailing blade. When they came loose i continued to
disassemble the brake lines and hand brake cables which are connected
above the torsion bar tube to each other. Soon after that i had the
rear suspension completely dismounted and we measured the rear trailing
blades unloaden angle. After loosening the torsion tube, we exchanged
the torsion bars and indexed the new ones to the calculated unloaden
angle. I assembled parts of the rear suspension (set the height adjustmen=
t
to middle position) put on the tires, un-jacked the car from the lift...
measured... and... YES!!! Ride height was absolutely perfect! I was in he=
aven!
At ~1300h i lifted the car, fastened all suspension bolts, put in the
freshly re-greased drive shafts in vice versa, re-connected the brake lin=
es
and then we re-connected the handbrake cables (biggest PITA) - you can't
have hands enough to to this - if they only would fit between the torsion=

tube and rear seat molding ;-).
Then after bleeding the brakes i left the garage at ~1600h and drove to
a tire shop to have my front and rear suspension aligned. They did a good=

job this time - no wonder - all the bolts were fresh and could easily be
adjusted.

My rear suspension consists now of the following parts:
- Weltmeister 29mm solid torsion bars
- adjustable yellow Koni S2 gas sport shocks (1035 Sport)
- 3-way adj. 19mm sway bar from the 968 M030 package

I set the rear Koni's to 4/5 stiffness; the rear sways to full stiff.
They car's ride is fantastic! It's *much* stiffer than w/ the stock
suspension but it's still very comfortable (although i use 17" Michelin
MXX3 Pilot SX 225/45 front and 255/40 in the rear!).

I chose the (more aggressive) suspension settings from Jim Pasha's articl=
e
in Excellence as a guideline. Front caster 3 degree; front camber -1 degr=
ee;
rear camber -1 degree 20 minutes.


The first test:
On sunday i had the chance to test my car on a track! We (PCA Germany
Region) organized a test&setup day on a rented airport's runway. You
can imagine that i was kind of nervous how my car would behave w/ the
new suspension. The car's handling is still very neutral - on the skid pa=
d
(w/ a rather uneven surface) neither the rear came loose not did the car
understeer too much. Even when i lifted off the gas pedal the car stayed
neutral! The car's behaviour is now much more predictable than w/ the
stock suspension due to the nearly eliminated body roll i think. You
just have to point and shoot. ;-))

The track we set up for an auto-x (many fast lane changes and fast
serpentines) were no problem for my car. I did some good times -
and had a good time, of course ;-)


Big thanks to:
- Doug Donsbach and Kevin Gross for their installation instructions.
  (Hope i missed none!)
- Nick Fuzessery and Doug Donsbach for giving me details about their
  suspension setups!
- Jason Burkett @ Paragon Products as main parts supplier. He made very g=
ood
  prices and delivered all parts in time to germany in excellent conditio=
n.
- Carlsen Motorcars for their good prices on sway bars.
- And last but not least to Jim Moder who assisted and helped me out when=
ever
  he could.
