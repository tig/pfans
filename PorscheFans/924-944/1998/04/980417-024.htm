Derek,Randall:

I noticed that everybody who has responded has done chips at the same
time...is it the chip or the MAF???

I can understand better throttle reponse and driveability, i just
can't see that the slight difference in intake restriction is going to
make any difference in HP when on boost. I am willing to wager(a small
amount) that a dyno check of a MAF with no chip would should no gain
in HP. Seems that you could spend half the money and get a lot more HP
by removing restrictions in the exhaust system. The HP gain would come
even without a chip...

 Also the tradional AF sensors do go bad.. are you guys comparing
"worn out" OE parts to a new MAF??

Hope i am not beating a dead horse... seemed  like it was worth more
discussion.

Peter,
There is no choice but to change chips when installing a MFS.  I tried
leaving
the old chips in when I installed mine(just to see how they would work)
and the
car would not even run.  New chips are part of the Autothority MFS kit.
You
are right about the exhaust system, I did that first with a Bursch Cat
By-pass.
You are not going to realize great power gains from the MFS when the
rest of
the system does not flow well also.  If I were starting out with a stock
944T the
MFS would be the last flow modification to make.  There is no doubt in
my mind
that the MFS works much better than the stock configuration on a highly
modified
car.  I'm not trying to sell MFS's and I don't care if anyone else ever
buys one for
their 944T.  You have 30 days free trial and if you don't like it you
can send it back.
I kept mine.
