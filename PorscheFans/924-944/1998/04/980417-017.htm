I've used bras on several different cars I've owned.... They do a great job
of keeping bug carcases off of the front of the car when driving on the
highway. Mainly they stayed in the trunk until I was going to drive a fair
distance on the highway and then I would install the bra. I found that you
need to get a good quality bra (not Wolf, but Colgan Customs are good). If
you drive the car in snow or rain, you don't need to remove it, there is
enough air flow to dry the padding very quickly. If the bra is wet and the
car is going to sit, you need to remove it or the combo of wet bra and sun
can ruin the paint. A good quality bra doesn't not move around on the car
and therefore rubbing is a non-factor. I never had a problem with the bra
damaging the paint. It is nice to get where you're going, remove the bra,
clean the windshield and then car looks pretty good.

I personally don't understand people who put bras on their cars, ruin the
bra by hitting curbs, then leave it on flapping in the breeze, etc. Does a
ripped up bra make the car look better? I'd hate to see what's under it.
