Don't let this list scare you too much. I am sure there are a lot of people
on the list with similar experiences to me.  Remember, anytime anyone of
the 150-2000 members (depending on what the server says that day) has a
problem, it is posted.  The other 140-1990 people without a problem say
nothing.  I have driven Porsches for my entire driving life (15 years) and
have spent less than $2,500 on repairs, totall.  Now that said, I have
spent about that or more on preventative maintenance and do non-major
repairs myself.  I have only been stranded once, and that was when the
coolant thermostat gave out on a 100 + degree day on highway 5 in central
california.  It was a $10 aftermarket part that everycar on the market has
(except 911's, etc), so that is not Porsche's fault.  As far as REAL
sportscar go, they are the only daily drivable choice.  Don't assume your
luck will be as good as mine, but most well cared for Porsches will last
with few problems.

If you decide to buy a Porsche, you will like it for the first month or
two, then you will begin to feel the car, fall in love with it, and never
be happy with anything else.  I tried an MR2 at one point.  The first month
of the car was great, the engine happily reved to 7500RPM's, shifted
easily, etc.  But as I started to get to know the car and push it a bit,
the car failed miserably.  I hated it and sold it as soon as I found a nice
944.

If you are really concerned with reliability, you may want to stay away
from the turbo.  The 3 liter 944S2 is just as fast unless you plan on
modifying the car and is much more reliable.  Another possibility is give
up some HP and get a standard 944.  Really nice examples can be had for
around $5k and will initiate you into the world of Porsche with greater
reliability and lower maintenance.

Hope this helps.
