Eeek panic.

Imagine my concern to hear that I had filled my brake system with
silicon fluid by accident!

I have investigated further and must apologise to the list for duff
information.
In my reply to a query concerning the use of DOT3 and DOT4 brake fluid I

inadvertently stated that I had used DOT5 fluid without any problem. I
should have
looked at the bottle properly as is actually says DOT5.1
In my ignorance I assumed that DOT5 was DOT5 but this is not so.
It appears that DOT5 is silicon based and shouldn't, but could be, a
problem.
DOT5.1 is a high temperature glycol based product which is fully
compatible
with DOT3 and 4, which is why I used it.
What moron chose to use DOT5 and DOT5.1 to refer to incompatible
products
can only be guessed at.

Anyway, sorry again but by compensation I have found a good site for the
explanation of the
various merits which I recommend at.
