Sorry Donovan,

I did check the source out a month ago, and they claim to have no repair
information on Porsche cars of any kind.  If you get to the order
section it states they do not have information on the followings models,
and Porsche is one listed there.  I even sent e-mail to confirm this,
and they restated it in e-mail.

So Keep looking!

Thanks,
Gary

To: 924-944@PorscheFans.com

As there has been a lot of talk about getting the Shop Manuals on CD
Rom, I thought I would let you all know I found a potential source for
some, if not all of the information in the manuals.  Check out
www.alldata.com/consumer/TSB/yr.html.  From there, you just enter the
year, make and model of the car you are looking for info on, and it
will list the avilable publications.  This company claims to have
available all the 944 Technical Service Bulletins, and on the on-line
listing of bulletins (for my 1983, which I looked up) is included, as
items #12, "Workshop Repair Manuals". This would appear to indicate
that this company, which specializes in providing repair information
to independent shops, has available the entire set of manuals for the
944 with TSBs and supplements in CD Rom form.

Since I have the harcopy manuals, and am not really interested in
having a CD Rom of them, I didn't contact the company to confirm the
content of their CD, or what the price was.  Just thought some of you
out there who were looking for such a thing might want to give these
guys a try.  Best of luck.
