     If your engagement point changes as the clutch wears on a 944 type 
     car, something is wrong.  The actuation is hydraulic, similar to your 
     brake system.  The slave cylinder piston starting position will move 
     as the clutch wears to compensate.  Only the master cylinder and it's 
     geometry determines the engagement point.  The new clutch i installed 
     feels as light as my gas pedal usually in the morning and gets 
     slightly stiffer as it warms.  I believe this is normal.  As far as 
     stiff clutch pedals as a problem, i think the wear on the release fork 
     tongs from the throwout bearing race causes 'cocking' of the throwout 
     bearing on the guide sleeve.  This dragging of the throwout bearing 
     may be what give that stiff clutch pedal.  I had this problem so i 
     machined the tongs on the release fork flat and installed with the new 
     cluch kit and it seems to be as light as a feather.  This is my theory 
     anyway...

     Hello P-Fans
             A new clutch will have a "light" feel or effort compared to an 
     old worn
     clutch. That is if the clutch job was done right in replacing: the 
     needle
     bearings in the release fork, release/through out bearing, pilot 
     bearing,
     ect... When I replace my clutch the feel had a Toyota type feel. this 
     shortly
     will return to a heavy and heavyer type feel as the clutch wears. Also 
     the
     engagement position will move. When the clutch is new the clutch will 
     enage
     towards the floor, as it wears it will slowy engage higher and higher. 
     When I
     replaced my clutch, the engagement position was almost in the last 
     inch of the
     clutch pedal release. When the clutch was new it would almost engage 
     on the
     floor.
             So I mainly think the different feel is from new greased 
     bearings and not the
     pressure plate type.
     
     Good Luck

     Someone mentioned that their new Cup clutch is easier to push than the 
     old
     stock clutch.  I thought one sign of an aging clutch (the whole thing, 
     not
     just the friction plate) was increased effort required to push the 
     clutch
     pedal.  Is that not right?
