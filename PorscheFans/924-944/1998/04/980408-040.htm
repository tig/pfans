Bill and P-Fans --

I seem to recall some "rule-of-thumb" about minimum required oil pressures,
but can't recall how it went. Something like bar/rpm?  Anyone heard this
one? My S2 oil pressure drops below 4 bar during a very hot day on the
track using 15-50 Mobil 1.  Really scared me the first time it happened.
