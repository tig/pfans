Jonathan:

I got everything from David Reins at Powerhaus.  As Randall Morton
from PFans can attest, "you call Powerhaus and you speak to the owner,
you call Windward and you speak to a computer".  Windward does have an
excellent reputation for modifying 951s (especially the stroker kits),
but I personally prefer Powerhaus as my roommate/mechanic has used
them exclusively for modifying his 930s and 951 as well as all his
customers' cars and hasn't had a comlpaint yet!

In terms of chips, one of my friends tried the Superchips in his 1986
951 and it made a noticeable "seat of the pants" increase in power
over the previously installed Stage 2 Autothority chips (there was a
recent posting regarding this firm).  However, both Autothority and
Weltmeister are "established" companies with many years of proven dyno
testing and a strong following.

Good luck!!
