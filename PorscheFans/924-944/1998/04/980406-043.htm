Howdy

I had my glass come loose from the frame on a 86 951.
I removed an rebonded it, NO GO, tried again NOPE.
Also tried to use some tension cables-nope.

I finally just bought another hatch from 
AAA small car world in Ft. Worth (Cowtown) Texas
for US$180. Included wiper, rubber wing and tinting.

Changed it out in front of there shop in about and hour.

Subject: 944S2 HATCHBACK GLASS

Please Help !
I have a1989 944S2. The problem is that the rear hatchback glass appears 
to
be de-bonding from the frame, around the area of the support hinges at 
the
roof line. As the whole thing is fairly flexible I have always attempted 
to
keep the hinges free by lubrication with oil from time to time, amd 
always
shut the hatchback lid squarely. The increasing de-bonding can be seen
around the hinge area as the black bonded edge of the glass breaks away
from the internal bonding and leaves a clear glass area on the de-bonded
glass. This area is increasing as the bonding is breaking away from the
frame.
Can anyone help me with a fix, I assume the head lining must be removed 
to
get the hatchback, but how do I repair the hatch back and end up with 
the
plain black area around the edge of the glass. I am concerned that if it 
is
left, eventually the glass may break because of the unequal stressing it
may receive. Please note I am in the UK not stateside.

Regards
