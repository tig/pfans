For an S2, you need both cams from the S. Than you get the
40 gain. By using only 1 cam, you only got 20 HP. Did you 
check to see if the 20 hp was intake or exhaust HP? Exhaust
HP is more important because it helps push you down the
road faster. Too much intake hp can actually slow you down
because the car sucks so much air that it creates a low 
pressure area in front of the air box. This results in too
little oxygen reaching the motor. The O2 sensor reads that
and then leans the mixture. This can create a feedback loop
that eventually causes the engine to implode! It can be very
dangerous. That's why you always need to take a balanced
approach to performance upgrades.
