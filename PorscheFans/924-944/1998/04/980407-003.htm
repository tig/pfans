Young, I've heard about the 'limp home' mode before. Is it for real -
meaning does the engine's DME unit set itself into a particular mode
that can be detected by the Bosch diagnostic tool? (This is the blink
code tool I think.) My service operation connected up this tool to the
DME brain and got nothing out of it - no fault code, no status code, not
even a 'good morning, how are you today?' (But a brain tester, Network
500 who use an ATP (not Bosch) program to test the brain gave it an all
clear.

Regarding the DME Relay I swopped it for a new unit as a test and, don't
guess, it made no difference.

Arghhhh!!!!!
