Derek:

Around the Boston area the MAF has been given the nickname "Cash Flow
Sensor" by some pretty good mechanics. I am not sure exactly what the
theoretical advantage of the MAF is ....Can you (or anybody else out there)
explain it?
I would think that throttle response might be improved... but i just don't
understand how it can deliver more HP. Are you sure you are just
experienceing the "S" turbo impact?
