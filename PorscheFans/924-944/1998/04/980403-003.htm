Ok all, I said I would keep you informed, so I shall. 
The ol' 944 looks absolutely killer with the tint job.
All of the tint is Sun Guard brand which I think is
made by 3M.  I have 20% tint on all the side windows
and hatch lid, and a 50% tint on the windsheild (this
is the darkest tint allowed on a windsheild in Indiana)
Honestly: I cant even tell there is tint on the windsheild
its so light, anyway the windows and hatch look really 
cool!  As for how long it took.  The shop spent 4 hours
on the windows and windsheild and 5 hours on the hatch.
All worth it!!

Interesting note: After they had finished they told me:
"thats the last Porsche we do at the normal 2-door
price, that hatch is an absolute bit@h!!"  So ask
when you go in if the shop has ever tinted a Porsche 
before and you might luck-out,  just make sure they
have a lifetime Guarentee! (mine does, Nation wide)
If anyone Is contemplating having this done I give it
a huge thumbs-up.
laters,
-Nick Miller
