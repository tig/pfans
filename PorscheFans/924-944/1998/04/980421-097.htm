Hi guys,,yikes this friggin car is driving me bananas. wiring shorted
out and gutted interior. My `baby` was running great when fire occured.
I been cleaning it out as time and weather permits. Just 1 short
question---would any of you guys attempt to re-store this if it was
yours? I hate to just `junk` it out. Sometimes I wonder if its worth the
time, effort, cost. I`ve have also considered converting it to a `racer`
but I`m really not into that, even tho I enjoy racing as a spectator.
The re-wiring part is the most challenging aspect. I just keep plugging
away at it tho. Opinions please.
