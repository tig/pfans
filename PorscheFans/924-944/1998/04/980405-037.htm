Tim,
I am the third owner of my '86 951.  I have ALL records from day 1.  The
first owner complained of the same "rattling from the rear end".  It was
always checked, but on subsequent scheduled maintenance visits, the
"rattling" was always mentioned to the servicer (a Porsche dealer).
Long story short, I still have the infamous "rattle" at almost exactly
the RPM range you mentioned.  It does sound like it's coming from the
rear.

I am taking the car in tomorrow to have belts tensioned and CV's worked
on.  I'll mention the rattle again and let you know what they find, but
your post will give me a possible place to have them check.  HOWEVER, I
am not so sure I want anyone messing with the wastegate right now...the
car really seems to be performing well.  Turbo lag seems minimal- it
seems to spool up very quickly (love that sound), and boost comes on
strong and fast, in a consistent manner.  Unless someone convinces me I
am losing performance with this little annoyance, I don't think I will
attempt to have it fixed.

Please let me know if you find out differently.
