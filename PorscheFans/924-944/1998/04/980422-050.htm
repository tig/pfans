Hello P-Fans
	
	The VW battery cover you are looking for was OEM/standard on '94-'95
Golf/Jetta 4 cylinder models. I believe it was deleted onwards... This battery
cover was used - I believe to extend the battries life span (probably just
past the warranty period!) and to keep the battery acid intact in the event of
a collision accident. Note: that VW had two size covers one for the VR6 models
(OEM which was a smaller version battery) and one for replacement batteries
(4cylinder size, same as 944's) - group 41 (this is the cover you want). In
the VW VR6 cars the engine compartment runs very hot so it is prone to
evaporate the batteries fluid - fast. This is also why VW used the cover. In
fact i use a AutoBahn sealed battery in my 951!  I personally do not like the
covers because while they do help shield the battery from any heat/water
exposure, it also keeps any Hydrogen/Acid fumes inside of the cover - this HAS
been known to cause a small explosion on certain occasions!! The cover only
shields the battery along the sides and at the top - not the bottom of the
battery! So acid will still seep onto the bulkhead area and do damage!! If you
are simply looking to protect the battery terminals from dirt/moister - try
ordering the plastic battery tray cover that came on top of '85-87 GTi 8V's
this will prevent water from laying ontop of the battery and cuasing damage!
It fits the group 41 series batteries.
 
Good Luck
David
