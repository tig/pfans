People -

        My 88 924S seems to be misbehaving a little. Below about 4000RPM 
the engine just doesn't seem as stable or responsive as it should be - 
passing 4000RPM everything seems much smoother (the engine sound changes 
quite a lot). Idle is fairly but not completely stable at the requisite 
850RPM. No stalls but the idle "hunts" somewhat.  I appreciate that around 
the 4000RPM point is where the power really cuts in but I'm not convinced 
that all is well. Any and all ideas welcomed.

        Secondly, I have some time on my hands at the moment ("resting" 
between contracts!). As the car is now ten years old do the panel think 
that a careful checkout of the DME relay, DME box, and air flow meter 
would be good preventative maintenance? And if so, could some kind soul 
post the procedures for this, especially how to clean the track in the 
AFM (and get it back together successfully)? I'm no mechanic but I'm happy 
enough with electrical and electronic work, so this seems to be a sensible 
enough area for me to work in. Recommendations for other light PM tasks 
would be welcome, too.

        Finally, when I bought my car the rear defogger didn't work. When 
I looked at the short, heavy wires going from the grid itself to the 
contacts on the struts, the connectors were *very* loose. The previous 
owner had replaced the fuse with a 25A one. I replaced the wires with new 
ones, cleaned the fuse & relay contacts and viola! - it works perfectly 
with a 16A fuse as per spec. I know the corroded fuse contacts have been 
mentioned before but I thought that I'd mention the connections in the 
hatch itself - they get a lot of vibration and moisture there. Hope this 
helps someone (in fact this problem seems common enough to go in the FAQ).

        Thanks to all for your help, and for the group itself. It's _must_ 
reading here.     

        Cheers!
