When the pan was pulled there was a baffle inside it.  Now, I thought =

that there were no baffles until the later 1987 model cars or was it that=
 =

in later 1987 the baffle was changed to allow for less oil migration away=
 =

from the oil pick-up?

Also, I have heard some of the rumors about additional drilling of the =

crank to help prevent this from happening in the future.  Anyone tried or=
 =

have information about this?
<

Mike,

The baffle was up dated in '87, you can find the part # in the FAQs.  If
you give the Prince of Parts, Geo. B., a call he may have one.  You can
take epoxy putty and seal around the edges of the baffle against the pan.=
 =

This keeps more oil in the bottom of the pan.  If you want all the detail=
s,
email me.

When I started building my $troker, I researched the #2 rod bearing probl=
em
to the ends of the earth.  Crossdrilling #2 is not the answer.  For the
crossdrillers out there ;-), give me the theory of why crossdrilling will=

work otherwise keep your flames to yourselves.  What helps is an Accusump=
,
champhering the leading edge of the rod journal oil holes, cutting the
edges of the rod bearings, shimming the oil pressure relief spring, and
probably most important, keeping your oil level at about 1/8" above full =
on
the dipstick.  I have heard about opening up one of the oil return holes =
in
the head but do not have anything definate on that.  Bottom line, an
updated baffle and full oil should keep your engine happy.  If you want a=
ny
details on any of these upgrades, email me.
