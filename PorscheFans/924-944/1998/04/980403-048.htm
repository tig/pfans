You need to get a set of snap ring pliers with 45 degree tips. Sears has a
set with replacable tips if you're in a hurry and don't want the good ones.
With the cheap replacable tips you can file a little cut into the end of the
tip to better catch the edge of the ring.

If the ring is positioned so that the holes are at the top of the housing
you are best off doing the deed from under the car. If the holes are toward
the bottom of the housing do it from the top. Toward the side is probably
best done from below also.

I get lots of light under there and hold the tool in one hand and a mirror
in the other to position the tips in the holes. After that is done it is
simple.

Whatever you do sit down, relax and have a beer or two or three before your
frustration drives you to grab a hammer and beat it out :)

Good luck,

Doug
