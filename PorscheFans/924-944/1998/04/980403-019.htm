if you live in san diego and are not the most mechanically inclined,i
would reccomend the dealer for service on any porsche.ive taken my last
two porsches there.the service has been excellent and when it comes to
warrantys you cant beat it.for years i was getting ripped off by the
local independant shops.on my 944s i had my tranny rebuilt twice the
head gasket done twice,the lifters done twice,timingbelts and hoses done
twice besides a whole lot of other stuff in only 40000 miles.my tranny
was broke two weeks after VOLKERS GERMAN did it.he siad it was my fault
and would not cover it under warranty.he also set the cams in my 944S in
the wrong place and said it was my fault!lol!i threatened to sue and he
finally replaced my money after i has sunk 10k worth of repairs in a
year or so.so i was up to the task of finding another shop to work on my
baby.i searched high and low in san diego.tried three highly reputable
shops, BLACK FORREST,DIETERSand PERFECTION PORSCHE.all three of these
shops are SCAMS.i finaaly went to the dreaded dealer!to my surprise this
was the shop i was looking for.HONEST,COURTEOUS and TIMELY and on top of
it all a two year unlimited mileage,no questions asked warrnty!!!!!!!let
me tell you i put the warranty to the test.it is a little more then the
independants but these guys that work here get paid hourly no matter
what they fix on your car.it is not like an independant shop where the
guy behind the desk is counting on you spending a fortune to get his
raise!!!lol!since this experience i learned a lot about my porsche.i
soley take it to the dealere now.i just bought an 86 951 that i recently
took to the shop,it had a couple of things that i wanted to do.so i took
it in and to my surprise the dealer insisted i let him exaimine my
timing belt.i said sure an extra 62 bucks isnt going to kill me,so i let
him.luckily i did and found out that my belt needed to be adjusted. it
had been 6000 miles since the guy i bought it from put the timing belt
on and he never retensioned it!this extra 62 bucks could have saved me
4000 in the future and it was thanks to the dealer!!!!!the dealer i use
is pioneer centres in mira mar.if you go there ask for a vintage card
for $69.you get two free oil changes with it and 15%off of parts and
labor.normal cost is $72 with the card it bringsit to $64 which is a
little more then the $50 an hour you pay at the independants shop but to
me well worth it.i just thought i should share this with fellow porsche
fans who do not like to get ripped off!!!!!i hope this can save just one
person any grief when it comes to fixing his porsche!!!
