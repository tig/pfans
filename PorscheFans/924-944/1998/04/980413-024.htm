Hi all, just looking for someone who will put my fears to rest....

Lately my 85.5's clutch began to chatter (or that's what I'd call it) under
heavy stop-n-go traffic conditions.  It's been getting progessively worse
(as in, it takes less use before it starts acting up than it used to). 
Giving extra gas and feathering the clutch more is my fix, but I don't like
it one bit.

Also, peculiar thing happened to me Friday in San Diego....  after a long
hot drive I parked the car for half an hour in first gear (with parking
brake on, but after I let off the foot brake).  Went to back out of my
space, couldn't get the car out of first.  REALLY had to pull to make it
happen.  I didn't like that one bit either.  Afterwords all the gears,
including first, were smooth.  Same thing happened again yesterday, same
conditions.  Was that jsut because I was letting the car roll to a rest in
gear, then putting on the brake, or are there deeper, more expensive forces
at work here?

The previous owner had the clutch replaced 1/7/97 with the same style (ie,
rubber-centered).  Only 11,000 miles been logged since that repair, seems a
little too soon for problems.  His driving style was very easy on the
clutch, and I've only had the car since this Feb.

85.5 944 (which seems a little jumpy in LA traffic)
