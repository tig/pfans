Ryan, 

What I always tell my friends is this...This is a 10+ year old car. 
Yes, they are EXTREMELY well engineered (even if you here us rant and
race once in a while), but at that age things like oil seals and cv
joints boots start to dry and crack (Porsche uses rubber like everyone
else, and rubber is rubber no matter what car it is in).  These
maintenance issues will come up in a car of this age...nothing you can
do to stop it.  

Good advice is to put away $200 a month for maintenance.  It may go a
year and need nothing at all, then need $1500 for a new clutch.  A lot
of us spend the money we do on our porsche's because we love the brand
and want our cars to remain PERFECT.  (that ten drops of oil per night
from my oil pan gasket just isn't going to do) Make sure if you buy one
it is from someone like that, not a broke redneck who you know can't
spend a dime to keep his car maintained.  I think that $200 a month is a
pretty good guess( what do you think Porschefans?), less if you do your
own maintenance.  It sounds like you don't, so get the car inspected by
a PORSCHE certified mechanic, not just a mechanic....  If you buy a
poorly maintained example, that $200 a month is certainly not accurate. 
Just be careful and picky picky picky about which one you put your name
on.

Well, that depends...a Porsche is not for everyone...but they can be
everything to someone.  Personally, I can't imagine EVER buying anything
else.
