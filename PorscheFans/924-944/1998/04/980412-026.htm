Ok my fellow Porsche Owners,

	I am hoping that you can help me out, about 3 weeks ago my 89 944S2 over 
heated and I took it in to the shop, after a couple days they told me it 
was a part that helped keep coolant next to the fuel injectors to keep them 
cool or something to that effect(it seemed like a connection that was to 
the engine that starting springing leaks of coolant everywhere) and he told 
me they did a 27 pt inspection or 50 pt...whatever and that everything was 
fine, well after I got the car a couple days later I hear weird noises from 
the engine kinda like a gurgling, clanking noise and so I called and he 
said bring it in and he'll take a look. (Car running fin) well didn't have 
a chance to do that and I took it out last night and after hearing that 
same noise but for a bit longer, it over heated again but this time it is 
not leaking from the last place but now from the somewhere else. And I 
heard a bunch of gurgling noises.
	My question is and I know its tough since you guys probably didn't 
understand a word I typed, HAHA, after spending close to  $600 the first 
time, should he have caught the reason why the car overheated the second 
time since it doesn't seem to be from the same source.
	I would appreciate any type of response.

			Thanks,
Bill H
89 944S2 (DEAD)
