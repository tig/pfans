Hello, i just subscribed to the list after spending many months to no avail
trying to locate info.  I have been scanning through the list archives and
have noticed that i have come to the right place.

I am a first time Porsche owner and last fall found a price i could afford
on a car though many have told me since i was beaten and paid far too much.
 I purchased a 78 924, body good-except front air dam, needs a little work
on the interrior for $1600.  What i have been searching for is aftermarket
parts, used parts, engine swap info, body kits and interrior items; carpet
kit, dash.

I was told there are catalogs out there but have yet to find one.  Have
tried calling Porsche dealers but of course, no answers, except stock
replacement items.  Was told there is a 944 body kit for the 924 by some
guy in Texas but, he dosen't remember where he got it.  Will a 924S engine
and trans fit into my 78 924 without a major amount of engineering, plus is
it worth the trouble.  We're talking a bit of a budget here, so any info
will help immensely.

Thanks,
