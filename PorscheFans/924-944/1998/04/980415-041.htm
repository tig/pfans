Mike,

I recently ordered the Autothority short shift kit from GPR ($139) and
am returning it.  The new linkage consists of a rod that is attached to
an aluminum arm by a heim joint.  The aluminum arm has two different
mounting holes for that joint -- one results in a 45% reduction in throw
length, the other a 25% reduction.  The part is shipped with the arm and
rod connected in *parallel* and the heim joint mounted for a 45%
reduction.  While attempting the install I discovered that the new
linkage won't fit unless the arm and rod are *perpendicular* to one
another.  I was a little confused/annoyed since (1) the part arrived
assembled with the parallel orientation and (2) it appeared that you
couldn't stick with the 45% reduction option and reorient everything
properly unless you ground away part of either the joint's base, or the
arm itself.  (NOTE: because of the location of the 25% reduction
mounting hole, that option doesn't require any grinding).

I called Autothority to find out what I was missing here (the
instructions didn't mention any grinding, or that the shipped part was
assembled incorrectly).  The third person I spoke with there, very
nicely explained that my above observations were correct and that they
were aware of the problem.  He went on to say that they have called the
manufacturer several times about this and have also received many calls
from confused customers like me.  

Recently, I have heard very mixed feedback from people who are using the
kit in their cars.  Some love it, others hate it.  My guess is that
car-to-car variations in the linkage and transaxle may have something to
do with these disparate opinions.  Given all this, I have chosen to
leave my linkage the way God & Ferry Porsche intended -- stock.

BTW GPR has been great throughout this fiasco and has made my
satisfaction their number one priority.  I have no problem recommending
them to anyone.  The shift kit, however....
