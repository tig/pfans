You can do this yourself, however, you must measure the travel distance
or decrease in height as you lower the car...remember we wan't both
sides
equal!

There are two (2) eccentric bolts in the rear; one for height and one
for camber
the larger of the two (on the trailing blade) w/adjust the height.  The 
trailing blade is located right behind the rear tire and to its front. 
There
will be two bolts...loosen both SLIGHTLY...and turn the eccentric bolt 
(closest to the tire) to adjust the height.  Make sure to measure height
from
some "fixed" point ie: bottom of strut to set both sides at equal
position.
