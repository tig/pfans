Hi all,  I've recently come back from vacation and have begun to install the
engine in the car ('89 951).  This is perhaps the hardest part of this whole
rebuilding process.  Getting the drive shaft into the clutch housing hole was a
huge ordeal in it self.

The other hard part is getting the wiring harness sealing grommet to fit
properly into the fire-wall...

I've got the cooling system and exhaust system to install, then I can finally
turn the engine over...

I've hit one problem though.  The clutch pedal goes up and down without too
much resistance (except for some spring action).  The pedal doesn't do
anything.  When I installed the slave cylinder, I had to open the bleeder screw
to push the piston into the cylinder so I could install it.  (instead of
checking the clutch pedal to see if it was down).  This seemed to have a
detrimental effect on the operation of the pedal, which equals no operation at
all.

Have I ruined the slave or master cylinder in some way?  Or do I just need to
bleed every thing (which I tried for a little while, but didn't seem to affect
any thing).

I haven't raised the back end of the car yet, but probably will try that
tonight...

I'm using a vacuum bleeder (mity-vac) to bleed the clutch.

Thanks!

chris
