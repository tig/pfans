Whatever's on sale or whatever's available used. For 92% street, I'd go
with the regular "special" (red) Koni's as the best shock. Jason at Paragon
has them on special sometimes. Even at full soft the sport (yellow) shock
is, well, on the harsh side for street use. Boge's are fine, and I don't
know anything about the KYB's. 

If you're on a budget, there are a number of perfectly good used OE
struts/shocks around, as people succomb to performanceimprovementitis. Look
for turbo units. I think that those would be the best buy. Ditto goes for
factory anti-sway bars.

Congratulations on having a 340,000 mile 944. With that many miles, be sure
to inspect your suspension bushings.
