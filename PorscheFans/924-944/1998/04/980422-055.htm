>Woops.   Friction is a contributor, but it isn't the main force holding
the assembly together.   If you do vector analysis (I don't EVEN want to
go there!), the angle of the thread (pitch) will determine the force
vectors.   Simple physics that if the linear force parallel with the
bolt is greater than the force perpendicular (math will calculate those
values), the nut will not turn.<
Sorry but I have to disagree with this. The combination of the friction
between the threads and the friction between the bottom of the nut and
the tensioned surface keep the nut from moving. Because of the pitch of
the threads on the fastener, if there was no friction present, ANY force
applied opposite to the downward force of the nut would cause it to unwind.
