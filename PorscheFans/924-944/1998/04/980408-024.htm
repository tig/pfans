Brian,

At least your are not 17 and this is your first car.  I gotta ask, though:
"How is your driving record?"  Being 21 AND having a 944 turbo usually
means huge insurance costs, so you will need to factor this into your
overall yearly maintenance plan.  Insurance on the 951 has to be one of the
main reasons why this car is still out of reach for many would-be owners.
I was 23 when I got mine and let's just say that it was a challenge making
the insurance payments.  Thankfully, I received zero tickets (other than
for parking) for my efforts since buying the car.  Now that I'm 30, my
rates have gone way down to a more respectable level and I can finally
relax a bit and avoid paying those hefty premiums.  I should also say that
there are specialty insurance brokers who can get you a better deal, but
read the fine print.  I went with a major company and I needed to have the
car towed on a flat-bed at least three times in the last six years, so
sometimes it does pay to get really complete coverage.

Good luck,

Chris
