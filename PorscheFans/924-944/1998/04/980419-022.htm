I would like for anyone who knows to send me the German engineering
genius' name that designed the oil pan/gasket idea.  

So Mr. Engineer sir, how the hell do you hold the gasket in place while
lifting the pan up?  No, I don't have the engine or car upside down so
that I can just lay the gasket on the engine....  Oh, so you never
thought of what it might be like trying to align those two while the car
is assembled?  Never thought to put a couple alignment pins on the pan? 
Well aren't you just the dumbest bas***d in the Fatherland?  How about I
track down all your descendants and slaughter them, thereby not allowing
your obviously defective DNA to further pollute the master race?  Or,
better yet, you climb your silly blond haired butt under my beautiful
car and try to get that damn thing assembled yourself...You lost the war
because your timing belts all broke, the motor mounts all failed, the
caim chain tensioners ripped the heads in half, and the oil pan gaskets
were impossible to put back in...  

Alright...I'll go back out and try again.

Anyone have any helpful hints for a guy obviously in the latter stages
of completely losing it?  By the time I come back in to the computer,
not having gotten the oil pan back on...I'll be a complete basket case.
