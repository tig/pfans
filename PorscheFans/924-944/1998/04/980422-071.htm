First of all, I would like to thank the individuals who responded to my
inquiry.

The source I chose was Jason @Paragon Products (800-200-936) who use OEM
(Zimmerman) rotors and slot them.  At the cost of $109 each and w/ free
shipping for orders over $150, it seems pretty good, especially compared
to other sources quoting over $300 for the rear set.  As a reference, the
plain rotors themselves per PPE cost $100 each at the dealer. 

The rotors have not been installed yet, so I cannot comment on braking
differences. Of course, these are the rear brakes and I have not updated
the proportioning valve, so I do not expect too many differences in
overall braking performance.

What I did notice is that the noises from the rear brakes have diminished
greatly ever since I have quit using the parking brake when parking the
car.  I wonder if the force from the drum brakes inside the hub is enough
to cause some minute warping of the rotors.  I have reverted to the
approach I was using w/ my 944S, which is using wheel chocks instead of
the parking brake.

Furthermore, the very scientific procedure of letting my car sit for a
week has diminished the belt whine.  I can hear the turbo again!
