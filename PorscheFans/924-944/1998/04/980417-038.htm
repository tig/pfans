Hey everybody -

Now for the technical questions regarding my new parts.  Before installing
the new rims (16x7 in front), my car drove straight as an arrow.  Last night
when testing them out, the car seemed to pull a bit to the left (even though
the tire pressure was equal, or so it was when I checked it).  Then as I was
accelerating really hard (to test the chip),  I suddenly smelled a very
strong burning odor, either electrical in nature or like a parking brake was
held up.  I'm sure the parking brake wasn't on when I was driving.   

I stopped the car immediately to look for any sign of trouble, but there was
none.  When I got back in and drove cautiously, the smell disappeared and
the car slowly seemed to return to steering straight ahead.

Could I have had a brake pad get held up suddenly and then release itself?
This experience has never happened before.  Or could it have been a
consequence of the new performance chip I just installed?  I'm positive I
installed the chip the correct way.

Thanks in advance,

Joseph Mitro
