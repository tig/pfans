The suspension pick up points for both sides of the rear not where they were
supposed to be.  I don't know the history of the car.  I took the car to a
highly regarded frame/alignment shop.  They measured everything on a frame
rack.

Bottom line, none of the suspension components were bent.

The alignment shop pulled the suspension points "in" to where they were
supposed to be.  Re aligned the front and rear to factory specs, and the car
handles fine now.  I have to get the car to a different alignment shop to
verify the settings (been burned too many times :-)

Before when you measured the toe in front of the rear tires and the rear of
the rear tires and subtracted the difference, you got almost 2".  Yes 2",
not 2 degrees!  I'm not joking.  No wonder the car was a handful.  Just goes
to show, buyer beware!

Now the car tracks straight and is stable.

I noticed that the car was missing the belly pan and some bolts holding
various plastic pieces in front of the car. Anyone got one for sale?

Thanks again for all the responses guys!
