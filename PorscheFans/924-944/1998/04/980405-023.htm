Hello fellow enthusiasts,

I am new to this list, but I'm looking at a 86 944 and have a couple of
questions to the list.

While test driving the car I noticed grinding in the transmission at the
shifter when changing from 1st to 2nd and 3rd to 4th, especially when it was
done quickly.  It looks like the synchronizers could not keep up with the
gears.  Is this a common problem?  Serious, or just an annoyance?

My other question is regarding the driver's door, which closes with a loud
bang as though there is no rubber bumper or any weather stripping (of course
it does have weather stripping).  I'm trying to determine if the car has
been in an accident.  It has been repainted.  So is this also a
characteristic of the car?

TIA

Lino
