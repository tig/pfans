On the subject of phosphate free anti freeze, I found this on Prestone's
FAQ list.  Perhaps this is why the various brands that do contain
phosphates still claim to be safe for aluminum.


"Q: Does Prestone antifreeze/coolant contain phosphates?
A: Some European automobile manufacturers request that a phosphate-free
antifreeze be used in their vehicles. This issue is related to the
extremely high mineral content of the water in Europe. If you were to mix
an antifreeze that contained phosphates with the type of water they have in
Europe, it may produce deposits that can settle in the cooling system and
promote corrosion. 

However, in North America we do not have this type of water problem.
Typical North American coolants have contained phosphates (which is part of
the corrosion inhibitor package) for many years. Therefore, the question of
phosphates is a non-issue here in North America. Prestone®
antifreeze/coolant is completely safe for use in both foreign and domestic
vehicles. 

For those consumers who would feel more comfortable using a phosphate-free
antifreeze, our Prestone® Extended Life 5/150 is phosphate, silicate, and
borate free. This coolant uses a special chemistry and technology that
extends the life of the corrosion inhibitor package so that it lasts for
five years or 150,000 miles (whichever comes first), and is safe for all
cars and light trucks (old or new)."


Now I agree that this does seem to stretch the generalization of water
mineral content but it does suggest that the use of distilled water with
this type of coolant should be fine.  I have used the phosphate containing
stuff for about 140K miles (yes I do change it every 2 years) and have
never seen any evidence of problems (I still have the original heater
control valve!).  Perhaps the city water here in South FL is in fact low in
minerals.
