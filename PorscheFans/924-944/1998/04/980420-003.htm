Hi PFans,
	Last week, while on holiday from work, I managed to get to the Design
Museum in London (near Tower Bridge, on the South Bank), and went around
the 'Ferdinand Porsche Design Dinasty' Exhibition that is currently on
there, forming part of the 50th Anniverary celebrations.

Though there are only a small number of exhibits, if you are in , or can
get to, London during the summer, it's well worth a visit.  Included are
wind tunnel models, full size cars including the Beatle cabriolet
prototype, engines, models and cars from the Lohner-Porsche electric
vehicle, to the new 996 with the most significant models, (but no full
size, front engined water pumpers) the 944 2.5l, and 928 32V engines,
the former being sectioned.  There is also a fully sectioned Boxter,
built by the Porsche trainees.

The exhibition runs from early April to August.  Entrance fee is just
over a fiver.

On a completely different note, after returning home, the following day,
some idiot, not looking where he was going, pulled out in front of me.
I managed to miss him, but he T-boned me, all down my near side.  The
impact, although at only about 20mph, made a total mess of the near side
of my 944, in my estimates, at least a couple of grand's worth of
damage, with a new NSF wing, NS sill, NS door and other pannel repairs
required.  :-((((((
It's just a case of waiting for my insurance co. to sort it out. (Hope
they don't write it off.)

The impact made a bit of a mess of his Rover, but not half of the damage
it did to my 944 !  At least the cars is still drivable. :-)

What p%*&^ed me off even more was the fact that I had just spent over
=A3700 getting it through the MOT !   :-(((

Lets hope this will be settled quickly.

Regards to all,

Currently, a pretty P'd off
