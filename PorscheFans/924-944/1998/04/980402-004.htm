Hi Tony,

I had that problem.

There should be a gasket ring at the joint.  The problem is that to fit 
 it involves parting the joint which is not at all easy as much 
 dismantling of the exhaust is required.

The gasket is a ring made of some sort of soft metal compound and when 
 you tighten up the bolts on the triangular flanges the gasket 
 "squashes" to give a gas-tight seal.

As the gasket is soft I found that it could be cut, I used tin snips, 
 in one place and then carefully opened it up enough to get it around 
 the pipe thus avoiding the need to separate the pipe.  I did this 2 
 years ago and it has been fine ever since.  Even if the gasket breaks 
 in the bending process it will probably still work okay as the 
 material kind of welds together under pressure as the flange bolts are 
 re-tightened.  Cost of the gasket was approx 3 pounds from the dealer.

Regards.....John.
