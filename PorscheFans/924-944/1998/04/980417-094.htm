What ever happened to the thread on PorscheFan decals?  Did anyone ever
take a hand at designing one, was there a web site, or did it jsut fizzle
away?  If there's still interest, I can put some stuff together this
weekend, but graphics art is one of my shortcomings (along with auto repair
*sigh*).

And also, just want to say thanks to John Potter.  I mailed the list in
hopes of buying a used wheel center to replaced the one that came flying
off my wheel.  John sent me one days later that was in such great
condition, it made it painfully obvious how harsh brake dust has been on my
Fuchs.  Thanks again!  I honestly couldn't keep up with my Pcar if it
weren't for the great people here.
