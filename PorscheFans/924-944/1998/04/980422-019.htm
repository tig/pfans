Hello:

Could someone please help me out with this one. My car is an 89 944 
Turbo. Now, I am not sure if this is the shift linkage or not. But 
it's a bar about 6 inches long or so with one end connecting to the 
top side of the transmission and the other end connecting to the shift 
apparatus. I believe that my car has the short shifter kit . So I have 
2 hole's vertically to choose from instead of one. On each end are 17 
mm and are milled with ball bearing built in to provide a smooth 
pivoting capability to the rod. One screw cost me 26 bucks, I couldn't 
believe it!  Anyway, I was told that this is the shift linkage but was 
confused when I read one of the previous post describing the shift 
linkage to be located near the actual shifter. Although, my real 
problem is reinstalling this new piece. There might be 2.5 to 3 inches 
from the top of the transmission and the body. And I can't seem to get 
the bolt started on the transmission . Any hints or tips would be 
greatly appreciated.
Also, has anyone ever had one break in half before? I had recently had 
my horizontal play adjusted for longer throughs horizontally. The 
short shift kit allows for adjustment of both vertical and horizontal 
through lenghts.

TIA
