Well, the response to my previous note has been underwhelming to say the
least, so I decide to start taking things apart today anyway...

So far I have removed one door panel and I pulled the existing door =
handle
out of the door skin enough (while still attached) to see that the inside
(lock, etc) looks exactly the same as the 968 handles I wish to install. =
 So
far, so good.

Next I carefully undid the plastic water barrier on the rear part of the
door so I could see what things looked like inside.  Not having any =
repair
manuals, this is what I think needs to be done to get at the attachment =
for
the handle:

1.  Disconnect power door lock mechanism and move out of the way.
2.  Remove thin metal plate (water protector?) from behind power door =
lock
mechanism (already done).
3.  Remove rear window channel.

Once these items are done I should be able to reach in and work with the
handle attachment, or more specifically, actually see it!  Right now it =
is
completely hidden behind the window channel, which has a built-in shield =
in
this area..

At this point I'm not sure how the window channel is removed.  I can see =
one
screw at the bottom of the channel.  If I remove that, will the channel =
be
free, or is there another hidden attachment at the top?

This whole procedure is a lot of work just to change a freakin door =
handle.
However, I think the results will be well worth the effort as the 968
handles are (IMO) much nicer looking and will complement the aero mirrors
I'll also be installing.

Can anyone with a set of factory manuals verify the correct procedure?
Thanks.
