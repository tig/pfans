Seems we 968s all have a common fault with the starters going
bad at what I would call an early age(mine at 47K miles).  Any 968
owner out there who has not had a starter problem?  My problem
was with the pinion gear/overrun clutch assembly being so gummed
up that it could not move in and out into position on that long shaft
that the 968 starter has.  I believe this is the same starter the newer
911's use, at least by the Automotion catalog.

Hi P-fans,

I had to have the starter replaced on my 92 968 because it was sticking
after I "let go".
Replaced with a rebuilt one at around 32Kmiles, about 6 months ago.

Another problem that I now have is the gas smell, but it only hapens if
I fill the tank more than half full. I guess the fuel sloshes around and
seeps into the hair line fracture. So I only fill it 1/2 and I have no
problems. It sems to me that it is a design problem and that it is
happening to a larger number of owners. I wonder if we can do something
about it if a group of P-fans get together and ask for a solution from
Porsche.
