Okay, this is NOT an April Fool's joke.  I know a guy who just put new
Kinesis Supercup wheels on his '86 951.  They're 18" x 10" in the rear
and he just screwed up a brand new 285/33-series Yokohama tire (OUCH!
$$$$ and hard to find too!).  The right rear wheel & tire are fine, but
the left rear Yoko looks like someone has taken a cheese grater to its
sidewall.  If it's not obvious already, he's having rubbing problems
(but only on the left side).  He already rolled the fenders to about 45
degrees (from what i can tell by looking at it), but he thinks he can
roll them almost flush and then it shouldn't rub.  We looked at another
951 with fenders rolled this way and he was running 275's just fine.  I
told him that I don't think any more rolling will help, and that he
should probably resort to shaving the fenders now, since they'll be much
harder to shave once he screw them up even more by pushing the lip
closer against the body panels.

Is anyone running 285's or 10" wide wheels in the rear of a 951?  If
rolling won't help, where can he go to get this thing shaved, and do
they use a sawzall or something?

Any help would be appreciated (at least by this guy, I really don't give
a damn but I like his exhaust so i thought I'd help him out).

Thanks,
Ben
