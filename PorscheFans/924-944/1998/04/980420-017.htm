Hey porschefans,

i was cleaning out my shed and found my bumper, 
the one that i broke last year and just happens to
 matchand was painted with my 78 924.  i  broke 
the mounts that are / were
 welded to the inside of the bumper rendering the 
entire thing useless.  it looks to be some sort of aluminum 
composite, shatterered when it broke. can these be
 replaced and rewelded to the bumper???
i may have to do some fabrication here, but  im concerned 
about welding to the bumper, which method is best to suit
metal involved??
and also, never "rock" a p-car by the rear bumper, thats 
how she broke, when i had to push her back to jump start
a dead battery. :(

tia.
