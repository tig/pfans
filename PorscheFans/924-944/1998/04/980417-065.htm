I love your list and mostly agree with it; but, my cruise control works
just fine ('87 951). Most of the rest of the list has happened to me.

>10. Control arms/ball joints. Let's design a part to strike fear into
>anyone who tracks their car. Every Porsche ever made is a race car? Well,
>maybe...
>
>9. Rear hatch seal. If your interior isn't soaked from the battery non-box
>corroding, this seal will slowly break away from the glass and soak the
>carpet. Almost impossible to make a good-looking repair.
>
>8. Water pump. Set your belts a little on the tight side as a preventative
>measure and watch the water pump fail. Just how many times has this part
>been redesigned?
>
>7. Cruise control. Sometimes it works, sometimes, it doesn't. Sometimes it
>works even when it is turned off. Does *anyone* have one that works?
>
>6. Clutch. Let's save a few bucks by using a one-piece clutch cover that
>neccessitates multiple hours of labour to remove when the slave cylinder
>rusts and leaks onto the rubber centre and renders an otherwise fine clutch
>useless. Then, in the 968, let's put in a proper two-piece cover,
>simplifying clutch repair, but move the rubber to between two flywheels,
>necessitating multiple hours of labour when said flywheels fail.
>
>5. Dash/HVAC. First, a dash that cracks if it sees sun (pre-'85.5.) with a
>steering column at your kees. Then, a dash that doesn't crack at first
>light, but has a gazillion little dash lights that slowly get dimmer and
>dimmer with time, and no lights at all for many switches. Also, in pre-85.5
>cars, put in an air-conditioner that is close to useless anywhere in North
>America. In post 85.5 cars, put in a system that is so complicated its
>switches, servos, and doo-dads fry themselves.
>
>4. Electric sunroof. First, a design so complicated one actually has to
>read the owner's manual to figure out how to remove the sunroof. Then, a
>mechanism that strips gears, breaks switches, and is still not quite fully
>understood by anyone.
>
>3. Timing belts (8v)/ Chain tensioners (16v).First, a timing belt that
>self-destructs, sometimes in as few as 10,000 miles. Then, (16v), a wider
>belt w/automatic tensioner, but now chain tensioner guides that
>self-destruct at random, ripping the tensioner out of the head, destroying
>said head.
>
>2. #2 Rod bearing. See control arm, above. Responsible for more Accusump
>sales than ever imagined.
>
>1. Battery non-box. Yes, let's not put in a real battery tray and in
>post-85.5 cars locate the Motronic and supplementary alarm circuits
>*directly* underneath so they can get soaked when battery acid inevitably
>eats its way through the metal. A 914 legacy destined to affect *every* 944.
>
>(Motor mounts are not included because the current design actually works
>for longer than a couple years.)
