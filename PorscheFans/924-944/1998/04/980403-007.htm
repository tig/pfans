Hello Tony & P-fans

I will assume you have checked the tire pressure? Right? 

I think you need to put the rear end of the car up in the air and check=
=0Aeverthing for tightness; wheel bearings bushings, ect... On my =9186 9=
51 I=0Anoticed that the inner bushing for the rear trailing arms were loo=
se. The=0Atrailing arm attaches to the torsion tube at the outter part an=
d near the=0Acenter of the car. Where it attaches to the center, my bushi=
ngs were loose. I=0Athink I torqued these inner  bushings to something li=
ke 60 ft/lbs. ? Just use=0Acommon sense here. I would also check for a wo=
rn wheel bearing. The rear=0Abearings are pressed in (non-adjustable unli=
ke the fronts!). 

Also on the Turbo=92s the 30mm nut holding the wheel/brake assembly to th=
e stub=0Aaxle is known to back off with age!!! Especially when the car ha=
s been chip=92d=0Athe extra torque seems to =93walk=94 off the nut! For a=
nyone who tracks their=0ATurbo this is a must check! On the Turbos there =
was NO cotter pin or hole=0Adrilled for this 30 mm nut. Porsche also upda=
ted the torque of this nut to 500=0ANm (I think?) from around 300 Nm. I u=
sed a four foot pipe w/breaker bar and=0Atorqued the hell out of it. Some=
thing like 270 ft/lbs! The more I think about=0Ait start with checking th=
e torque at the 30mm nut and then go from there...

Good Luck
