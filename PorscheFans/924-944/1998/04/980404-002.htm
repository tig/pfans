Hello Mark
=09
Yes it is really THAT simple! I just replaced my left control arm on my =
=9186=0A951. It took me 2 hours taking my sweet time. Most of that time I=
 was trying=0Anot to take off the sway bar when I should have just remove=
d it! I paid $300=0A(for one new A-arm) at my local P-Dealer for the cont=
rol arm.  Of course the=0Aparts manager always gives me great deals!   Al=
so replace the rear bushing for=0Athe A-arm. Its the one with two bolts t=
hat attaches to the rear of the A-arm.=0AThe bushings cost $40 each. I to=
ok extra care to note the position of the=0Aeccentric bolt for the caster=
 adjustment, so I did not have the aligment=0Achecked. If you are real ca=
refull - it should be ok. My car doesn=92t seem to=0Apull and tracks stra=
ight. 

I would go with the factory alloy A-arm set up. After all it has lasted 1=
00K,=0Athe new one should last that long as well! On most Jap cars the ba=
ll joints=0Aare shot at 60K!!! 

Good Luck
David

Subject: 951 - Front Control Arms

I have been told by the local dealer that the creaking and moaning =3D
coming from the right front strut tower is partially (mostly) caused by =
=3D
a bad lower control arm.  In fact, they say both are shot.  I just =3D
rolled past 100K miles tonight and need some A-Arm advice.

I don't track the car but I drive it hard on the windy roads in the GA =
=3D
mountains whenever possible.  Should I go for the Zims rebuilt model, =3D
the amazingly affordable - not - fabcar parts, or the OE stuff new from =
=3D
the dealer.  I really don't want to re-eningeer something so adding ball =
=3D
joints via some modification to my existing arms is out of the question. =
=3D
 Also, this does not look like that tough a job.  Unlike many cars where =
=3D
the lower part of the spring is retained by the control arm there =3D
appears to be no pressure on the Porsche unit.  Is this correct?  Is it =
=3D
really as simple as unbolting the old one, installing the new one, and =
=3D
getting an alignment?

Thanks!
Mark
