Hello tech people.
I was under the 944 preparing for a trans swap and I have a problem. I have
an 86 na with enough gear lash to bother me...so I purchased a good used
trans from a fellow list member to swap out. The trans axle was supposed to
originate from a 924S so I figured it should be OK. Either I didn't get what
I was supposed to or I got screwed. There connection for the speedometer is
not there. I understand that the earlier 924 had a different speedometer
pick up. Does the 924S use the 944 or the 924 style speedometer pick up?
There is a plug (threaded steel) where the sender should be. Is it possible
to remove the sender from the transaxle I am taking out and install it the
924S Trans? (I doubt that I could be so lucky!) or am I really screwed? Any
thoughts, ideas or commiserations will be gladly accepted.

BTW the new (rebuilt) water pump, rollers and belts went on easily. It sure
is nice working on well built machinery.

Chris White (Interesting note - my spell checker wants to change transaxle
to transsexual! Is it trying to tell me just how screwed I am?)
