The "keyway" has that much slop so that you can loosen the three M5 
bolts, then turn the sprocket to get the right lift at TDC, then lock 
down this timing by tightening the three bolts.  You'll need two dial 
indicators, one for the intake valve bucket (tappet) and one for the #1 
spark plug bore and so the #1 piston.

You also need a dial indicator kit that lets you read the top of the #1 
cylinder.  You can get it from Baum Tool, not a lot of money and very 
useful. You need the angled dial indicator tip that the factory manual 
recommends (as do I) to read the tappet.  Both dial indicator probes 
are metric threaded, and so if you don't own dial indicators, get ones 
that are metric (e.g., from AST).

And you need a jig to hold the dial indicator for the #1 tappet - I use 
the VW tool recommended by the factory, a good investment because it 
can be used for a ton of applications.  Get it from Zelenda.  There's 
not enough steel around the 944S head to make a
magnetic-based jog work!
