Tony,
I installed my chip and adjustable boost at 90,000. Also an aftermarket
boost gauge just to keep an eye on things. I was running about 17lbs.
but the turbo would still spin at cruising speeds (70-80). 
As far as the chip choices there are many, many come with a way to bring
up boost as the stock setting is around 11 or 12lbs.
I personnally chose Superchips inc. They came with an underhood
adjustment for raising boost, that works in conjunction with the chips. 
The difference was astounding as it felt like there was another 100 or
so horses with just with the chip and boost at 17.
As far as the fuel leave it stock until you find that you need more.
Try and do one mod at a time & evaluate them 1 at a time.

By the way how did you make out with the wandering back end?

<FONT FACE="Arial">These cars are built in the typical German tradition of well engineered
solidity. The sheer competence of the chassis makes the performance
of these cars quite non-dramatic even though 0 - 60 times of 6
seconds and top speeds of 150 MPH indicate power levels which
are quite out of the ordinary. Part of the lack of drama and excitement
comes from the sophisticated engine management system which uses
two computers, one to control the fueling and timing and the other
to supervise the knock sensor and the boost control.
</FONT></P>

Simply reprogramming the overboost cutout out of the standard
system allows the use of upto 17 PSI and at full throttle the
car feels dramatically quicker. The boost control  computer limits
the boost level so that only  low boost is available unless full
throttle is used. We reprogrammed it so that more boost is available
on part throttle and this gave the car terrific responsiveness
under part throttle driving conditions. The car came alive and
seemed willing and eager to go. Slight changes in throttle position
had the car accelerating rapidly and the boost control was so
progressive allowing the driver to have real control over his
machine. The part throttle response alone was considered a vast
improvement in the car.
</FONT></P>
<P>
<I><B><FONT FACE="Arial">To ensure that the engines' life was not reduced in any
way, the boost pressure was limited to 14 PSI and this gave 281
HP on the 220 HP engine and 315 HP on the 250 HP engine. On the
220 HP engine the peak torque increased from 243 lb. ft at 3500
RPM to 325 lb. ft at 4100 RPM.</FONT></B></I><FONT FACE="Arial"> The safety aspects of the
boost control unit are not changed in any way and if the computer
detects any pinging it will still reduce the boost and retard
the ignition. You should still use the best quality fuel you can
get for this car though as less than premium will reduce the power
available. The cold starting and in town running remain the same
and there is no down side to the  conversion. The car remains
as pleasant to drive off boost as it was before. Fuel consumption
and engine wear relate to how hard the car is being used and in
normal driving will be no different. It is not until you put your
foot down that this conversion makes itself apparent. At part
throttle, on boost, the car feels as if it is raring to go, and
when you give it full throttle the acceleration is enormous. The
forward thrust is incredible. The chassis and traction of the
car are now exploited to the full allowing very rapid overtaking
maneuvers which are so safe because of the vast increase in mid
range torque.
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">
     To relate some of these power levels into performance figures,
on the 220 HP engine the 0-60 times is down from 6.0 seconds to
5.1 seconds and the top speed will be up by about 5 MPH to around
165 MPH. The in gear increments change equally as dramatically.
30 -50 MPH drops  from 7.7 sec. to 5.2 sec. and 50 -70 drops from
8.4 to 5.9 seconds. It all translates into a superb driving package
- the car you thought you were going to get when you bought it!
