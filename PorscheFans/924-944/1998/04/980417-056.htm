Here's a question for Jim or anyone else.  BTW - thanks for all the great
responses.  I feel better knowing that this does occur on other cars as
well!

What is the consensus on using old head studs or should they be replaced
with new ones?  The shop says it's a bear to remove the old studs, so they
just leave them in there and re-use them.  They feel that taking the old
ones out causes more problems than it's worth and have never had a problem
with leakage using old head studs.

But, I always thought that head studs stretch to some extent when torqued
which keeps tension on the assembly.  So, when you release the tension,
do the head studs "contract" so to speak or are they forever stretched
to some extent?  If they stay stretched, then re-using them and torquing
to factory spec would stretch the threads rather than the stud if you
know what I mean???
