Rob, I feel your pain!!!  I went through your pain 2
weeks ago.  Next time, my mechanic can do it!  Its
worth the 1-2 hours labor charge plus parts!!!!!  The
good side of it is I did learn alot about the car and the
replacement fixed my high temp problem.   It took me
about 5-6 hours (pretty much all day Saturday)  which
included bleeding the damn thing!

Fortunately,  my mechanic, Manny, let me use his
snap ring pliers.  I don't know if there specially made
for the 944 but it is designed to fit into the holes of the
snap ring.  Anyway....With my father-in-law holding
the pliers from the top, I had to get underneath the car
and guide the pliers into the snap ring holes.  It
worked fine but I had to remove the power steering
pump from its holder first (a trick my Manny told me)
and let it hang out of the way.  Manny told me that
sometimes he uses a hammer and screw driver and
gently taps the snap ring around to an area that gives
him better access with the pliers (and I'm sure the car
is on a lift..)

If your really frustrated and the thermostat is still in the
waterpump, I would suggest putting everything back
together and have a mechanic do it!  Even with the
right tool, the job is a real, real, real pain!

Hope this help
