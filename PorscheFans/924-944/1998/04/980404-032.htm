 You have got to be one of the MOST UNLIKED people on the porschefans
newslist.
 If you want to send me more business, then keep bad mouthing me...becaus=
e
 everytime you do, the phone rings off the hook, and people tell me what =
an
 ASSHOLE YOU ARE!!!   So, why don't you just quit your pissing and whinin=
g
(on
 the web) and pretend like you are a "Big Boy", and grow up.  Oh, by the
way,
 everyone on Porschefans is really impressed that you are a "Dr.", as no
one
 else with a Porsche is nearly as educated as you are!! >>

Let me get this straight, in one corner we have Steve Timmins who is one =
of
our resident experts on wheels, offsets, tires and things mechanical.  He=

answers our questions in accurate detail and never complains that the sam=
e
question has been asked several times before.  I cannot remember him ever=

writing anything but helpful advice.  His only failing is that he lives
east of the Rockies and might be called geographicly challanged.

In the other corner we have Eurospeed.  Now is this the same Ron from
Eurospeed that was the subject of list flames about a year ago?  Many
members responded that they were given false ship date information which
caused them problems in completing their repairs before track dates. Ther=
e
was one list member that had ordered parts, had his credit card charged a=
nd
never received the parts.  Follow up phone calls were not returned and
several list members had to reorder their parts elsewhere.  Now if this i=
s
not the same Eurospeed then MHA.  If this is a different Eurospeed, maybe=

we should chip in and send him a bottle of Prozac.  If it is the same
Eurospeed, then it looks like it is business as usual for him.
