Dear All
Came across this and thought I would share

Quoted in the Guardian newspaper(UK), taken from The need for speed in a
magazine called i-D
(begin quote)

Sometimes a name becomes synonymous with an industry. A brand takes over a
market position to such a degree that it defines a sector. This kind of
‘brand religion’ is difficult to attain. It takes years of concentrated,
consistent effort. It requires vision, passion, belief; a ruthless drive for
perfection that goes beyond regular business and production and focuses on
the soul, the very spirit of the product. Porsche is such a brand.
Porsche owns the adjectives of speed and elegance, power and control. If you
drive a Porsche you are part of a tribe, a church that worships purity and
adrenaline. You live in a world where air cooled horses are encased in
Teutonic glory and are packaged up in Bauhaus design. You fly under the
protective talisman of the Stuttgart coat of arms, with its rampant black
horse on a yellow shield, surrounded by the colours and six stag horns from
the crest of the state of Baden-Wurttemsburg. You are part of the chosen,
the post-modern future. You rule. (end quote)

Apart from the air cooled reference I thought you might like this. No flames
please.
