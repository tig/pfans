Very sorry to hear about your loss, Steve. But what's this "economy and
practicality" stuff, why is it on the "plus side", and don't those cars get
hit sometimes too?  You're not considering one of those front-wheel drive
things, are you? Get another Porsche.

This is the problem with my 86 951.  lately I have noticed that my brakes   
have been acting like there is no boost assist when I press on the pedal.   
 It seems to be worse at the end when I am actually coming to a complete   
stop.  The braking seems to be better at higher speed.  I've considered a   
vacuum problem but could not find any apparent leaks.  Also, last weekend   
I put new pads on all four wheels.  No change.  At this point, I don't   
think I could lock the brakes if I wanted.  Could this be ABS's great   
grandfather or do I have a booster/vacuum problem.  How do I check the   
booster?  What else could it be?
