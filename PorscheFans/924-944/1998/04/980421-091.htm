[a whole bunch of very expensive stuff deleted]

And just so other owners don't get too freaked out, my son's '89 951 has
required a $70 water hose fix, a $70 belt adjustment, and a $300 sunroof
repair, plus one set of S-02s.  That's it.  I believe both cars were
purchased Aug '96.

Is this really a wise thing to do?  Sure, you can run it at the track and
have some fun, but wouldn't you want to stay within reason?  You really
sound like you need to blow off some energy.  Kick ass in the kart and go
moderate with the turbo.

Why so whimpy?  A local guy down here has 315s on his 951 on 11" wide
