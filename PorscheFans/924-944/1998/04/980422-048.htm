Agreed.

Okay so far.

Woops.   Friction is a contributor, but it isn't the main force holding
the assembly together.   If you do vector analysis (I don't EVEN want to
go there!), the angle of the thread (pitch) will determine the force
vectors.   Simple physics that if the linear force parallel with the
bolt is greater than the force perpendicular (math will calculate those
values), the nut will not turn.

Agreed.......the head/stud combination is so important that Porsche
wants to insure service work to put things back together as consistently
as possible.
