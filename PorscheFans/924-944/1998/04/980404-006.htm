For those of you with non-turbo 944's and have been thinking about chipping
the DME, you might find this interesting. I have a 1988 944S and 3 months
ago, I bought an Autothority chip for my DME.
(http://www.autothority.com/html/porsche2.htm) Installed it as per the
instructions and drove it for 100 miles to allow the DME to adjust itself
according to my driving conditions (I was told this by Autothority). To make
a long story with this chip short, I ended up returning it for a refund.  It
seemed like the midrange throttle response around 3500-4500 rpm was
diminished, and there was only a noticeable added punch at 6000 rpm. Not
very usable. Autothority claims an 18 horsepower gain. I highly doubt it.

Last week, I was ordering some parts from Europroducts
(http://www.porsche-911.com/html/94485-88.htm) and when I asked the sales
guy what specials do you have right now, he said that they have their brand
of DME chips on sale for $129. (the Autothority was more than double that).
It had the same 30 day guarantee, so I said what the hell. I stuck the chip
in last night.

Wow!

From 2500-5000 rpm, the throttle response is much improved, and at 5000 the
power comes on and you really notice the difference. (for those who own
944S's you know about the 16-valve "turbo-like" lag) There was an almost
instant difference in the performance of the car. Much more than I expected.
Europroducts claims a 14 horsepower gain. I thoroughly believe it.

I must say that this was the best $129 bucks I have spent on my car. I can
highly recommend this chip to anyone who is wondering if the dollar-per-hp
on a non-turbo car is worth it.

Sincerely,

Jason Maynard
