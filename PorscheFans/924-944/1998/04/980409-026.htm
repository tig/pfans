OK, as you know, I'm taking my car in to the dealer next week, so I need
to soak up some of your collective knowledge before I drop it off. My
car is a '93 968 with 43,500 miles.

Aside from belt replacement, here's what it's going in for: 

Clutch problem #1
-----------------
When I depress the clutch pedal, I feel a slight vibration, that seems
to be directly coupled to RPM's. Really noticeable in 1st and 2nd gears.
I've read some archived posts where some people talk about bad engine
mounts as the probable cause. The thing is, I haven't noticed any
unusual vibration at idle, or on the steering wheel.

Cluth problem #2
----------------
This one is more subtle: when I'm stopped at a traffic light, and I
press the clutch to put the car in first gear, I hear a slight "clunk"
coming from the engine compartment. I've read about the rubber-center
saga, but I thought that the 968's came with the improved 951-type
center. Is that correct?

Are these two problems something that you should expect a dealer to fix
under the Porsche-Certified warranty? Should I demand that they replace
any clutch parts?

I'm having a blast with this car, and I want to keep him healthy,
especially while he's under warranty! (By the way, I refer to the car in
masculine gender, as my wife has named him "Klaus").

Thanks in advance!
