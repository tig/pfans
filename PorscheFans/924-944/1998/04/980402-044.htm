Try lightly pressing on the brake while driving. If the rattling stops, it
is your rear brake pads rattling. Usually happens with MetalMaster pads,
but with others also. Fix is to get a thin strip of aluminum, cut it the
depth of the pad, including the backing plate, and slide the strip under
the pad. (Must be aluminum--steel will score the rotors).
