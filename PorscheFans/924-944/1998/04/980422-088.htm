Hello fellow Porsche owners-
Thanks everyone who responded to my past questions it has been a great
help. Once again I am in need of some expert opinions. I have a 84 944 that
has a hesitation problem, I notice it mainly during acceleration in the
2500-4000 rpm range. It sometimes also happens during cruising at highway
speeds. It feels as if the car being held back by a really strong wind,
like when a semi goes by. I also own a 86 Mazda RX-7 that has a similar
problem but only between 2500-3200 rpm's. It feels like a "dead spot". If
anyone has any ideas what might be causing this, please let me know.
Thanks Everyone-
Chris 

P.S. In my owners manual there is a picture that is upside down, the
picture is of the center counsel gages, heater control and radio area.
Anyone else's like this?
