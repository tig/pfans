rattling woes still

thanks for all the responses from you guys out there.i wish i would have
known about this board a long time ago.so heres the deal,i had the local
muffler shop check the exhaust.the dealer and i checked everything
else,the wiper,rear glass,brakes,brake cables,hatch locks,the entire
enchillada!this is what we came up with,apparently it is the waste gate
spring RATTLING at the rpm range of 1800-2200!it honestly sounds like it
is coming from the rear,but it is the wastegate spring.the dealer says
the wastegate is in good condition and reccomend not replacing it.this
car is somewhat modified{chips,k&n,nology,3inch exhaust and no cat}.has
anybody experienced this? i was actually thinking about changing the
wastegate to a high performance after-market unit.i would appreciate so
input from some enthusiats!

                                 thanks,
                                      tim
                                      86 951
p.s.this is for the steve that emailed me.i have already experienced all
these shops!i would not post anything i didnt feel was appropriate.when
i went to black forrest to have the alternator  covered under
warranty,guess what the response was from black forrest?it wasnt our
fault!!!!after three months and the warranty was never filled.all im
saying steve is to give another shop like the dealer a try.ive had 3
different porsches in the last 4 years and i know about the porsche
problems and i know when i getted ripped off!!!!now about the warranty
from the dealer,i recently went in because my throttle switch [944S]was
bad.i replaced it at the dealer in june of 96.it went out in feb of
98.now guess what the response was from the dealer?no problem the parts
and labor our covered under warranty and we will extend your warranty
for another two years.now i dont have to worry about my throttle switch
till feb 2000.pioneer centers will also install any aftermarket
high-performance parts and cover the labor for two years unlimited
mileage!here is a list of stuff i did at the local independants on one
car in the last three years:rebuilt tranny,head gasket,waterpump,timing
belt,hoses,air flow meter,cv,alternator just to name a few.so steve
guess how many of these things the dealer had to redo in a period of a
year?ALL this stuff! this list of stuff was performed by dieters,black
forrest,perfection and volkers and you know what not one shop EVER
carried out ANY warranty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
