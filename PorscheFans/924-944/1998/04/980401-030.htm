There is a local '77 924 Martini advertised for $2000.  Can anyone tell
me
about the upgrades that were on the car?  I'm not in any trouble with my
wife so it is time to buy another car.

Jim,

	The Martini was a heavily upgraded car.  In fact, it is the most
significant model variant in the entire 924/944/968 line-up.  You know
that performance cam everyone is talking about?  Well, it was first used
on the Martini 924.  Other upgrades include:

- Big Red calipers
- adjustable Koni's
- adjustable power without the use of chips (use that idle srew on the
throttle body and dial in +/- 50 hp)
- special edition toolkit that includes hockey puck jack-pads
- special hatch with lightweight lock arms (these tend to squeak on
bumps)
- humidor in each of those rear quarter panel cubbies
- premium stereo system (4X6 speakers in doors and under rear quarter
window)
- Snowflake A/C switch that will only stay depressed when freon is fully
charged

It must be April Fools because you said you're not in trouble with your
wife!
