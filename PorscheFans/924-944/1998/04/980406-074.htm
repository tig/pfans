Hi P-fans,

I really need the collective wisdom of this list now.

Yesterday evening I started my car and had no oil pressure for
around 3 seconds, all lights in the dashboard were on.

The sound of the motor was normal. I just decided to shut it
down, then suddenly the oil pressure was there and the lights
went out.

I drove home carefully and listened for unusual sounds but 
everything was perfect.

This morning I started the car, no pressure, all lights on,
and after 3 seconds the lifters were starting to make horrible
sounds, so there was really no pressure. I shut the engine 
down, tried again, no pressure at all.

Oil level is ok, just under the top mark. The oil filter was
changed with the oil around 3000 miles ago.

Where do I have to search for the problem?

The car is a 86 944 NA, not modified in any way.

As always, thanks in advance
