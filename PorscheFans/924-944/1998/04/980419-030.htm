Folks,

Last week Roxanne posted asking about the possiblity
of polishing out damaged portions of her windshield.
Gregor D chimed in, saying that his suffers from wiper
haze.  I wrote back that I'd purchased Eastwood Co's
glass polishing kit to fix the wiper haze on my
own car (90 S2 w/ 63k mi), and I'd report back when
I'd tried it.

Put shortly, this was the LEAST effective time I've
ever spent caring for my car.

I spent over three hours with strong lighting, a
breathing mask, rags, drop cloths draped over the patient,
my trusty electric drill, and Eastwood's
buffing wheel and cerium oxide powder.  The windshield's
marginally better now, but still not good.  I think
it would take another 3 hrs or more to produce good results.
It just takes a heck of a long time to polish this stuff
out.  [The scratches on my windshield meet Eastwood's shallowness
criterion -- i.e. can you drag your fingernail over it without
feeling the marks.] Getting it done uniformly over a large area of the
windshield (e.g. to deal with wiper-induced haze) doesn't
seem likely unless you've significantly more patience and/or
skill than me.
