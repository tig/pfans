first owner complained of the same "rattling from the rear end".  It was
always checked, but on subsequent scheduled maintenance visits, the
"rattling" was always mentioned to the servicer (a Porsche dealer).
Long story short, I still have the infamous "rattle" at almost exactly
the RPM range you mentioned.  It does sound like it's coming from the
rear.

I hate to punch a hole in the wastegate theory but my S2 rattles also.  T=

wastegate consists of a valve, a seat, a spring and a pusher diaphram. =

Somewhere at excess of 15 lbs of boost, the valve unseats on its own
volition to bleed the overboost exhaust.  I have yet to see a 951 turbo
that would crank 15 lbs at 2000 to 2500 rpm.

If the rattle isn't a heat shield, I would suspect the transaxle.  Someon=

once told me that the gears rattle.  Probably some Teutonic safety featur=
e
to keep us alert..  I think Kevin Gross made reference to the sound of
dragging chains.  Marley's ghost perhaps? The sound is most noticable in
both my turbo and S2 when backing off on the gas.

Any of the resident experts have any theories on the dragging chain
syndrone?
