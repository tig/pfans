Jon:

I installed the MAF on my 1988 951 (non-S) at the same time I swapped
the K-27T6 turbo with a "S" Turbo.  The increase in bottom-end torque
and driveability was amazing!!  With the non-S turbo in your car, you
would virtually eliminate lag.  In addition, the sound of the air
rushing into to the cone filter when you put your foot into it is
something you have to hear to appreciate!

Although this is an expensive upgrade ($1,450 - $1,650) compared to
just swapping chips ($250 - $450), I feel that it is well worth it.  I
think the 310 hp figure is fairly accurate as well.  However, if you
haven't done chips yet, I would reccomend this as your first upgrade
as you will be amazed by the increase in power and driveability.

With the MAF installed in my car along with the "S" turbo, my car
would spin the tires to redline in 1st, 2nd and most of 3rd on cold,
dry days during this past winter here in New England; something to
think about...
