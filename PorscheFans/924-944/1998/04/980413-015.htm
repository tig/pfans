I have bitten the bullet to sort the oil leaks on my 944. I am also fitting
the larger cam belt idler which the PO failed to do when he changed the
water pump.
I have to cut the timing cover and the diagram in PNA 000147 page 145 sees
clear enough. Without wishing to resurrect the ol' belt saga can anyone
point me to an archive reference about reassembly. I'm using Haynes as a
start and have made notes during strip down, I just don't want to miss out
anything.
The front seals were done a year ago by a local garage when I bought the car
but it still leaks.(not the seals) Having done the cam belt, distributor
housing O rings etc. I find the leak is from the upper balance shaft O ring
and also at the rear of the balance shaft, the disc is just rattling around
in there and explains the oil leaks.
Also broken is the adjuster for the power steering belt. The eye bolt had
sheared.
Help if you can I'm back to the garage to continue with cleaning the parts
for assembly

TIA
