Don't have the Carbon Fiber, but owning a classic Mercedes Benz, I had to 
have some real wood to contrast the stark interior.  Looking at the kits 
out there, ($$$$$) I wanted some new mechanical pieces more (Belts, Rollers 
Chain Tensioner, etc..).

 I found a Walnut Veneer kit at my local Home Builders supply store that 
had a glue backing that was activated with heat. (Iron or heat gun). Took 
my dash strip off, along with the Window switch area and made templates for 
all.   Cut the veneer to match, attached with the heat, finished the edges 
with black marker, and then applied a spray on Deftthane quick dry finish. 
 One weekend and it looks great.   I took photos with my camera of the 
steps and I'm going to write an article for others to try.   Total cost was 
less than $25.00.

Trying to talk the wife into giving me the rest of the 650.00 for some new 
Koni's and a Roll Bar.

Second Item:

Is anyone going to the Swap meet at Hershey?  Haven't been before so I was 
wondering if it was worth the effort (6-8 hrs on the worst drive around 
here-Cincinnati). If anyone is going let me know, like to meet some of you 
guys (sorry Rox, no slight intended).  My usual venture outside of races is 
the annual Kruse auction at Auburn IN during Labor Day, with a stop over at 
Indy for the Nationals on Sun/Mon. (Still like that straight line 
acceleration routine)  If you like cars from all years this a great event. 
 Some great buys can be had.   Neat memorabilia stuff also.
