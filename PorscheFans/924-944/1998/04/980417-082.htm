derek,


i disagree with you about back pressure and turbo's.any knowledgable
mechanic will tell you that the bigger the exhaust with the a turbo
car the better.i think some of you need to pick up TURBO magazine for
a little insight on the advantages of a nice exhaust system.unlike you i
noticed a great improvement in low end torqe,even with a gutted cat.i
now have 1 bar of boost at 2250rpm and full boost at 3200rpm.i have
stage two chips,k&n and nology.ialso believe the maf will help out
more with a bigger turbo and huge exhaust system.no back pressur is
required with ANY TURBO ENGINE!!!!!

===========================================

Tim:

The flames; aagh I'm burning here!!!  Just kidding...

Anyway, I have been subscribing to TURBO for close to a year now
(nothing like the concern of every 951 owner of getting beat by a
turbo'd and nitrous'd Honda Civic to put the fear of God in you!) and
the first issue I received had an article on modifying 951s.  I
specifically remember:  "Turbo cars love BIG exhausts and the 944
Turbo is no exception" so I agree with you in this respect.  However,
I can tell you from personal experience (see previous e-mail) that my
low-end torque went out the door when I cut off the muffler!!

You don't mention if you have an aftermarket muffler/exhaust system or
just the gutted cat.  Everyone on this list will agree that
eliminating the cat does indeed result in a decrease in turbo lag and
possibly an increase in power.  However, I'm inclined to agree with
the message from ? a few weeks that stated that there was a minimum
amount of backpressure that is necessary for the car to have some
semblance of driveability.  I have a Borla XR-1 race muffler in
addition to the gutted cat and my low-end response is great (probably
due to the MAF); I'm not sure if I gained any power by swapping the
muffler.

As respects the MAF with a big turbo, Randall can attest that it works
great with the K-27T6 as opposed to the smaller K-26S8 in my car and
the K-26(6) in your car Tim.  As we've ALL agreed before, more flow =
more power.

Please see Menelaos' comments on the necessity of backpressure; I
think he raises some good points.

Feel free to "FLAME ON" as I will not be back to respond until Monday
morning (this list is stress relief for me at the office).

Have a good weekend everybody!!
