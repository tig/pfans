Hello all,

I am looking for a few parts and any advice as I am preparing my '83 944 to
compete in SCCA's ITS class.

Parts wanted:
--(4) 15x7" track wheels, prefer cookie cutters, but would consider early
phone dials.  Wheels can be ugly as sin, but must be straight and true.

--Stock sway bars off of a '88 or '89 944 Turbo S (do I need bigger
bushings/mounts, or do I just need the bars?)

--I am looking for racing seats if anyone has a used set theyd like to part
with.

--Who makes a nice kit/has parts for removing the fog lights and instead
ducting to the front brakes on an early 944?

--I am looking to replace my stock steering wheel, anyone have a smaller
diameter racing wheel they want to sell?  Or recommend a nice one.  I have
a stock 4 spoke and it seems like Id benefit from having a wheel that is
both smaller and about 2" further out from the dash.  (I have very little
clearance between the bottom of the wheel and my legs, at 6' tall and 170
pounds)

--Tires: Max dia. & width rim for my car in this class is 15" x 7".  BFG
Comp TA R1s are available in 225-50R15 (606mm O.D.), however this would be
smaller diameter than stock 215-60R15 (639mm O.D.).  I am thinking that it
would be beneficial to run a wider tire for better cornering and a smaller
tire for a shorter gearing effect, but am looking for advice from the list.
 Another option is 205-60R15 (215-60R15 is not an available R1 size)  I am
leaning heavily toward the 225-50R15s right now...

--I will consider any strut braces or rigid upper strut mounts, hard
suspension bushings etc. anyone has for sale/ or recommend high quality
manufacturers, my need is not immediate but may be by late summer.

thanks,
Brian Doll
