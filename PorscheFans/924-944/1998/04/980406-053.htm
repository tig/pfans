Brian,
Try and get the repair & maint. records. One of the items that should be
done at 30,000 mile intervals is the timing belt, This should cost less
than $500, when you test drive it make sure your boost gauge just about
pegs at 2 when you give it full throttle, you don't want any boost
problems from the start
they can be tricky & costly to deal with. The brakes are another item to
not overlook as they are 4 piston Brembo's. A new rotor here & a new
caliper there can also be quite costly. The trans and clutch are
definate areas to have checked (a new clutch can cost over $1000 to have
done professionally)
with parts alone in the $600 range and a full weekend to d i y.
Lastly check the engine. These engines are bulletproof, however this
does not apply if the previous owner never changed the oil.

I would definately have a Porsche certified mechanic look it over if you
are unfamiliar with a Porsche.
