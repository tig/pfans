Hello Pfans
I got my first question answer by George B. while the list was being funky
this afternoon. This has precipitated a second and third questions -
- Does anyone have a 85 1/2 or later non turbo transaxle in good condition
for sale?
- Does anyone need a 924S transaxle that is in great shape?
It turns out that I purchased a 924S transaxle with the mistaken assumption
that it was the same as the 944. It is except for the speedometer pick up.
As I was starting to remove the old transaxle I compared the two and drat
foiled again.

So if anyone can help please let me know.
