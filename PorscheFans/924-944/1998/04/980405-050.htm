Worn syncros.  Bad news.

Not normal.  The door should close with a solid, German thunk, unless it 
has been abused or the car has 300,000 miles on it.  IMHO, a repaint 
(especially an obvious one) signifies a questionable past.  If it was not 
wrecked, it probably sat out in the sun a lot, or was otherwise neglected.

I would keep looking, unless this car is cheap, and you are willing to
invest some $$$ and time to get it into the condition you desire.  Its
easier to better to find a good car, so you can spend more time driving
it, and less time fixing what the PO neglected.
