With the cheap replacable tips you can file a little cut into the end of
the
tip to better catch the edge of the ring.

best done from below also.

Has anyone tried one of the new retaining ring remover that Automotion ha=

advertised on p.183?  Having fought the battle once, I would pay the $23.=

not to have that good time again.  However as of late, removing the
retaining ring is no problem.  Having the engine out of the car makes it
alot easier.  Try it and save the expense of the tool.
