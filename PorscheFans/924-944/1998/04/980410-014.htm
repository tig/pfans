Tony,
Your boost seems about normal for a stock 951. I have an aftermarket
gauge installed along side the factory one. On the factory gauge 1 = 0
on the aftermarket gauge. At 2 on the factory gauge I am at 15 on the
afternarket gauge. I think the factory setting for an 86 is about 11 lbs
max. I am not sure of this number as I installed the aftermarket gauge
at the same time as the bleeder valve & chips.
