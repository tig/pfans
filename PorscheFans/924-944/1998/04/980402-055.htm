I have owned a Martini for about six months.  I believe there were only
about 3000 of them produced making them collectable.  I would assume plenty
of them have been destroyed in the last 20 years.  The upgrades are mostly
cosmetic; different wing mirrors, red carpet, red seat inserts with blue
piping, badge on centre console, white paint, Martini stripes, white alloy
rims.  I think they also came with a suspension upgrade but I'm not sure of
this.  Mine has front and rear sway bars but I'm not sure if they are
standard on a regular 1977 924.  Mine also has the lift out roof panel which
I think was optional.  If you have a close look at the car could you please
let me know what the VIN is. I'm trying to compile a list of VINs for the
Martini.  I would be happy to answer any other questions you may have.
