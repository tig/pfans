Hello Porsche Fans,
  Recently I write about my success with replacement of my A/C compressor in 
my 87' 944 NA. I guess it was too good to be true. My car is now paying the 
price for my comfort. I cannot get my car to stay at a normal temperature 
with the A/C running (I live in central Florida, and it is in the mid 80's 
today). With the A/C off, it runs warmer than normal, but can maintain 
itself. With the A/C on, no way. Even at highway speeds, it overheats. 
AAAHHHHH!! 
  History lesson:
    A year ago, the coolant and thermostat was changed (got the thermostat 
from Porsche). Coolant was Mercedes coolant. Porsche says it is the same 
thing. Mix was 50/50. No A/C last summer. Could not afford the compressor. 
Engine temp. fairly normal. But, the stuff I drained out that the previous 
owner had in there was GREEN??!! I know it could not be the orange 
phosphate-free stuff we are supposed to use. Right?? When I bought the car, 
it maintained correct temp. normally. (I should have left it alone.)
   Today, I changed the coolant again. Same type of stuff went back in at 
50/50 mix. I even added a 10" fan in front of the condinser to give a 
push-pull effect on the air flow. No help.
   I am at my wit's end. The water pump seems to be doing it's job. The 
system moves coolant. When it overheats too much, it boils over until it is 
flowing out of the overflow tank drain. 
   Am I using the wrong mix of coolant? Does oil viscosity have any huge 
bearing on the engine temp? Right now I have regular 10W-40 in it. Should I 
be using 15W-30 or 20W-50 in this weather?
   I need "THE COLLECTIVE'S" help fast. I do not want to roast or crack the 
block, or I will become a "former" 944 owner. I love my car too much to want 
that to happen. HELP??!!
     Todd.
