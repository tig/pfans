During my first auto-x a couple of weeks ago, I noticed that when I put
on my helmet, I can no longer fit in my car! The top of the helmet hits 
the headliner. Taking the sunroof off still doesn't help, as the helment
actually bangs against the part of the roof that's just ahead of the
sunroof.

I find that if I slouch down in my seat, I fit OK, but this isn't
exactly a "proper" driving posture.

I'm only 6'1", but have long torso and stubby little legs. I guess I'm
not the typical Southern German type :-)

So here is the question for those of you who have installed sport
(aftermarket) seats on your 944/968, (Lee?): Are the seats higher, or
lower than the original seats? 

BTW, yes, I have set the factory seat as far as they will go (it has the
electric height adjustment, if that makes any difference).

TIA,
