	My 1987 944S met its demise yesterday courtesy of a red light running
idiot, and my failure to follow the rule I teach my kids that, here in South
Florida, it is akin to playing russian roulette to leave the line on a green
light without pausing a seocnd or two.

	I seriously doubt repairs can be economically made.  I have a four way
power seat switch (used from Kempton's) for $50; an intake manifold gasket
and perhaps other stuff for sale for those who would contact me direct.
Anyone interested in the whole car would be getting a parts bonanza.  As is
usually the case, I had just put $2000 in the car to fix the a/c and replace
all belts, rollers, and the water pump.  The front end sustained the blow,
so the car is good from the doors back.  There's a new battery in it; wet
okole seat covers (Black with red inserts); good dash...etc. The wheels (15"
cookie cutters) are good.  There's a K&N air filter lying around somewhere
(The air box was nauled).

	On the plus side, I guess I'll have a chance to consider economy and
practicality in my new automotive choice (excuse me while I puke).  I think
I'll miss the list as much as the car.
