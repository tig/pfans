<< After talking to OG Racing this morning, I learned that the Camberballs
only
 work with the old style (pre 1985.5) strut plates, so late model cars need to
 have the older plates retrofitted.  Since these are easy to find and cheap,
 I'll go ahead and do it.  OG told me they usually tell folks about this when
 they buy the parts, and they may well have told me, but it just didn't
 penetrate my thick skull.
 
 At any rate, OG promptly returned my call, were very friendly, and have
 returned to my list of those in good graces. >>

Actually, I think it was around '87 that the design of the strut plate
changed.  I had an 85.5 that I equipped with Camberballs using the original
strut mounting plates.
