Dave:

At Loudon,NH (NHIS), even after the cool down lap i drive around the
infield for about another 5 min.

Your brakes as well as suspension are different but i think my comments
still generally apply.

The rotors are availble thru:

Diversified Cryogenics 1-888-323-8456

They claim a 130% increase in rotor life..., less fade, smoother braking,
more braking "power"  whiter whites etc..... i'll let you know at the end
of the season. Cost for a 951 was about $130 ea.

I forgot to mention that as part of my rear brake bias improvemnt program
we worked on reducing weight transfer. This involve stiffer (&lower)
springs up front and Koni adjustables all around. The results were
impressive... at the last DE my instructor who has been twidling with his
951 remarked at how well balanced the car felt...he said he was actually
somewhat envious because he had just spent another $4K and still didn't
have it quite right. An autocross instructor also confirmed the "good"
balance. I think the moral is Porsche did a pretty reasonable job unless
you get very seriously "into it" and are willing to make some big
compromises on everyday driveability.

My other mods have been BFG R1s (f 225/ r 245), 5 point-Harness/Bar, Pagid
brake pads (they cost$, squeal and create lots of dust... but as my
mechanic said "they work"... even as street pads.By far the most bang for
the buck has been the tires. i have them mounted on my original 16" forged
"dish" wheels and i got a set of 993 take off 5 spokes for everyday
driving. Some people use them as everyday tires, but they can be squirrely
in the rain...not good characteristics for street tires in New England. I
did not change stock sway bars.

I think a lot of people make too many changes at once and end up upsetting
the already good balance of these cars. They also don't really get a feel
for what changes gave which results.  Go slow on improvements... but do
things that are consistent with your long term goals for the car so you
don't end up doing them twice... or worse. As my mechanic also pointed
out... if you took all the % gains claimed by mfgs for their devices and
installed them all you would expect at least 700 Hp and 3G cornering out of
a 951... obviously not possible.

As far as strut brace goes my understanding is that with the top of the
shocks mounted in rubber and all the other rubber bushings in the
suspension there isn't much improvement... and you have added a lot of
unecessary weight up high. 

Keep in mind i am new at this as well... just my .03 worth. Or as my Dad
used to say "advice is worth what you pay for it".
