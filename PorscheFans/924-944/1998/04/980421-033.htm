Dear 944 fans,

I have been lurking on your list for a few weeks now whilst pondering
whether to purchase a late 80's 944 Turbo, or to follow my aircooled
roots and go for a mid '80's 911. Just as I came down on the side of the
944T having seen a beautiful '89 65k mile two owner this weekend, and
now  I see all sorts of problems (expensive problems) being aired on the
list about the 944T, poor design, dodgy waterpumps, to name two of the
topics discussed recently. Before I hand over my hard earned cash (quite
a lot of it actually, the seller will not budge from his asking price of
=A314k and I can't fault the car so.........) I would welcome some
feedback to the list or privately (paw@kpi.q8.co.uk) as to the real
probable running costs and likely problems associated with the 944T, or
the advantages over say a '85 3.2 911????? The car I am considering is
an unmarked white 250bhp '89 model with full dealer service history,
factory 10 speaker hi-fi, polished 17" alloys, black leather sports
seats, cruise etc. all of which add up to a very attractive package and
also a lot of potential expense if the record of failures is
poor........

I want to have the car professionally inspected, and if any UK
subscribers know of good 944 pro's who might look the car over for me in
the S.E. pls let me know.

Many thanks.
