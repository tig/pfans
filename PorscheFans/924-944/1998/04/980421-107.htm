Skip Carter owns a racer supply shop in San Diego.  He is the past
president of the San Diego region, past and current newsletter publisher
and long time board member and club volunteer.

I have bought tires from him and have sent others to him.  He is a good g=
uy
who does what he says he will.  =


The R-1s we have on the S2 were heat cycled by Skip in his big oven.  He
baked us a cake at the same time.  Two of us have driven the snot out of
the R-1s since last summer and they still have some life left on them.
