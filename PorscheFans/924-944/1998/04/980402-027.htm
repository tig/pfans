 Darren, you better believe it! I had the gasket job done under warranty
after an unbelievable fight with my dealer.
Whilst they were at it I asked them to change the cam belt. Now, because I
was unaware of its existence and because I was forcing them to pay for their
appalling lack of competence in accepting that the gasket was bust, they
obviously chose not to change the balance shaft belt. You guessed it. About
18 months later the balance shaft belt broke and got itself entangled in the
cam belt. Result, 1200 pounds (god knows how many C$) lighter of pocket and
just a little bit angry!

DON'T DISREGARD THAT BALANCE SHAFT BELT!

I have quite a few horror stories but I try not to think about them since my
escape from the asylum!

Regards,

Clive
