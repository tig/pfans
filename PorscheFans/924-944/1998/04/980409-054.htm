Not sure what you are asking. 45mph is waay too slow for 5th. The car is
supposed to lug at that speed, except on an extremely flat or downhill
surface. My '84 is notably sleepy at anything under 3k RPM, except in
1st gear. Fifth gear is not your pick-up-and-go gear even at 90mph (4th
goes through 110mph) so 45 mph in 5th will not make your car happy.
Those are some pretty big pistons you are moving and displacing, you
will not get much response out of the motor before 3k RPM.

Idle speed can be adjusted by the set screw next to the throttle cam. If
you feel the motor is lugging more than before you may want to check
mixture with a CO meter (your O2 sensor may be misbehaving). A bottle of
Techron is unlikely to have any dramatic effects, more a long-term
measure.
