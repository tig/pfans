Hello PFans,
This is my first post to the list, so I hope it  works out.
What are the recommendations's on changing to synthetic motor oil?
My car is an 88 951 with 58k miles.
It is currently in the shop having the belts, water pump, front engine reseal,
oil pump seal, power steering reservoir hose update, and all fluids changed.
The car is driven under 5k per year. I hope to do 2-3 DE's this year.
The 2 PO used regular oil. What can I expect in the way of oil leaks? The car
wasn't leaking any oil. The above work is being done as preventive
maintenance. 
The car also had a problem of "cutting-out" in 4th or 5th gear under full
throttle and full boost. The shop diagnoses this as a bad cycle valve, which
they are replacing.
Does this sound correct? (Part- $75.00 Labor-4hrs)
TIA!
