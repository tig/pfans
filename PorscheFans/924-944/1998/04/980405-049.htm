I'm trying to step into the ranks of Porsche owner, and I
have a few questions about a particular car.  It's a 1984
944 with 112,000 miles on it.

It seems that most of the body seals (i.e. the sunroof,
window and door seals) are dry and cracking.  The dash
shows obvious sun damage.  The interior also seems to have
been redone by a dealership at some point in time.  The
passenger side window won't work and the passenger side of
the hatch won't release.

The exterior shows what a 14 year old car should.  It has
some rock damage and 1 spot on the front-right where it's
been sanded down to the metal to avoid a little rust spot
from spreading.  It also has some interesting "rock guards
" that run the length of the car between the wheels.  Is
this an aftermarket piece, or a nifty thing porsche
incorporated in the design?  There are also some 3M rock
gaurd decal things on it in front of the rear wheels,
which I know were put on there by a previous owner.

The engine itself is in pretty good shape.  The car also
seems to run very good.  The only thing I could notice was
valve noise (I'm not sure how much a Porsche 2.5l I4
should have) and the timing seemed like it might be a
little off, because it would be a little jerky when
decelerating.

It's had a new thermostat put in back in October of last
year.  The timing belts where changed along with the
clutch and tires in early 1996.  The car has spent the
greater span of it's life in California.

So, now on to my questions.

1.)  What's the deal with the hatch and the window?  I
know there is a set screw for the hatch where it catches. 
Could this be my problem?  Would the window more likely be
the switch or the motor itself?

2.)  Is that valve noise normal?  Overall the car is
fairly quiet, and when reved up can get almost as loud
(but not quite) as my Chevy 350.

3.)  Are the seals around the car a pain to change and is
it a huge deal?

4.)  How long could I expect this sucker to run, and how
much do you think I'd have to throw in it right of the bat
to get it to where it should be?  I want it to last a
while, and have heard that these Porsche engines can hold
their own for quite some time.

5.)  How much should I shell out for this thing?  What
should a Porsche in this shape cost me to buy?  (It's
being sold by a private party.)

I thank whoever take the time to answer my questions
imensely.
