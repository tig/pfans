Derek,Randall:

I noticed that everybody who has responded has done chips at the same
time...is it the chip or the MAF??? 

I can understand better throttle reponse and driveability, i just can't see
that the slight difference in intake restriction is going to make any
difference in HP when on boost. I am willing to wager(a small amount) that
a dyno check of a MAF with no chip would should no gain in HP. Seems that
you could spend half the money and get a lot more HP by removing
restrictions in the exhaust system. The HP gain would come even without a
chip...

 Also the tradional AF sensors do go bad.. are you guys comparing "worn
out" OE parts to a new MAF?? 

Hope i am not beating a dead horse... seemed  like it was worth more
discussion.
