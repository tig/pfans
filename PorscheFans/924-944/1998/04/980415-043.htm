Ack,

When things go wrong, they really go wrong!  Upon re-torquing the cylinder
head on the new head gasket, one nut would not take torque.  Upon disassembly,
two head studs pulled clean out of the block with the threads completely
cleaned out of the block!

I'm not sure how this could happen.  You would think that normally, if
something were going to go, the head stud would snap and would need to
be extracted, but in this case, I guess the aluminum block is too soft
for that safety feature.

Oh well, the damn thing is going to sit in the shop for another 2-3 weeks
now while this is rectified.

The shop has a call into Andial to see what the recommended fix is for
this.  Any comments on what you would do in this situation?  I'm thinking
new block, but am open to your opinions.  If a new block is the only way
to fix this properly, then I think popping in a stroker with K27 is really
the only way to fly.
