<< Looking for recommendations on which chip to use for this car and do I need
 fuel enrichment for the "stage 1 or stage 2" chips which claim power
 increased to 250-275 hp?
 
 Rising rate fuel pressure regulators?
 Wastegate modifications? or just chip.
 
 Car is Bone stock and in excellent conditions inside and out

There's many chip options out there, and they all work.  I haven't driven any
other 951s since buying mine, so I can't give a comparative analysis.  Drilled
cycling valve w/ chips seems to be the best performance setup, but I think you
loose your computers ability to limit the boost.  I like this feature.  I did
about 30 minutes on the track with line from the turbo/intercooler tube to the
cycling vavle severed.  It looked like it just blew apart.  I noticed during
my 1st run that I was getting a bit over 16psi of boost (normally peaks at
15psi) on the back straight. During the second run I was only getting about 12
psi.   As the line started leaking, it was like using a bleeder valve to
increase my boost.  When the line broke, it was like going for unlimited
boost, and the computer shut it down, else it would have been head gasket city
