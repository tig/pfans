Well, I cannot remember if I mentioned anything about the fan working only
on setting 4 in my message (the question appeared twice on the list).  If
I did not, here is an ooooold message that Kevin G posted 3 yrs ago (or
so).  Since this is a "standard feature" for the 944 (and some 928's),
many list members may find this useful.

Agree with George's diagnosis.  You sometimes fix what you have by
cleaning the contacts on the resistor block's internal circuit breakers.
They open when the unit gets too hot, which happens when the resistors
start to fall apart and lose thermal contact with their cores.
 
To clean the contacts, remove the resistor block and shoot the breakers
with a cleaner such as Wurth Contact OL.
 
If you need a new one, get it from George.  List on the part from Porsche
is obscene, like $180.  It's almost as expensive even to shops through the
wholesale aftermarket.  And, no, it's not repairable.
