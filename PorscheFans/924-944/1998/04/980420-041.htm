Mike, I had to pull the manifold to replace the cycling valve on my car.  How did you get all those hose clamps off with the manifold in place?  And the little bolts that hold on the valve?  The R&R on the manifold only takes about 30 minutes anyway (I have done it about five times now for various jobs).  If you are replacing the valve, it's a great time to also replace those rubber hoses under the manifold.  The dealership will not (at least in my case) sell the rubber hoses individually, but you can replace them with fuel injection hose.  The dealership will sell you the valve/wastegate hose though.
