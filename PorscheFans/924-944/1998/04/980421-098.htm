Everyone,

I am so frustrated!!!!!!!!!!!!!

For the 3rd time in the past 6 months, I have tried to correctly install 
a front crankshaft seal on my 84 NA 944, and it has constantly leaked!  
Even when I used dino oil, it still leaked.

Today, I finished installing the third one, and I had drive about 2.5 
miles, stopped for gas, and the car has a puddle of oil underneath it 
about 6 inches in diameter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Bummer!!!!!   I nurse it back 
to the house, and oil is all over the undercarriage.  (Did I mention 
that I had just cleaned the underside of the car?)  Anyway, what did I 
do wrong?  It took me 2 hours or so to remove the key so I could install 
this seal without stretching it over the washer that is in front of the 
crank.  I would appreciate responses from Mr. Istook and Mr. Beuslick 
specifically, along with anyone else that has had the problem or knows 
of an answer.

On another subject, how many spacers are there for the rear wheel 
bearings?  I thought there was only one, but it seems that I am having 
to replace the rear wheel bearings again (last time was 3 months ago) 
....I have detected a roar from the passenger side of the car.  Does the 
stub axle strech or deform as time passes?

Thanks for the help!


Michael
