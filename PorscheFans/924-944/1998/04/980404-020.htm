Once again, I thank everyone who e-mailed me back about my 
overheating problem. This group is wonderfull ! And yes, I needed
to add coolant into the bleeder valve. That brought the temperature
level down. I wasted the past three days installing a new thermostat.

Should the front or rear of the car be jacked up during bleeding of the 
coolant system? I've been told both of these is the way.

So what should an '86 944 n/a indicate for normal temperature?
The needle now will only go slightly above the horizontal. Do I still
have room for improvement?

Plus, only 1 of my cooling fans comes on. The fuses are OK. Does
this sound like a temperature switch?

Finally, my heater acts strange. It will put out heat as I drive, but when
the car idles, it blows cold air. Is this related to my engine temp
problem?

I"ve only had this car for a week, so I'm in the dark about alot of it.

Thanks so much,  Rob
.
