Hi all,

As another summer approaches, and grad school affords some
respite, I emerge back out of lurk-only-mode to say Hi to all,
....  esp. my old friends here.

My 924 always used to loose some coolant, esp. if driven with
high revs for extended periods of time. Inspired by a suggestion
by Kevin Gross (Hey Kevin, howdy :) from a different context I
stuck a coke bottle to the overflow pipe. The amount of coolant
loss through the overflow is consistently equal to the amount
that is replenished each time.

The pressure relief cap on the coolant reservoir is not the OEM
make, and is rated at 16lb pressure. I suspect that it is
probably rated wrong. I can get caps rated all the way to 20lb
at PEP boys. They even have a '82 VW Golf/Rabbit OEM part that
is rated at 20lb.

What is the correct rated coolant cap pressure for a '82 924
normally aspirated ?

TIA ...
