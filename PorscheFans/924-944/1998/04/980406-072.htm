	I'm a new '77 924 owner who finds myself in the unfortunate position of
owning a dream car which I have decided, after not much more than a brief
test drive and cursory inspection not to drive. Atleast not for the moment
or apparently in the forseeable future. In its current state it would be
unsafe at any speed. Therefore a complete restoration is in order.
	I bought the car based on its sound structure. No rust to speak of and no
apparent body repair. The interior is in surprisingly good shape for the
car's age. This is where the "soundness" ends. Virtually all mechanical and
electrical systems are in need of major repair. I was able to purchase a
Chilton manual which covers this year and model but after having read
through it I realize it will only be useful for the most basic guidance. I
turn now to the list. I've been lurking this list for the past few weeks
and have found few references to the old 924's. Searching the archives as
time allows has produced very few hits as well. Therefore I'm left with no
option but to start consuming bandwidth in my quest for knowledge and
advice concerning my older Porsche project.
	I'll start with the heater control (of particular concern to me being
located in the great white north) which has three separate control arms.
Replacement cost from the dealer was quoted at $429.00 Cdn. before taxes.
Ouch! I was motivated to fix the problem with it myself. Simple enough. Now
the top slider consists of a copper contact in the control arm which slides
across a copper coated circuit board thereby activating the dual speeds of
the heater motor. There was a small amount of what appeared to be grease
mixed with a large amount of what was definitely dirt coating the contact
area between the circuit board and the copper contact in the control arm.
Presumably to limit wear of the copper on the circuit board. As this
control will experience a large amount of use in the future I'd like to
re-lube it prior to assembly. Can anyone speculate or suggest what type of
lube I should use in this area? I assume it needs to be conductive but
beyond that have no idea what would work best. TIA
