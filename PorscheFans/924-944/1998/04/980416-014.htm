Greetings,

My '86 951 is in the body shop due to my recent close encounter with 
a deer, and a puzzler has emerged.  When I bought the car last Oct., 
there was a sticker in the driver's side rear window that said 
'Porsche Alarm'.  Below that, there is a key hole in the body, to the 
right of the door key hole.  Now, I always thought that this was the 
'factory alarm'.  The PO didn't have a key for it, never used it.  
The boys in the shop discovered that all the wires to the back of it 
have been cut.  Okay, no alarm.  But, when they tried to move it 
without (I guess) using the key to first unlock it, the horn started 
tooting.  They were going to drive it over to another space in the 
shop, but it wouldn't start (alarm disconnect?).  So, it appears 
there is a 'factory alarm?', but it is not aassociated with the key 
on the side panel?  Does the door key automatically alarm and disarm 
this function?  None of this is a real problem, just very curious, so 
if any of you wise folk have some experience with this, I'd be 
grateful for some answers.

TIA
Jim Crow
