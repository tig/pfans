P-fans,
In my quest to hook up the new boost gauge and line, I took the banjo bolt
that the KLR line hooks up to out of the manifold. I took the bolt, along with
the compression fitting that came with the boost gauge kit, down to a  machine
shop (not an automotive machine shop). The type of shop that can make almost
anything. I asked them if they could drill a hole through the head of the bolt
and attach the compression fitting there. They are going to weld a piece of
metal to the head of the bolt and cut threads for the compression fitting.
When finished, it should look stock and I won't have to worry about tapping
into the manifold or it leaking.I will get the bolt back next Wednesday and
will let you know how it worked out.
Have a good day!
