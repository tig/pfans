Just got back from the shop.  Since I'm dumping all this money into the 
951, and considering that a clutch will likely be needed soon, I feel
that I should check out some of the other p-car offerings to make sure
that I want my earnings to go to the 951 cause.

I test drove a very nice black 993 going for C$68,000 or so.  Damn nice car
for the money, but man is that car slow!  It's not that it was slow overall,
but slow when you needed it to be fast.  Like, you are travelling behind
a slow moving vehicle at 3000rpm in 3rd gear and you want to pass it,
but the left lane has a fast emerging BMW or whatever.  You floor it,
and change lanes, but there is no power at 3000rpm.  Once the tach swings
past 5000rpm, things change, but at that point, you are going too fast and
you need to slow down or you'll rear end someone.

In my Turbo, you just floor it, wait about two seconds, then change lanes
and immediately lift or you'll rear end someone.  I always like to judge
a car by how much it scares me.  I get the feeling of being scared by
judging how far I have to look ahead to be comfortable.  In my Turbo,
I have to look at least 1 block ahead because when the boost comes on,
there is not really enough time to react to slow down in time if something
pops out.  The 993 felt like I could drive flat out everywhere and stare
at the bumber of the car in front of me :)

The chassis is wonderful in the 993 though and the switches, etc. are much
better than the 89 Carrera I had for a while.  FOr fun factor, I'd take
the 89 Carrera over this 95 993.  Refinement, hands down, the 993.  Power,
still the old 944T for me.

I've told my shop to find me a 91 911 Turbo in Red.  If they find the right
car, I'll likely grab it.  It's either my 944T or a 911 Turbo, nothing else
has the same feel.  Once you've had a boost gauge in front of your nose,
it's like a drug, you can't stop sniffing it :)

We priced out some short blocks, bare blocks and used motors today.
A factory short block is C$6995, a used Turbo S motor complete is
C$4500 and we still haven't found a new or refurbished(?) bare block.
If you are stopping by Milledge's or Kelly Moss or Andial or any of
the reputable places, see if they have a good bare block they want
to sell to a little guy in Canada :)
