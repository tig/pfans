Hello Clemons

DOT-3 & DOT-4 are fully compatable! The shop that you talked to doesn=92t=
 know=0Awhat they are talking about. I would stay - far away from that sh=
op! Sounds=0Alike a bunch of untrained grease monkeys!!!  Hey no flames p=
lease, I have=0Aseveral grease monkeys as best friends and enjoy working =
on my car as well! 
And lots of grease under my finger nails too to prove it!!!

DOT-5  - silicone is not compatable with DOT-3 or DOT-4!!! Stay away from=
 the=0Astuff! 

I would use ATE super Blue (DOT-4+) or Ford HD brake fluid or any of the =
rec=0Aracing stuff...

Most shops should charge one hour of labor to flush and bleed the brake s=
ystem=0A(not including the clutch hydro sys) if you do not like doing it =
yourself. 

Or, you could install a set of replacement bled screws with a small check=
=0Avalve built in. I believe a couple of P-Fans are using this system.

Or you could just crack all the bled screws (after replacing the fluid in=
 the=0Aresivior) and let the car sit over night with the bled screws open=
, ala=0Agravity bled. 

Good Luck
