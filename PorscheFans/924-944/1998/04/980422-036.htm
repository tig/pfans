As I Remember 'tug' doesn't quite describe it. Beating the piss out of it
was closer. I actually called the famous George B. because I thought I must
be doing damage. He verified that it needs quite a bit of persuasion to
remove the shaft. My solution was to use a set of visegrips on the M8 bolt
and then wack the visegrips (old set) until it came out. The longer the M*
bolt the more room you will have to work.
