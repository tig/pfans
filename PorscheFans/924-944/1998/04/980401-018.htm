Well, after fixing the flap, I still get no heat in my 85.5 944.  Of
course, I shold have known from the start it had nothing to do with the
flap, because while it was broken, it was resting in the wide-open state,
so I should have been feeling all the heat I'd ever want.  

What's the suspect?  Would it be the heater valve?  How do I check (and
where is it located?)?  Thanks in advance,

Matthew

Bleeding the clutch after replacing the master and slave cylinder was a   
major headache.  I could never get the air completely out of the system.   
 The big problem I had was that the clutch hose connection on the   
resevoir is high up on the resevoir (brake safety i guess). With the   
front of the car jacked up it is very difficult to keep fluid over the   
resevoir exit.  I made an auxiliary resevoir out of a very clean dry   
plastic coke bottle, put a quart of fluid in it and attached it to the   
line going to the clutch master cylinder.  I then made a little device   
(two hoses and a pickle jar) to evacuate the air from the line and suck   
down the brake fluid to the slave.  After that (and with help from a   
friend) a few pumps of the clutch to bleed the system and it was solid.
Put the hose back on the resevoir and you are done.  The clutch has felt   
great ever since.
