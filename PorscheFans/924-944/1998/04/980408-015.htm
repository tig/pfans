Hello Richard,

A common mistake. Note that on some cars (like mine) even if you
remove both sensors, you still have to remove the sensor mounting
block. The block has a sleeve that extends down into the bellhousing.
It's a real joy to remove and install the mounting block (NOT).

I bet it's fine. I think these things are really just magnets inside
a metal can. As long as it's not cracked, it's probably fine. The
real way to tell is after everything is put back together, does the
car run? If it starts, the sensor is fine. If it doesn't, it's
broken. 

Note that when you reinstall the sensor mounting block, you have to
set the height. One of the bolt holes is elongated. You rotate the
mounting block to set the height. If the sensor is too low, the
pin in the flywheel will hit it and eventually brake it (don't ask
me how I know).
