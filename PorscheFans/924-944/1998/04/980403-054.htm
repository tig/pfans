I have been told by the local dealer that the creaking and moaning =
coming from the right front strut tower is partially (mostly) caused by =
a bad lower control arm.  In fact, they say both are shot.  I just =
rolled past 100K miles tonight and need some A-Arm advice.

I don't track the car but I drive it hard on the windy roads in the GA =
mountains whenever possible.  Should I go for the Zims rebuilt model, =
the amazingly affordable - not - fabcar parts, or the OE stuff new from =
the dealer.  I really don't want to re-eningeer something so adding ball =
joints via some modification to my existing arms is out of the question. =
 Also, this does not look like that tough a job.  Unlike many cars where =
the lower part of the spring is retained by the control arm there =
appears to be no pressure on the Porsche unit.  Is this correct?  Is it =
really as simple as unbolting the old one, installing the new one, and =
getting an alignment?

Thanks!
