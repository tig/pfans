A method I used was to carefully separate the foam from the leather around the
tear and insert a piece of leather or vinyl into the seat that is a little
larger than the tear. Then I smeared black RTV in between the vinyl and the
leather, put a piece of saran wrap over the repair, and a weight on top of
that. After letting the whole mess dry it worked out pretty good and doesn't
look too bad. It's held up really well (now rest of the seat is falling
apart).
