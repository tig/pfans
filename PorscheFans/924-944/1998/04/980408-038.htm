I read the book on the way to my Saturday kart race.  I was going to make
a post about it.  The first few chapters are pretty much worthless for 
p-fans.  Everything in the first bit has already been discussed on this
list with the same terms, etc.  The last half is a bit more interesting,
but nothing Earth shattering.  I was a bit dissapointed at how generic
some sections were and satisfied with the technical aspects of others.

When you talk about books, it's hard to understand what the person likes.
So, to give a reference, I loved Fred Puhn's "How to make your car handle".
I would not purchase the Corky Bell book unless you know nothing about
turbos, especially for US$35.  It's the kind of book you read at your
tuner's shop while waiting for your car to be serviced.

On a slightly sad note, my little "Babe" seems to have a leaking head
gasket.  I've been losing a little coolant every day for a while now
and have had little success in tracking down where it was going (like
a few ounces a day).  Recently, the car has been missing on startup,
then clears after about 30 seconds.  After consulting some of the 
experts on the list, a quick diagnosis was the head gasket.  I got
the shop to do all the usual tests, but nothing came up.  Still not
really satisfied, I spent a bit more time monitoring the car's activities
after startup and noticed that after the startup "missing", right before
the motor would clear, the exhaust would let out a really sweet smell.

I had noticed the smell before when pulling out of a parking spot, but
never realized it was coming from the exhaust.  Spark plug 1 also looks
a bit different then the others, so I'm speculating that the gasket is
leaking into #1 overnight as the pressure in the cooling system is higher
than the cylinder and when I fire it up, the plug is trying to burn the
water/air/fuel mixture and has trouble until it burns it all off, then
it runs as normal.  Funny thing is that the cooling system is not
being pressurized by the combustion chamber under boost or anything like
that and the oil and coolant look fine.

Since I have warranty, I thought I might as well take it in and have it
replaced.  One thing I've noticed is that my maintenance has gone up
dramatically with short driving cycles.
