>Hello everyone, this week has been rough. Just when I thought everything
that
could be replaced had, the rear end of my 87 944s gets a mind of its own. At
the beginning of the week I began to hear the tell tale signs of cv joint
failure. A distinct clicking . Well considering it had been about 45000
miles
since they had been checked or repacked (the PO states) I figured I would
just
replace the half shafts. I found a great price on the parts $150 each w/ new
cv's. Since it is not exactly a difficult job a friend and I completed the
task. We got everything back together and it the noise was gone. Then after
about 10 miles, a horribly loud knocking began to erupt from the rear end
(differential area)
My question is, what could replacing half shafts do to the transmission or
differential? The noise is so loud you can feel it, but sometimes it is
there,
sometimes it is gone. Needless to say the car was flat bedded home where it
currently sits.
PLEASE give me some help.

Did you check the obvious? - CV joint bolts backing out? It is a fairly
common occurrence after they have been reinstalled. There was an old thread
on the list about it.
If thats not it can you describe the sound a bit better?
