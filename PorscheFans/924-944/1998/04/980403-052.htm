Dear Gurus:
I have a 1978 924 project that will not start.  The car was running well (I
guess, I'm new to the Porsche experience) and all of a sudden began to quit
running well at low speeds and eventually quit starting altogether.  I'm
getting fuel and the injectors produce a good spray.  I'm getting spark and
the timing is perfect in terms of adjusting the ignition to top dead center
with a "cold timing job".  In looking at the Haynes manual in the ignition
section, I read that wet plugs with an oily appearance are a good indicator of
worn valve guides and/or bad rings.  When I measured the compression several
months ago all four cylinders were about 115-125 lbs/psi.  I don't think the
rings are bad therefore.  Does it sound like worn valve guides to you guys.  I
can tell you that when I drained the oil after my first repairs, it smelled
like gasoline, like maybe there was something worn that was allowing gas into
the crankcase.  Is the only way to proceed to pull the head?  If so should I
just leave the camshaft attached and take the whole assembly to an experienced
mechanic?  Is this out of the league of a shade tree mechanic?  I would really
appreciate your input. 

Thanks,
Robert Allen
