Jim,

Umm, the purpose of anti seize, or any similar type of lubricant, is not
to allow an item to over torque after installed nor to move freely or
loosen on their own.  Once the studs are installed and tightened down,
they should hold that amount of torque and strech as you described.  But
if they are to ever be removed, they will untorque without removing the
threades as described.  The anti seize doesn't cause the inability of a
threaded part to become tight and stationary, it just keeps the two
metals in contact from bonding themselves together.  I realize you are
saying that Porsche never intended the studs to be removed, and in that
way of thinking the locktite is the answer, but here is a prime example
of what happens when things don't always go as expected or planned.

Just my thoughts,
Gary

>Could this be a case of not using anti-seize during original/last

anti-seize.  I think the outcome was that 80lbs of torque was more than
80lbs when using an anti-seize compound.  I have never taken the head

of mine but need to soon and would be interested on the ruling of
anti-seize on head studs.

Mark,

The head studs come Locktited in with the gonzo stuff from the factory.

Don't consider using anti-sieze on the block end of the head studs.  The

alloy head studs actually stretch to a degree which lets the engine
designers use smaller diameter studs to produce a given torque.  The
stretched elastic stud is like a rubber band, it pulls to return to its
original state.  When torquing the head, you want the stud threads in
the=

soft aluminum block anchored not turning.  This leaves the friction for
t=
he
stronger steel nuts and studs.   Save the anti sieze for your lug nuts.
