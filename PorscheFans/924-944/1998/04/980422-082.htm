My PO put a new clutch in at around 95k miles.  When I recently checked it at
about 145k miles I had about 80% clutch thickness remaining.  I started taking
drivers ed shortly after I bought the car, and I believe that learning to
toe/heel quickly, learning to allow the clutch to engage before getting back
into the throttle (From the time I bought the car to my first DE, I was
begining to develop a habit of power-shifting into second), and not to launch
the car off the line (calm down, part throttle until you're up to about 3k on
the tac, and pull the trigger!) are the reasons I have so much clutch left.

 eaten a clutch. My car, purchased with 77k on it, had the clutch replaced
 at 52k and my buddy Gary needed a new clutch at 49k. What is the expected
 longevity on a 951 clutch? I presume that some people use their clutch
 harder than others. If you email me your clutch longevity, I'll compile the
 stats.  Please include city/highway estimate. >>
