     Jim,
     
     I just replace both mounts last weekend.  It took 2-1/2 hours but it 
     was the second time I have replaced them.  In my experience they last 
     only 30-50k miles.  The left (exhaust side) mount goes first because 
     of the heat from the exhaust.  However, there is very little 
     additional effort required to replace both at the same time.  
     Furthermore, the mounts now cost about half what they did several 
     years ago.  This is a PM which will reward you by eliminating all that 
     vibration you feel through the steering wheel at low RPM's.
     
     Yes, the new ones appear thicker.  That is because the old ones are 
     squashed down from use.
     
     Parts to remove:  front wheels, front sway bar, power steering line 
     clamp where it is attached to the lower frame rail, cross member (all 
     four bolts).  I have not found it necessary to disconnect any of the 
     steering linkages.  The mounts themselves are a pain to unbolt as the 
     lower nuts can only be turned about 1/12 turn at a time and they are 
     locking nuts so they need to be wrenched all the way (these nuts 
     should be replaced by the way).
     
     Use a piece of 2x4 under the oil pan when jacking the engine.  I then 
     use pry bars and wedges to pull the cross member down for sufficient 
     clearance to maneuver the mounts out and in.  Note the orientation of 
     the old mounts.  There is a wide lip which gets pushed into a recess 
     on the outboard side on installation.  Use anti-sieze on the two upper 
     bolts on each mount.
