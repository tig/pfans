Thanks to everyone who responded to my previous questions.  Your responses were 
quite helpful.  A few new questions have popped up regarding my '92 968.

1.  I have noticed over the last few months that the power seems to lag a 
little bit behind the throttle.  For example, if I floor it, my tach will rev 
up, but I won't feel the car accelerate immediately (it lags behind a second or 
two).  Has anyone ever experienced anything like this???

2.  My clutch seems to be sticking when I push it all the way down.  At the 
very bottom of the floor, it seems to stick and then it will pull free.  
Otherwise, the feel of the clutch seems to be OK.  Is there something wrong 
with the clutch or does the pedal need to be lubricated at all???

3.  I noticed a small chip on my windshield.  Does anyone have any experience 
in repairing these sort of things??  Does it cost very much??  Is it noticable 
afterwards??

4.  On the same note, I'm beginning to notice a lot of scratches on my 
windshield.  I heard that it is possible to remove these scratches my rubbing 
my windshield with a very fine steel wool and some window cleaner.  Has anyone 
ever tried this or is there a better way to do this???

Any help is greatly appreciated.  Thanks,

Alex
