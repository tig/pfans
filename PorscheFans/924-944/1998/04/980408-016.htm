Yes, that is what the aluminum strips are about. Cut 2 strips about 2" long
and about 1/2 " wide and place them under the rear pads (one for each
wheel). The easiest way to do this is to remove the pads, put the aluminum
shims in and the put the pads on top of them. 

This problem seems to be at its worst when using MetalMaster pads. If you
try a different brand of street pad you may not have the problem.
