Sounds like a load to me. First, it is unaccpetable to bend trailing arms
to correct suspension damage. Second, bending anything back there to correct
2" of toe will mean that your spring plates are bent (or will be after the
mayhem), also a no-no. Are you sure they don't mean something like 2 degrees
of toe?

Not sure but about as much toe adjustment as there is camber adjustment. I think
that would mean about +/- 1/2" on each side based on what I have seen on my car.
Maybe more or less depending on car-to-car variations.

I recently replaced two with fairly new spindles and bearings for about $400
total.

Prices ranged from around $100 each (no history, no idea how old the bearings
were) to around $400 each (new spindles and bearings with history). Shop around.

You need to find what is bent. If the arm(s) are bent they are trash and you are
waiting for an accident to happen. If the spring plate(s) are bent they need to
be replaced. I would be seriously suspect of any shop suggesting to straighten
bent (or even bend factory-straight) suspension components to achieve the proper
alignment specs.

Good luck with it,
