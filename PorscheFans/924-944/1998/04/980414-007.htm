Jad the supplementary air valve as it is called in the (clear as mud) above
manual is drawn on page 204 and is shown supplied from fuse 2 (16 amp) on
the additional fuse board which also supplies the fuel pump.
As the car runs the fuse should be OK .You could hot-wire it from an
ignition live circuit, BUT this would be a bad idea because if the problem
is at the fuse board (loose or corroded connection etc) the next thing to
fail may be your fuel pump (very nasty).The wiring runs from the fuse to
the connector plug in the engine bay to the plug on the air valve itself so
shouldn't be too difficult to trace.
Good luck
Martin
