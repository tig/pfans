Hello Pfans, earlier last week I spoke of my water pump failed and is
leaving puddles everywhere I go. My question is I had all the belts and
seals done on the engine from top to bottom recently.  Wouldn't it be
safe to assume that my mechanic would have offered to change the pump
when these others repairs were done. My 951 had 135k plus when I did the
reseal job and the belts etc. was done around the same time. Normally I
here of folks doing the pump and belts at the same time. I am concerned
now because the amount of labor it will take to tear everthing down
again. Also is this a fairly easy job to do on ones own?
