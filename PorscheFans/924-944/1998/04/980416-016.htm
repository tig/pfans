> Hello Everyone, Once again I have a question that I can't seem to find
the
> answer to in may Hanes manual. In the May issue of Excellence magazine,
Jim
> Pasha wrote an article called suspension basics part 2, in this article
it
> states that bringing down the rear of a 924/944 so that the door sills
are
> level is the most cost effective thing that you can do to for the
handling.
> I have an appointment for a four wheel alignment, this is something that
is
> needed already. I would like to lower the back end before I bring it in
for
> the alignment so I only have to do it once. Does anyone know how to do
this
> or should I have the alignment shop do this for me? I am having the
> alignment done at a local shop, not a Porsche dealer. In the article it
> states that there is a eccentric in the rear trailing blade, what is the
> rear trailing blade? I haven't looked under the car yet, so if this is
> something that is very obvious this is why. If anyone has done this
before,
> or knows how please let me know my appointment for the alignment is in
two
> days. Thanks in advance!
