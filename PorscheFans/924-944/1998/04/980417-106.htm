Umm, the purpose of anti seize, or any similar type of lubricant, is not
to allow an item to over torque after installed nor to move freely or
loosen on their own.  Once the studs are installed and tightened down,
they should hold that amount of torque and strech as you described.  But
if they are to ever be removed, they will untorque without removing the
threades as described.  The anti seize doesn't cause the inability of a
threaded part to become tight and stationary, it just keeps the two
metals in contact from bonding themselves together.  I realize you are
saying that Porsche never intended the studs to be removed, and in that
way of thinking the locktite is the answer, but here is a prime example
of what happens when things don't always go as expected or planned.

Gary,

I agree with you about anti-sieze, I just said not to use it on the block=

end of the head studs.  I can find out the technical reasons from my engi=
ne
builder but aluminum blocks have Locktited in head studs rather than head=

bolts for a reason.  It is my recollection that the steel threads put und=
ue
stress on the aluminum threads during the torqueing process and I do not
think anti-sieze solves the problem.

I use anti-sieze compound whenever there is a question about having to
diassemble a part in the future.

Jim
