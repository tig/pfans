Subject: April Showers :-(

Hi all,
Just got my first ever Porsche :-)  Its a bright yellow 924.  It does
however have a couple of small things that I need to sort out.  The most
pressing thing is the sun(?)roof.  It is a large lift out one with two
eccentric clamps at the rear to secure it in place.  The problem is... it
leaks!  There is no rubber seal on either the roof or the lift out section.
I called my local Porsche dealer and they quoted me GBP75 +vat for the
rubber seal.  My question is, does anyone know of another way to seal the
roof (as many of my other problems have been sorted by getting parts for
other cars that also fit, e.g, XR3i fuel injection parts).  Or is anyone
breaking a 924 with a roof of this type that I could buy (either the section
or just the seal).
Love 'n' kisses
Esther
