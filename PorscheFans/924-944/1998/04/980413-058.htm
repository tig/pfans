Hi all,

My 85.5 944 has a severe oil leak in the front of the engine.  I replaced
the cam shaft seal, then drove it 300 miles only to find it leaking just
as much as before.  Pulled the camshaft sprocket tonight but found that
seal to be dry.  There is fresh oil all over the inside of the plastic 
belt covers but it seems to be the greatest coming down from the upper
balance shaft.  Could also be some from the lower balance shaft.  Don't 
think that the crankshaft seal is leaking but it's hard to tell.

I intend to replace both balance shaft seals but have a question: How do 
I loosen the balance shaft sprocket nuts?  I have to hold the darn things
still somehow to resist the torque loosening the nuts.  It seems like a
lot to ask of the balance shaft belt to resist this, so what do I do?

Thanks,
Greg Laws   laws03@hit.net
