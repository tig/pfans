Help!
Briefly, the car was running just fine last Saturday - went for a 
pleasant 30 mile run in the countryside before starting on some brake 
pipe replacements for the annual test (minor surface rust gets a 
fail.) The car stayed on the stands until Tuesday night awaiting new 
flexible pipes and a bleed.  After the above work, I tried to start 
the engine, and....
1) the starter turns the engine, but "baulks", i.e. spins part of a 
turn then stops.  The engine is torquing like mad on its mounts.
2) after checking the timing belt, basic ignition timing, plugs etc, 
tried again, same story, but with repeated tries it eventually spun 
enough to fire up, but engine runs like only 2 or 3 cylinders firing, 
then stalls after a few seconds - won't idle.
Since I recently changed the clutch I checked the flywheel wasn't 
rattling around or anything like that, but looks fine (remember it 
drove into the garage just fine.)
My main suspect now is the starter motor, but I don't have much 
experience with pre-engaged starters... can anyone advise how to 
check the starter off the car?...or does anyone have any other 
ideas??
I've also just had the fuel tank out for repair and put it back, but 
again, if it was crappy fuel, it surely wouldn't happen just like 
that, between one start and the next?
TIA
