Subject: Mass Air Flow vs Exhaust

Derek,Randall:

I noticed that everybody who has responded has done chips at the same
time...is it the chip or the MAF??? 

I can understand better throttle reponse and driveability, i just
can't see that the slight difference in intake restriction is going to
make any difference in HP when on boost. I am willing to wager(a small
amount) that a dyno check of a MAF with no chip would should no gain
in HP. Seems that you could spend half the money and get a lot more HP
by removing restrictions in the exhaust system. The HP gain would come
even without a chip...

 Also the tradional AF sensors do go bad.. are you guys comparing
"worn out" OE parts to a new MAF?? 

Hope i am not beating a dead horse... seemed  like it was worth more
discussion.

================================================

Peter:

I do not think you are beating a dead horse whatsoever; this is an
expensive upgrade and certainly worthy of further discussion!

As respects your question on whether it's the chips or the MAF, I
think that the custom-mapped chips that come with the MAF help to
MAXIMIZE the inherent advantages of the "hot wire" system. 
Specifically, better flow = more power.  I know that seems like a
blanket statement, but it is almost always true.  Nearly any car,
whether NA or turbocharged, will benefit from increases in intake flow
as well as exhaust flow (as you mentioned).  I think that a car that
has the MAF w/out chips would probably not realize much of an increase
as you stated.

In terms of exhaust, the 951 needs to have a certain amount of
backpressure in order to maintain low-end torque (there was a recent
post about this, anyone have it?).  Case in point:  A Porsche "tuner"
told me not to waste my time buying an entire SS exhaust system and
instead cut off my muffler to reduce backpressure.  Took his advice,
took the car out for a spin and noticed a significant decrease in
low-end torque (in addition to a shi_ _ y exhaust note).  Needless to
say, the stock muffler went back on in a hurry!  Keep in mind that I
also had the cat previously gutted so my backpressure was already less
than a stock car.  I do realize that less backpressure can reduce
turbo lag but again, only up to a point.

In terms of a wornout AF sensor v. the MAF, I have no idea what kind
of shape mine was in so I decline to comment.

One final note on the flow characteristics of our cars (as Randall can
attest):  Extrude Honing your head/intake manifold and match-porting. 
Again, better flow = more power (37hp dyno'd increase per Powerhaus).

Let me know what you think...
