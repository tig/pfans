Hi all,

	It seems that the alloy that is used for the 944 block may have a low
shear strength.  I have had two fasteners remove the threads from their
respective holes.  One was a water pump bolt, the other was a bolt for the
speed/position sensors.  Neither of these holes were blind, and I was able
to heli-coil both of them easily.
	I am a mechanical engineer and  have a limited knowledge of materials and
fasteners, so I will throw my two cents into the rapidly growing pile.  In
my opinion the block was not able to support the shear load imposed on it
by the head stud.  I would be interested to see the material properties for
the alloy used for the block.  Perhaps the Porsche engineers traded low
density and high stiffness for lower shear properties with the particular
alloy they chose.
	 Fastener science is more involved than one would think.   Most of the
bolts in our engines are used in tension to generate a certain clamping
force.  In the case of an engine head, the engineer will calculate the
clamping force needed to hold the head to the engine.  The size, number and
position of the head bolts/studs needed to produce and evenly distribute
this clamping force will be determined from this.  Now comes the part of
great debate.... torquing the fasteners.  As already stated in many posts
to this list, the fasteners need to stretch.  To provide the proper
clamping force, the bolt must be elastically deformed  a calculated
amount.  Ideally every bolt would come with its own strain (deformation)
gage, allowing one to directly measure the deformation.  This would enable
us to torque away until the proper stretch is obtained.  If this were the
case it would not matter if the threads were lubricated or not.  In the
real world bolt tension is not measured.  The torque value that is used is
a number that has been empirically determined to provide the proper bolt
tension.  These torque values are generated using dry or perhaps oiled
threads.  The torque value to reach a specific tension in a bolt will
differ from dry to lubricated threads.  It would be interesting to see the
data regarding torque necessary to achieve proper bolt tension as material
and lubrication are changed.
	Maybe a finer thread should have been used for the head studs.  The finer
thread would transfer the load to the block more efficiently.   The threads
in the block are not as strong as the threads on the fastener due to fact
that they are cut not rolled.  On a side note... the studs neck down to
provide for optimal stress distribution under load.
	I would suggest that anyone interested to find out about fasteners should
look at Carol Smith's "Engineer to Win" and "The Nuts Bolts and Fasteners
Handbook".  A basic strength of materials book would also be helpful.
Carol Smith's books discuss tension applications as well as shear
applications.
