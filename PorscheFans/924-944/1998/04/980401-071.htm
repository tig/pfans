I'm back from a plane trip and working again at finding the wiring problem
that fried part of the dme on my 87 924S. I seem to have tracked it down to a
ground problem, one of the ground connections on the connector that hooks on
to the dme is supposed to go to the ground on the engine block. It does not
read continuity to ground. Furthermore, when I crank the engine, that same
connector reads 12 volts. I tried putting some lightweigh fuses across the
blown dme circuit, and it to blows when cranking. I cans see and feel the
connection on the block, it could not be that bad. It is a moderately heavy
brown wire which goes into the harness. The schematic indicates that several
small devices joint together at something called SP4, which I assume is either
a splice inside the harness or a connector located somewhere. Does anyone out
there know where SP4 is located. Note, this is not a ground point, but a
collector for the wire in the harness which then goes to the ground point.
email me directly if you know where this thing is, tia,
