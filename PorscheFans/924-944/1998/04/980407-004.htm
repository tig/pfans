I have a 84 944 that has a problem with the steering wheel shaking at
around 65 mph. I have been told that this is probably due to the wheels
being out of balance, but I noticed that the front tires have a little more
wear on the inside edge, Could this be caused from the tires being out of
balance? Or is this a alignment problem? I also was told (I think anyway)
that there is a special tool that is needed for the alignment of a 944, is
this correct? If so, is this a tool that only a Porsche dealer is going to
have? Or do other cars require this tool also? I called a local place and
asked if they could do an alignment and they said " A Porsche? Yep we can
do a Porsche" without even asking what model it was. If anyone out there
can help it would be much appreciated.

Thanks
