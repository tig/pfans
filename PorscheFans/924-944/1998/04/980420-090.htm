Hello out there,

I've been trying to get this through the list for some time now but it's 
not happening.  Hopefully, this time it will work.
First, I would like to thank all that responded to my question 
concerning  my cruise control switch that chronically clicks.  
However, we all know that once something goes wrong, the whole structure 
falls to pieces.  Now, I'm having some problems with my headlights.  The 
lights work, but they won't come up with a flip of the structure.  I 
disconnected the relay that leads to the headlight motor and fooled 
around with that for a little while and I could detect audibly the 
mechanical clicking of the relay.  I think that I'm trying to avoid the 
possibility that the motor is broken.  One other question.  As long as 
I've had this car, the tachometer has never worked.  However, on my way 
home today, it worked.  Out of nowhere, the tach was working!!!!  It was 
so marvelous.  Just to make sure that my luck was not temporary, I 
turned of the car and restarted it, and sure enough, the thing didn't 
work.  What's going on here?!!!  The same thing happened several months 
ago with my parking brake.  It worked once and never ago.   Well, if any 
of you might know anything about any of my predicaments, please drop me 
a line. Thanks in advance.

Dave
