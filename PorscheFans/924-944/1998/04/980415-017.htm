About 1.5 years ago one of my balance shafts went wrong. The double side

teethed balance shaft belt had become a single side teethed one. The shop

could fix it, but it would take them a week and I needed the car so I

suggested

to take the belt off, so I could drive for some time without the balance

shafts

until the shop had time to fix it in a day or so.

I got a lot of wanted and unwanted advise about driving without the shafts,

ranging

from: "you wont be able to reach maximum revs" to "There will be

unacceptable stress

on the main bearing". When you think about it, none of those hold any

ground.

The ONLY reason for the balance shafts is reduction of vibrations at high

revs.

But, because the engine is very well mounted (using hydraulically damped

motor mounts)

and the engine is already very well balanced from itself, THE RESULT IS

GREAT.

The engine runs lighter, has more power, sounds better and just make the car

more

exciting to drive. The balance shafts should not have been there in the

first place,

it is a sports car, who cares about a few vibrations. It just makes the

engine

heavier and more complex. For anyone having trouble with balance shaft or

belt:

TAKE THE BELT OFF.
