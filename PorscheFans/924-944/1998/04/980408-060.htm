Mark:

Your problem with a leak where the rear window meets the rear frame is =
common.  I have had 2 944's that developed the same problem, apparently =
the rear deck shocks push with such force that eventually the seal =
fails.  I have tried several types of adhesive.  The only one that works =
for any time is to us "Glass Epoxy".  First I remove the rear glass for =
the frame (a pain and heavy, 2 person job!) then clean out the channel =
on the frame, you may need to use a small torch, watch the rubber =
gasket, aluminum foil works well as a shield. Then mix up epoxy.. I use =
BLACK CONAP EASYEPOXY... I get it from GOLFSMITH (yes the golfclub =
company; www.golfsmith.com) for $5.30 a tube (stock number 9155).
I like this epoxy because it is slow to harden... sets in about 2 hours =
and fully cured in 24.  I have not had to re-do any of my repairs... 2 =
years and counting.  One disadvantage is that I don't know how easy it =
would be to take the window from the frame after applying the epoxy, but =
would bet apply heat and it would come loose??!! Good luck!
