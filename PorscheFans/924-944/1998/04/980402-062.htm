I also had a VERY cracked dash in my 83. Called around and got a dash cover
three years ago. Put too much silicone adhesive and the thing warped slightly
but still held up OK. Last year, it started to crack at the end, where it
touches the passenger door.

The cover had a lifetime warranty from COVERLAY, so I called, and they stood
behind their product. Sent me a new one FOB delivered! Noticed there were "new
instructions" with this one, indicating to use adhesive VERY SPARINGLY.

The result is great, and it actually shines beautifully for weeks with just a
little interior cleaner. The texture also matches the original door trim and
parts of the center console. Very pleased with the results, and sure beats an
$800 new dashboard.
