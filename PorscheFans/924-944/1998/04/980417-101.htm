(silly digest)

The head studs for the 944 do not bottom out into the bottom of the stud holes.
 So some form of locktite is necessary to keep them from screwing themselves
into the block further than necessary.  I believe the medium strength is
usually recommended (although Porsche uses high strength, or equivalent).

As for Farzaan's dilema, was there any talk of tapping the head studs to a
larger size and using a larger diameter head stud?  Or you could have them try
to heli-coil it, although I doubt this would work and I'd hate to be the person
turning that little plastic dowl trying to screw the coil in...

Also, Farzaan mentioned going to the 2.8 stroker...if you like lots of pain,
spending great amounts of time deciphering truth from fiction and spending lots
of money trying to do things the right way, go for it.  The way I see it,
building a reliable 2.8 liter motor is like trying to find religion...

Jim,

Umm, the purpose of anti seize, or any similar type of lubricant, is not
to allow an item to over torque after installed nor to move freely or
loosen on their own.  Once the studs are installed and tightened down,
they should hold that amount of torque and strech as you described.  But
if they are to ever be removed, they will untorque without removing the
threades as described.  The anti seize doesn't cause the inability of a
threaded part to become tight and stationary, it just keeps the two
metals in contact from bonding themselves together.  I realize you are
saying that Porsche never intended the studs to be removed, and in that
way of thinking the locktite is the answer, but here is a prime example
of what happens when things don't always go as expected or planned.

Just my thoughts,
Gary
