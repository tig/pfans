Hi everybody,
  Thank you very much to those who have responded to my
question(Menelaos N. Karamichalis, Hansman, Barry Lenoble, and others
who have responded before but I forgot to thank!) and thank you Jeff
Whiteman for the insurance help!
  I got to test drive it yesterday, it felt GREAT!! (my first Porsche
test drive!) I was really impressed! Now I really see why there are so
many Porsche fans out there!! Today I will probably be taking the 951
to where the owner says he takes it to for service, as there are no
Porsche dealerships around my area, to get it inspected as to running
condition and cost of repair. Is this a good idea? Is it an effective
evaluation of problems now and developing problems with the car? If it
turns out that the 951 is in good condition I will probably make an
offer on it tomorrow.
  Please give me a response to these questions as well as important
areas to have the shop look at such as problems that will be very
costly or big trouble. What are some of the common areas of failure,
or is it just what's in the FAQ?
  Also, I plan on having around $400-$500 a month to spend on the car
with about $320/month going to insurance and loan payments, my
question is will this be enough to own and operate an '86 951 in
average condition or even if it is in kind of bad condition? I don't
run across too many 944s let alone 951s in my area so I don't think I
would mind spending a little money on it if its less than perfect. I
will also have around $600-$1000 for reserve for emergency repair.
What does everyone think? Can I afford it?

Again, thank you SO much for your time and help!,
