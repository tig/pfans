Hello Sam
=09I agree, it could be a bad fuel pressure regulator. But do not forget =
to=0Acheck the DME coolant temp sensor. Remember - =93Garbage In Garbage =
Out=94!  You=0Ashould not have black smoke from the tail pipe. 
=09The only time I see some black smoke is when I get stuck in traffic (f=
or=0Aabout ten minutes or so) stop and go never getting on the gas, then =
finally=0Awhen I do nail it - I see a sudden burst of black smoke from th=
e tail pipe=0Awhen I go WOT for the first time after getting stuck in tra=
ffic. Other than=0Athis senario - you should not see any black smoke. I n=
oticed this with and=0Awithout the cat installed on the car!
=09I had a problem with my Fuel Reg going bad, it would make the engine s=
urge,=0Asputter, then stall out(sometimes the fuel pump would make strain=
ing noises=0Atoo), and I could see large plumes of black smoke from the t=
ail pipe. It=0Aturned out to be a bad fuel Pressure Regulator!


Good Luck
