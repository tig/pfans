Well, I've been there.  I'm 26 and owned a 87 Turbo several years back.  
I loved the car and had no problems for the 1.5 years I owned it.  When 
I had it I lived at home and it was insured under mommy so costs weren't 
a huge issue, I had no rent or nothing. I sold it to my brother for $$ 
and a 87 Supra.  When he got it it needed a clutch and sprouted a oil 
leak, and then he crashed it.  I still miss the car and forsee a 968 in 
my future.  I still have the Supra and don't really care for it, it's 
too big of a boat. I also have a Nissan NX2000 that I've modified and 
enjoy as a RELIABLE and CHEAP daily driver.  I came close to getting a 
turbo S awhile back, but reality set in.  You can't alway get what you 
want.  Sometimes you have to be practical.  You just might have to wait 
a couple of years till' you can get that Porsche.  

Also stay away from the 87-92 turbo Supra's.  I have two good friends 
with them and they love to eat turbo's and head gaskets.  Find something 
fun for now that will hold you over until you can afford that Porsche. 
I've got a very clean 87 Supra:)
