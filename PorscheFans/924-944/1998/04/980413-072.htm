In a normally aspirated motor, the loss of density due to the increased
temperature of the air being sucked up from in back of the radiator is well
known.  Why people insist in purchasing the "performance upgrade" is beyond
me.

My question is similar though.
What about in a turbo motor (951) with a intercooler?  The damn thing has
got the most pinched intake I've ever seen (top of air box), but it does
take in cool air from the fender well.  Would the increase in air temp into
the turbo affect the charge coming out of the intercooler enough to make a
substantial difference in air density entering the engine???

All the Powerhaus, Promotive and the like never seem to have the intake to
the turbo ducted to take in cool air.  Why not.  Does in not make a
difference when there is a intercooler involved?

May sound silly, but it's between a new airbox and a K&N cone air filter
$$$, besides it would be nice to have some access room in front of the
engine.
