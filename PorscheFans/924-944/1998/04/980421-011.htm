I'm certainly not an expert on 951's, but I have owned my '87 since it was
new, and I do have some appreciation for the expense of owning one. My car
now has 115,000 miles on it and I'm not considering getting rid of it. It
has had many of the problems you have read about on this list, including:
A-arms, radiator, steering rack, sunroof, hatch glass, a/c, a/c switch,
clutch, clutch master cylinder, water pump, engine mounts, and of course,
timing belts have to be replaced every 30k miles. Since 1994 the car has
been to about 20 drivers ed events at Sebring and about 40 autocrosses. I
have driven the car home after every event except 1 autocross (ended up
being a minor problem). I still drive it daily. Although there are many
problem areas with these cars, the engines are practically bullet-proof.
Mine uses no more oil now than when it was new. Is it worth it? You bet.
You simply cannot get more bang for the buck. But, if you get one, join PCA
and go to some drivers education events so you will be able to see first
hand why so many of us are hooked on 951's.
