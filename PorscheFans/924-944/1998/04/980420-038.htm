Slightly off topic, but I have found the following
when getting new keys for my 944.  There are three
key types on mine: door/ignition/glovebox, alarm,
and wheel locks.

The ignition key is easy to get from Porsche or
others like Automotion.  Except that you have to buy
that stupid flashlight which the battery burns out
in about three days.

The alarm and wheel lock keys are problematic.
My local dealer claimed that these are not available.
However, after much prodding, we finally figured out
that there is a VW key blank which will work for the
alarm.

That left the wheel lock key.  It turns out that
there is a 968 part, which Automotion carries, which
works.  It is a bit longer than the original key,
but is otherwise fine.
