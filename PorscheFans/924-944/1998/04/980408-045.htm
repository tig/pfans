Brian,
When I purchased my 86 951 w/88,000 miles 4 years ago I was a little
concerned about maint. cost's. However I am pleased to tell you that I
had no maint costs for the first year. After that I replaced my brakes
as I have always done to other cars in the past. The parts for the brake
job were around $100. The next large item to go was the altenator. I
took care of this for $35.(brushes/regulator) however it is a 6-8 hour
job!The starter went, that cost me about $125 for a new one This took 2
hrs. I just went through 2 years of maint.  I am not including any mods
that I did during those 2 years.
Now obviously the 951 you are looking at will not have the same problems
but on your budget I would say if you have plans on fixing it yourself
go for it. If however you are planning on sending it to a shop at every
maint. then forget it.
I can not stress this enough; get the maint. records & have someone who
knows a 951 look at the car.
