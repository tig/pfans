I was at Grand Prix Auto (local independent Porsche shop I wouldn't
actually use for work) yesterday afternoon to get a quote on a few items. 
Lo and behold, when he needed to find some part numbers, he went over to
his vintage 1993 PC and pulled up what looked to me like an electronic
version of the parts microfiche.  Was broken down into small sections and
had a cross-referenced table of contents.  Was a stack of maybe 7 or 8 CDs
next to the computer than he pulled this from.  That was all I could tell
form over his shoulder.  Anyone see this before, or know how to obtain it?

Any chance there's the same for the Workshop Manual?
