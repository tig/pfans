Kurt,

I used to have one.  It would have been cool in 1987, but like the wink
mirror and the windhield wiper arm "spoiler," the bra was a 1980s accessory
and it looks out of place today, whereas the 944 itself does not.  For city
driving these days it makes little sense to have a bra as they are easily
stolen.  They're somewhat of a pain to take on and off especially if you
wash your car frequently.  I don't know about the 944 front end, but on
some cars they can flap around at freeway speeds if they're not properly
fitted, causing embarassment.  The turbo bra I had was a 2-piece deal.
They do make sense for long highway trips: keeping the bugs off the front
of your car, but I would not leave it on day in and day out.

JMO,
Chris
