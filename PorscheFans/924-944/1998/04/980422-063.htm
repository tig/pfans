Frank,

	This is the remains of a Cell phone install. This is the BCN
connector that connected the Cell phone to the Antenna lead. 

It is not unusual to install the Cell phone under the  floor board where the
DME is located.

	Regards,

Dan

	Hi Everyone,

	While poking around the above units on my 951 I found the part in
the
	attached picture laying around. I have no idea if this actually
blongs to
	the car or just go in there somehow. Does anyone know what it is?
The thingy
	has "Radiall R 143042" engraved on it. Looks like some kind of air
valve
	adapter to me.

	Just wanted to know if I'm walking around with an integral part of
my car in
	y pocket...

	Happy Motoring!
