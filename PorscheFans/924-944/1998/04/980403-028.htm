To understand how the turbo works, let's refrain from saying that the
turbo does not come on :)  It is not an electrical device, it is a
mechanical device, how about, it doesn't spool up? :)

I've read what you've tried and am a bit dissapointed in your mechanic.
It seems he wanted to try everything but the basics to figure out what
is wrong.

This is what I would do.  I would love to get a bit more info from you
describing how the turbo does not spool up, but I'll take a crack at
what you've provided so far.

1. Does the car only boost up to 0.2bar or 1.2bar absolute?
If Yes, then it's a problem likely with a connection on one of the various
sensors (TPS, Airflow meter, etc.)
2. If the car doesn't produce any boost at all, we must look at how the
turbo compresses air and creates boost pressure and work from there.

The turbocharger has two sections to it, the compressor housing (cold side)
and the exhaust housing (hot side).  In the compressor housing lives
our best friend, the compressor wheel.  In the exhaust housing lives his
wife, the turbine wheel.  To create boost, the turbine wheel is spun using
exhaust energy (heat and pressure).  If all exhaust energy were focused
on the turbine wheel, the compressor would spin up to some really high
RPMS and create huge boost.  To prevent this, a wastegate is used.  The
wastegate basically re-directs the exhaust energy around the turbocharger
and straight into the exhaust system (bypasses the turbo).  The wastegate
is what allows the car to maintain a set boost level.  Did you know that
in the olden days, turbos were designed without any wastegate.  They
would spool up to their max. exhaust housing capacity resulting in a very
poor torque curve with many compromises.

Now, on the compressor side of things.  The compressor wheel is connected
to the turbine wheel with a shaft, so when the turbine spins, the compressor
spins.  The compressor wheel sucks air into the vanes and compresses
the incoming air.  If you remember Chemistry 11, PV=nRt, so if you increase
pressure, you also increase temperature of the air.  This hot air then
travels to our second best friend, the intercooler.  On the 951, we have
been blessed by an excellent sized unit that occupies almost the entire
middle section of the nose.  The unit can be improved on, but nowhere near
as much as other cars.  Once the air has passed through the intercooler,
it will be closer to ambient temps and heads through the intercooler
piping into the airflow meter, into the throttle body, then into your
intake manifold and into your motor.

So, now that you have a very basic understanding of how the turbo system
works, let's figure out what's wrong with it.

On the exhaust side of the equation:
1. Ensure the wastegate is not stuck open.
2. Check to make sure there are no exhaust leaks from the header.
3. Check proper operation of the wastegate using a vacuum pump.
4. Make sure there are no cracks in the turbos exhaust housing.
5. Make sure your cat-convertor is not clogged.

On the intake side of the equation:
1. Check all piping 10X, even the tiniest crack will reduce boost to nothing.
   Remember, high pressure air moves to low pressure so a crack would quickly
   evacuate your high pressure air in the pipe to atmosphere.
2. Make sure your intercooler is not split or corroded or cracked.
3. Check all your vacuum lines, make sure they are not cracked or brittle.
4. Check your compressor bypass valve (air cutoff valve as Porsche calls it).
   If this unit gets stuck open, it may cause reduced boost levels as it
   recirculates your compressed air.
5. Check the compressor wheel for damage.  Turbine wheels never break, but
it's
   not uncommon for compressor wheels to shatter, back off their nut, or
scrape
   against the walls.  These are fairly uncommon on 951's, but might as well
   check.  When I blew a turbo on my Talon (actually Paul was driving the car
   at that time), the compressor wheel turned to mush as it hit the side
   walls, kind of looked like my face when I got the bill to fix all that!
6. Check the cycling valve connections.  If they are corroded or broken off,
   the car will only register 0.2bar (1.2bar absolute) and will give no error
   codes.

Lastly, I would hook up an aftermarket boost gauge to get an idea of what
the turbo is actually doing.  Sometimes, it feels like the turbo is not
spooling, when in fact it is, but other areas are holding the power back
(slipping clutch, etc.)

Hope that helps you.  Remember guys, when something goes wrong, check the
basics first!  Imagine how it would feel now if you found a split rubber
hose!!!

Turbochargers are simple devices with simple diagnostics, but the past
history of turbos in the olden days has tarnished this simplicity leading
to mechanics using the "t" word to charge ridiculous prices and put their
children and their children's children through school.
