Wheel shake It is most likely a combination of alignment and balance, but
can also be due to unven tire wear.

944 models are very sensitive to front alignment and balance.  An easy
way to check if it is balance (usually) is to go around a long sweeping
corner on the interstate.  If the vibratin comes and goes (changes
amplitude at constant speed) then it is a balance problem.

Why? 
	Lets say you have two front tires out of balance by an ounce.
	If the out of balance sitation is "in phase" - i.e. both wheels
	are rotating together and the torque-moment of the tires are
	working in unison the car will shake violently since both
	wheels pull the steering rack right and left togeather.

	When the out of balance situation is "out of phase" then the left wheel
	shakes the steering rack left-right-left-right while the right wheel shakes the
	rack right-left-right-left and they tend to cancel.

As you go along a long sweeping curve on the hiway, the inside wheel
travels less distance per mile than the outside wheel, so the wheels rotate
different amounts and the wheels go in and out of phase.

Another cause of front end shake is "cupping" of the front tires.  This
is caused by loose front end components (ball joints/tire rods) or poor
alignment (usually toe-out and/or incorrect inflation or unbalanced
camber).  This is evident wen you spin the tire.  The inner edge will
have alternating high and low spots.

Excessive even tire wear at the inside edge is ususally caused by toe-out
since this causes the tires to "scrub" the inside edges.

Excessive camber (with respect to factory specs) seems to cause very
little tire wear since the tires are still rolling straight to the
road.  Most of my alignments are done with one to one-and-a-half more
degrees of negative camber (both front and rear) than the factory
specs.  I run this on all my porsches and have had very even tire
wear.
