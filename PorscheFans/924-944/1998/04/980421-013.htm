Clark,

Yes, I do know *why* the tap is tapered.  I didn't say it was tapered to hold
the bolt or stud, only that it *will* hold the bolt or stud in an interference
fit.

As for the difference in the coefficient of friction with oil vs. anti seize,
I'm sure anti seize is a little better, but probably not much ( molly
lubricants is like .06-.07).

I never said anybody *should* go use anti seize on their head studs.  What I
said, or meant to say was that *I* feel from *my* experience in similar
applications was that *if* anti seize had been used on the stud during initial
assembly, the threads would have had a *much* better chance of not pulling out
of the block.  I also said the reason *I* felt like Porsche used the locktite
on the studs initially was because they never intended the studs to be
removed.  Again *I* feel like if they had anticipated continuous R&R, they
would have used a compound other than locktite, like they did on lug nuts.
This in was way means "go out and use anti seize on your head studs".  If you
ask me what *I* would do?  Well I wouldn't be afraid at all to use studs
processed with my dry film lubricant (.030 coefficient of friction) on my head
studs.  I would use it in a second, because I have "real world" experience with
it in very similar applications.  Hey, but then again I also use a tool for the
timing belt, and we already know where people on this list stand on that.

Unfortunately, I feel this discussion has reached a dead end, and become an
"argument".  I don't think any of this is helping Farzaan with his problem. And
that's really why we are here, to help, not to fight about concepts.
Therefore it is no longer productive to this list.  So I'll shift back into
listening mode for now =)

(don't anybody go and un subscribe me now! LOL)

Thanks,
Gary
