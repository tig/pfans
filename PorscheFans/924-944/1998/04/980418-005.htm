>>>>Included note:
Dr. Steve,

Thanks for setting me 'straight' on this nearby resource (Sports Car
Tire, Wilmington DE).  I am curious about one thing;  you note:

>Repainting $55 per wheel. $10% off in sets of four and includes media
>blasting, repaint, and clear coat.  Powder coating service also
available.

Does this mean I can get a set of four 16" Fuchs refinished and
reanodized for around $200 (and no sales tax in Delaware!)?  The mystery
vendors in CA wanted almost $600!!  I want the finish to be as original,
and I didn't think anodized Fuchs were clearcoated - one reason they
need to be cleaned so much and are susceptible to stains.  If so, sign
me up, I'll come up there as soon as I get the finishing touches done on
the interior (soon, soon, I keeping telling myself, soon!).  If not, are
there reasons why the clearcoat finish is superior and does it look like
the original finish?

Thanks for your help,

Clarification - Painted wheels (i.e. Phone Dials, C@, Design 90, etc.)
can be refinished for $55 per wheel, and fuchs centers can be done for the same price.

Polishing, annodizing, reclearcoating aluminum (as in cookie ctter wheels) 
is a different matter altogether.

In order to "refinsh" a cookie cutter, for example, the wheels needs to be stripped,
the rim polished, the center painted, and the rim clearcoated.  This is significantly
more expensive.

In the case of a fuchs, the wheel must be annodized as well, increasing the cost even more.

Sports car tire does NOT offer anodizing.  They can "fly cut" which is a machining process,
then clear coat the rim on fuchs or cookies.  This results in a maintainance-free
satin finish which looks similar to annodization.  Many aftermarket clear coated
aluminum wheels (such as my Borbets) have this finish.  COst for this is $125 with o8ur choice of center co9lor.  Caps included.

THis process can also be applied to other wheels, such as the 993 and C2Cup wheels
which gives a very nice look.  Apparently Porsche did this on a number of limited production
RS Cup wheels.  In addition these wheels centers are painted with a slight blue timit to the silver.

Good question, hope this clears things up.  As mentioned previously, Sports Car Tire
does not do retail.  I am their local/mailorder rep.

Thanks much,	
Steve
