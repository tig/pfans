Oh boy,

When things go wrong, they REALLY go wrong.  The warranty company has denied
the claim because the failure was not caused by an "internally lubricated
part".  That is what the writing says and I was fully aware of it.  Now,
it's up to me to duke it out with the shop.  I'm not sure what resolution
we will come up with, but I now need to decide which way to go.

1. Sell the car for parts.  I'd really hate to do this.  The car is MINT or
   at least it was before the break-in.  Everything else is in great condition
   and I really do like this car.
2. Get a new or Porsche re-furbished block for $$$ and get the shop to install
   it.
3. Get a stroker short block with the appropriate pistons, etc.  Apparently,
   you can get these for as little as US$2100.  In addition to that, I would
   need a new crankshaft and chips.  Anyone know how much a 3.0L crank is?
4. Tow the car home and buy a used BMW 535i and drive it until I'm really
   rich, then fix the 944 :(
5. Fix the car, then immediately move it from the service bay to the
   sales floor and buy an RS America or a C2 Turbo.

I guess the worst thing about this whole thing is that all I wanted was
a new head gasket, nothing special.  It's not like a rod went flying 
through the block because of high boost or something.  I feel like I've
been cheated by the car gods.  If I knew I would need to replace my motor,
I would have run 20+ lbs of boost, at least I would have had fun blowing
the thing up!

Oh well, Stuart at Weissach Performance is putting together my options for
me right now, and I'll report what we decide on.  The Timesert idea seems
to be out, almost everyone says that will be difficult to install correctly
in the 951 block because the studs are in a dipped hole rather than the
surface (hard to describe).

As always with exotic cars, you've got to pay to play.  Anyone that says
my 944T is not a real Porsche, ha!  Look at my repair bills and tell me
it's not a real Porsche.
