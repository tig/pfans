I've noticed that when attempting to post from anything other than
the *exact* address I subscribed with, that the posts get bounced
by the list server.

What is really interesting is that the bounce is detected by
our corporate spam filter as potential spam!  (Something about
a potentially incorrect DNS setup...)  I sent some info on this
to the list manager the other day, but have not heard anything
back from him.

So if your ISP or whatever does any spam filtering, you may not
be receiving your bounces.  Thus never knowing the source of
your problems.
