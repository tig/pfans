I have a quick question. Yesterday while driving home in a fairly twisty area,
I came across a guards red 944 with quad exhaust. the car also had a very
interesting body kit that included air intakes on the rear fenders that
appeared to be for brake ducts. A rear valence was present as well as a front
turbo kit. The car said only "Carerra"
The question is what is this? The car was not very fast, or he was taking it
easy on me in my 87 944S. If the owner is out there reading, write me back so
we can get together. I am interested to see what you have done to this car?
