Fellow Porsche Fans,

I feel the need to give my two cents worth to the poor
fellow who is caught between buying or not buying a
951.

I can understand what you're going through because
one day I would like buy a 951, however, because of
what I have learned from this list and the experience I
have had with my '87 944 NA, not until I have the
appropriate funds allocated in the saving, will I
purchase a 951.

In my opinion, those who take there cars to the track
are most likely making good money anyway and/or
single and/or own their own shop, so owning a 951(or
any 944 for that matter) isn't really an issue when it
comes to shelling out the bucks for routine
maintenance or repairs.  I believe anybody worrying
about the cost of owning a 944 is probably in the
same boat that I am in, that is, can I own a Porsche (a
944 which are enticing to the average man because
they are so affordable to purchase) with a limited bank
account..... and I believe that you can't with the 951.  

944's (in fact, all Porsches) are not cars that you can
just get in, turn the key and drive!  They're not
designed for that.  However, if you keep them well
maintained, they will last a lifetime.  But, maintenance
on these cars aren't cheap! Even for the NA.  Sure
you can save money on the labor if you do it yourself
but the parts aren't cheap and if you make a mistake,
the mistake may cost more than what the original
repair would have cost if the mechanic did it.  Add a
problem to the equation and you are talking big bucks.
 I've had my '87 944 NA for 2.5 years and I am very
happy with it.  It hasn't been too bad in terms of
maintenance/repair costs.  I am averaging about $2K
a year (that included the timing belt/water pump hit as
well as a new clutch hit) but for the most part, it has
been problem free.  It does get frustrating sometimes
because it seems like something always comes up
(albeit they have been little, thank God)!  My wife
cringes when she sees me looking under the hood
(ha!ha!)

If you have a limited bank account and if you're
thinking about a 944, first thing you must do is make
sure you've found a good one, one that is/was well
maintained....and then make sure its an NA.  Drive it
for a couple of years and learn about the car in terms
of maintenance and repairs.  Then start looking to
upgrade to the 951.

If you get right down to it, think of owning these cars
as a hobby and you'll be okay.  That way, you won't be
surprised when you have to spend a little money on it.
 Oh yeah, one more thing, use it as a daily driver.  I
believe most of the 944 problems are owners keeping
them in the garage 3/4 of the year.  These car are
meant to be driven--at high speeds!

Don't deprive yourself of this fine car, just start off
slow and buy the 944 NA (i.e., stock version)

Hope this helps
