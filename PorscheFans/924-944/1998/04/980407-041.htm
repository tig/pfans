First time posting to the 924-944 page.

I have both a Euro 930 '82 and a 944 '86. The issue is with the 944. =
When I bought the car the speedometer did not work and I knew the =
reason. Now I would like to fix it and want to know the most cost =
effective way to do so.

This is the story. The car's transmission blew and the past owner =
replaced it with a earlier model year transmission. It works great but I =
was told that the older transmission is analog and my instrument panel =
and speedometer is digital?=20

Is this true? Can I some how install a "analog" speedometer? Has anyone =
run into this problem?

Short of this I love the car, but I would like to know how fast I'm =
going.
