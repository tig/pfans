ok, here is the car info.  1988 951 "S" 75,000 miles.  recent timing
belt (5K ago).

When I purchased the car I noticed it was a little low on boost 1.5 bar
on the gauge.  In closer exam, during the timing belt install the shop
had left the hose clamp facing up and it had rubbed a hole in the boost
tube.  Problem fixed right? wrong.  After replacing the tube, no change
in boost.  I also installed APE stage II chips thinking that would clear
it up.  I am up to 1.6 bar on the gauge.

I pulled the intake and replaced all hoses to the oil trap as well as
the relief valve & idle air control hoses.  no change

I spent an entire afternoon with a buddy and we wen through the test
plan in the manual the a very kind list member faxed me (thanks David
Ganapole!).  All systems checked out 100% correct.  I even replaced the
knock sensor for good measure. no change.

I plugged off the hose to the wastegate and still 1.6 boost max. So I
replaced the wastegate.  No change.

I have eliminated the cat converter.  No change.

I have checked the impeller (pressure side) on the turbo, it spins free
and is not loose. 

Tonight I installed a boost gauge to the system as follows:

I first hooked the gauge to the banjo bolt hose.  I plugged the end
going to the timing valve. in 4th wide open throttle I showed 9# to 10#
of boost.  I noticed on "light" acceleration I got as high as 13# of
boost, but as soon as I went to WOT it went down to 9 to 10 lbs.  I also
found when on light accell and I released the pedal, it would peak at
15# for a short second.

I then decided to unplug the turbo bypass valve to eliminate the boost
being routed to the intake side at idle.  This eliminated my "peak" of
15# and reduced the boost to 8# on WOT.  So it actually reduced boost.

I then reconnected the banjo bolt and tied my hose into the primary fuel
regulator.  I then got 20hg of steady vacuum at idle.  max boost was
9#.  It did not raise above 9# on decel like before.

One funny thing, at one point with the hose connected as in the last
example,  I noticed in the needle look like it as going to go up, it hit
maybe 10.5# for about 1/100th of a second, and it dropped like a rock to
9#.  This makes me wonder if the KRL box turned the timing down.  I know
the wastegate is not an issue (as in opening), as there just is not
enough boost to open it.

now I know the system is NOT in safe mode.  I unplugged the knock sensor
and I found "safe" mode real fast.  Talk about slow!  I also know it's
not just a gauge on the dash incorrect.  The car is much slower than a
regular "S".  I have checked all engine, DME, KLR, and turbo numbers. 
They are all the correct parts.  I also have no exhaust leaks to the
turbo.

Can a bad KLR box turn the timing down causing boost to be lost out the
exhaust valves?  Could the cam timing be off one tooth?  My shop said if
it was it would have idle problems.  And the car runs great! smooth,
steady, just low boost. 

Does anybody have any idea's on this?!?  I am at my wits ends.  does
anybody have an extra turbo "S" KLR box I can try? Will a plain turbo
KLR box work for a test? or is that a waste of time?

Thanks,
