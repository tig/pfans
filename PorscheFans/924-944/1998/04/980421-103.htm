To get to my main question, what is the recommended procedure for breaking in
the 944 turbo engine ('89 951)?

After a beleagured battle with oil cooler hose orientation, and power steering
pump locationing, I finally put the finishing touches to the car.  I pulled
what I thought was the fuel pump relay...

After about 10 engine rotations...the engine started, I put the relay back,
whatever it belonged to.

The engine runs...and smokes.

There was quite abit of smoke initially upon startup as the engine purified
itself of the grease and grime from my uncleaned hands.  The engine sounded
fine, however the power steering pump sounded horrible...hopefully this will
clear up.

Now for the questionable part, I let it run for two minutes, then shut it off
and checked for leaks.  Other than oil overflow from spilling oil down the
filler tube, I could find none (except for the water...)

I started it back up and let it run for about five minutes, giving the car some
revs (up to 3000).  I stopped the car, then the smoke began pouring out from
the exhaust manifold, along the manifold where it attaches to the car.  Smoke
continued to come out of the manifold for a few minutes after stopping the car.

Where is this smoke coming from?  Is it normal for the first few runs of the
car?  I just finished rebuilding the engine...

The only possible reasons (I can think of) for the car smoking are:

-valve stem seals leaking
-rings haven't seated yet (will they ever? and how do I seat them)


Thanks for any help!!
