>The people who copied him w/o
balancing the motor found that things like oil lines would crack, bolts
would
come loose, unusual stuff that never happened before.  Even though the ca=
r
felt OK, a little more vibration than stock, bizarre stuff started
coming loose and falling off.  We all feel that the high frequency
vibrations
that are soaked up by the engine mounts were causing the parts to loosen
and fall off.

So, if you are going to take the belts, assembly, etc. off, take the time=

to
also balance the motor and keep an eye on oil or any other hard lines, =

especially if the car is used at high rpm for prolonged periods of time.
You may not feel the high frequency vibrations, but your oil lines =

and eventually your pocket book sure will!<

When we first put my stroker together, there was the question of balance
shaft or no.  After doing some research, I found out the same thing, the
944s without balance shafts tended to break things on the engine when
driven hard.  To me, reliability is more important than a few hp so I
elected to keep the balance shafts in.  Of course, this didn't stop me fr=
om
blowing up the engine twice, but that is another story. =
