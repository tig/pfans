Hello PorscheFans,

My 87' 951 developed a radiator leak and I have a few questions about it. I
had everything checked that can be without going in there and ripping stuff
out so none of the obvious hoses/clamp downs are out of wack, and I'm almost
certain that it is from a hole in the radiator. I don't have the cash to
spring for new $500+ Porsche radiator and the 5 hours to install it... and I
was recommended using one of those bottles of stuff that can plug radiator
holes, the 'Silver Seal' brand specifically.

I replaced the thermostat 4,000 miles ago so my engine heat readings are
fairly accurate I guess. At first the car very slowly leaked antifreeze and it
wasn't much of  a problem, the temp. needle never went above the bottom 1/3
mark. After time though it started to rise to the 1/2 mark so I poured a
little bit of water into the coolant tank and the needle stayed at the 1/3
mark but gradually the problem repeated itself and I kept adding more water
and now I keep water with me at all times and am running 100% water in my
radiator, but I never drive more than 5 miles at a time. 

My questions are... what brand of radiator sealant crud do you guys
recommend/have had good experience with? Some of my friends say it's better to
run 50% antifreeze, 50% water or at least mix in some water. Which is best? Is
there a specific brand of antifreeze that is recommended for this car, or are
they all the same? I know it has to be phosphate free .

Thanks guys,
Chris
