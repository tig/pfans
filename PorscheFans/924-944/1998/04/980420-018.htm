PFans:

While driving my girlfriend home this weekend, my shifter ceased to
function and I couldn't select a single gear.  Specifically, I was
cruising down the highway and when I took the exit offramp, I put the
car in neutral.  When shifting from 1st to 2nd, I noticed that the
shift throw was very long.  I couldn't get third so I shifted into
fourth.  When I tried to downshift into second, it wasn't "there".  I
pulled into a parking lot and tried to engage a gear with no luck. 
Wen I pulled off the boot, everything seemed to be connected.

I spoke with my mechanic/roommate last night and although they just
put in a short shift kit a few weeks ago, he thinks that the problem
is the long black rod that connects the shift lever to the
transmission.  It is definitely connected in the cockpit but he thinks
(from my description) that the metal "post" that it connects to in the
rear may have sheared off, similar to what happens when you bend a
paper clip too many times.

Does this sound right?  If so, does anyone out there (George?) have a
used "connector rod"?  What is the cost for a new part?


The car will be towed to my mechanic today.  Thank you in advance for
your response(s).
