I bought my car already tinted.  The original owner lived in Dallas.  At
first I didn't like it because at night you do have to be careful, but =
once
I got used to it, it seems very nice... and you don't get any glare from
headlights shining in your face from the rear.

Whether or not it helps with the heat is unknown since it hasn't warmed =
up
enough since I purchased it to tell, but I think it will be a benefit =
with
my black interior.  One thing I can say, the interior is in as new
condition.

I also like the way it changed the look of the car.  You definitely =
notice
the shape of the rear hatch glass now.  My black interior with tinted
windows is a stark contrast to my son's linen interior with normal =
windows.
After driving my car, his seems abnormally bright... and he probably =
thinks
mine feels like a tomb.
