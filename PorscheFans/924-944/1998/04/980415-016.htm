Hi Rox -

Finally I get to help answer a question instead of asking one!

>This morning when I went to turn my headlights on they wouldn't pop up. I

>turned to the headlight position and got nothing.  Turning the switch
completely

Had the same problem, I found that the bushing in the arm that connects the
axle to the headlight bucket had busted. It put the system in a bind and
wouldn't let the headlight come up.
You can't replace just the bushings, you have to buy the whole axle
assembly. So being frugal I noticed that the bushing was good, just the
side of it had broke away. I cut a piece of heater hose to width to hold
the bushing up on the egg shaped section. (approx. 3/8 inch) Then split it
and trial fitted until the ends were flush. Then packed it with silicone
grease and used a ny-tie to hold it in place wedging the arm in the correct
position on the headlight bucket pivot arm.
My headlights have worked like a champ for over a month now. I do a lot of
night driving so they do get quite a workout and there have been no signs
of binding in the linkage. Total cost - about 15 min of labor and 30 cents
for materials!
