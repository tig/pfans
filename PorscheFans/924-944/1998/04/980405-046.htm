Hello Jason
=09
=09Not all chips perform the same, not all engine perform the same! By th=
at I=0Amean that there is a HUGE production tolerances difference between=
 two like=0Acars (same model/engine). They could have different; compress=
ion, timing TDC=0Areference (timing chain or belts due strech over time),=
 different camshaft=0Alift (wear) or indexing, or different ect, ect.... =
Really, the only true way=0Ato increase power is to =93tune=94 a engine o=
n a dyno or on a track. Be it with=0Ajets and seting the timing or with a=
 EPROM/chip!  Repeated back to back=0Ameasurements: gains or losses is th=
e only way to go!  

=09To be fair to APE (AutoThority) were you running 93 octane gas? After =
all,=0Aall chips are tuned for higher gas quality. Also some cars have di=
fferent base=0Asetting in the ECU dip switches to advance fuel and igniti=
on and it MAY just=0Abe that the chips from performance products make bet=
ter power than the APE one=0Adid for you. Or it just MIGHT, might be all =
in your head (NOT MEANT AS A=0AFLAME!!!). 

=09I have worked with APE as a beta chip tester and for Cyntex over the y=
ears. I=0Ahave
have seen where sometimes more or less ignition not only changes the Hp a=
nd=0ATorque but the feel and sound that the engine makes. Sometimes what =
you would=0Aswear is making more power is making a little less but feels =
oohh that much=0Abetter! That is Why APE & Cyntex also ways fine tunes fo=
r seat of the pants=0Afeel! Not just Hp and 0-60 times!  I have also seen=
 where a new =93test=94 chip=0Amight make Hp in say my car but a like car=
 of a friends car might feel like it=0Ahas less the stock Hp! The differe=
nce could be gas quality, or engine break-in=0Aprocedure, or just that on=
e engine is making more power than the other from=0Athe factory! Sometime=
s the ECU level (some years had more than one ECU chip,=0Asometimes they =
have to be compatible) can also come into play. Some drivers=0Ahave a bet=
ter =93feel=94 for changes to the engine chip programming (not that you=
=0Ado not!). I have seem some people just pleased as punch with their chi=
p of the=0Aweek set-up firmly believing they have more Hp than the last =
=93hot=94 custom=0Achip, even though the chip might just have a different=
 fuel curve or ignition=0Acurve. No more or less Hp than the last custom =
chip!!! 

=09I do not doubt that the Performance Products chip is making more power=
 than=0Athe APE chip that you tested. Just know that it always is not in =
the chip but=0Athe cars engine baseline and tolerances specs. 
=09
=09As Larry Bershtein says: =93the only way to make sure you have the bes=
t setup=0A(most Hp) is a custom chip for your engine, using the gas you u=
se, on a dyno=94.=0AOther wise you will only get close to the maximum Hp =
output for that given=0Amotor.

=09Again this is not meant as a flame but just my special insight to the =
chip=0Agame. 


Just my $0.02 worth!
