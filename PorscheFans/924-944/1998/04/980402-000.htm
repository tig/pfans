P'Fans,

  I've just received my Hoosier AutoCrosser tires and would like any 
input from those members who have run them in some autox's. I've 
reviewed the TireRack website with their input on Hoosier's (not 
much), and as many other sites as I could find. All seem to favor 
"higher" tire pressure (40+ lbs), and more negative camber (~3 
degrees). 

  Info on car: 1983 Euro spec 944, wt = 1180 kg, 163 bhp, 28mm front 
sway, 210 lb front springs, Koni Gas Sport Adjustable all around, 
22mm rear sway, 27mm torsion bars, car lowered ~1.5 in, Kelly Mo$$
Racing front strut mounts, 15" x 7" wheels all around, using Hoosier 
225/45's all around, Welt Cambermeister front strut brace.

1. What tire pressures do you run in your Hoosier's? Front? Rear? 
What car are you running them on? Any special suspension equipment on 
the car? I have a pyrometer, but I want some input before I first 
start running these tires. 

2. What camber are you dialing in? Same info about your car as above. 

3. Have you had any "bad" experiences with your Hoosier AutoCrosser 
tires? (eg. "Groove of Doom/R1's) Anything to watch out for. These 
tires will ONLY be used for autox's, NO street driving at all. 

4. What pluses have you noted using the  Hoosier's? (they sure are 
light!)

  Please note that this is not a request for comparo info with other 
tires. 

  TIA.
