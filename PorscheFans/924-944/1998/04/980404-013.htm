Make sure that you fill the head with coolant before trying to bleed the
system. If you
only have air in there, it will not carry enough heat to open up the
thermostat...

Either use a funnel and add it through the bleed screw hole or remove the
hose on the
gooseneck and add through there...

On the other hand, if that does not solve your problem...it certainly could
be the waterpump.

There is a tendency (although slight) for the impeller to come loose from
the
shaft that is driven by the timing belt. This would result in a lack of
movement of
the coolant through the system...

If you have tried everything else, that could be it...

Good Luck!
