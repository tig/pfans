I'm not familiar with the Alpine model you mentioned, but I installed a 
Kenwood deck with the flip around face with no problems.  This type has a 
blank face that rotates to reveal the display and controls, and I have 
not had any interference problems.  As far as the space below your 
stereo, that is where a stock slide in storage compartment goes.  I 
installed a full DIN size Kenwood EQ in that space, and it fits very 
well.  I did have to trim some of the console at the bottom of this space 
(a horizontal bar and 2 screw holes), but it then slid in just fine.  
The console still stays in place even without those 2 screws.  You should 
not have to go to the trouble or expense of having a custom console 
built.

>>Has anyone tried to fit the Alpine CVA-1000 head unit (you know, the

>>with the motorized monitor sliding out) into a 944? Are there any 
>>potential
>>installation problems? (I.e., can the monitor completely flip to the
>>vertical position, or does it hit some part of the dashboard?) Also, I
>>noticed that there is some empty space under my currently installed
>>DIN-sized radio, but is this another full size DIN slot (which I could 
>>use for a tape or MD slave unit), or is it just some leftover from a 
>>larger space?

>>If there are problems, then I will probably be faced with modifying or
>>custom building the center console part of the dashboard. Does anyone 
>>have
>>an idea how big a deal this is with a 944, and are there any companies 
>>that
>>are specializing in at least part of this work?
