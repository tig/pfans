Fellow P-Fans,
One question and an update. First the question:What is the part nr. for the
decal that states:UNLEADED FUEL ONLY: It is located inside the glass of the
rear hatch above the fuel filler door.
The update: I had a heck of a time tying in the boost line from my gauge into
the manifold. I didn't tie into the KLR line, but I did have a machine shop
modify the banjo bolt where the KLR line bolts up to the manifold. The shop
drilled a hole into the head of the banjo bolt. Then they welded on a short
piece of metal, drilled a hole through it and then cut threads for the brass
compression fitting. No chance for leaks and it almost looks stock. It even
fooled the guys at the local Porsche shop.I also found it very useful using a
copper line instead of the plastic line that originally came with the boost
gauge.
Thanks for reading.
