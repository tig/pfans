Dear Jan

Jan, nothing personal, but You are wrong. The 944 engine is a half of V8
from 928 - we all kow that. So, it cannot be well balanced. The
advantages of riding without balance shaft  that You have described are
in fact advantages of using balance shaft !!! Ok, stop talking about
impressions, it's personal and anyone could have different opinion.
Please, consider one thing: Why Porsche did a lot of work to implement
balance shaft ? Why it's so complicated and unique design ? For produce
worse car ???  Sorry, I dont think so.

Best Regards
Tom Kacki
