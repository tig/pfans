I believe that most of the "experienced" trackers would probably recommend
that you start at about 4 lbs above your "normal " street pressures, and
then make adjustments from there.  The main point to remember is that it is
the pressures AFTER your session(s) that are more important than those
before.  Also, remember that if you plan on making any suspension
adjustments, you will have to alter your pressures.  Just don't make too
many changes at one time, or make any "drastic" changes at one
time........do everything in small increments so that you can keep track of
them........and, write down your changes and their corresponding results in
a log for future reference.  You might also keep track of weather (temp,
humidity, clouds/sun) and track conditions.
