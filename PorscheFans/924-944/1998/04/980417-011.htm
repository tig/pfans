Thanks in advance for any help that you may have to offer.

The rear end of my 1991 944 S2 Cabriolet developed a minor squeak (months
ago) at what seemed to be the top of both of the rear shocks, and recently
it started to get worse.  So, last night I was working on the rear brakes
with it up on lifts and found a bolt MISSING from the suspension arm that
bolts into the frame, just below the rear of the driver's door (trailing
arm?) right behind the rear jack-point - about a 17mmx120mm bolt.  The
passenger side was VERY loose (no threads showing).  I have replaced the
one, and tightened up the other one, but I am concerned that there very
well may be something else that needs care in this area.

I have had this car inspected twice by independent shops, and both missed
this problem.  Before I take it to another "reputable" Porsche-only shop in
my area (timing belt due), I am hoping that someone can provide me with a
rear suspension
inspection checklist, so I can pre-educate myself.

regards, 

steveh.
