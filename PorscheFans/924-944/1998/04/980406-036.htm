     Okay this is my first technical question, so be easy on me. I have a
     '78 924 that is as loud as can be. It seems the adapter (P/N
     477.253.159) behind the downpipe (front muffler) has broken right by
     the flange connecting to the catalytic converter. I've talked to my
     local dealer & they can get me this part for $81.80 (before PCNA
     discount). This is about $20 cheaper than I've seen in Tweeks,
     Automotion, & Performance. So I'm happy, except I can't get that
     bastard off! The bolts are so rusted they have all become one piece.
     Can anyone give me suggestions on how muffler shops get these things
     off? I've tried liquid wrench & WD40 & a wrench with a hammer for
     torque. Is there anything short of cutting them off that anyone can
     suggest?


     Thanks in advance,


     Ryan D. McGee
