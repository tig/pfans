To answer my own question of some time ago, the double 13mm nuts are the
ones necessary to loosen in order to allow more slip on the sunroof
clutch.  

I was not able to get a tool in the assembly to hold what looks
like a 21mm nut in place.  Thus, I had to remove the motor from the
assembly (held in by what I think were 3 10mm nuts).  Then, I held the
gear that drives the cable with plies (I really did not like doing this)
while loosing the double 13mm nuts.  I think it took less than one turn to
get the clutch loose enough to prevent stripping the plastic sunroff gears
but not enough to have the clutch slipping during normal operation.  I
made sure I removed traces of chrome and whatever else there was in the
motor gear after the operation and put the whole thing back together.  I
did not time the event, but it felt like 20 minutes at most.  I believe
that the next plastic sunroof gear I buy will be the last one for this
car.
