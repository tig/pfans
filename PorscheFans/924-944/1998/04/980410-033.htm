     There is a test procedure to check the calibration of all the gauges 
     in tech bulletin book C....my guess is that you need a new gauge.  
     Most 'twitching' i have seen is the gauge but of course since you have 
     a 951 it could be your shift knob or something!

     Greetings all.  I have a 86 851 that among its many quirks (that's a
     nice way of putting it) has a problem with the fuel gage.  When I fill
     it up it register =BE and never higher, as I drive it gets to certain
     points along the way were it twitches, it wants to go higher but =
     cannot.
     My questions are; is there a contact I can clean that would make this
     work properly.  Do I have to remove the sensor from the tank, and if 
     so
     is this hard, and I am a total idiot because it has nothing to do with
     cleaning a contact and I need a new gauge cluster.  Thanks in advance
     for all your wisdom, knowledge, and advice.
