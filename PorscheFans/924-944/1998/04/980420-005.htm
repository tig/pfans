Sherman, I have lived in Houston for 27 years, and have had Porsches for
21 of those. Paul Koby is a solid, honest, hard working mechanic who
knows these cars very well. Koby Motors (713-784-8937??) He can do most
performnace upgrades, and is very careful. 'Tho he's further out, Clark
Grigsby, at German AutoHaus is also superb, very performance oriented
(races a 944T) and excellent. He's quite responsive to all my needs and
requests. For basic stuff, not track oriented, it is a toss up. For the
track, unless you know exactly what you want, probably Clark
(281-446-5100) is your best bet. 

I have shipped twice with Horseless Carriage, excellent experience both
times.They are expensive, so I JUST USED InterCity this week!! (Bought a
70 Vette out of Pa.) They were very responsive at tracking and loading,
and did a great job. (Ask for Sharon in the main office..Dale and
Barbara Carpenter were the truckers, perfect compulsive job!) I'd use
either, let the price be your deciding factor.

Call me if you'd like: steve meltzer 713-795-5302W 713-668-4958H
