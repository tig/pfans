I need some help, last Saturday I was driving my car at a autocross when =
after a few laps I noticed my
968 not developing any power at high revs 4-6000 rpm.  The tach needle =
would just creep forward once it got to 4000 rpm and acceleration would =
almost come to a halt.  The car did not feel like it was running rough =
and in neutral it seemed to rev normally.  What could be causing this?  =
I am about to bring it to my mechanic to take a look but would like to =
know what to expect (fuel, fuel filter, DME ).
I use Mobil 93 octane gas and had a 60K service about 7K ago.
Need help getting the 968 screaming at high revs again.	=09
