I experienced the same symptoms on my 1980, replacing the cable was no =
help in my case. Closer investigation revealed that the bushing and shaft =
on which the throw-out bearing slides were beat up, preventing smooth =
axial motion when depressing clutch pedal. A temporary fix was to remove =
the inspection plate at the rear of the clutch housing and spray a heavy =
lubricant on this shaft around the bushing, being careful not to soak the =
clutch plate itself. If this really is the problem, you will see results =
immediately, just not permanently. 

To change the twenty dollar bushing is a big job.It requires complete =
removal of exhaust system, then the entire transmission comes out, then =
the torque tube and finally the clutch itself.

Surprisingly, an experienced 924,944 mechanic can do it in four or five =
hours. It is a very intimidating job for a novice.

Good luck,
