I've just read a lot of conflicting remarks about the wastegate rattle.  Let
me clarify a few things.

- The original turbo in the 924 would indeed pump out lots of psi at 2200
to 2300 RPM.  It was one of the design aspects that the first Road&Track-type
reviewers commented on most.  I can still amaze passengers (at least those
that know anything about cars) by entering 2nd gear early and letting the boost
kick in at 2000 RPM and continue boosting firmly all the way to red-line.

- My particular rattle is not a heat shield.  I eliminated that possibility
right away by removing and refitting all such sheet metal.  No change.  I
knew it was the wastegate after plugging the control pressure pipe and VERY
CAREFULLY driving the car through the normal wastegate opening point.  No
wastegate opening, no rattle.

- Accurate rattle descriptions are as hard to find as hen's teeth.  Nonetheless,
I would describe my wastegate rattle as definitely coming from the collision
of two pieces of very hard metal.  Take two chromium steel exhaust valves and
tap their heads together.  Bingo, that's the sound.  Very high-pitched and
almost brittle sounding.  Definitely not sheet metal.

- Since the wastegate is mounted on the torque tube, that might explain the
common remark that the noise comes from the back.  I don't know about this.
I never suspected the source of my rattle to be anywhere but in front of
the shift lever.
