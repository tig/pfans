Hi Lee,

I didn't get a long look at the car. It was ahead and two lanes over. I =
first thought it was a 951 and didn't pay much attention. On second look =
I knew it was different. I think the rear spoiler was body color. The oth=
er things I didn't see. Do the headlights pop up just like the 928? From =
a styling point of view the 968 seems like a great combination of the 944=
 and 928.
