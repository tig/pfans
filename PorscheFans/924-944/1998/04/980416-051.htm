** High Priority **

Hi Everyone;

   I am experiencing a new problem with my '87 944... I must confess I =
haven't fully investigated this yet, but I am now getting a fuel leak
from =
the back end of the car once it has been shut down after driving (all =
appears OK when driving).
   I haven't taken a good look underneath yet, but does anyone care to =
speculate what might be happening. (Its not coming from the tank area,
but =
rather somewhere in, or around the fuel lines/fittings)

Erik:

That's the beauty of speculating...the fuel lines w/ crack w/ age...
there is a section on the tank that is not visable to the eye...it would
be in the right hand rear corner of the tank if you were looking from
the
rear forward...you will need to drop the support strap...there will be 2 
screws that hold this "plate"...once removed you will find additional
fuel
hoses and fittings.

I'm sure you'll get a better perspective once it's on the lift.

I hope this helps

Ralph
