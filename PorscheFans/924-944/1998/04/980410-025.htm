>>Clutch problem #1
-----------------
When I depress the clutch pedal, I feel a slight vibration, that seems
to be directly coupled to RPM's. Really noticeable in 1st and 2nd gears.
I've read some archived posts where some people talk about bad engine
mounts as the probable cause. The thing is, I haven't noticed any
unusual vibration at idle, or on the steering wheel.

Clutch problem #2
----------------
This one is more subtle: when I'm stopped at a traffic light, and I
press the clutch to put the car in first gear, I hear a slight "clunk"
coming from the engine compartment. I've read about the rubber-center
saga, but I thought that the 968's came with the improved 951-type
center. Is that correct?<<

This sounds like a failing dual mass flywheel.  I have seen this before. I had
a 968 customer that had the same symptoms on his '94 968 w/26K miles. I
replaced the flywheel and disc, and the problem went away (until the next time
the d/m fails). My parts guy claims they sell lots of 968 flywheels. 

Porsche would not even talk to him about warranty on anything clutch related.
I think they saved their dual mass failure "Goodwill pennies" for the 911
customers.  

BTW, the 968 uses a 993 style clutch.  The disc does not have any springs and
utilizes a solid hub.  The pressure plate is aluminum (993 style) and very
expensive.  Apparently, before the D/M flywheel prematurely fails, it is
supposed to dampen the driveline snap, much like the damper springs on a
standard clutch.  

The entire clutch repair at list which includes a disc, pressure plate,
flywheel, t/o bearing, will cost $1900 for parts alone.  The labor is much
less than the usual 944/951 because the 968 has a two piece 928 style
bellhousing.  Nonetheless, the full bend over on this deal could easily run to
$2400!!

Porsche MotorSport sells a 968 sport flywheel and clutch setup for $2600
WHOLESALE!!!  I intend to disassemble the old D/M flywheel, remove the D/M
mechanism, machine a custom hub adapter, and fix the problem for much less on
the next one.  

When Porsche screws up, they do it first class!
