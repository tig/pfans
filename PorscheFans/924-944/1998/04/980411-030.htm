Plastic gear PN 944.564.430.01, list $5.08, $3.10 w/ PCA discount.

I have no experience w/ the S2 sunroof, but I had to replace said gears on
an 87 944S and an 87 951.  Maybe another list member cann tell us if the
S2 uses a different sunroof setup.  On neither of the two cars I mentioned
was I able to adjust the microswitches so that the motor would stop when
the roof arms were fully retracted(maybe lack of patience).  Consequently,
I had to adjust (loosen) the sunroof motor clutch so the clutch would slip
and not strip teeth off the gears when the arms were fully retracted.  I
posted something on adjusting the clutch during the past week, it should
be in the archives. 

I am not sure I understand the second paragraph.  To make sure everything
lines up well, I install the arm so that the little hole in it lines up
with the axis of the plastic gear.  Do this for both arms.  This method
has worked great on both cars.  Remember you can always fool the sunroof
and extend the arms on key Position II w/ the sunroof removed by pressing
the microswitch on the front of the sunroof opening and then operating the
sunroof switch.
