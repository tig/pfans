How were you able to get so much negative chamber? I haven't seen a 
stock car where you get more than 2 degrees negative. Most, mine
included, don't let you get more than 1.5 degrees negative.

Careful here. Toe out is used for auto cross, but not too many people
use it for road race. True, it will make the car turn in faster.
However, it also makes the car more 'nervous' and it will tend to
wander on the straights. It also causes a lot of wear on the tires. If
you drive the car on the street, I would not use any toe out.

Good point!
