Hi P-fans,

first I have to thank everybody for the response I got.
Now I have a lot of new questions about my problem.

George B. suggested to check if the crankshaft bolt is tightened
to spec.

I haven't tried with a torque wrench yet because I first have to
remove the fan, but it seems to be as tight as it can be.

I pulled the ignition cable and cranked for about 15 seconds, no
oil pressure. I suppose I should hear some noise if the oil pump
gear is slipping, but I could not recognize anything unusual.

It is not clear to me how it could slip at all, the crankshaft
sprockets for balance and timing belt seem to be secured against
slipping on the crankshaft by a key and a groove in the shaft.
Is the driving gear of the oil pump not secured the same way?
If not how is it fixed, clamped between the sprockets and the
crankshaft?

I have received two messages this morning saying that it could 
be a sticking pressure relief valve. I have thought of this
also, therefore I have removed the plug under the oil cooler
housing. A very long spring came out, but I have no idea how
to remove the piston of the valve itself. 

Does it make sense to remove the oil pressure sender and crank
a few seconds to see if there is oil coming out to check if the
oil pump is working at all?

I always thought I am a quite experienced shade tree mechanic
but I must be doing something wrong, reading the Haynes manual
everything is so easy, it tells me very simple "remove the 
relief spring and plunger from the block"...

Sorry for the rant but I'm just a little frustrated and really
miss my car.
