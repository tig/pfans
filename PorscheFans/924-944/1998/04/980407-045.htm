Last Saturday, exactly one year after I bought my car, the fuel pump
started whining. I take it to the shop today, removed the fuel pump,
but before this, in bottom of the fuel tank is a device with two wires
which goes inside it. After removing this device, I see a sort of
filter, and a sort of pump. I really can't figure what it is, neither
the mechanic. The wires are directly connected to the fuel pump.
Is this another fuel pump or just a kind of valve? We test it,
connecting the wires to 12 V (when the fuel pump is working, there must
be 12 V on the terminals), and it makes nothing. Is it possible that
this is not working properly, making the fuel pump whining? I have
checked the price of a new pump, and it is around US$200. If I have to
pay it, OK, but I definitely want the problem fixed.
In the Haynes nothing mention it, except in the current flow diagram,
in which there are two fuel pumps (one in the tank). But why? How can I
test it?
As I use the car for traveling in work, mainly long distances, I'm very
worried about it. Please, help me, I really will appreciate any advice
you can do. 
TIA
