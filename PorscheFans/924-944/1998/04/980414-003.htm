Join the club!

You could ask to see the calibration log for the device that clocked you.
But be warned when I did this I was threatend with a whole bunch of other
stuff they could through at me.

Latest on my police (ha ha ha ha) harasment is a 20 pound fine for
failure to exhibit Excise Licience (road tax). The tax disk was there
just tucked behind my parking permit. BUT as I was told by those nice
police officers. It has to be fully visiable.

Well thats it Ive got my 20 names and Im off down the police station
tonight for my weekly document inspection (I get stopped so much that
I just save them up for my weekly visit) and Im going to make a complaint.
Not that its going to do any good.

There once was a time when I would help any police officer. but right now I
think if I saw a police office in trouble, I would get out the popcorn! 

If there are any UK police reading this, You all smell of wee & biscuits
and I respect you not at all!

Drive safe people.

Richard.
