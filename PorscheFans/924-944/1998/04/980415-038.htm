     I thought the FPR was the one with the low pressure fitting.  It is 
     the one that is nearer to the rear of the car right?  The Parts and 
     Tech Catalog seems to agree with me...

     The FPR is the one with the high pressure fitting. The pressure damper 
     is
     the
     one with the slip fitting (lower pressure)...
     
     The FPR seems to be the one with the higher failure rate (at least,
     according to
     the ratio of calls that we get...)
     
     Good Luck!
