*All of the above work 

Good stuff:

Very clean interior, 4 - color matching floor mats (and say 'quattro' in
the front), no cracks in dash, no tears in seats, runs well, rides
great, clean looking

Bad stuff: (or stuff I would fix for $5,000)

There are about 4-5 little switch lights that need to be replaced, I've
replaced about 3 so far, switches are fine, just the lights are out on
some.  Front seats show a bit of wear - about 130,000 miles worth -
might have steam cleaned or covered. One nickel sized dent in passenger
rear quater panel. Lower trim on front doors starting to come loose. I
can tell the paint has been touched up at some time, but don't think it
needs repainting (although if you give me $5,000 I would, beacuse I'm
not that fond of white).  And maybe put 15 inch wheels on because it
would look better.

History:

My 215,000 mile VW Golf was needing a lot of little things, that added
up to about $2,000, so I sold that off quick and bought the Audi.  I
like it, but at the same time the ride is too soft for me and I don't
like white cars or 4 doors. 

Before I picked it up the PO (of which there have only been me and one
other, both located in southern Ohio) put about $2,000 into it - new
ignition system, new hoses, new battery, tune up, etc. (I have the
reciepts) When I picked it up I changed the oil and oil filter, air
filter, fuel filter and the O2 sensor. I have used only Bosch oil
filters and semi-sythetic 10w-40 oil, changed every 3,500 miles. The
only 'fixing' I had to do was the coolant temp sender needed to be
replaced, did that, gauge works fine now. 

I have put 8,000 miles on the car, never had a problem, good highway
cruiser.

Has original Owners Manual.

I'll throw the Bentley's factory guide in too if that would help move it
quick.

Asking $6000, will take from Audi fan $5000 (www.kbb.com = $6700,
www.carprices.com = $7500) Have found perfect 944, need cash fast!
