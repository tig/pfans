I need help from anyone on the list who has any ideas regarding my current
problem.

I have been experiencing stalling since I returned from a trip three weeks
ago. The car sometimes loses power going over bumps, and when it does, the
tach and every other gauge completely drop instantly, sometimes downshifting
and pressing the gas causes the tach to jump back to where it should be and
the car just jerks and then resumes normal driving. At idle it will also
slowly drop, starting at about 1k and it slowly drops to 800 rpms and then
the car will just die. It sometimes dies while its warming up and I have the
engine at about 1500 rpms or while its warm and if I rev the engine a little
and then just let it drop back to idle. I can hear a sound from the engine
when the car dies which sounds like the fuel is still being delivered, and
can also hear the DME box humming slightly on the passenger's side. Also, I
notice that the engine idles normally and then I hear a faint click from
either the fuse box or under the dash, and the idle drops a little, and then
it will click again and the idle goes back to normal (this repeats in a
cyclic manner). Sometimes when it dies, the car won't restart for a while,
the engine turns over, but nothing happens.

Things I have already replaced/ checked:
1.    I got a new fuel pump about a year ago so it should be fine.
2.    I just replaced the DME relay when I first began experiencing the
power loss problem (although the car never died) about two months ago.
3.    I just put a new set of ignition wires on this week.
4. I had my friend's father's Porsche dealership poking around my car for 3
1/2 hours and they couldn't find anything, and the mechanic said all my
relays checked out fine.
5. I spent 3 hours today trying to check the wires connecting to the
underside of the fuse panel (how are you supposed to remove the top anyways?
the little clips all the way around only loosened it, and most just broke
off), but the wires all seem to be tight and secure.

So if anyone has suggestions, or ideas please let me know asap. I really
need to have my car functioning, so fixing this is important, and
unfortunately, my mechanic is in Orange County, I live in LA and my friends
father's dealership is in North Santa Monica and I live too far to reach it
w/o the car dyin

thank you
