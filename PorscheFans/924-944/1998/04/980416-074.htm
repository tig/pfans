Hi,

Several list members have inquired about the costs for the 968 door =
handles
and the aero mirror kit.  Here's the info:

DOOR HANDLES

I paid $100 for the pair from Parts Heaven in Hayward, CA.  See
www.partsheaven.com for phone, etc.  I thought this was a super good deal
considering they were conveniently the correct color and they included
everything needed (locks, rubber gaskets, etc).

New handles from Porsche are about $67 each, BUT you have to buy the =
handle
pull ($10) and find a way to install that (it's attached with a special
pin), plus you also need to purchase the locks for well over $200 each!  =
It
might be possible to swap the whole lock mechanism from a 944 handle into
the 968 handle since they look the same.  I'm just having the tumblers
changed.  My recommendation would be to try and find some used ones,
although I would guess they are fairly rare and hard to find.

AERO MIRROR KIT

I purchased the aero mirror kit, part no. 944-731-901-00 from my local
dealer for $315.00 (list $447.46).  This was the price that Sonnen =
Porsche
advertised in the last Excellence and my dealer (Barrier in Bellevue, WA)
matched it.

The kit includes everything needed.  You get new 968 bases, the aero =
mirror
housings, and hollow bolts, large springs, and thrust washers...  to =
attach
the two pieces together.  There's also an internal frame, a motor =
package,
and the heated mirrors themselves, plus the necessary screws.  You do =
have
to modify the motor wires by removing the existing pins and crimping on =
the
larger ones provided.

I don't know if the kit from Porsche is the same as the kits from outfits
like Performance Products, which sell theirs for $545.

Parts Heaven did have a pair of 968 mirrors in guards red for $275 the =
last
time I talked to them.  If you buy 968 mirrors the wiring may or may not =
be
compatible with the 944's existing wiring harness, but it could probably =
be
easily adapted.

I'll let you all know how I like the look when I get the car back next =
week.
