 Wes and Gregor,
Sorry it took me so long to respond as I usually dont
get to work to check my email, and I was working on
my new garage.  As for the tint info: 
The total job is normally priced at $150 at the shop
I had it done at. (I lucked out and got it cheaper since 
they wanted to photo the car for ads and the like)
The shop did an excellent job on the hatch seams!!
They used a total of 5 peices of film to work with
all the curves on the window. They did this by putting
the seams of the film on the defog wires.  For the last 
question, I did all 5 windows in SunGuard brand 
graphite 20% tint. Looks very good and very fast Ill 
try to talk my ISP into getting the HTML server up
so I can post a pict.
Hope this helps.
-Nick Miller.
