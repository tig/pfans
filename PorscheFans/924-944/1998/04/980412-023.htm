Hi Folks,

I know that these questions have been asked LOTS of times but this time I
am paying attention :-).

What is the net-wisdom among those who track their cars for suspension
settings (front & rear) for the 944 Turbo S? I am going in for an alignment
soon and want some reasonable numbers - this is a street/track car in that
order.

Also!!

Where is a good place to get that infamous timing belt tensioning tool at a
good price (or better yet does anyone have one they want to sell?)?

And:

On the later model cars with the spring loaded tensioner for the timing
belt - how do you remove that device to replace the roller under it and
which of the three bolts do you loosen to adjust it?

Thanks

Ray Bahr
