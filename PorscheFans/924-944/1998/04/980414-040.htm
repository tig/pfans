David --

I don't know the answer to your question, but I've experienced the same
thing, and can't predict when it will happen.  Even after replacing the
front rotors and pads (Pagid orange), I will get very strong pulsing some
days and relatively smooth braking on others, doing seemingly the same
thing with the brakes.  Sometimes it will vary within a single day.  The
heavy pulsing seems to occur at a certain minimum speed under full-on
braking, but the minimum can vary between 30-60 mph.  Barry mentioned
material transfer as a possible culprit, and this seems logical in the
example you mention, but with my car, the pulsing can also happen when the
brakes haven't been heated by 10-20 minutes of heavy track braking.  It can
also happen when I first get on the track and am not pushing that hard. 
I'm starting to wonder of there isn't some inherent variability in the ABS
system and/or some change in piston control.  It's happened Pagids, Metal
Masters and Textar pads.
