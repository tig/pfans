so eloquently stated:

>R134A cooling is not as good as R12.

That's sorta true.  R134a is not as efficient.  That doesn't mean it =
can't
cool as well.  My '92 Honda Civic Si has an R134a system because I bought
the kit only a couple of years ago.  My oldest son also has a '92 Si but =
his
has an R12 system that came with the car in '92.  Both systems cool about
the same.  If anything, mine is better when it's really hot.  It also has=
 a
MUCH larger condenser.  So, yes, if you put R134a in a system designed =
for
R12 you will have less cooling capacity than normal.  However, if you =
have a
larger condenser it can work fine.
