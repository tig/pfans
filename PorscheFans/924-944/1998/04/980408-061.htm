Chris,
Don't use radiator crud.  Buy a $220 radiator from Vertex or somehwere and put
it in yourself.  It's a shadetree job, just have a couple of days of shade
available ;-)
The radiator I bought is the same as the Porsche radiator except the Porsche
emblem has been brushed off w/ wire wheel or something.  May want to consider
doing the hoses while you're down there.  I pulled mine from the bottom.
Others have pulled it from the top.

<< My questions are... what brand of radiator sealant crud do you guys
 recommend/have had good experience with? Some of my friends say it's better
to
 run 50% antifreeze, 50% water or at least mix in some water. Which is best?
Is
 there a specific brand of antifreeze that is recommended for this car, or are
 they all the same? I know it has to be phosphate free . >>
