    Okay folks I've decided I'm going to start a picture gallery of our
Porsche's.  This is partly for fun and partly in pennace.  (I went and
test drove a 911 today).  So anyway,  send me pictures off all your
924/944/968's and I'll be happy to stick them up as soon as exams are
done at University.  I've got a cable modem so no need to worry about
overloading the mail server or anything.  The only thing I ask is that
you keep it down to one picture per car.  If you happen to own more than
one that's fine, send a picture of each.  Other than that I need the
basic spec's on the car such as, but not limited to:  year, model,
colour (should be obvious but the factory code would be nice too), miles
and anything else you think is important.

    STU

ps.  I'm also thinking of starting a p-fans listing for any 924/944/968
parts that people are putting up for sale or looking to buy.  Give me
some feedback on that, I'd like to know what you all think.  I'd do one
for whole cars but there's enough of those out there already.
