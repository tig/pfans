Subject: What tires 2 get 4 '86 951?

Well, part of bringing my new 951 up to speed is getting new tires. The
old
ones are worn funny and pretty much bald at this point. Also, same size
was
used all around.

My question to the gurus of the list: Which tires (and where) should I
buy?

I do NOT want to spent a fortune, but I want the best I can get within
my
budget. I was VERY MUCH hoping to keep it under $100 per tire (less is
more...).

What I do:
Regular street driving. There is a slim possibility the car may see some
auto-Xing.

What's important:
Handling. Thread life is not a major concern as this car likely will see
less than 10.000 miles a year. It doesn't rain very often around here,
but
when it does it rains a lot! (Even when El Nino is not around), This car
would be my car of choice when the road are wet (the CAB will stay nice
and
cozy in the garage).

If I choose to sell the 951 some day I'll probably want to swap the
tires
from my S2 - that should be possible,  right?

So, with this limited amount of information, what tires would you
suggest,
how much are they, and where should I get them?

TIA,

Henrik,

I just bought a set of Sumitomo's for street use(and Kumho's for the
track). The Sumitomo's are very impressive street tires for less than
$100/ea. I bought them from the Tire Rack, 225/45ZR-16's($93) and
245/45ZR-16's($96). The tread pattern is similar to the Dunlop D40 M2's.
