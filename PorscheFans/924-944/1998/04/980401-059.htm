Hi all.  I posted about a month ago about a high-pitched whine which
is present in my stereo system.  The sound rises and falls in pitch
with engine RPM.  A copuple of listmembers advised me that this was
"alternator whine" and to check and change the stereo ground wire to
alleviate it.

I finally got around to doing just that last night, and after having
tried several different grounding locations for the deck and amplifier
I am still experiencing this rather annoying symptom.  I have a fairly
high-end system, A/D/S, Soundstream, Polk Audio, Kicker & Blaupunkt,
so I doubt it is coming from a bad component.  What's next to check?

I have installed component systems (separate head unit, amps, CD changer, 
EQ, etc.) in both my 951 and my '68 Chevelle.  I do not get any noise in 
the 951, but I did have problems in the Chevelle.  These are the things I 
did to eliminate the noise (almost completely):

Ground everything to one point.  Run your ground wires for the head unit, 
 EQ, crossover, and amps all into a common, good sized ground wire (8 
gauge should do).  Ground this to a bolt somewhere on the body or frame, 
and scrape or sand off any paint where the ground wire terminal meets the 
car.

Install a ground loop isolator.  This has RCA plugs and goes (in 
the case of my setup) between the preamp outputs from the headunit and 
the preamp inputs on the EQ.  You might need more than one depending on 
the setup.  They're about $15-$20 each.

Install noise filters on all of the power leads to all of the components 
(you don't need one for each if your headunit and EQ or your amps run off 
common leads; just one for each wire feeding the system).  These go for 
about $10-$15 each.

You can also get noise filters that attach to your distributor power 
feed.

Good luck.  Before doing any of this, I would also suggest going to a 
quality shop that specializes in car stereos for advice.
