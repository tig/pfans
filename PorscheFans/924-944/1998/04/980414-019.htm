Standard feature on the 944 (and some 928s apparently).  The fan speed is
controlled by a resistor block (located in front of the windshield,
under the little plastic cover.  Heat can make the contacts in the block
fail.  Some on this list were able to use contact cleaner on the resistor
block and restore propoer operation.  George B proabably has a resistor
block for you if yours is beyond repair.

:-) :-) :-)  Many, many owners of 911s have discovered how much better
their heater works when the sunroof is open and the car is moving
(especially when the fan pulling air from the heat exchangers fails).  The
magic term here is "air flow".  When air can be pushed through the car
easily (ie open sunroof), the volume of air going through the climate
control system will increase.  Instead of the fan trying to push air in a
somewhat sealed environment, the air is almost getting sucked out of the
sunroof as the car is moving.
