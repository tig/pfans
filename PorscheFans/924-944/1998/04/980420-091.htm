Hi.

Driving home the other night I realized (it was pretty apparent) that my =
dash lights were all out.  I'm not certain that they all went out =
simultaneously though -- it's quite possible that some were already out, =
and that the last one just finally went out that day, but I *think* I =
would have noticed that earlier.  Preliminary tests make it seem as =
though it's not a fuse, so I'm wondering if I may actually have to =
change some bulbs...  If it does turn out that some bulbs have to be =
changed is it going to be a major ordeal?  From what I can see, it looks =
like it could very well be.  (This is an 87 924S in case it makes a =
difference).  How many dash lights are there anyways, and where are =
they?

Thanks,

Reg
