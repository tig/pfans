You should reconsider if you are expecting 110% reliability.  The 951 is
an excellent car, but it is not a Toyota Supra TT in terms of reliability.
But even with the slightly reduced reliability, I'd take the 951 anyday.

What you are reading generally are age and wear related problems.  951's
get driven a lot, especially round and round on race tracks.  I think it
was a Porsche engineer that said 1 mile on the track is equal to 1000 miles
of driving on the road, in terms of wear, etc.  People like Barry Lenoble
drive their cars every weekend on the track without many problems.

It really comes down to these factors:
1. If you have the time and mechanical ability to work on your own car, these
   cars are relatively cheap to run for their excitement value.
2. If you don't have the time or are scared of working on your car (as I am),
   then you'd better have a big bank balance (as I don't) to handle any
   unusual things, like my head stud problem.

>not so sure.  All these problems that I am reading about, do these happen
>to every car, even the ones that have been taken care of?  I know that

I would consider my car one of the best of the breed.  It really hasn't lost
any value over the two years I've owned it.  I still get offers near
C$30,000 for it.  Although with a new motor in it, potential buyers may now
be scared away.  It was purchased with 44,000km on it.  It now has 73,000km
in 20 months of driving.  I added up my bills yesterday to use as ammo at
the shop and it came out to me spending, directly out of my pocket, $8555.73
and $6728.35 from the warranty company for a total of $15,284.08.  About
$5000 of that total was for cosmetic unneeded stuff like 17" wheels and
two sets of tires.  A lot of preventative maintenance was done and I hate
anything wrong with my car, it drives me nuts, so anything breaks, it gets
fixed immediately before it affects anything else.

On my 944/kart website coming soon, I'll be putting up my maintenance records
online for prospective buyers to look at.  My car, when purchased had 0
warranty claims on it, all maintenance was done at MCL, the local dealer,
but the PO only put 44,000km on it in seven years of driving.  He bought the
car for C$73,000, I paid $26,900 seven years later.

>maintained, am I still going to run into all these problems.  I love to
>drive and am very good at it, but I am not really into all the mechanical
>stuff.  It sounds like I am going to be spending an arm and a leg just to

Going from a Talon to the 944, I thought I was pretty good at driving too;
ha!  This car makes a fool of even a decent driver.  It took me about one year
to finally figure out how to drive it, and even then, it took some of the
best 944 drivers in the north west to teach me (Buetow, Hernandez).  Except
to be awed by the car's ability.  In the Eclipse, you drive to ITS limits,
in the 944, you drive to YOUR limits.  Even now, after all the time spent
learning how to drive my car specifically, I still find that I'm
at times driving under the car's potential.

>let me know.  I will trust and accept your advice.  If you tell me this is
>not the car for me, so be it ( I will be disappointed though).

Keep US$3000 in the bank.  If you can't do that, seriously consider another
car.
