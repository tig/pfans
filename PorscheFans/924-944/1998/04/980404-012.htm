What is the deal with this damn car!

Thank you all so much who e-mailed me on how to remove the thermostat.
After buying $60 worth of needle nose and snapring pliers, I finally replaced
the themostat.  Which helped NOTHING!

Okay, I'm sure you folks can help :
It's a '86 944 n/a with 124,000 miles. Likes to run at the top line on temp.
guage.
It feels like nothing is running through the upper radiator hose - the reason 
I replaced the thermostat. Could it be the water pump? When I filled up the 
radiator and tried to bleed it, only steam came out of the bleeder screw even
though it was plenty hot enough to open the thermostat.

So I took it for a drive. Temp, went all the way up so I turned on the heater.
Temp dropped a little, then heater blows cold, and temp. rose again.
Then a minute later, heater starts blowing hot again, and temp drops
dramatically.

Please tell me what it means! E-mail me direct with ANY suggestions quickly
because I'm about to go slam it into some trees and collect the insurance on
it!
