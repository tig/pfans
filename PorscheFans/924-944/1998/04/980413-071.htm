Hi all -

Okay, the ugly failed connecting rod/crank bearing has finally reared its
ugly end on my 1986 944 with over 140,000 miles on it.  Of course, the
long, lefthand, heavy g, sweeping corners from the racetrack didn't help
the age of the crank or bearings.  The crank is beyond just a slight
buffing and replacement of bearings.  Lokks like a rebuild is in order 
for the bottom end.

When the pan was pulled there was a baffle inside it.  Now, I thought 
that there were no baffles until the later 1987 model cars or was it that 
in later 1987 the baffle was changed to allow for less oil migration away 
from the oil pick-up?

Also, I have heard some of the rumors about additional drilling of the 
crank to help prevent this from happening in the future.  Anyone tried or 
have information about this?

Thanks in advance.
