Howdy,

Just returned from a beautiful weekend at Whistler, B.C.  The drive up and
down was beautiful, even if we were in a rental Civic!  I went to see the
status of my car yesterday and was able to see the head gasket.  I didn't
ask which cylinder had been affected, but it looked like cylinder 1's
metal ring had come apart from the softer material.  There was a channel
being formed heading out of the gasket from the ring.  The gasket section with
the detached metal ring is where the word "turbo" is written, if that helps
pinpoint which one went.

If it's cylinder 1, then I would say the gasket went because of age and
general wear and tear.  If it's 4, the known lean cylinder, then we might
have a fueling problem.  All the cylinders looked good, no pitting of
pistons, or any damage that would show detonation.  They are sending the
head out today to make sure it is flat.

One of my good friends with an 88 951S had a horrible weekend.  Someone
smashed a hole into the side of his pristine car and tried to pry open
the door.  Once inside, they tried to "dent-pull" the ignition.  
Fortunately, or unfortunately, these cars are not Hondas and do not just
dent pull that easily.  They were not able to start the car.  Apparently,
in their anger, they did much damage before leaving the car.  I haven't
been told the whole story, but watch your 951's around Vancouver right now,
perhaps someone has an order to fill!

Farzaan.
