Brian, the choice is always going to to be yours. Please don't let us
scare you by our "horror stories". We all have our ups and downs w/ our
beloved P-cars. However, you should take into consideration that no
matter which car you choose to purchase and own, it still and always
will be a machine. Machines require maintenance and attention regardless
if German or Japanese or British. I've had a few older Jags and MGB's, a
Mercedes 190SL and a Jensen Healey. Even if you get a Nissan or Toyota,
if something wears down, it's gonna require work and labor to replace
it. It's just that "we" in the P-list choose to tackle the maintenance
ourselves versus sending it to a dealer or shade-tree mechanic. Whatever
your final decision will be,  we hope you will be happy w/ your choice.
If you take care of your car, it'll take care of you. Even if you don't
buy a P-car, we hope you'll stick around because it can and often does
get very entertaining here!!! By the way, I was 16 years old when I
bought my first car, my beloved (my birth year) 1970 Jaguar XKE glossy
black convertible 4.2L.......don't let anyone scare you of owning a
prestigious car because of your age. If you can afford it, do it!!!

Sincerely,
