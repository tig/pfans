Farzaan,

I hadn't bothered with this while your problem was covered by warranty,
but!

This may be useless for a 951 block but years ago I had the same problem
with a Fiat twin cam I owned.
IMHO the studs were too small but that is a different story.
What I did was get some studs made that had a larger coarse thread at
the end that would connect to the block.
they looked a bit wierd ie. about 6inches of 3/8 stud with a 1/2
threaded lump at one end.
Now for the fun bit. I drilled and tapped the block (plenty of clearance
on the Fiat) in situ with the new large thread.
Fitted the new studs and hey-presto no further problems (it was still OK
5 years later I know.)

Now doing the job in-situ is not for the squeamish and it would have
felt much better using a stand drill but the existing hole made a good
lead for the drilling.

Regards,

Clive
