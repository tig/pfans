On Wed, 01 Apr 1998 10:59:19 -0800, Farzaan Kassam <fkassam@direct.ca> so
eloquently stated:

>Paul is considering selling his 89 951 and switching to a 968.

I think he will miss the turbo rush and power, but other than that he =
will
like the 968 very much.

>What is a realistic price for a 968 in Western US (prefer Washington)
>or in the B.C. area of Canada?  How much more are the M030 cars.  The
>968 would have to be a early model (92?).

In Washington State, 968s are few and far between.  I rarely see one =
4-sale.
When I do the prices are pretty high.  Usually, the '92s are advertized =
at
$22K and up and the '93s at $24.  I don't know what they actually sell =
for,
but my guess is a '92 could be had for under $19-20K.  I have never seen =
an
M030 car 4-sale and I don't think I've ever seen a '94 or '95.  About 4
months ago there was a '93 M030 car 4-sale in Autoweek for around $25K.

If Paul can swing the price I'd get the '93 or newer.  The first year of =
any
car always has some teething problems.  On the other hand, any '92 should
have had any little problems fixed by now.
