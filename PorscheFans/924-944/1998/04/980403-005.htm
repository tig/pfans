All-

I had the grevious misfortune to hit a deer with my beloved 951 three 
nights ago.  My once perfect vehicle now has a smashed in front 
passenger side, buckled hood, assorted dents and scrapes.  Bad 
enough, but I went out to start it this AM and the battery is dead.  
Besides the difficulty in getting the car running so I can take it to 
the shop for estimates (the hood is buckled, and pushed onto the 
windshield at the very bottom corner--I'm afraid that if I try to pry 
it open, the windshield may decide to go--and considering the deer 
was nice enough not to smash the windshield, as it went up and over 
the car, I'd rather keep it one piece) I'm wondering 'why the dead 
battery?'  Someone earlier had posted about their batt going dead 
after leaving the rear hatch open even with the light unplugged, so 
I'm wondering if, even though I turned the lights out, they can't 
close because the right one is obliterated, is that what discharged 
my batt?  I have installed one of those 'automatic' battery chargers 
permanently onto the battery, and if I can squirrel that plug out 
through the buckle in the hood, I'll be able to charge the battery, 
but if not, I'm considering popping the clutch to get her going, even 
though  I've heard you shouldn't do that with cars that have 
catalytic converters.  So, are the popped headlights the cause of the 
dead battery, and if need be, can I pop the clutch to get going?

As always, your help is greatly appreciated,
