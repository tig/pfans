Whoa!  Can anyone confirm that this is possible?  If I write something
someone doesn't like, they can have me removed from the list?

Gary, I'm sorry about your experience, but I have to say I've gotten
nothing but support from the 928 list.  I joined while I was looking
for a car, asked questions - some of them kinda dumb - and got good
answers, found a broker through the list who then found me a car,
and since then have gotten continued help with all sorts of things.
