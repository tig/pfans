Ok, I'va got my 1989 944 on the road but I still have a
couple of problems.

The gearbox is whining and doesn't shift very nice. I already
had the gearbox out when I changed the clutch but I didn't
know the gearbox was bad at that time otherwise I would
have put in another right away. Now the question: has anybody
changed the gearbox without removing the exhaust?

The thermostat for the heating control only works correctly
the first couple of minutes after 10 to 15 minutes the air
which is coming out gradually gets colder until I have to 
set it at 30 degrees Celsius to get warm air (22-23 degrees
Celsius). Where is the sensor and control circuit and how
do I get to it?

Also the light behind the digital clock does not work,
how do I get to that, how do I remove the glovebox?

Thanks.

Paul
