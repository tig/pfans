Howdy,

Just returned from our seventh straight weekend of racing!  It seems like
the DSM/944 Challenge was just a few days ago things have gone by so fast.

On Saturday was a practice day at the Cultus Lake track.  I finally got
enough balls to hold the kart wide open over this tricky section I was
having major problems with the last time I was there.  What a rush, but
by the 14th lap, my arms felt like they were going to fall off, a very
physical track.

We now have our lap timers installed so we can see what we are turning
(even though it really isn't important at this stage of driver development).
On Saturday, I got down to a consistent high 27 time with a best of 
27.75, most laps being around 27.8-28.0.  I think I got in close to an
hour of track time bringing my poor little just past eight hours of race
time.  Paul was having all sorts of problems with clutches and the
throttle getting stuck open.  He managed to get down to a 28.3.  Both of
us were geared wrong.  I feel the karts were capable of low 27's if
the gearing was correct.  We changed the gears at the end, but didn't have
a chance to test them.  We would do that on the race day (Sunday).  

Unfortunately, Sunday was raining and my rain wheels/tires are not here
yet, so I sat out that race (what a horrible feeling BTW).  Paul ran his
first official race and did really well.  He only spun once in a pre-final
without any real consequence.  He finished 2nd out of five karts, but don't
let the low entry number fool you, he drove his heart out to get to 2nd
from 4th.

So, another race weekend has come and gone.  My 944T is driving me nuts 
right now.  It's got an annoying noise coming from under the dash somewhere
that I have to deal with, I think my windshield has a pinhole leak in it
and I seem to be losing a touch of coolant every day, but we can't figure
out where it's going (headgasket test showed everything AOK).  I can't 
believe how slow my 944 feels after driving the kart, I think I need a 
3.0L stroker with a K27 or a few Jato rockets attached to the rear
underwing.

In the coming year, I think I'm going to work on personalizing my 944 a bit
more.  I'm considering getting the S2/968 rear wing put on and maybe a set
of those cool 18" BBS race wheels and some big reds (I love big brakes).

The only bad part with the 944T around here nowadays is that you can't even
remotely use its potential anymore.  We have photo-radar everywhere, the
police have become really strict with speed enforcement and even the public
is starting to buy into the government propaganda(sp?) of "Speed Kills" so
you have these drones driving around at 50km/h which is a very uncomfortable
speed for the 944T, mid second gear, low 3rd gear.

Even late at night, it's not uncommon to see the police sitting on the side
of the road waiting for you to drone by at the speed limit.  It's also not
uncommon to see a red streak followed distantly by a white slower streak
with red and blues flashing :)

I'm getting too old for this stuff.

Farzaan.
