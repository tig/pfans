Raphael: according to Jim Pasha the 944 series cannot start on less than
3 cranks. According to him the first crank sets the crankcase reference,
the second sets the speed reference and I can't remember what he said
the third crank does! Here I refer to engine cranks, not turns of the
key. If your S2 dies _after_ starting up you have ignition/fuel
problems, ignore the rest of this message and take it to a shop!

My '84 944 has never started on less than 3 cranks in the last 4 years.
It has never NOT started on 3 cranks either! This winter I had to leave
it in sub-zero temperatures with snow piled on it for 4.5 weeks. Came
back, scraped the ice off, and it started up on three cranks. The only
times it starts faster is when I have mistimed the first start and crank
it immediately after the first attempt. I assume the computer remembers
the sensor positions for a short time. This is a 107k mile car.

My S2 is a different story. This 37k mile car takes 5-7 cranks to start
EVERY time. Regardless of temperature. It also drains far more power
than my '84, probably to maintain all the electronics. 60 ma compared to
12 ma on the '84 944 with the ignition off and alarm on. The S2 owner's
manual also states that unlike the 951, the S2 DME will lose all
reference information if the battery is disconnected, and it needs to be
idled for 10 minutes after starting with the battery reconnected, for
the DME to restore information, before the idle speed and emissions will
stabilize. This implies a fairly large amount of information that needs
to be kept alive.

The S2 also has larger displacement to push, and higher compression than
the 944 and the 951, but with the same size starter motor and solenoid.
I would expect this motor to start more reluctantly. The owner's manual
states a maximum of 10 seconds cranking. 5-7 cranks only take 2 seconds,
so IMHO this is one of those issues (like the temp gauge) that can be
ignored so long as the problem is consistent and below any dangerous
limits. Unless your S2 cranks slower every morning, or starts
inconsistently, I would not worry.
