Farzaan:
While rebuilding a 951 motor this past winter, I had the exact
experience you saw.  This was a club race motor.  

I decided to time-sert it.  Bough kit from Wurth and found only one
problem.  The edge chamfer tool, which MUST be used to make time-sert
hold, will not fit into the existing block hole for the stud.  I bought
an 18mm hand reamer and turned it by hand  down to the rethreaded hole.

BTW, I had to cut down the square ends on the WURTH reamer, tap and 
sert hold holder/knurler to fit my tap handles which were a machinist's
3/8" inch extended set.

Fix has seemed to work well so far.  Used loctite on head end of
RaceWare studs.  Has gone through 2 club races and have not seen any
problems yet.  I just can't believe you would have to trash the block. 
If you do, let me know, may could use a spare.Good luck.
