Rox,

I would personally not attempt to polish your windshield. You stated the
scratch was directly in your field of vision, in California (and probably
other states) it is illegal to polish/repair and defect within the drivers
direct field of vision, and most reputable glass shops will not do so. The
reason for this is distortion of the drivers field of view. I had a 300ZX
once that I did have a scratch polished out which was in the drivers FOV.
The result was a distortion that drove me nuts, it was like looking through
a wavy glass of thick fluid. My advise is to bite the bullet and have the
windshield replaced. If its the original windshield, its probably fairly
well pitted by now anyway. Your insurance should pay for all but the
deductible (as long as your comp deductible isn't too high) you shouldn't be
out of pocket too much.
