My 951 has had a rattle in it since the original owner replaced the
header under recall.  Later receipts show that the Porsche dealer here in
Indy
told him, yep, the exhaust rattles now.  Too bad.  I had Autocar Sports
and Classics take a look at it this week while they were replacing
wastegate
hoses, wheels (the ones that Autohaus sold me as 1986 wheels that were
really 1987 wheels so I had to have them put the '86 wheels back on,
waaaa!),
front rotors, transaxle oil, and checking the timing belts.  $650
They found that the CO test pipe was broken (a normal failure and of little
consequence except probably at a concours) and capped, and that the dealer
had put a little ball bearing under the cap.  It rattled.  The ball bearing
has
been replaced with a larger one and the rattle is gone.  This is the
only case I know of where the muffler bearing was actually causing a
problem.

Still have the 1987 phone dials and 1986 computers for sale.
