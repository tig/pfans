Since my last post, I have had more problems. The half shafts have been
removed and checked again. They are fine. Then we decided to check the wheel
bearings. They were removed, checked, repacked and put back in. They were in
good condition. When test driving the car now, the noise was louder, and it
could be felt quite easily. It feels now like the "catching" is in either the
differential or transmission. The tranny was rebuilt just prior to me
purchasing the car, but unfortunately, I dont have the info on it. Now I am
getting into somewhere i dont want to play. Any suggestions? What could
replacing half shafts do to the differential or tranny? And what does it sound
like is wrong? The car shifts smoothly into all gears, but app. 1/2 of the
tiem the car is moving, you can hear an rpm matching "clunk" sound. And 1/2 of
that time (especially when at very slow speeds) the "clunk" is enough to
rattle your fillings loose.

HELP
