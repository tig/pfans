Lawrence: your post reminded me of my true "key" story!

A long time ago at Crossroads Mall in Bellevue, WA on one of those
dreary Seattle winter evenings, I came out of a Blockbusters, unlocked
the silver 944, slid in and started fumbling for the ignition. This was
about when my right hand fell on a strange shape and withdrew in horror
from a tiptronic lever! No flame intended, just an unfamiliar shape. I
rarely forget where I park, far less break into other people's cars, so
it took me a full 30 seconds to regain my sanity and understand the
freakish coincidence. Got out, locked the '83 tip, tried not to look
like a thief, and moved across one row to the silver '84 944. Unlocked
the car and sat, and three things hit me at the same time. The sheepskin
cover assaulted my rear, an overpowering stench from a box marked Pike's
Place Market (raw fish, for those unfamiliar with Seattle) my nose, and
the shriek of the factory alarm my ears. Took me a little longer to
digest this one, but the alarm helped my decision to hop out fast and
slink away from this silver '84. A quick sprint across one more row and
I was in my silver '84, with the familiar smell of 100,000 mile leather,
non-functional alarm, 4-spoke wheel and NO sheepskin.

If you think my '84 key is a freak, a couple of months later I heard the
(now functioning) alarm go off one Sunday afternoon. This was in a small
town in Eastern WA state so I took my time responding, figuring it was a
bad alarm trigger. A befuddled silver 924 owner was standing next to my
car shaking his head. We tried my key in his 924, parked a couple of
spots down the road, and it worked fine! Now, how he confused his 924
with my car is another debate!

Infer what you will from this freakish chain of events. If I had to
connect the dots, no I don't think Porsche made all silver water-coolers
with the same key! I think the 944 key is as secure or insecure as the
next car, given that a "slimjim" will unlock your '83 944 in about 20
seconds without bothering with any key. Rekeying the lock with a new
Porsche cylinder may buy you a little more variation, and making a habit
of using the alarm every time you lock the door will at least disable
the car. Now who knows what we would find if we lined up a dozen of
those long alarm keys and went at those alarm units on the early
944s...!
