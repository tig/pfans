My 1987 - 944S has developed an annoying problem with the cooling fan.
After a drive, it will typically start or stay on for a few minutes
after I shut down the car, which I believe it should be doing to help
cool things.  However, in the last week when I shut off the engine off,
the fan will continue to cycle on and off erratically, on for a split
second to maybe a minute, and then off. There is no regular pattern
either. (I noticed this morning before starting the car the fan still
going on & off, after 12 hours sitting in the garage without use).

I've pulled the fan relay, contacts are OK so I don't think this is the
intermittent problem.

Any ideas on the problem? This will be much more than an annoyance if
the fan stays on and drains the battery!!

On a less urgent note, I had asked previously for any advice on
refinishing the phone dial wheels, without luck. They look pretty mangy
(dull and splotchy grey, with chipped areas). I would like to have them
restored at a local shop, as long as there is nothing special or unique
about these wheels beyond normal shop knowledge and experience. Any
advice?

Thanks,
