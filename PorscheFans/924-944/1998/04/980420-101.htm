>I just bought a '77  martini porsche from an old lady near me.  Its in
great
shape with the origional paint and stripes.  The interior has one ripped
seat,
and two cracks in the dash but is otherwise perfect.  It has only 70k mil=
es
on
it and runs very good, i got it up to 120mph on the way home.  How much i=
s
this car worth?  The normal 924 this year is about $2000-$3500.  The only=

other "martini" i've seen for sale was for $12000.  Can anybody give me a=
n
accurate estimate for this car?  Thanks.

Sorry to rain on your martini but at $12,000 the owner must of been
drinking them by the bucket.

Recently, here is San Diego, a guy had two of them for sale.  He was aski=
ng
$2500 and $2000 for them. When I called for info, he was the most motivat=
ed
Porsche seller I have ever run across.  I had the feeling that if you lai=
d
$3000 in his hand they would both be yours.
