when all was said and done, i found that the wires going out of the
relay were frayed and tarnished. this caused poor connections and
resulted in the engine quiting when the key went back to on pos.
if you drop aux fuse board in front of reg. fuse panel, fuse panel can
be lifted up and forward.(there is a green and black wire comming out of
the aux fuse board, this goes to the fuel pump)
remove tape around wires, cut plastic ties to move panel down where you
can see connector plugs.
you can see back of fuel pump relay,check each wire for green tarnish.
"lyle" makes terminal tool to push out wires. if wire is frayed so wire
is seperated from plastic check for continuity from relay to aux fuse
panel.  also, the second plug at the back as you look at the board is
the connector for the ign.  pull it out (they only go in the right way
not to worry)look at the plug's #2 pos. look closely, and you will that
each pos. is numbered to match the wire diagram in the "haynes" book.
this is the "E" plug.  if plug is melted around the #2 pin it will short
out and the engine will stall. it kicks over while starter is cranking,
but dies when key is released, right?
i had to replace several wires, it takes time but is cheaper than
replacing alot of relays which are still good and then replacing the
wires.
let me know if you need any help,ed.
