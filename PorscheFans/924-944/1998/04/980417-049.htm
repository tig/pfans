I can understand lighter as in it revs faster, like when a lightweight
flywheel is installed.  As for sounds better, does the lack of the belt
turning the shafts eliminated some whine that constitutes part of the 944
engine sound?  

BTW, talking about belt whine, gets what whines?  The 996 engine.  Saw
the 996 Coupe and 996 Cabriolet last night.  They drove the Cabriolet in
the showroom as a "surprise" and it seemed like a large component of the
engine sound when the driver blipped the throttle a couple of times was
whining.  Did not get to hear the engine at high-rpm though.
