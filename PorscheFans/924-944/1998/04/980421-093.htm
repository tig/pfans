These sound like the same dampers I use.  The adhesive backing is there
under the protective covering.  In fact the cover says "remove before using"
or something to that effect.

To my understanding, the squeal comes from the pad vibrating between the
piston and the rotors.  The damper prevents the pad from oscillating.  The
glue does last at track temps as I recently pulled the calipers and pads and
the dampers are remain firmly stuck to the pads.

When I bought my first set of Pagid 4-2's (same with 4-4 and 4-10), the
dealer
(BT of America, the importer) said to take those antisqueal backing plates
off
and throw them away.  I've never used them since and any squeal seems to go
away within a few hundred miles of stop and go driving.  The backing plates
may be fine on the street but they are not for the track, or so I was told.

The ones that came on my 951TS were fiber and one piece on each side of each
caliper (front and rear), with two steel cylinders that fit into the pistons
but no sticky surface.  I always thought that the steel cylinders controlled
the squeal buy increasing the effective weight of the pistons and thus
changing (decreasing) their harmonic frequency.  It would make sense that
they
'stick' to the pads too but I can't imagine how long that glue would last at
brake temperatures.  Perhaps that's why mine were no longer sticky when I
removed them years ago!
