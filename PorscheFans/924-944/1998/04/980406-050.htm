pfolks,
Spent the day in the Crescent City yesterday (New Orleans) at the Freepor=
t-McDermott Golf Classic.  I went downtown afterwards and was driving dow=
n Canal Street and saw another waterpumper. Can anyone tell me what model=
 has a 928-ish rear end. It had PORSCHE embossed across the rear end and =
928 style taillights. This was one good-looking car. I have not seen this=
 model before. If the owner is on the list I would love to hear from you.=
 The car was dark green.
