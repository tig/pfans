Good day everyone,

    Was out on a date on a beautiful California evening last night.  
Drove my 83 944 all night, without any problems what so ever.  Get in 
the car this morning to go to work and the most god awful sound was 
coming from under the hood.  Almost sounds as if a rocker or something 
equivalent to it had come loose and was bouncing around in the cam 
assembly.  Ok so my question is has anyone ever heard of anything like 
this?  My other question is how easy is it to get at the cam assembly, 
or should I take it to a shop?  Thanks for any help.

Jeremy Howard
