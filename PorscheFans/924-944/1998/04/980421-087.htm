Philip,

>I have been lurking on your list for a few weeks now whilst pondering
>whether to purchase a late 80's 944 Turbo, or to follow my aircooled
>roots and go for a mid '80's 911. Just as I came down on the side of the
>944T having seen a beautiful '89 65k mile two owner this weekend, and
>now  I see all sorts of problems (expensive problems) being aired on the
>list about the 944T

Before I found the '89 951 for my son almost two years ago I had the same
questions and received a lot of replies about the situation.  I still =
have
all those notes saved.  Most people agreed the car was so good that even =
if
some had problems it was all worth it.

After 19 months of trouble-free DAILY operation (and I do mean every day)
and 17K miles, my son is very happy with the car... and so am I when I =
get
to drive it!  I was very fortunate to find a great local car with 37K =
miles
that was very well maintained and had already had some of the big ticket
items replaced (clutch and head gasket).

>the advantages over say a '85 3.2 911?

The 911 does have a few advantage over the turbo.  The engine sounds are
among the best you'll ever hear, and the body style has instant name
recognition.  Other than that... a good '89 944 turbo will blow the 911 =
away
in performance, neutral predictable handling, comfort, and real heat and
A/C.  I love 911s, but a mid 80s model doesn't do it for me... a 993?
That's a different story.

>I want to have the car professionally inspected

This is a definite MUST.  Believe me, I went through several cars before
finding one good one.  Many turbos have been driven really hard.  Sounds
like you found a nice one.  Go for it.

Cheers!
