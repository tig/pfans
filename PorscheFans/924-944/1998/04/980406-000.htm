Jim,

I am not sure about the headlight being kept open causing the battery
discharge but......
It sounds like your bonnet (hood) is distorted near to the hinges. It is
here that that the switch lies that
operates the hood light and, in all probability, also operates the
mystery relay which I suspect is
associated with the factory alarm system.

I doubt if you will be able to 'bump start' the car with a totally flat
battery so I wouldn't take the
risk. I also doubt if your trickle charger will 'do the business' as it
is not designed to fully charge a battery
However, with some simple mods you can attach a 12V battery charger to a
cigarette lighter
plug (available at any accessory shop) and charge your battery through
that. (I use this for my
trickle charger by the way.) No more than 10 amps though as you will
bust the fuse!

PS my condolences to the Deer family.

Regards,

Clive
