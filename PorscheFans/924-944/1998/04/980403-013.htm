I am laying out the plans for J's out of steel, which will be power coated
to black.

I was thinking about letting the mail order guys carry them, or selling
direct. The cost of doing a good job puts the cost in the $60 a pair range,
a lot less than the $800 Porsche wants. 

As just a show of hands who might be interested in them at that price ?

	A long time ago I asked the same question and a great man gave me a
cool
	idea.  Use two pieces of twine or wire and attach one end to the
glovebox,
	the other end to the door, one for the left side and one for the
right. 
	Worked like a charm till I sold my 944S. BTW, the man was George B.

	Another suggestion on this list has been to cut two Js out of metal.

	I have seen the circles on the glovebox doors of many other cars,
indeed
	they are cupholders, but not in the US of A sense.  They are
appropriate
	holders for situations when the vehicle is parked, ie drive-in
theaters.
	Here in the US of A we like to drink and drive (coffee, soft drinks,
etc)
	and given the performance potential of the 944, these cup holders
are
	useless for such applications.
