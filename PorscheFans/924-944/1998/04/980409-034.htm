It's pretty well known that Jerry's a big Pcar fan.

Several years ago an acquiantence of mine bought a colletion of mint
vintage cars down in Orange County.  Mostly VWs, some Caddys, Porsches,
etc..  All of which had been warehoused from the day they arrived there. 
He was only interested in the VWs, and decided to sell off the others. 
Jerry bought a 356 with 2000 miles on it (60's model, I think, don't knwo
the specifics).

I know he's also been spotted around in a C2 before.  Plus there's been the
off-and-on rumor that he owns a 959.  I'm beginning to tihnk there are more
of these out there than you may think, and wouldn't be surprised if he
really did.  (On that note, I saw the one up in the Otis Chandler
museum....  I hope my drooling didn't leave spots on it.)

Just some worthless input....  All 2nd hand, so beleive what you will.
