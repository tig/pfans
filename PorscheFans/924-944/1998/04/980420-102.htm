Message text written by Barry Lenoble
>I see a guy, in a yellow vest, standing on the track. This is very
unusual I think. I don't recall seeing any flags, but there he is, in
the pouring rain, with a rather unhappy look on his face. I stop as
soon as I can, and he walks up to my car. Let's just say that he was
rather unhappy with my driving performance. He asked what I was doing
out there, and I guess he didn't like my answer of 'just having some
fun' because he then screamed at me for awhile and told me I was done
for the day, and to leave the track. Not wanting to argue, and not
really caring because of the weather, I pulled off the track. The track
chairman came over and asked me what happened.  I told him, and he
informed me that he had no idea who that guy was, and the track chair
had no problem with me.<

Barry,

Foolish me, I thought we on the track to have fun!  No more fun for me no=
w
that I know that the tight asses rule the track.  Nose to the grindstone,=

wipe that smile off your face and you better not have any fun.  One of my=

first instructors told me that until a limo picks you up to take you to
your next race, you are out here for fun.

Jim Richmond

89 S2, fun
