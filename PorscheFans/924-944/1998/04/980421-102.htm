Hello Pfolks! Farzaan, I thought I had it bad with my tumultous 951
endeavors of recent. You guys have not had good luck down there either!
I hope you resolve that head problem soon. And thanks to you all for the
helpful info about my waterpump going after I recently did the belt job.
For those of you who did not here anything back from me about this issue
my tech is going to cut me a brake on the labor to go back in there and
install a rebuilt pump @ $130.00 plus perhaps 5-7 hours labor. 
Speaking about brakes! I recently installed new pads on old rotors for a
recent DE event and do they ever squeal even worse than before AND the
right rear brake seems to be pulling/groaning against the rotor when at
lower speeds. Is this a case where they need to be resurfaced or bled
more to let some pressure off the rears? I am contemplating changing the
rotors/calipers to those larger type Turbo S setups. Anybody got
squeekless brake packages for sale!
