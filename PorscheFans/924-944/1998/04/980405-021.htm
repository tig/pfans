Wheel lock set!  I will trade straight up for 4 alloy lug nuts my good
condition wheel lock set.  I have the socket, and the locking nuts are
light like the regular lug nuts.  I measured on a balance and the plain
nuts weigh 18.7 grams, while my locking lug nuts weigh 20.9 grams.  I am
not familiar with locking nuts, but Ive heard others say theirs are
heavy;
these are not.  In any event Id like to trade just for 4 good alloy
nuts. 
One minor drawback is that the lock socket requires 13/16" socket.

Hi again,

I just saw this post as well...

You may want to consider going to steel lug nuts. They will not come
loose at racing speeds as the alloys have been known to do (because of
the different heat properties of alloy vs. steel???). Anyway, PCA club
racing requires steel jug nuts so you may want to consider this option.

Whichever way you go, NEVER use locking nuts at the track. I wouldn't
even use them on a DE car. There are only a handful of cases where the
wheels were stolen from a Porsche while it was racing. ;-)
