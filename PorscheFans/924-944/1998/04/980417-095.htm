Been there, done that. Mine turned out to be a worn bushing
at the top of the original shocks.

Replaced with Bilstein inserts and the free play is gone.

:Please help!
:
:I have play in my front steering, and still can't find the 
:answer even after the following:
:
:1. replace wheel bearings by Porsche dealer (expensive!)
:2. have wheel bearings tightened by another mechanic after 
:Porsche dealer did a lousy job
:3. have tie ends, shocks, etc. checked by mechanic who 
:declared everything OK
:4. double checked everything myself - can't see anything 
:obviously wrong but can feel slight play in wheels
:
:Interestingly the play is only front to back not up and 
:down ie: if I put my hand on the top and bottom of the tire 
:and push and pull there's no movement but when I do this 
:with my hand on the front and rear of the tire there's 
:quite abit of movement
:
:Every time I race (POC SoCal events) the tech guys ALWAYS 
:tell me to tighten my wheel bearings, and it's now got to 
:the stage where they're not going to let me race again 
:until I get this fixed (probably rightly so).
:
:I'm so exasperated - why can't I find a good mechanic!  
:(Please let me know if you have one in the LA area).
:
:I'm hoping someone on the list can help.
:
:Thanks.
