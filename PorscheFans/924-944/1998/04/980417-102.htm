While removing balance shafts may give you a few hp, I really don't think it is
a wise decision.  For one, I haven't driven *any* 4 cylinder cars (w/o
compensating shafts) that have felt good at high rpms.  Why I grit my teeth
when my girlfriend revs her toyota celica past 3000rpm.  I couldn't imaging
taking my car to a track (where my rpm range is between 3800rpm and red line)
and having my jaw lock up.

The 944 engine feels wonderfully smooth all the way up to the redline, why ruin
it?  Besides how would oil get to the turbo (for the turbo'd cars) without that
upper balance shaft a spinning?
