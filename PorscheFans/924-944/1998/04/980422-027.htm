Ken --

If it is indeed the water pump, that happened to me once w/ a late '85 when
the timing belt was replaced.  It was tensioned by a mechanic, probably
without the "tool".  Probable cause was the timing belt was too tight, and
stressed the pump. The sound was a pretty loud high-pitched whine.  The
water pump had to be replaced.  I wouldn't count on the idea that, after a
break-in period, the noise will go away.  Use the screw driver/stethoscope
method to make sure that the noise is coming from the pump.
