I'll finish this bandwidth saga since many of you have expressed interest.  I
installed the Camberballs tonight with a pair of early model strut plates,
bought used for $30/pr.  The fit was good, and it all went together
easily--something to do with the learning curve phenomenon.  The car now
steers noticeably sharper than before, though the change was not as great as
the initial change caused by the Turbo S struts and springs.  I was pleasantly
surprised at how little additional noise and vibration the Camberballs
introduced into the car.  There was a bit more, but I expected worse, since
the C-balls replace a huge chuunk of rubber with solid metal.

Overall, the project was an easy and inexpensive one (about $800 total, with
about 8 hours of my time) with a big overall improvement.  Next step will be a
full alignment, then I'll get a chance to try the car out on the track at
Portland International Racway on April 22.
