Tony,
I take my 86 944t over 100 often and shes steady as a rock. My tires are
d40 m2's they have been for the last 4 years. If I were you I would take
it to an alignment specialist, perhaps a body shop that has access to 
frame alignement eqipment. It cold have been in an accident and the
frame is not true.
