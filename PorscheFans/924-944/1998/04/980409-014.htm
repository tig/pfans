Hi Jim,

	I just did a clutch on my 87 924S and had the same problem.  I'm assuming
that you still have the clutch housing on the car.
In my experience, it proved futile to try to remove the shaft while
installed in the car.  My solution was to remove the pressure plate while
the housing is still on the engine.  Access to the pressure plate cap
screws is obtained through the starter hole and the two other small holes
aligned with the circumfrence of the pressure plate.  to loosen all the
screws gradually will require rotateing the engine through a few revolutions.
	Once the clutch housing/pressure plate/release lever assembly is off the
car, the pressure plate can be removed by taking off the throw-out bearing
snap ring.  This procedure will enable you to fully access the release
lever shaft.  Heat the housing GENTLY in the two locations where the shaft
passes through.  Use a brass drift to drive the shaft out from the access
hole provide at the end of the shaft.  When I reinstalled my shaft I coated
the bore with a little never-seize.
