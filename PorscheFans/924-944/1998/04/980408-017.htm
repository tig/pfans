Has anyone tried to fit the Alpine CVA-1000 head unit (you know, the one
with the motorized monitor sliding out) into a 944? Are there any potential
installation problems? (I.e., can the monitor completely flip to the
vertical position, or does it hit some part of the dashboard?) Also, I
noticed that there is some empty space under my currently installed
DIN-sized radio, but is this another full size DIN slot (which I could use
for a tape or MD slave unit), or is it just some leftover from a larger
space?

If there are problems, then I will probably be faced with modifying or
custom building the center console part of the dashboard. Does anyone have
an idea how big a deal this is with a 944, and are there any companies that
are specializing in at least part of this work?

Thanks,
