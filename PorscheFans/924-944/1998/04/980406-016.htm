Well, I'll bring the total up to $.04 regarding the water in Europe.

I have relatives near Frankfort, Germany and Vienna, Austria and they tell 
me that the water in their home cities was very drinkable before the 1940's.
It seems that 500 lb. bombs and fields full of destroyed tanks make for some
rather spicy drinking water.

As for the mineral content, the waters around Munich and throughout much of
southern Germany contain dissolved limestone.  This makes great beer, much
like the waters in Kentucky make great bourbon.  Both waters will likely
make for great deposits of minerals in your cars cooling system as the calcium
in the limestone will precipitate out of solution upon heating.
