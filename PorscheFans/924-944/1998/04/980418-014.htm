Porsche spent a small fortune investing engineering time on the 944
engine.  The balance shafts are there for a reason...to smooth the
engine out and to decrease vibrations.

It is true that with good engine mounts, you may not feel much
additional vibration if you remove your balance shaft belt, and yes, you
probably will pick up a small amount of power.  The down side are some
items that you will not be aware of for a period of time.  With the
shafts not turning, the engine certainly vibrates more, even if you
cannot feel it.  This vibration will lead to additional stress not only
on engine components, but the driveline, the exhaust system and the
chassis itself.

We have seen many unusual cracks in exhaust manifolds, convertors, heat
shields, frame rails, etc. on cars that have had the belts removed that
we don't see on cars that always have the belts on and timed correctly.
The chassis itself will eventually become a "buzzer".  I hate to look in
my rear view mirror and see a dozen of me looking back at me.  I hate it
when the rear hatch vibrates at idle.  I hate it when the front hood of
the car looks like the old electric vibrating football games of the
60's.

People are free to do with their cars what they want, but it sounds like
unsound advice to me to tell others to remove their balance shaft belt
because one person has had no problem for a while.  When you work on
these cars every day for a living and see the problems people can
have...then you are more qualified to give advice to others.  

When we were racing 944's as part of the factory effort, we saw the
effects of running these cars at sustained Rpm without the belt on.

Best wishes from a driver of a wonderful, vibration free, rock solid 
perfectly smooth 951...with belts intact and good motor mounts.
