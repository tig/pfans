While I think I'm missing most of the thread (I'm receiving digest now), I'll
put my opinion on assembly lube.  For most bearing applications I'd use it.  I
just finished rebuilding my motor.  At the start I used a heavy weight oil,
however I was running into problems where the oil would end up where I didn't
want it (mostly the floor).  Case in point are the balance shafts, I put these
on the block first.  First I had problems with the oil ruining the sealant used
to attach the balance shaft covers to the block, then I had problems of oil
going through the block passages and getting all over the floor.  Assembly lube
eliminated both problems.

However, in areas where tolerances are very tight (in my case the oil pump),
assembly lube can cause items to seize.  I couldn't turn the oil pump with my
hand when I used assembly lube, so I ended up using oil for the oil pump.
 However for all the bearings I used assembly lube.

I have heard stories about people using assembly lube and having there engine
seize up due to the assembly lube drying out.  However these cases are cases
where the engine sits out for years before use.

Just my .02
