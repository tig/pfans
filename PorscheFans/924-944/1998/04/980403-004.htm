Brought my car in yesterday for it's annual physical and got some bad n=
ews.
The timing belt needs replacing and my front seals are leaking.  Mechan=
ic wants
close to $900.00 to do all the work (wants to replace rollers also).  S=
ounds
steep to me.

I looked in the Haynes this morning and will look at the workshop manua=
ls this
evening. Looks as though there is a lot of marking to do with paint.  M=
y
question is simple, is this something that I could do?  I do not have "=
the
tool" but don't think I need it for the timing belt (87' 951).  My plan=
 would
be to replace the belts and seals and bring it to the shop for tensioni=
ng of
the balance shaft belts.

Anyone have any helpful tips on doing these jobs?  Anything in the arch=
ives?
How long, and how much frustration am I looking at to do the belts and =
seals?
Where is a good place to purchase belts and front seal kit?

Thanks all -

Mark
