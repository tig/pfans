Howdy,

Just an update.  Right now, my car still sits with the head off and the block
in the car.  I talked to Rob Harrison of Harrison Performance (builds some
serious race motors around here) who has a good relationship with Weissach
Performance.  He will be surveying the damage and deciding if it's possible
to fix it while in the car (doubtfull).  At worst, we have to take the block
out anyway if we are replacing it, so at that time, he'll take it down to
his machine shop and try fixing it.  He feels 100% confident that he can
fix it to stronger than factory specs as long as he can get the block to
his shop rather than doing it in the car.

His attitude has given me some hope.  Does anyone know what the factory
rate book says for re&re of the block and re&re of the block internals?

Other options include:
1. Use a brand new 944NA short block for US$2200, strip it of all parts and
   replace with my 951 internals.  Total cost would be labour to re&re block
   and re&re internals + new short block.  Probably somewhere around C$6500
   for the whole thing.
2. The one above where the block has to be re&re'd and taken to Harrison's
   shop for the work to be performed.  Total cost is probably something like
   C$2500 + Harrison's work (est$500???) for a total of ~C$3000

Once again, thanks to this list for all the assistance.  My shop also reads
this list and are probably finding this reading very interesting.

Our 944 clan down here have had rough time this past month. Tim's car
gets brutally broken into (944TS), Mark's car gets hit TWICE (944T), my
car gets broken into, blows a head gasket and pulls a stud out of the
block (944TS) and Darren's car blows up his transmission completely
demolishing his input shaft and 2nd gear (944TS). Altogether, 944T owners
in B.C. have dumped a minimum of $30,00 into the local economy in the
past month!  Then, we could go on about the control arms, CV joints, etc,
etc.

But, even with all that expense, these damn cars are still worth it.  More
car than a 993, cheaper than a Supra TT, better looking than a comparably
priced 300ZX TT, and way more refined than any pre-964 911 cars under
C$42,000.
