Subject: erratic idling

Hello all,
     I am fairly new to the list and enjoy all the great insight provided
daily.  Here are a few problems I am experiencing with my 1984 944.  The
idle sometimes wants to stall then goes back up, back down, back up, (you
get
the picture), could this be the O2 sensor that I've been hearing so much
about?  Also on occasion a loud clicking sound comes from what I assume is
the
cruise control unit.  Has anyone experienced this problem?  Other dilemma
is
my odometer does not work.  The cable is attached to the gauge.  Is there
any
kind of sensor that could be bad or disconnected?  Oh, and one more thing, 
my
oil pressure seems to be high under normal driving conditions, what should
it
be? I realize by using the phrase "normal driving conditions", I could
confuse
some of you. :)  

Hi I have an 85 944 that had exactly the same problem, it would idle
slow-fast at about a one second cycle. The previous owner sold it real
cheap because he couldn't get it fixed . The car would sometimes idle
normally and other times idle about 400 rpm especially when the fans came
on. After several weeks of grief and a trip to the local agent (who also
couldn't help) I discovered that the rear lifting bracket on the motor was
loose causing voltage problems all over the motor. I found it by placing an
ammeter between the engine block and the battery negative terminal (mine
was showing 7 amps) with the engine running and the lights on. Any reading
indicates a poor earth.

PS my oil pressure is 5bar at 3000+rpm and about 2bar at hot idle.
Good luck
.
