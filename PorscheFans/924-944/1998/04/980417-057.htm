After participating on the list for a little more than a year now I got
tired of hearing about all the 951s out there, what great cars they can be,
and how much fun they are. I love my S2 CAB and would never part with it,
but decided to pick up a 951 when I found one for sale cheap.

PO spent a lot of money, but there are still things (quite a few) that need
to be addressed. Knowing how these cars can be money pits, I'm trying to get
a feel for if I should invest some time and money or just re-sell it.

Below is a list of problems, any input would be highly appreciated:

1: During HEAVY acceleration, the fuel cuts off (VERY abrubtly). As far as I
can tell, it must be the built in cut-off mechanism that's supposed to
protect the engine if the boost gets to high. However, my boost gauge is
stuck at 1 (when the engine is running) so I don't have a clue what boost
I'm at.

2: When shifting from neutral and into fist, the gears grind a little. Not
enough to make it really difficult to push the shifter into gear, but enough
that you feel and hear it. this does not happen at any other gears. At the
same time, the shifter is VERY loose, both in neutral and when in gear.
There is enough play sideways that it almost feels like it is in neutral
even when it is in gear. The feeling is more like it is the shifter that is
loose (i.e. a somewhat disconnected feeling)

3: When engaging the clutch, a clonking noise sometimes appears from what
seems to be somwhere in the rear of the car. Clutch appears to be
functioning fine. Also, brake pedal travels quite far before braking occurs.
Brakes seem to work fine though.

4: Power steering rack is reported to be leaking. When the wheels are turned
from side to side while parked, some noise appears from the front. It also
feels like the PS is not fully engaged.

5: On a receipt from the PO it states that he had the head machined and all
the gaskets replace. In a note on the receipt it is listed that the ceramic
coating of the exhaust ports in the head (?) is craked and that pieces are
missing. What does this mean, and how serious is it?

6: Car pulls strongly to the right. Hopefully, an alignment will fix this.
Tear pattern on front wheels show excessive wear on the right side.

7: Front bumper / fender has a small crack over the left side marker. This
part appears to be made out of fiber?? I once dinged the right fender on my
S2 and that appeared to be metal. I'm confused.

8: Most of the little buttons in the cabin don't do anything :-). No rear
defroster, no wipers (front and rear), no sun roof action, etc. Lights work,
windows work, and driver's side power door lock works. AC also works. Stereo
plays poorly on one speaker only. Both mileage counters are stuck and rear
hatch opener doesn't work (it makes the right sounds, but hatch is still
locked.

Other than that, it's a very nice car :-) Body is straight, all new
interior. Lot's of new parts... Rims seem straight and nice. Getting just a
little bit of the turbo kick has already made the purchase worth it, and if
I can the the engine working right I'm sure it'll make a great second car.

Any input, advise, suggestions, etc will be greatly appreciated.

Happy Motoring!
