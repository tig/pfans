Thanks for the reply Menelaos, I understand your reasoning perfectly but
this happens even when the car is garaged - not much room for
aerodynamics there ;-) Anyway, it's not a problem in itself, just 
thought that it might throw some light on the real problem of the fan
only working on setting 4.

BTW, it also does the same (increases fan speed) if I adjust the temp
control to a setting lower than ambient.
