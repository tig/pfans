If you really care about your head and want a harness for track type events,
not just autocrossing and driving on the street, get a rollbar or roll cage
too.  Harnesses are not meant to be used without a bar of some sort.  Have you
ever seen what happens to a car when it rolls and lands on it's roof?  The
roof caves in and the harness, unlike a seat belt, keeps you upright.  In the
accidents that I've seen, the driver's seat usually collapses rearward, saving
the driver's head.  In one case, however, a friend had his spine crushed when
the roll cage (that was not well mounted to the door sills) punched thru the
floor.  Jay Wright is now paralyzed from the waist down but is still racing.
I'd advise you not to use a harness by itself.  Harness bars, which seem to be
very popular with the 911 group, are an equal travesty.
