Hi all,

The clock light in my 88 951S has been out since I got it about two years
ago. I figured I'd get around to fixing it. Not a big deal since my stereo
has a clock.

Anyway, about a month ago I was driving home from work one day and noticed
that the clock light was on. I guessed that the element was bridging
momentarily and would go out at the next bump. It didn't. In fact, it
stayed on for another 20 minutes when out of nowhere the alarm went off.
Strange indeed. This happened about five times in as many minutes. I got
home, shut everything off and it hasn't happened since.

My guess is that I have a loose ground somewhere, but don't have the
foggiest idea where to begin looking. Everything else seems to work fine.
Any ideas.

TIA.

GR
