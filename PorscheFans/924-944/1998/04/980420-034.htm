I wholeheartedly second (and even third) what Barry writes concerning
harnesses.  Besides the basic "safety" factor, they make track, and even
autocross, events much more comfortable and less tiring, because you can
concentrate on your driving skills instead of "holding on".  I just
finished putting in a pair of Sparco America race seats and new Schroth 3
inch 6-point harnesses.  I still have to drill a hole in the floor behind
each seat for the "inboard" lap belt eyebolts.  I was able to maintain the
stock OEM 3-point belts for street use.  The anti-sub straps are mounted
directly to the seat bases, and the shoulder straps are mounted directly to
my new B-K stainless harness bar.  Now, if only my car had M030 and LSD.  I
will still retain my stock seats and swap them out for vacation time (I
don't relish the thought of a 2500-3000 mile round trip in July without
much padding or back adjustment), but the race seats are surprisingly
comfortable for short jaunts around town and rallyes.  About the only other
"modification" I will be making is fabricating a fire extinghisher mount
for the front of the passenger seat.
