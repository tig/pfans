I just wanted to say that there was once a saying in and around the racing
circles that "if you are building a race engine and you have a bolt or a nut
to put on either use lock-tit or anti-seize on it" I quess the hard part is
to figure whice to use on what application. You either don't want it to come
off or you do. I never figured that anti-seize would allow you to over
tighten. that's what the torque reading would tell you. But using anti-seize
would give you constant flow of energy over a torgued range, as would
greese. But if it steel threading into aluminum and there is heat, I would
use anti-seize. Not necesary if you are planing to never take it apart yourself.
