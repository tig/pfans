ross, the ign. switch is very simple.
if your starting sometimes i would have you pull down the fuse and relay
panel. this allows you to see the plugs of the wiring harness.
the second from the right (black plug) is the "E" plug.
pull it out and check the sockets. they are #ed and match the wiring
digram. the #2 is blk. wire, that's the ign. wire comming from the
switch.  if other connections and shorting out the blk. wire melts the
plastic and when it heats up the car wont start.
check for frayed and tarnished wires.
there is a tool made by "Lyle" which allows you to push the connectors
out one at a time. the connectors cand be ordered from a dealer, as can
the the plugs. all the plugs can be removed as they are color coded and
only go on one way. i removed  each wire from the "E" plug and replaced
them in the new plug one at a time. i hunted down the short and it not
only starts it charges even under load. just remember it's a 20 year old
car and if it looks good spend the money and time to make it run as good
as it looks.  get a book and do as much of the work as you can.
knowledge is power. if i can be etc. feel free to ask,  ed.
