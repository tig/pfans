Mark asked whether or not he can do a belt and seal job. I'd rather let =
the more experienced members address this (as to whether you can do it =
without the "tool" I think we covered that a few days ago, or was that =
all a dream? ;-)  Anyway, I have a question. Mr. Haynes in his famous rep=
air book says if you replace your own timing belt to tow the car to a dea=
ler for tensioning with the guage. Now if the tension of the belt has no =
effect on whether pistons strike valves is there really a big risk in dri=
ving the car to have it tensioned? I can see if the belt is way too loose=
 it may jump time and you've just spent a few grand but if you're reasona=
bly competent enough to set timing correctly it would seem that you would=
n't leave the belt so loose as to jump time. Please no flames. I'm just =
throwing this out for discussion.
