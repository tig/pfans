First...this is non-technical, completely uninspirational, solely to vent
and draw some sympathy post.
          Well it was a beautiful weekend and even though I knew it was
going to rain today I enjoyed my ride into work with the windows down and
the top out. My 931 was running so good it was scary,( at this point I
should have realized something was terribly wrong). I took the long way to
work, driving through the country side. Kentucky is beautiful in the spring
with windy banked country roads everywhere. So I go to work, a light day,
not too many users screwing up the networks and I decide I'll leave a little
early. I start the car...a little sputter and backfire but after a second
everything is fine,,,hmm maybe some bad gas. So off to Chevron, filler her
up and she purrs like a kitten. I put the top in and roll the windows , the
rain just starts to begin. Cruising on I-75 at about 80 life is
good...smooth as silk. I get off the ramp to get on the inner loop and she
starts to spit again. Suddenly theres a loss of power...more spitting and
then clank, clank..and all the red light pop on and she dies. This was at
about 40mph. I pull over and coast to the side, semi truck buzzing by me
blowing her almost off the road. I try to start the
car...rrrrrrrrrrr....rrrrrrrrr in that awful high pitched turning that I
know exactly what it is but hate admitting. I call my wife and the tow
truck, BTW they are not the same person but that would have made it more
convenient. We bring her home....an aura of lifelessness permeates the air
around her. In about 15 min I have the timing cover off and yes if you
hadn't guessed I sheared about 15 teeth off. * an aside, the belt only had
about 23000 miles on it.  So with that found I pull the valve cover off and
yes the #3 exhaust valve is bent. I dont know if it was Ferry's revenge for
me not putting my headlight on this week but I pissed someone in Stuttgart
off bigtime.  Its not been a good day! Kevin
