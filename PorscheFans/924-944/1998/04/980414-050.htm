This morning when I went to turn my headlights on they wouldn't pop up.  =
I
had the parking lights on as I was backing out of the drive way, then =
turned
to the headlight position and got nothing.  Turning the switch completely
off and then back on cured the problem.  I had this happen one other =
time.

Is this the beginning of a much bigger deal and where should I look for
potential causes of this?

Keep in mind the relative simplicity of the system before pushing the =
panic button. There is a relay mounted under the rubber cover on the =
headlight motor itself, I suspect this could hang up causing your =
intermittent problem. Its about twenty bucks for the 924 setup, which is =
quite similar. In terms of preventive maintenance, be sure the axle pivot =
points are clean and lubed with a spot of lithium grease, be sure the =
headlight buckets themselves are able to move freely (the motor isn't =
THAT strong) and be sure the rubber covers for the motor and gearbox and =
relay are intact.

Good luck,
