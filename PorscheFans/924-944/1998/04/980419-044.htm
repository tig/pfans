Considering the amount of time it takes to get at all the belts, rollers
and seals, it would have been prudent to install a new pump as well.
The problem is, when you remove the old timing belt and install a new
one. You can`t help but change the tension on the shaft of the water
pump(the timing belt drives this as well). Sometimes, over long periods
of time, bearing surfaces in water pumps take a set to the tension their
under.   When you change the belt this "set" is disturbed and the pump
soon begins to leak. This is no big deal if it`s a Honda Civic, you can
do the pump in one hour. But if the car is your 951, your going to be
faced with the better part of a days labor.  The ironic part is, your
mechanic was probably trying to save you money. I would go back to him
and see if you can work out a deal. Suggest that the pump should have
been done, but don`t rub his nose in it. Most good shops would try to
work it out. If you have not done a timing belt before, this is
definitely not one you should start on.      Good luck,     Dave C.
