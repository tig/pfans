Clark,

I understand that Porsche originally used locktite on the threaded end of the
stud.  I personally believe they went this route because they never intended
for the studs to be replaced.  Have you ever seen a tap used to make the blind
threads?  "most" taps are tapered at the end or bottom of the tap, this
basically creates a situation where the threads are not as deep as they are at
the top ( where the bolt/stud screws in ).  In a hole that is all the way
through, this is not an issue, but in a blind hole, a stud will "tighten" in
the threads causing an interference fit.  All a lubricant can do in a case like
this, is eliminate seizure upon removal.

As far as lubricant causing a torque problem, all I can say is we have had many
threaded applications, where the torque is tested on our dry film lubricant
(which has a coefficient of friction of .030). Customer( not some independent
lab we paid) results show threaded applications torque the same amount, but it
takes less torque to remove the bolt.  This makes complete sense, because once
the item is torqued, there is no movement between the bolt and the threads.  It
becomes stationary.  As torque is a result of exactly what Mr. Rodkey states.

As for Porsche saying to use oil during assembly, dasically they are saying the
friction between the nut and the stud needs to be reduced for assembly.  Now
*if* reduced friction truly changes torque, then you have done just that by
using the oil on the nuts.  As the Bosch automotive handbook (3rd edition) I am
holding here clearly shows a reduction in friction between steel & steel (.12)
when lubricated (.08) (pg 49 by the way).

I guess we can just agree to disagree.

Isn't this MUCH better than the timing betl tool issue?! =)


Thanks,
