The 968 and the 88 & 89 951s also came with the 33 bar rear brake regulator.
On my 968 I changed to the 33 bar regulator with the stock calipers and it
did wonders for the braking balance.  Since then I have installed the M030
calipers and now feel the bias is a little too far forward again.  I am
going to try the 45 bar regulator.  Just waiting for it to arrive.

I am less familiar with the 86 951.  I think it has the same size calipers
and rotors as the stock 968.  If that is the case I would strongly suggest
changing to the 33 bar regulator.

      I have a '86 944T and after attending promotive driving school realize
that the brake bias on my car is too far forward.  Rears hardly got warm
after
hard stops and fronts locked up.  Heard the '86 and earlier 944's had the
18/5
proportioning valve and the '87 and later cars were switched to the 33/5
valve.  Anyone know what I'm talking about or experience similar problems.
I
have carbon pads with drilled rotors all around.  I've rebled the rear
circuit
thinking there may have been air in it to no avail.  Any help would be
appreciated.  MGH >>
