>1986  944Turbo
>
>I steam cleaned the front of the engine and the power steering pump area to
>locate a leak from the power steering pump. I did not hit the intake
>manifold area or under the intake manifold at all.
>
>This was a very "light" spray with engine degreaser and a high pressure
wash
>off.
>
>I noticed that after, my oil pressure gauge was stuck pegged past the 5 bar
>mark (only with the ignition on).  I check the 2 wires by the oil filter
>that go to what I think is the oil pressure sender.  Is this the sender?
>Both wires were connected and I followed this set of wires up to the front
>of the engine to a wiring harness that collects several other wires and
>travels back under the intake.  From what I can see the wires look good and
>form a tight connection to the sender.  What could be wrong?
>
>Second problem.  I stated back that I had a "rattle" from the heat shield
on
>the intake side of the engine.  There is a bracket that connects the turbo
>exhaust dump to the side of the engine block, and between that bracket is a
>heat shield.     Well fellow members........I was not so lucky this
>time......the bolt has broken off in the block and there is no way to fix
>this problem without removing the intake, turbo and all the rest of the
bull
>on the drivers side.
>
>Now what do I do????????   I could live with the rattle but the main
concern
>is that around 2500 rpm there is a vibration where by the bracket seems to
>resonate against the block.  I don't feel that this poses a danger to the
>block, but I'm worried about the turbo going through this resonation.
>
>All the aftermarket turbo systems I see  never have the turbo exhaust dump
>bolted to the block.
>
>This car has 100K miles.   I'm not going to remove the engine to fix this.
>I'll sell the car first!!!
>
>I think I'm going to cut off this bracket mount off of the exhaust.  It's
>not bolted on any way.  If I ever remove the engine, I just have to fix the
>bracket (replace the portion of the exhaust pipe)
>
>Help.
>
>Tony Garcia
>
>p.s.   I have owned this car for 2 weeks now and nothing but these
vibration
>related problems (exhaust stud backing itself out, battery, oil pressure
>sender, leaking fuel rail, broken off bolt in engine block, etc....)
>I never had any problems with my 86.5  928S...EVER...
