Pfans:

Would appreciate any feedback re my 86 944 and a recent problem that's
developed.  Have had car stall  when moving from stop position.  When
driving seems to want to cut out.  I get the impression it may be a
problem with fuel getting to injector or some other fuel related issue. 
Have had this P for a little over a year and never experienced the
problem before.  Problem started just before I put vehicle in garage for
winter.  It is not a turbo.

When I bought vehicle had 137k miles on it.  Now has 150k.  I had the
mechanic that has been servicing vehicle for last 10 years tell me last
year the car has a good 100k of life left.  I expect with some TLC and
without having to sell my first born I can keep this baby running for
some time to come.  Any suggestions appreciated.

Thanks Much,

Elias  (eescobedo@aol.com)
