I had the hornpad off briefly this afternoon (never did take the steering
wheel off, decided against it), but after I put it back on, the horn no
longer works.  I double checked the fuse, still good.  Took the pad back
off, the wire was still connected, so that wasn't the problem either.  I
feel pretty dumb asking this question, but what could be the problem?  It
worked just fine this afternoon at the honda that was parked in in front of
the entrance to my driveway.

Thanks much,
