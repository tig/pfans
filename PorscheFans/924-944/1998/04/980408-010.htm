After another day of driving my new '83 944 I have a few more details on
the cold running problem.  It only occurs from about 1 minute after cold
start (San Diego temps ~50-60 degrees) and last 3-4 minutes.  The car
starts immediately and idles well (maybe 100 rpm too high at 1050, but I
don't want to adjust anything until I fix the first problem)  When it warms
up, something happens, the power returns and the car surges forward.  When
running poorly it requires maybe 1/2 throttle to hold speed.  If floored,
the car accelerates.  I am not sure if full acceleration is upto normal as
I only tried it once because I don't feel good flooring a car not running
well.

Could this be the O2 sensor?  airflow sensor?  Reading Haynes has been no
help so far.  Is there a warmup sensor somewhere that could be sticking?
There is a crack in the exhaust just before the cat, but it is well
downstream of the O2 sensor.

Any ideas on where to look?

Thanks
