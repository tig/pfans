I had a similar problem with my '84. After checking too much stuff, I
discovered that the connector up front by the motor had a crack in it. I
cleaned up the contacts and put everything back together but it was still
flaky. I ended up putting a piece of a cable tie between the connectors which
made the connectors fit more snugly. I haven't had the problem for a couple of
years since and the cable tie is doing nicely.
