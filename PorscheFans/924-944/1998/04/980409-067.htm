>>   Please help, I'm 21 and this is the first car I'm buying, I don't
>> want to get into big trouble after I buy it!!

Just do it.  If you are in love with the car, there's nothing that we
can say that will sway you.  You're only fishing for confirmation and
comments that will satisfy your psychological need to justify your
actions.  You just have to be prepared to take the plunge and handle all
that may go wrong down the road.  I'm sure you already made up your mind
many months ago to buy this car, and you haven't slept well since.  Do
it.  I did.  I bought an '83  944 when I was 16, and then an '86 944
Turbo when I was 17.  I paid cash, I paid for my own insurance (almost
$3,000/year BTW), and back then I paid a mechanic to do everything for
me.  Make sure you have a steady job (or two) and have an extra $1,000
in your bank account at all times to make sure things stay fun when your
car has a boo-boo.  You'll realize every penny was worth it every time
you crank it over.
