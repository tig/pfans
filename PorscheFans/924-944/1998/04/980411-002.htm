Hi - I need some help with my 89 S2 Sunroof.

Today when I retracted the clips to take the sunroof out the motor didn't
cut out and stripped one of the plastic cogs.  In fiddling around removing
bits and seeing what was wrong I've also retracted the gear completely from
one side towards the motor.

Now, assuming I get the new plastic cog (anyone know part number/cost ?),
how do I adjust the drive gear from the motor back to the right place
before putting it all together.  I'm guessing I have to do this using the
manual crank, but then am also guessing that I have to get it spot on so
that all works in synch and the micro-switches all work at the right time.

I've gone back through some old mails and Clark Fletcher seems to be the
expert on this stuff, but if anyone has any step by step instructions on
assembly process and order I'd very much appreciate it.

Please respond directly - I'm not able to subscribe to the list at the
moment.

TIA - IanS
