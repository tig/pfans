Derek:

Sorry for the misunderstanding...I know we are together on this!!!!
I, like you, feel very commited to the MFS.  No flame...I promise.

The settings I'm giving are what I run w/:  these are the same settings
that my "guru"/friend used and he had a full factory ride from Porsche 
via Alan Johnson.

Front:		Camber - 2.25/2.75 degrees negative
		Caster - as much as possible! 
	       Toe-out - *1/16 to 1/8

* toe-out is normally used for x-cross and road racing to counter
	understeer...something we 944/951'ers encounter w/our car.

Back:		Camber - 2.0/3.0 degrees negative
	        Toe-in - *slight

* toe-in will help pre-load the suspension linkage and steering @
take-off.

Please remember that these are road racing settings that will also
compliment your x-cross.  The aggresive camber settings are MORE
than the factory specs for suspension.

Hope I've helped

Ralph
