ORIGINAL MESSAGE:

From: Robzx6 <Robzx6@aol.com>
To: 924-944@porschefans.com
Subject: A-arms

Hello,
           I believe it's time my '86 944 gets a new lower control arm
on the right side. I was able to move the balljoint quite a bit with
a pry bar as Haynes showed me how. Does anyone have a preference
on who's rebuilt A-arms to use, or who has the best deal? Automotion
had the best price I could find ($199.99), but are sold out of 'em.
Is this something I should worry about right now, or can I relax and
keep driving it? I'm afraid if the joint comes undone, I'll lose control
of the car!!!
                                                 -- Rob

========================================

Rob:

The cheapest price I've seen for the captioned is Dynamic
Technologies(?) that advertises in Panorama and maybe Excellence.  The
price is $179.  I don't have any personal experience with them but the
company is run by a PCA member.  I can get the # for you tonight as I
don't have a copy of Panorama handy.

By "cc" of this to the list, does anyone have the # or any personal
experience with the rebuilt A-arms from this company?
