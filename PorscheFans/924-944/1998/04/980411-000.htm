Hi Everyone,

If I drive my 968 in the rain I can end up with a very wet carpet behind the drivers 
seat and sometimes just in front of it too. 

Anyone had similar problems ?

I've had Porsche (twice) and another guy look at it and so far no-one has found 
anything wrong. I thought it had gone away , but seems to have come back again - 
since I lent the car to my wife the other day ! We tried a pressure hose , buckets of 
water everything we could think of , but couldn't get it to get wet. I am considering 
removing the carpets to see if there is anything obvious underneath , but it looks 
like a long and tricky job.

Two points , I'm on the other side of the big pond to most of you , so the battery is 
in the boot (trunck?) and the drivers seat is on the right.

Any ideas gratefully received .

Thanks
Richard.
