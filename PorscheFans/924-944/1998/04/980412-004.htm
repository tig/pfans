That usual bugbear of the P car driver the slight tendancy to overdo 
the old miles per hour caught up with me a few days ago and I 
collected a fixed penanlty notice with a =A340 fine and 3 penalty 
points attached.

Now I am not sure if I was speeding as I was too busy getting out of 
the way of the oncoming police car to look at the speedo but with an 
otherwise clean licence and only 84.6MPH registering on the nice 
policemans VASCAR box I thought I could have been let off with a 
warning but no.  That fateful Porsche logo on the back of my 968 
seemed to evaporate any benifit I may have got from any doubt.

So I was just wondering before I pay this fine and lock myself into 3 
years of speedo watching (not wanting to pick up another set of 
penalty points!), does anyone out there in the UK know of any little 
loopholes or tricks to avaoid this outcome (preferably without going 
to court).  The officer was on his own in the patrol car so I was 
wondering if it was valid for him to operate the vascar as well as 
drive etc etc.

Probably grasping at straws...still thought I would share my woes 
with you all :(
