I have for sale many interior parts off of my '83 944 as I am gutting it
for racing.

The car currently has a working AC system, and I would like to sell it as a
whole, or major parts.  I am keeping it in the car for the time being, so
if you are in the Detroit MI area you can see it work and its condition
prior to purchase.

Wheel lock set!  I will trade straight up for 4 alloy lug nuts my good
condition wheel lock set.  I have the socket, and the locking nuts are
light like the regular lug nuts.  I measured on a balance and the plain
nuts weigh 18.7 grams, while my locking lug nuts weigh 20.9 grams.  I am
not familiar with locking nuts, but Ive heard others say theirs are heavy;
these are not.  In any event Id like to trade just for 4 good alloy nuts. 
One minor drawback is that the lock socket requires 13/16" socket.

I also have a rear wiper motor, power antenna, collapsible spare tire,
factory tool kit, the hinged console door in good condition, etc. A couple
wheel center caps in good condition, a couple in fair condition.  They are
ivory color, with the colored porsche crest.

Otherwise, any little trim pieces/seat belt parts, etc. are available;
email requests of what you might need.
