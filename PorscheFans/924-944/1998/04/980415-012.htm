As a hopeful buyer of a 88 or 89 944 S I have been looking into
insurance for the car.  I am stunned and amazed at the amount of money
seven insurance companies wanted per year for this vehicle!  Please, if
anyone can tell me who you use and what you pay I would  appreciate it.
Keep in mind that I am 28 years old, Married, with Children.  I have
never had a ticket or a accident.  WHAT GIVES!!  Obviously my choice
will have to been Liability only. ( Doesn't it seem like everyone who
ever told you they got into a accident always gets hit by a uninsured
motorist?)

This is what I was quoted by the cheapest Insurance company ( AIS )

89 944 Turbo		$4500 per year    Min Coverage both Collision
and Liability
89 944 Turbo		$400.00 per year  Min Coverage Liability

88-89 944 S		$3500 per year	 Min Coverage both Collision and
Liability
88-89 944 S		$300.00 per year  Min Coverage Liability 

These prices reflect a 25% discount for being currently insured. ( The
lady though she was going me a favor! She was one of those bubbly
people. )  If I want theft insurance add another $1000.00 per year.
