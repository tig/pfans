Hi Everyone;

Many Thanks to those who responded with help on my fuel leak! I have =
another few questions though...

Battery:
  Does the 944 require an odd sized battery, or will a certain group/type =
of aftermarket battery fit properly. If it is a specialized unit, will a =
VW (cheaper) battery fit, and if so, what model? I don't actually have the =
car yet, but I know its going to need a battery, and I want to get one =
that fits properly and won't short out on the hood!

Fuel leak:
  I took a closer look at the small fuel leak on this car. The fuel was =
accumulating on a plastic plate screwed near the tank, on the passenger =
side (back) of the car. I removed the plate, but the source of the leak =
was not readily apparent as things had dried out, and the tank was empty. =
I noticed a small tube running out from a cylindrical cannister, then =
going 90 degrees towards the front of the car, but the impression I got =
from the residue was that the leak might be coming from higher up on the =
side of the tank. Are there any servicable fittings on the top/passenger =
side of the tank itself! If so, how hard is the tank to drop down...  :-(

Thanks;
