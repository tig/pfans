Stu:

Thanks for the input.  I just s/w my mechanic and he was able to drive
the car to the garage by finally getting 3rd to stay in gear, dumping
the clutch to get it moving and then manually holding it there the
whole way home!!  Sure beats paying the $100+ towing cost...

I surely hope that the problem is a loose or missing bolt as opposed
to shearing off the "finger" that is attached to the tranny.

I'll let you know...
