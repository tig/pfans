Pfans:

Should we flame eurospeed? I like Steve, even if he is a PHD :).

I recently purchased some parts from him. He was very honest and
concerned that I was pleased. He even called me at home about a $.75
bolt that was accidently left out of the package he sent me.  Yes, he 
sent me the bolt and even offered to overnight it if I wanted him to. I
was very impressed with that.

I challenge Eurospeed to match that kind of customer service. 

Sounds to me like Eurospeed has forgotten who is the most important
thing to their business ...  The Customer! 

Kudos to Dr. Steve Timmins!
