I was under my car last night doing a couple of things and noticed the
front left side of
my sway bar had pulled loose from the rubber bushing.  What is the
easiest way to get
the bar back inside the bushing and why would it come loose?  Do I need
new rubber
bushings?

I also installed a new O2 sensor and rerouted my Profec lines.  I went
from the Boost bolt
to the stepper motor to the wastegate.  I removed the old wastegate line
and plugged off the
boost control valve vacuum line and unplugged it.  I thought the Profec
should control the
boost and the KLR could take control of altitude compensation.  The
boost control works
very well except for one thing.  As soon as boost builds to programmed
level the boost falls
off very rapidly, like the wastegate stays open and does not reclose.
The good thing is I can
adjust the boost from .5 bar to over 1.5 bar although the boost control
unit does not agree with
my boost gauge(the boost gauge is the right one).  I'm going to put it
back the way it was before
and try to get some tighter connections so maybe I will be able to get a
low boost of a least 1
bar if not a little less.
