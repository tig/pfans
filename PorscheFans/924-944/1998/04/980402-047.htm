Dear Nick:
        I had the tinting re-done on my '89 951 and with the Baltic Blue
color, it looks pretty stealth. My wife and neighbors, who had mixed
feelings about the old '83 in Guards Red, love the car.
        Keep in mind that some states (like Hawaii) have additional
inspection protocols (and charges) for tint density on tinted window cars,
and the Inspector Gods can give you a hard time depending on your tint
density.
        I think the glass itself rather than the tint absorbs the UV that
might damage interiors, but if tinting keeps things a little cooler, that
might help delay the onset of interior ageing.
        The only problem out here in the midst of the Great Puddle is that
most of the young yahoos in souped-up, dressed-up, lowered Integras and
Civics have deeply tinted windows.  Guilt by association??
