<< On my 951, my factory boost gage, under full boost, reads about 25% pa=
st
the 4th. mark after the 1 bar mark.  I know that the factory boost gages =
are
not
 reliable, but according to this-how much boost? 
 How do you get to the Porsche badge on the front. I purchased a new one =
and
 cannot figure out how to get to it without removing the intercooler??? >=

Hello P-Fans

Boost Gauge Readings?

On my =9186 951 w/APE V2.7 chips, I run 19psi (On a cold day! 16psi on a =
hot=0Aday!!) that reads on my VDO aftermarket boost gauge, and my factory=
 boost=0Agauges reads about two needle widths past the 2.0 bar mark. I=92=
d say 2.1-2.2bar=0Aon the gauge. I do not think there is any stop bar for=
 the factory boost=0Agauge. I friend of mine has always taken his 951 to =
the track and his boost=0Aguage needle broke off, because of all the shif=
ting at full boost at track!! 

How to Remove the Poprsche Badge?

I simply removed the header pannel because I was afraid of messing up the=
=0Apaint using the screw driver method!!!

Raise the headlights, remove the 10mm screw in each outer corner, remove =
four=0A8mm nuts in front of headlights, look way to the inside (they sit =
way to the=0Ainsdie of the pannel under the badge area, kind  of the inne=
r header pannel) -=0Aremove the phillips screw on eah side, open the hood=
, remove the four phillips=0Ascrews that secure the top of the header pan=
nel (by the hood latch), pull=0Apannel forward to slide it off the car.

It took me ten minutes to pull off the header pannel!
I also put a little RTV under thebadge to make sure it is secure. 

Good Luck
