Hello P-fans

FUEL PUMPS 101...

It is quite common for older VW=92s and Audi=92s to have two fuel pumps. =
The pump=0Aisdie of the gas tank is called the =93transfer pump=94, and t=
he =93fuel pump=94 is=0Alocated near the gas tank. Typically what happens=
 is the transfer pump quits=0Arunning, then the main fuel pump has to wor=
k extra hard to suck the gas out of=0Athe tank. Pretty soon the main pump=
 will die out! Also since only one pump is=0Aworking extra hard, the pump=
 will draw more =93juice=94 and burn out the fuel pump=0Arelay! That is w=
hy most shops replace both pumps and the relay and fuse=0Atogether when m=
aking repairs! 

On latter VW/Audi models they incorperated both pumps into one housing. V=
W=0Astarted doing this starting with the =9190 Corrado/Passat=92s and Aud=
i started in=0Athe late =9180=92s with the 100/200 series. The new fuel p=
ump set-up. Kind of like=0Aa =93beer=94 can sitting inside of a =93coffee=
=94 can. The transfer pump is the beer=0Acan and the main pump is the cof=
fee can!  One of the main reasons why fuel=0Apumps wear out is that they =
use fuel to cool thier bearings, constantly=0Arunning the car low on gas =
(less than say 2 gallons) does not have enough fuel=0Ain the lines to coo=
l the bearings of the pumps. Also not changing the fuel=0Afilter at the p=
rescribe times can cuase the pumps to work extra hard too!

Fuel pumps can fail in a number of ways. Sometimes not producing enough f=
uel=0Apressure and sometimes not providing enough fuel volume. This is wh=
y you=0Aalways check for both volume and pressure when testing the system=
.. 

Now all that said, it would not surprise me to hear that the 924 has a=0A=
transfer pump (sometiems also called a =93pre-pump=94) and a main pump, b=
ut I do=0Anot know for sure. ? 

Good Luck
