The Porsche factory and the museum are both in Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen, in
the southwestern part of Germany.  The address is:

	Porsche Museum
	Porschestr. 42
	7000 Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen 
	Germany

	Phone: 01149-711-827-5685

The above ZIP code for Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen is the old one.  The ZIP
codes in Germany changed after the reunification, however, I don't know the
new one.

The museum is open Mon. through Fri. 9:00-12:00 a.m. and 1:00-4:00 p.m.
There is no charge.  I believe that plant tours can be arranged with an
advance call (maybe only for groups).

I grew up 80 miles from Stuttgart and lived in Stuttgart for 3 years.
During that time, I never made it to the Porsche museum.  When I lived
there, I always thought: "Why go today, I can always go tomorrow".  Then I
moved.  I finally went to visit 1 1/2 years ago during a business trip
after I moved to the US.  

To be honest, I was a little disappointed.  The Porsche museum is no
comparison to the Mercedes museum (also in Stuttgart) and the BMW museum
(in Munich).  It is basically one room full of cars.  However, if you are
in the area, you should go.
