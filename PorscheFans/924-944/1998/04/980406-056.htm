     Hi Chris, sorry to hear about the unecessary DME swap.  Anyway, the 
     1.2 bar boost could be the 'limp home' mode activated for some error 
     detected by the self diagnostic system.  If one of the sensors feeding 
     info to the diagnostic system finds an error, the car will reduce 
     power to limit damage and to get you home.  Has anyone tried the blink 
     code tool?  If the limp home mode has been activated, the tool should 
     show something (although this is not always true).  
     
     As for the the car just stopping, this could be the ever popular 
     broken solder joint in the DME relay.  You may have this problem 
     simultaneously, which drives people diagnosing crazy.  Anyway, you may 
     have two problems.  Check the relay, it is easy.  Even if you have 
     lousy power, the car should start.
     
     
     good luck and good hunting!

     Hi,
     
     First of all thanks to Farzaan Kassam, Tim Richards, Bad Bob, David
     Ganapol and Hahnmgh63 (!) for great descriptions of how turbos work,
     likely problem areas and potential diagnostic approches.
     
     "The work so far has been undertaken at a generally well-respected UK
     independent Porsche specialist. The cause of it originally was that 
     the.......... I'm seeing the proprietor of Parrs on Monday morning so
     any further pointers would be real helpful."
     
     Thanks ... Chris.
