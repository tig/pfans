Hey Jad, this may be somewhat far fetched but I'm apt to think that you
should pry open the black plastic cover on the air flow meter and check
to see if the little phillips setting screw might have come loose. This
happened to me very recently. On a cold start in the morning, my car
would start up in one and idle just fine. But when asked to give forth
some power on a move off from standstill, she hesitated and was lacking
her normal feel of torque/power. After a bit of tinkering (something we
all know how to do!), I discovered that the same screw described before
had come loose. The trick is trying to figure out the correct relative
setting and this requires a "trial 'n' error" ordeal. You see, the wiper
arm is now in a different relative position to the actual position of
the air damper flapper thingy inside the air flow metering box. In
essence, it's telling the DME brain box to either enrichen or lean the
mixture to the injectors and incorrectly it may be in the cold, yet it
may be close to home as since when the engine reaches normal
temperature, it runs ok but still slightly lacking the torque/power that
we expect. Right now, I think mine is set too rich. I'm running through
a full tank of gas in about five days' of driving when it normally runs
through about seven to eight days' worth of normal driving in Miami. Hey
George or Clark, could you please give us a hand to help us reset the
wiper arm into synch w/ the air damper? Is there an easy trick to check
or some tell-tale marking to look for or do we have to slacken the
screw, readjust the wiper arm, check the throttle range and recheck?
Anybody else who has had some experience w/ this DME Motronic system is
welcome to submit their $0.02 worth. Every little bit helps. Thanks in
advance to all.
