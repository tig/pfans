OK, this one has me confused.  My recently acquired 1984 944 had a broken
mast on the power antenna, so I decided to replace it.  I removed the old
Hirshman unit and cut the wires going into it (red,white,black).

When I put the new one, (not a Hirshman), back in I used a multimeter on
the wires.  Black showed ground, white 7volt at accessary ??, and red
12volt at acessary.  Nothing was 12volt constant, so I ran a wire back to
the battery for that.  I hooked up the red to the switched 12 in on the
antenna, and the black to the ground on the antenna.

My antenna now goes up when I turn the key on, but will sometimes go down
on its own.  When I turn the air conditioning on the antenna goes down and
the engine cooling fan does not come on.  If I turn the AC off the antenna
goes back up again.  Also, when the car gets hot the engine cooling fans do
not turn on.

I tried pulling the two wires from the temp switch on the radiator like my
Hanes says to do.  I ran a wire between the two terminals but still no fan.
 After I hooked the wires back up though the fan worked once, but it
doesn't anymore.

What have I done?? Anyone have any ideas or maybe a wiring diagram that may
help me?  This is driving me crazy!  I know it's something simple, but I'm
gonna take it to the shop soon if I can't figure out what it is.

Thanks in advance for any help
Eric
