I wonder how much of an SUV would actually be Porsche's design.... 
Considering how different the design goals are for the current Porsche
niche of sports cars and what people expect from a Sport Ute.

I don't know how involved they were in the initial phases, but wasn't
Porsche initially in on the M-Class, then backed out when they couldn't
have some things there way?  I think their complaint was that the M-class
was turning more and more into a big station wagon, when what they had
hoped for was a sportier, more rugged vehicle, just as well suited for
off-road racing as hauling lumber and the kid's soccer team.  I kind of get
a chuckle at the thought of Porsche complaining a vehicle wasn't rugged
enough....  My experiences (as limited as they are) tend to tell me that
was never at the top of their list of design goals before.

I'm sure the story is told many ways, but that's how we heard it at Becker
when we were desigining some of the M-Class suspension pieces.
