For the first time since I bought my '87 944 na, it is giving me engine
troubles.  This problem are unlike any I have read on the list so I'll
through it out to you guys:

After doing some non-engine related work, the engine seems to miss fire;
or maybe more accurately, mis inject the fuel.  The spark plugs all come
out a pretty tan-gray.  Looks like the engine is burning right.  The
only thing that I have dinked with and shouldn't have :) is an aluminum
block with two sensors.  It is on top of the front bell housing and
bolts to the block.  The sensors point at the pins on the flywheel.
Does this control anything important? :)  Because I bent one of the
sensors (the rear most one).  Anyway, It runs great when the throttle is
past the resistance point, no miss.  It has no power (less than a normal
na) in the lower to mid throttle, and idles somewhat rough.  HOWEVER,
sometimes it runs fine through all throttle positions.  Note: throttle
position is pedal position, not RPM range.

My theory is the sensor I killed reads the engine speed.  If the car has
a rev./speed limiter,  the sensor may be sending a bad signal to the
computor and kicking in the rev./speed limiter.  That's what it feels
like to me.  Does the car have a rev./speed limiter? (No wife jokes)

Of course, I've checked the obvious.  Can't find any loose connections,
etc.  Any help will be appreciated as the car has been sentanced to the
shop on Friday (10).
