Hey there all,

I have a question for everyone out there.  Occasionally an odd, clicking
sound will come from the right-hand sound (supposing that you're sitting
inside) in the front of the car.  The sound comes and goes, more so in the
winter than now.  And what makes it even stranger is that the sound goes
away when the brake is pressed.  I finally found this little box that is
doing this.  When the hood is open, looking into it, on the left side
underneath the body code plate, is a small box with a cylinder attached to
it.  To the back is an elecrical cable.  Coming from it is a cable that
goes to the throttle.  When this cable is pulled, the throttle opens. 
However, when the throttle itself is moved either by pedal  or by hand, the
cable doesn't move.  Since this has been going on and off especially during
the winter months, I'm guessing that this is some sort of temperature
control.  Not only because of the temperature occurences but the fact that
this "thing" is indirectly controlled to the throttle.  Am I right? All
those that are knowledgeable in this sort of thing, please let me know what
it is what I can do about it.  Thanks in advance.

Dave
