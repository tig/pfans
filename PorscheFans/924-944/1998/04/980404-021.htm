Tim R. wrote in praising the excellent service he rec'd from Pioneer centers 
in san diego....I have not used them but have talked to several people who are 
also very happy with this dealer's service dept. 

HOWEVER,Tim, I do not share your opinion when you named  3 other shops in san 
diego and said they were "all scams". I will only comment on the shop that I 
have experience with, which is Black Forest... They have always taken good 
care of my 951. John has on more than one occasion talked me out of making 
certain modifications to the car.(even though it meant more revenue for his 
shop)  I have never had a higher level of trust with any automotive service 
shop that I have dealt with...Their close relationship with PCASD would not be 
happening if what you said had any merit.
Tim, there are times when cars break, shit happens, (even to Porsches) and 
it's not the repair shop's fault...

Sorry for the bandwith usage to all non so-cal residents
