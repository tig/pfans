Hi Clive,

Yes I had the exact problem with my '88 N.A., it was due to a warped head.
Unfortunately for me, I had just purchased the car when I found this out.
You will likley have to have your head milled to correct the problem. The
mechanic told me the situation was likely due to having been overheated at
some time, and aluminum being as soft as it is under heat....warpage.
