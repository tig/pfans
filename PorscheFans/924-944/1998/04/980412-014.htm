Folks,

A couple of recent postings on restoring damaged glass:

The Eastwood Company (www.eastwoodco.com) sells a kit ($32) for  
doing this.
It contains a polishing wheel and glass polishing compound.  I've bought
one under recommendation from another list member, but have yet to  
do the job.
I bought mine to relieve the same problem Gregor has.  Eastwood's catalog
(or web page) reads:

"Try this simple test: run your fingernail over the
damaged area on the windshield. If your nail does not get
caught on the scratch, then your windshield can be
renewed with this kit."

So - when I get a few hours, I'll try it out and report back to the list.
The glass shops I contacted would not do polishing -- said it takes too
long -- they all wanted to replace the windshield instead.
