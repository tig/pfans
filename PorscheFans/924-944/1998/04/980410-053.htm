Previously, I noticed a small piece of tubing coming out of the exhaust
pipe of my 1988 944 N/A.  It is located next to the O2 sensor, and on my
car it went straight up and ended in the middle of nowhere after approx. 45
cm (this would be 1 1/2 feet on an American car).  

A few days ago, the car sounded like it had developed an exhaust leak.
When I checked it out, I noticed that the little tube had broken off.  Can
I just plug the hole, or does that tube have a function?  Was it supposed
to be connected to something in the first place?

Different issue:  

It always amazes me how reliable 944s are.  I consider mine to be in good
condition, but all these nice things I keep hearing about keep happening to
my car like clock work.  The rubber center of the clutch was shot when I
bought the car.  Not knowing what exactly it was, I just assumed I could
fix it.  I assumed right, but I hadn't understood how involved the repair
job would be when I bought the car.  Just after I had put everything back
together, my waterpump started to leak, which I had fixed.  My cruise
control acts funny (brain shot, can anybody tell me where it is on the
car?), the rear wiper hasn't been working since I bought the car, and I
just discovered the hole in the battery tray (water leak).

I think it is safe to assume that sooner or later I have to replace the
engine mounts, do those seals in the radiator, etc.  I know all this has
been discussed on the list multiple times.  Due to the lack of time, I
ignored these discussions, though.  

When the time comes, I would like to look up these topics.  I do know about
the archives on porschefans.com.  However, when I checked out the archives,
I could only select the contributions by date.  Is there any way I can
search for certain topics?
