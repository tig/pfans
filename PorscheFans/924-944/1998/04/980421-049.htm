Just so that potential 951 owners don't get too freaked out, here are the
major items that cost a lot of money on my car.  Keep in mind this is in
C$ which is about C$1 * 0.70 to get a reasonable conversion to US money.

First set of wheels/tires w/trade-in (stupidest thing I did in a long time)
   $2197.00
Water pump/all belts prevent. maintenance
   $1300.00
Front brake rotors (old ones had big lip and near wear limit)
    $320.00 + $140 labour
New starter.  I think we could have just replaced the solenoid, but they
decided to replace the whole unit because it was under warranty.
    $807.00
New set of tires.  I don't like replacing pairs, I replace all at once.
Bought Potenza S-02 to replace the Dunlops.
   $1500.00
Rear axle and CV joints (both sides)
   $1000.00
Clutch hose + labour
    $300.00
Control arms (you can get Dynamic to rebuild them for US$300 or so)
   $3000.00
Head gasket replacement
   $1300.00

And now, we are at minumum looking at re&re of the block at 26 hours of
labour.  The best machinest in town will be looking at it to see if he
can work his magic with an insert.

Yes, owning these cars can be expensive, but if you search for the right
parts and have a decent shop, it can be alright.  Just don't get suckered
into things like I do.

I have a kart race this weekend where I will be 100% legal and will have
my balanced and blueprinted motor (like all my competition has) so 
hopefully the tables will turn for the better this weekend with a win :)

One thing that has come from all this block crap is that when my car is
back, I'm going to really use that car now.  I'll be damned if I'm not the
person to blow it up.  Never again will a shop be the ones to break my car
or discover a problem, I want to have fun blowing it up.  I'm going to go
to every PIR and SIR DE event I can fit between my kart racing.  No more
pussying around my baby, she's grown up now and ready to party!

I'm gonna get me some serious track pads and some serious rubber, some BIG
FAT 275's and am gonna go kick some air cooled butt (after I can save enough
money again of course!).
