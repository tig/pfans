In reply to the replacment of 944 rod bearings.  My 1985/1 944 which I
race in SCCA and PCA club events has about the same oil pressure as the
1984 you are looking at.  But by the end of a race it usually shows a
maximum of 3 bar @ 6000 rpms.  The car runs fine, but this has bothered
me since it started doing it over a year and a half ago.  Last winter
96-97 I changed rod bearings because some genius told me a 10% drop in
oil pressure means to change rod bearings.  Anyway, the old bearings
looked like brand new (car mileage-152k) but I changed them because I
had already bought new ones.  It was a waste of time because the oil
pressure  by the end of a race is 3 bar @ 6000 rpm.  I use Mobil 1 and
because the car still runs great, I'm going to try to quit worring about
it, and run the thing til she blows, and then buy a used engine from
George B. or someone else out of PorscheFans.  I'll keep you all posted.
