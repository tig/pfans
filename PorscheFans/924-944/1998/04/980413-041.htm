Alright, this is not exactly Porsche related but I have a question
regarding the use of a K&N cone filter that may help Porsche owners in
an indirect way.  Besides, I know some of you guys have used these
suckers before (pun intended), so I want to know what your opinions are.
I have a K&N cone that the PO mounted on my car (not a Porsche, a BMW).
He took off the top plastic cover to the stock airbox, and rested the
cone (using stock hose plumbing to manifold) on top of the bottom half
of the airbox.  There is a snorkel leading to this bottom half of the
airbox, and it draws cooler air from between the headlights when the car
is moving.  Otherwise, it is obviously drawing warm engine compartment
air.  Now I'm not looking for any performance gains, and I assume I'm
losing a few hp by combusting hot air anyway, but I'm concerned about
any engine life or reliability problems I may encounter by continuing to
use this cone filter the way it is currently setup.  I'm figuring the
temperature of the intake air now can't possibly be any hotter than the
air being used in a turbocharged engine (even with an intercooler),
right?  So is hot air necessarily bad for the engine itself, if not
ideal for performance?  I have bought some aluminum flashing to build my
own heat shield, but I'm hoping you guys will convince me that this is
not required.

Thanks,
Ben
