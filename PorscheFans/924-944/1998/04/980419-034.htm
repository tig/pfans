On a brighter and less worrisome note, I am definitely getting faster.
Moroso is very different than Sebring in that it has two turns shaped like
oxbows.That is they are more than 180 degrees and Sebring has nothing
comparable. Street tires (at least my street tires) just don't seem to cut it. 

There were a number of 944s all using Yokohama 032Rs. All said that they
would last longer than R1s and would be almost as good. Any seconds?

Also ready to do a little modification. I think lowering my car is of
primary importance. Secondly I thought a strut brace would be a good idea
(any suggestions on brands?). I'm not ready to do any power mods as I don't
think I'm yet capable of using more power.

Thanks again for all the good advice. It really cuts the learning curve down.
