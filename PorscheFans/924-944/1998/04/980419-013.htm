I'm in Orlando.  You close to here?  Anyway, have you bled the system
correctly?  When putting in the new coolant and water, open the bleed
valve (lets air out while coolant goes in).  Once full, start the car
with the heater on full, let it warm up (coolant cap on, bleeder open)
until water is coming out of the bleeder with NO air in it.  That means
it will spew out of there for a minute or so, but just keep letting it
come out until there is no air bubbles with it.  I've done it several
times to my 85.5 944 and it's fairly simple.  If I don't do it this way
it runs at or near the 3/4 mark, but now it runs on the 1/4 mark all the
time, air on, sun out...foot on the floor....  1/4 mark.

Other considerations.  Water pump?  How old is it?  I just changed mine
a couple months ago  :*(   Fun, but not easy.  Fans, do they both come
on?  If not, suspect a sensor.  Radiator?  Hmmm   could be.

> Hello Porsche Fans,

> AAAHHHHH!!
