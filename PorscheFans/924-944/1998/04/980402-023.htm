Think about how you unsubscribe.  one method is through the web page, where
you jsut supply your e-mail address and tell it you want to leave.  And
you're unsubscribed.  The listserver WILL send you a confirmation e-mail,
though, so oyu will know the moment oyu are unsubscribed.

The other way is via e-mail, and I'm not sure you can still
subscribe/unsubscribe that way on Pfans, haven't tried.  Most list servers
will check the address the request is coming from, and only follow through
if it matches the e-mail address being unsubscribed.  That being said, it's
easy enough to make your mail come from any address you want, working
aorund that safety feature.

Once again, a confirmation e-mail will be sent in either of these cases.

The only real safe way around it it to require use of passwords in changing
your list status.
