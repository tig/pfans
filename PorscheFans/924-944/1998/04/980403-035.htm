Thanks for everyone's response to the loose 1986 Turbo 951 problem. After
taking the car to a frame/alignment shop (very reputable from what I hear)
the rear of the car has lots of problems.

The rear tires toe out almost 2" .  The drivers side has -3/8" camber and
the pass side has -1/2" camber.  The front of the car is ok..There are no
visible signs of anything bent or broken. All the bushings look good.  It
seems that the car has been hit in the past.  The alignment shop knows there
is some adjustment in the rear, but they assured me that they would not be
able to correct 2" of toe out (no wonder the car was all over the place at
speed).

The alignment shop  said that they could put the car on the frame rack and
bend the trailing arms into correct specifications.  Is this true?  They
said that they do this for Porsches and Mercedes all the time.

How much adjustment is there in the rear?

How much do used aluminum trailing arms cost?  About....

There are no problems with the bearings.  It's kinda weird. Everything looks
great with the suspension, pick up points, mounts, etc...

They estimated that the rack time/re-alignment time would come to about
$550US

They said it would take about a full day.

Does this sound correct?
Should I bother with having them straighten out the car or should I replace
the trailing arms?

Thanks for everything guys.
