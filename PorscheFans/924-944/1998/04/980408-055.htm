The PM of my recently purchased 944 continues; the engine mounts are next=
=2E =

The mount on the exhaust side is definitely bad.  The lock nuts actually
touch the lower pad surface. I have purchased a pair of late model mounts=

which seem much thicker; any advice?  Can I change one at a time?  I
usually loosen the mounts and jack the engine off the mounts with a floor=

jack.  I fear using the pretty aluminum pan as a jack point; just where i=
s
the best jack point?  Must I remove any items other than the mounts?

This is my first Porsche; the car is even more robust than the old Bimmer=

it replaces.  Why did I wait so long to buy one of these things?  Oh well=
,
I have been a car nut for over 30 years always doing my own work.  I
maintain my cars the same way I do my airplane, that is, fix it before it=

breaks!  My neighbors think I am crazy to do my own work, much less fix
things before something lets go.  I think they do not appreciate
preventative maintenance versus breakdown maintenance.  Come to think of =
it
they do no maintenance at all.  They simply dump their lease car every tw=
o
years.

Still crazy after all these years, and thanks in advance.
