     I have two current issues with my car, one minor, one maybe major and 
     as I cannot come to a resolution, I will throw them out for the 
     group's input.
     1.  When I bought my car, the air conditioning did not work.  As it 
     has recently become warm, I had the air fixed.  This included a new 
     receiver/dryer and expansion valve and,of course, disassembling half 
     the dash.  Anyway, when the air is on, I hear a clicking sound coming 
     from under the dash/steering wheel area.  It follows no discernible 
     pattern.  The time between clicks is anyway from 15 seconds to a 
     minute, but the random clicking can drive you crazy.  I've tried to 
     adjust vent conditions and it makes no difference.  Turn off the air, 
     and the clicking stops.  Any ideas would really be appreciated, this 
     is driving me crazy.
     2.  This is more major.  The gasket that connects the upper radiator 
     hose elbow to the block recently began leaking, so I replaced it.  
     This caused some anti-freeze mixture to leak onto the block.  What 
     happened is that the car starting smoking.  It smells like burnt 
     anti-freeze.  I assumed it was just spilled anti-freeze burning off 
     the block from the leak.  This however, has not stopped.  The smoke 
     seems to be coming up from under the exhaust manifold on cylinder 
     number 1.  It is not coming from the water pump which was my first 
     suspect since it was recently replaced.  This is driving my crazy as I 
     cannot find any leak, the car does not run hot, and it's embarrassing 
     to sit at a stop light with smoke coming from under my hood, besides 
     the smell is driving my crazy.  The gasket that mounts the manifold to 
     the motor does seem to have a small leak as it is a little oily while 
     the other three have dry gaskets, but there is no seeping oil or 
     anything and I don't see how antifreeze could be burning off the 
     bottom of this manifold.  The hose to  the heater core is not leaking 
     on the manifold either.
     
     Any advice as always is greatly appreciated, this list is a life 
     saver, I wish I could meet and thank everyone who has provided help in 
     the past.
     
     TIA,
