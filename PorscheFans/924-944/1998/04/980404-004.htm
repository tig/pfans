Jack at Jim Ellis does indeed rule- super nice, he helped me fix my oil
pressure relief valve for free- but otherwise, it's still a dealer...

try a place called Franz Blam racing on US 29, I found it tough to get an
appointment since they are primarily a race shop and mostly take on the
high ticket 911 repairs, but they raced 944 and 968 models for a long
time... they are real porsche enthusiasts and the shop is a really cool
little place if you like fast cars...

Franz Blam Racing

another possibility is that I have the ridiculous tool and do the belts on
my 1987 944NA... I could possibly be persuaded to run over and help you
tension the belt, for say... some of those four packs of Guiness in the
can...

no snickering, the canned Guiness is the best product on the planet... real
head and the crazy cascading fizz of the delicious authentic beverage... I
gotta stop this, I have not even had breakfast yet...
