The windscreens exist and are even origianl Porsche parts! Most dealers
don't know about these, but Sonnen Porsche in San Francisco (don't have
phone # right here, but they are on the web) has them. I bough mine from
them for somewhere in the $350-400 range. The screen installs in less than
five minutes with NO modifications to your car.

THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST MONEY I'VE SPENT ON MY CAB SO FAR!

The difference is incredible. The screens look exactly like the ones you see
on newer 911s and BMWs.

If you don't have one for you cab you MUST buy one. You'll wonder how you
could have been without it once you have it.

As always, I'm not affiliated with Sonnen Porsche and I don't get comission
from them (I wish I did - I've been recommending these screens to a lot of
people!). Sonnen just happened to have an ad in Excellence that caught my
attention.

Happy Motoring,
