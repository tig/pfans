     I have a '86 944T and after attending promotive driving school realize
that the brake bias on my car is too far forward.  Rears hardly got warm after
hard stops and fronts locked up.  Heard the '86 and earlier 944's had the 18/5
proportioning valve and the '87 and later cars were switched to the 33/5
valve.  Anyone know what I'm talking about or experience similar problems.  I
have carbon pads with drilled rotors all around.  I've rebled the rear circuit
thinking there may have been air in it to no avail.  Any help would be
appreciated.  MGH >>
