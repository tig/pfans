I had this problem too, on an '86 951 when it was nearly new; the fan
thermostat switch failed "on".  I'm having a similar problem of fan run-on
now so I'm replacing the switch yet again, for about $10-15.

The switch is located on the radiator, driver's side near the top.  Access
is best from the bottom of the car after pulling the pan(s).  It's hard to
reach with a tool - I used an open-end adjustable plier to loosen it and
then unscrewed it by hand.  The process dumps a bit of coolant so you'll
need to refill & carefully bleed the system afterwards.

Probably the temp switch.  At least it's cheaper to replace.  Pulling the
G10 breaks the circuit to the fans, but doesn't demonstrate that the G10 is
bad.  Not positive on this, but I don't think the G10 can activate the fans
without input (= closed circuit) from the temp switch, even tho it gets
input from several sources.
