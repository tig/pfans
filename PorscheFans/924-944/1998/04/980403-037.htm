Anybody have any recommendations on where to get a control arm?  There was a
bulge in the grease boot on the ball joint of one of the my control arms.  I
removed the grease boot and found out that a piece of the plastic bushing(?)
around the spindle had been broken.  The control arm ball joint is not loose,
and doesn't show any signs of wear, however I don't exactly know the purpose of
this plastic piece and am in the market for a new or used control arm.

Has anyone had any luck having their ball joints rebuilt?

Also, the cheapest place I can find a control arm for the M030 cars is Brumos
Porsche who quoted me 650.00.  Any other places?

Thanks in advance!!!

chris
