In response to Peter Dikeman's post.

I got approx 20+ rear wheel HP(dynoed) after install MAF sensor and
chips.  I can
also feel the difference.  The theoretical advantage is flow and very
obvious, after
seeing the MAF sensor installed and listening to the turbo spool up.

================================================

Peter, I concur with Randall.  Although I have not had a chance to
dyno the car since installing the MAF, there is unquestionably an
increase in power even though I went to a smaller turbo and (just my
$.02) more importantly, a BIG increase in driveability.

As respects why the MAF would make more power (I'm not a mechanic so
don't flame me!), I think it has to do with the outdated type of
airbox in the stock car.  By moving to the MAF or a "hot wire" system,
the computer can better gauge the incoming airflow and adjust the A/F
quicker as opposed to the "flapbox" system which is like a door that
it is either opening or closing.  Keep in mind that the factory moved
to the "hot wire" system a number of years ago...

Again, I'm not a mechanic, just my understanding of how the system
works.  Anyone out there have a more technical explanation?  Jim? 
Ralph?  Farzaan?  Randall?
