    Rodney,  I could forward a copy to you, but do you have the viewer and know
how to use it?
You can get it from dynojets web site with instructions but still a little bit
tricky.  Last time I dynoed
at about 300HP and 290 Torque.  Let me know if you still want the files, I'll
send them. This was
at 1.2 bar boost.

  I have quite a few mods and am not finished yet.  Since my dyno I have
installeda ProFec Boost controller which I'm still trying to debug, and Nology
wires.  I have
an aftermarket coil and MSD ignition I haven't installed yet but plan to as
soon as I get
time.  My other mods are the head work, E-H manifold, rising rate Fuel Pressure
reg
3.8 bar adjustable, MFS, Larger bore throttle body, ProFec boost gauge, Bursch
Cat
bypass, and K-27 DR.  I'm hoping to see 315 to 320 HP on my next dyno.  I made
max power on my
last dyno at about 5500 and the power fell off rapidly to about 6500 but I
think I was
starving for fuel and have since added the larger adjustable regulator.

  The ProFec is being troublesome.  When it was first installed it would boost
no lower
than 1.15 bar max.  I could adjust it up but not down.  I made some changes in
the way I
installed it and can now adjust it for pretty much any boost I want, but as
soon as it hits
max boost the boost drops back almost immediately to .5 bar or so.  I'm going
to reinstall
it the way I had it the first time and try to get tighter connections with
shorter lines between
the boostbolt and GReddy stepper motor through the boost control valve to
wastegate and
hopefully I will get more pressure to wastegate and it should open at a lower
boost.  If you
followed that you understand how the boost controls work pretty well, if you
didn't it doesn't
really matter.  I may end up having to go with an aftermarket wastegate but I'm
going to try
to get it to work with the stock one first.

   I love my MFS and it was worth every penny.  I find it hard to believe but I
paid a lot less than
I thought I would for the MFS.  I had paid $100 for the K27 chip upgrade from
Autothority and I sent the chips back when I got the MFS chips.  They refunded
my $100 and sent me back new Stage 2 chips which I
may sell(not sure, I may want to keep and put back in car if I sold car and
sell MFS separate).  I only
paid $1450 for the MFS new.  If your car flows really well the MFS is worth
it.  I think you need K-27
and Cat by-pass.  The HP figures don't tell it all, the MFS is great but I
think you really need at least
those mods for it to really work well.  The name of the game is flow.  As soon
as I finish installing the
MSD and coil and get the PRofec working right I'm going to redyno(I'm also
going to install a small lamda
gauge and try to dial in my fuel pressure as best as I can) and will probably
try some different pressures
on the dyno to see which gives the best HP.

Good luck,
Randall Morton
