If you were braking very hard or trail-braking, you may have felt the ABS
kicking in -- you probably would have heard some tire chirping as well.  It's
also possible that your rotors are warping when hot, but returning to true
when they cool down.
Make sure your wheel lugs are evenly torqued to spec.

You'll probably hear a bunch of opinions about this.  My advice is to purge
the system completely at the start of the DE season, bleed the brakes between
events, and repurge every couple of months; more often if you detect any
sponginess in the pedal.  In the scheme of things, brake fluid is cheap and
well worth the reassurance it provides when fresh.  I'm not sure what you mean
by "heavy duty."
Use a high quality fluid with a high boiling point (I use ATE, but there are
others out there that are equally good.  I've heard Ford sells an inexpensive
truck fluid with a high boiling point.).
 
<< How frequently should oil be changed when using the car for events. I am

Again, get ready for lots of advice!  FWIW, I use 15W-50 synthetic and change
it frequently (no more than 3K miles or 3 months) -- another form of cheap
insurance.
