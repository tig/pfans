Hello David,

> Back from a day at Moroso a 2.25 mile track near West Pakm Beach Florida.

Good for you. I hope you had fun.

> Unfortunately my brake problems continue. As the day wore on the brakes

How did the rotors look? Did you examine them when you were having 
problems? Did you see anything wrong with them?

> severe pulsation in the brakes. I'm really stumped. If I have to do over the
> brakes fine, but if it is something to do with the suspension, I don't want

That's very strage for sure. I have never experienced shimmy or anything
like that. Well, I have experienced shimmy, but it was because of 
unbalanced tires, and it was consistant, etc.

> to do the brakes for nothing. I also noticed that I get about four times as
> much brake dust on the fronts as on the rears. Any ideas?

That's normal. The rear brakes on these cars don't do anything. I go
through front pads about 5 times faster than rear pads. Some people
have changed the brake bias valve to get more rear braking, but I
haven't.
 
> I think that I definitely should try new pads. Help!!! TIA

That's probably a good idea. Depending on how motivated you are, and on
how you use your car, either use dedicated race pads for the track and
change them for the street, or use Hawk HPS or something like that.
 
> On a brighter and less worrisome note, I am definitely getting faster.

That's good. There's no replacement for experience.

> comparable. Street tires (at least my street tires) just don't seem to cut it. 

Street tires are good to learn on. You won't go as fast, so you're less likely
to get in serious trouble, and they are easy to control at the limit, and they
give more feedback. However, compared to competition rubber, good street tires
cost more. And in hot weather, full tread depth street tires will overheat and
start to chunk.

> There were a number of 944s all using Yokohama 032Rs. All said that they
> would last longer than R1s and would be almost as good. Any seconds?

Well, they will last longer. They are not almost as good. They're quite a bit
slower than R1's. However, for anything other than racing, they work well.
Being that you're not concerned (yet) with removing the last second from
each lap. the A032R would be a good tire choice.

> Also ready to do a little modification. I think lowering my car is of

That's a good idea but don't overdo it or you risk breaking a ball joint.
Other's can give you exact ride height info.

> primary importance. Secondly I thought a strut brace would be a good idea

What do you think a strut brace is going to do? Do you really think that
on street tires, or even DOT competition tires, that you can generate enough
corner loads to actually twist the car chassis and affect your suspension
geometry? The answer is NO WAY. For a street car, a strut brace is not
going to do a thing. Now, if you use real sticky tires, replace all rubber
bushings with solid or eurothane bushings, and install stiff swaybars,
THEN a strut brace MIGHT do something. Until then, save your money for
something that will do something.

> (any suggestions on brands?). I'm not ready to do any power mods as I don't
> think I'm yet capable of using more power.

Good attitude. 

Sermon on:

My opinion, if you're ready to make some changes to the
car, there is, without a doubt, something you should do first. Install
a set of 5 or 6 point harnesses. You can install them without drilling
holes if that's something that concerns you. As you know by now, a 944
turbo is a VERY fast car. If you have an incident, it can be at a very
high rate of speed. The stock seat belts and air bags will not do enough
to protect you. If you get serious about track driving, you should have
a proper driving harness. Safety first, then performance mods.

Sermon off

> Thanks again for all the good advice. It really cuts the learning curve down.

It sure does. And that holds true at every level.
