Why yes, just recently I have become quite familiar with these parts! (but
thats another story) The sensor housing should unscrew from the base with
out significant force. It is just a plastic piece so I wouldn't beat on it
too hard. Mine came lose with a small amount of force on a wrench. The
plastic device is where the mechanical rotation is changed to the electrical
signal. I would be suprised if that is where the problem is, I would guess
that they either work or don't, failure in the Speedo itself is more common.
If I recall correctly the pulse generator cannot be disassembled easily, if
the problem is in that area and not in the dash I would suspect corrosion on
the cable that you have already disconnected. If you have any symptoms I may
be of further help.
