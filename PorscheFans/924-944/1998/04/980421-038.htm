I repaired my battery box, which had two holes one to the inner fender
and one to the passenger footwell, by cleaning the area thoroughly with
water and baking soda. To do it right the glovebox and airbag brains
must be removed. After everthing is cleaned I coated both sides of the
damaged area with POR 15 from Auto Atlanta. This is a two step process,
one is a primer/etcher and the other is the sealing paint. I applied
three coats of the paint. Then I installed two layers of fiberglass over
just the holes, overlap a couple of inches, and let that cure. Then I
coated the entire battery box with the battery box spray that Automotion
sells. So far so good! The secret to stopping rust is to seal the air
out. Other than the battery box being black instead of dark blue you
can't tell it was repaired. Just my .02.
