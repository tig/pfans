I know some of you guys have hitch receivers on your 944 for tire trailers
and the like.  My question is where did you get them?  All the dealers
around here say none exist, and since there is no frame to go to, where is
it mounted to?  Draw-tite doesn't list any models for the 944 and neither
did the dealer.  Are they all custom made?   Thanks in advance, Mike

Mike:
        I have a hitch on my 85.5 944 and, sorry to say, it is a custom job.
Never fear, however, as it is rather easy for any shop that knows what they
are doing.  My hitch mounts with two bolts to the bottom of the bumper, then
a piece extends toward the front of the car to the outside of the spare
tire-well under the car.  Here it is attached with four screws with lock
washers to the spare tire-well.  Inside the well the four bolts that attach
do not interfere with the spare.  The lights are spliced into the wiring
inside the rear hatch behind the carpeting.  I remove the license plate
light and feed the wiring through the hole when I use the trailer.  I have a
tire trailer that holds 2 sets of tires and a gang box.  I have never had a
problem with the hitch or with pulling the load.  Let me know if you would
like more info.
