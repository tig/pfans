     Hi Robert, i have the tire combo you are talking about.  I have the 
     Fuchs wheels with 7/8 inch widths.  It should be dimensinally the same 
     as the phone dials.  I have had Pirelli P700s, Bridgestone Re71s, and 
     now Continental SportContacts (the new ones).  The I like the 
     Sportcontacts the best for a lot of reasons.  They were the quietest, 
     smoothest ride and lowest cost.  They are also made in Germany!  Also, 
     the 225s on the front is a tight fit but the Sportcontacts have an 
     inset ridge so that the tire sidewalls are stright up and down.  The 
     Bridegstones had a slight 'bulge'.  I think the new Pirellis have the 
     inset feature.  The bridgestones were particularly bad on flatspotting 
     overnight.  All tires flatspot overnight but how quickly they recover 
     when you start driving is the criteria to be examined.  The first 15 
     to 20 minutes of driving for the Bridgestones were 'thumpy'.  The 
     Continentals seem much better.  I measured the flatspot in the morning 
     on the Continentals and it was around 0.050" over about 7" of 
     circumference.  The other thing to note is that steering effort will 
     be higher for the 225 on the front.  The '86 951s (i have one) seem to 
     be more sensitive to wheel shimmy so bigger tires may exasserbate 
     balance problems.  If you have shimmy go for an on-car balance.  By 
     the way i think the '86 are BETTER in steering feel if everthing is 
     working ok!  They have suspension geometries that are different from 
     the 87+ cars.  They are also lighter in the suspension department and 
     overall.  
     
     '86s UNITE!

     Ok, friends, simple , you're experience and knowledge is appreciated:
     
     I currently have 205/225 X 16's on my '86 951.  AVS Intermediates.
     Fiance needs new tires on her Beretta w/ 16" wheels.  Presto, give her
     the AVS's, get new, wider tires for me!
     
     Rapid Fire qeustions:
     
     Does anyone have experience with 225/245 setups with 16" Phone Dials, 
     7
     X 8 by 16"?
     Are these too wide?
     Will there be too much "overhang" on the rim?
     What is the widest/best all around tire combination for, um,
     occasionally agressive street use?
     
     Thanks all!
