Hello
	
	The reason why two different keys can or will work the the same lock cylinder
is that the tumblers will wear down, so two different key patterns might work!
Most car keys are made out of steel, the lock cylinders are made from soft
brass. The lock cylinders do wear down! Try replacing or rather rebuilding the
lock cylinders tumblers and odering new steel keys from Porsche (about $25)
ordered from the cars VIN#.

	I had a friend who drove the wrong car home (Rabbit GTi) from a late night
party one night. His key worked fine in the door and ignition! It was only
when he got home he could not find his garage remote control cliped to the
passanger sunvisor, then when he got out of the car he noticed the car was the
wrong color!! Needless to say he contacted the owner thru the registration
papers and got his car back. The other drive too had no problem starting the
"other" car!

	Also using a good high quality lube in the door locks will prevent wear. I
use Wurth HSS-2000 or you can use a good graphite spray in the lock cylinders.

Good Luck
David

Subject: Wierd lock problem... thoughts?

Any thoughts from the collective before I rip into my door, and maybe
ground my baby for a while?

I think it happened this winter.. I needed to get something out of my 83
944... and the key turned kinda hard in the driver's door lock.  Well..
by accident.. (it was dark).. I put the wrong key into the door.. and it
unlocked!!  Umm.. I don't want to have the car so accessable by anyone
with any type of key.

What could have happened?  Is the handle trashed.. or perhaps just a
damaged lock that some locksmith could repair?

TIA...
