I've got an '87 951 with the Autothority Stage II chip.  I'm fairly =
pleased with the performance improvement over the stock setup.  I'm now
=
thinking of bigger and better things.  What's the word on the street =
about the best next performance upgrade?  Is it a hot wire mass air
flow =
sensor?  A bigger turbo?  When I make the next jump are there any other
=
engine mods that need to be made to be able to take the additional =
power?  I am on a limited budget so stroker kits and other engine =
rebuilds are not in the picture.  Any advice would be great!!!

==========================================

Chris:

The next upgrade is certainly going to be a matter of some debate and
of course the old adage applies:  "Speed costs money, how fast do you
want to go?".

Personally, I would first make sure that your car is in a good state
of tune (including no vacuum leaks) and running synthetic oil in the
motor and tranny.  A K&N cone filter might yield a few hp and help the
intake side of the equation.

After that, I would put a cat bypass pipe in  (illegal - be careful!)
which will help reduce turbo lag and increase exhaust flow.  

Next, I think that moving to a "S" turbo as opposed to jumping to the
next larger K-27T6 might be beneficial.  A used S turbo can be found
for $400 or so (on exchange) while a rebuilt unit will cost a few
hundred more.  You will also need to swap chips to take advantage of
the better breathing of the bigger turbo - usually $250 or so on
exchange.  This upgrade will give you probably another 20 hp and a
much stronger top-end with a minor increase in lag (offset by the cat
bypass pipe).

The MAF could be your next step but this is rather expensive ($1,450 -
$1,650) and the benefits are currently being debated on the list (I
personally am very happy with this upgrade).

If you decide to run more than 1.1 bar boost, I would suggest picking
up a Bosch rising rate fule regulator from Windward ($179) to help
reduce the chance of detonation.  The simplest thing to do to increase
power is crank up the boost but keep in mind that too much boost can
have catastrophic results!!!

After these upgrades, any increase in flow, whether intake or exhaust,
is helpful.  Some options here are a bigger exhaust, Extrude-Honed
head/manifold, etc..

Good luck!!
