Could this be a case of not using anti-seize during original/last =
assembly?  There was a thread awhile back about torque settings and =
using anti-seize.  I think the outcome was that 80lbs of torque was more =
than 80lbs when using an anti-seize compound.  I have never taken the =
head off of mine but need to soon and would be interested on the ruling =
of anti-seize on head studs.

Thanks!

Hello,
  Been away from the list for a few days. I picked up on the thread on
Farzaan's head stud problem and figured I throw in my two cents worth.
By the way sorry to hear about the problems Farzaan.
  Correct me if I'm wrong Farzaan but, it sounds like your head studs
stripped out during the nut torquing and not during a head stud
installation. If this is the case, what was applied to the block end of
the thread would have little bearing on the stud pulling out of the
block. Don't get me wrong here because anti-seize should never be used
in the installation of either the head studs or the head bolts -- period.
While some people believe that locktite should be applied to the block
end of the head studs, Raceware specifically recommends against it.
What they do recommend is the application of a small amount of pipe
thread sealant. Application of locktite (or pipe thread sealant) allows
the cylinder head nuts to be removed without backing the stud out of
the block. Raceware has found that pipe thread sealant provides enough
counter torque to allow the cylinder head nuts to be removed without
the studs backing out which makes the studs much easier to remove down
the road if needed. Anti-seize applied to the block end of the threads
would allow the studs to back out when the cylinder head nuts are
removed.
   As far as the nut end of the head stud, the only thing that should be
applied to the threads is a small amount of engine oil.   It is possible
that if anti-seize was applied to the cylinder head end of the threads,
an excessive amount of torque could have been applied to the stud causing
it to be pulled out of the block.
   I'll throw out some theory on the original equipment head studs here
for the list to discuss. This is based on reading the section on
stretch bolt theory on the Raceware home page. According to Raceware,
stretch bolts (which applies to the 944 head studs) permanently stretch
and do not return to their original configuration when the torque is
removed. This is Raceware's basis for recommending that stretch bolt
should never be reused. While I am somewhat skeptical of this contention
(in that it would only help Raceware sell more head stud kits) the
theory is actually quite sound. If this is true, it is possible
that attempting to torque a previously torqued stretch bolt
(i.e. 944 head studs) to original specifications might exceed the
acceptable torque for the aluminum threads in the block. The same
problem could arise if you attempted to torque non-stretch bolts
(i.e. Raceware studs) using the factory procedure for stretch bolt
torquing. Of course, this is only a theory. I also realize that many
people have reused 944 head studs with no problems (myself included).
Based on Farzaan's problem, I may consider not reusing 944 head studs
again.


My two cents,
Clark Fletcher
