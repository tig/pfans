Hi All,

Wow there sure is passion on this list :-)

Anyway - I still may be wrong but WTH!


"When more than one force acts on different parts of a body, there is the
possibilty that, ,instead of or as well as, producing motion in the
direction of the resultant force, the body will be rotated. The torque or
moment of a force is a measure of the turning affect of a force at a point.
It is equal to the magnitude of the force multiplied by the perpendicular
distance of the point from the line of action of the force. T = F * r Hence
the dimensions of torque are [M]1 [L]2 [T]-2. Values of moment are given a
+/- value depending on whether they tend to produce clockwise or
anticlockwise rotation. " So when we use a torque wrench we apply a
rotational force over a distance until the system is in equilibrium and we
stop increasing the force - I.E. the wrench clicks or the beam hit a
number... One of the forces that is opposing the force we are applying is
the frictional component of the bolt/nut assuming there is room for things
to move. If we eliminate this component all things changes.
