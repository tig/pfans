All:

As promised, I am reporting on my experience installing Turbo S Koni front
struts/springs and rear Konis in place of the stock setup on my S2.  It was
fairly easy, taking about a day, and has made a big difference already, even
though I have yet to have the car professionally aligned.

First of all, a large thank you to list member Steve Meltzer, who sold me the
parts.  They were absolutely as-represented, and arrived promptly.  So far, I
have had extraordinarily good results buying parts from the folks on the list.
Also, to those of you who don't know him, Steve is a very funny guy.

I had planned on adding Camberballs to the front end.  I bought a set from OG
Racing, but will have to send them back.  First of all, the instructions for
these parts say you just need to "push" the rubber bushing from the strut
mounting plate, then install the Camberballs in place of the rubber.  Well,
guess what?  The rubber is BONDED to the plate, and is an absolute, crushing
PITA to remove.  I had to cut the bearing out with an air chisel, then use a
wire brush on a drill to remove the rest of the rubber.  Once all of this was
done, I found that the Camberballs do  not fit the S2 strut plate
properly--they are too small, so the retaining ring falls right through the
hole in the plate.  I had to use the stock S2 spring plates to reassemble the
car today.  Hopefully, OG Racing just sent me the wrong parts.  I have heard
good things about them, so I'm sure they'll make it right.

Other than that, the installation was pretty straightforward, although you do
need a coil spring compressor to do this job safely.  I cranked in as much
negative camber up front as the stock setup allows, and set the fronts to full
soft for starters, since even at this setting, they were much firmer than the
stock Sachs shocks I pulled out.  I set the rear Konis a turn and a half
toward full firm, since this approximated the feel of the rears I took put.  I
also took the opportunity to lower the rear of the car by adjusting the
eccentric on the rear torsion bar plate.  This brought the rear down nearly an
inch.

On a test blast through some of my favorite roads, all this transformed the
car, to the extent that I'm considering skipping the Camberballs entirely.
The car tracks SO much better, and feels a lot more composed over bumps, with
no noticeable change in ride quality.  In fact, a peculiar harmonic inside the
car that had caused a buzz from somewhere above my left ear (sunroof?) is now
gone.  Plus the cool looking adjustable spring perches almost make up for the
purchase price alone, although I'm not sure how you adjust the jamb nits on
the perches.  Does this require yet another special Porsche tool?

Bottom line:  if you are looking to upgrade the S2, I highly recommend this
change over the alternative of buying replacement Koni struts made
specifically for the S2, which are becoming increasingly hard to find.  You
get stiffer and more commonly sized springs, plus height adjustability, for a
used price that will likely be far less than the S2 spec Konis.

Next up--Pagids and 968 M030 front sway bar.
