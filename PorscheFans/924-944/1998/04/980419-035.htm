 In the event my car needs work performed beyond my

Alex -

I live in Houston and have owned my 944 for 9 months.  I have taken my car
to Eurocar-Werk at 5103 Gulfton since I bought it, and they do a nice job.
I'm not super knowledgeable about things mechanical, but I feel like they
are honest with me, quote me good prices, and do good work on my car.

Since I bought the car, they have performed work like timing belt/water pump
replacements, control arm/ ball joint replacements, and various sundry
repairs.  They always a tell me what's going on and call me before doing any
repair, and they have warned me about impending disasters before they occur
(eg, replacing the timing belt with 43k miles on it which the previous owner
had neglected).

All in all, I am satisfied with their work.  As an added bonus, they
apparently do performance upgrades as well.

Good luck,

Joseph Mitro
