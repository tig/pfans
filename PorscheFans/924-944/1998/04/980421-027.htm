Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop riding a bike.
Sheesh, what a week!  Payed taxes, paid $636 for various
spring fixes on the 951, bought wheels that didn't fit,
then yesterday the car started overheating
(waaaah!).  Ok, during normal on road driving, the temperature
is a little higher than normal, but when you stop or are in traffic
it heats up fast.  The fans run, the heater blows hot air, there
is plenty of coolant and no leaks or antifreeze smell, it just keeps
getting hotter.
Any idea folks?  I don't want to have to buy Farzann's old
block here.
Must be a 951 virus going around.

Coolant leak!  Bridge, we've got a coolant leak down
here, there's nothing I can do about it.  You're looking
at five minutes to a warp-core breach!
