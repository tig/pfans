Hi,

Just thought I'd query the list and see if anyone other than Terry Thomas
has experienced failure of either or both of the water hose fittings that
are pressed into the throttle body on the S2 (and probably others).  =
Terry
has had the honor of two such failures, one of which occurred at speed at
Portland Intl Raceway today... makes those rear tires *really* slick :-(

Because of his failure today, Terry has advised me to check my fittings =
and
if any of them feel the least bit loose, to pull them and epoxy them back
into place.  Does this sound like a prudent thing to do?  Have others
experienced failures of this type, or could they be germane to '89 S2s =
like
Terry's.

Thanks,
