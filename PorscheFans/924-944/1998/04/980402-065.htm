A long time ago I asked the same question and a great man gave me a cool
idea.  Use two pieces of twine or wire and attach one end to the glovebox,
the other end to the door, one for the left side and one for the right. 
Worked like a charm till I sold my 944S. BTW, the man was George B.  A
toast to you, George. 

Another suggestion on this list has been to cut two Js out of metal.

I have seen the circles on the glovebox doors of many other cars, indeed
they are cupholders, but not in the US of A sense.  They are appropriate
holders for situations when the vehicle is parked, ie drive-in theaters.
Here in the US of A we like to drink and drive (coffee, soft drinks, etc)
and given the performance potential of the 944, these cup holders are
useless for such applications.
