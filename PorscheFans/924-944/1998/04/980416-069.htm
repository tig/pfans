Could this be a case of not using anti-seize during original/last =
assembly?  There was a thread awhile back about torque settings and =
using anti-seize.  I think the outcome was that 80lbs of torque was more =
than 80lbs when using an anti-seize compound.  I have never taken the =
head off of mine but need to soon and would be interested on the ruling =
of anti-seize on head studs.

Thanks!
Mark

Hello,

Spent some time at the shop last night figuring out what happened.  I =
saw
the head stud, about 1/2 the threads were covered with aluminum :(
The service manager called around the US to get opinions from some of
the experts on what is the "correct" way to fix this.

This is what he got back as replies.  Keep in mind, this is second hand
since I did not talk to these people directly.

Kelly Moss Motorsport - my shop buys a bunch of suspension stuff from =
them
for their 944 customers, so they asked their opinion.  They say this has
happened before and Timeserts should be installed.  The bad part is that
the block has to be removed to do it because of the odd angle.

Andial had nothing to say.

PCNA says that a new or refurbished block is the only way to go.

PMNA says that a new or refurbished block is the only way to go.

So, since the car is still under warranty, I am letting the shop decide
which way is the best course of action.  Just for curiosity, I asked how
much each method would cost.  The refurbished block from Porsche is
apparently C$7000, the new block is C$14,000 and Timeserts are a few
hundred dollars + labour to remove the motor.

This seems to be a pretty rare occurence, anyone else have this happen
before?  Ask your engine builders for me, I'm curious.

About the head gasket failure.  Since I've had the failure of the head
gasket, I've had MANY emails about similar experiences, even with stock
boost and stock chips.  Perhaps it's age related?

I've asked the shop for some sort of courtesy car, since I will have
dropped over C$20,000 there when all is said and done in the last two
months alone!

Farzaan.
