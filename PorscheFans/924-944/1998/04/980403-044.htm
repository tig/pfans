I have a 1991 944S2 and I had the exact same problem with the air bag =
alarm indicator being set.

At lunch I went out and looked at the connector I my car. I found the 19 =
pin connector with the screw cap. That connector is were the DME engine =
computer diagnostic unit plugs into.=20

The 3 pin connector that you want to connect to, is off of the wire =
harness that comes out of the orange air bag controller. To find the 3 =
pin connector crawl into the passenger side foot well so that your head =
is directly under the glove compartment. When you look up you should see =
the glove compartment box. In front of (towards the engine) the glove =
compartment box is the orange airbag controller. Out of the front right =
(passenger side) corner of the orange airbag controller is a wire =
harness that is about a half inch in diameter. The wire harness is =
wrapped in black tape. Follow the wire harness with your hand for about =
two inches and you should find the white 3 pin connector coming off of =
the wire harness. The connector may be tucked in on the back side of the =
wire harness. You will probably have to feel around up there with your =
hands. If you rip the skin off your knuckles in the process then you =
should be on the right track.=20

You should probably read the codes that are in the system before you =
clear the alarm indicator. It would be useful to know what the codes are =
so that if they reappear, it might indicate a real problem. The mechanic =
that I talked to when I did mine said that exact timing when switching =
the signal on and off was very critical. (Germans are like that.) When I =
did it I was +/- each pulse length by about .3 seconds using my son's =
digital stop watch and it worked the first time. So if it does not work =
the first time then try again. You know practice makes perfect. At least =
that is what I tell my wife.

Let me know if you are successful.

Thanks,
Dieter

I think you are looking at the wrong connector if it has 19 female pins
on it. There is in fact a white 3 pin female connector in the wire
harness running along the fire wall just forward of the orange air bag
controller. The number two pin is the middle pin. The 3 pin connector is
not plugged into anything, it is just hanging off of the wire harness.

Dieter: thank you for the info. I will try your procedure this weekend.
I am a little confused about the location of this white connector.
According to the factory manual it is on the pass. side foot well. The
only thing I found here was this 19-pin connector covered by a screw-cap
about 4.5" diameter from which a rubber tassel hangs.

Is the white 3-pin connector anywhere near this large, round connector,
or is it behind the carpets? Do I need to remove the black, wooden DME
cover? Where would you say its location is relative to the DME? I
couldn't see the orange airbag controller either, where is that located?

Thanks for your help, sorry about the stupid newbie questions!
