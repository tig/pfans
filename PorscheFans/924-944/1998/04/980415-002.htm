       First, I want to thank everyone who consoled me about my timing belt
failure, misery loves company. My baby should be back on the road this
weekend with completely rebuilt head, guides, valves, the works. Special
thanks to Roxy and Larry.
     Now on to my new problem.  I recently acquired an 87' 944 NA, loaded,
low mileage but needs some engine work supposedly. The deal came with a good
bottom end engine because the new car again supposedly had a slight knock.
The car ran prior to sitting at the shop but parts were used to diagnose
other cars. The car gets no spark now at all. I originally thought the
computer was out but I checked it with another 87 NA and it fired right up.
I checked the DME relay, thank goodness I read every posting every night on
all out water pumpers. Its fine. I even borrowed a new one just in case but
again, no spark. The fly wheel sensors were checked, they were out of the
car in the engine compartment. They tested fine, connectivity through each
at the same rate and replaced. I replaced the distributor cap and rotor and
replaced the battery, still no luck. So where do I go from here guys?
Anything easy I'm missing here?  I've embarked on a new journey with this
car...one I've read a considerable amount about here on the list . I'll try
not to be a PITA I just want to start the car and work from there.
