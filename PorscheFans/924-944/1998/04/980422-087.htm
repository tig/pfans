Since my 1989 has been built up with many parts sold to me by members of this
list, I have named it the Listmobile.  Thanks to Alan in Kansas, who sold me
the car, Gary in Wisconsin, who sold me the Turbo S wheels, and Steve in
Houston, who sold me the Turbo S suspension pieces.

I ran the car at Portland Intl Raceway today, my first time at that track.
Great venue--it's an Indycar track.  I attended a Proformance Racing School
lapping day, which was attended by only a dozen cars.  A full day, with
instructors, for $200.  Hard to beat.

Near the end of the morning, the car began to feel really loose.  I then
caught the smell of antifreeze, so I immediately pulled off line and into the
pits.  The steel fitting that attaches to the line that provides coolant to
the throttle body had popped out, spraying coolant all over the rear tires.
The car was really horking up green stuff by the time I parked it.  Kinda like
The Excorcist.

An instructor gave me a lift to a nearby autoparts store, and I bought some
quickset epoxy.  The fix took just a  minute, and the heat of the engine set
the epoxy quickly so that I didn't miss any track time.  I was back in action
by the end of lunch.

As a former 911 pilot, I was interested in the difference between the cars.
The S2 is much more composed (better aerodynamics that a non-spoilered 911),
and the handling is more intuitive (i.e., lifting when the tail gets loose is
not an automatic ticket into the weeds).  The brakes are also more fade
resistant, and don't seem to vanish all at once like my 1988 Carerra's did.
On the negative side, it ate two full quarts of oil over the day (consumption
is normal in street driving), and had the aforementioned coolant problem.  The
911 was virtually bulletproof in two years of hard track use. 

As an aside, we had a few neat non-Porsches there, including a Viper GTS
coupe, a Ferrari 355, a BMW M3 set up for racing, and a BMW 735--with an
automatic-- that really got around the track!  I got a kick out of the fact
that the Viper had to let me by after I hung on his tail through the twisties
for a few laps.  He had 300 more cubic inches that I did!  Not that I claim to
be a  hotshoe, but it was nevertheless a lot of fun. 

What the car now desperately needs is a limited slip.  It really loses tractio
coming out of slow corners unless you really feather in the throttle. 

For only half the investment I had in my 911, the S2 is hard to beat.
