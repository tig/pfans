To the gentleman asking for muffler advice, I had a Borla on my 88-951, I
liked the sound, but then the turbo really muffles the sound, on an NA car
it will be louder. I didn't notice much diff in power, I wouldn't pick one
based on that. One thing I really didn't like is the look. It has a shiny
stainless steel finish and a round instead of oval tip. A freind said he
could spot me on the expessway from a mile away cause the exhaust was like
a beacon, shining in the sun. If borla made one shaped like an OEM I would
buy another, they will last forever, but I hate the look.
Also, I've heard Bursch is crap. I would stick with OEM.
