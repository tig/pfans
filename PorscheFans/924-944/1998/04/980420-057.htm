How did you get all those hose clamps off with the manifold in place?  And
the little bolts that hold on the valve?  The R&R on the manifold only
takes about 30 minutes anyway (I have done it about five times now for
various jobs).  If you are replacing the valve, it's a great time to also
replace those rubber hoses under the manifold.  The dealership will not (at
least in my case) sell the rubber hoses individually, but you can replace
them with fuel injection hose.  The dealership will sell you the
valve/wastegate hose though.

I did this in about 1991 and I frankly remember only that it was not easy
to get all the clamps back on, but I did it without removing the manifold.
I agree that if you have to remove the manifold, all the vacuum hoses
should be replaced, and if the car has a lot of miles and old hoses, it may
be better to do it that way. But, that should be an option offered to the
customer instead of quoting him 4 hours of labor to replace the cycling
valve. (JMO).
