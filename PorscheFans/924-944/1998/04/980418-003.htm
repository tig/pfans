Hi Pfans,
   I have been watching Farzaan`s delema unfold for the last couple of
day`s and can`t help thinking there has got to be a way to save this
block.  It`s only a stripped thread!  How about MIG welding the cutting
portion of the insert tap to a suitable length of steel dowel that would
allow you to reach down to the recessed thread portion of the hole.  It
seems to me that this is a situation that requires a little ingenuity in
order to save thousands of dollars and the engine rebuilder isn`t coming
to the show.  Are these the same guy`s that provided the disapointing
bodywork the first time through?  Anyway, this whole mess reminded me of
an incident that happened to a friend when he was doing a head gasket on
another vehicle. When you are installing head bolts or studs into a
blind hole, alway`s make sure the hole is free of antifreeze or oil. If
you don`t the stud will hydraulic and easily crack the block or tear the
threads out.            Good Luck       Dave C.
