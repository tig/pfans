I really doubt this is true. Ford owns Jaguar, and is very happy with
the progress. More likely would be Jaguar (Ford) buying Porsche.

Porsche wants to make more money. It doesn't take a lot of genuis
to see that SUV's are hot, while the sportscar market is kind of
flat. If Porsche wants to sell more cars (or a LOT more cars)
they have to expand into new markets. 

Do I want to see that happen? Not one little bit.
