Hi Konstantin,
	When you had the smog test done, did they measure the CO% under the hood at
the CO test plug? Most tests simply measure the CO% at the tail pipe. You need
to measure the CO% before the cat! There is a CO sample pipe that runs up to
the back of the cylinder head, back by the headers -it has a blue tap plug.

	A friend of mine at the Porsche dealer here in Washington DC says just to use
a multi-meter (measuring Volts) to set the CO using the cars onboard O2 sensor
readings! Here how: with the engine fully warmed up, pull apart the O2 sensor
(round connector, three wires) connector by the oil filler neck, measure the
voltage at the O2 sensor here (one pin - the sensor pin - will have 0.1-1.0
volts , the other two will have 12 volts (steady) for the heating element) you
want to adjust the mixture screw on the air flow meter box so that the VOLTAGE
readings is set to 0.60 VOLTS - that would be a perfect fuel air ratio - set
to the middle of the DME's specs. 
	Turning the CO set screw at teh airflow meter: turned clockwise = richer
mixture, turning counter-clockwise = leaner mixture

	The factory's CO% specs are: 0.6 plus or minus 0.2%, measure before the cat -
at the CO sample pipe. These specs are for the TURBO MODEL.

	After you set the CO% you might need to adjust the idle. On the drivers
fender there is a round cover with some pins, by the master cylinder area. Use
a jumper wire and connect a wire to pins "B" and "C" this take the idle
stablizer out of the loop, now adjust the idle screw at the throttle body to
set the idle speed(840 rpms plus or minus 20 rpms), then remove the jumper
wires. You are done! 
	Road test and see how it feels! 

	A NOTE: I have not personally tested this method, but I do trust my friends
knowledge and I am sure it works just fine! Good Luck

David
