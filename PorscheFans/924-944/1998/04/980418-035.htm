Sounds like a radiator that needs replacement...

Good Luck!

> Hello Porsche Fans,

> mid 80's

> itself. With the A/C on, no way. Even at highway speeds, it overheats.
> AAAHHHHH!!
>   History lesson:
>     A year ago, the coolant and thermostat was changed (got the
> thermostat

> thing. Mix was 50/50. No A/C last summer. Could not afford the
> compressor.
> Engine temp. fairly normal. But, the stuff I drained out that the

> phosphate-free stuff we are supposed to use. Right?? When I
> bought the car,
> it maintained correct temp. normally. (I should have left it alone.)
>    Today, I changed the coolant again. Same type of stuff went back in at
> 50/50 mix. I even added a 10" fan in front of the condinser to give a
> push-pull effect on the air flow. No help.
>    I am at my wit's end. The water pump seems to be doing it's job. The
> system moves coolant. When it overheats too much, it boils over
> until it is
> flowing out of the overflow tank drain.
>    Am I using the wrong mix of coolant? Does oil viscosity have any huge
> bearing on the engine temp? Right now I have regular 10W-40 in

>    I need "THE COLLECTIVE'S" help fast. I do not want to roast or
