That claim could be the result of lack of willingness to search for a part
from your parts guy.  It is not easy for a dealer to supply non-OEM parts 
and then have PCNA stand behind the parts w/ a 2 year warranty if it
breaks.  I also admit that it takes work to track down places
that carry parts that were not OEM on U.S. cars, but the places do exist.

Two quick examples, in efforts to minimize consumed bandwidth:
1)iPD carries the Euro side-mounted turn indicators for Volvo 850 models.
These were OEM on Euro models but never graced the sides of US models.
2)Timmons VW(a dealer), Autotech, New Dimensions, etc, will sell you the
combination switch that operates the parking lights, headlights and fog
lights for the A3 VW Jetta, again not an OEM part for US models.

Even if the parts cannot be found at the local dealership, often (but
not always) they can be found at aftermarket part suppliers.  Check out
Excellence, Panorama and every publication you can get your hands on, ads
appear in the funniest places at times.
