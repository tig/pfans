I've been losing about a cup of coolant every two weeks or so 
from my '84 944.  I hooked up a pressure tester and let it sit
for about 2 hours and saw some coolant occasionally dribbling 
either 'out from' or 'over' the water pump gasket, almost behind 
and slightly above the water pump outlet.  I can't tell exactly
where it's coming from.  The top coolant hose is not leaking.

My most likely suspect is the water pump gasket, but is it possible
to have *external* coolant leakage due to a leaking head gasket?  
Obviously I don't want to tear the thing apart only to discover
that I had the wrong culprit.

The water pump was replaced about 2 1/2 years and 10k miles ago with 
a re-built unit.  The car runs well otherwise.
