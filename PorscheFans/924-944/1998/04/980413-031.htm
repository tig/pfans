The only point I'm making (my comment being the dictionary part) is that
when people think of Porsche, they think sports car, watercooled or not.

Great, if this did go through and Porsche marketing could convince the
general public to buy Porsche instead of Ford when they wanted an SUV.
Given the reputation of maintenance costs for Porsche, I think people would
shy away from a Porsche SUV for that reason alone.
