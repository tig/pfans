Just wondering if anyone of the Canadian members of the list (it seems 
that there are a few) notice a discrepency when comparing prices in 
Canada to those in the US.

I was just thumbing through and Automotion catalog and was just 
comparing some of the prices in it to what was charged by my local 
Porsche dealer.  For the most part, the Porsche dealer was pretty much 
in-line with the prices in the catalog (ie. Canadian prices was about 
1.4 times the US price).  However, for one part, the 944 sunroof seal 
(944.564.114.05) there was a significant difference.  The Porsche 
dealer quoted me C$185 and in the Automotion catalog for US$70.  The 
difference is about C$85???

Any thoughts on why there would be such a difference??  I would expect 
the dealer to be a little more expensive.  However, you would think 
that it would be equally expensive across the board.  However, some of 
the parts are actually cheaper from my dealer than in the catalog.

Any information is much appreciated.  Thanks

Alex
