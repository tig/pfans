Greetings to all,

I have used a couple of air flow sensor conversions on two of my
previous turbo vehicles, a '92 Mitsu 3000GT and a '91 Talon AWD(auto-x
terror). I installed a HK$ VPC(speed/density) system on the 3000GT that
eliminated the stock flow sensor entirely. The Talon was initially
fitted with the HK$ VPC and later replaced with the EFI Systems
Programmable Management System utilizing a MAF sensor that appears to be
identical to the Autothority MAF unit. My experience has been this;
ANYTHING you can do to decrease pressure-drop in the intake and exhaust
system of a T-car will reward you with better overall performance. 
To date, only thing that has disappointed me with my new toy is the
turbo lag. The Talon's throttle response was instantaneous. I know that
much of this is due to the physical layout of the 944T's exhaust system,
that is, the relatively long distance from the head to the turbine.
Additionally, the signals to the cycling valve are not what I would
desire, given a choice( that's another subject, I see an aftermarket
controller in my future). But I suspect that the stock, "barn door" type
flow sensor is also largely at fault. When I purchased the 951, I
removed and cleaned the stock flow sensor. I was amazed at the amount of
effort it takes to open the door! The crudity of the unit seems entirely
inconsistent with the rest of the vehicle. There is certainly a
significant amount of energy expended simply sucking the door open. The
fact that the highest pressure drop(door closed) is encountered at low
RPM completes this "worst possible" scenario.
Since I have not tried the MAF conversion on my 951, my feeble
contribution is theoretical, at best. But, based on previous experience
with other T-cars, it simply has to be beneficial. I will be installing
the system as funds allow.
That brings us to this system's one serious flaw, the price! The EFI
Systems PMS for my Talon included the MAF sensor, a MAP sensor, a boost
solenoid, a piggy-back computer with serial port interface for
data-logging, software and a key pad for programming fuel/ignition and
boost curves. All this for $500 less than the Autothority MAF kit. Come
on guys, give us a break. Maybe a few of us can get together and
convince EFI to build a system for the 951.

Regards,
Steve Van Ingen
