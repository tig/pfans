The problem you are describing is in the heat sheild over the headers.
It kind of sounded like marbles in a coffee can.
My 86 951 did the exact thing between 2000-2500 rpms.
To find the shield jack the pass side up, reach up near the headers and
push on the shield (there are many) if one rattles you can either try to
re bolt it or place a piece of metal between the headers and shield. I
ended up using a 1" piece of lead as I could not even think of drilling
!! Don't laugh it has been 2 years and no rattle.
Also check the starter heat shield mine had a crack in it that also
rattled.

Hansman
86 951
no more rattles!
