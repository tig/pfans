No noise was introduced when the belts were replaced.  The whine was
introduced when the belts were retensioned at 731 miles after the
replacement.  I did not have the heart to see what 4000rpm sounded like,
it was bad enough at 3000rpm and then I took the car back to the shop.

It REALLY bugs me that the shop I took my car to uses the auto-tensioner
and not the 9201 tool to retension the timing belt.  I do not want to
re-ignite the belt thread, so I will just state I thought most felt the
auto-tensioner puts the tension in the ballpark, the use of the tool is
preferred (for those that do use the tool) and prescribed by the factory.
I will be seriously upset with the shop if any of my new H20 pump and
rollers die(s) in a year (or even worse in two after the warranty runs
out) because they have overtensioned the timing belt.  I am guessing they
overtightened it so the tension will be appropriate at least 30,000 miles. 
Myself, I would rather retension the belts at 15k miles and replace at 30k
and then skip the whine completely.

IMHO, you should tell them to use the tool for everything except the
V-belt for the servo pump (per the 944S/S2/T/TS Technical Spec manual).
Maybe someone can check the 968 Technical Spec manual to see if the
recommendation changed.  Given they are the dealer, I do not see why you
should pay them to guess at the tension.  Again, IMHO.

Comments, flames?
