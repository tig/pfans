Thanks to everyone who has given me tips, clues, etc.  on what may be
causing my headlights to hang sometimes.  I'll be checking into everything
this weekend and I'm sure one of the possible solutions will be my answer.

Have a nice afternoon,

That brings up another question.  Being that this car is 12 years old, it   
would really be nice if someone sold a 'set' of hoses that could be used   
to replace all the hoses at once for preventative maintenance.  Is there   
such a set somewhere?  And what about water hoses?

Dan,

Check booster function by placing your foot on the pedal while starting   
the
car.   The pedal will softly settle as vacuum builds up during the first
couple
of seconds after starting.   To check vacuum you need a vacuum gauge,
plugged into the system as close to the booster as you can make it   
happen.
You will be looking for about 20 inches of vacuum, and a typical booster
failure will knock you down to maybe 10 inches.    Consider that your
car is 12 years old and that every vacuum line in the engine compartment
is at risk from heat-hardening.    I believe there is also a check valve
at the booster, and a vacuum reservoir.

Good luck.

Dave
