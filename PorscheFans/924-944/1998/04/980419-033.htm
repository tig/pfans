Back from a day at Moroso a 2.25 mile track near West Pakm Beach Florida.
Actually not a driver's ed, more a hot lapping session. No instructors.
Three twenty minute sessions in the morning grouped according to type of car
and hp. Then an hour long open session, lunch brake and two hour and a half
open sessions in the afternoon. Limited to forty cars and with rules just
like the pca DEs for $140.00 including lunch. Many Porsches but lots of
other types as well. Went very smoothly with no incidents.

Unfortunately my brake problems continue. As the day wore on the brakes
became worse and worse until the steering wheel was bouncing in my hand at
which point discretion being the better part of valor, I retired for the
day. On the way home, once again the brakes seemed fine. The car seemed to
be pulling slightly to the left requiring a little right hand bias in the
way the steering wheel was being held on straight roads. When I got on the
highway I ran it up to 100 and got what felt like bad wheel shimmy in the
front. The braking was still fine. Tried it once again and no shimmy but
severe pulsation in the brakes. I'm really stumped. If I have to do over the
brakes fine, but if it is something to do with the suspension, I don't want
to do the brakes for nothing. I also noticed that I get about four times as
much brake dust on the fronts as on the rears. Any ideas?

I think that I definitely should try new pads. Help!!! TIA
