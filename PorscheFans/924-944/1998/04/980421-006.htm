Gary,
     First of all, the reason a tap is tapered on the end is not to provide
an interference
fit in a blind hole. The reason it is tapered is to provide a mechanism for
the tap to
cut into a new hole.
     Secondly, the ONLY way that friction could not play a part in the
tension on a
threaded fastener would be if the threaded surface was at a perfect 90
degree angle
to the applied tension. This is basic mechanical theory and also physically
impossible with a threaded fastener.

You state that,

"This makes complete sense, because once the item is torqued, there
is no movement between the bolt and the threads."

Why is there no movement?  FRICTION


You also state,

"As for Porsche saying to use oil during assembly, dasically they are
saying the
friction between the nut and the stud needs to be reduced for assembly.
Now
*if* reduced friction truly changes torque, then you have done just that by
using the oil on the nuts.  As the Bosch automotive handbook (3rd edition)
I am
holding here clearly shows a reduction in friction between steel & steel
(.12)
when lubricated (.08) (pg 49 by the way)."

That is exactly why Porsche specifies that only engine oil and no other
lubricant should be used on the threads. It does change the applied tension
at a specified torque. But, by specifying that ONLY engine oil is to be
used, the torque is changed by a known quantity.
