If you are only going to use the car on tracks that are smooth, I'd
recommend going for the Weltmeister adjustable front swaybar instead.
The problem with this bar is that you must drill a hole through the
steel control arm to mount it. I have broken 3 control arms in half
right through this hole so I'd recommend looking for stress cracks after
every session and replacing the control arms on a regular basis. But the
adjustability of the Weltmeister bar will probably be too large of a
benefit to lose on a purpose-built race car. I don't know if IT rules
allow it, but you might consider going to aluminum or Fabcar control
arms, or having the steel ones strengthened by welding Rebar or some
other metal rod to the front and rear edges. The control arms are THE
BIG weak points with these cars on the track - beware!

--I am looking to replace my stock steering wheel, anyone have a smaller
diameter racing wheel they want to sell?  Or recommend a nice one.  I
have
a stock 4 spoke and it seems like Id benefit from having a wheel that is
both smaller and about 2" further out from the dash.  (I have very
little
clearance between the bottom of the wheel and my legs, at 6' tall and
170
pounds)
>>>>>>>

I put a Momo Monte Carlo in my '84 with one spacer. The difference was
amazing. I highly recommend getting this wheel or one that is similar.
I've seen it on sale for $170 or so new.

--Tires: Max dia. & width rim for my car in this class is 15" x 7".  BFG
Comp TA R1s are available in 225-50R15 (606mm O.D.), however this would
be
smaller diameter than stock 215-60R15 (639mm O.D.).  I am thinking that
it
would be beneficial to run a wider tire for better cornering and a
smaller
tire for a shorter gearing effect, but am looking for advice from the
list.
 Another option is 205-60R15 (215-60R15 is not an available R1 size)  I
am
leaning heavily toward the 225-50R15s right now...
>>>>>>>

Run - don't walk - away from 60 profile balloon tires. The 50 profile
tires are much better and the smaller diameter really helps the 944's
gearing. I ran 225/50x15s for years. Do it! You could even run
245/50x15s on the rear but I think the car really responds to the
gearing the 225s give it and you'd have even more understeer.

--I will consider any strut braces or rigid upper strut mounts, hard
suspension bushings etc. anyone has for sale/ or recommend high quality
manufacturers, my need is not immediate but may be by late summer.

thanks,
