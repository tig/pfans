My experience with mufflers on my 83 NA has been more intense than I would
have liked.

Two years ago I hit a pipe lying on the highway which knocked my OE muffler.
It ended up "blowing" an inside baffle and making an awful noise. At the time,
I was tight on cash, so I looked around and picked up an ANSA replacement for
$179 from Vertex, in Miami.

It turns out, this only bought me some time. After little over a year, it
ended up sounding badly again. This time, a stress fracture had formed right
at the intake of the muffler. My Porsche mechanic recommended a local muffler
shop, where the technician recommended a replacement from BOSSAL. They are
made in Belgium, and almost identical to OEM. Aluminized steel.

The one on mine sounds exactly like the OE did, but cost $300 less. The BOSSAL
cost me $430 installed, but I just got really tired of my car sounding like a
souped up CRX. This is the real thing, believe me.

P.S. You can mail in a $20 form and receive a lifetime warranty with a BOSSAL
purchase. If you want to look them up, I know they're in New Jersey.

Good luck. Keep 'em stock. Porsche knew what they were doing...
