J.P.,
I don't claim to be the be all end all source of knowledge, but here goes:
<< 1.- What wheels can be fitted to the 951 that came from other p-car models
 and years? specialy the 17" ones.  will late model 993 fit?<<<

 Yes.  The '86 951 (mine) has a 23mm offset, just like 911's up to '89.  After
'86 for 951's and after '89 for 911's the offset went to 52mm to clear room
for ABS.  NOt sure about S2 and 968.

>>> 2.- my car has a base suspension.  what is the most logical path for
 upgrade? i've heard of upgrading the shocks and fitting a stiffer front sway
 bar but how about the rear? do strut bars do a significant difference on
 this car?<<<

I think the most common route is shocks, then front springs, then swaybars,
then torsion bars.  The torsion bars should be done w/ the springs, but cost
alot because of labor.  I have upgraded everything but the torsion bars at
this point.  Alot of people put larger springs on front and a larger swaybar
in back to balance it (see high cost of torsion bars).  I think the best bet
though, is to do shocks all at one time, springs/torsion bars all at one time,
and swaybars all at one time.
 
 >>>3.- have also heard that transaxel will not take more than about 350 hp.
 where's the weak link?  >>

I've heard this one to, and I've heard people on this list more knowledgable
than I say "don't believe everything you hear" with regards to the max HP the
tranny can take.  If you get the motor over 350hp, and the tranny breaks, fix
it.  That's all I can say.   The weak link may be the 1st and 2nd gears which
are cast on the earlier 951's and hardened on the '88 951S and '89 951 (and
later in other countries).  If i get over 300 hp, my main transmission problem
is going to be lack of LSD.

Hope this helps.
