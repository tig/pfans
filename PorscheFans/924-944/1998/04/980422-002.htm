Philip,
If it's any good I would say buy it, my Porsche garage owner says, and a lot 
of people of this list
would agree with him, that the 951 is the best value Porsche you can buy. I 
can't believe that a 4 year older
911 will be any cheaper to run and may even cost more. The 951 as Tom Pultz 
said handles and performs better and
has better equipment i.e. ABS, A/C, etc. than an equivalent age 911. The 911 
will also cost considerably more.

Like any car and particularly a high performance car, regular maintenance is 
essential and will cost. I have had a 1987 951 for
almost 3 years and it has cost me 3400 GBP in maintenance bills, which are 
listed below:

23/08/95  GBP       9.60      2 Headlight bulbs
08/01/96  GBP       47.47     Headlamp and wiper blade
05/02/96  GBP       44.99     New Battery
11/03/96  GBP       47.00     Interior trim
19/03/96  GBP  430.00    84000 Service + parts
10/04/96  GBP  474.00    New Heater Control Unit
02/08/96  GBP  108.00    Air conditioning refill
12/08/96  GBP  106.00    Front brake pads replaced
10/01/97  GBP  10.99     Front wiper blades
21/02/97  GBP  175.06    90000 Service + parts
29/04/97  GBP  60.00     Wheel Alignment
30/04/97  GBP  37.02     Brake Fluid
22/05/97  GBP  190.42    Front wheel bearing + aircon refill
24/05/97  GBP  420.00    Front and rear tyres
28/05/97  GBP  82.25     Wheel ALignment
01/08/97  GBP  305.00    A/C repair
01/02/98  GBP  812.00    96000 service + belts + rear brake pads +
               wheel bearing + misc

Total     GBP  3,359.80  

I think despite the cost these cars are reliable and you have to remember 
that even a 1989 car is 9 years old and parts are going
to wear out from old age. I still think they are worth it and you will 
probably find the extra maintenance costs over an 'ordinary' car are
compensated by the low or nil deprecation.

I would say that GBP14K is a little bit espensive for a 89 951, that is the 
sort of price I would expect to
pay at  a dealer's but having said that if the mileage is genuine and it has 
a faultless service history then maybe it is worth
paying  a little over the odds.

For maintenance at an affordable cost I  would recommend Ray Northway (01189 
714333) and he is based near Reading.

I hope this helps in your decision, any other queries let me know.

Many thanks.
