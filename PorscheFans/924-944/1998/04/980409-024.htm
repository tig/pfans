I agree that we should expect a Porsche dealer to use the Porsche
tensioning tool. But this brings up an interesting point: is the whine
actually caused by overtensioning the belt? My dealer tells me that the
whine is actually a good sign, as it's evidence of a wider timing belt
that was introduced by Porsche in the early 90's. My response was: how
come the '94-'95 968's don't exhibit this whine? (I forget what the
dealer's answer was).

Hate to beat a dead horse here, but what's the consensus? Is the whine a
good thing, or a bad thing? Is it too much tension (bad), or is it the
wider belt (good)?
