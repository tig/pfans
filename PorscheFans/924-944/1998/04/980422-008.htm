     Michael,
     
     I replaced the seal on my car two years ago without incident.  I 
     discovered a little 'trick' for the reinstall.  
     
     First, be sure that you are installing the seal in the proper 
     orientation.  The section of the seal looks like a U on its side.  A 
     spring is visible on the inside of the U.  The open side of the U 
     faces the engine and the flat side faces forward.  It can be a little 
     tricky to install the seal because it must slip over a sleeve on the 
     ID.  After lubing the seal hold it up against the lip of the sleeve. 
     Then use a small wooden stick (from a Q-tip or toothpick) to work the 
     inner lip of the seal over the sleeve.  Basically you rub the stick 
     around the ID to move the lip over.  Finally, seat the seal with a 
     suitable socket so it is orthogonal to the shaft and recessed 
     properly.  
     
     Of course, before installing the new seal be sure the sealing surfaces 
     are clean and smooth.
