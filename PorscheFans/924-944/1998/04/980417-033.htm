Jan --

OK, we've visited this before, but here's some feedback. I've driven a late
'85 w/out the balance shaft belt and agree that the vibration isn't bad. 
I've read (Cotton's book) that Porsche claimed their 2.5 liter engine was
smoother w/out the shafts than a comparable Mitsubishi engine w/ shafts,
but I haven't seen statements by Porsche that it's OK to remove the shafts.
 Other P-Fans have had a different experience; lots of vibration without
the belt.  I'd be curious to know if this is due to differences in
perception or differences in engines. 

The shafts sap about 4 hp.  There are seal kits for completely removing the
shafts. I had one recommended by a Porsche engine builder.  You might want
to check out this option if you're sold on the idea.  But I don't
understand why you think your car "runs lighter" and "sounds better" just
because you removed the belt.  Take the shafts out if you want it to
actually run lighter.  W/ regards to making the engine more complex, the
balance shafts are pretty straightforward rotating masses that don't cause
any problems until a seal leaks or the belt slips.

Wonder what the 3 liter engine feels like w/out the shafts.
