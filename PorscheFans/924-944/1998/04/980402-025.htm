I have the same intermittent gas odor in my 968 coupe (65k miles).  It
used to
be much more prevalent, but now I notice it only occasionally.  I spent
about
$300 having 2 mechanics look for it in the past, with all the usual
culprits
checked, and none found anything.  I replaced the charcoal cannister,
pressure
tested the tank, examined all connections, etc.  I gave up, and it is
becoming
less frequent.  My 92 cab with 8k miles has the smell occasionally as
well.

I suspect a design flaw here.  I'm not going to waste any more time or
money
on it unless someone actually finds a source.

You don't say how or what you tested when you said you "tested the
tank."  But I'll assume the tank wasn't your problem.  My experience may
apply to others though.

Here's what I encountered on my 951 and several mechanics have
encountered similar incidents on 944's with the plastic tank (post
85.5?).  The nipple for the fuel filler neck assembly is mounted at the
top of the tank, but it's metal and not plastic.  Porsche used some type
of special adhesive/welding process to secure the metal fitting within
the molded plastic tank.  Apparently, this seal may fail over time in
the form of a small hairline crack.  You CANNOT see this crack by simply
inspecting the filler neck/hose assembly, and the leak is a very SLOW
ooze, but produces a pungent smell nonetheless.  Every time I replaced a
hose/clamp/part down in that awful corner, it looked like gasoline was
slowly oozing out from undeneath that chunky "sock" hose that fits over
the metal nipple.  I thought it was a seating/sealing problem with the
hose, but further investigation revealed the hairline crack.  Here's how
you can confirm if your problem is indeed the same as mine:

- It helps if you can remove as much of the filler neck assembly as
possible, but is not necessay.  At least remove the cover under the
carpet so you can see what's going on

- fill the gas tank up all the way up to the top;  if you have a leak,
the side of the tank and area around the filler neck should be stained
by now and look wet

- use a high pressure air hose to blow off (evaporate) the excess
gasoline around the area.  Once it has dried, remove the air hose and
immediately observe where the moisture returns/originates (use a
striplight or flashlight to help view).  I had to do this step about 10
times to positivelly identify the inch-long crack at this seam because
the whole area will stain very quickly once the air is removed.  The
first 5 times, I still thought the gas was coming from under the "sock"
hose and then rolling over the lip of the plastic-metal weld/seam.  Then
I realized that the gas was coming from the seam itself and staining the
area both above and below it.

Oh yeah, if this is your problem, you have 2 choices.  Replace with
new/used tank ($$$$$), or use this crazy $60/tube silicone sealant
(sorry I don't remember the name of it, but it is STRONG stuff that
laughs at solvents like gasoline; the color of the goup is white, BTW)
on the whole seam once you've cleaned off the surfaces.  Both choices
involve extensive labor.

I hope this helps someone who has already eliminated the possiblility of
vent hoses and all the other junk that's in there.  Gas smells SUCK!
For those who don't have the time to address their problem right now, I
do remember that you can alleviate the fumes a little by keeping the
windows and sunroof closed.  But open them up, and you'll be one HAPPY
driver in a matter of minutes, if you know what I mean...   :)
