All,
No one corrected my earlier mistake so I will correct it myself. I 
should have RTM (reread the manual) before I opened my mouth. But I 
think there is still a point to make that hasn't been made before. 
The Hayne's manual does NOT say that in all cases the car should be 
towed to a dealer for tensioning after belts are installed. What it 
says is that if the installation procedures are followed precisely 
then the car CAN be driven to the dealer for final tensioning. If the 
procedure is not followed then it is recommended to tow the vehicle. 


It should be noted that the Hayne's manual does not give the 
procedure for setting timing, only for removing and reinstalling the 
SAME belt.  

The point I want to make is that for folks who want to replace their 
own belts and want the belts tensioned with the gauge but don't want 
to buy the gauge it is possible to do your own work and then drive 
the car to the dealer for tensioning (assuming the correct procedure 
for setting timing is followed). YMMV.
