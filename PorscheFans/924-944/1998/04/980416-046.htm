Hello Porsche Fans,
  I just had a great experience with one of our fellow members. He was going 
on vacation to Florida, and was able to bring an A/C compressor he was 
selling with him. I bought it from him, and now live in luxury once again 
with real A/C. Thanks Eben. 
  BUT!, I still have a problem with my A/C system that I was wondering if 
anyone knew anything about. The recurculation button does NOTHING except 
light up when I press it. It has never worked since I bought the car (87' 
944 NA). I do not want to start tearing the dash apart until I know where to 
start. Anyone seen this before, or know anything about how the recurculation 
system works? PORSCHE says, "Uhh, I don't know. Bring the car in, and we'll 
look at it." Right, at $75.00/hr. NOT! 
  Any help would be apresheated. 
     Todd
