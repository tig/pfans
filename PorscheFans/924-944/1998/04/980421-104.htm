    Okay, I mentioned this once before on the list and I'll mention it
again.  I'm looking for everyone on the list to send me a picture of
their porsche so I can put them all up on a picture page.  If you've got
more than one car I'll take a picture of each but only one picture per
car please.  Now I know that not everybody has access to a scanner but I
do.  So if you want you car up on the page but you can't get a picture
scanned in, drop me a line and I'll send you my mailing address.  You
can send the photo to me that way.  The only other thing I'd like with
the picture is a little info such as the year, model, colour code,
milage and anything else you think is important enough to put up.  The
other thing I wanted to mention was I did get some responses on the idea
of a parts page so buyers and sellers can get together.  If anyone has
an opinion on me setting one up drop me a line and let me know.  This is
just as a service I'm not any sort of retailer.
