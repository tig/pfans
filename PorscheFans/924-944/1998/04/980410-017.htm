Wow! There's a new one that I thought I'd never hear of in my life! All
the time Jaguar has always been competing against Porsche for
ages......either in production or on the track and now this? Wow! This
would be interesting. Does this mean that when Jaguar falls under
Stuttgart's reign, that Jaguar's powerplants would shift from the Ford
designed V8's to maybe Porsche's flat-six/boxer design? Hey, maybe
Jaguar could be the first to utilize the boxer engine in an engine
forward/ transaxle rear design? .......just rambling.

As far as SportUts go, I think of them as a fad, fashion statement, and
status element. Most of them guzzle excessive gasoline and many handle
poorly on the road. They also cost a lot. .......just my opinion. I'm
not trying to "bad mouth" SUV's. It's just that I don't see their
purpose and the validity to spend so much money on a hybrid of a luxury
vehicle w/ a wannabe HUMV.

	I really doubt this is true. Ford owns Jaguar, and is very happy
with
	the progress. More likely would be Jaguar (Ford) buying Porsche.

	Porsche wants to make more money. It doesn't take a lot of
genuis
	to see that SUV's are hot, while the sportscar market is kind of
	flat. If Porsche wants to sell more cars (or a LOT more cars)
	they have to expand into new markets. 

	Do I want to see that happen? Not one little bit.
