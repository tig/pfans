Hi Group,

I thought I would take another shot at getting some feed back on
chipping my S2.  Has any one done this ? And did you like the results?
I was considering one from Europroducts, Autothority or Super Chips?
Anyway I'm ready to take the plunge but, was hoping for some "been
there, done that" wisdom.  Also I have ordered a Blau  "Miami"  car
receiver my original Reno 2 has problems and I would like to keep the
care as stock as possible on the outside. :-)  Will the Miami wiring be
exactly the same or  will I need a harness?  Lastly what 4x6 speakers
seem to do the best with the stock radio?  I have a cab so I have plenty
of noise in the cab anyway but, the stock speakers sound real tinny.
Sorry about the bandwith.  I'm getting anxious in upstate N.Y.

Thanks,

Rick Casadonte
