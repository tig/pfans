This is funny - for the last 6 months i've hopelessly tried to track a
somewhat tinny-metallic ringing sound that only occurs when accelerating
through the 2200-2300 rpm range.  I'd thought it was a loose heatshield,
but I have been unable to track it down.  The wastegate rattle is
something I never thought of.  Although I cannot offer any help, I
thought I'd tell you youre not alone - and that i've had the same
problem for nearly half a year without any problems occuring other than
the annoyance of the rattle.  Mine seems to sound worse in the car than
from the outside, and really its not very loud at all.  But obviously,
if it is the wastegate it not "suppossed" to rattle, so something is
wrong - how harmful it is I cannot say, but nothings happened to me for
6 months.  Anyone have any ideas, hints, suggestions??
