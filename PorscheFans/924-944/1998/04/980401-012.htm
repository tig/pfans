Orig. posted to the 928 list by mistake; sorry-

Problem: 83 944, with a sudden no start problem.  It was running up to
the point where it was parked, then a few hours later, it wouldn't start or
give any indication that it was even close.  No spark, and no pulses at the
negative side of the ignition coil.

Seemed like it was the ECU not putting out the ignition pulses, but I
swapped it with a spare that worked before, and still no ignition output,
so I'd tend to rule out the ECU.

Does anyone have specs on the signal level put out by the speed sensor to
the ECU?  I've checked out the airflow sensor at the sensor terminal; the
reference sensor at the ECU harness, and the speed sensor at the harness.

Airflow sensor: 0.19V engine off
                0.40V maximum, cranking
Temp sensors, approx 3.2k ohms, at 60 degrees
Reference sensor, over 5V peak-peak, cranking
Speed sensor, 2.5V peak-peak, cranking.
Start signal, 12 during cranking

The output level for the speed sensor seems much lower than that of the
reference sensor; is it suppposed to be approximately the same level?

Seems like the signals are getting to the ECU, but it's not sending out the
ignition pulses to the coil-  are there any other inputs to the ECU that
could keep it from outputting the ignition pulses?

Doug from the list indicated the impedance of the reference sensor should
be in the range of 1k, so I'll see if mine is in that area-
