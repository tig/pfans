There are a number of transport companies specializing in exotic cars
that you might want to call.  Here are five to start with: Intercity
(800-343-0802), Passport Transport (800-325-4267), Horseless Carriage
(800-631-7796), Coast to Coast (800-221-3936), and Thomas Sunday
(800-541-6601).  Horseless supposedly has the national contract with
Ferrari NA, and both Intercity and Thomas Sunday advertise in Pano, but
I have no idea what their relative cost-competitiveness is.  Welcome
back to the Mainland.
