I thought I had heard about this, but I was not able to dig up any
pertinent information.

Apparently, my rear rotors are slightly warped as evidenced by brake
noises coming from the back when lightly applying the brakes.  When I took
my car in to have its belts retensioned, I asked the shop to check the
brakes and verify my theory.  They either took the brakes apart, or
removed the pads or something, checked and said my hypothesis is correct.   

Well, now I can hear my rear brakes rattle every time the rear wheels go
over a bump and I can also hear them rattle as they follow the rotors on
the highway.  :-(.  I know it is the brakes because light left foot
braking while driving gets rid of the noise. My car was not quiet to begin
w/, but now it is ridiculous.  How can I get rid of the noises?  Is that
what the strips of aluminum are about, or was that for squeal reduction? 
I took the car back to the shop, but I want to have a backup plan in case
they say they cannot restore the brake to their previous state of
quietness.

And talk about the belt noise!  Even when the belt was new I had no noise,
now my 951 sounds like the fan of a Citroen 2CV, it is so loud I cannot
hear the turbo whine any more. 

As always, TIA for any suggestions.
