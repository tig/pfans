It's just my personal taste, but I do not like the look of car bras at 
all.  I guess they would make your paint last longer by preventing some 
chips, but's it's kind of like those plastic covers people put on their 
furniture.  Sure it will last longer, but it will look tacky for a longer 
time!  It also seems as if the bras would make it more of a pain to wash 
the car (don't know for sure, since I've never owned one, but I would 
think you would want to remove it whenever you washed/waxed the car).  
But in the end, it's your car, and you should do with it whatever you 
like!
