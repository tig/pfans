Hi. A 944 Turbo I know well - like it's mine - is misbehaving. The
problem has been ongoing for two months and I'm quite desperate for
help. My service agent seems to have reached a dead end having found
that the engine's brains are OK.

The problem is that the Turbo does not come on. My local service agent
(Parr's of South Godstone, Surrey in the UK) has done various things and
spent a lot of time on it but haven't been able to get to the root of
the problem. They have ...

- Sent the DME and KLR (?) brains off to a re-conditioner and tester who
gave them the all clear. They pass all tests. The tests were checks of
current consumption, internal voltages, cranking input, relay drivers,
ignition outputs, injector outputs, idle valve output, airflowmeter
input, air temperature input, water temperature input, throttle maximum
input, supply voltage compensation, throttle minimum input, start
routine and rev limit.

- Replaced the two throttle valve switches since the original ones were
found to be faulty.

- Swapped engine computers from a working 944 Turbo and found no change
in my car's behaviour.

- connected up a Bosch diagnostic device and got no fault code readings
from the DME brain.

The conclusion seems to be that a) the brains are OK, b) the turbo
charger may be receiving all the right inputs but due to an internal
fault isn't working or c) the car controls and sensors are delivering
the wrong information to the brains.

The technician who has been working on my casr has just left Parrs so
I'm looking at the prospect of their second string technician working on
a problem that their main man couldn't solve.

What kind of things might not be found by an averagely (possible under-
average) experienced technician in trying to fix such a malfunctioning
944 Turbo?

The car is a 1988 220 bhp 944 Turbo coupe.

Thanks for any help members of this list can offer.

Chris
