    The bizarre thing is that the people that WILL sell the entire
package want
    MORE money than the people who sell the bits and pieces, I thought
you get
    a better deal when you buy everything from one person???

Is this supposed to be surprising? Which takes more effort - selling
some parts that you may not even have (you order them when you get an
order), mark them up a little bit and ship them out the door, or doing
the real R&D to put together viable packages?

Knowledge costs money. With many years doing product development work, I
can tell you that research is very expensive. With even more years in
the parts biz, I can also tell you that losing sales because someone
with no investment and little overhead can resell parts cheaper is very
frustrating.

You might want to think about this the next time you find a "real
bargain".
