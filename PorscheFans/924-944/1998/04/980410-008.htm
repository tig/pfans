John, and all you tekky Pfans,

Thanks for your responses... I had several, with widely varying 
opinions, but I think John's closest to right.   This is because I 
now find that if the LT connection to the distributor is 
disconnected, the engine cranks over smoothly with no baulking.  
However, I've now fitted new plugs, HT leads (5) distributor cap and 
rotor arm, and it's still the same :-(
Further, if I connect my timing light between #1 outlet on the 
dist.cap and #1 spark plug lead, and get the engine running (badly), 
it's definitely missing beats, like flash, flash,flash, flash, 
nothing, nothing, flash, nothing, flash, flash etc....
So I'm now left with coil, distributor LT (Hall effect switch), and 
transistor unit as remaining possible culprits. I tested the 
resistances of the Primary & secondary windings of the coil as per 
Mr. Haynes instructions, and all is in spec. Also the ballast 
resistor wires seem ok.
Any suggestions for further tests? I'm getting among the expensive 
bits now, and don't really want to go buy a new ECU just to find no 
change....

 I wrote......

>>2) after checking the timing belt, basic ignition timing, plugs

>>eventually spun enough to fire up, but engine runs like only 2 or 
>>3 cylinders firing, then stalls after a few seconds - won't idle.

John replied....
