Well Tom, I wasn't "dumped" from the list.  I recieved my confirmation(2
infact one "from letter"saying it was too bad I wanted to leave) that
said I had requested removal at XXX time on XXX day from XXX lists.  So
no, that wasn't like the digest just not showing up.  And after another
928 owner friend of mine sending a request for why to the list master,
we found it wasn't a random "dump" it was done by a list member.

As for as the "I do think it is a good idea to put 924, 944, 968, 951,
S2 or such in the subject if the post applies specifically to one of
those cars".  I would rather see it defined by problems and Ntech or
not, simply beacuse a lot of the info is common or relevent to all the
Porsche 4 cylinders.  I think if everybody is so worried about missing
something, they need turn off that TV for an hour of prime time shows
and read the list!  I think the same thing goes for the people without
"time" for the non tech stuff.  It's kinda like the guy that complains
he doesn't have the cash to fix a $500 repair on his car, but he can go
and buy a new $500 CD player radio for it.  it all comes down to what's
important to you ( anyone).  And for those who simply don't want to be
on the list or help with tech questions cause the list is too much
trouble to sort out or too hard to read, then that tells us what level
of effort they are willing to put forth to be a part of this community!
Sorry guys, but not everything is easy or exactly the way I want it, but
that doesn't mean I blow it off, I just adjust!  Beacuse it is something
I want to do!

Hey I for one am glad to see the transition to the "NTECH" and "leaving
the list" posts from the timming belt tool!!  LOL did that save me?

Hey, don't anybody unsubscribe me for this message!!!!
