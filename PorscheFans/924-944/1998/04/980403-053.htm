Don't take it to Gerhard's Autohaus or JMC automotive! =20

There was a posting some time ago that did include a recommendation but =
I have not tried them yet, I will try to locate the info.  I use the =
dealer for most work, especially the timing belt.  If the belt were =
somehow defective and the dealer installed it I feel better about the =
chances of the dealer warranting the whole mess.  There is a 944 Guru at =
Jim Ellis, his name is Jack Swent.  Great guy and access to him is =
pretty easy on the phone.

In fact, I just got my 951 back from them tonight, one of the many =
Atlanta crooks broke out one of the rear windows and relieved me of a =
car phone.

greetings,
my (new to me) 86 951 is due for a timing belt change. doing it myself =
and
then going to a shop for the proper tension setting is a possiblity, =
however,
letting a shop do the whole thing is more realistic.  any nominations =
for the
title of 'Atlanta 944 Guru??'

TIA,
brian young
86 951
