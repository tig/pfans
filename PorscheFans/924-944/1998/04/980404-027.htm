        I have been having a lot of problems with water-sometimes more than
a quart-in the right rear wheelwell.  Turns out water was pouring in
through the right taillight lens housing. I found this out by washing the
car one day and finding the well full of water. I directed water pressure
at the taillights and presto, it ran through on the right side.
        Fixing this is pretty easy.  NAPA sells black butyl window sealant
(looks like black licorice).  Remove the taillight inner bulb holder and
then the lens itself (6 screws, I think), and pop it off. To get at all the
screws, you might have to pop the carpet off of the right inner fender a
little bit, which in my case resulted in breaking one of the plastic little
rivet-things that hold the carpet to the metal.
        The old sealant--looks like the identical stuff that I bought-- was
still tacky, but very little was present on top of the lens while the
bottom was gorged on the stuff. I don't know if the job was poorly done the
last time around or if the butyl slowly sags to the bottom of the lens when
it is hot.
        I used a wooden chopstick to work off the old sealant, cleaned the
area, and ran a continuous bead of the butyl around the rear of the lens
housing.  It sticks quite nicely to the lens plastic and is easy to work
with.  Then I carefully lined up the lens housing with the car body and
pushed it into place and tightened the nuts and squashed the butyl into a
seal. I gave the car a full wash and rinse, aimed the garden hose right at
the lights to test it, and it did not leak at all.
