Subject: Tech: Cooling fans and power antenna ??

OK, this one has me confused.  My recently acquired 1984 944 had a broken
mast on the power antenna, so I decided to replace it.  I removed the old
Hirshman unit and cut the wires going into it (red,white,black).

When I put the new one, (not a Hirshman), back in I used a multimeter on
the wires.  Black showed ground, white 7volt at accessary ??, and red
12volt at acessary.  Nothing was 12volt constant, so I ran a wire back to
the battery for that.  I hooked up the red to the switched 12 in on the
antenna, and the black to the ground on the antenna.

My antenna now goes up when I turn the key on, but will sometimes go down
on its own.  When I turn the air conditioning on the antenna goes down and
the engine cooling fan does not come on.  If I turn the AC off the antenna
goes back up again.  Also, when the car gets hot the engine cooling fans do
not turn on.

I tried pulling the two wires from the temp switch on the radiator like my
Hanes says to do.  I ran a wire between the two terminals but still no fan.
 After I hooked the wires back up though the fan worked once, but it
doesn't anymore.

What have I done?? Anyone have any ideas or maybe a wiring diagram that may
help me?  This is driving me crazy!  I know it's something simple, but I'm
gonna take it to the shop soon if I can't figure out what it is.

The red wire comes from fuse 3 (16 amp) which also supplies the fans. The
white wire is the Auxiliary wire from the radio to switch the antenna up
and down and the black is the earth.

If you cut all three wires together they may have shorted with the cutters
and blown the fuse.
Good luck.
Martin
