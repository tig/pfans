My mechanic told me 10% of purchase price when I was looking for my car.
After owning it for a few years, I think that would pretty much cover it.
HOWEVER, since there are a few things that cost ALOT of money if they go wrong
I would probably recommend 20%.  luckily those type problems aren't that
common.  It sounds like it on this llist, but that's just because you've got
1500 people voicing thier problems.  It should help you to learn specific
items to look for.
