>  Does the 944 require an odd sized battery, or will a certain group/type
of aftermarket battery fit properly. If it is a specialized unit, will a VW
(cheaper) battery fit, and if so, what model? I don't actually have the car
yet, but I know its going to need a battery, and I want to get one that
fits properly and won't short out on the hood!

Yes, its called "Group 41" or similar. Readily available as a VW
replacement battery.

You can go with a small generic battery (I forget the group) provided you
extend the supplementary ground cable (I just use an extension) and
lengthen the slot in the battery hold-down piece by a 1/4" or so. Offset
the battery towards the passenger compartment, cover the +ve terminal, and
it'll work fine (and is much cheaper).

Just make *damn* sure the battery box isn't corroded, and fix *any* sign of
corrosion immediately.
