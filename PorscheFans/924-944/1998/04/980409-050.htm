As Porsche tries harder and harder to become an "everything to everyone" kind
of company, rather than an "everything to someone" kind of company (notice
I did not say they are becoming a "something to everyone" kind of company),
you will find that Porsche products will become more and more watered down.

Look at the new 996.  I personally like the car, but the materials looked
cheap when we saw the car in Germany.  The Boxster dash to me looks tacky.
I still think the most functional and nice looking dash is the 944/968 dashes.
There is only one switch I can't seem to find when I need it (wiper delay
dial), but all the others are within reach and I like the small dash aspect
of the car.  The new 996 to me is kind of like a Supra TT.  Yeah, it would
be a cool car to own, but is it a car I dream about every time I sit staring
at my computer at work?  No.  The 993 is a car I dreamed about, as is the
C2 Turbo S, but the 996 and even to some extents the 993TT don't do it for
me.  The 944 Turbo is a car I've loved the shape of since 1986 and my other
favourite Porsche would be a 550 Spyder with some honkin' turbo motor dropped
into it.

For me, I want Porsche to bring out the 968 Turbo S again.  I want that car
more than any other car I've seen before, moreso than a 911 Turbo or the
new TT.

If you look at the materials you got back in the olden days, it's of a much
higher quality.  The sport seats in my car look 10X more durable than a new
Boxsters or even a 993.  The opposite is probably true, but the new cars look
like plastic in a lot of areas.

Of course, the other argument is that my 944T when new sold for C$73,000
including tax, whereas a reasonable Boxster is C$60,000, so I guess the PO
did pay a lot more for these luxuries.

Oh well, enough bitching about the good ol' days :)
