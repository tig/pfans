What you saw was most likely a 968. They came out in 92 and were sold up
till 95. The Factory (Porsche) made about 12k of them only 4.3k came to US
of those 2.2k were cabs. Bruce Anderson called them the "best of the
924/944/968 series". The motor is a 3L that puts out 236hp and is coupled
with a 6 speed box. The transmission is a close ratio type which when
couples with the massive torque make the car ready to go whenever you want
it to.

I lost my 944 NA and replaced it with a 968 if it were not for the interior
looking like the 44, I would say it is a different car altogether.

	pfolks,
	Spent the day in the Crescent City yesterday (New Orleans) at the
Freeport-McDermott Golf Classic.  I went downtown afterwards and was driving
down Canal Street and saw another waterpumper. Can anyone tell me what model
has a 928-ish rear end. It had PORSCHE embossed across the rear end and 928
style taillights. This was one good-looking car. I have not seen this model
before. If the owner is on the list I would love to hear from you. The car
was dark green.
