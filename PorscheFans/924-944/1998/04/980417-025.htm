Bob,

How do you figure that?  In my business we provide a dry film lubricant
to customers with friction problems.  In the normal course of business I
have seen many many issues of galling.  Is sounds to me like this is a
perfect example of galling, except the block material is softer than the
bolt, so the bolt removed the threads upon removal instead if breaking
or just welding it's self in place.  As soon as I read the original post
my first thought was that anti seize was NOT used during assembly.  It's
a typical case of lack of lubrication with dissimilar metals.

Don't tell me you don't use anti seize on your lug nuts!!!  That's just
asking for trouble!

Just my professional opinion.

Actually, it's more likely to be that the use of anit-seize caused it.
