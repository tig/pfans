>Sounds like fixing the battery box has been a recent experience to some
list members.  Would anyone mind sharing some ideas w/ me about how to
completely remove existing rust and refinishing the area?  I am worried
about sanding it down since I do not want to remove the coating off that
lends the galvanizing properties to the Thyssen (sp?) steel.<

Menelaos,
     The amount of damage to the battery box will determine the best method

of repair.
      When I had to repair the battery box on my car, there was a lot of
rust
and water was leaking into the passenger footwell, but there were no
visible holes. After cleaning the area thoroughly of all paint chips and
other
debris, I used a rust converter made by Marhyde to prepare the rusted area.
Don't ask me exactly how it does it but, it converts the rust to a
paintable
surface. If you use this stuff make sure you wear gloves and don't get it
on
anything don't want permanently discolored. I then coated the entire inner
surface of the battery tray with a "brushable seam sealer" made by 3M.
This is the same stuff that coats all the rough painted surfaces you see
under the hood and under the carpet in the hatch area.  Once the seam
sealer
dries, it can be painted to the same color as the rest of the area under
the hood.
I've had no leaks for two years.
     If you have a number of visible holes in the tray, patching the areas
with
fiberglass and then repainting is the best option. It's a good idea to
treat the
rusted areas around the holes with the rust converter prior to patching.
     If you have large holes in the tray, your only option may be to have
the bottom
of the tray cut out and a new piece welded in.  It depends on how much
of the bottom is still intact.
