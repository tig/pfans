I am not sure as to the specifics on the 924, but if they are built the
same way the 944 is, i.e. Rear mounted transaxle, then the repair
although easy in itself is labor intensive.

I am currently working on this problem myself.  As a matter of fact, i
just got my tank back yesterday.  I have had my tank "Renu'd".  They
sandblast the tank fix any problems and coat it with some sealant and
guarantee it never to leak as long as I own the car.  It cost me about
$280.  

However, for me to get to the tank, I had to remove the muffler, axles
from the transaxle, the transaxle itself and the gas tank.  I am also
replacing all the hoses on the tank as well as the expansion chamber on
the tank itself.  I would say altogether that not including my labor, it
will cost around $400 for the complete job.  At a P-Shop figure at least
$1000.

Any other questions?  I would be happy to answer.
