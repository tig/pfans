Hello P-Fans,
It's been a while since I have contributed to the list, but I am glad to

know this pool of knowledge exists.  My 944 is currently in Honolulu,
Hawaii and I have been separated from her for awhile.  But, I am making
arrangements to bring the car to my new home in Houston and have a
couple of questions for you all.

The shipping company in Honolulu doesn't ship to Houston and will get my

car as far as L.A.  I don't feel comfortable driving the car from L.A.
to Houston and need to have it transported.  Does anyone know a company
in Houston or L.A. that does this?  Or, as an alternative, does anyone
know if there is a company that makes a tow bar for a 944?  I would
consider renting an U-haul for my household goods and flat towing the
car if there is a tow bar made for them.

I usually do most the work on my 944, but will not have access to the
tools I
have in Honolulu.  In the event my car needs work performed beyond my
resources or abilities, does anyone know a good shop, (i.e., won't rip
you off and treats your car like it was their own) in Houston?  Thanks
for any advice you can provide.  I'm really looking forward to joining
the Lone Star PCA.

Aloha,

Alex Thompson
