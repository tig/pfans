hey everyone,

i hope someone can guide me in the right and inexpensive direction.today
i was driving on the freeway about 90mph and hit a tire.it smashed into
the front end of my turbo.last month a rock cracked my winshield.i only
have liability insurance so i have to figure out this one by
myself.anyways,luckily the front end is in sound condition.my problem is
the paint,it did this spider type thing.it was perfect but now it looks
like spider webs.you cant feel it when you rub your nail across it and
it appears to be the depth of a light scratch.my question is can a
detailer buff it out.will it make the paint crack to the metal?should i
just repaint it?how much do you think it would cost to have the front
clip repainted at a reputable shop?any advice would be
appreciated.thanks!
