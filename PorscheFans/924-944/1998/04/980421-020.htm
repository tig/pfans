WOW!  190,000 psi!!  Alright, so what?  If it were tripple that, it
would still pull the threads out of the block like Farzaan's did right? 
Don't get me wrong, I love strong, manly, serious head studs as much as
the next guy...but a chain is as strong as it's weakest link right?  Now
someone make a titanium block, with titanium head studs and watch me
perk right up.  Outdated huh?  Uh-huh...they probably stretch on the
initial install so that they won't pull the bottom out of the block. 
You think?  Maybe I'm way off base here, and am fully admitting that
possibility, but Porsche built an exceptional engine here...maybe they
thought of this problem when they built the stretchies into the design.
