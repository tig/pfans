Question: wasn't the SUV supposedly a joint venture w/ Volkswagen? If
so, then they'd look similar just as how Ford and Mercury, Rolls-Royce
and Bentley, and so many other cars makers share chasis and body
designs.

	I wonder how much of an SUV would actually be Porsche's
design.... 
	Considering how different the design goals are for the current
Porsche
	niche of sports cars and what people expect from a Sport Ute.

	I don't know how involved they were in the initial phases, but
wasn't
	Porsche initially in on the M-Class, then backed out when they
couldn't
	have some things there way?  I think their complaint was that
the M-class
	was turning more and more into a big station wagon, when what
they had
	hoped for was a sportier, more rugged vehicle, just as well
suited for
	off-road racing as hauling lumber and the kid's soccer team.  I
kind of get
	a chuckle at the thought of Porsche complaining a vehicle wasn't
rugged
	enough....  My experiences (as limited as they are) tend to tell
me that
	was never at the top of their list of design goals before.

	I'm sure the story is told many ways, but that's how we heard it
at Becker
	when we were desigining some of the M-Class suspension pieces.
