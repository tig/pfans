Hi,

First of all thanks to Farzaan Kassam, Tim Richards, Bad Bob, David
Ganapol and Hahnmgh63 (!) for great descriptions of how turbos work,
likely problem areas and potential diagnostic approches.

The work so far has been undertaken at a generally well-respected UK
independent Porsche specialist. The cause of it originally was that the
car simply stopped just before Christmas and refused to start again. It
was towed home and, eventually, taken to the nearest Porsche
(independent) specialist. He diagnosed a faulty brain, replaced it with
a used unit, said the car worked, delivered it to me (this took c3
weeks) and I tried it out. It promptly stopped again three miles from
home in the countryside. This time I had it towed to the better Porsche
Specialist called Parrs. (UK readers - do not use Weston Porsche of
Beckenham. I categorically do not recommend them.)

Parrs found that two throttle valve switches and several sensors were
not working and one was broken in such a way to imply careless handling
by the previous garage (Weston.) Parrs said Weston had a reputation for
slip-shod work. Parrs systematically checked sensors and checked the DME
brain with a Bosch unit. The Bosch unit detected no fault codes.

They sent the brains (DME and KLR) away and they came back A1. 

Now the car exhibits the following :-

Normal (accelerator not depressed much) Turbo boost reading is 0.4 bar.
(The gauge has its first marked labelled 0.4 bar with the needle start
mark at an unlableed mark (possibly 0.2 bar). As the accelerator pedal
is depressed further the Turbo boost gauge increases to 1.2 bar but
never goes above that level.

There is no perceptible clutch slippage. The car does not have a
catalytic converter.

From Farzaan's mail this implies that the Turbo is spooling up but its
spooling has a limited effect or it doesn't spool fast enough. From the
various suggestions made so far the possible causes could be :

1. A kink in the throttle cable or other items that cause the wrong
signals to be picked up by the DME such that the DME dosen't tell the
Turbo to spool up. (But the Turbo does spool to 1.2 bar implying that
this isn't the case.) 
2. The wastegate could be stuck open or not working properly (e.g due to
vacuum pipe leak) such that the exhaust pressure isn't high enough to
spool the turbine wheel faster than the speed needed to produce 1.2 bar
pressure in the incoming air.
3. The compressor by-pass valve could be faulty.
It could be the cycling valve connnections as, if broken, they limit
boost to 1.2 bar and cause no error codes.
4. The intercooler could be faulty and somehow limit maximum boost to
1.2 bar. If the Turbo boost gauge sensor is between the intercooler and
the intake manifold then this could be the case. If the sensor is
between the Turbo compressor unit and the intercooler then this would
imply that the fault is ocurring before turbo-boosted air reaches the
intercooler.

It's unlikely to be a piping crack as this would reduce boost to zero
and the boost gauge wouldn't show a rise to 1.2 bar as the accelerator
pedal is depressed.

The likeliest problem areas would seem to be the wastegate and the
cycling valve. I'm seeing the proprietor of Parrs on Monday morning so
any further pointers would be real helpful.

Thanks ... Chris.
