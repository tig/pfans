Just a couple of questions.

I have a '87 924S Automatic 90K.

First last evening I developed a problem in the drive train.  I first
thought it was a bad u-joint.  Here are the symptoms.  When the car is
idling it sounds like there is a piece of cardboard tied to the flywheel
and is thumping against something.  When torque (accelerate) the noise
diminishes, still there just a subtle vibration, until you do engine
braking or exceed 3500 rpm.  The problem is consistent in any gear.
(PRND21)  My uneducated opinion is that the flex disk went out.  Had a
similar problem with my F-150 4x4 last week.  Am I close?

Next, Opinions on new Vs used flex disks.  New Disk is $750(AutoAlanta)
Vs used $350 (Local Auto Salvage).  

Lastly,  I am thinking of replacing this part myself.   Somewhat of an
accomplished mechanic (with books), but by no way an expert.  What is
the shop rate in hours for replacement and is there any additional
maintenance that should be done while in there.  (change tran. Fluid &
Filter, etc)

Once again I feel very fortunate to have such a resource of knowledge.  

Thank You,
