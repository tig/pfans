Hello David,

What kind of brake pads are you using? Some pads, Pagids for one, are known
to have 'material transfer' problems at the track. Basically what happens
is the pad get too hot and starts to melt. Some of the pad material sticks
or 'transfers' to the rotors. That causes the rotor to feel like it's
warped and you geel pulsing under braking. 

Later, after the pads cool, and you start to drive home, the material
gets scraped off the rotors and the brake no longer pulse. A few people
have stopped using Pagid pads for that reason.

Every 3 - 4 months. Generally, the higher the boiling point of the brake
fluid the more water the brake fluid will absorb, and the more often it
has to be changed.

Yes, you should use synthetic oil. IMHO, all turbo cars, and especially all
track driven cars should be using synthetic oil. Only synthetic oils can
handle the high stress and high shear loads your car will experience on
the track. Synthetic oils also reduce any 'coking' that can occur in the
turbocharger after you turn the engine off.

If anyone is interested in what I use, here's the story:

For brake pads, I use Performance Friction PF 80 pads for the track,
and Repco (or Axxis, whatever they're called now) Metalmasters on the
street. For serious track use, you need a dedicated track pad.  If
you're just starting, or aren't that serious about the track, or only
do a few days per year, you can use a good quality brake pad, like a
Performance Friction Z rated, stock OEM Textar or Jurid, Pagid,
Porterfield, or Hawk HPS. However, once you start getting fast, you
really should switch to a race type pad. Don't use the race pad on the
street, but do use it on the track. I started using PF 80 pads and
I've been very happy with them. I might try the PF 90 compound next,
but I'm not sure. A set of PF 80 pads lasts me about 10 track days
and costs about $135.

I use Ate brake fluid. Before that, I used Castrol GT LMA, but I boiled
it. I've never boiled the Ate, and I buy it for about $10 / litre.  So
changing the brake fluid 3 times a year costs less than $20.

In my car, I change the oil three times a year. I drive less than 5K miles
a year, but most of that is either on or to the track. I change the oil in
the spring, generally after my first event. In the middle of the summer
(or the season) and again at the end of season. That means I change the
oil after 3-4 events. I use Mobil1 10W 30 in the cool months (April - 
May, September - October), and 20W 50 (or whatever the 50W is, but not
5W 50) June - August. With Mobil 1 about $4/quart, my oil costs is
less than $100 / year, including filters.

Now just don't get me started on track fees, tires, safety equipment,
performance upgrades, and other items that make up the track budget.
