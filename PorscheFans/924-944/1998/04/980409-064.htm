I spent some time "playing" with the speed sensor height and this
doesn't seem to make tremendous difference.  The engine seems to have
the same symptoms: sometimes runs great all the time OR sometimes runs
rough in idle, runs very rough in at mid pedal, and runs fine when past
the resistance point in the pedal.  RPM range have no effect, and this
speed sensor seem to have little effect.  I will replace the sensor
next.  In the meantime, is there anything else that causes these
symtoms?  Should I pay the money and have the dealer put it on his
computor?

P.S.   Although it seems a little "backyard mechanic-ish", I recieved
several emails that said, "Let the sensor down until the pin taps it and
raise it a little"  Is that Porsche approved? :o)
