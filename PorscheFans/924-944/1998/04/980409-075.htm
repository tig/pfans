Dave
Sounds like your cruise control servo to me.  I have the same problem with my
1987 944S.  To say the least my cruise is not working.  The noise bugged me to
the point that I disconnected the cables coming into the servo.  The sound
mine made was like that of the cards in the spokes of our bicycle wheels when
we were young ( you did do this didn't you Dave? ). The sound occurred mostly
when I was backing up.  My cruise stopped working long before the noise
started so I am not saying that the problem is the servo alone.  I suspect the
cruise module or "brain" is gone in mine too.  Someone recently posted that
they disassembeled their servo and cleaned the contacts inside with a contact
cleaner and that this helped them.  I did this but it did no good for me.  If
you can gather anymore info. on the problem I would be interested to know what
the fix is myself.  
I know I have not helped you with the problem but at least you know you are
not alone.  For what that's worth.
