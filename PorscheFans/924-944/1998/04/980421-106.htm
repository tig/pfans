Subject: Re: engine roar

Mr. Karamichalis,
	Thank you for responding to my question. I was not exactly clear
in my description of the noise. It does not sound like an exhaust leak.
When travelling at a constant speed, or accelerating in any gear the noise
is not constant but rather a rythym.  There is also a vibration present
which can be felt in the accelerator and in the seat. It feels like a wave
comes through the engine. When accelerating it becomes faster.  There is
also a different vibration present at 3000 rpm.  
	In the old service records there is a mention of the exhaust
manifold, it was not replaced, but the owner just asked for an estimate.
The motor mounts were replaced about six months ago,  timing belt 15000
miles ago, and a minor tune up about 5000 miles ago. The plug wires look
old, they are a little cracked. The distributor was replaced a year ago.
	I am not sure how to describe it, the engine feels like it wants
to go but it is being held back. If you have any more ideas please let me
know, and thank you once again.

Charles Strickland
