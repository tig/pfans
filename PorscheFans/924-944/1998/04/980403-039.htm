Hi,

This is mainly for Randall.  I spoke to Dave B. for you regarding the
Profec installation.  He said he used to have MANY problems setting these
things up and thinks the engineers' brains were the fuzzy ones, not the
boost controller.  But, now that Greddy has put instructions online, he
hasn't had a single call in a long time and he's programmed many using
the web instructions.  They can be found at:
http://www.greddy.com/profecguide.html

In addition to that, he mentioned that it is best to start a low boost level
such as 0.5bar for about 1 week.  Let the unit learn your boost curves over
that week, then turn it up.  If you go straight to 1.0bar off the bat, the
unit will spike occassionaly as it learns to deal with different temps,
etc.

Lastly, I noticed that you mentioned the unit was connected after the boost
bolt and before the cycling valve.  If I read incorrectly, I apologize and
ignore this.  The purpose of using a controller is to eliminate the APE
boost bolt and the cycling valve from the equation.  The bolt used should
be stock and the cycling valve should be put away in a closet somewhere.

Going kart racing again tommorow.  I had a nasty spill in my garage a few
days ago and bruised my ribs.  I think this kart race will be a very painful
experience, but I'm sure I'll feel better if I do well :)
