Ok Folks, here's the story on Koni's and your 944. 

83-85 These units have been available in both standard red and sport yellow
applications. Recently, Koni discontinued the red rear shock (26-1209). We
still have some, but after these are gone we won't be able to get any more.
Almost all of these cars have rebuildable struts, so the front just gets an
insert (8641-1038 or 8641-1038 Sport) which is externally adjustable for
rebound. The rears are standard adjustable (26-1209 or 26-1209 Sport) , you
have to remove them to adjust.

85.5 on NA These cars use a different rear unit which is standard adjustable
and are available in both standard red or sport yellow (8040-1035 or
8040-1035 Sport). The fronts struts on these cars can be either rebuildable
or non-rebuildable. If they are rebuildable you will use the 8641-1038 Red
or Sport insert. If they are non rebuildable, you will use the 8741-1136 L&R
Sport strut. These are externally adjustable for rebound and have a fixed
lower perch. These units can be converted to double adjustable (rebound and
compression). Our experience has been that all 944 Turbo's (non S) and all
the 944S models have non rebuildable front struts.

Turbo S, These cars have a Koni single adjustable (rebound), ride height
adjustable front strut from the factory. This unit is still available from
Porsche or you can purchase the 8742-1007 L&R Sport struts that Koni is
building for the aftermarket. These units are now double adjustable (rebound
and compression) as well as having the ride height adjustment. They can be
fitted to other 944 models, but remember, Koni is assuming you are
installing them on a car that already has this setup so you don't get the
lower spring perch or jam nut. You can source these parts through Porsche or
try to come up with a lesser expensive option in the aftermarket. The Turbo
S cars ran a conical front spring. They are smaller diameter on the bottom
than on the top. Your standard 944 or 944 Turbo springs wont work on these
units without modification. The rear units for these cars will be the
8040-1035 Sport.

S2, 968, (non M030)These cars also ran a bit of a conical shaped front
spring. The front units for these cars is the 8741-1237 L&R Sport. Because
they used a conical shaped front spring, the lower perch on these units is
smaller than the 8741-1136 Sport. NOW, these are the units that are not
available. After Koni USA's supply ran out, we bugged them enough (actually
committed to buy a bunch) t0 order some more units from Holland. When
Holland produces units, they don't make a few at a time, they do production
run of usually 100 units. We thought that the ball was rolling on these and
we were waiting for an ETA from Holland. The bad news is that Holland has
come back recently and said that they will not be producing the units. We
don't know why as of yet, as a full production run had been ordered. These
units haven't been huge movers in the past, but obviously, as time passes,
more and more of these cars will be in the need of shocks. We haven't given
up yet, but as of now, they isn't any light at the end of the tunnel. Koni
USA does have some left units but no rights which doesn't help much. I'll
try to keep you posted on what happens.

In the mean time S2 and 968 owners can either use the 8741-1136 Sport units
with the diffent spring, or go to the 8742-1007 Sport units with the
necessary springs, perches and jam nuts.
