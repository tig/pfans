> Hello everyone,

Hello Brian,

Sounds very nice.

> $6.9k and I think it has 107k mi. on it. I need advice from owner's

The price is in the ballpark.

> want to get into big trouble after I buy it!!

Brian, I don't want to rain in your parade, but I'm not sure this
is the car for you. These can be great cars, but they are not
cheap. I know the purchase price is cheap (especially when compared
to new cars like Saturn's and Honda's) and these cars are NOT
cheap to operate.

>   Could you also give me estimates on average yearly costs for
> maintenance/repair?

Who is working on the car? If it's you, and you shop around for parts,
these cars can be reasonable. However, if you have to pay for
maintenance, and if you need to rent something to drive when your car
is in the shop, then the price goes up A LOT.

I'm not saying you shouldn't buy the car. Just think long and hard about
what kind of car you want, and how much it's going to cost to operate.

Good luck,
