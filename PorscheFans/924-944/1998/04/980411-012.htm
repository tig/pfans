I took a prospective 944 down to the dealership for a
pre-purchase inspection.  For anyone who would ever skip
out on this, let me tell you it was the best 80 dollars I
ever spent.

So let me tell you the story...

It's a 1984 944.  It appeared to have just some minor
flaws here and there, just like any 14 year old car would.
 It has a new clutch, new tires, and a recent (1996)
timing belt change.

When the mechanic was done looking at it, he showed me
everything the car had to offer.  Turns out that there
were a few more problems with the car.  The right-front
motor mount had completely collapsed.  The right-front
tire needed the bearings re-packed.  It was leaking oil
from 3 different places.  It also needs a brake job.  The
AC compressor didn't work, and it needed some fluid flushes.

The guy was asking 4000 for the car.  The total repair
bill to put the car in "A" condition would cost roughly
2800 dollars.  I offered him 2500 so I could cover the
repairs.  Is that so unreasonable?  How much would you
expect to see a car in this condition go for?
