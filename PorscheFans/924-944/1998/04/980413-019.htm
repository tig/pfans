OK, My car failed smog miserably, so I took it to the dealer.  He leaned
out the mixture (a lot) and it passed smog easily and looks very healthy.
I figured this would also cure the cold running problem.  Unfortunately,
this has had no effect on the problem.  About 1 minute after start up the
car loses all power for 3-4 minutes and then all of a sudden, the power
returns and the car runs great.  After going through all of the Haynes
tests, I have found that there is no power going to the auxilary air
regulator under the intake manifold.  The resistance looks good, just no
power.  My question is, how do I get power there.  Should I just splice a
hot wire from the battery, or from a circuit that is live with the key on,
or do I need to try to trace the power wire to find the fault?  What does
the power do--  heat the sensor, or provide feedback to the DME?

Does the poor warm up seem like a possible result of the aux air regulator
not having power?  Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks.
