>What is a realistic price for a 968 in Western US (prefer Washington)
>or in the B.C. area of Canada?  How much more are the M030 cars.  The
>968 would have to be a early model (92?).

There is (was?) a white '95 6-sp available locally (SE Michigan).  I
was out of town for a week and haven't checked back with the dealer
since getting back.  It's white with a medium brown interior.  Looks
pretty well loaded, 16" wheels but no M030 option.  Only drawback is
mileage - 55K if I remember correctly.  I saw it before it was cleaned
up by the dealer, and was already in very good to excellent condition
except for a 3/4" diameter paint chip on the front end were the paint
seems to be peeling.  I think they told me they were asking $24.9K -
if so I'm guessing they could be talked down to around $22K.
