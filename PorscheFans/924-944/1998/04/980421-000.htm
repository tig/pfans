I was seriously thinking about investing in a Porsche 951, but after
reading these pages on top of pages about problems on top of problems I am
really starting to reconsider.  Originally I came to the understanding
that if properly taken care of these cars would run forever, but now I am
not so sure.  All these problems that I am reading about, do these happen
to every car, even the ones that have been taken care of?  I know that
they require alot of maintenance, but it is starting to seem like even if
this maintenance is preformed I am still going to be in a world of hurt.
Is all this TLC (tender loving care) worth the excitement and joy of
owning a Porsche 951.  Even if I get a car that has been excellently
maintained, am I still going to run into all these problems.  I love to
drive and am very good at it, but I am not really into all the mechanical
stuff.  It sounds like I am going to be spending an arm and a leg just to
keep this thing in running order. Is this true?  If I have the car checked
out by a certified mechanic, is the car likely to develop hidden problems
down the road?  I want a reliable, daily driven car.  Is the 951
completely out of the question?  I have a 1997 Eclipse GS-T that is not
only a kick in the pants to drive, but I know that every time I put the
key in and turn it is going to start.  I like that.  As a shopper, and
first time potential Porshce buyer I would gladley take anyone's advice
from these pages.  It sounds like you have all been around the block a few
times with these cars.  By the way the Mitsubishi is for sale!!! Also if
anyone knows of any 951's for sale in my area (Indianapolis, IN) please
let me know.  I will trust and accept your advice.  If you tell me this is
not the car for me, so be it ( I will be disappointed though).
