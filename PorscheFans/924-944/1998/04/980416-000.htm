Please help!

I have play in my front steering, and still can't find the 
answer even after the following:

1. replace wheel bearings by Porsche dealer (expensive!)
2. have wheel bearings tightened by another mechanic after 
Porsche dealer did a lousy job
3. have tie ends, shocks, etc. checked by mechanic who 
declared everything OK
4. double checked everything myself - can't see anything 
obviously wrong but can feel slight play in wheels

Interestingly the play is only front to back not up and 
down ie: if I put my hand on the top and bottom of the tire 
and push and pull there's no movement but when I do this 
with my hand on the front and rear of the tire there's 
quite abit of movement

Every time I race (POC SoCal events) the tech guys ALWAYS 
tell me to tighten my wheel bearings, and it's now got to 
the stage where they're not going to let me race again 
until I get this fixed (probably rightly so).

I'm so exasperated - why can't I find a good mechanic!  
(Please let me know if you have one in the LA area).

I'm hoping someone on the list can help.

Thanks.
