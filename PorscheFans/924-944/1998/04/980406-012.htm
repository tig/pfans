     In an air conditioning service, it was revealed that my expansion 
     valve needed to be replaced.  The ouch is that, by the book, this 
     calls for about 10 hours of labor to replace this valve.  Does anyone 
     know of an easier way or a short cut to replace this valve?  Is their 
     any easy way to or through the expansion box?  This vehicle is a daily 
     driver and is in good, but not concours condition, so I'm open to any 
     suggestions.  Replacing this valve is on top of a timing belt service 
     and some other odds and ends, so if their is any short cut I can pass 
     on to my tech, I would really appreciate it.
     
     TIA,
