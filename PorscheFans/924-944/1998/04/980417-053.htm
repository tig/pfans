First a disclaimer.  I do not own an APE MAF unit, nor do I intend on getting
one.  If I were able to get one used cheap, I would consider it, but not
at retail.  For that much money, I'd rather just take the plunge and go
for a custom aftermarket unit or a custom programming of the chips.  But,
anyways, I wanted to compare the differences between the hot wire sensors
and the flapper door.

As I said, I've never had anything but the door on my 944T so I'm 
going to go back to the haydays of my Talon (now that was a money pit!).
The Talons come with a really sophisticated engine management system with
a hot wire mass air flow meter and all the goodies like our car has
(knock sensors, boost retardation, timing retard, etc, etc.)  The Talon
computer is even set up to take advantage of race gas (keeps advancing
the timing until it hears knock and then backs it down to keep it at
the ragged edge).

Unfortunately, the stock MAF sensor was a small diameter unit that was
restrictive and only had capacity to measure a certain amount of air.
So, if you wanted to go really fast in these cars, you had to toss the
hot wire sensor and go for something else.  Since aftermarket ECU's were
not available in the configuration I wanted, I went with the HKS VPC,
which changes the intake system to a speed density system using a BMAP
sensor and a temp sensor.  From all I've been able to see, this system
is similar to the Porsche system, just that a BMAP sensor was used instead
of the flapper door.

The immediate differences noticed were more turbo lag, worse throttle
response, slightly rougher idle and less precise tuning.  By less precise
tuning, I mean that the car would sometimes bog on cold nights or have a 
rough idle in wet weather, etc.  The factory 944T idle is anything but
smooth compared to today's cars, but still smoother than most race cars.

Now, interestingly enough, on the Talon, the speed density system gives
you more power because of less restriction, whereas on the 944T, they
claim it the other way around.  So, everything you've read above would
make it seem that the MAF would give better throttle response, more power
due to less restriction, and a smoother running car.  Personally, I can
believe that, but with all things, there are always catches.

Before you can realize more power, you have to ask if the restriction in
the intake system is enough to show a gain when removed.  I don't know
the answer to that since I have not done backpressure tests, etc. but
I would venture to guess that little is gained at stock boost levels or
even at 1bar with the stock turbos in terms of restriction.  However, if
I had a stroker with a K27, I would say that the door would be reaching
its limits and an open hot wire sensor would make a significant improvement.

So, why do people with stock motors feel such a gain with the MAF even
if they had Stage II chips before?  I think they are actually being honest.
With a more precise method of measuring intake air, the computer can
more precisely provide the fuel and when things are more precise, you
can run them closer to the edge.  I know with the Talon, when we went
speed density, we had to fatten the mixture to account for odd weather
conditions that may cause detonation, even though the VPC had a temp
sensor, etc.  By having more precise fueling and air measurement, the engine
can produce more HP and Torque and the timing can be run more advanced or
see less detonation.

So then, why do racers call the unit a "cash flow device"?  I think they
are also right.  For their purposes, having more low end power or better
response is worthless.  If I am racing my car or running track days,
I'd rather put the $1700 into a driver training course or better yet,
a BIG honkin' turbo.  I could care less about throttle response.  As
my kart coach says, "A real race car doesn't idle!"  Don't worry,
he's from the olden days of carbs, etc.  I know the GT1 idles and it's
a real race car :)

In the end, is the unit right for you?  I don't know, you have to
decide what you want.  I still think, bang for the buck, get a set of
Stage II chips, call up your local PCA chapter, grab the 944 instructor
and go.  Keep the MAF money for the eventual head gasket that you will
need and keep some spare change for a block in case the threads strip :)

Hopefully, I shed some light on the subject.
