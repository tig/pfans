Hi, Pfans

I did a few modifications to my car over the winter and just got back 
from the first track day yesterday. 
The car performed beautifully and I am very happy with the mods.

First I installed the adjustable KONIs front and back from Jason @ 
Paragon  with KMR camber plates and Brey - Krause camber brace.  
The car is nicely tossable now and easy to play with at the limits.
-1.5 degree camber front and back helps to keep the tires square.

ITis amazing how much these mods changed the handling of the car.
The stock shocks are way too loose and the top strut bushings (now 
replaced with KMR camber plates) were shot.

I also installed additional oil cooler from KISS Engineering, brake 
cooling kit from OZ Racing, Authothority short shifter kit and 
removed the cat.

I also put in three HKS gauges under the radio from STILLEN. Engine 
oil temp., boost gauge and tranny oil temp. I ordered white faces 
with black numbers and they look cool down there! 
Oil temp sensors are installed in the oil drain plugs.

The oil temperature would come upto 120C (250F) under full racing 
conditions and drop to 110C (230F) after one cooling lap.  What is 
amazing the car did not use any oil during yesterday 100 track miles
compared to 1litter of oil that dissapered every 100 track miles 
before the oil cooler was installed. 
The 951 run way too hot on the oil side , even on the street.
I run MOBIL 1,   15-50W.   

I removed the stock CAT pipe and replaced the main and wastegate CAT
with straight SS pipes. Than the whole pipe was ceramic coated. The 
reason why I did not go with an aftermarket test pipe is:
         I like the double wall on the stock pipe for better 
         vibration, noise and temperature control.
         It is cheaper than good quality aftermarket test pipe.
The car is not noisier at all now just the exhaust tone got deeper 
under WOT.

The car is definitelly faster at upper end. I gained about 5 miles at 
the end of the straight 130miles/hr  versus 125miles/hr before the 
mods. The engine feels more free to rev above 5000 RPM. 
I do not know  if the performance increase is due the removed cat or 
the cooler running engine, both mods were installed at the same time.
Probably combination of both. 
I believe that keeping the engine cool is a cheap insurance against 
head gasket failure and #2 rod bearing troubles.

The tranny oil temp comes upto 80C (176F) under full racing 
conditions , so no problem there.

I already had the big Turbo S POWERHOUSE modified brakes. With the 
cooling kit installed I got less rotor grooving (almost none) and 
needed less pressure on the brake pedal. Actually had to be carefull 
not to lock the front wheels at the end of the straight!

The car is a joy to race now, even as I keep the stock springs and 
sway bars. The engine is bone stock for now. (No chips).

Yesterday it was my third time at the track  and with my car we made 
a good progress.

WE run two groups at our club. Group 1 -unlimited , fast and 
aggresive and  Group 2 -for lower HP cars.

Last year on my first track day I was only able to pass two cars in
Group 2.  Yesterday we were passing cars left and right . The car 
felt wonderfull and I pushed it to drift in the corners. We got a 
black flag at the end of the day.  The marshall told us that we are 
having too much fun in Group 2 and kicked us into Group 1.
What a day!

Life is tough in Group 1. We've got 500HP One lap of America Toyota 
Supra TT there, Ferrari 355's, GT40, whole wolf pack of BMW M3's,
Nitro Acura NSX's, pure race cars including 470HP Mustang and 
modified cars with excellent, experienced drivers.
I will only run my stock 217 HP motor this year and do not have any 
other mods in the pipe except for a set of 225/245 Michelin MXX3's
to replace my old worn 205/225 D40's. Hopefully they'll keep us from 
being run over by the big cats!   
 
Sent only once! (in case the software hicks up)
