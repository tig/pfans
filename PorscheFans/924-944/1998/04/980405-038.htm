Last month I purchased an early 1985 944; extremely clean, extremely chea=
p,
and extremely fun. After following a recent thread I am in the midst of
changing the timing belt (cheap insurance).  Problem one, the distributor=

rotor seems severely stuck.  I have removed the allen screw and can detec=
t
nothing more holding it on.  Is that correct?  If so, I will probably hav=
e
to sacrifice the rotor to remove it.  If not, what=92s the trick?  I fear=
 the
paint like material that was filling the screw head may have been used as=
 a
threadlock compound.  If so, then extra material may be gluing the rotor
on.
Problem two, antifreeze leaks from a plastic fitting (like a hose
connection to nowhere) that is on the water pump discharge/thermostat
housing.  What is this part?  My Haynes and owners manuals do not show it=
=2E =

Seems to be a just leaky gasket but I don=92t know what to call the silly=

thing.  For what it=92s worth, the timing belt looks very old.

Thanks in advance
