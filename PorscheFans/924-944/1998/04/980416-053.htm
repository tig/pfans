Howdy,
When I had this exact symptom, it turned out to be a leaking fuel pump.
(On my 87 NA 944). It was not repairable, so my mechanic installed a new
one for about $200 US inluding parts and labor. The hoses were all fine.

You were kind enough to write:

I am experiencing a new problem with my '87 944... I must confess I =
haven't fully investigated this yet, but I am now getting a fuel leak
from the back end of the car once it has been shut down after driving
(all =
appears OK when driving).    I haven't taken a good look underneath yet,
but does anyone care to speculate what might be happening. (Its not
coming from the tank area,
but rather somewhere in, or around the fuel lines/fittings)
