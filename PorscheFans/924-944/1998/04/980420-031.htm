I have an '87 951. The cycling valve is located at the rear of the engine,
between cylinders 1 and 2, and has a cream colored cap on it. It is round
and about the size of a 50 cent piece. If you look at it in your car, (with
adequate light) I think you will be able to see the way it is installed and
how it can be removed.

When I installed aftermarket chips on my car, part of the installation was
to remove the cycling valve and "drill" it. I did this myself with no
special tools, and I can guarantee you I did not remove the intake
manifold. (I'm also not a mechanic, just brave). I think you are getting BS.

Mike
