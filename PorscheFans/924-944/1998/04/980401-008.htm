OK, I have ANOTHER question about the airbag resetting procedure.  I was
looking at the procedure in the FAQ, and it talks about running a wire
from this test clip, to the driver's seat, then a ground from the
drivers seat to a door latch.  What can't I just run the first wire to a
ground instead of going to the driver's seat, then to ground??  Below is
a blurb from the FAQ for reference:

Pin # 2 is where you must connect a wire and run it to the drivers seat.
Connect a ground lead (for example, the metal door latch on the
passenger door) from ground and run it to the drivers seat. You will do
a series of connections and disconnection to the two ends of the wires
to  perform the Air Bag reset procedure, so go ahead and take a seat in
the drivers seat and have our keys ready. Oh, you will need a watch with
a second hand to count time. Remember that this is a German car so be
punctual about your timing.

THANKS AGAIN!
