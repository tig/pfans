Hello,

I just completed an awesome performance modification on my
89 951, and I wanted to let you in on the secret.

A few weeks ago, a few friends and I were disussing ways of
increasing the performance of our Porsches. One friend is
a 911 expert. He told us that a common 911 mod is to 
install the cams from a 73 911 S into a mid 80's 911. The S
cams have more lift and duration. By using that cam in
a later 911 engine, you get a lot more performance. 

So we started thinking, why not use the same idea for a 
944? We could take the cam from a 944 S, and install it
in a 944 turbo, and take advantage of the surperior performance.
The 944 S has 190 HP, while the 944 only has 150 HP. So by
installing the S cam in my car, I should be able to increase
the performance from 250HP to 290HP!

Well, last weekend we did it, and I can proudly say that
it worked great! It was a bolt in modification, piece of cake
using regular hand tools. It was a pain timing the new cam,
and of course I had to get the timing belt tensioned. Luckily,
my car has the autotensioner, so that was easy.

Sunday we took the car over to a local shop for some dyno
runs. Seat of the pants testing on the way over showed the
car felt a lot faster. Boy would it rev! We used a Dynojet dyno, 
ran in 4th gear with stock chips, injection, boost, etc.  Anway, 
on the dyno, I aw 250HP at the rear wheels! That should equate to 
around 300 HP at the flywheel. Right on the money! Just imagine how
much power there would be if I chipped it!

The best thing about this mod is that 944 S cams are cheap and
easy to come by. So many 944S's have broken heads that the
cams are available for dirt cheap. And, since each 944S has
two cams, you can convert 2 standard 944's for each 944S
engine you use. Just give the local Porsche dismantler a call, 
and ask for a 944 S Cam, or SCAM.
