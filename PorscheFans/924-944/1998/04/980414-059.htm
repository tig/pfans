I think I can answer your question about the clock light.  I'm not sure 
if you can remove the bulb once the glovebox is out, but removing the box 
is pretty simple.  Once you open the glovebox door, there should be one 
screw on each side of the opening that attaches the box to the dash.  
Remove these, as well as one screw that attaches the box at the top (it's 
behind the latch).  Pry out the glovebox light and disconect the two 
leads.  You should now be able to pull out the glovebox (some gentle 
bending of the box may be necessary to clear the opening).

If you can't access the light bulb, you'll need to remove the plastic 
trim piece that the clock attaches to.  To do this, pry out the plastic 
cover to the left of the passenger side vent that covers two screws (do 
this carefully to avoid breaking the tabs on the cover).  Remove the two 
hidden screws.  With the passenger door open, remove the plastic cover at 
the right side of the dash (parallel to the door, one screw in the 
middle of the panel).  Remove the screw behind this that is around the 
corner from the vent.  Remove the grill that covers the temperature 
sensor tube located to the left of the lighter.  Do this by rotating the 
grill 90 degrees counter-clockwise (you can use a screwdriver between the 
fins to turn it gently).  Remove the screw behind the grill.  Remove the 
two vent control control knobs in the center of the heater/AC control by 
pulling or prying off.  Carefully pry off the heater/AC plastic trim 
surround (it is a press fit that attaches by gripping the center area of 
the control).  There will be four screws that attach the control unit to 
the dash.  Remove these and you can then pull off the long trim panel 
that houses the clock, lighter, vent, etc.  You will have to pull the 
trim panel past the right vent control knob (the knob will slide between 
the vent grill with a bit of pressure).  You should now have easy access 
to the clock light (you may need to disconect the lighter and hazard 
light leads to get clearance).
