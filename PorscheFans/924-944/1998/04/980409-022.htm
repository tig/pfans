Subject: Another Start problem on 78-924

Hi all P-fans,

Many Thanks to all who responded to my "heavy clutch" problem.
Here is another "start" problem with my 78-924.

The motor can start but it stalled immediately when the key is return back
to "ON" position.
Try again with the key at "start" position for a few second, it do respond
to the acceleration.
But when I let go the key, back to "ON" position, the motor stalled
immediately.
I listen carefully for the fuel pump's ' humming' sound, the fuel pump is
running. 
I pull the fuel pump relay out and test it, the relay is O.K.
Here is a few question I'm in doubt.

Does the fuel pump relay has a auxiliary contact 
Which hold the relay closed after you start the engine ?
Does the fuel pump has any other rely/fuse other than the one on the fuse
box ?
If the CIS system is part of the problem, What should I start with ?

The Ignition system on these cars has a ballasted coil supply. This means
that when the engine is being cranked the coil is fed from the starter
motor circuit (terminal 16 on the starter according to the Haynes book) to
ensure full voltage at the coil under starting load. When the key is
released back to the normal run position the coil is fed through the
ballast resistor or resistor wire on some models. If the resistor is open
circuit the car will start but wont keep running. I am not sure of the
location of the actual resistor but it should be somewhere near either the
coil or electronic ignition module, If your car has a ballast wire it is
the wire from the ignition switch to the coil. Replacement resistors are
sold at most autoparts stores as these items are common to a lot of cars.
For a quick check place a voltmeter between the positive terminal of the
coil and the cars body.
When cranking the reading will be between 7-12 volts, In the run position
it should be between 6-10 volts.
Good luck. 
Martin
