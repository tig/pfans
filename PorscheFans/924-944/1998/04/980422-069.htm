Hi,

I went to my shop last night and we had a good talk.  Stuart's brain was
going a million miles an hour to come with alternatives to spending $8,500
for the new block.  Just for future reference, the price of C$6,900 for
a short block does not include a $1500 core charge.  The nice thing was
that many of his recommendations were similar to what I've read here and
what was sent to me privately.  It's always good to hear stuff like that
because you know then that the shop is thinking of the customer's best
interests, rather than only their bottom line.  I was a happy camper 
yesterday, about the first time I've been happy in the last two weeks.

As it sits right now, the block will be completely out today, shipped to
the machine shop dude tommorow and hopefully back on Monday or Tuesday.
I might even have my car back by the first local Regional auto-x on May 3rd.

Anyhow, getting back to my original reason for posting, maintenance costs.
I don't like to scare potential 951 owners away and I feel I may have done
that yesterday, but I have an idea why some cars cost much more than others
to run.

1. When a car is tracked, it does put more stress on the engine and
drivetrain.
2. Any kind of "drop-clutch" standing starts reduce the clutch life.
3. Increasing the boost reduces the MTBF of head gaskets to about 40k miles.
   Factory boost seems to blow them anywhere from 60k miles to infinity.
4. Auto-x seems to eat up CV joints for whatever reason.  Perhaps because
   most auto-x cars are lowered and put the joints at odd angles.  I don't
   know, any theories out there?
5. This is the most important one.  Check to see what was already done on
   the car before purchase.

I'll ellaborate on #5 above.  Let's take Tom's son's car as an example.
They've spent close to nothing on that car and they've even tracked it
once.  In comparison, I've spent a lot more on my car.  Now, from what
I understand, Scott's car had the clutch replaced and the head gasket
already done.  Those are both items I will have to do at some time
(head gasket was the original reason why the car was in the shop when
the head stud problem happened).  Those two items alone could bump the
maintenance costs up by $3000 + $1300 = $4300.

Also, because I have a warranty on the car (a warranty I've been very happy
with BTW), when things do break, we don't take ANY corners at all and even
go a bit overboard, or do everything by the book so to speak.  For example,
when the control arm's balljoints were worn, the book says replace the arms,
so the warranty company says replace the arms.  Almost no owner would
pay $3000 to replace the arms.  I would send them to Dynamic and spend $400
getting them done and a few hours labour to re&re and re-align.  Could have
the whole thing fixed for $1000.

When all the cosmetic stuff is taken out of the equation and tires are
taken out (I run street tires in auto-x and track events so I eat a set of
rears once a year and replace all four at that time), my maintenance costs
would only have been $6000 for 20 months (this is assuming doing things like
an owner would rather than the warranty wanted).  I don't think anything
will break in the next four months, so let's say it's $6000 for two years,
which is $3000 per year or US$2000 per year.  That's cheap for this kind
of performance.  Having said that, big things can break.  I've seen 944T's
in the shop with badly scored cylinder walls from the head gasket leaking
and washing down the cylinders with water;  water is not a good lubricant.
I've seen broken R&P's on 944's, broken gear boxes, seized motors, pulled
head studs [:)], lots and lots of head gaskets, water pumps and even 
yesterday, for the first time in ages, a 944NA with a broken timing belt.
Whoever you are, I feel for you man!

I think in the end, this may help you make your decision.  I'm not a rich
person, I don't make "up-start computer dude" kind of money, but if need
be, I will get the $10k needed to fix my 951 so that I can have it back
again to drive.  Not to sell, to continue to drive until I either die in
the thing at 280km/h or it gets smushed by someone else.
