> Now,
it's up to me to duke it out with the shop.  I'm not sure what resolution=

we will come up with, but I now need to decide which way to go.<

Farzaan,

Bad luck about the warranty.  As for the cause of the stud pulling out, I=

don't think it is the shop's fault.  I discussed this with my engine
builder and for once he agreed with me.  I think the reason you blew the
head gasket on #1 was that the stud had already pulled loose.  My builder=

agrees with what the others have said about the Timeserts.  The hole that=

the studs goes into is just slightly larger than the threaded end of the
stud.  To install a insert, the hole which is about 6" deep would have to=

be bored out so the insert would fit down it.  I'm not sure what effect t=
he
oversized hole would have on the strength of the block.  My builder just
said trying to repair this "would be a bitch".  For Mr. Machine to say th=
at
means a new block may be in your future.  He couldn't believe that with t=
he
length and diameter of the stud threads that it would pull out. =


I'll ask him again now that I know you are on the hook for the cost of th=
e
repair.  He was a bit preoccupied today and his thought process wasn't th=
e
best.  The loft over his office that I built had a supporting post that
appeared to be buckling.  Just the thought of all those engine blocks,
heads and cranks crashing down had him reaching in to grab the phone and
pulling it out into the shop bay.  He saw no humor in my remark that he
should of hired a licensed contractor if he didn't want the loft to fall
down.  Anyway, the beam was just warped and hardly had any load on it,
however he was unconvinced that his office was safe.  I replaced the 4 x =
6
with a steel support post that I had just to ease his mind and to get him=

off my back.  He was so relieved that he promised to finish welding and
flowing my intake manifold this weekend.  Now if I can just figure how to=

get another beam to buckle, I can get the rest of my engine finished.  =


If your cylinder walls are good, you may want to call Kelly-Moss and see
what they would charge to install an insert.  Once the block is stripped =
of
parts, you should be able to UPS it to them.

To answer your stud stretching question, yes the 944 studs do return to
their original state when the torque is removed and they are reuseable. =

There are some (911? I think) that have to be replaced as they are design=
ed
to stretch and stay stretched. =


The warranty company should still be on the hook for the cost of reassemb=
ly
from the blown headgasket.  See if your shop will credit your account for=

that amount,  Have the car towed to your garage and pull the engine
yourself.  When the block is repaired/replaced, tow it back to them for
reassembly.  This might save you a few bucks.  =
