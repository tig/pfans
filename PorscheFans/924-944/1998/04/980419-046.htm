Dave:

I had huge brake fade problems with my 911, and installed cooling kits, bigger
calipers, better pads, etc.  Turns out the best thing was set of new rotors.
Try this if you haven't yet.

I recently lowered my 1989 S2 slightly all around and had it fully aligned.
with as much negative camber as I could get with the stock setup.  (Actually,
it's not completely stock--it has 951S adjustable springs and shocks all the
way ariound and camberballs up front.)  Lowering the rear helps these cars a
lot with their front/rear brake bias.  They come from the factory set high in
the rear tomeet U.S. bumper height restrictions.  Nevertheless, expect a lot
more dust up front than in the rear.  The fronts do most of the braking.
