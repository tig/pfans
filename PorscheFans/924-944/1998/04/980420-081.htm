After spending a week at a local import shop, here are the results:
new cap and rotor and plugs,
replaced both speed sensors and block above the front flywheel,
and still have the same problem.

Car is '87 944 na w/ auto trans.

Here's the problem:
When cold, very rough idle and rough at mid pedal.  Runs great after the
pedal is pushed past the resistance point.
When hot, changes from running great all the time to the same as above.

Again, RPM range doesn't seem to affect the problem.  This seems to be a
"how far the pedal is pushed or intake is opened type problem".  Smokes
black at full throttle but plugs come out perfect gray/tan everytime.

I'm really open to any suggestions.  The mechanic wants to check fuel
pressures, etc. but I am guessing electrical since the problem seems to
"switch on and off" intermittently.  Only I can't seem to link the prob
with anything else.  Bad fuel injector maybe?
Thanks for the help. (past and future)  -Rich
