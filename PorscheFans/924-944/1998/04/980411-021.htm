David,

How was your trip to Parts Haven?  I hope you got a great deal on a
bunch of stuff!.

Friday I did block off the idle air valve, and the car wouldn't boost at
all.  I really think I just need to replace the oil trap and go from
there.

I haven't touched the car today.  As i said before I was having a bad
month with work.  Some personal issues have come to light at the end of
this week and earlier today, and I just don't feel like messing with the
car.  Actually I think the issues are going to cause me to have to sell
the car next week.  I haven't finalized my decision to do that yet, but
it's probably going to be what I need to do.  Anyway, I'm not in much of
a mood to work on it or really to even call and talk to anyone.  So I
don't want you hanging around waiting for me to call all weekend.  I'm
just a little stressed out right now and don't need to add to it with
the car.  Plus if I'm going to sell it, I'll just put the stock chips
back in it, and tell the next guy it needs an $82.00 oil trap to get max
boost out of it.

I get way to attached to my cars.  Especially this one, it's so rare and
in such great shap, I'll never be able to replace it again.  I see in
hemmings motor news there are 2 88 turbo S for $18,500 and $19,000... no
way i'd pay that much for one, so unless I luck into one again, I'll be
out of luck.  Oh well, I guess it's just a car! (I'll repeat that in my
sleep ad see if it helps) haha.

I'll drop you an e-mail next week and let you know what I do.

Thanks for everything so far!
Gary
