HELLO,

          I have a cracked exhaust manifold  (cyl. 2&3) on my 87 924S
    which I have read is common on 924S/944.  I was wondering if the
    flange could be welded back on as this is the only part that broke.
    I would like to know if anyone has done this and if it has worked
    for them.  Is it a special metal, do you need special welding
    equipment?  Also has anyone used the Bursch Headers ($200.00
    in some catalogues) or other headers?  Do they work, is the quality
    good or will they rust out in 24 months?  Is buying a used manifold wise
    or will they have stressed welds from heat expansion/contraction
    that will soon crack also. My Houston dealer is asking $418 + tax
    for a new one.  At that price it must Surely be made of some exotic
    German metal that we have never herd of.
    Any comments in the forum or direct E-mail will be appreciated.

                                                     THANKS
