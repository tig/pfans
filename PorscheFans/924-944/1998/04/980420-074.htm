It should come on period if it does not you are shortening the life of
your turbo. Check it directly 
by disconnecting the wires and jumping it with a hot it should come on,
if not check the relay(G19 on a 86). If these things do not help replace
it, your turbo needs this part. I replaced mine($100) along with all the
hoses leading to it. It took the better part of a saturday but was well
worth it.
