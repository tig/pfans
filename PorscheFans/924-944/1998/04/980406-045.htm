     My 88 924S started the
faint-dragging-chain-while-coasting-down-at-2000/2500rpm-sound after
replacing the stock rubber centered clutch with ZIM's spring hub clutch.  I
am guessing it is a gear resonance the factory thought would be
objectionable, hence the rubber clutch.  (Redline 75W/90NS before and
after.)  The sound hasn't become worse in 10000 miles.  I have incorporated
it into the melody of hisses, urrrrs, ticks, whistles, snarls, etc. that
tell me what is happening without looking away from the road.
