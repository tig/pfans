are made by "Gates" for Porsche.

>>question is simple, is this something that I could do?  I do not have "=

>I was helped by a friend who ended up doing most (all) of the work since
he has done several belt jobs.   YOU MUST USE THE TOOL! imho.  
>>
>>Anyone have any helpful tips on doing these jobs?  Anything in the arch=
>>ives?
>>How long, and how much frustration am I looking at to do the belts and =
>>seals?
>
>My greatest frustration was with removal of the crank bolt - because I
also did my water pump at the same time. You will NOT need to do this if
you keep the old one.
>Second real problem was removal of the allen bolt on the rotor - it
reinstated the full use of my X rated vocabulary. Also had a problem with
the triple square bolt on the cam. 
>
>I spent the better part of the week-end. But I wanted to make absolutely
sure that nothing was amiss.
>
>>Where is a good place to purchase belts and front seal kit?
>
>I found the dealer prices to be very competitive and I did not have to
wait for mail order parts. The seal kit was purchased from elsewhere before
the job. (I think Vertex, Whaletail or Zims)  You will also need the Crank
seal and metal seal guides/sleeves if they are scored.
