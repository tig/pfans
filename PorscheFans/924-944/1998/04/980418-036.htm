This question is for anyone who has done a head swap and had to re-time =
cams on a 16-valve head. I don't know if the 8-valve heads have the same =
slop in the key/keyway arrangement. I am in the process of doing a head =
swap on my 1988 944S and I have hit a snag when re-mounting the cam =
drive gear on the exhaust gear.
The engine is 90% done. I have however run into one situation that my =
Porsche factory manuals seem to overlook. Either that or I am making the =
problem too hard. The head is on, cams are in, tensioner in, entire =
exhaust and intake sides complete.

I am bolting the cam drive gear into the exhaust cam and I notice that =
the keyway/slot in the cam gear's center hole is about twice as wide as =
the key that is sticking out of the cam end. When I put the cam gear on =
the end of the cam, I have a few degrees of slop where I can twist the =
cam gear and not move the cams because of this difference in key/keyway. =
What I was going to try is to position the cam gear on the cam such that =
the three rotor bolts (used to hold it in place while tightening the =
center large bolt)line up with the marks that were left on the cam gear =
before I took it apart. Is there something I am missing? Is there an =
easier way?=20

Is there another way to accurately time the cams to the cam drive =
gear/timing belt system? My timing marks on the cam drive gear and the =
flywheel line up perfectly.

Any info would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

Jason Maynard
