To be clear, Tim, no flames intended here.

That is not quite accurate.  If all you want is top end power for a wide
open track, sure, anyone can probably have the exhaust wide open. 
However, if drivability is desired, that is a different story, one cannot
take out the exhaust and expect immediate power throughout the rpm range.
All the things like MAF, chips, etc are part of the equation.  In
addition, no cat is better than a cat that is plugged up, the comparison
has to be made between a good cat and no cat.

For the specific car, the 944 engine uses exhaust backpressure to achieve
an EGR effect, plus a wide open exhaust will mess up the 02 readings that
the DME takes into account.  I cannot locate the relevant posts right now,
but they do exist in the archives, posted by David Jalai and Jim Pasha. 
You _do_ need backpressure, even on the 951. 

It is possible that there is a communication problem.  However, IMHO, the
statement quoted is misleading.
