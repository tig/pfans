Neither.   This might help when bleeding the clutch hydraulic system, though.

Usually between the first hash mark and the middle.  Mine sits on the
first hash mark.. and the fans come on low speed when the needle reaches
the middle or slightly above, high speed just before the upper hash mark
if I'm sitting in traffic on a hot day (90-100 degrees F).

Depending on the year (can't remember) one, then two fans come on as the 
temp increases, or both start at low speed, then switch to high speed (my 
'89 does this).  A/C starts fans at low speed.

If your needle is in the red and both fans aren't on, you will need to 
check the thermoswich screwed in to the radiator, the fan relay, or the 
fan motor itself.

Sounds like you need to bleed the system again.  It takes a few tries to
get all the air worked out of the nooks and crannies in the head.  The
best way to do it is cold, with a cooling system pressure tester attached
to the mouth of the coolant reservoir, using its hand pump to gently
pressurise the system, then loosen the bleed nipple until you get coolant.

You _must_ read the 944 FAQ.  The timing belt is the source of a very
expensive failure if neglected.  If you don't have documentation on when
this was last replaced or tensioned, replace it right away!  Also, pick up
a copy of the Haynes 944 repair manual, $15, widely available.  While 
incomplete,
and occasionally criticized here, it contains useful information.  Just
don't depend on it for all repairs.  The factory manual is best.  On 
microfiche, $30, or printed for between $200-300.
