Hi Wes,
Before you spring for a new switch, I would take the seat out of the car
and check the following:
-connections to the seat connector from the floor (wiring) There are
several connectors, one each for seatbelt alarm, seat adjustment motors and
heated seats if so optioned. The connectors have plastic catches and are a
bit of a pain to undo while you are trapped under the loosened seats.
-the spade lug connectors to the two motors.  These can work loose or even
break interupting power to the switches.
-the fuse, I believe it is #6 from memory, but I may be wrong. Sometimes
wiggling the fuse will send power back into the system if the fuse contacts
have oxidized.

The switches have no slack in the wiring and appear to be very hard to
remove. I didn't have to take mine out since I found the problem in the
connectors. 

BTW the seat comes out easily with the removal of the four allen head bolts
on the rail ends (6mm I think) The seat is however heavy and unwieldy and
can easily scratch the interior finishes if the rails scrape against
leather/vinyl.
Hope this helps.
