PORSCHE in the UK have an ongoing campaign to stop organisations and
business's using their name. PORSCHE have in fact got a copyright in the
UK
on the actual word itself.

I am sure everyone understands and supports the marque in their crusade
to
stop non franchised bodies using their name. Somewhat harder to
understand
however is the fact that they are also threatening bodies of enthusiasts
with court action. Ordering them to cease any mention of the name in any
form in their titles.

Any comments or advice before blood is spilt would be appreciated?

The Porsche name in the US has been "protected" for many decades. You
cannot use the word "PORSCHE" in your corporate name without having the
lawyers down your throat. However, there is the Porsche Club of America
and the Porsche Owners Club and as you mention this list - PorscheFans -
all no problem whatsoever. These clubs have the full support of PCNA
(Porsche Cars North America).

So I'd either say your relationship with Porsche is not all it should be
for one reason or another if they don't want your club to use their name
for some reason... 

I'd call them and ask how the problem can be alleviated.
