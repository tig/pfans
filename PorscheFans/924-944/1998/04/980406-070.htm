<< Last week, I was ordering some parts from Europroducts
 (http://www.porsche-911.com/html/94485-88.htm) and when I asked the sales
 guy what specials do you have right now, he said that they have their brand
 of DME chips on sale for $129. (the Autothority was more than double that).
 It had the same 30 day guarantee, so I said what the hell. I stuck the chip
 in last night.
 
 Wow!
 
 From 2500-5000 rpm, the throttle response is much improved, and at 5000 the
 power comes on and you really notice the difference. (for those who own
 944S's you know about the 16-valve "turbo-like" lag) There was an almost
 instant difference in the performance of the car. Much more than I expected.
 Europroducts claims a 14 horsepower gain. I thoroughly believe it.
 
 I must say that this was the best $129 bucks I have spent on my car. I can
 highly recommend this chip to anyone who is wondering if the dollar-per-hp
 on a non-turbo car is worth it.

I had a Europroducts chip in my 85.5 and it provided a modest but measurable
enhancement.  One difference between that chip and the APE chips is that it
was not EPA approved (it was marked "off-road use only").  I suspect there's a
little more power to be had, and less development expense,  if the chip burner
isn't getting the chip certified.  That may also be the case with the
Europroducts chip you bought.
