Hi,

Well, I got my car back today from the bodyshop after having them install
the 968 door handles and paint and install the aero mirrors.  What can I
say?

IT'S GORGEOUS!

I really love the look and the view from the inside is great too.  Very
different.

The cost of these upgrades didn't come cheap however.  I paid $75 per =
mirror
for paint and 2.5 hrs labor each to install (they're a bit of a pain).  =
The
door handle install was 1.5 hrs each.  When you add in the cost of the
mirrors and handles the total came to about $900.  Hmmm, I think I could
have done my suspension for that... oh well, I'm happy.  The main reason =
I
chose to doe it now was I had the car in the shop for some other minor =
paint
work and decided to just do it all at once.  I'm glad I did as the car =
has a
very modern look to it... kinda like... uh, a 968 :-)
