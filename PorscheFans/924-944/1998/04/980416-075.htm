Message text written by Mark Leeber
>Could this be a case of not using anti-seize during original/last
assembly?  There was a thread awhile back about torque settings and using=

anti-seize.  I think the outcome was that 80lbs of torque was more than
80lbs when using an anti-seize compound.  I have never taken the head off=

of mine but need to soon and would be interested on the ruling of
anti-seize on head studs.

Mark,

The head studs come Locktited in with the gonzo stuff from the factory. =

Don't consider using anti-sieze on the block end of the head studs.  The
alloy head studs actually stretch to a degree which lets the engine
designers use smaller diameter studs to produce a given torque.  The
stretched elastic stud is like a rubber band, it pulls to return to its
original state.  When torquing the head, you want the stud threads in the=

soft aluminum block anchored not turning.  This leaves the friction for t=
he
stronger steel nuts and studs.   Save the anti sieze for your lug nuts.
