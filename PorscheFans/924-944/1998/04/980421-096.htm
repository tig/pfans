Hi Pfans,

Gary Handley wrote about the taper of blind hole taps. Gary you must
have looked at just part of a hand tap 'set'. A true set of hand taps
consists of 3 taps, a taper tap to get started, a 2nd tap with less
taper, and a 'plug' tap with almost no taper. Use of all three in order
will result in a fully taped hole.

It is however almost certain that Porsche did not use hand taps during
the manufacture of the engine block but machine taps which, since they
are guided by the taping machine do not need a taper tap to get started.
They will have made a fully taped blind hole in the first place.

Finally driving a bolt or stud in a tapped hole that used just the taper
tap will result in extreme bursting pressure around the end of the stud
(like driving a wedge into a something). This will result in cracks in
the block around the stud, something else these very careful German
engineers will have avoided.
