Dale,

I've always turned the spindle nut down until slightly tight (~5 ft/lbs), 
turned the hub to assure smooth bearing operation under the load and then 
loosened the nut approximately one flat (1/6th turn) until the cotter pin 
can be inserted.  After running in a set of new bearings for a week or so, 
I'll go back and reset the nut.  It seems that sometimes the bearing races
will settle some and the nut would need to be tightened an extra flat.

This has worked for me on a variety of cars over the last 20 years.  If any
professionals out there know a better way, I'd love to hear about it.  The
front bearings on my 931 seem a bit loose using this proceedure.  I can feel
some play in the wheel when grabing the top and bottom and rocking it.  
Leaving the nut slightly tight eliminates much of this play, but I'm affraid
I might overload the bearings this way.
