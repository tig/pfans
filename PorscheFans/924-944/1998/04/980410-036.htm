No offense taken. Just had to make the point that some folks actually use
SUVs.  Having lived in south Florida for a couple of years, I know it's
pretty much roads and water -- and no snow.  Not much need for SUVs.  BTW,
I once got some driving instructions from police instructor who sold
Cherokees on the side.  He really made that Cherokee fly thru the corners. 
But I agree w/ you that most SUVs are pretty poor handlers - scary, in
fact.  Happy Easter. Stop those drugs and save the Cuba ballplayers.
