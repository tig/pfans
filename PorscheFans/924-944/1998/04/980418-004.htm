I have always had a few problems selecting the correct gear in my 
968.

I have been told that the 6 speed selector means that the gears have 
to be so close together this can often cause these problems.  However 
recently this has bee getting uch worse.  The gears very often are 
not in the same place twice.  Selecting 5 and 6 seems to require an 
inordinate amount of strength and means you have to maintain a hefty 
pressure to the right whilst trying to find 5th from 4th.  Then 
getting to 6th can mean the same wrestle sometimes accidentlally 
selecting 4th again!

Reverse requires equal force in the other direction, but sometimes I 
manage to select this instead of 1st.  (very embarrassing in traffic 
ques!, not to say somewhat disconcerting!).  The problems don't seem 
to have any pattern, but when the car is cold its a ot worse.

I need to send it for a service soon so I will try to get it sorted 
then, I just wondered if any other 968 owners have had similar probs. 
 I was guessing that perhap the selector linkages are loose and not 
fiding the right path every time.  I hope its nothing more 
serious(read expensive) than that!

As usual, any input welcomed.
