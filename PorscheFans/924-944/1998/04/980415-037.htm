     This could be many things so check the easiest first.  Wait til dark, 
     turn out the lights in your garage and start the motor.  If your plug 
     wires are bad, you should see some sparks dancing on the wires.  This 
     doesn't guarentee anything but i found my problem this way and all i 
     needed to do was open my hood!

     Pfans:
     
     Would appreciate any feedback re my 86 944 and a recent problem that's
     developed.  Have had car stall  when moving from stop position.  When
     driving seems to want to cut out.  I get the impression it may be a
     problem with fuel getting to injector or some other fuel related 
     issue. 
     Have had this P for a little over a year and never experienced the
     problem before.  Problem started just before I put vehicle in garage 
     for
     winter.  It is not a turbo.
     
     When I bought vehicle had 137k miles on it.  Now has 150k.  I had the
     mechanic that has been servicing vehicle for last 10 years tell me 
     last
     year the car has a good 100k of life left.  I expect with some TLC and
     without having to sell my first born I can keep this baby running for
     some time to come.  Any suggestions appreciated.
     
     Thanks Much,
