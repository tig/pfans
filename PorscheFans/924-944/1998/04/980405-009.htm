 IT CAN STILL BE THE THROTTLE CABLE CHRIS EVEN IF THE TURBO PRODUCES 1.2
BAR.my car produced 2 bar at full throttle in first gear,but 2nd through
5th would not produce anything.this was because the throttle cable was
kinked!!!!!!!it seems to get worse as the car warms up consequently.i
just did this to my car and now it is running perfect!!!!
