Hi P-fans
	I had my 944 Turbo dyno'd this weekend. There is a place here (MT
Engineering) that has a dyno-jet dyno on a flat bed trailer. I had my car
dyno'd by MT this last SAturday! Any way, my car has APE stage II chips, with
the small boost banjo bolt (1.85" I think?) and a test pipe. On a cold (sub
40' F day) my car runs 19psi (on a 70'F day like the dyno day I have 17 psi!!)
of boost pressure. I run Sunnoco 94 octane premium pump gas. I had instructed
MT to only rev up to 6K rpms since my car has 165K miles and I really do not
rev it up past that in normal driving!! My car made 237.7 Hp and 270.6 ft/lbs
at the rear wheels. So if you use the 18% drivetrain loss calc figue that
comes out to 280.4 Hp and 319.3 ft/lbs!!  One thing about MT, they do not use
any external fans to cool the radiator (unlike most dyno set-ups!) so I would
bet the figures could be slightly better(maybe +5 hp?). My engine ping'd only
three times real close to redline. It was very light detonation, most people
did not even hear it!! kind of went, ping---, ping/ping, about a sec between
first and second pings. No blown headgasket though!!!



PS: MT was also over at University of Md last Saturday (last weekend), could
the guy/P-Fan with the 944 Turbo & Cyntex chips, that had his car dyno'd
please e-mail me!! I would like to talk to you....
