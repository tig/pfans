> I figured I would just
replace the half shafts. I found a great price on the parts $150 each w/
new
cv's. Since it is not exactly a difficult job a friend and I completed th=
e
task. We got everything back together and it the noise was gone. Then aft=
er
about 10 miles, a horribly loud knocking began to erupt from the rear end=

(differential area) =

My question is, what could replacing half shafts do to the transmission o=
r
differential? The noise is so loud you can feel it, but sometimes it is
there,
sometimes it is gone. Needless to say the car was flat bedded home where =
it
currently sits.<

Sounds like one of the rebuilt half shafts went south.  When they rebuild=

them, they grind the races oversize and install oversize balls.  BTW, if
the inner and outer race are not lined up correctly, the CV will bind.
