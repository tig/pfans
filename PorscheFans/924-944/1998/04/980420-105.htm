>I guess we can just agree to disagree.<

I love it when one of my simplistic remarks starts something.  =


Unless I am missing something, Gary is arguing the merits of anti-sieze a=
nd
Clark is arguing not to use it on the block end of the head studs.  Well
guys, I agree with both of you.  Two different subjects but good arguemen=
ts
from both sides.  And we wonder how wars start.

After a visit with Mr. Wizard, my engine builder, I think I can make a
point about why head bolts tend to strip the threads out of aluminum bloc=
k
engines (can you spell Cadillac Northstar).  The pull or force (notice I
didn't say friction) on the aluminum threads as the head bolt is torqued
down is greater than the force on the aluminum threads of the stationary
head stud when the nut is tightened to equal torque.  The threads are
inclined planes moving against each other.  There must be a mechnical
engineer lurking out there somewhere that can explain why the threads are=

more prone to stripping when head bolts are used in aluminum blocks. =

Archimedes where are you when I need you?
