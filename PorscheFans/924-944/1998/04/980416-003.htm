Thanks to the 20+ of you who responded to my brake and oil questions. It's
obviously an area that many of you have given a lot of thought to.

The consensus was that the pulsation of the brakes was most likely the ABS.
One suggestion was to pull the ABS fuse and see if that eliminated the
pulsation. I think that's a great idea if pulling the fuse causes no other
problems. Can anyone here comment on that?

Changed the brake fluid and bled the brakes and inspected the brakes
carefully. The rotors and pads have tons of material left on them and it was
fun to see what an awesome set of brakes this car has.

The consensus was also to go synthetic and like a good boy I have done that.
Put in Mobil 1 at 4.99 a quart. Anybody got any good suggestion for where to
buy this oil less expensively.

Thanks again to all.

David Greenberg
