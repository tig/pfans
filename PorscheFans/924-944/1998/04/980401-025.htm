> Hi Pfans,  After reading this list for a few months, I`ve found it hard
> to avoid the dreaded "Turbo Envy". Especially after reading about some
> of the spectacular Dyno figures that have been claimed.  I went so far
> as to go out and do a little shopping around for a 951, but I found that
> I really prefer the way the 944 feels in city driving. This is usually
> what I`m doing. However, the desire for just a little more oomph is ever
> present. Anyway over the past couple of months, a friend and I have been
> working on a little horsepower project and this is what we came up with.
> We purchased a good quality 12V cordless leaf blower, disassembled it,
> and plumbed the ducted fan assembly very discreetly right between the
> airflow meter and the throttle body. My friend is an electronics nut and
> after some experimentation, we settled on driving the fan with a pulse
> width modulated speed control that responds proportionally to engine
> RPM. In effect supercharging the intake without any belts or pulleys or
> sacrificial loss at the crankshaft. We estimate about a 50 horsepower
> gain with no lag whatsoever. The best part is you really can`t see it
> and the Tech inspectors will never know it`s there.    Have a good
> April,  Dave C.
