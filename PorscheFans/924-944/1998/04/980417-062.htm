Scott:

Hello Pfans, recently I expounded on my new found =
problems with my 951 only after purchasing the thing. Well anyhow, this
=
week it is the water pump. The quote I got from my tech was 130.00 for =
the pump

The price for the pump is high...however...this is for a REBUILT...
my point being that the R & R for the pump is right...if the rebuilt
takes a dive 12 months from now (and rebuilt pumps can) your right back
....well you know the rest.

A rebuilt can be had for $100...a new for $300.

 and 7-9hours labour to get the whole thing together. Total =
$$500+ just for replacing the pump. Does this sound right and do I have
=
alternatives? 

I don't know how adept you are @ repair on THESE "cars"...but it will
involve some knowledge.  I would be happy to help more if you should
decide to procede.

Basically, if you end up having the shop do it...the quote is consistant
and you might consider a new pump if you intend to keep the car for any
length of time.

HTH's

Ralph
