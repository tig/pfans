I too had this problem.  Fix was easy on my '86.  I had the updated
crossover pipe installed long ago, when the dealer installed the updated
4->2 header with accordion bellows; this makes it simple to unbolt the 90
degree feed stub going from the crossover into the wastegate underneath the
car.

The wastegate coupling is sealed with a ~US$20 graphite ring.  After time &
vibration, this crush-style gasket opens up a bit.  Just buy another and
slap it in there good and tight.  BTW, the factory torque spec for the bolts
on the triangle flange are ridiculously low - there's so much friction that
I didn't even have a basic seal when the torque setting was reached.  I
ended up just cranking the thing very, very tight.  You don't need to
overtighten this since the graphite will just keep compressing &
compressing.  You'll know if it leaks after you start the car - you can feel
& hear exhaust puffs from the coupling.

I wouldn't recommend cutting the seal for installation - do it right and
remove the pipes & other hardware necessary to slip it on.

Hi Tony,

I had that problem.

There should be a gasket ring at the joint.  The problem is that to fit 
 it involves parting the joint which is not at all easy as much 
 dismantling of the exhaust is required.

The gasket is a ring made of some sort of soft metal compound and when 
 you tighten up the bolts on the triangular flanges the gasket 
 "squashes" to give a gas-tight seal.

As the gasket is soft I found that it could be cut, I used tin snips, 
 in one place and then carefully opened it up enough to get it around 
 the pipe thus avoiding the need to separate the pipe.  I did this 2 
 years ago and it has been fine ever since.  Even if the gasket breaks 
 in the bending process it will probably still work okay as the 
 material kind of welds together under pressure as the flange bolts are 
 re-tightened.  Cost of the gasket was approx 3 pounds from the dealer.

Regards.....John.

Inverness, Scotland.
