greetings,

after not driving my 951 for about 2 weeks (i've been outta town....) i came
back to find the battery dead. or at least that's what's going on at first
blush.  it won't turn over at all. voltage reads under 10V (per dash gauge).
the alarm (alpine) was on for the entire time, but can this have pulled that
much power??

NOTE! this same lack of turn-over problem has also happend before, i didn't
notice the voltage gauge at the time, but was told by the previous owner
(sorry, ben) to tap the fuse/relay box under the hood. it started right up.  

i think i'm gonna open up the fuse box and clean everything out with some blue
shower - that should cure the 'tap the box' problem, but wonder about the
inability to start the car after i've been outta town for some time. i travel
extensively for work and this could be a real pain. 

ideas....suggestions.......

thanks bunches
