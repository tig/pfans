Check to make sure that your front crankshaft bolt is tightened to the right
torque.
A loose bolt will not allow the oil pump to turn for the first few seconds
of startup...

Good Luck!

> Hi P-fans,
>
> I really need the collective wisdom of this list now.
>
> Yesterday evening I started my car and had no oil pressure for
> around 3 seconds, all lights in the dashboard were on.
>
> The sound of the motor was normal. I just decided to shut it
> down, then suddenly the oil pressure was there and the lights
> went out.
>
> I drove home carefully and listened for unusual sounds but
> everything was perfect.
>
> This morning I started the car, no pressure, all lights on,
> and after 3 seconds the lifters were starting to make horrible
> sounds, so there was really no pressure. I shut the engine
> down, tried again, no pressure at all.
>
> Oil level is ok, just under the top mark. The oil filter was
> changed with the oil around 3000 miles ago.
>
> Where do I have to search for the problem?
>
> The car is a 86 944 NA, not modified in any way.
>
> As always, thanks in advance
