1986 Turbo, which I just purchased which appears to be in excellent
condition. The girl who owned it is the original owner. The car has 100K
miles, with a stack of receipts for all the normal maintenance.  She
installed new Dunlap D40-M2 tires on the rear (225-50ZR 16).  When I test
drove the car, the rear felt very loose (the rear of the car wants go either
left or right when I try to drive straight) at highway speeds and doesn't
feel safe at 80 or 90 mph.  I checked the tire pressure and pumped the rear
tire pressure up from 20psi to 40 psi, and no difference.  I took the car to
a mechanic to fix a leaking wastgate flange and checked out as much as I
could see.  No bent or broken swaybar brackets or links (front or rear). The
shocks feel great. No bouncing, very tight up and down.  It just feels like
the back end sways back and forth ever so slightly.  I feel that if I had to
swerve to avoid something, I would loose it.  Does the rear suspension have
toe in or toe out adjustments?  What could it be?  I remember when I owned a
83 911SC, I had put new rear tires on and the back felt loose, but not like
this.  I'm afraid to drive the car over 70 and I used to race SCCA (Datsun
510's).  When you drive over a uneven pavement at speed the front of the car
is fine, it's just the back .  Something is definitely wrong.
Help.
