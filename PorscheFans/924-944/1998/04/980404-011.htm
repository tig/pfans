Six listmembers have emailed asking me if the reset procedure works on
an S2 so here goes. I followed Dieter Schulze's post (4.4.98 digest,
dieter.schulze@wmeng.com) and Mike's post (3.31.98 digest,
mahler9th@aol.com).

1. Found the white 3-pin connector. It is almost at the firewall, barely
visible. The 19-pin connector I had asked about earlieris the DME
diagnostic plug. Once you see the orange air-bag control unit below the
glove-box, follow the harness and you will find the white test plug. I
had to remove the floor-mat, carpet and the wooden DME cover before I
could reach it.
2. Took a 5-ft length of speaker wire and stuck one end into the middle
pin of the test plug.
3. Took the ash-tray out to use the ground wire to the bulb in the
ash-tray.
4. Used a metronome set to 60bps to time the 5-second sequences:
	* With the speaker wire grounded at the ash-tray, ignition on
	* Five seconds
	* Ungrounded the speaker wire
	* Five seconds
	* Grounded the speaker wire
	* Five seconds
	* Ungrounded the speaker wire
	* Five seconds
	* Ignition off

Maybe I was lucky, I did not use a digital stopwatch, and the metronome
could hardly have been very accurate. I also did not rig a switch, just
touched the speaker wire coming from the 2nd pin to the ash-tray ground
when I needed to. Worked the first time, air-bag and seatbelt warning
lights now go away a few seconds after ignition, and the huge
exclamation point disappears. The seatbelt chime also works correctly
now.

Dieter's advice is worth remembering -- if this procedure does not work
you should take the car to a dealer. An air-bag system has just too many
components that could go wrong -- the 4 sensors, the gas detonator, the
control unit, the harness, the air-bags, the warning light, the
self-test -- I would not mess with anything other than the test plug.
