Yeah, there is a toe adjustment in the rear. Have that checked. But there are
some other things that could be causing toe to change while you drive and both
of them will cause the scary feel. One is worn rear stub axle bearings and the
other are really worn bushings where the spring plate and the control arm mate
to the torsion tube. Maybe also where the arm mates to the torsion tube towards
the middle of the tube.

A decent alignment place should be able to figure this out for you.
