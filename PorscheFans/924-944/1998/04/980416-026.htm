"Stock" may be the issue...perhaps...I'm running the new double
adjustable
Koni's...the eccentric bolt on the strut...of course...is where the
camber
adjustment is made.  Now it seems to me (I may plead ignorance later!)
that
the dimensions of the stock bolt were different.  I'm currently running 
2.65 negative...with more adjustment left!

There are "a couple" of theories...for street driving I AGREE
100%...Alan
Johnson addresses this in one of his books...there IS a measure of trade
off
dependant of the track's lay-out.  Fortunately...toe is probably one of
the
easier adjustments made relative to course conditionds.

Undoubtedly, any one driving their car on a daily "street" basis would
be 
better served sticking w/ factory settings.
