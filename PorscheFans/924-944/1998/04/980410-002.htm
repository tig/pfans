86  951, car runs great, stack of normal maint receipts.  I came from a 928
so bear with me.  The boost gauge goes consistently to what appears to be
1/2 way between the 1.6 & 1.8 bar mark under wot in every gear.  I'll call
it 1.7     I have never seen it go higher. Everything seems to be in working
order. New cat, no exhaust leaks, good hoses and very smooth idle. Is this
normal? and if so how much boost is this?  Correct me if I'm wrong, but
isn't atmospheric pressure at sea level 14.7 psi?  If that is correct, would
the 1 bar mark be 0 boost?  If I multiply .7 x 14.7=10.29 psi boost. Seems
low compared to what other people talk about. I'm basically trying to figure
out the condition of the car, before I chip it.  Leak down test prior to
purchase is fine. Turbo spools up quick and smooth. Car runs good. I just
want to make sure the basics are fine before I go mess it up :-)  Thought
about aftermarket boost gauge etc....but kinka didn't want the hassle.
