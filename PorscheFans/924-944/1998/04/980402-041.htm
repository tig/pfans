This would be nightmarish, and probably not worth the time, unless you
have lots of it.  You would need to get the part numbers of all the
components and compare to make sure they are identical between both cars. 
A basic list might include the master cylinder, ABS control unit, ABS
servo, brake lines, all new calipers that incorporate the the ABS sensors,
all new rotors that have the ABS 'teeth' that the sensors read.  I don't
even want to think about the electrical wiring.  You will definitely want 
to look at an ABS equipped 944 to see how things are mounted/routed.

If they are intermittent when operated by the outside lock cylinders, and
not the central locking switch on the console, the little microswitch
mounted on top of the lock cylinder has worn, and will need to be
replaced.  This will involve taking off the inner door panel, and
replacing the switch.  It will make sense once you get in there, but plan
on setting aside an afternoon, as there are a few linkages to the lock
cylinder you will have to fuss with. 

Also, when you have the door panels off, check the electrical connections 
to the door lock servo.. they may have become loose or corroded.
