Well, I didn't receive many answers on my first post, so I figured I'll try
posing my problems one by one :-)

By far the biggest problem (at least so it seams) with my new 951 is that it
cuts the fuel VERY abruptly during heavy acceleration. It is almost like
someone is hitting the brakes! It usually happens around 4000rpm but will
not occur if I just accelerat "normally". Also, my boost gauge is stuck at
one when the engine is on (it returns to 0 when engine is turned off). I
believe I can hear the turbo spinning during the acceleration so somehow the
boost gauge must be connected wrong?

Any ides what could be causing this mess? When I accelerate close to the
limit possibe without the engine cutting out the turbo definitely pulls
strong.

Any advise / suggestions will be appreciated.

Happy Motoring!

Thanks,
