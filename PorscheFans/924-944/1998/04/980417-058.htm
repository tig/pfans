Before taking the belt off, perhaps the list would like to hear about an
interesting test we did on the Talon.  Remember that the 944 uses the EXACT
same system as the Talon and in fact Porsche licensed the configuration from
Mitsubishi (the makers of the Talon) for US$8 per car.  When David Buschur,
guru of 4-cylinder drag motors (640hp out of a 2.0L motor, no nitrous)
removed his balance shaft assembly, everyone out there copied him.  On his
motor, turning at 8500rpm, it was found that 14hp was being lost to the
balance shaft assembly.  To make it work, he balanced the entire engine.
What happened though was very interesting.  The people who copied him w/o
balancing the motor found that things like oil lines would crack, bolts would
come loose, unusual stuff that never happened before.  Even though the car
felt OK, a little more vibration than stock, bizarre stuff started
coming loose and falling off.  We all feel that the high frequency vibrations
that are soaked up by the engine mounts were causing the parts to loosen
and fall off.

So, if you are going to take the belts, assembly, etc. off, take the time to
also balance the motor and keep an eye on oil or any other hard lines, 
especially if the car is used at high rpm for prolonged periods of time.
You may not feel the high frequency vibrations, but your oil lines 
and eventually your pocket book sure will!
