so eloquently stated:

>Anybody have any recommendations on where to get a control arm?

This is not a recommendation, just what I have seen advertised in Pano =
and
Excellence.  Fast Tech Motorsports claims to have what they call "Club
Sport" control arms for $825 each.  This is not exactly a great price, =
but
if they have the hardware it might be worth a call.  However, for that =
price
you can get the Fabcars from OG Racing.... or see below.

>Has anyone had any luck having their ball joints rebuilt?

If you want a really slick setup you could get the ball joints rebuilt =
and
have Kelly-Moss do one of their spherical bushing replacement jobs on the
bushings.  This isn't exactly cheap (about $825/pair), but several list
members have had this done with tremendous improvements in handling.
