Well, it seems my "simple task" of upgrading to the 968 body-colored door
handles on my S2 has become more than I wish to handle, so to speak.
Therefore I'm letting the bodyshop owner do the install as long as my car=
 is
there getting the aero mirrors painted, etc.

=46or those contemplating this task you should be aware that in order to
change a door handle on a late model 944 you have to:

-- remove door panels
-- remove plastic water barrier
-- remove power door lock actuator mechanism
-- remove window
-- remove window guide rail

Only after you have done all this can you get your hot little hands on =
the
door latch linkage (or even see it).  The first three I did myself before
dropping off the car, but I didn't feel confident tackling the window.

The 968 handles themselves are a drop-in perfect replacement and will be =
a
great cosmetic improvement in my opinion.  It's the install that's a =
PITA.
