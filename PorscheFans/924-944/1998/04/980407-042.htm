Hi P-fans
	I just got a new catalog from Robert Bently books today. I noticed that the
"imfumous" Corky Bell, has written a book on turbocharged cars. How they work
and how to improve the designs. I was wondering if anyone has seen or read
this book? I think this is the same "Corky Bell" who used to run "Car-Tech" a
turbo shop in Texas that "made" turbo kits (a turbo Miata sticks out in my
mind) for the Jap/rice rocket cars. I have also heard a lot of seedy things
about the way he ran his shop, so I am kind of skeptical about any book he
would write. Anyone have a comments?

BTW the Robert Bently catalog is free to anyone who would like one. E-mail
them at:  sales@rb.com 
I have no connection to them. They have workshop books for: VW, Audi, Jag,
BMW, Volvo,Ford, Jeep, MG, Triumph, and Toyota.
