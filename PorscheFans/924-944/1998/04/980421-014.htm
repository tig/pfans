Henrik,

It seems your boost gage is not working, and I don't know how to fix   
that, but someone will. :)

I have the same cutting off problem that you have, and I have received   
many tips on how to fix it.  One possibility is that the connection to   
your air flow meter needs to be cleaned.  The next is your wastegate is   
stuck.  The next is that you have a leak in your lines going to the   
wastegate so that it doesn't measure the proper boost from the turbo and   
keeps letting boost build.  Result: your DME/KLR will shut down the fuel   
so you don't blow your head gasket and you fly through the windshield.   
 Inspect your hoses to and from the wastegate and cycling valve.  Email   
me if you want more info, I have saved all the posts I got.  I am going   
to replace my hoses this weekend.
