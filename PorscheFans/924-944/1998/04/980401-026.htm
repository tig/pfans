Ah! Both cams. As usual, I jumped into a serious modification w/
insufficient research. Just woke up one nice Saturday morning and grabbed
that 944S exhaust cam I had lying around the garage, thought "Hey, let's
see what this does" and stuck it in the S2.  Hate to think of what would
have happened if it had been an intake cam.  

George B. -- have any decent intake cams on hand? I'm ready for that extra
20 hp.
