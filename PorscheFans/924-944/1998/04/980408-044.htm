Hello all,
     I am fairly new to the list and enjoy all the great insight provided
daily.  Here are are few problems I am experiencing with my 1984 944.  The
idle sometimes wants to stall then goes back up, back down, back up, (you get
the picture), could this be the O2 sensor that I've been hearing so much
about?  Also on occasion a loud clicking sound comes from what I assume is the
cruise control unit.  Has anyone experienced this problem?  Other dilemma is
my odometer does not work.  The cable is attached to the gauge.  Is there any
kind of sensor that could be bad or disconnected?  Oh, and one more thing,  my
oil pressure seems to be high under normal driving conditions, what should it
be? I realize by using the phrase "normal driving conditions", I could confuse
some of you. :)  

Thanks in advance,

Sam Chinigo
