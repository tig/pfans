Hello everyone,
  I recently had my wish granted and have a 951 in my area for sale.
Its an '86 with power everything, leather, sunroof, heated mirrors, CD
and seems to be in good shape on the outside. Owner is asking for
$6.9k and I think it has 107k mi. on it. I need advice from owner's
experience for my situation as well as any help I could get that's not
on the FAQ. I might try to test drive it today, and if it checks out
o.k., I'll try to find a local dealership (nonPorsche as there is none
here) to prepurchase inspect it. Is there anyone in the SE Washington
state area, particularly in the Tri-Cities that could tell me where to
take it for a trusted and quality mechanic?
  Please help, I'm 21 and this is the first car I'm buying, I don't
want to get into big trouble after I buy it!!
  Could you also give me estimates on average yearly costs for
maintenance/repair?

TYVMIA (thank you very much in advance),
