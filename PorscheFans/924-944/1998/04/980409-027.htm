You mean you guys didn't hear about the huge sale that GM launched
yesterday?  There's a blowout on all Pontiac Fireturds, and outrageous
rebate savings on all Camaros.  Supposedly, Ford is responding with it's
own sale on Mudstangs.  Everyone on the list sold their Porsches and
finally bought some real American iron!  Heh-heh...

Looks like the server has gone south again.  I noticed where several
messages were posted twice.  When I sent a reply this morning, I got the
confirmation twice.  Plus, a bunch of went and sold our cars last night,
judging by the fact that there are only 116 members now.

Computers--you gotta love them!!
