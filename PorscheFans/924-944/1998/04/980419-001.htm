my heater quit working in december.my mechanic said the part to fix it was about $600.at the 
time(just before christmas)i didnt have the money.the mechanic did something under the hood and 
the heater worked again.he said he switched something around so it would blow warm air,and the 
process would have to be reverced in the spring if i wanted to use the airconditioning.is their 
a 
cheeper way to properly fix this problem,can i get a used part? also i was told its illeagle to 
change my exaust system around in california.i would like to install a header pipe and run 
without 
a cat converter.is their a way to hook up a bolt on pipe that would replace the cat 
converter,and 
then when its time to get it smogged i could just bolt the cat converter back on? im just trying 
to get a few more hp on my 85.5 944
