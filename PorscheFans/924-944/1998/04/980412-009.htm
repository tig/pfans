my german mechanic,(the REEEEEEEL thing,accent and all)told me to stay away from turbo 944s.he 
says their a lot of trouble to work on and maintance is twice as much as a non-turbo 944.i almost 
considered buying a turbo modle the other day but he talked me out of it.can someone tell me how 
many miles are the engins good for and are they a pain in the rear or not? i drove one recently 
that had been chipped and was really impressed.it felt like it accelerated harder than my 
neighbors 96 z-28 camaro.whats the scoop,should i buy one or not?
