Are you winning or losing? If you're winning, then leave the stuff in
until some one posts a faster time. If you're losing, then keep
taking it out (and work on your driving).

I don't know about autocross courses, but at Bridgehampton, a 2.85
mile track, a 200 lb passenger costs me about 3 seconds / lap.

Surely, additional weight, (especially the spare tire, being located
so far from the pivot point) will slow you down. I can't give you
a definitive amount of time, but less weight = faster times.
