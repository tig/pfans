Love the analogy! I grew up in Spain, where the 2CV was a staple of
everyday life. Brings back some fond automotive memories...

Is your belt making the whining noise until about 4000 RPM (at which
time it gets drawned out in engine noise)? If so, was the noise
introduced when you had the belts changed, or when you had them
retensioned? 

I've had "THE WHINE" on my '93 968 ever since I've owned it. The dealer
tells me it's because the wider belt, blah, blah, blah, but I absolutely
_hate_ it. I'm having the timing & balance belts replaced next week, so
I'd like to know if there something I can request from the shop (Porsche
dealer) that will make this noise go away.

Any ideas?
