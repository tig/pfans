Awright........now you've forced me to ante up my .02, and I raise you
another .02!

The 928 list totally explored/debated the subject of thread torques vs
lubricants and anti-seize.  As usual, there are several experts on the
subject (no pun) in these lists (I'm not one of them - simply reporting
here).  Application (vibration, heat cycles, materials, safety, etc) may

dictate thread locker, as well as anti-seize.   The key point is that
fasteners do not depend on 'friction' to do their job:  it's tension
between the nut and bolt (against those threads) that provides the
holding power and where torque is measured.   This whole debate started
over discussion about use of anti-seize on lug nuts.   It was
established that torque specs are obtained due to stretch of the bolt
inside the nut - and not using anti-seize on that application risks
galling (and having to chisle lugs off the car).   The mechanics are the

same in all threaded applications:  tension between threads of the two
elements.
