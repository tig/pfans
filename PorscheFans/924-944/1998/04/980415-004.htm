unfortunately leaving your car for two weeks will almost certainly
flatten your battery.
Your alarm will take power as will the radio and, what I think, is the
stock alarm.
Its not much (C25mA) but due to the 'simplicity' of auto charging
systems the battery is unlikely
to be fully charged in the first place leading to fairly rapid
discharge.
Discharging your battery is bad news as the life of the battery will be
seriously reduced.
This is a very common problem worthy of inclusion in the FAQ.
I believe you can buy trickle chargers that will keep the battery
roughly in the same state of
charge that you left it (don't expect these to charge a flat battery in
less than about a year!)
Being tight I have made a simple unit that I leave connected to the
cigar lighter and it works a treat.
If you have an ammeter you can check the discharge levels but your
description sound very much like
'business as usual'.
If you need info on the home made charger or how to check for problems I
will try to help.

Regards,

Clive
