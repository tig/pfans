Menelaos,

I've been using these wheels on my '87 944 Turbo for a couple of years now
with no rubbing on the suspension components or fenders.  Appearance wise,
they transform the car!  The stock phone dials look archaic in comparison!

The 7" width of the front wheel is the same as stock, but the greater offset
(65mm vs 52.3mm) results in a narrower track up front.  I was concerned
about potential handling problems resulting from the change in geometry up
front, but I really haven't noticed any.  The steering feels a bit heavier,
but that's probably due to the wider tires up front (225/50 vs 205/55).
Visually, you'll notice the front wheels sit inside the fenders more than
you'd probably like.  I tried to find a spacer around 12.7mm, with no luck.
This would probably have to be custom made and would require longer studs so
I didn't bother going to that expense.

Apparently, there is an 8x16 wheel of the same design which you might
consider using up front.  I think it was original equipment on a certain
model year of the 928.  I don't know the part number or the offset though.

Regards,
Jim
