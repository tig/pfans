The procedure for timing a 944S engine involves a couple of dial indicators
and is completely
documented in the factory service manual... The procedure is entirely too
involved to try
to pass along the information via the internet...

A couple of years ago, I fixed a 944S engine. It took me a total of ten
iterations to get the
camshaft timing right...
Good Luck!

    Subject: Head Swap Question on 944S


    This question is for anyone who has done a head swap and had to re-time
cams on a 16-valve head. I don't know if the 8-valve heads have the same
slop in the key/keyway arrangement. I am in the process of doing a head swap
on my 1988 944S and I have hit a snag when re-mounting the cam drive gear on
the exhaust gear.
    The engine is 90% done. I have however run into one situation that my
Porsche factory manuals seem to overlook. Either that or I am making the
problem too hard. The head is on, cams are in, tensioner in, entire exhaust
and intake sides complete.

    I am bolting the cam drive gear into the exhaust cam and I notice that
the keyway/slot in the cam gear's center hole is about twice as wide as the
key that is sticking out of the cam end. When I put the cam gear on the end
of the cam, I have a few degrees of slop where I can twist the cam gear and
not move the cams because of this difference in key/keyway. What I was going
to try is to position the cam gear on the cam such that the three rotor
bolts (used to hold it in place while tightening the center large bolt)line
up with the marks that were left on the cam gear before I took it apart. Is
there something I am missing? Is there an easier way?

    Is there another way to accurately time the cams to the cam drive
gear/timing belt system? My timing marks on the cam drive gear and the
flywheel line up perfectly.

    Any info would be greatly appreciated.

    Sincerely,

    Jason Maynard
