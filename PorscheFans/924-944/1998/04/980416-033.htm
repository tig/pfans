Having Been there and done that , we will be coming back for more.

I think we should remind all PFANS that this is a great party, the food, is
great and the company is outstanding. Steve is fun to be around, and you can
always go shopping in is basement or garage and come home with some toys
(maybe we can get him loaded and really do some shopping)

	Regards,

Dan
