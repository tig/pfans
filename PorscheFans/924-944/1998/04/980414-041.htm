I flush before each DE and once a year in the cars I don't track. I have
never experienced the pulsing (I don't have ABS) but one thing I would
check is rotor wear. The wear limits are not large (2mm total on a non-S
front rotor) and I suspect that most of the cars I see at the track need
new rotors for that reason alone. If you can feel a dramatic lip at the
outside edge of the rotor where the pad doesn't sweep you are probably
feeling 1mm of wear per side.

I use synthetic and change at 4K miles or 2 DE events, whichever comes first.
