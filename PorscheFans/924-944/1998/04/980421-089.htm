Ya know,, I'm on another list made of of news photographers (my
profession) (watch out princess!) and about as deep as they get is a
discussion of how to send digital photos and which hat to wear! I
enjoy reading stuff by people who know what they are talking about,
even if I don't know enough about what they are talking about to know
if they know what they are talking about.
