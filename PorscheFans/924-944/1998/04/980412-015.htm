Thanks for the reply and your experiences...

Oddly enough, I just got a "Performance Products" catalog (kinda like a
Tweeks or Automotion) and one of the little tech blurbs reads:

(edited)

"... cranks for a long time before it fires when hot... may have a leaking
check valve in the fuel pump. A faulty check valve will allow the fuel to
flow back into the gas tank leaving air in the fuel lines. When you try to
start the car. the fuel lines need to be filled first to build enough
pressure for injection. This takes a long time when hot since the injection
system runs leaner when hot. To check the fuel pump- get someone to clamp
the rubber fuel line to stop the flow of fuel right when you turn the
engine off to stop the flow of fuel on the engine side of the fuel pump.
Wait 20 minutes, remove clamp, and try to start. If it starts right away,
it's the check valve and it's time for a new fuel pump."

FYI: their fuel pump prices (probably not the best, but good for a ballpark)

new $230
rebuilt $140

I think this may be it for my car since it will start right back up fine,
like if I run into a store or grab a lunch, but fares less well it I let it
sit for an hour or two...

It cold starts fine and the "starting system" sounds fine and feels strong
otherwise...

I'll let you know what this test reveals...

REPLY TO THE FOLLOWING from <surya.ganguly@gwl.com>:

Daniel: sounds like you've been driving my 944! I don't know the
solution to your problem but I can tell you what I have tried so you can
save some money and time.

Here are the symptoms on my '84 944:
1. Starts up fine after sitting a month, idles smooth.
2. Starts up fine every morning, idles smooth.
3. Starts and idles fine during the day if it has stopped less than an
hour.
4. Anytime it has been driven enough to get warm/hot, and sits for
between an hour and 12 hours, it starts poorly, idles rough for 5
minutes.

I have measured fuel pressure at rail and at pump and they are at spec.
Hardly any fuel leaks down so injector seals etc. are ok. Fuel pressure
at rail is marginally higher than spec at idle. Have changed cap, rotor,
wires, plugs and coil -- no effect.

So the summary is, definitely not an electrical problem. Could be the
fuel pressure regulator (does your fuel pump whine at times?), or a
dirty fuel filter. According to the dealer it could even be the winter
gas here in CO but I know the car enough to recognize this as a
consistent fuel-delivery related problem. Haven't gone all out to solve
it yet because it is just annoying, runs fine after a few minutes.

Let me know if you figure this one out or get any suggestions from
listmembers, TIA.
