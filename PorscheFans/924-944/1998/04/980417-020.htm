Basically, you want to check all the bolts back there for tightness. The
fact that you were missing a bolt which does not normally get turned during
routine maintenance would have me thinking that someone has had the torsion
tube down and did a lousy job putting it back up. Check all the bolts and
nuts associated with anything bolted to the torsion tube (thing with the
stubby ends just in front of the rear wheels) or the trailing arms. This
would include at least:

     shock lower and upper bolts
     trailing arm to spring plate bolts and eccentric
     alloy mount to torsion tube bolts
     spring plate bolt and eccentric
     alloy mount to chassis, upper and lower
     anti-roll bar to trailing arm eccentric
     anti-roll bar to torsion tube
     hard brake lines to flex lines

FYI, the bolt you were missing should have a self-locking nut on it. Make
sure this is the case on the bolt you found loose and on the one you used
as a replacement for the lost one.

In fact, I can't think of a single nut in either the front or rear
suspension that isn't a self-locking nut.  I guess anything is possible but
I don't see how one of the factory self-locking nuts could vibrate off the
bolt you lost.

Also make sure that any fastener you replace back there is the same grade
as the one the factory put on (most are either 8.8 or 10.9).

Either the Haynes manual or the factory Tech Spec booklet will have the
torque specs you need. The Tech Spec booklet however will also list the
size of the fastener and the requirement for a locking nut, single use
fastener, etc. Maybe even the grade.
