A US designation Group 41 battery will fit fine.  An Interstate battery
seems to be a good choice.  I have seen more than one posts on this list
claim they outlast Diehards by far.  I think they are also sealed, which
leads to less acid leakage than the old style w/ the accesible caps on
every cell.

Do get a battery cover, if you do not have one.  If you do not want to get
a Porsche one, grab one from an A2 or A3 Golf or Jetta (85-current 
models), the batteries seem to be of similar size.

If you feel adventurous, you can go for an Optima battery.  It is a gel
type, really difficult to get it to leak acid.  There are issues w/
fitting it, however, as it is tall and you have to lay it on its side to
fit it.  Probably worth the trouble if you have time to do your homework
before needing a new battery.
