Hello P-Fans
	A new clutch will have a "light" feel or effort compared to an old worn
clutch. That is if the clutch job was done right in replacing: the needle
bearings in the release fork, release/through out bearing, pilot bearing,
ect... When I replace my clutch the feel had a Toyota type feel. this shortly
will return to a heavy and heavyer type feel as the clutch wears. Also the
engagement position will move. When the clutch is new the clutch will enage
towards the floor, as it wears it will slowy engage higher and higher. When I
replaced my clutch, the engagement position was almost in the last inch of the
clutch pedal release. When the clutch was new it would almost engage on the
floor.
	So I mainly think the different feel is from new greased bearings and not the
pressure plate type.

Good Luck
Davidjalali

Subject: Old clutch feel

Someone mentioned that their new Cup clutch is easier to push than the old
stock clutch.  I thought one sign of an aging clutch (the whole thing, not
just the friction plate) was increased effort required to push the clutch
pedal.  Is that not right?
