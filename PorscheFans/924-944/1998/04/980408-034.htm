Hi everyone,
        My question is related to the diameter of the hose on the
wastegate. During my repair of my boost problem I had replace the
wastegate hose with a 10mm hose. After seeing a post from "Hansman"
about changing the hose diameter with a different size, I decided to
measure the orignial which turned out to be 5.6mm almost 6mm. 
Actually the ends have different sizes. Since the timing valve is
pulsed to reduce the pressure in the hose thus closing the waste gate.
Is the pulse calibrated some way to only reduce so much at a time.
This may be a question for Steve "The Most Hated Man on the Internet"
Timmins and maybe the PhD. is good for something. Some of my best
friends (and brother) have one. Anyway of course this question is open
to anyone.
Thx,
