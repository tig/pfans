I've owned an '83 for about 9 years and enjoyed it tremendously...with the
exception of a few $ervice bills for belts, water pumps and the like.  About
a month ago I got lucky and found my dream car - 1989 g.red 951 with 23,000
local (Seattle) mi. and all books, records and receipts.  It's now in the
shop for it's 30,000 mi service (6,000 mi. early) and whatever other
details/parts/fluids need to be changed or updated.  Any advice for
servicing and caring for a 9 year old supercar that has seen little use?
Should all the fluids be changed?  Are there any recall notices that I
should check out?  And if so, does anyone have the phone number at PNA to
check and see if they have been done?  Is there anything in addition to the
standard 30,000 mi. service that I should have done; even if it's somewhat
obscure, I would rather be safe than sorry......especially since I've waited
a long time to find this car.
p.s.  this list is great....everyone please just keep on contributing and
expressing themselves - there may be some rough spots, there may be some
pissing matches - but overall there is good content and a fine resource and
an extra-special human side to it all.
