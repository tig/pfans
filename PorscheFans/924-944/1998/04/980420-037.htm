Over the weekend... I finally decided to change my shift lever length and
feel... as I have always felt that Porsche made it too long.
1. Took measurements to see how much I wanted to remove
2. Removed the shift lever
3. Cut the steel shift lever 23mm with a hacksaw
4. Trimmed 15mm off the bottom of the aluminum shift knob base, and
renotched it for
        the retaining clip... so it clears and stays above the angle in the
shift lever
5.  Recontoured the lever to the original specs with the appropriate
notches for the
        neoprene dampers which fit between the lever and the shift know ...
with my
        Foredom flex shaft (you can use a Dremel... a small grinder wheel
on a drill...or
        with a lot longer work timeframe ...a set of files).
The result??  A much more pleasant shifing characteristic with a shorter
throw (note:  these mods were made with the lever on the car... not
removed.... just take care to cover well the shift lever teflon bearing
below the shift lever so that metal filing contaminants do not fall there
and hasten wear in the bearing).  Spend the time to mimic carefully the
original profile... you are recreating it lower on the lever.  (Word of
caution... your lever may measure different... so take your own
measurements)

With the shift knob now nicely lower... the hand now naturally falls onto
the shift lever... even with your elbow resting on the armrest (don't know
how this will be with others... I am 6'1" in height).  In a nutshell...
much improved ergonomics.  If you have the smaller diameter steering wheel
as I do... the sense of improved integration and balance will be very
evident.  Anyone who wishes to do this will be very pleased with the
results.  Do, however, spend the time to get the job right, so that the
neoprene dampers fit properly again and the knob seats itself well again.

If you want to go the extra step... I also cross-drilled the lever and the
knob assembly (near the base... under the leather... just above the
retaining clip)... tapped and threaded the hole in the lever... and have
mechanically secured the knob to the lever with a stainless steel 4mm hex
head 18mm length bolt.  This has given the knob a MUCH more precise feel...
and gotten rid of that "rubbery" characteristic as we have are used-to.
The knob is now mechanically coupled to the shift lever.  As I have been
involved with Ferraris for years... I am used to a much more positive shift
lever/knob "feel".... and the modifications I made have accomplished the
desired result.  The feeling of precision is very much improved... you can
now feel the gears and engagement and disengagement.  Porsche blessed us
with a linkage system... not a cable-based system... only to numb it at the
shifter.

All the numbness inherent in Porsche's design is now gone.  Big improvement.
