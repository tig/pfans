Boy do I get hacked off at these USA prices. When my Rose got totalled
by my brother. The insurance finally coughed up 13500 pounds. I+d paid
11250 for the car at a garage. Two years ago when it had 64000 miles on
the clock and since then put another 34000 miles on it. Sometime people
never seem to comprehend when they're telling you that you could have
purchased a new car for the same price. Sure and how much would I lost
in those same two years?

Mind you this is little constellation when you know it'll cost more to
replace and you are fanatical enough to jet wash the engine twice a
week, refurbish the weeks every six months, change the discs because
they have scratches, spent 500 quid Teflon coating the bodywork, powder
coat the engine undertray and inside of the ashtray to match the wheels
or get a hand made leather Fire Extinguisher holster made to match the
interior........AAAAAARRRRGGGHHHH. Still hoping to get an identical one
but with only around 35 RHD ones left it could be a LHD
