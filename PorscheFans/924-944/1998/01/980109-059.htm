You need to reseal the lamp assembly to the body.  Porsche recommends a 
VW adhesive kit, part number AKD.522.009, but there are probably 
generic "dumdum" products available in any good parts store.

<< In my case, the kit they sell provides 2 1/4 inches of adjustability.
Eibach springs in the 2 1/2 diameter come in 8 or 10 inch lengths (in 500 lb.
rate)  With 10 in. springs I'm at the bottom of the adjustment (only about
1/8" for my balancer to work with), and with the 8 inchers, I'm at the top of
my adjustment (again, only about 1/8" for my balancer to work with).  I'm
curious which springs you used, and at what height you've set up your car.

Interesting.  I've got 250# springs.  I'm not sure how long they are, didn't
even think about it.  The collar is set about 1/2 to 3/4 inch below the top.
I set the height so it's even with the rear, which should be a hair below
stock.  I think it lowered the car about 1/4 inch.  I used to have to lift
under the door to get my jack under the middle jack point.  Now I can no
longer get the jack under my mid point, so it much more of a hassle now to
jack the front up :(  Oh well.

I really like the feel of the strut mounts.  You can feel the contour of the
road more, which makes the car feel more connected.  Steering response is much
more crisp now, although it helps amplify the feeling of needing a bigger sway
bar.
