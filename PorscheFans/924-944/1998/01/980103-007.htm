  My battery in my 944 has finally died.  Despite trying a recharger, I can't
get enough current to start the engine.  Well, I started to go to different
stores to find a battery.  To my surprise, finding a battery for a 944 is very
difficult.
    Sears has all sorts of batteries for the 911 or 928 but don't carry one
for the 944.  They did say that if I brought the battery in, they would find
one of the appropriate size and put it in.  They said a 911 could probably fit
in a 944.  They said the amperage etc. would be sufficient for a 944.  Is this
correct?
    I then went to another auto parts place that sells Exide batteries.  They
didn't have one listed on their computer that would fit a 944.  
    The battery I have now is an Interstate battery.  I am not sure if it is
the right size since it barely fits in the batteyr compartment.  The owner
before me purchased it and it has been in for at least 3 years that I know.

   What batteries do you have in your 944?  Anybody else every have this
problem. I would like to get a Sears Diehard since they have always been very
good on their guarantee, and can be replaced anywhere in the country.   

  If anyone has any information, please post it to the list, as I am sure
others would like to know this information.   Frankly, I was surprised to find
out how difficult it is to find a battery for a 944.  I have yet to find a
battery dealer that states they have one for a 944.

thanks for the help
