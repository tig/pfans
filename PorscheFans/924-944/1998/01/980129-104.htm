Yes, this is the first of the season time trials for the local (Golden 
Gate Region) Porsche club.  It is open to Porsche club members after you 
have signed the waiver at the gate.  I'm not sure about the general 
public, but I have never been asked about a membership card upon 
attending one of these so I would guess yes, it is again after singing 
the waiver.

It includes a drivers ed in the time trial.  Usually Satuday is all 
practice sessions along with Sunday morning.  Then on Sunday afternoon, 
the timed runs begin and take about three hours.  

You will see a variety of cars from stock all the way up to fully 
prepared versions this weekend.  Saturday is the best day for viewing.  
Don't know what format (track configuration) they will be using yet since 
I'm not sure how far the changes to the track have progressed.  you 
should enjoy it.
