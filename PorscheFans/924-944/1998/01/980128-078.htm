I had a similar problem with my '77 924 - after doing the head gasket, the
engine ran so cool (don't mock my bad English!) that it sat at the top of
the first solid white region on the temp guage, rising only when coming to
a stop after high speeds, and dropping back down within a couple of
minutes. The thermostat that was in there was an 82 deg. unit.

After many complaints from my wife about cold feet, I took it upon myself
to install the 88 deg. thermostat I got (without knowing it was 88
deg.) when I purchased my head gasket kit. It now warms up much more
quickly, provides a nice useable amount of heat, and sits at the first hash
mark after the white solid region. I expect to go back to the 82 deg.
thermostat in March, once things start warming up.

Give it a try with a hotter thermostat, though you might want to just make
sure beforehand that you're not suffering from a poor contact on the
temp sender...
