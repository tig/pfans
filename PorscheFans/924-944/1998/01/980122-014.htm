Hello to All:

Well I bought the 87 951 I had been looking at. What is PCNA's phone
number? I wish to call and request some information.

Thanks to the listmembers for all your help during the prepurchase
phase. Now, on to ownership:)

I plan on retensioning the belts this weekend, if the tool shows up in
time. They have about 9k miles on them. The balance belt "feels" very
loose, but the cam belt "feels" about like my Honda's. Are there
instructions for using "The Tool" anywhere? I would guess that the
measurement is taken at the longest section of belt not supported by
gears or pulleys. Looks to me like a tight fit to check the cam belt.
Any help would be most appreciated. 

Anyone know what version of APE software has the DME computer chip
number as follows: 951.020.200.DME? E-mailed Autothority several days
ago, but not had a response yet. I had the computers out while fixing
the battery box. 

During the battery box repair, I removed the right inner fender and
found surface rust on the fender, door post, and the underbody where the
fender and floor pan come together. I find it hard to believe that there
is not a drain tube to avoid all this potential damage. Keep your
batteries boxes clean, and check your inner fender.

Enough rambling, I must get back to work so I can afford parts!
