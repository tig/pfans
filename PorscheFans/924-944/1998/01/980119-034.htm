Jeff,
       I sounds a lot like your DME relay (in the fuse box) is starting to
fail. When the relay starts to degrade it will demonstrate difficult
starting and running when the engine is hot  but, does fine when the engine
is allowed to cool for a period of time. The strange part is that you
normally notice it long before it reaches the point of hesitation and
stalling while the car is running. It usually first appears as a difficult
start after the car has been running at normal operating temperature and
then stopped and allowed to sit for 10 to 15 minutes. When this is the
case, allowing to sit for 30-45 minutes allows it to cool enough that it
will start.  Also, when the symptoms first start to appear, if the car is
hot and you shut it off, it will normally restart if you try it within the
first 10 minutes. Don't ask me what's so magical about that 10 minute
period but,  they all seem to fail in a very similar fashion. As far as the
car starting when your GF jumped you (pardon the expression),  how long did
the car sit before you tried to jump it?  If it sat long enough, it could
be that the car started as a result of the DME relay cooling and not as a
result of the jump.

I don't know where you're located but, Europroducts (800-962-0911) usually
has the DME relay for around $40 US. Hope this helps. Let us know what you
find.
