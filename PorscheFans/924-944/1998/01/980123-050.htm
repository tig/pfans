Welcome to the group Rbric@aol.com,

I also have a 1980 924 turbo (a.k.a., 931) and once experienced the same sort 
of problem you have.  It turned out not to be the distributor that was at fault,
but the coaxial wire that runs from the distributor to the ignition control box.
This is the trigger wire for the ignition system and the plastic insulation had
baked and cracked and the inner wire was shorting on the outer shielding.  To
check this, test for a short circuit across the two leads at the control box.
If you have a short and need a new wire, you're in for the shock of your life
when you hear what the new wire costs.  Actually, I was told I had to buy the 
entire engine wiring harness at $500+.  Instead, I positioned the coaxial wire
so that the short was opened and used epoxy to freeze the wire in that position.
The short was right up next to the distributor.

Good luck.  Hope this helps.
