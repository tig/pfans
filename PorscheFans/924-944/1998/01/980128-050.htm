Doug,
I'm thinking this is normal. Mine runs just below the first mark on the =
highway and sometimes just above the lefthand open rectangle. It does how=
ever start registering a temp rise within a few hundred yards of putting =
the car in motion regardless of outside temperature. So if your not seein=
g needle movement pretty quickly then maybe something is wrong.

If your in doubt you may want to check the resistance of the engine temp =
sensor located under the intake manifold. The Haynes manual gives specs =
for hot and cold engine. You could also feel the upper radiator hose shor=
tly after driving the car to be sure the coolant is heating up.

Anybody know what that brake check valve does specifically?I'm curious.

Hope this helps,
Joe
