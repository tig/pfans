Yes it does, but it requires an increase in pressure to get enough fuel =

Ken,
I thought that the 944 DME carried out the cold-running fuel
enrichment by widening the pulse width of the fuel injector's
"on time".  Is that not correct?  Also, are you certain that
the fuel pressure is boosted by a thermal vaccum switch?  In
Charles Probst's book, he says that Pulsed FI systems (like
Motronic) maintain a constant relative fuel pressure (the=20
difference between manifold and fuel rail pressure).=20
