Hi,

I bought a pair of Infinity Kappa 4x6 speakers to install in the door
panels of my 1990 S2, but I'm now having reservations about them because
of the fit.  Has anyone installed these speakers in a late model car with
the "snap-on" type grills.  If so, how did you do it?  The speakers =
aren't
DIN size and therefore the grills are too large.  I've thought about =
using
the screw-on grills like on earlier cars but the Kappas don't cover all
the exposed door metal around the cutout on my car (the corners are dog
eared), so I think there might be some of the metal exposed and this =
would
look tacky.

Any hints would be appreciated.  Otherwise I'm sending them back and will
go with a more custom install.  If I send them back anyone want them
before I do?  They list for $169 and I paid $85.  Thanks.
