I just had a chance to see all the notes about support for this project!
Great!

On my web page, I have a link to sort of a planning page.  There I have a
list of contributors and what they will contribute as well as a list of
other projects for the video I've seen proposed.

E-mail me directly and then get started on the tape.  It has been mentioned
that lots of these will have to wait until we get nicer weather but for
anyone that can help it will be apprecitated more than words can express.

Regarding the cost/business side, I truly believe that this shoud be a
"not-for-profit" venture, i.e. keep the cost as low as possible.  I'm
certainly willing to entertain ideas about professional production but only
if the services were to be donated.  Otherwise I have no problem compiling a
master video and then duping it from VCR to VCR.

E-mail me directly and I'll send you the address to send your tape to.  Give
us a brief introduction to yourself and your car (year, model,
modifications, special things of note) and then dive into your project.
Track footage would be great too!   Especially beating those lousy Mustangs!
