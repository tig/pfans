Regarding the posts I have seen on this topic --

As a point of information, the 944 16" forged "Five Spoke" wheels were a
$1200 option back in 1985 over the standard "Cookie Cutters". My 85.5
car had 'em, and I just rechecked the price (on the original sticker) to
verify what I recall from memory. Yes, I was the original owner of the
car. It was my 30th birthday present to myself, tho I was still 29 at
time of delivery... :)

As for dealers swapping stuff around on you, it does happen. In my case
with the 85.5 car, I got a cheapo air compressor, way inferior to the
sturdy, integral plastic case unit I got with my '84 944 as the third
owner.
