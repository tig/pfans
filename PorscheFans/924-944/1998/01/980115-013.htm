My solution:
Upgraded Girlfriend 1.0 to Wife 1.0 SE (Special Edition)
I had very different bugs than the Girlfriend 1.0 edition.
The Wife 1.0 symptoms are as follows:
During the 944 prepurchase mode the unit (Wife 1.0) got stuck in a =
repeating audio loop. I never did pay too much attention to  the content =
but it had to do with something like "young blondes", a mid-life =
something or other, loss of capital and my general mental state.
This condition was remedy by the actual purchase of the 944. Wife 1.0 =
thought it had a certain visual appeal and now Wife 1.0 could be seen in =
a Porsche and be a Porsche owner by association. (Gave Wife 1.0 her copy =
of PCA card so she could verify this with friends)
The final step to remove all bugs in Wife 1.0 was to let her operate the =
944. The first tight corner (marked 10mph) was navigated by Wife 1.0 at =
40 mph. The only audio response was "cool".

Warning - The only repercussion was that Wife 1.0 did not appreciate her =
Trooper any more, eventually had to upgrade the Trooper to a BMW 3 =
series. (Wife 1.0 still wanted 4 doors)

Disclaimed - This will not happen with all Girlfriend upgrades. I have =
herd of some disastrous bugs appearing due to the upgrade. Could be an =
imbedded virus.

PS - Its possible that my copy of Girlfriend 1.0 had some code rewritten =
before the upgrade. While Girlfriend 1.0 was fairly new I gave her a =
ride around Pocono racetrack in my Shelby GT-350 and completed a series =
of high speed agricultural pirouettes. She laughed.
