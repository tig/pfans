I'm very confused about adjusting the clutch on my 1977 NA 924 after reading
the Haynes manual.

A bit of background first, the car has been converted to RHD and has a 30 mm
thick spacer in the clutch cable at the fire wall to take up slack in the
cable.  Clutch cable appears to be in good condition.  The PO replaced the
clutch about 20 000 km ago.  The clutch doesn't slip at all but feels
somewhat spongey and engages too far away from the floor.

The Haynes manual says to adjust the operating lever before adjusting the
cable using the following instructions:  I have included my queries in brackets

1)  Insert a large screwdriver through the inspection hole and position the
release bearing on the diaphragm spring.  (In Haynes it appears that the
release bearing is fixed to the back of the bellhousing by a spring.  What
does this step mean and what does it achieve anyway?)
2)  Turn the outboard lever until the distance between the clutch lever and
the adjusting bracket is 138 mm.  (Does this mean just turn the lever or
loosen the lever on the shaft and reset it at 138 mm?  At present the
distance is 170 mm.  Are the clutch lever, the outboard lever and the
operating lever the same thing? ie, the lever that the clutch cable attaches to)
3)  Adjust the cable at the bracket until the distance between the clutch
lever and adjusting bracket is 138 mm (didn't we just do this?) and the
pedal free play is 20-25 mm from the top of the pedal.

At this stage I am very confused.  Is the clutch way out of adjustment, is
something not quite right with the RHD conversion, why is there a 30 mm
spacer in the cable, am I getting worried over nothing?  Please reply
directly to me if you can help.
