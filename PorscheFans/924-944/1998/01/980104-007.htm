As an owner of a 1987 944S with 55,000 miles on the odometer I am quite 
concerned about the possible catastrophic failure of a 16 valve head with 
a "ticking time bomb", as George Beuselinck calls it, inside.

While I think that it is a good idea to rally the support of individuals 
with the 944/928 chain tensioner problems, I am concerned that we may be 
using a shotgun to exterminate a pesky fly.

I would be very interested in pursuing this matter, but given the 
excellent reputation of the PCNA to resolve problems with owner's cars I 
am hesitant to jump into the legal bandwagon until we have exhausted all 
other avenues.

I salute Rick for taking up the torch on this issue and would like to 
have more data on this problem.  I would hope that all of the 16 valve 
944 and 32 valve 928 owners would work with Rick.  I would also like us 
to get a copy of that data so as to understand the issue in its complete 
form before entering into a legal action or even a formal request to PCNA.

Thank you Rick for your post and please keep us updated.
