Hi All,

THE DETAILS FOR THE PORSCHE ENTHUSIASTS CLUB (UK) GIVEN IN YESTERDAYS
PORSCHE FANS POSTING ARE WRONG!
The telephone number is wrong and Lyn Redall is no longer secretary.

The Porsche Enthusiasts Club is what used be called the PORSCHE 924 to
968 Club.
The name was changed when Aircooled models were included into the club
about six months ago. We have a Bi-monthly magazine, Technical
helplines, Discounts from certain Insurance companies, a free valuation
service and no snobs.

We have split the country into around a dozen areas for monthly meets
and the organisation of social events, each is controlled by a regional
officer (I am RO for NE England). We organise and attend events all
around the country. We have supplied cars and data for articles in
Practical Classics, Max Power and Porsche & 911World. We won best club
stand at: the NEC classic car show in 96 (& most improved club),
Walton Hall 97, Fins & Chrome 3 1997 (first time a
non-American car club has won an official show & shine award).

We have around 1000 members. Most of whom run older cars. The club is
run by volunteers. We only have one employee, Karen who runs our club
office. Our annual membership fee is 24.50 pounds plus a one off 5pound
joining fee usually. But we have a special offer on this year of
25pounds for family membership including joining fee.

Phone Karen at our club office on 07000 924 968 911 for more details.

Club Office address is:
57a High Street,
Yarm,
Stockton-on-Tees
TS15 9BH

Tell her I was talking to you.


Bye for now.
