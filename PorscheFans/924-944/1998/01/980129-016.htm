Greetings,
On a little drive across the Arizona desert yesterday, I decided to run =
the air conditioner for a bit. Since the temperature was around 77 =
degrees I thought this would be a good time to see if it still works. =
Well, it did work when I bought the car and now it doesn't. Seems the =
car dealer might have charged the system instead of fixing the problem. =
Nothing new there.
Is there a place in the air conditioning system that is a common spot to =
check for leaks or should I shove my Beagle under the hood to use as a =
sniffer to find the problem area? Animal rights people need not respond =
to this post please.

Getting warmer,
John
