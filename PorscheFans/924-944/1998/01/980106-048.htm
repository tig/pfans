Yeah, Lee, but it's a lot more fun for the rest of us to watch a ball
player be right 30% of the time than it is to watch a businessman screw up
70% of the time. Hard to imagine bleachers in the board room.  But on the
other hand, I've been to some faculty meetings that were worth the price of
admission -- only problem is we haven't figured out how to keep score yet.
