TO ALL THOSE BRITS OUT THERE!!!!

I have spoken to Nim at Autobahn about Walton Hall 98.
The whole 98 event is on hold due to Walton Hall increasing their rates.
The event may take place at another venue or it may not take place at
all.
How much the original PORSCHE 96/97 concept will be diluted is not known
yet.
I was told nothing will be decided until mid January.

I am stuck in Africa until 6 Feb.
Is anybody out there calling into AUTOBAHN over the next few days??????
If so could you ask about the progress of the Event??????

As many phone calls as possible from as many people as possible would
not go amiss. Just to try to tip their hands on the event so it takes
place.

ALTHORP is cancelled and similar type event will be run a Silverstone
this year.
I would hope Nim gets WH back on track c/w Bruce Anderson etc.
Imagine loosing both our big events in one year.
