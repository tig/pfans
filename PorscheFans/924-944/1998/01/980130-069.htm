Ala,

I don't think I can answer your general question, but at least I'll 
add this data point:
A 1994 968 with ~22500 miles was offered for sale by a dealer in the 
Seattle, WA area for US$27,900, and seems like it sold for about 
$26.8k.
The car was in very nice condition, except for the following:
-2 scratches (about 4 " and 6" long) in paint near gas filler
-Rock impact on one fog light lens
-Radio (CR-1) non-operational; antenna, compressor, and toolkit 
missing.


Chris

Hi P-fans,

What is going on with the 968 market value.

About a month ago a fellow P-fan wrote that he bought a 93 968 Coupe 
in
Florida for USD17,500.

In Excellence magazine (as featured on Seifeld) 3 968's were sold in 
the
last month for:

93 968 Coupe 19K miles perfect condition USD27,000
93 968 Cab 44K miles interior like new, exterior some stone chips
USD33,500
95 968 Cab 30K miles excellent condition USD36,000
