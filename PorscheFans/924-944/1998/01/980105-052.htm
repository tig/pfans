>>>I took my reading with help from a "freind" who read the
boost gauge. It was cold out aprox 38' F when I did these
runs. My readings were as follows:

			1st gear = 10 psi
			2nd gear = 14 psi
			3rd gear =  14 psi
			4th gear =  19 psi
			5 th gear = 19 psi

>>>

Are you sure you don't mean 19" of  vacuum?

<< I am planning on doing the belt change some time in January and was
 wondering if anyone had any detailed instructions for this process.  It
 seems like I have heard someone mention having written such
 instructions.  I have the Haynes manual and the factory manuals already.
 I plan on changing all four belts, roller, tensioner etc.  Any other
 suggestions on items to change(seals, waterpump, thermostat etc.) while
 I am in there?  What about tools necessary to complete the job(besides
 the P9201)?  Any information  would be greatly appreciated.
 thanks and Happy Holidays

Bart,
Depending on the mileage on the water pump, you might consider it especially
with the hot summers down here AND the savings in labor considering the pump
will cost less than labor to change it.

All,
Does anyone know anything about an updated crossover pipe for the 951?  It's
supposed to have a removable mid section that the bellhousing will clear (so
you don't have to inbolt the manifolds and turbo).

All,
I just installed adjustable collars w/ 2-1/2 inch springs and camberplates on
my '86 951.  The collars slide right over the sport Koni's.  I like it.  I had
the Weltmeister (Eibach) 250# springs (variable rate) and now have standard
2-1/2 inch springs at 250#.  The car feels much more connected to the road.  

I computer aligned it.  For $45 I got to hang out and tell them exactly how to
I wanted it setup.  I ended up going with  -(1-1/2) degree camber, 1/16 inch
toe in, and 2.4 and 2.5 degrees caster.  Since my last alignement a couple of
years ago (maybe 1-1/2 years?) I've had the balljoints rebuilt (ala pulled the
Aarms) and replaced the front suspension.  I had it set at -2.4 and -1.7
degrees camber.  Not to bad for eyeballin' it.

ANYWAY, th point of this post is the toe in increases 0.35 degrees with ever
-0.5 degrees camber change.  So if I decide to kick the camber down for track
to say -3 degrees camber, I'll be running  1.05 degrees of toe in!    What's
the scoop?  Won't this EAT my tires?  Sounds like it would just make it push
and increase tire wear.

For Bob (and the list):

The '89 951 has the special pipe with the extra section.  There is a good
description and picture of the area in the factory Turbo Service Manual
Supplement.

This extra junction makes it more convenient to repair the clutch, but the
trade-off is an extra place for a power-robbing exhaust leak.

What's the price on the timing chain tensioner?

Thanks
