     Whether NBC, ABC, CBS or the newer networks can be trusted is actually
the question
of the century, not whether Sears occasionally sells old batteries as new.
     I don't doubt that Sears, Montgomery Ward, Goodyear or your local
Joe's AAMCO cheat
people occasionally, it is a given.   Unfortunately with the track record
of the major network
investigative reporting shows like 60 Minutes, the expose on unintended
acceleration
that almost ruined Audi, the exploding gas tanks with model rocket motors
installed on GM trucks,
the stupid roll-over SUV tests, the airbags forced down our throats by
so-called experts like Nader...
     GM and Ford and Chrysler have always made some cars that are junk.
The auto dealers
will (until the way of selling cars changes) always try to get the upper
hand in any deal, and the repair
department will always try to find whatever might need to be replaced in
the next 20 years, especially
if you are a woman and charge you triple.
     I've been burned by  shops before, but I'll never trust the press, at
least as long as the news divisions
are staffed by suits and people like Dan Rather anchor.
