I've always wondered how instructors have the patience and courage to go
out with 6-8 beginners over the course of a weekend.  Most have been good
humored about my mistakes, e.g., like after doing a 180 due to early
throttle on an exit -- "Hmm. Interesting. Haven't seen this part of the
track from this angle before." Do you guys rehearse this stuff?  

Cobb's comment that "the only time I want your car at 100% is at the apex"
was instructive.  Also the idea of trading lateral and linear traction.
Particularly useful in a car with no LSD.  One comment I found puzzling in
the article was to do more coasting.  I assume this means setting up for
early apexing and early acceleration out of a corner, but it seems to
contradict all the textbook admonitions to be either hard on the brakes or
hard on the throttle.

Some instructors are very good about this. I've warned instructors that
I'll be taking a different line next time and they're willing to work with
someone else's instincts, despite a relative lack of experience.  On the
other hand, I've had instructors try to get me to do things the car cannot
handle, even if you warn them -- like standing on the throttle too early in
a tight exit in a car with no LSD.  Particularly not appreciated when
there's a concrete wall 5 ft away.

Something that's rarely done at Drivers Ed ( and I understand why) is
occasionally putting less experienced drivers in with an advanced group.
This can really help some rookies ready for the next step.  I've seen their
times drop considerably after one session just by have to pick up the pace
and following the lines of experienced drivers.  It's also a good exercise
in humility that is essential for advancing to the next level.
