Everyone -

        First a vote of thanks from a newcomer to the list & FAQ - as a 
result of reading it I feel much more comfortable with the '87 924S I 
bought last year. Unfortunately, there's a downside to this, akin 
to reading a medical dictionary - you soon imagine you have every disease 
under the sun! Which brings me to my question -what next? Let me explain:

        When I bought the car 6 months ago, it had a FPSH and 104K. I had 
a cheap-but-well-regarded local mechanic carry out (in essence) a 12,000 
mile service and change the belts (the only trouble since then has been a 
failed slave cylinder).  My local dealership (H.R. Owen in St Albans) said 
the geometry was suspect (I had a 74-point check done while the car was 
with them for the slave cylinder fix) and they charged me 184 pounds (300 
dollars!) for a "geometry check" (bargains like this I can do without - 
anyone know why it's so expensive?). After reading the list for a while, 
I'm wondering about the water and oil pump situation. Should I have them 
changed/inspected? On a broader note, should I go to the dealership and 
try to bring the FPSH status back with a full 30,000 mile service? I 
hesitate to think what it would cost, though, hence the cry for help (I'm 
fairly sure the local guy isn't the ideal solution either, though). I 
don't begrudge spending money to maintain the car properly in the least 
(it may be modest but it's my pride and joy) - however, I don't want to 
throw the stuff away either, so I'd welcome any advice (and suggestions 
for alternative mechanics) with open arms. How much difference would the 
FPSH make on a car with so many miles, should I sell it? Anyone know? 

        A piece of (perhaps) hypochondria: I note the comments about the 
DME relay "beginning to act up" symptoms (hesitation when warm-starting). 
My machine exhibits these symptoms, though not as severely .. so where 
does this beast lurk, how difficult are they to remove, and what 
maintenance is it possible for a man who knows which end of a soldering 
iron is which to carry out on them? Are replacements massively expensive?

        Finally, if anyone's still awake: am I correct in thinking that if 
I buy the Haynes manuals for the 924 and NA 944, the NA 944 manual will 
cover the essentials of the drivetrain, and the 924 manual 
everything else? As so (relatively) few 924S's were made it seems that 
aftermarket publications specifically for that model don't really exist - 
or is there one I've missed? Alternatives? I don't plan on doing anything 
extensive at all, so absolute accuracy isn't really a requirement, but 
it's nice to have a goodish idea of how and why the thing works. And even 
for modest tasks a manual makes a world of difference - opinions? 

        Thanks for "listening" (and a belated Happy New Year) to all,     
  
                Pete

1987 924S - feels good to see that there :-)
