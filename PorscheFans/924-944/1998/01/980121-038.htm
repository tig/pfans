That is one UGLY 928.  I only hope this conversion doesn't turn out to be in
vain. The last couple of times I've gone to Denmark (Christmas and October)
I've seen new Camaro Z28s registered as Pick-up truck WITHOUT turning the
trunk into a bed. I'm not sure what the rules are exactly, but apparently by
removing the rear seats and claimin that the "trunk" of the coupe was
comparable to cargo space people have gotten away with this.

Hurts my eyes and my heart to see one of the most beautiful cars ever built
destroyed like the 928 on the pics.

Just my 2 cents.

By the way, I got around the outragous taxes by moving to the US - the
ability to buy my 944S2 CAB did not play a small part in the decision to
move :-)
