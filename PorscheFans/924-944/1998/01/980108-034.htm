Lee,

	I resent your comment that I am "just a little "sick"." That
could not be farther from the truth. I am basically warped, which is at
least two deviations  from the norm.

So there !

	We're not paid to forget (or is that "we're paid to not forget",
or is that
	"we forget when we're not paid".......I forget

	Also, Roxanne, Dan isn't anywhere near as "straight-laced" as
his comments
	to the list might indicate, just a little "sick".
