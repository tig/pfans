Didn't think you were supposed to listen to customers. At least no one
listens to me. And I'm right at least 20% of the time.

I get the distinct impression that you're against the idea of using open
link chains.  I figure I should replace the chain in another 40K miles
(total of 85K miles), and by that time I might want new valves, and the
head and valves ground to optimize performance, etc, etc.  So the chain
will be replaced at that time. At least that's the best and easiest idea I
can come up with right now.  I've heard that the chain should be good for
100K miles (any conflicting opinions?). Should be ticking pretty loud by
then.

Does that mean if it only turns 6000 rpm, I'll get 24 months out of it?

I think they all tick, even if the belts have just been replaced.  The only
good thing about it is that if the engine goes, I'll have a great excuse to
sink money into a 968 engine.

Thanks for the input. How's the 951 working out?
