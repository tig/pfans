This is the kind of question I can answer...simple ones.

I've noticed this too that if you put the nozzle in too far the automatic=
 shutoff kicks in. It must be the angle. I've noticed it with other cars =
as well.

As far as how much gas I can get in after shutoff. Its generally about =
1.5 gal. You want to pause after each shutoff and listen for gas to stop =
gurgling(in the Taurus I get more than 3 gal after the first shutoff!!). =
Then you can add more until it overflows. I know your not supposed to fil=
l it up that full but I can never seem to stop myself. Usually I fill up =
just before my 60 mi. drive home so its not overfilled very long.

I have also tried to see how far I can go on a tank.Even so far as to tak=
e a full gas can along in case I run dry but I never let it go that far. =
I decided it wasn't safe to keep the gas can in the car during 95 degree =
weather. The most I have been able to add is about 16 gal and that was =
running some 45 miles after the low fuel light came on. I should have had=
 another 45 miles left in the tank.
