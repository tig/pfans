I too replaced a battery at Sears and let them choose the best fit since
they couldn't find a replacement listed.  They chose wrong and it lasted
about 7 months (under rated).  Since it was under warranty I returned it
and had it replaced with what they call their International battery
(designed for Mercedes and BMW which had the right footprint and terminals
and about 50% more cranking power- sorry don't have the model no.).  It's
been working fine for about a year now.
