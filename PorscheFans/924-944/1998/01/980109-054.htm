I have an 89 851 (with the S suspension bits) and have just ordered a set of 
9x16" rims from    R. Woods that were 993 take offs I believe.  I am 
considering lowering the car, and want to know the pluses and minuses. I am 
planning on putting the new yoko 032s  245-45-16s all around if I can find 
them promptly. the car will be driven on the street about 5k miles yearly, for 
short trips only. the konis are set to full hard all around and ride is stiff 
but acceptable  	if the car is lowered will the loss in susp. travel make the 
ride that much worse?   Also what gain in handling mmight be expected? 					 
tia for your advice

Ahh N.B.C. Aren't they the ones that brought us the exploding gas
tanks on G.M. pick-ups, helped only slightly by a small explosive device.
Sears has somewhere around 1000 auto centers and is bound to have 
some people that don't read the rules or follow procedures.  I'd be more
inclined to believe it was a screwup on the part of Sears than believe a  so
called investigative reporter who deliberately deceived the sales person.  
The bit about adjusting batteries costing the store money is taken out
of context. The goal here is to make sure that in fact the battery is the
problem and not a problem with the charging system.  If the battery is
defective the manufacturer will reimburse Sears.  It's no skin off their
nose.  No I don't work for Sears or a battery company,  but I have been
supplier representative to them for the last 6 years.   
O.K. I'll get off the battery er.... soap box
