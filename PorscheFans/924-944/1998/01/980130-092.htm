I am cautiously optimistic that the surgery was successful, and the diagnosis
of a full recovery might be possible for my 1988 924S DME.  About 100 miles
and a dozen or so starts under the belt, and so far so good.  Here are the
lessons learned:
1.  THE DME WILL STOP YOU DEAD.  Oddly enough, by coincidence I was re-reading
the December 1997 Pano today and what to my wondering eyes should appear, but
an article on DME relays.  Take head, these cars are now getting old, and any
crack in a solder joint or fried electric component in a DME or DME relay will
shut down the fuel pump at once, and you will stop right then.  I have a
feeling it’s more likely than not to happen at some point in every 944 owner’s
life.
2.  NEW DME UNITS LIST FOR $1600.00 U.S..  At least for my unit anyway.  A
parts source my mechanic had sold them new for $1100.00.  He suggested
anything under $500.00 for a used one would be a good deal.  Several people
here in this list offered to sell me a used one for about $250.00.  If I was
walking down the street and found $250.00 on the sidewalk, I would buy a used
one for a back-up in a minute.  But since that never happens to Porsche
owners, I’ll just keep going to church on Sundays.
3.  DME UNITS ARE DIFFERENT FROM YEAR-TO-YEAR.  My ‘88 does not take the same
unit as the ‘87.  Probably has a lot to do with the extra 10 horses.  Not
saying the others would not work, but the parts numbers are different, and
they do not cross reference with once another.
4.  IF YOU EVER SUSPECT A BAD DME - TAKE IT TO A GOOD ELECTRONICS REPAIR
FACILITY.  My man found 2 definitive cracked solder joints, and one suspect
one.  Total cost of his repair - $25.00.  Even if your shop cannot find
anything, that’s peanuts compared to the price of a new unit, and well worth
the time and risk.

Oh yes, and one final thing:  Now my interior courtesy light (dome light)
works, and goes off automatically after about 15 seconds.  It used to go off
as soon as I closed the door.  I had no idea this was ever a feature on the
car, and I have no explanation for why this now works, other than maybe there
was either a loose wiring harness before, or it was somehow wired through the
DME.  Anyway, like I said, I go to church on Sundays, so maybe I am better off
just accepting it.
