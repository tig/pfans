Sounds like MAJOR vacuum leak (no pun intended). At idle, the throttle =
plate is closed and vacuum at the intake manifold is at max. Get a piece =
of plastic tubing to use as a stehoscope and listen in various locations =
for the leak.

     I have a 89 944na with a recently developed rough idle. Replaced =
cap &=20
     rotor which didnt do anything for idle. The car is mis-firing but =
as=20
     soon as gas is given the car runs fine. Some further details are, =
w/=20
     hood open and listening to car at idle there seems to be a sucking=20
     sound, at the rough idle. As soon as gas is given teh sucking sound =

     goes away. Does anyone think that it couls be one of the injector=20
     seals? or the injector itself. I have also put injector cleaneer =
the=20
     latest tank of gas but this hasn't done anything.=20
    =20
     Has anyone had similar problems? What wat the fix?

     Thanks in advance,
