I finally got my K-26 out today with a little tech support from
PorscheFans & PowerHaus.  The shield over the steering shaft kept me
from seeing the second allen bolt holding the turbo.  After removing the
shield I saw the bolt but my allen socket was too wide to get straight
enough to go in.  I broke the curve off of a long allen wrench with
rounded end and used it in another allen socket I found which it would
fit into.  Confused?  Well anyway it worked and the last bolt came
loose, I thought.  I pulled the turbo but it would still not come out.
There was one bolt left in the out pipe attaching it to the engine.  It
was very tedious getting this bolt out as there was little room to get
to it.  I had to use a small wrench from under the car and turn it about
1/4 turn at a time until out.  The turbo is now out.

After the K-26 is out  you have to change out some parts on the turbo.
There is a large banjo bolt with some coolant lines which has to be
slightly modified to fit over the larger turbo housing.  If anyone is
interested I will relay more of my experiences with this ordeal.

Today I ordered the PowerHaus Head and Head Gasket Set.  Since I have to
remove the head anyway I thought I would try an upgraded one.
Compression is raised to 8.3 to 1.  I haven't decided whether or not to
order the modified manifold but I may.  As soon as I get the turbo
installed I'm going to start pulling the head.  It will be a miracle if
my car ever runs again.
