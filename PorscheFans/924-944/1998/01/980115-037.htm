I've sent e-mail out to several different people asking this question. I
thought I'd put it out for the whole list to see if I can get some
additional information. There is one part of 944 sunroof operation that has
plagued me for quite sometime. I've seen a number of sunroof failures on
944s with plastic gears. The majority of the failures seem to be stripped
gears, and the gears appear to strip because the drive cable continues to
pull when retracting the lifting arms to facilitate roof removal.  I was
always under the
impression that in the retracted (or released) position, one of the
microswitches would function to stop the roof.  I have been studying the
shop manual closely and comparing it to the arrangement in my car and this
does not appear to be the case. It is fairly obvious looking at the shop
manual that Microswitch III stops the motor when the roof is in the fully
raised position. When lowering the roof, the motor is stopped in the
"locked" position when the cam mechanism hits Microswitch I. This is
somewhat difficult to see on the shop manual drawing but, fairly easy to
see when looking at the actual mechanism in the car. Once the roof is in
the "locked" position, you take the ignition switch to the No. 1 position
and operate the console switch to retract the arms to remove the roof. As
soon as the arms start to move Microswitch II is made. Microswitch I and II
remain depressed while the arms are fully retracted. When you return the
lifting arms to the "locked" position, the motor stops when Microswitch II
is released. It appears to me that the only function of Microswitch II is
to stop the motor when going from the retracted to the locked position.  So
what keeps the motor from stripping the plastic gears? It appears that
there is no limit switch that stops the motor when the arms are fully
retracted.  I noticed that there is a procedure in the shop manual for
adjusting the slip clutch on the motor. Are the gears protected by
adjusting the torque for the slip clutch to a low enough value to keep the
motor from stripping the gears?  If anybody knows or has any ideas, please
e-mail me at my home address. (fletch@twave.net)
