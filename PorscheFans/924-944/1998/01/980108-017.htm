Yes, the "basic" battery controversy has been active over the last week or
so, but this is the first time the "fraud" issue has been brought up - very
enlightening.  I think I can speak for a whole bunch of us when I say
"THANKS FOR MENTIONING THIS".

Granted, Sears probably isn't the only retailer to attempt/practice this
type of deception, but they do have a reputation for sometimes
"questionable" business practices going back almost to their origin.  This
particular incident shouldn't come as any great surprise to lots of people.
