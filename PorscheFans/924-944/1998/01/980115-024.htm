Then Barry Lenoble said:

<<With my car, when you screw the filler cap on, it feels like it is
either going on easy, or going on hard, sort of like it is being
cross-threaded. Interestingly enough, when it threads on easily
is when it leaks. When it feels like it's being cross threaded
is when it does not leak. I hesitated to describe that because I
don't want people cross threading the cap, and then blaming me!

The level of fuel in the tank has no bearing on wether it leaks
or not. I've had no leaks with a full tank, and I've had the leak
when the low fuel light was on. FYI, bug and tar remover does a 
good job of getting the dried fuel gook off the car.>>

That's an intersting theory and I can understand why you might be
hesitant to share it with us. <g> I found on my NA 944 that every 2 or 3
years I'd have to replace the rubber O-ring. At least I thought I did.
Anyway, it seemed to make the gas cap not leak for a period of time. But
I think that is treating the symptom not the problem. 

Here's a theory of the true problem: The line between the gas tank and
the carbon canister gets clogged or bent which pressurizes the gas tank
forcing gas past the cap.

What do you think?
