Howdy,

A while back, someone asked me to measure my ride height from the middle of
the fender through the center of the wheel and touching the ground.  With
a full tank of gas, I got a front of around 24.5" and the rear is around
24.75".  The back comes down quite a bit with a full tank of gas!  I measured
it last with a half-tank and I think it was over 25" in the back.

Do those numbers relate to other's cars?

Second thing is, I need a stereo expert to help me with designing a SUPER
SMALL cross over.  I hate these huge boxes that ADS uses in their speakers
and feel there must be something smaller that can be made.  I've won an
IASCA competition before, but don't have any specs around anymore for
coils and caps.  I basically need something for a high pass and a low pass.
If anyone knows what ADS uses on their 200i line, that would be great info.

If you are not on Team.net, you should get on their to read about a cool
product a fellow 944 owner is creating called the GeezWhiz I believe,
basically a cool g'analyst with computer downloadable data.

Thanks,
Farzaan.
