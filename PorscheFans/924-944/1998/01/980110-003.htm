Hi there,
i own a '90 944S2 with about 105tkm. For some time i sense an easy
scratching in the gear-box during shifting (mostly while shifting from 2nd
to 3rd or from 3rd to 4th gear). I remember that shifting was smoother
about 10tkm ago or so. The clutch has been replaced 30tkm ago, so i think
the synchros are suspicious. Any other ideas? How extensive is a
synchro-replacing-job for a do-it-yourselfer practiced mediocre? What would
that cost in the workshop ?
Thanks in advance for any information!
Wolfgang

 jack the front up :(  Oh well. >>

Drive the car up onto short pieces of 2x8 and the jack will slide right under.

Timing belt broke recently and having to sell. The car is located near St.
Louis MO. 
Color-White Interior, burgandy-98K mi. No crashes & lots of newly replaced
parts over the years.

The timing belt caused damage to all 32 cylinder valves. Requires all new
valves and timing belt w/ gears etc, etc. Other than that the car is in great
shape. I received a quote for repair for approx 3-4K.

Asking price 3K as is. If interested and more details, call 314-978-0277 and
ask for Mark.
