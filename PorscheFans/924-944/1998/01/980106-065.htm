For a left-hand drive car- (Mine's NA, early int, but general rules
follow.)

Run the wires from the center console, up above the bottom edge of the
left side dash, down through the kick panel (pull the rubber trim off
the door frame, then pull the carpet out, watch out for the hatch
release switch.) Pull off the door threshold and follow the existing
harness until you hit the rear quarter panel. Using a flathead
screwdriver with the tip wrapped in duct tape, gently push the cable
into the gap between the quarter panel and the wheel well. Remove the
clips from the trunk sidewall carpeting, and run the cable down into
your storage bins, and you're done.

As another idea, I located my amp (an MTX unit) under my passenger seat.
If you cut a hole in the carpeting there (perish the thought!) you can
get just enough clearance. Some have suggested putting in spacers
underneath the seat rails. 

The CD changer is in the left side storage bin. Please, steal it so I
can get a better one. Take the speakers and deck too, but leave the amp,
if you don't mind.

Alex.
