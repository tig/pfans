We had a very similar sounding problem on an 86 951. I has a cool brake
kit, good fluid/pads ect.  Last year about mid season we slowly started
to develope the problem you had.  We had had two seasons with good to
great brakes.  Our dealer mechanic happened to be at the track that day
and said it was  the master cylinder.  We were skeptical but robbed one
of an idle car and shazam, the best brakes we ever had.  It seems it
will feel fine on the street but the heat and pressure at the track
cause some seal leakage.  They don't often leak externally. We use Hawk
pads, Ford HD truck Fluid, Cool Brake and NEW master cylinder for great
brakes all day with two drivers.
