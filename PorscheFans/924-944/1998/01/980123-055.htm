For about 10 years or so, I have been using a product made by Dave Turner
(world class auto-xer).  He calls it the "Harness Holding Strap", and he
designed it primarily for the Porsche Hi-Back seats.  The price was about
$25 back in '92.  I don't think it would be more than $30 now.  You can
contact:

	Performance World (was known as Dave Turner Motorsports)
	San Diego, CA
	800-854-6640
	619-571-3811 (CA, AK, HI)
	619-571-2859 (fax)

I use it in conjunction with 2" H-type harness attached to a regular
harness bar, and have never had any problems with it on any of my cars
('83NA; '88 TS; '93 968).  Be prepared to make a color selection.  Don't
get this confused with the infamous "Torso Harness", which is a single
strap that wraps around your chest.
