won't.
The car has 67,000km on it, which is quite low for something like the
above,
but the car has been tracked and auto-xed, as well as run as low as the
front
collars will go.  The PO had it set at that height from day one so it
must
have also worn from day 1.  We are going to replace the worn arms with
new
arms, maybe even the factory motorsport arms if we can find a price for
them.>>

Hi Farzaan,

I'd think about going to the Fabcars. I am.
