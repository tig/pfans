If your cruise adds speed, it is an easy fix.. I can repost the 
instructions if you desire.  No need to put up with it!0

I found that my clutch switch is ok.. I remembered that I did indeed put
the car in neutral with the CC engaged, which firmly planted the tach
needle into the red.  It was a bizzare experience - I thought a jet had
taken off beside me with a whoosh, but didn't realise it was my engine 
until I looked at the tach!  I was rather startled.
