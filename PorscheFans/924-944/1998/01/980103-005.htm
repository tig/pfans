Happy New Year P-Fans,

For those of you who may have missed previous postings, or those interested
in how our plans are developing, we now have about 30 P-Fans interested in
meeting at the Laguna Seca Historic Races in August where Porsche will be
the honored marquee. If you are interested and haven't contact me directly
yet, drop me an E-mail directly and I'll add you to the list!

Hotels are still quite available, but as this is the biggest event of the
year for this area and they anticipate ALL hotels within 25 miles will be
sold out, make a reservation now. You can always cancel if things don't work
out. I have information if you need it. Area info can also be found at
www.monterey.com .

The organizers expect the biggest collection of racing Porsche's ever
assembled and it looks to be a Porschephile's dream weekend. Most of the
action will be at the track with events taking place Friday, Saturday &
Sunday, August 14-16, 1998. This will be Laguna Seca's 25th Anniversary and
Porsche's 50th Anniversary as a manufacturer which gives the marketing types
to say: "promising that this may be the best Monterey Historic weekend of
all time." Given the prestige this event has enjoyed over the years, that's
quite a statement. The talk has been that Porsche will be emptying their
Zuffenhausen Museum and Vasek Polak's incredible collection is expected to
be well represented. I can't wait to hear a 917's flat-12 1000+ horsepower
at full tilt around the track. More info can be found at www.laguna-seca.com
..

We're working on the specifics right now, but hope to have a 924/944/968
corral/park to show off our toys at the track--maybe even a hospitality
tent; sharing hotel info;  evening dinner get-togethers;  and coordinating
travel caravans. If you're driving out and want to join up with other P-Fans
making the trip, I'll try to help bring things together for you.

Keeping you posted...
