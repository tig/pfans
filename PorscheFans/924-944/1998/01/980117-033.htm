I need help with a rear hatch defogger.
When 924 rear hatch struts are replaced with 944 struts, the electrical
connections for the rear window defogger are a bit different. Namely, the
944 right strut has a grounding spade terminal whereas the 924 strut is
grounded to the chassis itself.  Apparently, the circuit for both Porsches,
however, work the same way.
I assume the positive connection begins at the fore-end of the left strut,
is carried along the rod to the terminal connecting to the glass, then
across the glass to the terminal at the aft-end of the right strut. From the
terminal at the aft-end of the right strut, current runs along the strut  to
the ground at the fore- end of the right strut, grounding to the 924 chassis
directly or by way of a grounding terminal on the 944.
On my new 944 right strut, there is an open circuit between the aft-end
spade terminal on the right strut and the strut itself.  I have two
questions:
(1)  Have I understood the circuit correctly?
(2)  If the circuit does function in this manner, then could someone suggest
a way to make a connection between the terminal and the strut.
I am unable to return the strut to the (unnamed) company from whom I bought
it.  In their catalog, the numbers for the right and left strut are
reversed.  When I installed the struts by the company numbers, the relay was
blown--this was not detected in time because the defogger was not used until
after the magic no-return 30 day period.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
(I would like to note in passing that although the 944 struts are much
stiffer than 924 struts and the unnamed company recommends in their tech
tips for 924 owners to upgrade to 944 struts, I do not recommed it.  By the
time the original 924 struts begin to sag, the hatch glass and the frame
have had a tendency to separate, and this tendency will probably be
aggravated by replacement with the stiffer 944 struts.)
