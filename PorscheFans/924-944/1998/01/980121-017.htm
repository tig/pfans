Just a comment on these bushings.....the question asked was about
aftermarket bushings for a 914.....I've had some experience with Weltmeister
bushings which are less pliable than the original rubber.  I've used them on
the 944 which has A-arms formed from sheet metal.  The Weltmeister bushings
will give enough so that damage to the portions of the a arms that they fit
in is minimized.  Even so, a friend found that he had to reinforce the
bushing housings in the arms as they were cracking from working around the
less pliable Weltmeister.  Delrin is much less pliable than the material
Weltmeister uses.  I would expect that the loads transmitted thru the
mounting points to the bushing would be more than enough to crack and damage
the a-arms.  If you use Delrin and the a-arms are of thin material, I'd
check them often for cracks and reinforce them.......
