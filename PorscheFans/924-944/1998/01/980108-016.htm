Since the bleed valves on both calipers on the car have been drilled out and can no longer accomodate a bleeder valve, my only option is to put a bolt in the bleeder hole in the cylinder and hope it doesn't leak.  Furthermore, when I bleed the brakes, I would like to be able to do so with a standard bleeder valve attached to a piece of tubing so I don't get brake fluid everywhere.

Automotion sells rebuilt calipers for $66.98 each (my catalog is
#15...it might be out of date) with a 30 mo. warranty.  That should be
your best choice.  I think yours will leak, so don't even mess with
them.  I will sell you used ones for $30.00 ea, but the Automotion deal
is pretty good.  Their number is (800)777-8881 and the part numbers for
the 4-bolt wheel calipers are 477.615.107R (left) and 477.615.108R
(right).  

If I can be of further help, let me know...Don Istook
