Well, I will never be able to look at another car the same way.

The owner of the racing shop I go to, vision motorsports took me for a ride
in an unbelievable 911 yesterday. The car is for street use ONLY and it was
dynoed here at dynamics at 740 hp and 648 lbs/ft torque. The car wasn't even
running at full boost when I wasin it and it was running lean and it was
beyond unbelievable. I was so entranced, that I didn't notice my pager go
off twice (and its set on vibrate). Oh well, my 85.5 NA really didn't feel
the same when I got back in, but all it took was a few tight corners and all
was well. anyway, just thought I'd share with the group.

oh yeah and Roxanne:
<28, but I look 18>

my what a humble person..... ;-)
