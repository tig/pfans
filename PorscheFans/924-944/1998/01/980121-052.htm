On my '92 968 the following problems are annoying:
	1	The heater will come on, blast heat for a few minutes, then never
cycle on again.
	2	The rear wiper, defogger, and, inside ( left kick panel ) rear hatch
release all do not work.
	The car is superb in most all ways, I just wish it had a limited-slip
diff.  Any suggestions?   Thanks, Jim.

I resisted the temptation to get into the "my Porsche's ego can beat up your
BMW's id" debate as long as I could -- but my mischievous side got the best of
me.  I was at Watkins Glen last year at a Ferrari track event (they needed
instructors so they had to let slobs like me with lowly 944's on the track
with them).  There was a guy there with a Ferrari 333SP.  I pushed him all the
way up through the esses, until he finally let me by going into the inner
loop.  I lapped him again latter in the session. 

Therefore, I conclude that normally-aspirated 944's are faster than Ferrari
WSC cars.

Seriously, if the issue is straight-line acceleration, then look up the
numbers, see which one is quicker, and claim the bragging rights.  If, on the
other hand, we're talking about how quickly they each get around the auto-x
course or the race track, then I hope we all realize that with cars this close
in overall performance (the 944 and 325i; not the 944 and 333SP!),  driver
ability is most likely to distinguish the butt kicker from the kickee.

Hello, Once again I find myself with a new series of problems. It seems every
time I fix something, another failure appears. Now that I have spent nearly
$5000 on repairs to an 87 944s that I knew needed some help, I am beginning to
wonder where my decisions are coming from. My head or my heart.
As of this week, I have had a perfectly running car for nearly two months. The
last thing I fixed was a gear shift linkage problem. Now all of a sudden, I
have a small oil leak, 7-10 drops per day, a very soft backfire upon
acceleration, and a rattling from around the water pump or distributor cap
upon first startup. These problems all started the same day. I will have the
car up tomorrow to look for where exactly the oil is coming from. I have tried
without success to locate the source of the rattling. It doesnt sound like
metal, it sounds like plastic and only last app. 2-3 minutes upon startup. And
what could cause this backfire, it isnt a loud bang, more of a sudden
expulsion of air.
Any help would be very much appreciated.

Terry

Mine was rattling when I purchased the car.  Checking from underneath revealed
that the shield had fractured at the edge of the mounting tab.  Removing the
oil filter showed that the other mounting tab was almost fractured through.

I thought of purchasing a new bracket and upper shield but rationalized that
the new parts would be no better.  I decided to repair and strenghten this
shield.

Removing it is only difficult, replacing it is terrible.  The shield is
actually three pieces: a lower shield, a upper shield with a mounting tab and
a bracket that bolts to the block and holds the two sheilds together.  The
shields are held to the bracket by three screws, two accessable from
underneath.  The bracket falls after removing the screws.  The lower shield
cannot be removed from the area where it is mounted.  The upper shield can
just squeeze past the oil filter housing.  (Cover the housing with plastic
after removing the filter to keep dirt out.)

It took one hour each night for three nights to replace the parts.  Good luck.
