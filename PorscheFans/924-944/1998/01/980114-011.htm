Regarding the repair of corrosion on any car - it doesn't work.  There =
are many
repair methods for rust but none really work for any longer than 2 year=
s.  Any
shop that claimis it can repair rust to "as good as new" should be avoi=
ded.

Same reason that any paint protectant or rust proofing should be avoide=
d.
Paint protectants that claim to protect aginst rusting are not credible=
..  Most
rust proofing companies only protect against rust form the outside in a=
nd have
so many exclusions to make most not worth the expense.

Went in to a new car dealer once who was selling rust proofing for the =
Fierro
and Lumina minivans.  Someone explain that one to me since these cars a=
re
plastic.

There are four ways to repair rust that I am aware of.

1.  Grind out rust, pound in area around the rust spot, put in some alu=
minum
tape, fill with any bondo type product, sand and paint.

2.  Use a rust converter, fill in with bondo, sand and paint.

3.  Remove rusted section with a grinder.  Weld in a new section of mat=
eral and
finish repair.

4.  Replace entire section that contains the rust.

Of all these techniques, #4 is the best option.  This will not prevent =
rust
from re-occuring if any welding was done in the replacement of the pane=
l (rear
quarter for example)

The metal on a p-car is galvanized all around and the reason why it is =
rare to
see a rusted Porsche.

My $.02.
