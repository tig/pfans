I have an '87 951 w/ 76k miles that I recently purchased from a Porshe
dealer. The has dealer put in about $4k worth of work, partly due to a
3k mile guarantee (now over). Part of that includes the standard 60K
mile maintenance procedure and one new motor mount. That's right, one.
Is that realistic? Anyhow, the question I have pertains to the heat
shield that resides just below the exhaust header and turns up between
the most forward exhaust port and the oil filter.
When cold and just starting the engine, say below 40 degrees F, that
portion of the heat shield located just below the most forward cylinder
exhaust tube and between the oil filter vibrates and rattles like crazy.
As soon as the engine warms up there is no more vibrating and
subsequently no more rattling. By the way, the rattle is from the shield
hitting the exhaust header. I also realize that the shield vibration is
a result of the engine vibration.
I'm wondering, is this a typical idiosyncrasy that I just need to get
over or is this a symptom of a different problem?

Raymond
