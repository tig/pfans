Looking to find out about mail-order suppliers
of Porsche products, especially those with the 
lowest prices.

So far, I received the Automotion (1-800-777-8881)
catalog, and I've called Tweeks (1-800-428-2200) for
their catalog, but that's it.

Who else is out there?
(and do you recommend/not-recommend them?)

This is a repost.  Thanks again to Henry Watts, the original author.  I also
ask that you do not bombard Masuo (see below) with lengthy e-mails.  I will
post a notice to the 924/944 and 928 lists once a registration process is
announced.

I cannot tell you how much fun this is-- you'll have to try it and see for
yourself.  I is worth planning a mini-vacation around, if you live within a
reasonable distance of the Bay Area.

To the 924/944 and 928 Lists:

Thanks to Hank Watts for composing the notice.  For those of you whom may not
know Hank, he has written two books about cars.  One of them is called Secrets
of Solo Racing, which is all about AX and solo track event driving.  Great
book-- makes an excellent gift.

Anyway, I have attended the School described below, and for the last two years
served as an instructor.  Last year at the school, I had a student with a 993
turbo, which he let me drive!!!  This event always gets full almost
immediately (i.e, within a few weeks, if not days, after registration opens),
so stay tuned.  Although both Masuo and Jeff are 911 drivers, they are great
guys, and tremendous drivers.

At the school, we sometimes have some ex-pro and semi-pro racers helping to
instruct, along with the usual group of outstanding men and women from around
the Bay Area.  You'll get a lot of seat time for you money, and the
environment is safe and friendly.  Last year, we had some students who
traveled quite a distance to join us, and I believe that they found the
experience extremely worthwhile.

This School is a Porsche Club of America Zone 7 event, but anyone is welcomed
to sign up an attend, as long as they are driving a Porsche.

If you are interested, sign up immediately upon the opening of registration,
or else you may not make it in.  I will post a notice when official
registration opens.

>The dates have been set for the 1998 Zone 7 Beginner and Intermediate 
>Autocross School.  May 2 & 3 at Candlestick Park (3COM for the 
>infidels among you).  This 2-day school spends Saturday on basic
>exercises (skidpad, braking, decreasing-radius, linked turns, slalom, etc.)
>then features two autocross courses on Sunday.  Enrollment is limited
>to 90 students and it will fill up very fast once the notices hit the Zone
>7 regional newsletters in either the Jan or Feb issues.  There will be
>about 60 instructors, so the student-instructor ratio is very good.
>
>I can absolutely recommend this weekend as one of the best ways to
>get into competitive driving or to hone your skills.  I ran the school for
>a number of years.  Chairmen Masuo Robinson and Jeff Sykes took
>over last year.  All their changes have been for the better.
>
>We have had a number of people travel to the school from the southland
>and from Oregon/Washington.  Those who have done so reported that
>it was a worthwhile trip.  I would suggest that the Bay Area is a nice
>place to visit with your Porsche anyway, but the school schedule is
>pretty strenuous with lots of course time and no one's going to want
>to party very much either evening.
>
>Cost is $90.

>To proceed, contact Masuo:

>Happy holidays.
