I don't know if this is any help, but......

I own a "mature" 924 - 1983 to be exact, and I have had problems with the
Intermittent wiper setting - the wipers will just suddenly switch into
Intermittent mode on occasion (usually following a bump in the road).
Anyway, I had my local Porsche dealer check out the switch and the relay.
After spending some less-than-trivial sum having the switch replaced, it
started happening again - so then I spent another sum to buy a new relay -
I fitted this myself, and the problem went away. However, a couple of
months later the problem started recurring. I have since realised that it
is the contacts in the fuse box which are a little tired, and giving the
relay a wiggle when the problem reoccurs (every six months or so) seems to
cure the problem. If I had realised this at the outset I would have been
able to waste the money on something else - but that's life I guess.

Anyway, I wouldn't be surprised if your fiddle with your relay had a
similar affect on the contacts.

While on the subject of Fuse boxes, if your vehicle is about the same age
as mine, it would be worth having the rear screen circuit checked on the
fuse box at your next service. Basically, the original design did not allow
for the relatively large current drawn by the circuit, and was not "meaty"
enough. There is an upgrade kit which can be fitted by a Porsche dealer to
resolve the problem - I would recommend getting one fitted if required. I
first knew about it when my car started filling with smoke one day!
