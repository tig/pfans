Ganguly,
        Since '85.5, the 944 has used an electronic sensor (hall effect 
sensor) in the transaxle to measure vehicle speed. This sensor produces a 
pulse or pulses for every rotation of the rear axle. The speedometer converts 
these pulses to vehicle speed by either measuring the pulse width or frequency 
of those pulses. Likewise, the odometer clicks another tenth of a mile for 
every x number of pulses sent from that sensor. This readily lends itself to 
use as a feedback parameter to the cruise control unit. Pre '85.5 944's had a 
speedo cable driven by the left front wheel, a mechanical system. If your '84 
operates as you say, then there is a sensor (most likely located in the 
speedo) that converts the rotation of this speedo cable to an electrical 
signal that can be used by the cruise control unit. This shouldn't surprise me 
as Porsche vehicles are quality products. Most other manufacturers would have 
implemented a system that used engine RPM's, hence my assumption in my 
previous posting. I am happy to hear that your cruise control uses such a 
system, sure is a nice bonus..

Thanks,
       Ezra
