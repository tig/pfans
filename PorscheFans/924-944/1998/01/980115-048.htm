I've been in this boat for a long time and expect to be in it for even longer
since I haven't grown in a few years now and I'm still small.  Kind of like
a 22 year old person trapped in a 19 year old body :)  I still get ID'ed when
I go to the pub with some of the workers here!

>can own a Porsche.  But It's not so much as owning it as it is
appreciating it

everybody.

The thing that irritates me about co-workers is that they constantly bug
you about owning a Porsche, yet they don't realize my $30,000 Porsche is
waaaay cheaper to buy then their $44,000 SUV's.  Sure, the p-car costs more
to maintain, but I can get a lot of timing belts done for $14,000 and I get
to actually use my car for its purpose, unlike those highway riding off
road vehicles.

Here's a piece of advice, don't make it known you own a Porsche if you
want a raise and your boss drives a junker :)  Thankfully, my boss has
convinced himself to buy an 850 Turbowagen, then my raise should be
forthcoming.

Now, if only I could convince him to crank the boost on that sucker :)
