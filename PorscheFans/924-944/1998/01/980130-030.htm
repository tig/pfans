Tom,

Woah, did you notice the S2 has a .78 5th gear with the 3.89 ring and pinion
whereas the 951 has a .83.

I don't think anything is wrong.  In fact, since the S2 has a quoted top
speed of 149, your 140 looks a bit suspect.  From your previous note, gear
ratios are:

S2 --  1st: 3.50  2nd: 2.06  3rd: 1.40  4th: 1.03  5th: .78  R&P=3.88
951 -- 1st: 3.50  2nd: 2.06  3rd: 1.40  4th: 1.03  5th: .83  R&P=3.38

The 951S uses 245/45-16 tires on the rear and those would be
approximately:

[(245 * 0.45 * 2) / 25.4 + 16 ] * 3.14159 = 77.5" (smaller than S2)

rpm = 6400
tire_circumference = 77.5 inches
trans_gear_ratio = 0.83, 5th gear
diff_gear_ratio = 3.337

We get:

6400 x 77.5/(0.83 x 3.337 x 1056.0) =  169 mph

This is about 4% higher than your 162 mph.  My calculated S2 speeds are
also about 4-5% higher in each gear.  In reality I suspect that the tire
diameter, and hence circumference is a bit less than the theoretical
calculation because of the weight of the car, which does tend to reduce
the local radius where the tire meets the road.  Remember, this is all
just theory, but it does give a convenient way to compare different gear
combinations.

FWIW I'll take the 968 box :-)
