I recently removed the nose panel on my 86 951 for removal of the intercooler 
and found the paint peeling.  The underside of the rolled front edge has 
peeling paint and is starting to rust.  I would like to refinish this myself 
to halt the corrosion until I get the whole car repainted in a year or so.   I 
have done pieces a large as whole fenders before, however these P-car panels 
appear to be galvanized.  

What is the best way to refinish the corrosion effected areas without screwing 
up the rust preventing zinc.  I have used products like Naval Jelly in the 
past, but nothing beats those 3M stripping wheels to remove paint and rust.  I 
fear this will also remove the galvanizing.

Any experiences or advice would be helpful.

What started as a simple belt job has turned into an all out assault on the 
maladies of my car.
