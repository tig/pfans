I wonder why the board burnt there ?  - Could it be the print on the
circuit board was too thin to handle the current over an extended period
of time ? - A design problem perhaps ?

If so, then it will be interesting to see if anyone else notices this
area of print darkening if they have their DME box apart. - Anyone ?

If this does prove to be a "stock" fault, then it may be a good idea to
remove the DME box PRIOR to failure and "bridge" these print tracks with
insulated wire.  One thing to watch for with charred circuit boards, is
that the burnt area, being carbonised, can become conductive.  This
could lead to other problems and strange behaviour of the DME.

The flaking you are seeing will be the protective laquer coming off.
Electronic circuit boards that are expected to be used in conditions of
high humidity, are normally laquered for protection.  It would be a good
idea to clean off the loose bits and re-seal the circuit board, BEFORE
the exposed areas have the opportunity to absorb moisture and start
causing strange symptoms. Also, if you ever do any solder work on the
board, you will destroy the laquer in the area where you have worked.

I suggest you go to your local electronics parts supplier and buy a can
of laquer.  You must use the right stuff for the job, anything else may
be conductive and cause further problems.  Make sure the board is
*really* dry before you spray - wouldn't want to seal in moisture would
we ?
