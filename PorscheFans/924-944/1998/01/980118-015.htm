My AC does not work and upon examination by an AC shop they suggested there 
was a leak in the condenser.  They pressure tested it with a die and using 
a special light said the problem was the condenser and I needed a new one.
I have also talked to my mechanic about this and he said that he has never 
heard of the condenser leaking but rather the seals connecting the 
condenser.
I am wondering if there are any common experiences with the AC system not 
working before putting out $500 to get cold air!
