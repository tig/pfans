Hi Bob,

Well, as far as your clutch goes, you yourself said you don't drag race it.
When you are driving in attack mode, do you always make sure you 
have the clutch fully engaged before getting back ot the throttle as you
shift?  Maybe careful driving pays off?  My clutch has about 45,000 miles
on it, but the first 30,000 miles were with the PO.  I also run my car with
one bar and I've done a few "drag" starts.  I can count them on one hand,
and all but one were in the first month of owning the car.  My car was not
chipped when I purchased it, and examining the little tabs on the DME
seemed to indicate that it had never seen an aftermarket chip before.

Sometimes, I think I could be more careful when making the 3rd to 4th
shift--I don't think I'm outshifting the synchros, but I may tend to hit the
gas too soon in 4th.  Ah well, when the clutch goes, I guess it'll be time
to call Jason B. and spend a week or two under the car. :)

Clark
