Have a hot/cold fuel pressure check done. My 79 924 did the same thing. =
On mine it turned out to be a leaking fuel line check valve. This valve =
is integral to the fuel pump, and maintains pressure in the fuel lines =
long enough for a hot engine to cool off, thus preventing vapor-lock. =
New fuel pumps are expensive, I repaired mine by adding an all metal =
metric threaded check valve, available from an industrial plumbing =
supply house. Look for ratings that are compatible with the fuel =
pressures listed in the Haynes manual. I believe that Haynes describes =
the test for hot/cold start fuel pressure, as well as how to test the =
check valve/fuel pump. You might look in a junkyard for an Audi of =
similar year for a fuel pump. On a 79 924, they're the same, not sure =
about an 82. Also Auto Atlanta specializes in 924 parts, new/used. While =
I had good experiences with them several years ago, they seem to have =
bigger and busier and my last encounter with them was less than =
flattering.
