I have a set of excellent BFG Comp/TA M+S tires for sale. The fronts are
225/50/16 and the rears are 245/50/16. They were on a 1988 Turbo S I have
just purchased and as I live in Southwest Florida I do not need them. They
run without any shake up to 120 MPH (I haven't tried them any beyond) and I
would say have about 85% of their tread.They appear to have no uneven wear.
Although the rears should ideally be 245/45/16 they fit fine and cause about
a 2% speedo error. For someone just trying to get through the winters I
think they would be ideal.
$150 + Shipping.
