Thanks to Doug H. <dsholt@hotmail.com>, my intermittent no-run condition is
solved. The connector on the temperature sensor was gummed with dried-up
coolant--I had just bled the system a few days ago.

And now that my airbag warning light has been reset (still don't know what
caused that one), I have a new problem: the boost gauge. It reads about 0.6
bar higher than it should at all times, i.e., idle is ~1.0bar,
part-throttle accleration is 1.8 bar, and full throttle acceleration is
beyond 2.0 bar (gauge pegged). I don't have a mechanical gauge to put on
it, but I'm almost certain the car is not producing too much boost, as
performance and driveability are normal.

Where does the gauge get its signal? Is it electrical, receiving a signal
from the DME/KLR, or elsewhere?

I'm definitely going to order shop manuals this week, but in the meantime,
any help you can provide would be appreciated. Thanks in advance,

-Jeff
