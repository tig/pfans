I haven't used any Porsche specific lines (yet), but I have a set of 
Rx7 lines in my hand right this second, and the only difference I can 
see vs the non DOT approved ones (these particular ones are Russell) 
are the addition of an outer sheathing that extends about one inch 
out from the swaged (crimped) ends of the line from the fittings. These are not 
reusable type fittings.

Otherwise, the materials are the same - cad plated steel swaged on 
ends, and -3 stainless braid teflon line.

Been there; done that!
Someone proposed using silicon to reseal the light. I would suggest that
silicon is too permanent and too messy. Instead, I found an inexpensive
product in the hardware store in Canada called Duxseal. It looks, feels and
behaves just like the Porsche product but at a lot less price. For the past
two years, I have been water (and goldfish) free.
