I have both types of jack plates - for the up to 85 and for the 85.5 and up
type 944s.  They are essentially round plates with welded surrounds and the
appropriate metal dimple or nipple and or a stirrup to engage the car's
jack point.  They sit nicely in the cup of a 2ton floor jack and alleviate
the need for a scrap 2X4.  If you have a turbo be forewarned that you need
a floor jack that will go 5" or lower for you to be able to use these
devices.  I personally do not think they are worth the $15 US most places
charge for them though. (Check Tweeks, Automotion etc.)

<< Hi guys, I went by my mechanic this morning to have him check a belt that
 was noisy, and while we were looking under the hood, I noticed a fuel leak
 from the main fuel line, and it was dripping right onto the intake manifold
 and spark plugs. I guess I'm lucky that my car didn't burn up. I'm
 wondering if the price for the repair is fair. He quoted 3 hrs. labor cause
 the line goes all the way to the back, and about 220 bucks for the line and
 couplers. 
 Does that sound right to our resident experts? >>

Call Porsche (don't have the number on me) and find out if the fuel rail and
fuel line were replaced under the safety recall.
