Stanley,

The Autothority Performance Engineering (APE) chips seem the easiest to
install since they do not require shimming the wastegate or drilling the
cycling valve.  If you get the Stage 2 set you get another "banjo" bolt
with a restriction orifice that you can fine tune to regulate the max
boost level.  My son's '89 951 has APE chips (unknown version) with the
restrictor set right about 2.0 bar (on the stock gauge) and it pulls very
strong.  Like almost any turbo it does have lag below 3500 rpm and not
much torque.  Above that it's a rocket.

Don't buy your chips direct from APE.  Get them from Paragon Products,
Jason Burkett <paragon@interconnect.net> or Engine Builders Supply, EBS
RACING <EBSRACING@aol.com>.  Both can sell them well below list price.
=46or instance, list for my S2 is $495 and EBS offered them to me for =
$350.
I believe Jason would also be in that range.  Hopefully, I can try some
soon :-)
