Hi All - 
I've got a couple of questions that have been raised by some comments I've
seen here on the digest.

First I'm replacing tires on my 87 944S, stock wheels are the phone dials.
I'd like to put 225/50x15 on them. Would the lower profile create any
problem with the stock phone dials? Also, if my figures are correct, the
225/50 has about two-thirds of an inch wider tread width than the stock
205/60 will there be any clearance problems?
Next, in search of better, read brighter, headlights I was looking at the
Hella 7" lights in several catalogs. I noticed that J.C. Whitney has them
for about half the price, which leads to my next question. Do our 944s
require something special for the headlights or will any 7" replacement H4
bulb and reflector work?

Thanks in advance
87 944S - any curve any time
Dan Kara
