Failed water pump.  My second choice is a small chicken has lodged itself 
in the return line.

Okay, let's stick with the first one, but I have seen chicken feathers in 
Al Blazy's Hammond organ once when he brought it to my friend for repair. 
 We never did figure where the chicken got to.

I agree with you. The point I was trying to make is that if you put trick
parts on your car that require race car maintenance, such as unprotected ball
joints, you had best be prepared to service them as you would any critical
part of a race car. I know of too many cases where guys are running around
with FabCar arms on the street. They have installed them because they heard
they were the best but they ignore a stringent maintenance regimen. We both
know the consequences of poor hygiene on precision parts. Especially ones that
are unprotected from the elements.
Another example is the braided stainless brake lines that are all the rage.
There are too many street cars running around with those on because the owners
thought they were "trick" and inexpensive. If I recall we beat that topic to
death about a year ago.
Long time no talk to!

Jerry

Hey Lee -- As long as you're not using your 968, could I borrow the
variocam parts to see if they'll fit on my S2?

-- Nick

Hey, Lee:

As long as you have the car apart so Nick can borrow the variocam parts, how
'bout letting me borrow the 6-speed (assuming it has limited slip)
