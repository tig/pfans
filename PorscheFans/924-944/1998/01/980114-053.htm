Seeing the outstanding success in Lee's side business of parting out his 
968 I though I might enter the fold by offering a unique service to the 
PorscheFans.

Here is the deal...

I will be offering a Virtual Used Part Rental Program (VUPRP).  That is 
you can rent just about any part you need, virtually, that is.

Due to the spiraling costs of maintenance on our beloved Porsches, many 
people are forced to park their cars for extended periods while they work 
to earn the required funds for repair.  This down time is no longer 
necessary with my new, revolutionary plan.

Can't afford those main bearings yet?  Bend all your valves?  Leaky head 
gasket?  Why wait months, even years for the cash to replace with new 
parts when you can rent used parts now?

But wait, don't pick up that phone just yet, yes, there's more!  Since 
these parts are virtual, that means everything is virtually in stock.  
And if you really need that part yesterday, we offer a special shipping 
service called Tachion Express that is absolutely, positively guaranteed 
to get it there yesterday.  All parts are shipped by our own Quantum 
Mechanics, direct to you!

Now you can have virtually anything you want.  Imagine trying out a 
modifications with our Virtual Used Parts before you spend hundreds, even 
thousands of dollars.  Wide wheels, chips, used oil filters, spent 
hydrocarbons, stripped bolts, used gaskets and oil seals, and don't 
overlook our outstanding selection used timing belts!  Why we even have 
used grease!  The list is Virtually too big to list!

And for you procrastinators out there, why not sign up for our long term 
rental program with delayed payment?  There is just no other deal like 
this on Earth.  What are you waiting for?

No order is too big or too small for the Virtual Used Part Rental Program 
and we have a satisfaction guaranteed policy for all of our Virtual 
customers.  

What's more, since all our stock is Virtual, you pay virtually nothing!

Never before has such a steal been offered to the public and this one is 
simply too good to be true!  Don't wait, get your order in today and 
avoid the holiday rush.

Void where prohibited.
