Bob and Bill,
           I took a look at my wastegate last night and I can now give you
some better information about how to tell if the wastegate is shimmed. If
you look at a stock wastegate, it will have a gasket between the bottom of
the wastegate diaphram and the wastegate itself. If you look at a shimmed
wastegate, it will look like it has two or three gaskets between the
diaphram and the wastegate (normally two shims and one gasket).  To remove
or install shims from the wastegate, the entire wastegate assembly must be
removed from the car, and the diaphram removed from the wastegate. This
requires removing the bolts which attach the diaphram to the wastegate
body. The stem that attaches the gate itself to the diaphram is threaded
and screws into the diaphram. Once the bolts are removed, you should be
able to unscrew the diaphram from the wastegate and remove or install shims
as necessary.  Shimming the wastegate is something that was done with a lot
of the early performance chip kits. There are a few kit still out there
that have you shim the wastegate but, most of the ones now have everything
controlled by the chip. Also, I believe most of the new kits are getting
away from drilling the cycling valve as well.
