yep- the dealers are like porcupines..pricks on the outside!  it is a 
shame but i have to give praise to the p-car dealer in San Antonio 
when they did my belts etc. not only did they steam the engine as 
they promised but they cleaned the interior, even the carpets for 
free...not to mention i was on vacation (took the trip to go to the 
dealer 3+hrs.) and i had to have the car back the next day by 
5:00p.m.  so i asked about a rental car, their response was we have a 
95 993 in the back you can take if we are not finished by 
5:00....they said this to a 19yr old male, who lives 3+hrs. away who 
they knew could not come back for at least 1 week....after i 
explained it all to him he said,"son you bought the best and it is 
only proper that while it is in my shop you should retain the 
best..."  the shop manager and parts manager are both PCA members and 
one is the chair of the region i believe...anyhow after rambling on i 
know we are always talking about how bad they are but this one was 
very good and i wont go anywhere else!!

<< Greetings,
  In reference to Bob's tire problems in message number 45 dated January 17,
1998 posting in PorscheFans does this out of round condition occur on new
tires?
 Many Porsche owners, like myself, look for the best deals on products to
enhance our cars without sacrificing anything. 
  Is it then safe to say that although Tire Rack does have the best prices,
are there tires second rate or blems? >>

All,
I had my tires remounted and balanced today.  Smooth as glass up to 115mph
(ran out of road).  It turns out that the high spot on the rim and the high
spot on the tire have to be mounted opposit each other.  I talked to Tire Rack
on Friday, and the said to try it, and I really didn't have time to keep the
list updated with every little new piece of info that I got.

Bottom line is on the tires, a good name brand tire will be the same where
ever you get it basically.  I had never even heard of the "highspot" matching
thing until this incident.  There's a good explaination on Tire Rack's web
page.

blk/blk (and smooth again!)
