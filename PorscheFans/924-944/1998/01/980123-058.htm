It is made of the same material as the 2" shoulder harness, and has a clamp
for adjustment.  You slip it over the headrest and tighten it at the height
you desire.  There are two "loops" sewn to it, positioned so that once
installed, one loop will end up over each shoulder.  You simply feed the
shoulder straps thru the loops.  The loops also prevent the shoulder
harness straps from falling down on the floor and help to keep them up on
your shoulders where they belong.

Bill, since I have your fax number, I will send you a picture.  If anyone
else would like to see what it looks like, provide me with your fax number.
