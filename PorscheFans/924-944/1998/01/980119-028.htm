This sounds a lot like either a loose relay or the stupid air flow sensor
connector not making proper contact.  You have to use a good contact cleaner
on the following connections:

- cycling valve connector
- air flow sensor
- idle control servo (or whatever it's called)
- throttle position sensor

If you get the problem again, wiggle the connector near the airbox, see
if the problem goes away, if it does, you know for sure it's just a 
dirty contact.  This seems to be VERY common on 89 951's for some reason.

On another note, I tried something new yesterday that was a BLAST.  I
went snowboarding.  If you like turbo Porsches, you've got to try
snowboarding, it's like hitting boost down a steep hill in 4th gear,
similar rush, just no police to worry about :)  Definitely, a good
replacement for racing during the winter months!

Someone mentioned yesterday what the normal procedure is for selling
stuff on the net through list friends.  I've sold or bought over $20,000
in parts and products through the net and have found the following to
work best:

- buyer sends US money order or cheque BEFORE seller ships parts
- buyer agrees to pay 1/2 of shipping cost
- seller should cash cheque or MO before sending parts
- seller should NOT delay shipment after MO or cheque has been cashed
- seller should contact UPS to make sure that all documentation is
  accurate when sending parts across the border
- seller should give a 1-day TOTAL SATISFACTION return policy.  By this I
  mean that if the buyer gets the package and is not happy, they should be
  able to return it immediately for a full refund.  I know it sounds harsh,
  but if someone is not happy with what they got, then the seller has not
  been clear as to what the buyer was getting, right?

I recently sold two items to list members, wheels to Clark Archer and tires
to Barry Lenoble.  I know that Clark has gotten the wheels and I'm pretty
sure he is very happy with them and Barry should be getting the tires soon.
Both parties went with the procedures above and I think they are happy and
I'm happy.  Another good business transaction through the web!
