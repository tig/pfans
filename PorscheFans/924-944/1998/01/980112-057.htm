I have replaced both of mine on my 89 Turbo.  I sent my originals in to 
be repaired so I would have the OEM M030 bushings when they returned 2 
days later.

Dynamic European Technologies did mine for $150 each (713 661-2780).  
They are warranted for 3 years street or track.

I have used them for 9 months with no problems.  I understand they are 
the company that Tweeks uses for their $250 arms.

I have talked to both Zim's and Dynamic European Technologies (DET) and 
asked them about each other's products.  Apparently, neither have 
anything nice to say about the other.  DET did say that he has reworked 
many Zim's arms and claims that Zim's are not as good.

I make no claims for or against that remark, but I can say I was happy 
with the service.  I think, in all fairness, Zim's has a very good 
reputation and I was treated well by both companies.

Also, in a conversation with Fabcar, they do not recommend their arms for 
street use due to the lack of a boot on the ball joint.  I think one 
could be fashioned, but you could buy a large number of DET arms for the 
price of one Fabcar arm.

Good luck with your choice.
