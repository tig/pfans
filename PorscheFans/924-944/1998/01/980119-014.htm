Hi everyone,

i am in the process of painting my 1980 924 Porsche. I am finished 
sanding and probably prime it tomorrow. I know its kinda late to be 
making a decision, but I live out here in redneck ville, and heres the 
scenario , I walk into local parts store I tell them i am looking for 
some pretty good paint. I wanted a base paint and a clear coat thingy. 
So I tell him i would like to see all the shades of red he carries. He 
then hands me two books on tractor paint. :(  I have the choice of "John 
Deer Green"  or "Redneck Red" .  I would like to have a decent looking 
car so i decided to take my business elsewhere. Unfortunately i havent 
been able to find that special "PORSCHE RED" i am looking for 
Does anyone know where i can find some decent color samples? My next 
step is going to find the closest dealer ( 2-3 hours away :( ) Hopefully 
they can tell me something ? 

thx 
danl
