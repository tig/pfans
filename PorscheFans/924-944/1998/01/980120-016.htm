Don't feel bad. I did the same thing auto-xing, except I didnt' meet any =
unmoveable objects. When the 944 slides, it S-L-I-D-E-S, and it seems =
usually on all 4's. Wet pavement is exceptionally dangerous on this car =
due to the low weight and wide tires. Weight on the tires is not =
concentrated enough to get through the water to the pavement.
My experience with this car, (which I'm sure I'll hear about) has ben =
that when the back wheels go, it's time to back off the throttle, cause =
steering into the slide seems to help the front end go as well. Coming =
out of a left hander (too hot), I had the back end come out, stayed on =
the throttle, steered into it and sure as all get out, went into an all =
wheel slide. When this strategy didn't work, I went for the =
unconventional approach- Backed off the throttle and, against better =
judgement, let go of the steering. To my surprise and delight, the =
steering wheel snapped to the straight ahead position, the rears caught, =
and I was back in control (although 45 degrees from the course). Back on =
the throttle, got thru the cones and finished without an OFC. (sometimes =
it pays to go to church) I watched a 97 Camaro and a 97 Corvette come =
out of the same turn and immediately do 180's. Something to be said for =
50-50 weight distribution.
