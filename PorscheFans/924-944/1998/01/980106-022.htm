No need to "lift the motor out of the car" to replace motor mounts.  It
is a simple job and can be done fairly easily if done properly.  It
takes me about 30 min. to do one or about 45 min. to do both if I am
organized and have the tools together (but I have done quite a few).

With the front of the car on jack stands:

Place a jack stand underneath the bell housing.
 
Removing the front wheels is not necessary, but is helpful.

On a NA car, remove the air cleaner/air flow meter assembly for easy
access to the left motor mount upper bolts. (only do this if you have a
long enough extension to get a socket on top of the mounting
bolts...otherwise, just access the left bolts from underneath the car.

From underneath, remove the belly pan if it is still there.

Remove the front (12mm bolts, 19mm socket) and rear (10mm bolts, 17mm
socket) mounting bolts of the lower a-arms (the rear mount should be
easy to reinstall at the same location by looking at the residue
buildup--mark with tape if unsure).
 
Remove the lower motor mount nuts (10mm nuts, 17mm socket size).

Remove the bolts (8mm bolts, 13mm socket) holding the upper sway bar
brackets to the chassis.

Remove the right mount heat shield (6mm bolts, 10mm socket).

With a 1/4" drive flex head rachet and a 13mm socket, or a short 13mm
wrench, remove the 8mm upper mounting bolts for the motor mounts.  If
the mounts are of the pre 968 style (full rubber mount), hold the bottom
8mm nut (13 wrench size).  A little WD-40 might ease removal of some of
the bolts.  Some of the bolts might be very tight.  Flex head rachets
are very useful in tight quarters.

Loosen all four of the 12mm (19mm socket) mounting bolts for the
aluminum crossmember, almost to the point of removal (actually, I remove
them one at a time, and then reinstall them about two turns) to allow
the crossmember to drop down. 

With a pry bar, pickup on one side of the engine enough to slide the
mounts out (do one side at a time..pull out a mount, install the new
one...then do the other side).  You will find that you have to twist
them in slightly...but if you got the old one out, you can get the new
one in).

Before installing the new mounts, I always tap the holes of the new
mounts.  If you don't have a tap, just screw in the bolt to be sure that
the threads are clean.  If you did not already have the newer style
mount, you will need shorter mounting bolts (42mm shank, or 1 3/4").

The thick washers formerly used have been discontinued due to the
thicker mounting surface of the new mount. Use a small flat washer
instead.

A little anti-seize put on the threads never hurts.

Installation is the reverse. Get all upper mounting bolts installed
before you tighten any of them to allow room for a little "wiggle" when
installing everything.  Pry bars can come in handy.

We do not find it necessary to loosen the steering knuckle to the rack
bolt.

Part numbers...951.375.042.04  motor mount (left and right)
               900.378.034.02  (4) mounting bolts (there is also
a                                     shorter bolt..900.378.024.02 which
is                                   38mm long, but the longer one
should do                                 fine)
                N 015 401 3    (4) washers
   
Torque specs:
8mm nuts and bolts..17 ft. lbs.
10mm nuts and bolts..32 ft. lbs
12mm nuts and bolts..control arm to crossmember..48 ft. lbs.
                     crossmember to body.........62 ft. lbs.

I hope this helps those of you who are doing it yourself.

Happy wrenching...Don Istook
