One possible problem that many owners get into is the use of incorrect 
coolant.  Porsche specifies a phosphate free mixture.  If a coolant that 
contains phosphates is introduced, a chemical reaction with the aluminum 
may result and produce a sludge.  This is sort of analogous to high 
cholesterol in humans.

I drained my coolant and found this same silver sludge lurking in the oil 
cooling housing on the passenger side of the engine.  I also found it 
collecting in any low flow areas within the coolant system.  

My next project is replacement of the water pump and I will inspect that 
area when I get the pump out.

Also, the series I 944 was noted for running a little hot, but your case 
sounds like a low flow.
