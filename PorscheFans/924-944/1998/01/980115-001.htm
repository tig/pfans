Yeah, the one the prior owner decided he needed more than you did, and
didn't include with the car? The one whose lacking of present existence
(interesting verb tense) made you walk with your spare tire to the gas
station to fill it up? That one? You fix it simply by praying you never
get a flat. <g>

In all seriousness, grab your volt meter and check for juice at the
terminals to the motor while it's hooked up to the battery and
theoretically on. <fzzzap!>  If there is voltage, and it's not running,
then you've got a bad motor. If that's not it, just trace the electrics
backwards.
