You are mixing apples and pomegranites.    Fix your mixture problem and 
your plugs will clean up.   I would first suspect the head temperature
sensor is telling your engine that the temperature is colder than it really
is, and the DME reacts with a richer mixture.    NO connection to spark.
None.   Nada.

If anyone has a line on a good 968 Transaxle w/ factory LSD please let me
know.  I will also need the torque tube and shift linkage.

Thanks,

Thanks in advance for any responses I receive...

Does anyone know anything about non stock cams for an '86 951?

I am looking for someone who can help with brake proportioning on an '86 951
w/ a M030 suspension setup from a 968 and S4 calipers up front w/ the stock
front calipers moved to the rear.

I am wondering of the stock rear shock perches can support a coil-over
suspension setup.  Does anyone have any experience with a rear suspension that
does not use torsion bars on the 951?  Or is the best option to upgrade to the
23 mm gun drilled torsion bars?

Thanks again,

John
