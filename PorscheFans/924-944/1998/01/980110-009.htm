I am unfamiliar with the 690 but it sounds like there is a substantial 
difference in the tires.  The SZ50s work great in the wet.  Well enough, in 
fact, that I use them on the track as my wet tires.  At Pocono 
International, on a drizzly day, my lap times with the SZ50s and it being 
my first time at the track, were within 2-3 seconds of the fastest 993 
racecar, a Peter Dawe setup that his son Jason was driving.  Certainly I 
would like to take all the credit for my driving skills but the SZ50s, 
IMHO, are very predictable in the wet.
