I have read all the files lately on pools of water in the passenger side of
the car, But there is no battery on the drivers side.

I have had the seat out and the carpets pulled back with someone holding
the garden hose on the car. And still could not find out where the water is
coming in. 

The sunroof drains appear to be doing their job.

Any suggestions.

I think you'll find that the use of race seats makes a HUGE difference in car
control and safety.  A few years ago I went to a Sparco with a five point
harness and discovered that the primary purpose of the steering wheel was to
control direction rather than to use as a grab handle.
