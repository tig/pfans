1.  I have heard of a big bore kit, which includes steel cylinder sleeves to
make a 2.5 into a 2.7.  Anyone with any experience with this?
2.  Any difference between an '86na engine and an '87na?  Considering a used
86 engine rather than the 87 rebuild.
3.  Will turbo brakes and suspension parts bolt onto a non-turbo?  Any gain
from using a turbo muffler on a non-turbo?

Any help is appreciated.

For Roz McCarthy, having touble with drunken teenagers abusing your P-car, it
would be safe to assume you are dealing with idiots, so when you have a
problem do what the madison avenue advertising types do over here, CHANGE THE
NAME. We used to have a lawn care company here called Chemlawn, but people
were uncomfortable with what the company might be spraying on the lawn, so now
the company is called True Green. My point is this - find a sign making shop
that can print on that magnetic sheet stock that is used for stick-on-the-door
type advertising over here, if you can find it, and make the color match your
car. Then go get the necessary decals from some pedantic type car, (Ford,
Fiat, I don't know, whatever would work) Make them to fit over the porshce
labels. Leave them on there whenever you want, you can always take them off
when in the civilized world, and I bet the idiots will not even know what it
is. Excepting of course, the possibility of repeat customers, who might be on
to you. It would also get lots of interesting responses from passers by, like
"is that really a fiat"? Good luck. I suppose there is always the motion
sensing alarm too, but these can be more trouble than they are worth.
