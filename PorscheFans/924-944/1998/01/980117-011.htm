      I would like to thank the person that provide the useful 
information on how to cool the clutch. What I would like to ask if it is 
really save at lets say, 120 km\h in rain. I believe water WILL find its 
way to the clutch, and we all know what this means!
      Also on this note, I´d like to inquire about the infamous air 
filter pick-up, the hydrolock nightmares that some 944 driver have 
experienced, has anyone thought up something. I am planning on drilling 
a few holes on the tube where the bend is. And finally is the 
positioning of the air pick-up of any intelligence, would it not be more 
logical in placing it towards the front of the car, thus taking 
advantage of some of the ram air effect? Thanks.
