Was crossing the Golden Gate bridge in fourth gear this evening when I felt
severe hesitation; I de-clutched and attempted to "clear its throat" by
blipping the throttle, but the hesitation persisted. A few more seconds of
poor running and then it's dead.

After verifying that the timing belt was intact, I tried to start it a few
more times with no success. I called my GF (don't ask which version--I lost
count some time ago) and asked her to come jump-start it. Amazingly, it
starts right up and idles perfectly. I disconnect the jumper cables and let
it idle for about ten minutes, and then severe hesitation/misfires (still
at idle) resumes.

So, I put it on a flatbed and brought it home. Sometimes it'll start and
run for a period of time, but then starts hesitating and dies--like it's
starved for fuel. After it dies, it usually won't start for at least ten or
twenty minutes. I checked the distributor, all accessible electrical
connections, and the DME (no water).

Any ideas or suggestions would be most appreciated.

Thanks,

-Jeff
