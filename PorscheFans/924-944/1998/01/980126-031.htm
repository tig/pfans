I'm not sure about the 84, but a pal of mine has an 85 944
which came with a Monterey.  My 86 also came with a Monterey.
Believe it or not, it was a $600+ option on the window sticker!
(This is not the 10 speaker option - just the four 4x6"
whizzer cone speakers.)  The 87 brochure shows a different
stock radio.

After my original Monterey was stolen, I had to go through
two more to get one that worked.  My pal with the 85 has
also gone through two or three of them.  In all cases there
have been a lot of mechanical problems - finicky cassette
mechanisms, pushbutton failures, heat-sensitivity, etc.

My opinion?  (Since you didn't ask...)  Unless you really
really really want the stock radio, you can buy a much
better radio for less money than a rebuilt Blau.
If you want to be European about it, both Blau and Becker
have modern aftermarket lines.  A Becker stereo is what comes
in the new Porsches.  The Boxster also has a Nokia amp - I
don't know if the 911 has an amp.  Or what kind of speakers
either use (but the speakers need to be changed - they are
definately not MBQuarts...)

I do have a Monterey manual - if anyone is curious about
any specs or operational details.
