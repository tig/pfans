Michel,

I appreciate your comments on Tire Rack and the Blizzaks. I've heard the
same think about the Nokian HAKKAPELIITTA's being better for snow and for
ice racing. I think it was Road and Track who did a comparison up in
Houghton, MI a few years back that included the Hak's and the Blizzaks and
in that test the Haks were better in deep snow but that the Blizzaks were
much better on ice. I chose the Blizzaks because I live and drive primarily
in urban areas and on interstates where ice is both more common and
certainly more treaterous than snow. For ice racing and deep snow, I agree
the Hakkapeliitta's seem to be recognized as best.

I was wondering, though, if Hakkapeliitta's newer tires like the Hakka 1
incorporated any of the Blizzak's multi-cell technology or micro sipes or
perhaps another new technology that now makes them the all-around best
winter tire? I found information at http://www.snowtyres.com/html/home.html
if you're interested in more info on the Hak's. This web page talked about
next generation but not a lot of specifics. It was also interesting to see
the other two Hakkapeliitta's (the NRS & NRW) which seem to lean to a middle
ground in that they are designed to be better suited to the dry, have higher
speed ratings, and are sized for luxury cars.

It sounds like you're pleased with the Pirelli Winter Ice tires. Given their
name it seems they might use similar technology to the Blizzak? How are they
in the dry? Would you buy another set? Have you heard anything about any of
the other newer winter tires? I had a set of Pirelli Winter S2's on my Audi
5000 in the late 80's but they were EXTREMELY noisy and I wasn't nearly as
impressed with their performance as the Blizzaks.
