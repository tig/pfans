I picked up my new 924 yesterday, and drove it about 500km. When I started
the car it ran rough, but I thought it would get better when it got warm.
Wrong. It turned out one of the spark plugs were shot, so the car only ran
on three cylinders. For 500km! I drove from Oslo to Stavanger (Norway),
stopping by every single gas station on the way, but nobody knew how to
change spark plugs (OK, so I'm not the best mechanic in the world, but they
should know). Anyway, I replaced the spark plugs today, and that cleared
things up a bit. But I think something is wrong. When I drive, I hear a
ticking sound. It's a distinct "tic-tic-tic-tic" sound whose frequency
follows RPMs. OK, I know it isn't healthy driving 500km on three cylinders,
but I had no choice. Is something destroyed? It doesn't sound like a valve.

Anyway, that's not the only problem. On the way the driving lights went out.
I can use the high beams, but I can't get them to lock. If I want to have
any lights at all I have to keep pulling the lever to get the high beams. If
I let go of the lever, the lights disappear. It seems unlikely that both
bulbs would go at a time (I even checked one of them and it was OK), so what
could it be? Fuses are OK.

While trying to find out what was wrong with the front lights, I managed to
destroy the left rear light. That is, it won't come on. I replaced the bulb,
and it's OK. Loose wire? If so, where on earth do I look? I tried getting
the fuse and relay panel off, but it won't move because all the wires seem
so short. Surely I don't have to pull out all the wires and plugs from
behind the panel before I can get it out?
