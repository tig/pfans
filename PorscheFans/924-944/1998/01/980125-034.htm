Simon,
Check the resistance of the pump itself by connecting your multimeter to the
terminals of the pump.  The pump should have very little resistance if the
motor is good--approximately 20 ohms.  Could it be bad out of the box?  Have
you checked the pump out of the car (i.e., using clean tubing only) to see
if it pumps on 12 v?  The windshield (windscreen) washer pump for 924, 944,
and 928 are all the same from 1977-87.  These pumps are generally quite
reliable.  Could it be that the screen filters, one way valves, or tubing
connectors are clogged?  Have you tried squirting water by hand or blowing
air to see if the system is functional?

Hello all

Is the washer pump on the 924 a standard type? I ask because I was told that
my pump is broken and need to get a new one, £30 plus VAT from a dealer so I
bought a universal pump from my local shop today but when fitting it, the
pump didn't work at all.I connected a multimeter to the terminals and when
the lever was pulled I measured 12 volts coming out.

Regards.

Simon Moore
