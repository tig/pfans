Subject: Strange Noise From Cruise Control?

My 1987 944S has recently been making strange noises intermittently as I back
out of the driveway. 

..  I think I
have narrowed it down to what I have always believed to be the servo for the
cruise control. The unit I speak of sits on top of the passenger side fender
well and has a throttle cable attached to it.  Please correct me if the unit
that I speak of is not the servo for the cruise.
