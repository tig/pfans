Thanks for the info. It is nice to know how these rules are applied in
practice!

Hmm. Where/how did you mount the anti-sub belt(s)?

I've tried it before and the harnesses will slip unless I cross them behind
the seat. It certainly feels solid that way, though its probably not
permissible for racing.

I dunno about the stock seats not being safe enough - they've been
crash-tested, TuV-tested, are constructed with fire-retardent materials, etc.

I'd be interested in finding out how you're going to mount the Kirkey. My
impression was that Aluminium seats like the Kirkey had to be mounted at
the seatback as well as the seat bottom???
