I did some more research on a couple of 944 FAQs and I think Hal Rumenapp was
correct in his assessment that the CV joints need to be regrease. According to
the FAQs, when the joints start to fail or need to be regreased the will begin
binding under load. 

As soon as I figure out how to get the car in my driveway (too steep), I'll
let everyone know what I found.
