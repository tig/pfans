For Alyn Fendley:

     As for your rear hatch leaking, perhaps if you would pull the snaps
holding the rear compartment carpetting and inspect just below the rear
lip of the hatch openning, take a look at the receptacles/holes of where
your hatch pins go into and catch. Within these holes, the bottom of the
catches should have a small plastic square "funnel" that catches the
rain water from the catch wells and funnels into the small white tubes
that go on downwards to the bottom of the car for final expulsion to the
outside of the body. Maybe the tubes aren't seated firmly to the catch
well funnels. Just offering a suggestion....... Hope this might be of
some use to you.


For Rich Freitas:


     Strange that you should mention about the fly wheel sensors. My '83
944na was purchased w/ a bizzare problem. The engine would turn over but
not fire up at all if cold. It would start, however, if you shot a
squirt of starting fluid or ether into the throttle body openning (done
by unscrewing the clamp holding the air intake rubber boot and G E N T L
Y working it off the throttle body aperature lip) and then it would fire
up. Then once the engine was warmed up, it would start up happily.
During rain, fog or moist/humid days, forget it. It refused to start
regardless. During the troubleshooting process, I replaced my DME brain
box, inspected all of my vacuum lines, checked the fuel line pressure in
the rail, and the air flow sensor w/ a multimeter. No joy. Found out
that during the times when she won't fire up, the ignition coil wasn't
getting the breaking of the voltage to time the firing of the cylinders.
Once the ignition key was turned on, the voltage came on and remained
constant throughout turning over the engine. I used the tachometer as an
indicator if the engine would fire up or not: during the times it won't
-- the tachometer would flicker one time initially to indicate that the
voltage to the coil did come on but no breaking pulses..... during the
times when I knew it would fire up -- the tachometer needle would
fluctuate fm 0 through 800 rpm to indicate that the coil was getting the
breaking pulses. Similar responses using a multimeter across the
terminals of the ignition coil.  Anyway, I don't know what caused the
flywheel sensors to fail but my dad and I determined that this was the
guilty culprit. Replacement of these sensors did the trick. I wasn't
there at my dad's shop during the R/R session but I can tell you that he
did say that it was extreme hell to get to and remove for anyone with
fat hands/fingers, even with universal joints and extensions on your
rachet. Just my experience.


For Chuck in Pensacola:


       I swapped out my 7" sealed beam headlamps with the Autopal H4
headlamps found at the back page (pg 108) of the order form of the black
covered AutoAtlanta catalog. These lamps came with the H4 halogen bulbs
and the small tungsten bulbs for the tiny glowing effect of built-in
parking lamps. I ran a pair of wires and spliced them into my parking
light wires. This way, when the headlights are in pop-up mode but
switched back from headlights to parking lights, the headlamps softly
glow via the small tungsten bulb.......just like the way the European H4
lamps in the Mercedes-Benz or other genuine euro-spec vehicles do. I
think they're cool looking and for only $20 for the whole package, can't
go wrong.......cheaper than the Bosch or Hella H4 7" conversions. They
fit into the same trim retainer rings for the sealed beam lamps and the
H4 bulbs plug directly into the factory stock harness. The only thing
you need is a Phillips screwdriver to remove the front headlamp door and
to remove the trim retainer ring holding the old lamps.

For the list:

        What I'd like to do is to upgrade fm the 55/60 watt bulbs to the
80/100 watt H4 bulbs....and even upgrading my driving lamps fm the 55w
H3 bulbs to the 100w H3 bulbs......mmmmm maybe adding the Hella rear fog
lamp to the underskirt of the bumper for that Eurospec look. The problem
is that I don't want to overload my wiring harness loom. All of these
catalogs say to add a relay. OK, now I have the relay Bosch heavy-duty
type, where in the wiring do I install it for the headlights? Can I run
the stock driving lamps on the 100w H3 bulbs without using a relay and
not cause a heavy amperage draw? Probably not, figured I'd ask anyway.
TIA
