Well, gang, I just got my shipment, and I have to say they look FANTASTIC!!
We all owe Jay a great big "THANK YOU" for taking on this project and
seeing it thru to its really nice looking finish.

So, I guess you will be able to recognize me, after all, if you make it to
the Chicago Auto Show next month.

Thanks again, Jay, you did a wonderful job.
