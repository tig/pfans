Dave, my car had exactly the same symptoms as yours and replacing the
clutch did cure it.  My guess as to why the rattling noise goes away when
you replace the clutch has to do with the splined center tube of the clutch
disk (that engages the end of the drive shaft).   Once the rubber has been
sheared and disbonded from the central tube in the clutch disk, the tube is
free to move a bit; enough to produce an audible rattle I think.  As for
this rattle showing up loudest when decelerating from high rpms, I am
guessing that this has to do with the three metal 'ears' in the clutch disk
assembly that allow the disk to continue functioning (in a "limp home" mode
sort of way), provided the rubber chunks do not screw up pressure plate
operation.  When you are accelerating, these ears are loaded up and
transmitting the torque and as such the central tube is not free to rattle.
 On deceleration, while there is engine braking occurring, the loading on
the ears is probably much less and this lets the tube rattle (the higher
rpms may also aggravate this).  

P.S. - I held onto the old pressure plate too, in case I ever go club
racing.....
