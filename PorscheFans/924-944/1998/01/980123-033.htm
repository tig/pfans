When I bought my 1986 944 Turbo sometime ago by some stupid mistake i
managed to forget to see if the sunroof worked. Well, it doesn't. I checked
to see if the switch for it was even connected and it was but when i looked
in the fuse box for the relay there was none there. And to make matters
worse there wasn't even anything there for a relay to plug into. Now I'm
just assuming that the fuse box was replaced with one from a none sunroof
car at some point in time and that is why there is no plug for the relay.
Is that correct? If it is is there anyway I can get all the wiring or
whatever needed to install the relay? If I do need to buy a new fuse box,
which I don't want to have to deal with, is there anyway to manually open
the sunroof? Any other suggestions would also be appreciated. thanks. Joe
