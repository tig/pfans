All,
A bit of discussion has gone back and forth regarding installing 968
Transmissions in earlier cars.  From what I can tell, there's some
modification required around the torque tube/ bell housing area.

Does anybody know (or have a POC who may know) exactly what is reqiured other
than the 968 Transmission and the labor required to conduct any modifications?

Someone once said "the 968 6th gear is like an extra highway gear" which
prompted me to think using this transmission with lower ring and pinion would
be the way to go.  Looking at the gearing, it seems that the 6 speeds are
spread out over the same speed range as the 5 speed just geared a hair lower.
 
Any info greatly appreciated.
