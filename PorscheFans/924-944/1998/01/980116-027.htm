Hello Lawrence,

My opinion:
Jump in and drive. But gently, until the engine reached normal
operating temperature. Idling is not good for the engine, it will
take too long to warm up because there is no load on it. You're
best off just driving, but again, gently. I try not to exceed
3000 rpm until the water temp comes up, then I won't go above
4K until everything has warmed up. 

Note that other parts of the car have to warm up too. The suspension
(shocks), brakes, transaxle, etc. all need some time to warm up.
Having the engine idle does nothing for those components.
