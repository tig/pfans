You guys are too good.  I received about 40 answers.  The only answer
that was way, way, way off base was one about having a.....small
chicken?? in the cooling system obstructing the flow (I have found a
dead mouse in one before when we pulled the cylinder head off for
overheating).  Now, was that a German chicken that got in there from the
factory, or just one that wanted to say that he had ...been IN...a
Porsche???? 

The specific answer was a loose impeller on the shaft.  This can be a
problem more with the late cars with the plastic impellered water pump.

A common answer was a bad radiator cap...this will generally lead to
overheating at idle, but not when driving.

Some of the respondents with specific correct answers (not just that the
pump is bad, but that the inpeller was bad) were:
Terry Yancey, Joe Mitchell, Mitch Tracy, Keven Gross, Keith Blocker,
Rich, Ruudje, and probably others.  

The first correct answer was by Dave C, which came in almost immediately
I got about 6 answers within about 30 min after posting the
question....(some of you guys have WAYYY too much time on your hands).

The car that we had the problem with was an extremely nice low mileage
1991 944S2 that had had a new t-stat installed about 3mos. ago for
overheating.  When it came back in for overheating again, I went to
great lengths to be sure that the new t-stat had not failed.  

My reason for some of the postings is to show that sometimes there are
problems that you cannot see, but if you analyze all of the related
functions of what is working properly, you can narrrow down the
solution.

In that case, when the engine was rev'd up, the freewheeling impeller
would start to spin, and then push coolant through, enough for the
engine to cool ok.  One clue...with the car sitting still and no airflow
over the radiators and the fans not on and a hot engine, reving over
3,000RPM would bring the coolant temp. down.  Anything under that the
temp. would immediately go up.

No answers were totally incorrect (except for the chicken).  The
specifice answer was a loose impeller on the water pump shaft.

If anyone has a repair problem, e-mail me direct, or call me at
(817)332-6547.  With so much chit-chat going onto the list about non
related repair problems, I don't have time to sort through 50 to 70
e-mails each day that are about someone's trip to their grandmother,
etc.  I may not have your specific answer, but maybe I can steer you in
the right direction.
