Well, there it is, I finally got it out there, after suffering through major
downtime on my computer _and_ my car!

For those who might be interested, the totals at publication time included
38 registered 924 's, 15 931 's, including 6 automatic 924 's and a small
handful of the early "S" models - meaning with the M471 Sport
Suspension package, not to be confused with the 944-powered 924S.

I just came across a website while surfing today which hosted a lot of
VW hop-up and dune-buggy stuff. The most interesting thing I saw was
the rear disc brake conversion for Beetles - 924's with 4-lug suspension
have Super-Beetle rear drums. Has anyone out there converted to discs
this way, as opposed to going to the later 5-lug 944 suspension?
Comments? (I have no idea what the pricing on the kit is, they don't seem
to publish that info on their website). The address is:

(CB Performance)

They look to be pretty well kitted out in terms of development and
engineering facilities. As always, I have no prior knowledge of or
involvement with this company, just though someone out there might be
interested...
