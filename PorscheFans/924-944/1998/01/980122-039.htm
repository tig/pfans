I think it has been  discussed but it seems the 944 has much more inherent recovery from  oversteer than other cars, which is basically what your saying as  well. If I had been anticipating the curve of course there would have  been no oversteer so I am very glad the car corrects well.


Joe,

Actually I wasn't saying that the car corrects well, what I was saying
is that it corrects differently than american cars.  I think it's
trickier actually than some of the so called sports cars America
builds.  It is harder to not over correct, in my very, oh so humble,
possibly misguided opinion.  BUT, having practiced, and continuing to do
so, I feel that the car is somewhat more controllable for me now. 
Still, when it does decide to get sideways, it does so quickly and
without a whole ton of warning, and is a not terribly easy to get back
without doing the old '944 pendulum' (whoever coined that phrase last
week is now officially famous).  I do, however, take partial blame for
this as I've gone to 225's up front, which decreases understeer, but, I
would think, increases over steer.  And, I'm not running a $1200 set of
tires, and I'm not a professional racer, and I drive too damn fast,
and....I'll stop now before I decide to sell the car and buy a minivan. 
If I hadn't heard from so many of you about sideways 944's I'd blame it
completely on the Nitto tires not giving a ton of warning before letting
go.
