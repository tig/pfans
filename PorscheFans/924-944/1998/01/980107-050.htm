Hello P-Fans,

     I own an '87 951 that is in need of a battery.  With all this talk 
of Sears, I decided to drop by my local store to check things out.  The 
computer does not have a listing for the car, however, the book does.  
It states that the car calls for one of the International batteries.  
The one in particular puts out 650 CCAs.  Does anyone know the proper 
amount of Cold Cranking Amps (CCAs) required for our cars?

Thanks in advance,

Lee Weissman

<<The last issue of Excellence had an interesting but somewhat ambiguous
article on track techniques entitled "The Masters' Class", and I'm curious
to know what the more experienced drivers thought about it.  It was about
kind-of-experienced drivers getting tips from very experienced drivers at
Lime Rock, and the information seemed different from what rookies are
taught at Drivers Ed.  Like "turn earlier and brake later". Try this in
your first year and your instructor is likely to break something over your
helmet. Like the fire extinguisher.>>

I too was puzzled by this article.  We refer to "turn earlier and brake later"
as  early apexing out here in the Pac. NW, and it generally results in a ride
on the bumpy part of the outside of the track that lacks pavement and has
things like trees and tire walls in the way.  (Ask me how I know!)  I was
interested, however, in the comments to the effect that the driving line and
the racing line are different, with the latter being concerned more with
defending yourself against passing.
