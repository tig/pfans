A couple of months ago I was reporting a rough idle.  I searched and
searched and couldn't find the cause of it...and then it went away.  A
little more into the winter and it returned...and became worse and
finally the car would only start after I repeatedly cranked the engine 5
or 6 times at about 5 second intervals.  Eventually the darn thing quit
starting all together.  At this point I started checking ignition wires,
spark plus and distributor.  The rotor in the distributor was
practically cracked in half due to water freezing up in there.  My
question is this:  Is it possible that the initial rough idle could have
been caused by a cracked rotor?  It sounds kinda weird to me.  I took it
in to a mechanic and he checked out the engine and couldn't find
anything else that it might be.  I replaced the rotor and cap (what the
hell right?) and the car seems to be running smoothly....any input?
