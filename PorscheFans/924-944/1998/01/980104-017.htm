Sounds like a great system... to relieve you of the money in your wallet!

This is of course a meaningless test since spark plugs don't fire in free
air, but under high pressure in a combustion chamber.  I think you would
get the same demonstration results by using an old, worn out "normal"
carbon wire and a brand new "normal" carbon wire.

No spark plug cable will "increase" horsepower.  Let me make that clear.
None, zero, zip, nada.  The best that can be expected is that the cable
will deliver most of the energy that the system puts out.  You can't get
more power, or higher than stock voltage by changing wires.  All you can
do is try to minimize the losses that all wires have.  That's why the
newest systems don't use wires at all.  Each plug has its own remote coil
system that attaches directly to each spark plug.

My advice would be to return these gimmicky wires and get some high
quality normal wires.

Hello P-Fans,

	Check your heater control valve. When the valve leaks, coolant 
drips onto the hot exhaust/bell housing area, and evaporates. The heater
 control valves go bad all the time.

		
			Good Luck, DavidJalai@aol.com

Subject: Coolant loss

P-fans,

I have just had to top up my coolant level again and am getting concerned
about the cause of the loss. It required about a pint of coolant to top it
back up to the minimum level where it was about 1500 miles ago. 

I have inspected the car when it is cold and I cannot see any signs of
leakage. There is no oil in the water and no brown sludge on the oil filler
cap (where else should I look?). 

Could it still be the head gasket or is there some less obvious place I
should check for leakage.

TIA and a Happy New Year to all P-fans
