Hi Joel,

Tell us where the car is and we could probably round up a few Pfans to take
care of your (car's) needs for the upcoming period, then you wouldn't have
to worry about such things as "permanent" flat spots (only temporary ones)
and old gas.
BTW, everyone, check your local regions for events coming up during the
next couple of months.

If the above idea doesn't sit quite right with you, Joel, then you should
go into the PorscheFans 944 archives for October 30, 1997.  In it you will
find a posting from Qassim Moola with the subject "Winter Storage".  It
covers the basics for your situation.

BTW, if you are able to maneuver around enough, now is the time to take
care of any of those "little" problems that may have been annoying you in
the past.  They are what we in Porschedom call "Winter Projects".

Good luck with both your car and your leg.
