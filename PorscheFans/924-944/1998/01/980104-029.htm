I have just had to top up my coolant level again and am getting

top it
back up to the minimum level where it was about 1500 miles ago. 

I have inspected the car when it is cold and I cannot see any signs 
of
leakage. There is no oil in the water and no brown sludge on the oil 
filler
cap (where else should I look?).

I have had this problem twice once was expensive and once was cheap.  
The first time the cause was the head gasket.  The gasket did not 
start leaking inside the engine, it leaked outside, VERY slowly.  
With the hot engine typically evaporating the coolant before any hit 
the ground to leave a puddle or any easy to see evidence.  Look all 
around the head gasket for any sign of mineral deposits which could 
be associated with evaporating coolant.  It also did not leak when 
cold, it had to be hot before it would start seeping.  That's the bad 
news.

The second time was the heater valve on the back of the engine block. 
 A very slow leak that never left a puddle, but when we went to fix 
an oil leak in the rear of the block we found the valve had a slow 
leak.  Valve replaced.  Coolant loss stopped.  Cheap.

Good Luck

Rick

My 1987 944S has recently been making strange noises intermittently as I back
out of the driveway.  The noise starts as I release the clutch in reverse and
will continue even when I again depress the clutch in order to engage first
gear.  It sounds like the noise made by playing cards installed in the spokes
of a bicycle or of brush being dragged underneath the car.  It does not change
in frequency with the rpm's of the engine or with the cars speed.  I think I
have narrowed it down to what I have always believed to be the servo for the
cruise control. The unit I speak of sits on top of the passenger side fender
well and has a throttle cable attached to it.  Please correct me if the unit
that I speak of is not the servo for the cruise.  I have actually gotten out
of the car before when the noise was occurring and looked under the hood and
heard the noise from this component and felt it vibrating.  My cruise hasn't
worked in years but this noise has only recently started.  Can anyone suggest
what is going on here and what the fix would be?  I don't necessarily want the
cruise fixed, but this noise has got to go.  I would appreciate your ideas and
suggestions.

Hallelujah!!!  No more A's & O's and +='s !!!  

I switched to Micrisoft Word, instead of Claris word program. 
I also hit the "return" button at the end of each line.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.....

Hello, I am currently trying to troubleshoot a noise from the distributor cap
area of my 1987 944s. The noise is only present at startup, and disappears
after only 1-2 minutes of running. I had a major tune-up only 5,000 miles ago,
and it was replaced. At that time I replaced all belts, rollers, tensioners,
etc. I was told that the waterpump was in good condition and didnt need to be
replaced. Is it possible that this is not the distributor cap, but the water
pump I am hearing? I have tried several times to tell exactly where the sound
is coming from, but cant. The sound is like something rattling inside plastic.
I have taken the distributor cap off, and see no loose or broken parts.
Any help would be appreciated.

<<  I then went to another auto parts place that sells Exide batteries.  They
 didn't have one listed on their computer that would fit a 944. >>

I have an Exide Megatorque 75 in my 944 . . . . . it has a sticker on it that
says "41" on it and I assume that is the size.  Anyway, it fits just fine in
my battery tray.

When this one goes I'll probably get an Interstate as I've always had the best
results with them.

Hope this helps,
