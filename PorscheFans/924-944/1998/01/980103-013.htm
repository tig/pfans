        The Colorado law would be fine if it is written more specifically
to proscribe those jacked up vehicles with extremely high bumpers. Last
year, I was broadsided by a Toyota Land Cruiser, which hit the drivers side
door on my old '83 NA. Luckily, it was an optomatrist and family kind of
guy with the original wheels and tires, and he hit close enough to the door
reinforcement that all I had to show was kidney bruises. If it had been
jacked up, the guy would have come right through the window, and I would
not be writing this.
        Back in my misspent youth, I recall that many trucks in New York
State had heavy steel beams that were set at the height of a car bumper. I
think they were Jayne Mansfield beams, because of the famous movie star
that got guillotined when her car passed under the rear of an 18-wheeler.
Those of us with P-cars or other low-slung vehicles are particularly at
risk.
        That said, beware of well-intentioned government regulators.

Happy New Year,
