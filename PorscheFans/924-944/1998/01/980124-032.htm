Lou,

You should remove the old steering rack with the tie rods still 
attached, then remove them on the bench.  The tie rods have a collar 
which is peened (deformed) into a notch in the rack, and access with 
the rack installed is poor to non-existent.

You'll need something to help you remove the tie rod end's ball joint 
from the steering knuckle.  I use a ball joint puller tool, generally 
sold by a number of aftermarket places.  This is pretty much the only 
special tool needed.

Be sure to torque the tie rods into the rack on reinstallation.  A 
little red Loctite on the threads is a good idea, and be sure to peen 
the collar back on.  When you torque the tie rods to the rack, be 
absolutely sure to counterhold the rack, else you will damage it.  The 
best counterhold is to use an adjustable wrench across the flats of the 
rack, i.e., the moving serrated shaft.

Smear a light coat of moly grease on the extended ends of each side of 
the rack.

If the tie rods are high mileage, like 100K+ miles, or if they show 
excessive looseness, consider replacing them.  Consider replacing the 
four M8 bolts which attach the rack to the cross member.

Yes, you will need to realign the car.

Kevin
