Howdy,

I got the new Demon Tweeks catalogue yesterday from England.  With a whole
bunch of cool new karting stuff, I noticed they have quite a few items
for the 944/951's that may be of interest to you guys.

One item was a spherical bearing strut top in a cool anodized blue.  The
price was fairly reasonable, I think somewhere around US$180, looks like
a high quality unit.

The other items were mostly brake pads, rotors, bigger calipers, etc.  The
one item that did catch my attention is a compressor bypass valve specifically
made for the Porsche style "air-cutoff valve".  The unit is once again
anodized blue and looks pretty good.  I have no idea if it would be any
more efficient than the new 993 unit, probably not, but it looks cool and
costs twice as much ~$80.

Mark just got his 17" wheels on his car, they are the BBS-look factory
wheels available for the Boxster, I think they are called Sport Classic,
but without the rivets.  Does anyone want me to put pictures of how the
944T looks with those wheels on, on the net?

Farzaan.
