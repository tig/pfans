Front brakes on P-Cars are easy and quick, They take me about ½ hour in the
driveway while drinking a cup of coffee, I will try and remember the steps:

1.	Chock rear wheels
2.	Using a breaker bar crack the lug nuts on the front wheels
3.	Open hood - open the brake fluid tank and using an old Turkey baster
remove 2/3 of brake fluid leave a rag around the top of tank just in case of
overflow
4.	Jack up the left side (Driver side) and remove wheel and slide under
the car (Insert jack stand)
5.	Take a sip of coffee
6.	Get two large screwdrivers, a pair of channel locks, a punch (or 16p
nail), a can of brakeclean, some steel wool, hammer, and a small pliers and
new pads and set next to right wheel
7.	Move to right side and repeat jacking
8.	Sit down and remove right wheel (sip of coffee optional here)
9.	Remove the push cotter pins from the slider pins ( the slider pins
go through the brake pads)
10.	Using the punch (or nail) tap out the slider pins (Remember to catch
the anti-rattle spring - it looks like a "X")
11.	Using the two screwdrivers spread the pads apart ( work from the
tops of the pads 1st to get them started then insert blade between Pad and
Rotor)
12.	Push them until they are all the way back to flush with caliper
13.	Now pop out the old pads and insert new ones (if the fit is tight
reinsert old pad and push the piston back further) (You should look at the
piston boots and see that they are ok)
14.	Using steel wool clean the slider pins (get rid of junk and make
them smooth )
15.	Insert lower slider pin and bottom of the anti-rattle spring and tap
pin back in
16.	Using a screwdriver push down on top of anti-rattle spring and slide
in top pin and tap down
17.	Re-insert the push on cotter pins
18.	Slide back and spray caliper and area with brakeclean
19.	Get up have more coffee and move to other side
20.	Repeat steps 9-18
21.	Take a bathroom brake
22.	Now clean out the old fluid from the tank and whip out tank with
clean paper towels
23.	Refill tank with real good DOT 4 brake fluid (ATE Blue is my choice)
(DO NOT USE JUNK BRAKE FLUID or DOT 3!)
24.	Pump the brakes a few times to seat pads - 1st press or two you will
think you broke something because there will be no resistance.
25.	Here I normal bleed the front brakes with help from wife who I had
asked to bring me more coffee - is easy and quick
26.	Put the wheels back on and tighten lugs to 94#'s (good test of
brakes because wife has to hold the wheel with brake)
27.	Jack car off stands, remove stands and lower car
28.	Remove cock from rear wheels
29.	Start car and drive around block checking the brakes with a few soft
stops, and if ok a few hard ones.
30.	Depending on the pads you use you might want to do a few really hard
stops or drive at 50 and apply some brakes while you drive for a min or two
to get them hot
31.	Drive home and let the pads cool ½ hour (Or stop for a snack)
32.	Recheck the lugs and return tools to box, thank wife etc...


If at the track and rushed you might delete the coffee, wife, bathroom
breaks, and use gloves or channel locks to handle the pads and pins. (If you
spray the brakeclean on the pins it will cool them off fast.) OK prior to
1st turn make sure the brakes work (THIS IS REAL GOOD IDEA). I go through a
set of front pads every race weekend on my 914 and I always try and get a
few practice sessions out of the old pads while I learn the track. So I end
up changing the pads when every thing is hot, not real fun that way when you
try and pick up the old pads, and always in a rush.

	Regards,
	Yes I drink way too much coffee

	I need to replace the front brakes on my 968. I plan to purchase OEM

	rotors, pads, and wear sensors. Will I need anything else? Does
anyone 
	have any recommendations on preventing brake noise? Any tips for the
job? 
	Any suggestions would be appreciated.
