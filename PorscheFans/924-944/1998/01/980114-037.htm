Hi Barry,

I had the problem and fixed it by installing a thick (appx. 3/16") rubber
o-ring in the cap between the male threaded part and the sleeve. I found
the part in the o-ring cabinet at Pep Boys. While the diameter is just a
bit too large to grip the male threaded part (I had to use some gasket
sealer to keep it in place) it does seem to have cured the problem once
and for all.

Doug
