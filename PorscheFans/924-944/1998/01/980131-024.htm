Well, I've got confirmation on the running problem with my '77 924. The
problem was that either immediately after or shortly after starting the car
successfully, the car dies like I've just turned off the ignition! 

I suspected that the ignition switch was the cause due to the fact that
the guages were dieing also, at the same time. This was confirmed
when I put a spare switch in parallel to the broken circuit - I was able to
start the car and drive it without problem. As soon as I switched it off,
the problem returned.

As I found out at P3 from two other people who had this problem, the
cause is too many keys on your key ring! This puts too much side-loading
on the switch, causing it to fail prematurely. This was described to me
after asking at a vendor's display for the replacement part, as the two
people next to me proceeded to describe my problem to me!

Anyway, that's the cause and solution...
