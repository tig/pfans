Reading from the infamous PNA 000 147 A Parts and Technical Reference Catalog:

page 8/9
reference key #20
944 (1983) p/n 944 106 239 01 Upper Radiator Hose with Bleeder Hole.

reference key #20a
944 (1983-85/1) p/n 944 106 239 02 Upper Radiator Hose w/o Bleeder Hole.
944 (1985/2-88) p/n 944 106 239 07 Upper Radiator Hose
924S (1987-88) p/n 944 106 239 04 Upper Radiator Hose

So, technically speaking, you supplied the correct part number for 1984
model, and got the part for a newer version vehicle.  If you would like to
see the pages for real, supply me a fax number and I'll send you copies.
