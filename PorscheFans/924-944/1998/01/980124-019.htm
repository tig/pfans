Ok I guess the best way to work it would be to prep a list of items to be in
a video.  People would individually video tape the operation and then send
it to a central location.  That person would then dupe the video (and send
it back of course) compiling a larger video with everyones footage.  I would
agree that the cost of the video should be the cost of the tape plus
shipping and handling.

I will volunteer to be the central location.  I have a video camera too
(8mm) but I am very uncertain on the repairs end of things (that's why I
would like a video).  So if people want to send me footage of themselves and
their cars I'll compile them and start making copies for people.

I think we should have at least the following repairs/maintenance items:

Oil Change
Some sort of method of diagnosing problems
Brake Inspections
Changing brake pads/rotors
Water Pump replacement
Timing belt replacement
Motor mount replacement
Clutch replacement (if someone were REALLY ambitious)
Interior work like electric seat wiring or dash removal
Bleeding Brake lines

What other things should be included?  If you'd like to volunteer, I'm sure
the DIYers (Do-It-Yourselfers) would be very appreciative.  Like I said
before too; it would be nice to put a face with the names on the list.  Also
any track footage would be great.  I'm really itchy for nice weather and I
think a project like this would help pass the time.

Let me know if you care to contribute.

Before I start tearing my dash apart I thought I would ask the group if anyone
can suggest a source for my mystery noise, in an 87 924S. It sounds like a
relay is clicking at the same frequency of the engine rpms, and it sounds like
it is coming from the area of the relay/fuse box, above my left knee or
possibly behind the left part of the instruments. It is more noticeable at
idle and during acceleration, and is more noticeable when cold. I suppose it
could be something vibrating, but it feels more precise than that. I will have
to dig out my mechanics stethoscope and do some probing, but if anyone knows
what this is, I'd love to hear about it.
