Ok, I'm confused, I've read here so much about having the cylinder walls
resiliconized, and yet every once in awhile I read about the OEM sleeves in
the engines.  Help me out, which way is it??? is it different for the
different displacement engines???

Subject: Re: daytona 24hr questions

* does anyone know what we are going to see at daytona rolex this year?

I learned today that we are *not* going to see the GT1's there this 
year - major bummer.  They're not competitive with the other cars in 
GT1, and Porsche as usual will not support a series in which they 
cannot clean house.  The Rohr car was there for practice, but will not 
be there for the race.

There are also very few GT2 entries, so few that apparently they may be 
bumped to GT1.

Personal opinion: I wish the Factory would get their collective heads 
out of the sand.  These series don't want turbocharged cars, haven't 
for years, and have only let Porsche in with their damned turbos, 
handicapped, to fill the field and to take advantage of a famous marque 
in terms of its draw.  It's a normally aspirated, water cooled, 
multi-valved world outside of Zuffenhausen...

Hello Kevin

	I talked to the ROHR guys yesterday, they are indeed going to the 24 hours.
Who/where did you get your info from?  ROHR will be racing a Factory GT-1 EVO.
It is a new car from their last years GT-1 Yellow/Pirelli car. 
	Champion Porsche, in Florida will also be campaining a Porsche GT-1 car. 

	Yes - I have seen the lap times from practice on the Jan 10th. The Panoz cars
were indeed 7-8 sec faster per lap! 

	Panoz will have three cars for the 24 hours.

	There will be also one BMW/Meclarean.
