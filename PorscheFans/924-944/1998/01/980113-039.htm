I've been dying to talk about this, but didn't want to clutter the list
with non-p-car content, but since you sort of asked.  The best car game 
I've ever played is the Psygnosis Formula 1 game for the Playstation.
It's vehicle dynamics seem very accurate to a racing car.  You can't
change 9 million things on the car, which makes it easier to get adapted
to a track.  You can change the wing angles, tire compound, brake diameter,
brake bias, auto/manual, and level of play.  You get to choose from all
the tracks that they race on.  One day, I want to run SPA in a real car!

My favourite track is Monaco.  It is a blast running Schumacher's Ferrari
around that track in the wet on slick tires (when you run variable weather,
it can rain at any time), with oversteer with the slightest prod of the
throttle button.

The game is so in-depth that it takes quite a while to perfect your driving
on the tracks.  Once you can get a good qualifying lap in, then you can
take the challenge of racing the field.  Once you've met that challenge,
you can then raise the level of play from Rookie to Expert.  Once you've
reached that point, move on to the next track.  When you've mastered all
the tracks, it's time then to run a full season!

Jacques Villeneuve used this game last year to learn tracks that he had
not been on.  Oddly enough, he is the only driver not in the game, his
car is noted as "Williams #1".  I guess they didn't pay him enough to
use his name.

The game was pulled from the shelves a while back because Bernie wasn't
happy with Psygnosis using the F1 name.  Court battles ensued and the
game market came out ahead, so they should be back on the shelves by now.
