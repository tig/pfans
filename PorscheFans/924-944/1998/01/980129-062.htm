That is a ridiculous price!  Don't these guys realize that people can see
things around the world.  I don't mind paying a high end company "extra"
for their own products because of superior manufacturing or "one-off" types
of products, but I hate it when company's charge almost double for something
you can buy elsewhere.  I pulled these prices off Buschur Racing's web page.
If you want to buy from him, tell him I sent you:

>VDO 0-30psi boost gauge with vacuum hose and "T" fitting.      $55
>VDO 30-0-25psi boost gauge with installation kit.              $55

I personally like the 30-0-25 gauge as vacuum can tell you a lot about the
car's condition and leaks, etc.

http://www.buschurracing.com  You can order by emailing him or faxing or
phoning him and he'll have it sent out same day through UPS, etc.  Or even
USPS with such a small package.
