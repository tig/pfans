Patrick,
Sounds like you've got a good plan. Especially since it won't be depended=
 upon. Like Bob said you may not save money buying a fixer uppper... but =
who knows. You may get lucky. And at least you can do the work on your =
own time schedule and have a car that's exactly what you want it to be.

Personally, I'd still go for a newer car if money was not an issue (to =
your limit, of course). There will be plenty of work on a *mint condition=
* 85 or 86 to keep you busy.

There's two sides of the story. Main thing is to be sure what you're gett=
ing into. And sounds like your doing that.

Regards,
Joe

ps I know this doesn't answer your emissions ?? but 'fraid I don't have =
answers except that with an older car with no maintenance history there =
will be more hidden gotchas.

Keep us updated on your search. You are on the right track.
