Hi Dennis,

Yes I've got the Brooklands books.
Referencing to Porsches own Turbo S 88 Technical Bulliten.
The British "SE" differs from the American "Rose" in the following ways
only:
NO SUNROOF
NO CRUISE CONTROL
HUGE TURBO DECAL ON TOP OF THE FRONT RHS WING (similar to 924CGT)
NO AIR BAGS

The German Rose cars are identical to the British but no Decal.

I can only guess that the wieght distributions refered to are with the
tanks full and empty. The wieght of 80 litres of juice making a big
difference. Shall we throw the question open to the guys out there.

By the way once got a 14.022 standing quarter from my "Rose" at York
Dragway.
This was using a "Concrete launchpad" so you get much more spin than
with Tarmac.

Fellow list members,

A while back there was a thread on how fast our cars were. As bored as my
neighbor, Bob, and I were last night we decided to time a few sprints and see
how we compare to others on the list.  Please offer some feedback as to how
these times are.  I have no data to compare them too.

0-60
5.31 seconds
5.28 seconds
5.25 seconds
5.34 seconds

0-100
12.91 seconds
12.72 seconds
12.56 seconds

3,000 to 5,000 rpm beginning at 2,000 rpm
4.06
3.69
3.66

These times were taken on a concrete highway.  The grade is not perfectly
flat.  No runs were taken on any (perceivable) down hill grades.  Two adults
weighing a total of 380 lbs and 1/2 tank of fuel were in the car.  Outside
temperature was about 40 degrees F.

Car is an '86 951 w/ a mass flow kit by ProtoMotive/ProtoSport, K&N conical
air filter, 16" phone dials, Dunlop D40M2's (225's and 245's), and with the
exception of Turbo Cup sway bars an otherwise stock suspension.

The biggest problem we had on the standing starts was rear wheel traction.
The car spins the wheels even after shifting into second.  Being complete
amateurs at this we no doubt are not launching the car with it's full
potential.

BTW - does anyone know if the wheels off of an '98 993 Carerra S will fit on a
late offset 951?
