Jorge:

I don't know what your track experience is but it is typical to have many 
standing water (little "lakes") issues on a race track.  Brainerd 
International Race in Minnesota (my home track) is a good case in point. 
 The front stretch is also a dragstrip with concrete barriers lining both 
sides of the stretch.  In rain the combination of the barriers and the 
crown of the track create a rather substantial standing water challenge for 
the first half of the front stretch.  In this situation the SZ50 have 
performed well in reducing aquaplaning.  A tire ability to function well in 
wet weather is (to my understanding) a function of it capacity to 'vent' 
water out from under itself thereby allowing the rubber to meet the road, 
so to speak.  I think we are speaking of essentially the same issue. 
 However, as I previously stated, I am completely unfamiliar with the 690 
model and cannot make a comment on its wet performance at all.  My comments 
are strictly related to the SZ50.

P.S..  The SZ50 has a tread pattern very close to that of the Firestone 
Indy rain tire which is known for it superior performance in the wet.
