Hi Pfans!

Been driving our '89 924 for approximately six months now and it's a 
fantastic car.

Only at the time we bought it it had a minor oil leak. Bet you can all 
guess what happens next... our baby started to wet it's pants(the 
parking lot) more and more. Had it fixed by our (volkswagen) garage, 
replaced crank axle seals and 'oil reservoir cover' at $1.500,- (Dfl. 
3.000,--). it took a month for it to start wasting a gallon of 15 w40 to 
the 600 miles again. It appears to be the crank axle (if that is what 
it's called, haven't got my Haynes yet), it's 'off balance' and destroys 
the seals time after time. Garage advises replacement with factory 
rebuilt engine. Porsche doesn't offer that any more. Called two Porsche 
specialists, the first one offers an engine at dfl. 1.000,- (app. $500). 
Second one recommends a rebuild of our own engine at Dfl. 6.000 to 7.000 
($ 3.000 to 3.500) and tells us; if you buy another engine, you buy 
someone else's sh**. We have to determine whether the car's worth it or 
not. I can agree with him on that. We think the car's worth a rebuild, 
but on what basis does one (the market?) determine that. Has anyone 
encountered this or has the group discussed this before? We paid Dfl. 
5.750 ($2.850) when we bought it and app.Dfl 5.000,-- ($2.500) in 
repairs. Does one see the rebuild value back in market value? On the 
other hand I guess money isn't an appropriate measure here, the 
emotional value for us increases by the day.....

Appreciate the groups thoughts on this. THANK YOU!!
