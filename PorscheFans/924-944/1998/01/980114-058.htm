Now Rox, after all we went through together on that printer problem 
have you forgotten so soon that I was on Win95?! I'm heartbroken. :-
(

I've got two systems in my office. One at the reception desk and one 
in my exam room. The Win95 system is at the reception desk but I was 
bugging my receptionist too much getting online anytime there was 
down time in the office. So I put internet on the exam room system 
which happens to be 3.1. Patients sure do get in the way of my online 
activity. :-) BTW, what I did about the printer is I put a lousy old 
dot matrix on it and it works just fine, however without graphics or 
color. But who needs that anyway. I took the HP820 home since we 
didn't have a printer for it. 

Another BTW, so far I've let Lee give you all the heat about the pics.
 I'm still waiting for mine too. Just remember you have to include 
the 944. If you have a scanner I'm sure someone wouldn't mind putting 
them on their website. Any volunteers?
