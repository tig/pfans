While my car is in so many peices I thought I would run a few things by
the list.  I am in the process of a belt change on an 88 951S with 97K
miles.  While I am in there, I would like to do everything I can to
ensure I am not in there again in the near future.  The following are a
few things that have come up along the way.

1.  Water pump replacement.  I am not certain how old/miles the existing
pump has.  I have put about 30K on it.  Is there a way to test(eyeball
it) to determine condition?  Should I just change both the pump and the
stat while I am in there?

2.  I noticed some oil in the pipes going out of the intercooler to the
intake manifold.  Any advice.  Is a little oil OK?  No oil in the airbox
though.

3.  What seals are located on the front of the engine.  I would like to
replace these as well as the oil cooler seal at this time.

Thanks!

I have the opportunity to purchase a '77 924 for very little $$. It has 2
problems: 
1.  There is a rattle which occurs at about 2500 rpm's whether in gear or not.
It sounds like a bad U-Joint, but I know that they use a sealed driveshaft and
transaxle which would seem to mean that there is no U-Joint. And it also does
it when not in gear.
2.  This one I am not as concerned about - The blower motor for the heater
does not work. X fuse is fine.
Any advice on what may be the cause primarily of the rattle would be
appreciated. I am looking forward to becoming a Porsche owner, but don't want
a cash cow.
