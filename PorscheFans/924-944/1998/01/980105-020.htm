I'll take a whack at this.  My experience is with "S" models more than 
normal ones, but we did have Darren's car on the dyno before with APE Stage
II chips.

The results seem pretty normal.  It really depends on if the boost readings
above are peak or sustained.  The APE Stage II chips seem to peak high and
then immediately drop to a more normal level.  I don't recall Darren's
jumping that high, but a boost spike is nothing to be concerned about
(unless it's a really long spike).  From memory, Darren's 87 951 would
hit 15psi and then drop to 10psi after about 1 sec.  It would do this
in 4th gear (the only gear we used for testing).

If all is running fine and you've had no problems at 107k, leave it and
continue to have fun :)

Since you have a boost bolt setup, if the KLR picks up knock, it should
be able to dial back the boost to a level at which knock no longer
exists.  An interesting test would be to run the same tests you did above,
but with normal gas like Chevron or Shell or whatever instead of the
higher quality Sunoco stuff and see if the sustained boost level is lower.
