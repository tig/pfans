Before everyone gets all excited about "higher" compression ratios by
using a "thinner" head gasket, let us look at the facts.

The factory "stock" head gaskets for the 944/944S/951 are all 1.1mm
thick.  The PN. for the 2.5L 944/951 is #951.104.374.02, and the 2.7L
and 3.0L is #944.104.394.04.

Porsche produced a "thicker" head gasket which is 1.4mm thick to be used
with those cylinder heads that have been machined to a specified
dimension (in other words, those that have been milled, shaved, decked,
or whatever you want to call it) to bring the compression ratio back to
"stock" form and to have the proper clearances.  

The thicker gasket for the 2.5L 944/951 is #951.104.374.50 and for the
2.7L and 3,0L is #944.104.394.51.

When we have heads shaved...lets say....010", we usually just put the
stock size gasket back on.  For heads that are decked beyond that, we
usually install the thicker head gasket. 

The factory Workshop Manual gives wear dimensions for the cylinder
heads, as does Technical Bulletin Group 1, Number 9209, dated 11/3/1992.

Any questions...?
