Joseph,

I've done this more than a few times recently, usually late Sunday just
before I have to get the car on the road and drive from Massachusetts to
New York City...

I thought the steering wheel removal procedure in the Haynes manual was
adequate, though I don't remember any warning about how ornery the top
plastic cover on the steering column below the signal/wiper levers can be
when removing and replacing it. Be careful with those switches, too. My
wiper switch is now a little flakey, but I'm fairly sure I can correct it
next time I have it apart.

Per Haynes, do mark the steering shaft and steering wheel hub so you can
be sure you've got them aligned correctly on reassembly. Do the nut too -
I didn't notice before I started pulling everything off one time without
marking, and now my steering wheel is ever so slightly off. Now I have to
have the steering wheel ever so slightly off to one side of "true" or
else the car will not go straight. More than a little annoying, and
something I am determined to fix some weekend.

If you really want to get behind the instrument cluster, *do* remove both
of those plastic covers below the levers. You will then be able to pull
the cluster out more at the base, which may help you get your hand back
behind it. In either case, have a care when struggling with that cluster
as I found it was all too easy to scrape/mark it up on the exposed
steering shaft.

I havn't removed the speedo from the cluster. I have suffered painful
flesh wounds when trying to reattach the speedo cable to the meter. Go
into the engine compartment and see if you can get some slack in the
cable, and shove it in through the boot in the firewall. Every little
bit will help, at least with the old cable in mine, as there wasn't a
lot to start with.

Hmm. The left-side light for the speedo is what drew blood as I tried
to attach the speedo cable. And for my pains, the bulb stopped working
on me. And of course, if you follow the procedure of detaching the
battery, you can't tell until the desh's reassembled. If replacement is
necessary, I don't see how you could do it without detaching that !@#%$
speedo cable. Don't know yet if brand new bulbs will withstand the
trauma of reattachment better...

Hope something in there helps. I'll report back after I have replaced
my speedo cable.
