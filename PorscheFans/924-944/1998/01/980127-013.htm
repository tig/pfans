Whaletail 1-800-770-6945. 1-519-699-4911, 1-519-669-5130 (fax)

They're in Kitchener (Ontario), never dealt with them, but have heard good
things.

There is also a place in Calgary - don't know anything else about them.

Those are the only two I know of that specialize in Porsche parts mail
order. I suspect any of the larger dealers would accept mail orders as well.

You will find now for many things, the Canadian dealer price (after the
usual PCA club discount) can be the best price. It has been for every (yes,
*every*) part I've had to buy last year, especially when you take shipping
(afaik, no US "free shipping" parts place extends that offer to Canada),
exchange, brokerage, and GST (HST for you) into account.

E.g.:
951 euro fog/driving light assembly (no bulb or wiring) : $140-$170US from
the usual sources (+exchange, shipping, brokerage, GST) = $250-$300CDN
Local dealer price (euro fog/driving is the stock item in Canada) with PCA
club member discount: $140CDN (+GST +PST) =  $160CDN
