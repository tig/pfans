I do have an oil leak,  but it only leaks when the car is in storage.  I
was informed not to worry about it the engine just contracts enough to let
it leak.  I am burning oil though I had a compression test done in
prepurchase and the compressions were 120 in all four cyl. I was told by
the shop doing it that was average for a 100,000 ml. car.  I am wondering
if anyone has any suggestions on why this thing is burning oil.  other than
that the car is running fine.  It is not lacking power only when I really
get into it I will see a small amount of blue smoke behind me.  If anyone
has any suggestions please let me know.
