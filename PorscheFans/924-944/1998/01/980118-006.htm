Stephen,

Outstanding! Yes, I would have no problem waiting and would quite appreciate
receiving a copy, thank you. The comparsion is indeed an interesting one and
I also love your quote. I've been trying to encourage two friends, one with
a Testa Rosa and the other a ZR1, to attend a driver's education event here
(all day lapping sessions with controlled passing, in case you're not
familiar) for our own "comparison". Of course that always introduces the
driver variable but would still be a kick. Other than the latest 512 Testa
Rosa, the road test data I've seen shows the 951S could be the hands down
winner in that comparison as well.

If you don't have the Brooklands book, it includes a road test by Motor
Sport from 7/88 for the Turbo SE. If you would like a copy just let me
know -- sort of a swap. One statement made in that article really raised my
eyebrows though: "Incredibly, the weight distribution of the Turbo SE is
virtually the same as that of the rear engined 911, with 59% over the rear
axle. Happily, the polar moments, or resistance to turning, are very
different; if the back of the 944 steps out, a momentary flick of the wrist
is enough to hold it until the tyres lock on to the line again." Either the
Turbo SE is quite different from our Turbo S, which we know it isn't, or
Motor Sport has their facts wrong because every other publication I've ever
seen to quotes only a 50/50 weight distribution.

Another article in the Brooklands collection is a Car and Driver article
from 6/88 which has  a great title byline: "A bargain at $48, 350."
Interestingly, they tested a special order Turbo S with a 3.89 differential
that topped out at 140. That same month Road & Track also published a track
test and here's how they compared:

3.89 Data:  0-30=2.0;  0-40=3.0;  0-50=4.1;  0-60=5.5; 0-70=7.1;  0-80=8.8;
0-100=13.6; & 1/4 mi=13.9/101
3.38 Data:  0-30=2.2;  0-40=3.3;  0-50=4.3;  0-60=5.5; 0-70=7.3;  0-80=9.1;
0-100=14.1; & 1/4 mi=14.2/100

Note:  0-60 were the same because with the 3.89 they had to shift to 3rd at
56mph due to the rev limiter. Car & Driver also had this to say about the
3.89 differential... "Knappenberger's (dealer in Phoenix) customer knows his
final-drive ratios. On the street and in traffic light shoot-outs, the Turbo
S with the shorter gearing had much better throttle response than the stock
car. In day-to-day driving, the factory car's extra top end is acedemic.
Most people who don't live in Turn Three at Daytona rarely need to travel
160 mph." I wonder how many other Turbo S's have the 3.89 rear end. And it's
also interesting to try and translate these figures into track
performance....

Hhhmmm, how much to change the ring & pinion Mr. Porsche mechanic.
