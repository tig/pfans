And we do not even have to mention the 968 envy that the TURBO guys have 
(which is unparalled).  Lee finally gave in once his 951S U-boated.

Hi everybody.  I just purchased another 951.  This one needs a water pump,
timing belt and a windshield wiper.  Do any of you know where I can find these
cheaper than from the dealer?  Also, in replacing the water pump and timing
belt, how much more expensive is it to replace the gaskets and the rollers and
the balance shaft belt?  What part of this could I do myself?  What part
should I have the shop do?  Any help will greatly be appreciated.
