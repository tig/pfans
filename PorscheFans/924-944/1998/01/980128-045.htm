Specifically what type of repairs at home do you want to accomplish?  I
think Time-Life published a whole series of books covering the range of
roof repairs to floorings to cabinet-making.

Seriously, though, you should stop by your local Pep Boys, Trak Auto, etc
and pick up the Haynes #1027 ($15-20) for starters.  Then, you can check
into getting the factory manuals ($250 & up, depending on source).  Also,
check with your local PCA region to see if any members might give you a
hand or if they have any "Tech Sessions" scheduled.  Try hanging around
your local P-car repair facility and get friendly with the "wrenches".

Good Luck, and keep hanging around this list......you'll learn a lot here.
