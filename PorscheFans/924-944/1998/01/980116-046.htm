I own a 1980 924, and it's really getting hard to start when it's cold, 
especially in the morning.  Can anyone give me any suggestions of what 
might be the problem???

This is what happens:
When I turn the key, the engine turns but doesn't catch.
When it does happen to catch, it quickly dies.
After a few minutes it works it's way up to idleing but it's VERY rough, 
and the RPM's cycle from about 50-2000 RPM's.
After a few more munites of idleing, it settles down and is ready to be 
driven.


This is what I have done:
Replaced Cold start valve
Replaced Thermo-time switch
Checked auxilary air regulator
Replaced fuel filter
I've put Dri-gas in my tank with the past 5 tanks of gas
I used Dura-lube fuel injector cleaner and Oil treatment


Please help me...

How right you are!  When I bought my car there were people who thought I
must've paid $50,000 for it.  One person even accused me of drug dealing to
afford a car like this.  Little did they know that I got it for $5000!

All this fun and still $3500 less than a new Kia Sephia!

All,
Reciently Don posted part numbers for caliper seals.  Is anyone familiar with
the steps and required parts to rebuild calipers?  Mine are really cruddy, and
tend to drag the pads somewhat.  I've even had one lock up at DE once.  They
were about to flag me, but the smoke subsided when the run was over.  I warped
the rotors to.  I'm sure this condition was helped along by the fact that I
had just resurfaced the rotors and one was right at spec, and one was just a
hair below spec in thickness.

All,
The following is an excerpt from the 944FAQ.  My question is regarding the #3
and #4 items.  What is lower bore in the stut and what bolt and nut is being
refered to?

Bob

Neither set of arms noted above pose a problem, as long as:

1.The ride height is not lowered beyond the point which causes binding of the
ball joint when the suspension reaches full travel, 
2.The front sway bar is not greater than the M030 package sway bar in either
0.D. or wall thickness, 
3.The lower bore in the strut is not worn out and 
4) the parts are assembled following the steps outlined in the Porsche Service
Manual. (Despite the fact that this may be slightly contrary to the Service
Manual, it is imperative that the bolt and nut (original Porsche Parts) be
replaced each time they are removed.

As editor of the PCA San Diego Region Newsletter, I wanted to pass on an
article written by one of our members, Vince Knauf, about a simple
modifications made several years ago to his '83 944 that has made a tremendous
improvement on the life expectancy of his clutch. Vince and his wife, Cecelia,
have tracker their car at least once a month since 1984. Here's the reprint
from our January issue:

So You Want Your Clutch to Last, by VVVince Knauf
courtesy PCA, San Diego Region "Windblown Witness"
Having driven our 944 on the street and track since new in 1983, I have
learned a great deal about the "failure modes" of this well balanced Porsche.
This includes "the belt," the motor mounts, the intermixer seals, various
other seals and most importantly, THE RUBBER CENTER OF THE CLUTCH. This
fiendish device was designed as a drive train shock absorber to quiet drive
line noise and vibration, and to keep your transmission and ring gear alive
during hard driving. It does these jobs real well. What it doesn't do real
well is LAST A LONG TIME. A clutch will wear out when the friction surface of
the clutch disc has worn away from use. The rest of the clutch components that
are replaced at the same time that a worn out clutch disc is replaced SHOULD
LAST LONGER THAN THE CLUTCH. They will be replaced when the clutch wears out,
so as long at there is some life left in them when the clutch disc wears out,
we all feel okay about it. The rubber center hasn't gotten this message. The
most common failure mode of the 944 clutch is that there is a "clunk" when you
let the clutch out and when you get on or off the gas while driving. This is
the failed rubber center now in "limp home mode." It is about to throw a piece
of the rubber between the clutch disc and the pressure plate, so that you
cannot release the clutch at all and it's ability to absorb drive line shock
is gone. Get to your mechanic quickly for the ~$1,000+ clutch replacement. If
you have been driving aggressively (it is a Porsche after all), this moment
will likely come way too soon. And when the mechanic pulls the clutch, he will
likely tell you that the rubber center is gone, but there are many miles still
left on the friction surfaces of the clutch plate, and that every thing else
looks great. Your rubber center just ate your clutch (and ~$1,000+). Okay,
this is a failure mode, but does it have to happen again? Has the factory come
up with a fix? Sorry, not that I have heard of. The 944 turbo has a spring
center clutch, but it doesn't fit my NA (normally aspirated) car.
But why has the rubber disc died? A very likely cause is HEAT. Heat from
aggressive clutch use. Heat that built up from REPEATED aggressive clutch use.
Porsche is engineered in Germany. There are no drag strips in Germany. The
"stop light grand prix" that we are all familiar with really doesn't exist in
Germany. The autobahn does. So Do curvy Bavarian back roads. Porsche builds
it's cars for the German driving conditions. Not for AGGRESSIVE CLUTCH USE. 
There is little provision for cooling the clutch of the 944 that got
overheated from aggressive street driving or more particularly, autocross and
time trial driving. Porsche did realize that the "dual mass flywheel" in the
993 needed extra cooling. This flywheel is very similar to a rubber center
clutch like in the 944. The 993 has a good size suction hose from the bell
housing to the air cleaner. This sucks warm air from around the clutch and
flywheel into the air cleaner as the engine inhales. The clutch dust ends up
in the air filter, and there is a constant stream of cool under car air sucked
into the bell housing to cool the clutch. In the 993 the bell housing is about
8 inches from the air cleaner housing. In the 944 this distance is much
longer. The 944 up to ‘88 uses a similar suction hose to cool the timing belt
which is about 4 inches from the air cleaner. 
My mechanic, Steve Grosskemper at Dieter's, found another way to cool my
clutch. I am already using cooling ducts for the front brakes ducted from the
front spoiler. Steve placed a 2x2 inch air  collector in the radiator air flow
on the left side, and connected this to a 2 inch flex hose that he ran just
inboard of the left front suspension (it is cooler on this side with no
exhaust pipe). This ran back to the bell housing and was plumbed into the bell
housing at the lower clutch inspection hole near the clutch slave cylinder.
This was connected with what the factory would call a "locally manufactured"
fitting. (This is Porsche factory talk meaning that the mechanic has to figure
out how to make it fit.) It is held in place with a set screw. 
This blows cool outside air on the clutch disc when ever the car is moving. I
suspect that the length of the hose is such that no significant dirt or water
makes it's way to the clutch. Since we have had the clutch cooler in place,
the death of the rubber disc has stopped. I replaced the clutch for rubber
disc failure at 31,000 miles and again at 58,000 miles. We installed the
cooler at 61,000 miles. Now with 120,000 miles on the car, and 62,000+ on the
current clutch, we continue to autocross aggressively during 8-12 two driver
events each year with a healthy rubber clutch disc. Engineering that the
factory should have done.
