Well, I managed to have my first accident in at least a decade.  I hurt my
beautiful P-Car something awful.  What I'm trying to figure out now is what
I should have done differently.  At only 15mph, no less.  I was at a
stoplight in the outside lane of a two lane left turn.  Very wet roads but
only light rain at the time.  I have an 88 951 with 3 month old SP8000s in
the rear and old SP8's with about half the tread left on the front.  Just
as I made it through the turn, I lost the rears.  There was no warning but
it was a smooth slide.  I did not chop the throttle, I did not hit the
brakes, I may have let up on the throttle a little.  What I did do was pull
(probably jerk) the steering wheel about 1/8 of a turn into the slide.
Both fronts let go.  After two wiggles without a bite, I panicked and
pulled the steering wheel another 1/8.  I assume that this is where I went
wrong.  The car caught with the front immediately followed by the back and
I was sideways (in the opposite direction) faster than I would have
believed possible.  I had another decision point here which I never
considered at the time.  Instead of riding it out, I chopped throttle and
gave the wheel a half turn left.  This brought me back around and I
straightened the wheel but ran out of road.  By this point, I was doing
under 10mph when I caught the curb with the right front at a slight angle
(< 15 degrees).  My control arm snapped right in half while my wheel
suffered only a 1/4 inch gouge at the rim.  From there, things only got
worse.  I hopped the curb with the front, and what was there to greet me
but a steel light pole which worked it's way from my lower right bumper
down about 10 inches of quarter panel.  It didn't push inward, just ran
down the side.  The rear never went up the curb, the front dropped back off
the curb and there I was, parallel parked at the curb.


To give you an idea of the speed and distance, I was no more than 40 feet
from the intersection.  Obviously, if I had gone slower, none of this would
have happened.  I never left first gear and I "think" I must have passed 3k
rpm right at then end of the turn which is where I've got a real power peak
and I assume that's why the rears broke.  I'm pretty sure I reacted
correctly for my car at that point but I don't understand how both front
tires started to slide under those conditions.  It's amazing how fast your
brain is working under those circumstances :-(  I also know I let the car
try to ride it out for 2 "wiggles" as it tried to grab.  I did not come off
the gas.  Should I have?  I'm sure the rpms went up as the rears spun but I
don't remember.  

Reviewing the accident in my mind, I'm very disappointed.  First, I'm
unhappy with the hardware (car).  I don't feel like the fronts should have
broken traction the way they did.  While waiting for a tow, I watched the
traffic but didn't see anyone else losing traction in that turn.   I'm also
unhappy with the front control arm.  I know most of my speed was bled off
by the time I hit the curb and the control arm snapped while the wheel
suffered very minor damage along the lip.  But what I'm really disappointed
with is the software (driver).  For the most part, I seem to have made the
wrong decisions at almost every point of the event.  At these low speeds, I
had (relatively) plenty of time to react.  Yet I seem to have reacted with
my testicles rather than my brain.  By the way, I found these appendages
lodged firmly at about mid chest later that evening.  I should have gone
into the turn more slowly, I might have been able to turn into the skid
more smoothly, I could have ridden it out (even into the curb), I could
have let the counterslide finish it's course.  I distinctly remember a
"freeze frame" of being almost in control of the car at 90 degrees.

As soon as I joined the PCA, I looked at signing up for a driver's ed.
However, I didn't have enough receipts from the PO to feel comfortable
about thrashing around until I had belts, hoses, brakes, tires, etc. set up
to my satisfaction.  And, that event was subsequently cancelled.  Boy, am I
sorry about that now.  I've had some experience with rear wheel drive cars
on the East coast in rain & snow and I've been riding motorcycles for years
so I watch my turns and yet, I totally blew it.

By the way, if this kind of thing happens to you, watch it with the towing
guys.  They had 3 guys/towtrucks out there trying to figure out how to tow
my car without causing more damage.  Actually, one guy was training, I
think.  One guy had experience (thank God) and what they did was use the
stinger (extensible tow arm) to get under the good wheel and up against the
broken one.  Then they lifted just far enough to get a jackstand under the
broken side.  From there, they rearranged the stinger and strapped the good
and broken wheels down.  While they were basically towing from one side,
they cinched everything down tight and it seemed like the best solution.
Surprisingly, there were no clearance problems in the rear with the front
jacked up.

Comments welcome.  Please try to keep the recriminations down as I feel bad
enough already :-(  About the only small note of sunshine in this is that I
guess I won't have to worry about the ball joint on that side.  One thing I
am worrying about now is an unbalanced front end.  With the control arm
broken, the wheel/hub assembly was hanging on the top shock mount.  I'm
guessing that this may have tweaked the strut.  Anyway, do both control
arms need to be replaced at the same time?  Enough so that the insurance
company will pay?  Two other bad things when they jacked the car up and
moved it.  My lights went out and something (coolant) started leaking.
AAAAARRRRGHHHH!
