Chris,

I've used a product called E-Z bleed that I got from AJ-USA and sells for
$44.50 in their current catalog. The "supply" side is gravity feed with a
nifty aluminum check valve which is just inverted and placed in your master
cylinder reservior. At the wheel, there is a hose which attaches to the
bleed valve at the caliper with a one-way valve that stops air from bleeding
back in. With the combination of the two units, one person can easily bleed
the brakes solo.

AJ-USA can be reached at 1-800-877-1911, e-mail at ajusa@ajusa.com or their
web page is http://www.ajusa.com .

They also have a few other interesting items including complete hose kits
with a 16-piece Turbo S set going for $103.95 or an genuine Porsche Tire
Inflator for $64.95.

<<On April 9th I have a reservation for a factory tour while I am in Germany
on vacation.  Does anyone know how to get to Nurburgring (sp?) from the
factory?  Does anyone know where I can rent a Porsche for three days?>>

Directions to Nurburgring Race track in Germany:

Nurburgring is about a 2 hour drive from Frankfurt, if memory serves me
correct?

from Frankfurt take the "A3" towards "Koln"
continue on "A48" towrads "luxemberg"
then follow the "B258" to "Nurbergring"

Note: if you purchase a Michilen map/book the track is listed in there. 
The road leading to the track are almost as good as the track itself!

Be sure to take a day for the track and the "RennSport Museum" ! One lap is 14
miles long, it takes about 20 minutes a lap to drive with a rental car.  The
Museum is great! The track is even better!  

Be sure to rent the 'Ring Taxi" a BMW M5 driven at speed around the track for
something like $85 a lap!  Next time I am at Nurbergring I will do this
option!!!

The Museums phone number is: (02691) 302-147  Mondays the museum is closed.
The track closes at nightfall. 


As far as a Rental Porsche, I think "Europa Car" ala Hertz will rent 911's.
You should contact Farzann for more info on rental cars - since he was just
there a few months ago.

Aluminum bolts? I don't think I have seen any. What is the application for
these bolts?

Look under the hood of any new '97 & up model Audi/VW/Porsche product.

Uhh - err - I Goofed!   

What I meant to say is that the steel - high strength bolts have a blue-
coating to prevent a chemical reaction when installed into say in aluminum
intake manifold. 

The coating prevents any reaction when two different types of material are
fastened. 

Thanks Doug for pointing out the error of my ways....

To all,

I haven't had a chance to post to the list in several months, but you can
advertise Porsches and Porsche related items (parts, literature, wanted, etc)
in PML for free. Our magazine comes out monthly and goes to a very targeted P-
car audience. Ads need to be to us by Jan 25th to be in the Feb issue which
will mail around the 10th of Feb. You can email them.

Thanks and regards,

Phil Van Buskirk, PMLetter@aol.com
