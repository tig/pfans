Denny,

If I could justify the investment, I would MUCH, MUCH rather install a
6-speed.  The shorter gearing of the 3.89 option is great for
acceleration, but it really does destroy the high speed cruising
capability of our cars -- definitely one of their strengths.  The
6-speed truly is the best of both worlds.

That said, If Lee refuses to part with his transmission, a possible
compromise is to install the 3.89 rear end AND install bigger rear tires
(i.e. larger circumference).  This would give you shorter gearing than
stock for better acceleration, but not so short that high speed cruising
is tiring.  Anyway, just a thought.
