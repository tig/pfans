I was getting some help from Chris H on fixing a turbo problem, he said
:

-----
The KLR faults do not go through the "!" on the dash.  The tool plugs
into the
KLR socket and has a blinker on it that blinks.

I assume that you have checked all lines and made sure they didn't have
any
leaks?  One line you can check is the line dropping down to the
wastegate.  The
easiest way to check this is to raise the car and see where the line
goes up
to.  The wastegate is at the connection of the exhaust pipes.  It has
some heat
fins on it and a hose going up to the engine compartment.

The other item that may not working correctly is the cycling valve.

I'll find out what the part number is for the KLR diagnosis tool.

If you are building *no* boost (the gauge does not move at all, and you
don't
feel a power surge).  Your turbo may be seized.

You may want to check the line to the KLR box though.  It is connected
to the
intake manifold between the 4 and 3 intake pipes.  It is a hard
yellowish
translucent tube.  It drops to the passenger foot well where the
computers are.
 It plugs into the KLR box.

Which might help out people.

Also, I called my porsche and tried to get some info on getting those
computer codes.

He said :

The device to retrieve the codes is called a "Bosch Hammer"  [ a.k.a
Hammer] (because it slightly resembles a hammer).  He would be happy to
sell me on for $1500 !  So, i don't think any of us will be getting any
of those codes anytime soon.

If anyone knows of any other way (perhaps a CHEAP aftermarket scanner,
like the ones in trak auto for domestic cars) let us know.

The haynes manual procedure says for 1990 and later porsche (i dunno if
thats 944 though)
