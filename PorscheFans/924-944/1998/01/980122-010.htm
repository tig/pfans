I finally found a US supplier for a thin head gasket for our cars - recall a
recent message asking for translation from German which was a special
build list specifying (among other things) an increase in compression due
to a reduced (1mm) thickness head gasket having been installed. The
stock head gasket is 1.5mm thick.

PAECO Industries makes custom _copper_ head gaskets (especially
useful for turbos, won't blow out) in thicknesses of .030" and .060"
(0.76mm and 1.52mm, respectively). They can be re-used also. Due to
the material used, of course, the mating surfaces must be flat. They also
have lots of other interesting racing stuff - I've heard good things about
them. They have a website at www.quicklink.net/bham/paeco/home/html
and can be reached by email at paeco@quicklink.net

Unfortunately, their website doesn't do their catalog justice (I've seen it).

Anyway, just in case someone out there was looking for this info... As
always, I have no relation with this supplier, etc.
