A CIS mystery:
Has anyone experienced deterioration of fuel lines after using Wurth valve
cleaner or Techtron Fuel System Cleaner?  My story:  After a 5k trip in a
'79 924 I began a tune-up.  Before adjusting the valves I ran Wurth valve
cleaner throught the system.  On the next tank of gas, since I was unable to
get high octane fuel several times on the trip, I ran Techtron Fuel System
Cleaner through the system.  I replaced spark plugs wires, rotor, plugs,
etc. and the ignition and timing tested fine.
Within the week, a cold start problem arose.  The warm-up regulator and cold
start valve tested bad.  After replacing, a warm-start problem occurred.
The accumulator was leaking and replaced, but the warm-start problem
persisted. (Diaphrams going...)
When checking the fuel filter, I found the insides were black and the fuel
was dirty.  I filtered the gasoline and looked at it under a dissecting
microscope and it was loaded with black threads, brass nuggets, and glass
grains.  To the naked eye, the filter appeared dusty black.
While testing the check valve in the pump, the rear fuel line leaked when I
put a clamp on it, and so this was replaced along with the fuel pump since
the brass in the filter indicated to me it was coming apart.
The warm-start problem persists.  I'm wondering with all of the black crud
in the old filter if the other fuel lines are coming apart.  Does Porsche
paint the inside of the gas tank with black paint?

Control pressure hot and warm check is good, but the pressure leak test is
below specs.  (O lbf/in3 in 20 min).  Joints, check valve, and control
pressure valve look good.  Injectors good spray, no leaks; fuel pump output
good.  Could the system lose pressure through the hoses without an apparent
fuel leak?  The rubber fuel hoses should all be replaced, but should the
plastic wire braided lines be replaced also?

Any advice on this whodunnit would be greatly appreciated.  Sorry for the
long post, but this one has me stumped.
