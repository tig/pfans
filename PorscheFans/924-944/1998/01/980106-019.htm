Bill --

No, don't worry. I was asking about replacing the chain, not the chain
tensioner.  You're correct that the chain tensioner can be replaced w/out
removing the chain.  

I was hoping that the chain could be replaced w/out removing the cams.  A
mechanic I know suggested using an open chain, and linking it once it was
wrapped around the cam sprockets.  This would save time and money,
particularly if you don't have the timing belt tensioning tool.

=0A=0AHello P-Fans=0A=09In regards to my boost readings, the boost level =
reported was=0A not a spike upon an upshift but sustained reading in gear=

Hello P-Fans

	I should also mention that according to my 
RSR Air/Fuel Ratio Gauge, even running 19 psi 
of boost, the APE chips seem to proved enough 
fuel. My RSR air/fuel metter reads 12.7:1 parts
 of air to fuel. just what is should be for 
maximum acceleration.
