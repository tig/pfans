I'll second the stuck tach. Haven't managed to fix it yet - I suspect
mine is internally faulty. (I played with the wiring and couldn't figure
it out. Keep in mind there's some real volts in there, so don't mess
with it while the car is running. <g>

However, for my bouncy temp guage, I found that if I press the connector
to the side while operating, it returns to normal. I tightened up the
sockets in the connector to no avail. I suspect I may have a cold solder
joint on the temp guage connector side of things, but I haven't been
able to disassemble it yet.

Fun stuff.

Alex.
'84 944.

PS - a quick tip, you don't need to remove the steering wheel, ign
switch, etc - you can simply reach behind the dash and push the
instruments out of the cluster. Watch out for that speedo cable, it's a
PITA to get it back on.
