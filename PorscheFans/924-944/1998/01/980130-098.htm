I hope this isn't a double.  I think the first is lost in the ethernet.

Heh, I've always heard that if a plan is too good, it's an ambush :)

This one would definitely be a compromise as I *really* want a 944S and
I've seen several advertised in the "slightly over 5K" range, but if
this one looks like a "deal", it would give me something to play with
for now.  Plus, I've got a teenage daughter that will be driving in a
couple years(a red-headed heart breaker - steady boys<g>).  Wouldn't be
too much lost if she prangs it.

Well, I know that I know enough to get myself into trouble.  But then, I
also know where to ask my questions.  I appreciate all the responses,
both pro(one brave soul did say "go for it") and con.  I've had several
other projects over the years, but this will be my first German car with
the exception of an 86 Jetta(hmm, was that *really* German or did they
build those in N.A.?).

Will do!  I think the search is half the fun :o)  BTW, I've found my way
off the digest so you guys can stop the cc's now.

Thanx,
Patrick
