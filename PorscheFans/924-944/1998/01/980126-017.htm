I have a 1983 924 which recently had a new fanbelt put on - since then on
somedays, like today it runs beautifully, others like last night it squeals
throughout the day.  I asked a few friends who are a "bit" knowledgable and
they've all come up with the answer that "all the old fords used to do
that..." - this whilst being a wonderful fact is of course o use to me - if
anyone has any ideas why it should do this please let me know...

PS I had a new washerpump fitted in my 924 at Phillip Walsh specialist cars
near York when it went during the winter whilst they were sorting the
windscreen wiper switches and the cold start problem and the total bill was
only 70 (plus they didn't treat me like a porsche pretender like some of
the larger places...)
