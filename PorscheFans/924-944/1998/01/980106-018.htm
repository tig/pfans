Chris,
aftermarket wiring is usually run down either side of the car.  Start by =
removing the lower door sill trim piece.  Pull up on it near the front =
of the door.  There is a screw in the bottom of the rear quarter trim =
panel at the edge of the door that needs to be removed. With the door =
sill trim removed, pull up the weatherstripping about a foot, starting =
at the bottom front corner.  You can peel back the cloth edge of the =
carpet along the kickpanel.  The wires can be run along this route, and =
under the edge of the rear quarter trim panel, to the rear cargo area.  =
Once there, run it behind the carpet on the side of the fenders.  I know =
some of this may not make sense if you've never done it before, but it's =
really not to tricky.  Just be careful to proceed slowly when pulling on =
carpet that's glued down, because the glue Porsche uses is very strong =
and the carpet may tear.  I've owned two 944s and two 951s, and =
installed stereos and alarms in several others.  If you need any ideas, =
or more tips email me.
                                                                         =

Subject: Running speaker wires...

I've finally grown tired of the dismal sound in my 951.  I'm from NJ so
if it can't go really loud I gets this empty feeling. :)  Anyway, I need
to run power and an RCA cable to the trunk area from the dash.  How do I
do this?  Every #!%! damn piece of interior seems glued down or
impossible to remove.  Can I run wires back along the transaxle hump
under the carpet?  Is there some common place where Porsche runs the
wires? (like for the rear hatch release).  I have a glue gun so I'm not
afraid to pull up carpet.  I just don't want to pull it up and not find
a place to run the wires...
