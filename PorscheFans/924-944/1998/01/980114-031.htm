Thanks for the kind words.  I would say, wait until the old one goes bad,
but if you have some time, might as well do it now.  On the shop's computer,
I snuck a peak at the cost price, it's around C$35 or US$25.  I paid around
C$44 since they have to make some money :)  For that small amount of money,
I'd rather have a metal re-enforced bypass valve than the plastic ones.

Powerhaus claims that the stock valves go about every 40,000mi which is
exactly the life mine had, or about once a year for track driven cars.
I don't know how accurate the last statement is, but mine and Paul's are
both dead at 40,000mi.

Keep in mind that if your stock valve is dead, the intake path is so
quiet in the 944T that you won't even hear the compressor surge, kind
of like a "cha-cha-cha" noise when you let off.  That compressor surge
puts tremendous loads on the compressor wheel.  The purpose of the unit
is to remove the pressure from between the compressor wheel and the
throttle body when the throttle is shut.  This frees up the path for
the new charged air to come through without having to fight the pressure
that would be in there if not for the bypass valve.  In the olden days,
it was common for compressor wheels to almost come to a stop during
shifts because of the pressure waves from shutting the throttle.  Some
turbo rebuild companies even claim that the compressor wheel can spin
backwards w/o a good compressor bypass valve (I find that hard to believe
with that sucker spinning at 50,000+rpm, but it gets the point across
I guess).

A properly operating compressor bypass valve makes a single "cha" noise,
but it's difficult to hear on the 944T unless you are outside or if you
are running with no air filter.
