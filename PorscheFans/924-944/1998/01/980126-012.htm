Hi Don, have you ever noticed this broken spot weld to contribute to the
power locks cycling up and down when the key is inserted?

I had that very problem plus the central locking light was on all the time.
Once I rewelded the spot, the central locking worked properly and the power
locks quit doing the fandango.

A note to anyone contemplating spot welding is to disconnect your battery
to protect your DME. I even pulled the plug on the DME as I didn't want to
leave anything to chance.

Another thing that contributes to window rattling is the felt strip slides
down in the channel thus the glass is loose.
