Hi Tom,

We've spoken before a little about my 86 951 conversion to the 
S interior, but I didn't say how I solved my amp problem. I had an
Alpine amp (4X50) that had the 2" problem, you know just 2" too big
to fit anywhere.  What I found out was, since I had the seats out to run
the wiring, that my amp would fit upside down attached to the under
side of the passenger seat. It was low profile enough to fit between 
the seat bottom and the bar running from each side of the track.  I
ran a bunch of tywraps to position it. The wiring was run under the
carpet to under the middle of the seat, where it emerges in a couple
of plastic wiring tubing to allow the seat full travel. All in all it
worked out quite nicely.

Another idea that was suggested to me was the spare tire cubbyhole.
Mount the amp to a board, Add 2 wedges to go between the tire
and the board and voila!  Of course, I couldn't do that with mine
(see the 2" problem above).

Good Luck!

A "Z" speed rating means the tire is rated for speeds in excess of 149 mph.
A  "Z" with a "W" after it indicates over 149 but limited to 168.  If it has a
"Z" with a "Y" after it it's good to 186.  These sub ratings appeared about 5
to 6 years ago.
The only W I've seen was on a 225/45R17 for a Mercedes.  I.ve never seen a
"Y".
Most likely the W and Y are vehicle manufacturer specifications given  to the
tire companies.
