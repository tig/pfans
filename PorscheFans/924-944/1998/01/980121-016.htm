Amen brother Lee!  The replacement 944 hatch struts that I installed on my
1980 924 turbo have been a pure disaster.  They are much stiffer than the old
struts (that's why I needed new ones).  But, I suspect they are also stiffer 
than the original equipment in showroom condition.  Besides the stiffness,
the new 944 replacements don't seem to have any damping action toward the 
end of the extension like the old ones had.  This damping action would slow
the hatch down a bit before it reached the fully opened position, thus reducing
stresses on the frame and hinges.  My hatch frame broke loose and warped at the
left hinge almost immediately after installing the new 944 struts.

I hope Porsche is not employing reduced engineering on its replacement parts.
I strongly suspect someone is putting Porsche part number stickers on 
inferior third-party products.  Caveat emptor!
