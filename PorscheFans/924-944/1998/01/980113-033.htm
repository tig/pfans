Hi Folks,
 Just to add the the control arm failure thread

The major problem with the Fabcar arms is they need to be inspected
regularly, or some how cover up the ball joint to prevent stuff (like sand,
dirt) from getting in there.
	 In addition I have witnessed two a-arm failures. One was on a
track car, the other was at an Auto-X. Both broke the arm at the sway bar
mount area. The arm essentially bent/broke in half.  These people were
running slicks, and large sway bars. It is not a pretty sight.  The Auto-X
car destroyed the entire front left fender, and had to be dragged off
course. The track car wasn't as heavily damaged in the body dept, but still
had to be towed out of the way. Also this was on the west coast in sunny
southern California.
