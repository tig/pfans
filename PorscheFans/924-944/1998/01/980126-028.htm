I know the "round sockets" look very tempting but they are NOT
jack-safe. They will go in and bend the undercarriage giving your
interior floor a nice tilt. After much painful experience I have
concluded that the 944 does not have a place on the undercarriage that
is safe to jack. You will see the designated jack points marked by the
little diamonds under each door on the rocker panels, but these will
also deform eventually. Besides lifting the car at those points makes
for a very unstable 944. Using a block of wood on the two undercarriage
"rails" works, but it eats away a little bit of undercoating every time.

I have been using the A-arm mounts and the rear shock mounts for a while
now and this seems to avoid mutilation while giving me the height and
stability I like.
