	Today I met with Mr. Rick Perkins, Porsche District Service Manager for LA
and west US for total of 7 years.  He telexed the Weissach Germany R&D
Center on the chain tensioner.  They said the chain tensioner plastic
rubbing blocks (same material as 911 uses) and chain do not fail unless: 1)
cam belt fails, 2) engine has overheated which can weaken the plastic
rubbing
blocks, and/or 3) engine was over reved.  But at 90,000 miles, the rubbing
blocks on my car were worn pretty well, and that makes the plastic thinner,
and more prone to failure in my humble engineering opinion.  I will still
inspect and replace it when the blocks are worn.

Concerning the cam belt his advice was this: 1) use only Porsche belts, 2)
new or old belts should not be bent excessively to inspect them ( can break
internal fibers that give it strength), 3) get belt replacement work done
at dealer where you get a 2 year parts and labor warranty, 4) the 2,000 to
2500 mile re-tensioning is crucial to the life of the belt! (loose belts
can get harmonic type shaking/jumping around that can cause premature
failure), 5) inspect belt every 15,000 miles (bend it while on, looking for
cracks from one side to other, and use fingernail to see if teeth are
getting weak and chip away with fingernail) even though Porsche recommends
inspect/adjust after 30,000, 6) replace belt at 30,000 miles if there is
any doubt about it's condition, and 7) never let the belt go even 1,000
miles over 45,000 miles.

Other suggested maintenance: 1) Change coolant (use phospahate free only)
every 2 years (old coolant can eat away at fiber head gasket), 2) Change
brake fluid ever 2 years (to prevent calipers from sticking), 3) change oil
every 3-5,000 miles, or every year if don't reach mileage, 4) use 20W50 oil
( I use castrol and at 90,000 there was no discoloration on head under
valve cover).
