Hey Guys,
I need some performance advice. i own a 79 924 stock hp is said to at
115@5500 but id like to see it as near 200hp as economicly possiable. 
Of coarse making the car lighter by replacing hood and quarters with
fiberglass and such would make it quicker but id like to have more power
under the hood, without buying a new car or doing a engine swap.
QUESTION #1: has anyone ever seen or produced a higher performance 924??
QUESTION #2: How realistic is this??
I had the car since 94 and drive it almost everyday, id like to keep it that
way. Id like more hp with nearly the same reliablty i have today.
QUESTION #3: Iam also looking for any 924 front fenders, hood, and header
panel for sale. thats cheap :) thats the trick eh.
	Some thoughts of mine for hp. please respond with advice thoughts or
ideas 
A >replacing exhaust system with perform. muffler and header.
  >rebuid the head w perform. cam and new lifters& valves ect. and
with perform. throttle body.
now going to more extrems.
B >boring out the block to eurospecs and replacing the pistons w perform.
going from 86.5 to 87.0 would this really help??
  >some thing id like to avoid. is replacing the fuel injection cis with
carburetors. btw how much hp would this add. and is their a weber conversion
kit for the 924.
vielen dank, LAGES
The only good porsche is a driving porsche!!

In a message dated 98-01-23 00:36:53 EST, you write:

<< I have just discovered a pool of water under the carpet in the rear
 passenger seat. It is rainwater coming in from an unknown leak in the body.
 If anyone has had a similar problem and has a fix please let me know. >>

If you're talking about the area behind the front passenger seat, I had
exactly the same problem.  Mine was leaking from around the rear hatch gasket
and dripping behind the side panel, under the carpet over the side wheel well,
under the seat and collecting in the wonderfully-designed reservoir behind the
passenger seat.  That sucker can hold ALOT of water!  Try SilGlide on the
gasket before you give in to replace it . . . . it worked for me.  Also, after
you sop up most of the water with towels, use a hair dryer to get the carpet
good and dry so it won't mildew.

Good Luck,
