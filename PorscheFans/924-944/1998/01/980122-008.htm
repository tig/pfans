Just wondering.......after reading the 944 FAQ, there's this little
section in which it talks of removing a small plug from a hole on the
side of the Bosch DME module and adjusting a small pot w/ 8 indents.
This adjustment supposedly adjusts the fuel enrichment (0, +3, +6 or -3)
 and the spark timing (either standard mapping or -3 degrees). Has
anyone out there dabbled w/ this? I want to try out some of the
different settings to see if there is a difference. My DME box has the
Bosch label w/ part nr 944.618.121.03 and a second blurb of nrs 0 261
200 076. It contains a stock chip. Yes, I know that this box is fm the
'85 to '89 series Motronic system and is outfitted into an '83 944na.
Don't ask me how it was done because apparently the mechanic or whoever
worked on the car when it was owned by the PO must have did this. I'll
tell you this much......the cable harnesses aren't neatly done. A good
bit of splicing and some dangling spurs was found. The engine is pretty
much stock all over but I did add a Lucas Sport coil (40kv output),
Bosch Platinum spark plugs set at 0.8mm. Here's another interesting
note: the label on the inside of the engine compartment bay behind the
divider wall that contains the VIN of WP0AA0944DN451299 states that the
date of manufacture is 5/82. Do mean to tell me that even though that
this is a 1983 model, it was manufactured a whole year before in May of
1982???? It just boggles the mind!

Right now, I'm in the process of getting new tie rod ends. The steering
response is lagging and has a wee little play as well as steering wheel
vibration anywhere fm 55 to 65 MPH. Yes, the wheels are computer high
speed balanced and the tires are HR rated mounted onto Cookie Cutters. I
also ordered a new oil pressure sensor since I read not too long ago
from someone else that when this sensor goes bad, the needle will peg
out the moment the ignition key is inserted. I'll also soon get my
timing and balance shaft belts replaced and tensioned. Then, that
dreaded clutch is hinting to me that it will need replacing. The
shifting is met w/ a minute kickback when engaging some gears when in
normal travel and the tell-tale clunking sound when disengaging and
engaging the clutch pedal. I recently had to replace the slave cylinder
at the bell housing and made very sure that all air bubbles were bled
out. I did verify that the pivoting arm traveled sufficiently for good
clutch operation throught the inspection hole but I did not measure and
compare the travel distance from rest and disengaging. Then again, I've
heard that the clutch doesn't necessarily need to be worn to justify
replacement -- it's simply that rubber centered puck that's gone bad.

Anyway, I'd appreciate if you all could give me some response on the
topic of DME settings and which and why that setting suited you. Thanks
in advance.
