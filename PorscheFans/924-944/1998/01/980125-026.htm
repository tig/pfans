You should be able to see the bolt from underneath the front of the car.  If
you look up from about where the driver side tie rods are, and follow the
engine mount up to the engine you should see it attached to the engine mount.
 The bolt is a rather long one (if I remember correctly it is about 6 inches
long).

The only thing I can think of that would get in the way would be the heat
shield over the steering u-joint.

To remove the bolt, I had to loosened the steering pump and pushed it out of
the way to I could fit a 6mm allen head bit on a long wobbler extension.  Be
very careful not to strip the bolt.

Sometimes, small things come in big packages but
  once in awhile, a big thing is crammed in to a
    small package, and the package breaks.
