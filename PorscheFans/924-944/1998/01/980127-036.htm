Well gang, I just got off the phone with the Midwest Region Manager for
PCNA.  It looks like I won't be spending as much time at the show this year
as in years past.  PCNA has basically mandated that only "Certified"
Porsche people will be actually working the display.  Because of the
introduction of the new 996, they don't want anyone getting "mixed"
signals/information, so I will only go there 2 times at most (probably one
day of each weekend).  I will try to post to this list the exact days when
I have figured that out.  Whichever days I do go to hang around, I will
proudly wear my Pfans shirt.

In my conversation with the Judd (the Manager), he told me he just returned
from the U.S. dealer introduction to the 996 at Atlanta Motor Speedway,
where they used the short 1-mile infield road course to check out the cars.
Although he said it rained the whole time he was there, the cars performed
wonderfully, and all of the dealers who arrived there with many
reservations about the car left with a whole new outlook and perspective.
Judd claims that the 996 is a real "winner", and didn't lose any of its
heritage, but only improved upon it.

At the Chicago show this year, there will be 3 Euro 996s and 3 Boxsters,
but nothing out of the museum.  Also, the display area will be larger and
in the middle of the hall, near M-B, rather than stuck back in a corner
like last year.
