Hi Joel,

I also use ATE fluid, and SS lines. I don't have a cool brake kit,
just larger than stock brake ducts. I do use PFC pads. Yes, they
can be tough on the rotors, but they work great. I remove the PFC 
pads for street use, installing MetalMasters for that. That helps
to save the rotors, as I've found the PCFC pads aren't that bad
for the rotors if they are only used on the track. I think they
REALLY need to be hot to work well.

I've never had a problem with soft pedal since I changed to ATE
fluid. Before, with Castrol GT LMA fluid, I used to get a soft
pedal, and I think I was boiling the fluid. With ATE, no problem.

I can't really add more than Jerry's comments on Over Braker's
Anon. I was definately a member. Now, unless I'm in a club race,
I give up the last few 10th's of a second lap time. That makes
the equipment last a whole lot longer. The surprising thing is
that sometimes, by trying to be smoother and slower, my lap times
are even faster! The whole concept of being smooth and easy for
fast times is the truth! 

I remember when I was still using MetalMaster pads at Bridgehampton.
If I tried to go as fast as I could, I would wear out a set of pads
in *1* day. If I relaxed, and went 1 second a lap slower, the pads
would last *3* days (and the tires lasted longer too). So, getting
that last second REALLY caused wear to skyrocket. I'm sure that I
was overbraking. Now I really try to be smooth ALL the time.
