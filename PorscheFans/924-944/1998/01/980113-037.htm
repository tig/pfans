Roxanne,
  If you give me more details as to what your locking system does, and doesn't 
do, I can help you pinpoint the problem.

  When locking and unlocking the doors with the key, does the electric locking 
system respond? When working correctly, the key only needs to be turned 
slightly before the electric locking system does the rest of the work. If not 
working correctly, you will have to turn the key further to lock and unlock 
manually. Do both doors respond the same? If the electric locking system 
responds, but the doors are not locked or unlocked by the system, then your 
problem is most likely the plastic arm that connects the servo to the locking 
mechanism with a plastic ball joint that often fails. If you remove the door 
panels, this is readily apparent. Let me know, and I can give you the P/N's 
for these inexpensive items.

  Now onto the central locking switch. When testing, have the ignition key in 
the on position, and both doors shut (the drivers side door does not lock and 
unlock when open to help prevent locking keys in the car). You say the light 
on the switch goes on and off? Do the lock knobs move up and down at all? If 
the above plastic arms are broken or disconnected, you will hear them, but the 
manual locking knobs will not move up or down. If you are having a problem 
with the servo position switches, the locking system will lock and then unlock 
the doors when you depress the central locking switch. This may seem strange, 
but the system is actually designed to work as follows: If one door is locked 
and one is unlocked, and the central locking switch is depressed, both doors 
will be unlocked. If the central locking switch is depressed again, the doors 
will lock. The switch which senses if a door is locked or unlocked is within 
the plastic casing of the servo. If this switch is totally defective and stuck 
in the locked or unlocked position, the locking system acts as designed and 
tries to synchronize the locks. These switches can also act intermittently. 
This will cause problems for both the central locking system and exterior 
locking and unlocking of the doors with a key. The fix for this can be as 
simple as adjustment of the servo's position with reference to the locking 
mechanism, or complete replacement of the servo in one or both doors. If these 
are your symptoms, let me know and I can give you more details on adjusting it.
 
 If you give me as much detail as possible as to the operation of your system, 
I can give you a better answer.

Good Luck,
 Ezra
