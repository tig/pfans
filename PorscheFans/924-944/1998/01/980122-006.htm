Tom,
      As Chris pointed out, the sleeves we discussed are actually aluminum
liners for the aluminum cylinders. If a block has to be bored, there are
several options. A steel/cast iron sleeve can be installed, the cylinder
walls can be resiliconized, or the aluminum liner can be replaced. I was
unaware that the aluminum liners could be replaced but, this is what Chris
is having done to his block (correct me if I'm wrong Chris). On my block,
the cylinder walls had a small ridge that I didn't feel comfortable with
(I'm building a 2.8L). My machinist gave me the option of boring the
cylinder walls and resiliconizing or boring and installing a cast iron
sleeve. He recommended resiliconizing (because is provides a harder surface
than cast iron) so, that's what I decided to go with. My cylinder walls
were bored from 100mm to 100.05 mm (enough to clean up the ridge). The
resiliconizing process is a three step lapping process that is detailed in
the 944 shop manual. There are three sets of stones that have to be used to
perform the process. The first two sets of stones actually prepare the
cylinder walls and the last are felt pads which apply the silicon compound
to the walls. I believe the stones and compound addressed in the shop
manual are made by Sunnen. If the cylinder walls of a 2.5L block which
normally has a bore of 100mm needs to be bored to say 104mm,  a cast iron
sleeve must be installed. The boring completely removes the aluminum liner
and part of the cylinder wall itself. The sleeve must be used because the
cylinder wall thickness gets too thin to provide sufficient strength. This
is normally only done when someone is trying to turn a 2.5L into a 3.0L.
Boring a 2.5L block and sleeving to 104mm is about the limit of what can be
done with that block.  As Chris and I discussed earlier (and Jim Pasha
confirmed) the 2.7L and 3.0L blocks were cast for 104mm bore cylinders so,
cast iron sleeves were not required.
