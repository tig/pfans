The directions on the Techron bottle say that you must put it
in the gas tank when it's nearly empty, and then fill the tank
with at least 12 (?) gallons of gas, presumably to mix the  
solution well.   

So, I would suggest that you re-try your experiment using Techron 
diluted with gas over a longer period of time, and perhaps compare
the results against a gas-only solution.
