Fellow Porschefans.

No this isn't spam. I don't own stock in the company. But I do love =
their rust repair products. Anyone heard of Por 15? I used their repair =
kit  to fix the rust under my 924's battery tray, came out really nice. =
It's been two years now, and the rust
isn't coming back...


First I sand blasted the rusty area on the car. (My battery tray)

Then I used something Por-15 calls Metal-Ready. It's a chemical that =
removes the old rusted metal, and  etches the metal with a coating of =
zinc phosphate so that the new paint will stick.

Then I used the Por-15 paint. Which has a super hard chip resistant =
paint.

Then I top coated it with  automotive primer and paint. It turned out =
really good.

You don't have to use Por-15. Go to a local automotive paint store they =
usually carry a professional grade product that will remove the rust.

If you have metal rusted though, please don't just bondo up a Porsche! =
You have a nice car, spend the extra money to have new metal mig wielded =
in.The secret to  rust repair work, is to protect the back of the =
repair. Use a good grade of zinc primer,  or epoxy primer the metal, =
then under coat the back side of the repair. Do it right, and it'll last =
more than two years.=20

An old body man, who taught me how to work on cars, told me. " If air =
can't get to the metal, it won't rust". I don't know how true this is =
but, I only  have to repair the rust spot once, and I live in Michigan. =
(heart of the rust belt).=20

Just my two cents....
