Everyone and Roxanne,

I have a few issues I am curious about:

1.  Where can I get Magnecor wires and the Lucas coil that I have seen 
threads on?

2.  I saw a thread earlier on a 'whoosh' upon opening the gas cap on 
your car.  What was the solution?

3.  I was under my car a few days ago, and noticed that the transmission 
had the casting for the electronic speedometer used in the 85.5 and 
later cars.  Any way to retrofit this to the earlier cars?

4.  Could the 6 speed tranny from the 968 series be used in the earlier 
cars?

5.  Is it possible to retrofit the belt tensioner from the newer cars to 
my 84 944?

Thanks for all of your help everyone!

Michael

Lee C. Archie writes in an earlier post:

<<Has anyone experienced deterioration of fuel lines after using Wurth valve
cleaner or Techtron Fuel System Cleaner?>>

Yes, the active ingredient in Techron is extremely hard on rubber and/or
plastic  fuel system components. It will actually dissolve fuel tank coatings,
older rubber hoses, and certain glues used in fuel filter manufacture. Even
the bottle this stuff comes in is a special "barrier" bottle. Most newer cars
have fuel system components resistant to attack by techron and other similar
fuel additives, but you still need to be careful and follow the additive
directions.

How do I know this? The company I work for develops oil/fuel products. One day
as I was helping myself to this product, our senior chemist advised me that
overuse of products containing "Techron"  will (not might) result in fuel
system damage as outlined above.   
  
>>On the next tank of gas, since I was unable to
get high octane fuel several times on the trip, I ran Techtron Fuel System
Cleaner through the system.<<

Techron actually LOWERS the octane rating of a given fuel. 

Jacking points: I have been using the center jacking point on the late 944's
for years with no ill affects. I bought the jack pad that Automotion (JP780)
sells and modified it as follows: I welded a 3" piece of 1" bar stock to the
underside of the pad. Think of this modification as adding the tail to the
letter "T". The tail now fits in the receptacle formerly occupied by the
original jacking saddle that came with the jack.

This modification enables me to remove the original jacking saddle, and
replace it with my modified JP780. With this setup, I have a positive and safe
connection to the 944 jacking point though the small pin on the JP780, while
the pad is secured to the jack with the 3" bar stock much the same as the
original jacking pad was. 

This setup makes tire changes a breeze, and provides a easy way to lift  the
car for service.
