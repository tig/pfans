> I've always wondered how instructors have the patience and courage to go

Sometimes it's easy, sometimes....

I haven't been instructing all that long, but I've only been really
scared by 1 driver. This was a young kid, part of a father - son team
that was driving a well modified 951 at Bridgehampton. The kid drove
first, while the father worked a flag station. The kid was a pretty 
good driver, good car control, good instincts. His line was consistant,
he was probably at about 75% of capacity. I asked him if he wanted to
go faster, and (surprise surprise, he did).  

So I started him working on some excerises to improve his speed down
the hill at the end of the front straight. For those of you who don't
know Bridgehampton, the front straight ends in a hill that makes first
a gentle right, then a sharper right. The key to being fast down the
hill is to be on the throttle. That transfers weight to the rear wheels
and makes the car feel stable. If you chicken out and lift, or don't
stay HARD on the throttle,  the weight comes off the rear wheels, they 
get light and the back end feels real squirelly. 

Most inexperienced people at Bridgehampton fly down the straight
and then sort of tip toe through the first few turns because they
don't know that if you use a little braking BEFORE the straight ends,
you can stay on the power down the hill. My student was one those
people. So I explain what I want him to do, he starts doing it
(slowly at first, going down the hill slower, but on the power
instead of coasting), and his lap times drop nicely. He does that
for awhile, starts going faster and faster, then I guess he scared
himself because he lifted while going down the hill. That scared 
ME big time, because I thought we were going to wreck big time. 
The car slid back and forth a while, then the kid gathered it up.
That was the end of his lesson on the hill for that day.

Later, when it was the father's turn to drive, he put the car well
up into the sand at the exit of turn 5. I think he got so excited
from watching the kid that he didn't give himself enough time to
warm up. He didn't really damage the car, just filled it with about
500 lbs of Bridgehampton sand!

Another good tool that's safer is to take the student for a ride. 
I can tell someone 10 times what I want them to do, but 1 ride
with me, and I can SHOW them where the car should be. Of course
you have to make sure the student understands the difference between
what you can do in your car and what they can do in their car.
I know a few people who, when novices, went with instructors
and promptly wrecked the next session.
