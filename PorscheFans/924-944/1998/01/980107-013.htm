Every tire thread I see completely ignores what I think is possibly the 
best value tire currently available.  The Firestone Firehawk SZ50.  I have 
run most brands of tires and the SZ50 wins IMO by being a great all around 
tire that is reasonable priced.  I have used them on both the street and 
the track.  Well known Porsche drivers like Peter Dawe and Kim Crumb have 
even been impressed with them.  My set of 215/45/17 front and 255/40/17 
rear from Tire Rack cost (w/shipping) <$650.  It is rumored the SZ50 is 
essentially a Bridgestone SO-2 with a different tread pattern.
