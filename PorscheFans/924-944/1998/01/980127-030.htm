Charles Godwin recently complained about water in his driver's side floor pan.
Well, Charles, welcome to the world of 944 fishtanks.

My '83 944 had a similar problem only BEHIND the passenger's seat. Everyone
said the sunroof seal. Changed that and I still got water behind the seat. It
was awful, because after the rain when the sun came out and started "warming"
the car up, the moisture condensed on the windows like a greenhouse.

Not long ago, I was reading the Porschefans archives from way back and found
someone posting about the same problem. Here's what they discovered.

Notice that when you wet the car from above, you can't see water coming in
from anywhere. Well, that's just it. It's not. The water SEEPS THROUGH A TINY
CRACK IN THE FLOOR PAN. You can prove this by driving the car over a wet
surface (pelting rain will work). As you drive, the floor becomes wetter and
wetter and wetter.

The guy who posted in the archive solved the problem by lifting the carpet and
holding a light under the car in a dark garage to find the crack. He then
found a TINY crack and sealed it with caulking compound. As simple as that. I
recently had my car at the dealer's collision center for some minor body work
(tail light and scratched bumper endcap) and asked them to look for a crack in
the floorpan. They couldn't find anything, (I doubt they did the light thing)
so they undercoated the entire car. I'm hoping this will work. Otherwise, I'm
going to have to look for it myself, and I have no idea how to lift the
carpeting. The thought just gives me the creeps...

Another interesting fix. My gas mileage dropped dramatically and the mechanic
found the oxygen sensor (14+ years old) to be dead. He replaced it and mileage
seems to have improved.
Good luck fishing for the crack, George.
