>>>Hey P-Fans, I need your input...

>>>Which Porsche 924/944/968 models would you consider to be most
>>>historically
>>>significant?

i think ill jump on that limb a little. the early 944 body , if you recall was
introduced in 1979 at the franfurt auto show as the 924 Carrera GT. at the
time it was considered a natural evolution of the 924 body and used technology
that combined both 924 and 928 engineering and the necessity to use wider
tires for racing purposes. the normal 924 did not meet its demise until 1982
in the usa and 1985 in europe, however the body was revived in the 924S model
until 1988.  i believe it was in 1980 , when preparing for le mans that the
original 944 drivetrain was introduced, in, again ,a car designated as a 924
carrera GTP.
so it is my conclusion that the early 944 did not "save" the line , it simply
improved it. there is no doubt the 924 evolution to 944 served to bolster
falling sales , however if we are talking about significant water cooled
porsches here, you must include the early 924 carrera line of racing
prototypes and limited production cars.

just my .02

<< 
 What are decent bras for the 944 NA front end?  I was over at
 Automotion today and looked at the one they offer.  It
 solves a lot of the problems that the bra I had many moons
 ago suffered from. >>

Walt,

I got a Colgan bra from Automotion and it is a great fit.  The best thing is
to let it sit in the sun for about an hour on a hot day.  Then carefully
stretch the warm bra over the front end making sure it remains centered and
comes to the edges of the body panels.  I used a pair of pliers to carefully
bend the metal tabs and the bra molds itself to the body panels.  Take your
time and you will get a good fit.  Just remember to take it off when it rains
and clean and dry it off well before replacing it.
