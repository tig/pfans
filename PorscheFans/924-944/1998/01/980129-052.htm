My '84 944 had two of your three problems at about 90,000 miles.

1. Intermittent/dead Cruise control: No fix, get a used cruise brain.
Remember they changed the brain in 85.5, you need to find an example of
the '84 brain that still works. This is not easy -- I went through three
used brains that did not work before finding one that does. According to
the dealer '84 cruise brains are not made/rebuilt by Bosch any more.

2. Warm-weather Tachometer: Exact same symptoms. I lived with the
dash-thumping/warm-day tach for a while. Tried taking it apart, checking
ground, speed signal -- the instrument was receiving all the correct
info. New tach fixed the problem.

Never had the steering-rack leak, going on 106,000 miles. The pump is
real noisy, but no leaks and no performance problems. Also no electrical
problems, leaks or bad grounds. Recently I left the car in 10F temps for
3.5 weeks with the battery connected, came back and started right up. My
car draws less than 6 milliamps with the security system armed.
