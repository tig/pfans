Save the goldfish for your 70's revival shoes. Buy a new or good used taillight
assembly (approximately US$40 - US$70) and properly seal it to the body. If you
don't want to spend the money for that solution drill a couple of small holes
at the bottom of each compartment in the old assembly and let it drain.

Rain gutters are of course optional.
