You guys all lead deprived lives!  If you, too, owned the pinnacle of
automotive engineering and a clearly superior car, the 944S, you would not
have any such problems.  The nozzle never fell out of my car during the
2.5 years that I owned it or looked like it was going to.

OK, OK, the 944S is a superior car, but in St. Louis, Missouri we have a
hose that is shaped like accordion bellows around the nozzle to recover
gas vapors so they will not escape to the atmosphere.  They seem to exert
force against the car at such an angle that they "lock" the nozzle to the
side of the vehicle.  These nozzles will not fall off the car no matter
what you do with them.
