Well, I can offer some commentary on the only spin I've done in my '84
944, and how it taught me about the car's handling. This happened about
a year after I purchased the car -- stock suspension/ride height,
somewhat worn Nitto tires (since replaced.) Road was standard asphalt,
in good condition, and the weather was cold and somewhat foggy.

I was exiting my neighborhood (25 mph street), going about 15, turning
left onto a major street (40 mph), thankfully empty at the time. For the
first time that I could ever remember, I caught the light on a green.
Enter the turn normally, pass the apex, ease on to the throttle, and
WHAT THE HELL? the rear starts to slide out to the right. Make one quick
correction on the wheel, and simply manage to reverse the direction that
I was sliding. Give up. Car spins around twice - I chose to do my best
to tighten the turns up (steering into it) to keep the car inbetween the
median and the curb on this three-lane street. Didn't smack either the
curb or the median at all, no damage to the car.

What did I find was the cause? ICE. After safely parking in a nearby
lot, I walked out to the point in the road where I felt the rears slip -
it had a small coating of ice on it. Don't ask me why, but I sure didn't
see it. Moral of the story - Don't trust the roads to be clear, be
careful about overcorrecting. In retrospect, if I had gently pushed it
back into line rather than trying to "snap" it back in, I might have
done better.

Alex.
