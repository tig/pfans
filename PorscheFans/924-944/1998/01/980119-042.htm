Well, Pfans, I at last got up off my "duff" and took the 968 out for a
little drive yesterday.  PCA Chicago Region had its annual "General
Membership Meeting" at a restaurant in one of the western suburbs.  The air
was fairly cold (would have been really great for a turbo), but the
important thing was that the streets were DRY.  At least a bunch of the
members finally got a chance to see my car.....and, surprisingly enough,
almost all of them were very impressed at the condition of my 96,000 mile
ride.  I managed to triple the miles I put on it since I got it (up to 130
now).  Still, however, no hard-use mileage, so my signature line will
remain unchanged.

BTW, the PorscheFans shirt was a BIG hit yesterday.  I probably could have
sold 30-40 of them if they were a ready commodity.  Anyone who didn't get
in on this deal will be mighty disappointed.......too bad.
