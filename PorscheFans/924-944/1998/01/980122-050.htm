Thanks for the input, Chris.  I should have been more precise about the
feel.  When I said smoothly, I meant that I had feel a slight shudder
indicating ABS function.  On my particular car ( I'll bet it varies), the
heavy ABS grabbing doesn't occur until I drop to about 60 mph.  If I'm
still very heavy on the brakes, the ABS feels like it wants to snap the
control arms off, so I've learned to modulate braking as speed drops. 
Sometimes, however, the braking at higher speeds is very  jerky, even w/out
the pedal to the floor.  On these occasions, I've even had track
instructors make comments about warped rotors.  

Anyway, I suppose you're right about the ABS being OK, but what makes me
nervous is that its behavior is not consistent, even when I've made an
effort to make sure tha test conditions were similar (i.e., certain amount
of time driving and a certain number of prior braking cycles).

Hi,
I got two questions:  I have a 1984 944 and am going to autocross the car with
the 15"x7" stock wheels and am wondering which tire size and brand (Kumho or
BFG) are the best to use for traction and performance.  Question number 2:
When the car is cold, randomly the fuel feels like it cuts out during a full
throttle acceleration.  The fuel cuts off for just an instant and it is too
random to give a good diagnosis.  It happens maybe once a week and it is a
daily car.  It happens only when it is really cold outside or the car has not
been driven for a while.  I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions.
Thanks in advance for any advice for both situations.
