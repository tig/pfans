Well, I've contacted CB Performance re: their 4lug rear disc brake
conversion kit (as previously posted). The appropriate type of kit to
match the 924's Super-Beetle rear drums would be the IRS-type kit, of
which there are two: catalog # 4198, which somes with a parking brake
cable, and # 4272, which is the competition version which has no
provision for a parking brake cable (that's the only difference between
the two kits).

The prices I received over the phone were $499.95 for the street kit
(4198, w/ parking brake), and $392 for the comp kit (4272, no parking
brake).  

The kit has the following components (I believe): rotors (solid), calipers,
hubs, caliper mounts (bolts onto the hub carrier) w/ bolts, asst'd seals,
and parking brake cable (if you bought the street kit), and pads. It's street
legal in 50 states. The pads are supposedly from some production car,
though they wouldn't specify what (not allowed to). However, they did
tell me that the competition calipers are 914 front calipers...

As a sidebar, Automotion (just picked for an example) sells rebuilt 914
rear calipers for $149.98 each (either side). If you wanted to create this
yourself, you'd just need to also buy the seals (which ones?) & rotors
(~$55 from Automotion) and pads (price depending on type), fabricate a
mounting plate, and figure out what to do about hubs (the stock ones
may be fine...). Depends on how much work you want to do...

They will not guarantee the cable to be the right length, due to the
application, and they already know that the cable supplied with the kit
does not fit Karmann Ghias and Squarebacks, due to the length.

They are located in California (in case you were wondering about
shipping).

I am not associated with either of these companies (CB Performance or
Automotion) and am not receiving any benefit for posting this info; I am
posting it only for those 924 owners who are interested in such a
conversion (myself being one of those - but don't ask me how it went, I
can't afford to do it yet!).

They can be reached at: 1-800-274-8337 - call them, not me, this is all I
know!
