          I was told at the Porsche Zentrum in Berlin that the posible 
cause for the vibrations is the balance shaft, it could be that it was 
install incorrectly when the water pump was done. They offered to do it 
for a mere 200 DM (120$). How do I get this fixed?
         My second question is how to adjust the hand break. Thanks in 
advance, and greetings from Cold and Wet Berlin!

P.C.

<< Did you have the Yellow Koni Sport struts that you have to remove before
you
 can change the rebound rate?
 
 Sounds like a good deal for the kit. I think I might go for it also (if it
 fits with the above struts). >>

No, I have the adjustment knob on the top.  They can give you a collar w/
inside diameter to fit your strut.  I actually told them the wrong size, and
when it didn't fit, they sent the correct size to me asap, even before I sent
the others back!  Good business on thier part.
