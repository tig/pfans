	I had a similar problem with mine, but Ray at AutoSports in Fairfax,
VA, opened the brain up and cleaned the boards and contacts with some Bosh
cleaner for the job and now it is fine. You could have corrosions on the
connector etc..

	One of our members is parting out a 86-944 and maybe he can give you
a deal on the brain if you need it. (SV056@aol.com ), there is another
member Jason Lee out of Fl, who advertised a bunch of stuff last week, who
had a brain, But I had a very disappointing dealing with him in the past and
would not recommend that path.

	Hello Fellow Waterpumpers:

	Last Saturday when I was driving my 1988 924S, it cut out altogether
three
	times, for about 2-4 seconds.  I stayed in gear, and power returned
normal
	each time.  I figured water in the gas and Sunday added some Drygas
and took a
	ride.  After about a mile, it cut out and I had to coast to the
shoulder and
	restart.  After that, it was fine for about 15 minutes, then it cut
out again,
	and this time would not start, leaving me stranded.  I had it towed
to my
	mechanic, who has had it now for a week.  He has checked numerous
things,
	including the obvious fuel system and coil, and replaced a rusted
flywheel
	sensor as well, which turned out not to be the problem.  After
determining it
	was a wiring problem, he traced it to the so called brain by getting
the car
	running and tapping on the brain.  He says it only runs when you tap
on the
	brain (is that DME or DEE?), and suggests I need a new one (please -
no pun
	intended).  He says that new they run about $1100.00, but you can
buy them
	rebuilt or used with a trade-in for as little as $400.00 or so, and
suggests I
	might be able to find one cheaper than he can, and should start
looking.  With
	this in mind, I have a few questions for you all:

	1.  Does this diagnosis sound logical?
	2.  Can a existing "brain" be serviced by anyone?
	3.  Where might you suggest would be the best places to call to get
a brain?

	All responses welcome and appreciated.  Please respond to me if
possible so I
	get it sooner than the digest arrives.
