Dennis:

My seat-of-the-pants speeds in each gear at readline (6750) are as follows:

1st: 42  2nd: 65  3rd: 87  4th: 110

as to 5th and 6th I can only say I have hit 136 in 5th going into turn 1 at 
BIR and I know I have rpm left.  The 136 number came from my Hot Lap which 
is calibrated to the track tires and I download after each run session.  As 
to 6th, I have to believe the factory and their number of 156 which is 
supposed to hit right at redline according to the material I have read.

Actually my question was aimed more at how do you derive theoretical speeds 
at a given rpm in a given gear.  I would like to learn the mathematical 
process/equation.

Oh, Oh. I've been found out!! To be honest, I didn't have a road test data
for the 968 so I "calculated" based on the percentage of difference between
the 3 known ratios and the 2 known speeds. It would sure be helpful if you
or anyone has access to "real", accurate road test numbers.

John Christensen had data on the 3:38 which was different than posted by 
R&T
and it appears the R&T info is NOT accurate. Obviously, this would then
effect my estimated 968 data. With corrected 3.38 data from John's info and
the Owners Manual for verification, the following is now submitted for 
"peer
review":

Corrected speeds in each gear @6400rpm:

968 --  1st: 35  2nd: 60  3rd: 83  4th: 103  5th: 129  6th: 155
3.38 -- 1st: 39  2nd: 67  3rd: 98  4th: 133  5th: 162
3.89 -- 1st: 33  2nd: 56  3rd: 83  4th: 113  5th: 140

If this straightens out the data, what's everyone's thoughts on the 
choices.
Which of these alternatives is "best", for what uses, and for what reasons?
