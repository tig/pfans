Hi P-fans!

I'm really curious about various problems with countersteering
I read in this list.
I do understand that 951 have more power and a very different
power band compared to my 944NA. But weight distribution is
almost the same and after stepping on the clutch to let the
wheels spin free it should behave almost the same.

Owning my car for almost 5 months now I never experienced a bad
situation although I like driving it hard. I had several slides
on wet streets and ice, 1 time on perfect dry road (way to fast
for that corner :-) and always had no problems whatsoever con-
trolling the car. I always had success at the first attempt 
setting the car straight again. I have to admit that I'm so
comfortable whith its handling that I eventually overpower my 
back wheels on purpose :-)

Knowing that I'm not such a good driver compared against people
whith lots of track experience (personally having none), I would 
like to know if tire sizes could be one of the reasons.

I am using stock size 215/60x15 on all 4 wheels, my snows are
195/65x15. I suppose that the wider tires do have more grip 
than the smaller ones, but when they break loose its much harder
to get things straight again.

Considering an update in spring to wider tires I really would
appreciate any input from listmembers who had gone through 
this update. Perhaps it would be safer for unexperienced 
drivers like me staying with stock size...

TIA

944NA sometimes sliding on purpose :-))
