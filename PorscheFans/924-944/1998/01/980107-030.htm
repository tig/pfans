     Well I have found that the reason I have no heat at idle is that the
     coolant level was indeed low. So now comes the next question. Why was
     it low. I'm not seeing any leaks, the oil is clean, there's no white
     smoke in the exhaust. (So I think the head gasket is ok)

     The car lost about 5 litres over the last 6 months so it's a small
     leak somewhere. Probably leaking onto the engine.

     Before I go through hours of searching has anybody noticed any obvious
     trouble spots for small leaks like this?

     -By the way, whoever posted that message on the rear defroster problem
     with the corroded fuse, -- Good Call. Mine had the same problem and I
     can see out the back window again. I hate those fuse panels...
