Jeff,
      Your thoughts on the battery mat are probably correct. I personally
think you're better off without them. The best protection for the battery
tray is the factory battery cover. It prevents acid from getting washed off
the battery by rain water (and while washing) and into the tray. I know
know this sounds rather simplistic but, I've seen more 944s that are
missing the factory battery cover than ones with the cover. After that,
it's a matter of cleaning the tray (with baking soda and water as you
already mentioned) and ensuring the drain from the tray flows freely. This
should be done at least once a year. As far as repair is concerned, there
are a number of options. I'm sure you've seen a number of them already
posted on the list. It sounds like yours is in the early stages (as mine
was). I first cleaned the area up as best I could (i.e. loose paint chips,
dirt, leaves, etc.). I then treated the area with a rust converter (the one
I used was made by Mar-Hyde).  Wear a pair of rubber gloves and make sure
not to get any of the rust converter on your skin or clothes. The converter
will turn the rust black (and anything else it gets on). Once it is dry,
coat the entire tray with a brushable seam sealer (I think 3M makes the one
I used). Once the seam sealer dries, it can be painted to the same color as
the rest of the car.  My tray had already started leaking when I did the
repair. I couldn't  find any holes but, apparently it was seeping through
the tray somehow. It has lasted for two years so far without any leaks.

Good Luck,
Clark Fletcher
