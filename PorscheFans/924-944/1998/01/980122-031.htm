Bill and pfolks,
I too am amazed at the car. Last week I had a real scare. This one scared=
 the bejeezes out of me but the car recovered in some way that I am not =
sure how happened. I had to take a detour home on a country road that I =
was not familiar with. It was dark, dry and the road was twisty but only =
fairly good condition so I was not pushing the car. I approached a modera=
te left hand curve at about 50 however I did not see the curve until I =
was at the apex! At the apex the road turned to crap so visibility of the=
 road was very poor. It was still paved but there was no centerline or =
sideline and gravel in the apex from a driveway. So as I hit this gravel =
I snapped the car to the left and the rear swung way out, off the road. =
It occured so fast I am not sure what I did with my feet. I think I clutc=
hed in but don't know about the throttle. Anyway the rear caught and coun=
tered to the left as much as it had slid to the right. By this time I was=
 in the opposite lane . A car was approaching from the other direction =
but saw my predicament and slowed. At this point the rear caught again =
and the car slowed and I drove away with nothing but a strained neck.

No question here just wanted to share my thrills. I think it has been dis=
cussed but it seems the 944 has much more inherent recovery from overstee=
r than other cars, which is basically what your saying as well. If I had =
been anticipating the curve of course there would have been no oversteer =
so I am very glad the car corrects well.
