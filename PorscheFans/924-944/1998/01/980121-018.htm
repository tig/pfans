     This may sound like a dumb question, but I wanted to see how big an 
     effect mileage has been on other's 944 experiences.  I'm currently 
     looking at an '83 that is going for a good price.  I was going to get 
     it checked out by a local Porsche shop and was just wondering if any 
     other readers had discovered particular problems on these early models 
     other than the obvious belt, clutch, and water pump.  
     
     The car was not upkept by a Porsche fanatic, but does have maintenance 
     records.  The belt was changed every 30k.  Mileage is about 108k on 
     the original engine and transaxle.  The owner reports the car has been 
     utterly reliable and he's never had any problems.  The car seems to 
     run strong and has no real rattles.  Oil pressure is about 2.5 at idle 
     and jumps to 4/5 once underway.  Transaxle seems to shift fine.  I 
     would expect to make minor modifications and refresh the interior, but 
     did want to avoid any major problems.  The car would be a daily 
     driver, and I would like to use it in an occasional driving event but 
     no competition.  Any experiences or hints on what to look for would be 
     appreciated.
     
     Thanks in advance for any help or hints,
