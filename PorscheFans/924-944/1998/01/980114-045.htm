Alright, it was a ADMIN system posting. So sue me. I just switched my int=
ernet access to a WIN 3.1 system and everythings going haywire. I cant =
tell when or what order in which y'alls(whew, that smells of the South =
don't it) postings come. Half the time I cant get mail to send.

Bob, I got lucky when I stumbled across my car, it's good to read from the
list and read about any future problems that may lie ahead for my car. Have
you ever called Porsche to see who the original dealer was for your car and
the options that it came with. Thats how I found out that I had a LSD in it. I
had an idea I had one, but it was nice to get it verified. I also thought it
was ironic that Farzan said that the average life of the bypass valve was
40000 miles, so I guess with the age and mileage on my car, it's a good winter
project.
