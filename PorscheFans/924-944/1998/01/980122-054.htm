Hello,
I just had to stick in my 2 cents worth. So...

The 924 Carrera GT took the 924 Turbo idea and added thne body flares
that became the 944 body. Until then the 924 was on a hiding to nowhere.
It was underpowered. It had a rough engine. It had the Audi turkey
factor. It didn't look aggressive enough on the road; pretty yes.

So this steroidal 924 was proved out. The package looked good. By
putting contra-rotating balancer shaftrs in the 4-cylinder block Porsche
got the smoothness. The wing (fender) flares added the hint of muscle to
the shape and the 944 was borne bringing respectability and then some to
the water-cooled front-engine range.

IMHO no 924 Carrera GT meant no 924 and no 968. A watershed crossing car
if ever there was one.
