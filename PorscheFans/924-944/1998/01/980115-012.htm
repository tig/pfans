In my experience the "100 MPH" tape does not have the staying power.
Go ahead with the upgrade of Girlfriend 1.0 to 1.2, but would suggest
that you don't install Girlfriend 1.2 on top of Girlfriend 1.0 as this can
cause even more noise problems. Also never install any version of 
Girlfriend in when your car when Wife 1.0 is present

Best Regards

Richard.
