This is BS, the cylinder walls are not coated with Teflon. They are
coated
with something called ALUSIL which is an aluminium/silicium (NOT
silicone)
compound.

A couple of days ago somebody posted a (very good) message which 
contained the web page from Kolbenschmidt AG (the company who made
the 944 blocks for Porsche). This site contains some excellent papers
on the materials and procedures used to make these blocks. The best
manufacturers of pistons and engine blocks in Germany (and probably the 
world) are Mahle and Kolbenschmidt. Porsche used pistons from both
companies in the 944 range. (BTW Kolben is german for piston)

O, btw, the 944 block does NOT contain liners (see Porsche specification

book 924S-944, $13.98 at Automotion).

Now my own thoughts on oil and additives:

Do NOT use additives.
Change the oil according to the manufacturers spec.
(maybe more often if you race the car)
Use the oil type prescribed by the manufacturer.
