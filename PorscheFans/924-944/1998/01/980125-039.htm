I would like to thank everyone who responded to my first post.

I have another question:

Has anyone seen an adapter for a floor jack to mate with the 944's jack 
points? I would like to raise the entire side of the car from the where 
the factory jack does using a floor jack. My floor jack has a plate which 
is entirely too large for this car. It would probably damage the chassis 
in some way! Or is there a better way? I have seen pictures of the 
production of the 944, and they held the car at the front and rear of the 
car at the round "sockets" on the underside of the car. That would seem 
like the best place to put jack stands?.....

I don't want screw up the under carriage of the car if I can help it. If 
anyone can help I would appreciate it!

Thanks again!
John
