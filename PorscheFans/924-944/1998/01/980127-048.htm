Folks,

It's time for me to jump into the recurring thread
on achieving more power in the various incarnations
of the NA 944.  Ole's posting from yesterday raised the
chip issue again

and it's been the consensus that chips do little for our NA cars.

Short of PowerHaus' turbo conversion on the 968 or S2 - which would
cost almost as much or more than many of us have invested in
our cars - I would expect something would help.

In particular, when I look under the hood of my S2, I'm
astounded by what appears to be a rather narrow
constriction comprised by the air flow meter and
throttle body.  Some time ago, I looked at the engine in an
Acura Integra R-Type, an engine with smaller
displacement than my S2 but with intake plumbing
substantially larger.

Are there any aftermarket parts to help my S2 breath more freely?

Thanks
