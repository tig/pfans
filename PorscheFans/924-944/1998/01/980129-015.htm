My '88 944 Turbo has undergone brain death also. About 2 months ago the
engine suddenly stopped when the car was cruising at 80mph. A rolling
restart got it going again before it had coasted to a stop. Five minutes
later it happened again. This time the car halted. Eventually it re-
started with the starter motor and was fine up until late December.

It repeated the second incident then and, a few miles later, died for
good.

The car had to be towed home.

In the garage they backtracked from spark plugs (no spark) to rotor
(weak spark) to coil (strong spark). The technician noticed that the RPM
gauge flickered when the started motor was turning. This plus a talk
with an auto-electrician indicated to him that the brain was dead.

He subsitituted a second-hand brain as a test and the engine started.

He tells me a Porsche new brain is 1,100 pounds sterling. He'll let me
have the secondhand one, gained by breaking up a 944 for parts, for 400
pounds sterling with a cash back warranty if it fails to perform
correctly over some time period.

Having read previous posts I'll recover the dead brain and see if it can
be resuscitated in a UK Turbo brain clinic - if one exists.

(A brain dead car. Sheesh! Usually it's the driver....)
