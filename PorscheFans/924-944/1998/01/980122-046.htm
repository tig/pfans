Kevin Gross kicked it off with:

* does anyone know what we are going to see at daytona rolex this year?

Another Kevin (the digest mailer chopped off the 'From' address) wrote:

<<I learned today that we are *not* going to see the GT1's there this 
year - major bummer.  They're not competitive with the other cars in 
GT1, and Porsche as usual will not support a series in which they 
cannot clean house.  The Rohr car was there for practice, but will not 
be there for the race.

There are also very few GT2 entries, so few that apparently they may be 
bumped to GT1.

Personal opinion: I wish the Factory would get their collective heads 
out of the sand.  These series don't want turbocharged cars, haven't 
for years, and have only let Porsche in with their damned turbos, 
handicapped, to fill the field and to take advantage of a famous marque 
in terms of its draw.  It's a normally aspirated, water cooled, 
multi-valved world outside of Zuffenhausen...>>

I disagree completely. Let's collectively thank Porsche for not
abandoning us to the vagaries of F1 and the SCCA. I _like_ turbo cars. I
_like_ Indycars.

David Jalai responded:

<<I talked to the ROHR guys yesterday, they are indeed going to the 24
hours. Who/where did you get your info from?  ROHR will be racing a
Factory GT-1 EVO. It is a new car from their last years GT-1
Yellow/Pirelli car.
 
Champion Porsche, in Florida will also be campaining a Porsche GT-1 car. 

Yes - I have seen the lap times from practice on the Jan 10th. The Panoz
cars were indeed 7-8 sec faster per lap! 

Panoz will have three cars for the 24 hours.

There will be also one BMW/Meclarean.>>

Let's not forget Daytona is a 24 hour endurance race where the average
winning margin is measured in dozens of laps. Let's not forget the
average race lap times are 20 seconds slower than qualifying times.
Let's not forget Porsche is the dominant car at Daytona in every class
in which it has competed and yet it rarely captures the pole. Let's not
forget Porsche has a habit of pulling factory efforts if it feels the
organizers are being unfair. It will be interesting to see if the
tortoise can once again catch the hare. I'd be willing to bet it can.

IMHO of course,

Paul Foster
