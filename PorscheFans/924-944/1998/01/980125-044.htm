I HAD A WATER LEAK IN MY REAR FOOT WELL ON THE RIGHT SIDE. FIRST I
LOOKED AT THE PROVEBERIAL BATTERY BOX --- IT LOOKED OK.

I BLEW OUT I.E.- CLEANED MY SUN ROOF DRAIN HOLES--- REPLACED MY SUN ROOF
SEAL. DID NOT STOP THE LEAK. I FINALLY PULLED UP ALL CARPETING ON THE
PASSENGER SIDE OF THE CAR AND FOUND THE LEAK. IT WAS LEAKING FROM THE
BATTERY BOX SMALL CRACKS IN THE THICK RUBBERY COATING. I USED FIBERGLASS
FILLER AND SPRAYED UNDERCOATING OVER THAT. THEN REPAINTED THE ENTIRE
AREA. THAT SOLVED MY WATER PROBLEM IN MY REAR PASSENGER FOOT WELL. THE
WATER WAS RUNNING UNDER THE SOUND PROFFING MATERIAL IN TO THE REAR AREA.

IN REGARD TO BEST PORSCHE. I USED TO BELONG TO THE TAMPA PCA - AFTER ONE
OF OUR OUT OF TOWN MEETINGS YEARS AGO TO CRYSTAL RIVER. WE ALL SAT
AROUND DRANK TOO MANY BEERS AND GOT TO THE PROVERBIAL SUBJECT OF WHAT IS
THE BEST PORSCHE -- THE CONCENSIS WAS THE TURBO 944-- BUT BEST WAS A 944
IF YOU TAKE INSURANCE COSTS ( ABOUT DOUBLE FOR A TURBO ) ETC. IN TO
ACCOUNT. 

QUESTION---

WILL THE HELLA 4 -- 7" HEADLIGHTS FIT AND PLUG INTO MY 83 944 HEADLIGHT
HARNESS ???

Dear P-fans,

I have a 1984 944na and I'm wondering what model of Blaupunkt radio was stock
for this car.  I have seen numerous references to the Reno and Houston models
on the list.  I have a Richmond model but I don't know if it was stock or the
PO changed to this one.  Can someone who has a 1984 model please tell me what
radio they have?  Also, I have no instruction booklet for the radio (I've had
to find some things out by experimentation . . . . . it took me about 2 months
to find that I had forward and reverse tape queing!) so if someone has a
Richmond model booklet I'd like to arrange for a copy and I'd gladly pay the
copying fee.

Thanks,

Rich Freitas  (FreitasRJ@aol.com)
