My symptoms started out with the fan not coming on when the temp. guage hit
the upper white mark (in fact, it went all the way to red). Turning the A/C
on forces the fan to come on, so when it started to creep up, I turned it
on. That worked for awhile, then the fans wouldn't turn off after the
ignition was turned off. The only way to stop the fans was to unplug the
fan relay. So, I bit the bullet and decided to replace the switch myself.

The procedure:

First, on a 951, forget about trying to do it from the top. It may be
possible, but at a minimum, a lot of plumbing has to come out of the way.

So, I did it from the bottom, and did it as follows:

1.  Disconnect negative terminal of battery (or, maybe better, remove the
fan relay).
2.  Jack car and place the front end on jack-stands.
3.  Remove the forward portion of the engine shroud, uncovering the area
beneath the radiator.
4.  At the very bottom of the radiator, on the driver's side, is a plastic
drain plug. Remove it to drain the radiator. Reinstall after it has drained.
5.  Above and to the left of the driver's side cooling fan is the switch.
Unplug the wire harness and move it aside.
6.  Using a 29mm, 1 1/8" socket, remove the switch. You do not have to
remove the cooling fan or the upper radiator hose. A long handle extension
for the socket is all you need.
7.  Replace the switch with the new one, making sure you use a new washer.
8.  Put everything back together, and refill the coolant tank.
9.  Then you must bleed the system. The bleeder screw is located
immediately inside and above the distributor, where the upper radiator hose
enters the block. The bleeder screw is on the side, facing the right
fender. Open the bleeder screw until you see the hole in the middle of the
screw. Turn heater on full blast. Start engine and let it warm up until the
cooling fans come on. Watch the bleeder screw and let it remain open until
no air is coming out. Tighten bleeder screw and top off coolant.

The hardest part of this job was removing and reinstalling the engine
shroud. The rest of it was a piece of cake.

Please note: The above procedure is for an '87 951. Whether it is the same
for other 951's, I don't know.

Thanks to all who responded to my original post with help and instructions.

Mike
