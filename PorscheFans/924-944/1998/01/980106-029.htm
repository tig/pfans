Problem is this.
After driving about an hour, particularly if in traffic it just dies.<

I had the same problem last year with my 84 944, right after I bought
it. I would leave for work in the morning (a 30-minute drive), and about
20 minutes later, EVERY DAY, it would die and leave me on the side of
the road. If I waited about 20 minutes without cranking it, it would
start right up, but die again about 20 minutes later, depending on how
long I had let it sit. It seemed to be worse in damp weather.

I checked everything I could think of, including the fuses. Several
mechanics had no idea about why this was happening. Finally one night
when I was stranded in a parking lot, about 5 minutes after the car had
died, the voice of God said, "TWIRL THE FUEL PUMP FUSE." So I did, and
sure enough I turned the key and the car roared to life. I drove home,
and the next day, when the light was better, I squeezed the fuse
contacts closer so that the fuse would be held tighter. Also, just for
the heck of it, I replaced all the fuses.

My favorite theory is that the fuel pump fuse, which was old but did not
appear broken, was just barely making contact with the fuse box. When
the car warmed up, the fuse contacts spread just enough to break contact
with the fuse. It also could be that there was some microscopic crack in
the fuse, and the crack widened when the car warmed up. Anyway, my
problem was solved. The car has never died since. Hope this helps.
