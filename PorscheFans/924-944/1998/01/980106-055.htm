No way.  The spikes are so small in comparison to the numbers the car is
generating.  A large spike on the dyno will be 2-5hp, about 0.7%-1.9% of
the peak HP of the car.

At first I thought it was normal on these cars because each and every turbo
I've driven has it, but David J mentioned that the CV joints may be dry and
need re-packing.  To test his theory, I am going to have mine re-packed on
thursday and will let the list know what happens.  Another excellent source
also told me that Porsche didn't use enough grease in the joints from the
factory which may be why all of the 944T's I've driven have that vibration.

We discovered it was not normal when Paul's car's vibration has increased
quite a bit since he's owned it.  If it was normal, it would not have
increased over time.  Sorry to have led the list to believe it was normal.
Good thing the list has open discussion to correct assumptions.

I have the drilled valve and have the vibration, but hopefully not after
Thursday!
