Hi Bob,

Oops, you're right.  That's what I get for pawing through my Pfans 
e-mail late at night.

The only issue going the other way might be the length of the 
transmission.  I think the AGx transmissions are a little longer, but 
could be mistaken.  They are certainly taller in some sections along 
the input and pinion shafts, due to the thicker gearsets and different 
bearings.  You will also have to update to the new transmission 
mounting parts - a centre/top bracket vs. two side brackets.

Kevin

In a message dated 98-01-27 21:21:29 EST, you write:

<< > I am considering to install a 1991 944S2 transmission in my 1988 
944
 (8V).
 >Are there any reasons why this would not work?

 Yeah, you'll tear the teeth off the pinion gear sooner or later,
 probably sooner.  >>

wouldn't this be the case if he put the '88 tranny in the S2 as opposed 
to
what he's considering?
