<<I know the "round sockets" look very tempting but they are NOT
jack-safe. They will go in and bend the undercarriage giving your
interior floor a nice tilt. After much painful experience I have
concluded that the 944 does not have a place on the undercarriage that
is safe to jack. You will see the designated jack points marked by the
little diamonds under each door on the rocker panels, but these will
also deform eventually. Besides lifting the car at those points makes
for a very unstable 944. Using a block of wood on the two undercarriage
"rails" works, but it eats away a little bit of undercoating every time.

I have been using the A-arm mounts and the rear shock mounts for a while
now and this seems to avoid mutilation while giving me the height and
stability I like.>>

I too have found this to be true. I believe the "round sockets" are used
to attach the car to the assembly line while it is being built. When I
was autocrossing my NA 944 I'd swap wheels as many as 30 times per year
and everything got bent over time. Now I usually jack the car from the
rear suspension frame located just behind the door. It balances the car
as well as the 'diamond spot' so you lift both ends the same amount and
it doesn't deform over time.  Jack stands can then be deployed at the
rear of the front suspension attachment points and at the end of the
torsion tubes in the rear.
