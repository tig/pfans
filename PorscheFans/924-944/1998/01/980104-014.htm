Try White-Allen and please mention my name (Marv De Beque (Debeck)).  I

mention it, you get 15% off list.

Alex,
I think you may be using the wrong jacking points for the factory jack.  There
are only two points for the factory jack -- one on each side near the middle
of the rocker panel.  The location is marked by a small arrowhead at the
bottom of the rocker panel.  Look underneath at that spot and you'll see where
the jack goes.  If you jack the car at that point, you lift both wheels on one
side at the same time.  

The four points you're talking about were the subject of much controversy on
the list a while back.  Many, including myself, have had bad experiences
jacking at those points  (eg, floorpan deflection, deformation of the point
you're jacking against).  Others apparently use those points without problems.
What I recall from that thread was that those jacking points were for original
assembly of the chassis,  although some speculated they're also appropriate
for raising the whole car on a lift.
