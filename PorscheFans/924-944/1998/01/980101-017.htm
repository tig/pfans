David, while I don't claim to be an expert on these, I do not think that
solid motor mounts will 'smooth out' over time.  The fluid that leaks out
of the stock mounts is essentially part of an internal hydraulic shock
absorber.  It is my understanding that these devices are intended to dampen
the relatively low frequency/high amplitude vibrations occurring at low
rpms.  Thus, I would not expect solid mounts to ever be capable of doing
the same job.  Even if they are rubber, what you have is essentially a
stiff spring but little damping to go with it.  Just my opinion.....
