Hey P-fans,
        For those who agree "better late than never" let me add my person=
al
experience to the a-arm thread. I've had TWO track failures. On my '84 94=
4
I had one of the steel ones fail uder braking going into turn seven at
Blackhawk Farms raceway. In this case it broke through the hole that
attached the sway bar. Believe it or not Porsche actually gave me a new
pair, although the car was way out of warranty. That VW part is worthless=

for racing.
        More recently I had the ball joint fail on my '89 951. This
happened under braking going into turn 5 at Road America. Fortunately it
broke late in the braking zone If it had happened earlier, they'd still b=
e
picking up the pieces because you're just about at a 951's terminal
velocity at that point. The ball joint failed at the groove that holds th=
e
pinch bolt. I now have Fabcar a-arms on this car.
        In both cases the failures caused some fender damage, but
fortunately nothing very serious. However, it surely could have been bad,=

and I for one must recommend the Fabcar arms/ball joints if you're gonna
track the car. My car is lowered somewhat.
        As a second point, I'll be at the Sebring Club Race (a.k.a. 48
hours of Sebring) all 3 days. I'd like to say hello to any other P-fans
going to that event. The car's white, I'm #37 in class E. Look for my bla=
ck
Suburban or red trailer. =
