Aloha & Happy New Year All!!

On my 1989 944S2

I noticed that my recirculation function of the AC/Heat system is no longer
working.  Outside air is brought into the cabin when switch is engaged.

Does anyone know how this system functions and how to trouble shoot it?  

The light in the switch comes on when the switch is engaged.  The uppermost
of two relays mounted to the left of the glove box "clicks" when the switch
is engaged.  All other functions of the AC/Heat system are functioning
normally.

Any help will be much appreciated.

	Sounds like your idle stabilizer is shot. With engine running, smack the idle
stabilizer with a H.D. screw driver. If the idle changes your idle stabilizer
is shot. The valve inside is sticking. Also do not for get to check the
obvious stuff, TPS throttle switch, air flow meter connector, and vacuum
leaks. 
			
					Good Luck, DavidJalai@aol.com



Subject: 944 Turbo Stalling



Can you please help? I have an 86 951 and for a few weeks when I would start
in the morning the idle would stumble and die on the first try, on restart the
car ran fine.the other day I was driving and getting a lot of hesitation and
the car wanting to stall. This morning I went out to start the car and it
started then died. When I restarted it the idle jumped fom about 800 rpm to
2000 then it settled into a very very lumpy idle and died. Same thing on
restart. Car starts and then idles like a tank and dies... Any ideas? 

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Ben

P.S. Please reposond to the list and to me at dmer@aol.com

.... The Ford Crown Vic=92s top out at 135 mph via a =93speed=0Alimiter=94=
