Over the years I have been a driving instructor for a variety of clubs,
PCA, SCCA, et. al. One very funny situation occured at a Time Trial
school at Laguna Seca a number of years ago. 

Prior to the relayout of the track, turn 4 (now turn 6) was at the end
of a very fast section of track. If you threaded the line very well,
turn 4 could be a place where you could carry a lot of speed and put
some distance on your competitors. I wll ad that many well-known drivers
have use some interesting and unsuccessful lines through this corner.
Some have had some interesting incidents as a result of being off line
or a little too hot into the corner.

At a Golden Gate Region time trial, a student approached me and asked if
I had had any incidents in turn 4. I asked why. He replied that a group
of senior instructors were standing around and comparing notes as to how
they had crashed at or in turn 4 and how badly their cars were damaged.
I asked why this concerned him. He stated that it would be more
beneficial to him to learn from the guy who hadn't crashed so he
wouldn't either. 

The moral of the stoy is thus: If you have been a big silly on the
track, don't talk about in front of your students. Part of the teaching
experience is to pass on the better aspects of your knowledge in hopes
that this will help a novice. 

He should have asked be about passing at turn 7.
