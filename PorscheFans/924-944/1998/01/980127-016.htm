I have the Kerkey Economy Racer mounted to the stock rails in my '77
924 - all I had to do was fabricate a couple of Al bars (2" wide, .5" thk,
about 20" wide I think) that bolted to the stock seat slider and the bottom
of the seat. The seat was too skinny to mount to the rails directly, and
would've sat too low. The bolts going through the seat bottom are Grade
8 .5" bolts, the rails are bolted in using the stock mounting bolts (weakest
link, I know).

In order to make it confortable for use for over 2 minutes, I added
spacers under the front edge of the seat to tilt it back - I'd recommend
going with the seat with the larger layback angle. I wish I could tilt it a
little more, but can't find long enough bolts for any larger spacers. I also
had to add additional padding (actually foam) under the seat cover in the
lumbar region for reduced fatigue - it's actually pretty comfortable now,
and I'd contemplate long trips in it. Fits like a glove, and it's a theft
deterrent - no-one else is skinny enough to fit in it!!!

Hi all,
Its time to replace this valve in my 83 944.  I cant control the dircetion of
the air much at all anymore.  Question--how difficult is this to get to and
what is the best procedure.  Any help would be much appreciated,
