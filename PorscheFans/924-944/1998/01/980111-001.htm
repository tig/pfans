 Hi Michael,
 maybe I was not clear. The problem is aquaplaning. If you run with them on
 a wet only track, OK, since you have not little "lakes" on it. I believe
 is a problem with the design of the tire, that not allows water to go out.
 But, it´s possible that we are talking about different things :-). Even if
 we was talking on the same reference, I believe that can exist different
 compounds, since my 690 are made in Spain and yours probably not. And,
 these appreciation are subjective.
