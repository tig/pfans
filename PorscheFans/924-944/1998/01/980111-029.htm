P-Fans,
This past summer while at a DE event, I walked back to my car after a run
session to find a pool of anti-freeze running away from it. As my car is a
turbo and it was just a pretty hard run (FTD, and for a water pumper!!), my
immediate thoughts went to head gasket. It wasn't. The hose for the heater
from the water pump had burst.
I was fortunate when a fellow 951 owner happened to have a spare and was
willing to share it!!! But during these winter months when so many of us
catch up on projects around the car, I thought I might share this experience
with everyone. I have now changed all the hoses and belts and feel quite
prepared (at least in this area) for next season.
If your car is more than 9 years old, it may be the preventive maintenance
that saves your track day or your next road trip from disappointment. By the
way, the burst hose was still soft, pliable and felt to be in good shape. I
found an entire set of hoses available from OG Racing. They are in Pano and
Excellence or have a web page at http://www.ogracing.com/ .

Fans,
I removed the oil cooler on my 88 Turbo S to make some repairs and I want to
be sure I don't miss anything putting it back together.  Any special cautions?
Any sealants or thread locking compounds required?  Other advice?  Thanks.

Hi Jim,
I appreciated your suggestion about not relating crash storeis.  A couple of
years ago at a performance driving school chalk talk we do on Friday night
prior to the track training, our main speaker (who had just driven Daytona)
told several colorful and entertaining stories about crashs there and other
places. 

At our debriefing the next week several of us recognized this was not the way
to introduce many of our students to performance driving.

Subject: Experience w/ Motorworks (San Diego)


Hi all,

Has anyone had any experience with Motorworks in San Diego?  I'm
considering sending my engine block to them so that can check and
hone the cylinders.

Everytime I've talked to them on the phone, they've come across as
being rude, which gives me doubts about using them.

Thanks!!

(oh, yea...does anyone know of other machine shops that can reapply
the silicon to the cylinders?)

chris

I can tell you that Motor Works has a more than excellent reputation here in
San Diego. I get into their shop regularly. As a matter of fact they just
magnafluxed my 356SC crankshalf, polished the crank, balanced the engine,
surfaced the flywheel.

I've known them for years. Most of the "good" Porsche independents around her
also use them for items that require "the right shop." Their prices are
sometimes a little more expensive but worth it.

If you want through their shop you're likely to see engines laying around from
a 300SL or some 30's car I've never heard of.

I could give you a list as long as my arm of PCA members here who've used them
for years. I believe they can nicasil 944 cylinders as well.

As far as their seeming rude on the phone. Well, it's probably the Italian
accents and being involved with Ferrari decades ago.... but that's just a
rumor.

Last year they had a 928 motor in there sent from a shop, well, I'd better not
say. I think Motor Works is a little known secret to some motor builders when
they need something never done before done right.

Well, the 924S is finally back together and running after lots of work. This
is the first time I have had this car running since I aquired it. While I had
lots of stuff out of the way, I replaced the right side engine mount as a
preventive, as I was not sure of the condition of the old one. The new one
kind of sloshed around a bit when shaken, so that I could hear that there was
both oil and some air in there. It seems quite rough at idle, but I am unsure
of weather this is due to the new mount or some idle related thing. Can the
liquid in a new mount normally be heard to slosh, or was this not filled
properly? It seems to smooth out with the slightest amount of throttle,
perhaps at less than 1200 rpm per the faq, but its hard to tell with the
factory tach, I will have to try it with an better tach. If the mounts are ok
like that, (provided its not the left side) anyone have any rough idle
suggestions. I have new wires, cap and rotor, which I will install tomorrow,
but I kinda doubt thats it. Also, the exhaust manifold for the 1 and 4
cylinders is cracking at the Y joint, non-bellowed steel pipe version. Whats
the best source for an upgrade, of should I just have it welded up again?
