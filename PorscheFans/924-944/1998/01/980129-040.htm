I purchased a 1987 - 944S late last fall and then too quickly had to
store it for the winter. I'm doing some planning now to correct a number
of nigglies for the start-up & rollout in the spring. If any one can
offer their advice, I would appreciate it....

1.  Oil pressure:  the gauge needle goes to 5 bar with the ignition key
to on, and remains there with the car started and running.  Faulty oil
pressure sender (repair by replacement)? Or something else?

2.  Power sunroof:  The sunroof caused no problems for the first while
until... the rear of the sunroof popped open several centimetres at the
trailing edge when at highway speed (needless to say, I quickly slowed &
stopped.) Then when trying to retract and lock the sunroof, there was a
nasty gnashing sound of gear teeth somewhere towards the  back (the roof
eventually did engage with the geared retractor arms, aka element
guides). Now I cannot get the roof to lift open at the rear edge
(although I can get the guides unengaged so I can unlock and remove the
sunroof).

A Porsche repair shop I talked to said it would probably not be worth
their effort & my dollars to fix the sunroof, and learn to live with it
as is (i.e., a manual sunroof). I really would like to have an operating
sunroof though.

Is this a achievable task for a do-it-yerselfer, or is the shop's advice
valid?  And if it is within my mechanical aptitude, where is the
suggested start point - luggage compartment / electric drive motor or
the roof section and the element guides & drives?

3.  The 15 inch phone dial wheels look pretty mangy (dull and splotchy
grey with "chipped" areas). I would like to have them restored at a
local shop as long as there is nothing wonderfully unique about the
wheels that is beyond "normal" shop knowledge and experience. Any advice
on restoring these wheels back to pristine ??

I have a fairly complete tool set (excepting those Porsche specialty
tools) and the factory repair & maintenance manuals.

Thanks,
