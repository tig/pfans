I did that once on a motorcycle (because the customer told me to).  I
warned him that the materlinked camchains had a bad reputation.  I told
him they were known to come apart just like the master links on our
drive chains sometimes do.  I informed him that my shop took NO
responsibility for the consequences of such a brave and possibly
shortsighted decision.  12 months that bike ran like a beast (tick,
tick).  12 months the customer smiled at his frugal decision (tick,
tick, tick).  12 months, nearly to the day, after delivering his freshly
gone through sportbike, the ticking time bomb reached zero and the
pistons, head, valves, and god knows what else all came together in a
very bad way as the masterlink on his chain popped off.  It just so
happened he was leaned over in a corner when it grenaded and the road
rash, combined with broken bones will forever remind him that I did warn
him.  Now about that cam chain you're thinking of replacing in your 8 or
is it $9000 Porsche engine......should I start with a warning or refer
you to the above story?  Tick, tick, tick, TICK, TICK....I wouldn't be
able to sleep nights.

In defense or the idea, a car engine never turns 12000 RPM like that
bike did all day long.  But then an entire bike engine doesn't cost what
the head on that Porsche costs.

85.5 944  <---  damn glad it only has 8 valves, and no ticking time
bomb.
