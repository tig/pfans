I went to visit my local mechanic (Midwest Eurosport, Bensenville,
Illinois) last night, and guess what he had inside for servicing.  Several
years ago, there was an article written (possibly in Excellence?) about a
car in Canada which originally started out as a 944S2, and was sent to
Andial for a little modification.  Well, it seems as though this car has
been in the Chicago area for a little while now.  Andial converted it from
NA to Turbo and installed a 968 6-speed tranny.  The cost.........about
$60k over and above the original vehicle purchase.  I didn't get the chance
to poke around the car too much, but it was a very neat package under the
hood.  I have no idea what the HP is, but the owner of the shop says it
"screams".

Just thought some of you might be interested in this little tidbit.
