There is a great game out for Playstation called Porsche Challenge which was
developed by Sony with help by Porsche.  The only car available is the
Boxster. The factory actually provided Sony with blueprints and sound samples
from the car.  There are 4 tracks including the track at Stuttgart itself.
The game play is very realistic and the car drives like you would expect it
to.  I recommend this game to all my Porsche owning friends and none has been
dissapointed.  It was probably more of a sales tactic for Porsche than
anything, but they ended up with a great game.
