Hey,

I was surprised no one answered any of the battery questions!  The factory
battery in most cars are pathetic.  In the Talon, I replaced the battery
with an Optima 800, excellent battery.  Lasted for four years on two different
cars.  Only when I gave it to Paul to use on his Talon did he manage to kill
it.  I was going to use it on my car, but it required modifying the cabling,
something I wasn't fond of.  Instead, I used a Diehard International Group 41
battery.  It cost me C$99.95 from Sears.  It's been 1.5 years so far and 
it sits at 14 volts when I turn the car on, eventually going down to 12.5V
as the car runs and consumes the excess battery power.  It always turns on
on the first try.

We just installed one on Mark's 87 Turbo.  The only bad part of that battery
is that the + terminal is left uncovered.  I use racer's tape to cover it
so that I don't spark myself and to meet the rules of the racing clubs.

BTW - so far, over 20 people have signed up for the WA/BC event.

I think bleeding the cooling system has fixed the no-heat at idle problem,
but I still don't understand why it happened all of a sudden.  Could there
have been an air pocket somewhere in the system that finally found its
way into the heating system and got stuck there?
