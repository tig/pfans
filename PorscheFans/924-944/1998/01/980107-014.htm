Dear PFans:

Thought I might give you a heads up on an issue I just became aware of. 
When you replace the balance shaft belt you want to do two things. The 
first being upgrade to the 18 mm wide belt and the second being make 
certain the belt is retensioned approx. 2k miles after it is installed. The 
18 mm upgrade is a wider and stronger belt that has a better history of 
longevity and the lack of retensioning can cause the belt to stretch 
resulting in the belt slipping a cog or two.

This just occurred on my 968 only 5k after the new belt was installed.  My 
mechanic had written on the repair order I was supposed to come in for the 
retension after 2k but I didn't read it/ didn't remember/screwed up. This 
is not something I will do again.  Fortunately, retiming was <$200. and no 
damage was incurred.

After the initial retensioning the belt should be checked for stretchage 
and adjusted according every 10k.

If a slipped belt is left unchecked the resulting additional vibration c  
ould cause serious damage to internal engine parts requiring a rebuild that 
could include in the parts list a new block.  As 968 blocks are not sitting 
in every Porsche parts yard, such a rebuild is typically a $7k - $8k 
proposition.

Just thought you might like to know.
