Greetings,
 In reference to Bob's tire problems in message number 45 dated January =
17, 1998 posting in PorscheFans does this out of round condition occur =
on new tires?
Many Porsche owners, like myself, look for the best deals on products to =
enhance our cars without sacrificing anything.=20
 Is it then safe to say that although Tire Rack does have the best =
prices, are there tires second rate or blems? Has anyone else had any =
problems with there tires? I have been thinking about a new set of tires =
for my 86 944T and they are $200.00 cheaper then at the local tire shop. =
However, I do not want to go through what Bob has gone through. My time =
is to valuable then to run back and forth to the shop for adjustments.
Any thoughts or feedback?

John
86 944T

Chris,
I change mine all the time using an inexpensive bleeder I got at Pep Boys or a
place like it.  It's called a one-man brake bleeder and it's a simple tube
with a one-way valve in it.  Cost less than $10.
