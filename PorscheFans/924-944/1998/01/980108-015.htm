Michel,
       Disregard my last e-mail. I misread your original post and thought
you were talking about the timing belt instead of the balance shaft belt.
Sorry about that.

Clark Fletcher

Hi Farzaan,
	Before going to the track, I would inspect and maybe replace the heater
control valve. The valve has had a tendensy to split at the seam, and dump
coolant onto the rear wheels! Makes for a very exciting track adventure! Alot
of time the valve will weep slowly onto the clutch's realease bearing! The hot
exhaust will burn off a small coolant leak like this so there is no coolant on
the ground. 
	I been thinking of upgrading to the '88 944 models heater valve plumbing. A
new coolant rail above the headers and some coolant hoses, ect....  On the '88
cars, Porsche moved the heater control valve up front near the oil filter
area. 
	Make sure when you bleed the cooling system to always use a pressure pump.
The kind that pumps or pressuresizes the cooling system to check for coolant
leaks. Make sure not to go more than 8 psi! Don't want to blow that radiator! 

				Good Luck, David Jalali

----------
I think bleeding the cooling system has fixed the no-heat at idle problem,
but I still don't understand why it happened all of a sudden.  Could there
have been an air pocket somewhere in the system that finally found its
way into the heating system and got stuck there?
