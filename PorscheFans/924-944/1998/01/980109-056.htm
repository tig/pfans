Sorry, my apologies for making that statement.

I had assumed that because the part numbers quoted by Alwin Springer in his
famous "PMNA Statement on aluminum control arms" are the same as the
upgraded M030/M758 part numbers, that the units were identical. I had also
inspected one of my own a-arms (S2 M030) and it showed the slotted ball
joint. That a-arm was a replacement by a PO who, I guess now, felt like
spending money! I had no other basis for making that statement.

Again, sorry for misleading the list.

P-fans:

I recently had the 60k service done at my independent Porsche service facility
on my 92 968 coupe.  I asked the owner whether I needed to bring the car back
in after a certain interval to get any of the belts retensioned.  He said that
this was not necessary for 968s.  I realize that 944s need retensioning, but
do any of the 968 belts require retensioning?  Does anyone know for sure?
