The service video sounds like a good idea. Especially to me, as a new
Porsche owner. (New to me; the car is a 1985.).

I am about to fix or replace a leaking clutch master or slave or hose, don't
know which yet. If it is a master cylinder I am considering a kit vs new due
to cost. If a slave said kit may be unavailable locally. Do kits generally
hold up well if the cylinders are not pitted?

I have a VHS camcorder and can tape the job, if of interest.

The next thing may be replacement of timing belt and water pump. My 85/1 944
has 108,000 miles on it and I have owned it just a few days, so presume I
should change both before the 120,000 mark. Can video that, too, if desired.

I understand the weather problem in the NE, but here in Hawaii it is not a
factor. Experience with this car may be a problem.

The problem here is that to save money I will probably use shade tree
mechanics for all but the timing belt, and because I'm sure he won't have
the tension-tool (the one that is said to cost $500 in one of the recent
postings), I may let the pros do that part. However, if one of you readers
has good advice on how to do it without the tool, I may do with shade-tree
or self, too. Let me hear from you if you know how to do this, please. Or if
you know that said tool can be rented.

Obviously I will soon want some kind of shop manual. Gather such a thing is
not available. If I'm wrong, please advise where to purchase.

Finally, I have wheels that could be the gold Fuchs, but I don't know how to
recognize them. What I have is 15 inch wheels with very shiny alloy rims,
five black spokes which are black paint over less polished alloy, and a gold
background Porsche crest in the hub with black and red bars, looking much
like the hood ornament except much less shiny in the gold area. Where the
black or red is worn through it is gold underneath. The rims are not a
simple curved surface in the shiny area, but are stepped, with each step
about one inch wide. The tires are P225 VR 60 15's. How do I tell what these
wheels are?

Just found the website a few days ago and subscribed. I plan to contribute.
