Hey there, did the exact same thing when I tried to remove the camshaft 
bolt. I was planning on replacing the camshaft front seal along with my 
balance shaft seals while I was doing a waterpump and belt job recently. 
Decided that my camshaft seal would just have to stay where it is.

Insight would be much appreciated.

Thanks,

I have just about twisted the end of my
Snap-On tool off trying to loosen the
cheesehead bolt.  I've tried heat and even an
impact wrench.  Does anyone have any
suggestions on further things to try before I
break down and drill the head off.

Thanks for any help

Darian

Automotion & Tweeks are two good catalogs to have. Performance Products and
AJUSA are two other you might be interested in. 

My company, Trackside Products, can usually supply any item found in these
catalogs for a slightly better price. Let me know if any specific items you're
interested in and the best price you've found. We are alwasys looking for
better sources to sell to our customers.

For example, Vertex seems to have the best prices around for clutch packages.
I had a customer with a 944 Turbo last week. I was able to beat up my supplier
enough to sell the clutch package for a little less than Vertex and still make
a little money.
