You may not know, but your aluminum 944 engine cylinders are coated with
teflon.  That is the reason the engines last so long.  Hence the concern
with doing a rebuild if you have to remove the coating.

The engine additives you speak of typically have a teflon type element to
make the non-Porsche owners think its an improvement for their American
iron.  With the amount of oil in a 944 engine, assuming you don't just top
it up if and when you think of it, your engine should be just fine thankyou
without the American marketing junk gumming up your bearings and oil rings.
I've had a chance to check out an engine with 140,000 miles on it, and it
would have been fine had the owner used his/her brain and thought to figure
out that when an oil pressure gauge displays zero it might suggest turning
the engine off.  Considering the owner drove the 944 for miles and miles,
the block was fine but the bearings were no longer within factory specs!  In
short, if you want to drive your car without any oil or you wish to take the
valve cover off and spray it down with a fire hose, then get a piece of junk
and add a gummy additive to the oil so you can be proud of your ability to
drive the car into the ground, quickly.

If you want to use something to help your 944, then use the RedLine
"water-wetter" to enhance cooling and waterpump life, and I'd suggest the
Redline manual transmission fluid to protect the transaxel bits'n'pieces.  I
use both and have found both the engine and transmission cooling/operation
improved; this is especially true when autocrossing and doing track type
events when I push the car for performance.
