According to Bob Vieu, owner of Auto Edge, here in the Twin City area, in a 
recent tech session on the 944 engine, they rotate at 4x crank speed.  Most 
of us at the tech session were surprised at this revelation as we thought 
they rotated at 2x.  That means at 6000 those little guys are spinnin' at 
24,000 rpm!  WOW!

I thought these were run at two times the crank speed
