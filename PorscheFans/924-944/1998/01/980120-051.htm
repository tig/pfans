In a message dated 98-01-20 15:19:45 EST, you write:

<<  First, it     
  seemed a bit slower off the line than the other two, and second, the      
  exhaust sounded a bit "tinny" or "airy" (lame words I know but the only   
  two I can think of to describe).  I was expecting it to sound smoother    
  and deeper than the other two.  Also, I was waiting to hear a turbo       
  "whine" like you hear in a Volvo or Saab.  No?                            
                                                                            
  Lastly, the Turbo I drove had a timer on it so that even after you turn   
  the ignition off, the engin keeps running for a minute to allow the Turbo 
  to cool down.  Is that necessary and/or ususal?                  >>

Ben,
Yes, it probably did feel slower off the line.  especially if it hasn't been
chipped, it's almost a dog until you get it up to 3000rpm.  Also, it's more
important for the turbo car to warm up.  I know what you mean about the funny
sound from the exhaust, my neighbors get to hear it every morning I drive my
951 to work.  I think the whine is tought to hear because of everything
covering it up (i.e., intake stuff and exhaust stuff).  When I put my test
pipe and cone air filter on, I could really hear it, sounds pretty cool!  The
turbo timer is not as critical on 944Turbo's because they have a water pump
which circulates water through the turbo for ???20?? seconds after you shut it
off.
