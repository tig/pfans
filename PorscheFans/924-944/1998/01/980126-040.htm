Two things:

1.	DME relay is a known week spot (if it looks burnt replace it), if
not at least have a spare on hand
2.	You may have gotten water on your DME, it is right under the battery
tray in the passenger foot rest area, that will cause a similar effect.
	(to clean, just get some Printed Circuit Board cleaner and clean it
if you know what you are doing)


	Been There - had that, got the bill to prove it !

	Subject:	Question for DME Guru...

	I have figure out the source of the clicking noise-to-engine RPM
problem with
	my 87 924S. It is coming from the fuel pump relay, which actually
contains 2
	relays. One comes on with the key and seems to power up the actual
pump relay
	and the DME. The other half which actually conrols the pump is
making the
	noise, and by pocking at the contact lever when it is running I can
feel that
	the power to the solenoid part of the relay is pulsing to engine
rpm.  It
	seems that the relay is controled by the DME, which is where the
ground side
	of the solenoid goes, the other side is hot when the key is turned,
but engine
	not yet running. Is there something wrong with the DME which could
be causing
	the non-steady ground, or is it supposed to pulse and the relay is
just
	getting noisy, which seems mighty odd. There is some evidence that
this relay
	has been warm in the past, as it is a slightly more burnt color of
copper than
	the other one. It does not seem to have been caused by relay arcing,
as
	contacts look clean and shiny. I hate to plunk down bucks for a new
relay just
	for trial and error, as it does not seem to be the relay thats
causing the
	problem. I don't think its the fuel pump either, as if I push the
contacts
	closed when nothing is running the pump runs fine and there is no
pulsing. I
	hate to just go opening up the DME looking for toasted transistors
or
	something, but that may be the next step. Any advice?
