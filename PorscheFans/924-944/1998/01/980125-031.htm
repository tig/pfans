Simon,
It's an overflow hose.  You engine might be overheating because any time the
radiator cap is opened, air can be introduced into the cooling
system--possibly resulting in overheating.  You probably already know this,
but just in case...   To fill:  (1) move center heater level to the right,
(2) losen small hose clamp and remove vent plug on upper hose near the fuel
lines in engine (it's off-red in color), (3) add any coolant necessary to
the expansion tank, (4) start engine and idle for a minute or so, (5) if
bubbles show up at the vent opening, add coolant, (6) re-install plug and
tighten the hose clamp, and (7) shut off engine.  Most folks use distilled
water with their safe-for-aluminium-engines antifreeze.

Hello there

I noticed today that after running my '84 924 for about twenty or thirty
minutes on my driveway that a hose attached to the top of the coolant tank,
just below the pressure cap was not connected to anything and was pumping
quite a bit of water out. Is this an overflow hose or should it be attached
somewhere?

Thanks.

Simon
