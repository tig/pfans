Update: after sitting in a warm garage overnight, the car starts right up
and runs indefinitely. Only one problem: the airbag warning light is now
on. Coincidence? Probably not. My guess is that water found its way to
someplace it shouldn't be (we've had a *lot* of rain in the SF bay area
lately, and the car was outside all day yesterday). I reset the airbag
warning light using the procedure in the FAQ, so all is back to normal.

While I'm glad the car is running again, this doesn't exactly leave me with
a warm fuzzy feeling. The fuse box area and passenger footwell are/were
completely dry--anywhere else I should look for water? What might have
caused these two problems simulataneously?

Thanks,
