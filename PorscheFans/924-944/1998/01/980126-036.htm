I also purchased an adapter from Performance.  I didn't like the fact the
piece is about 3" high, making it very difficult to fit the jack under the
car.  What I prefer - I think it's safer (non-slip) and won't crack your paint
and undercoat, is a hockey puck.

I drilled one out, placed a short capscrew (about 7/8 X 2) through the center,
and it works great!  Even with a slightly lowered car, you can still get the
jack underneath for a "one-shot" lift.  I suppose that depends on your jack,
though.
