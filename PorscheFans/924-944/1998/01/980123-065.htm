P-Fans,

I'm going to throw a vote into the ring here -- 1981 924 GTP!!

This car gets my vote because it brought together nearly every technological
advance eventually revealed throughout the line. For one it was the first
time we saw the 2.5L all aluminum engine with twin balance shafts. The
engine was topped with 16 valve heads and dual overhead cams. And it
provided up to 500 hp with it's KKK turbocharger AND Bosch Motronic complete
engine management electronics. It was a prototype, not production car, and
raced at Lemans. Oh, it also weighted in at about 2,000 lbs.

Plus, this car is so rare I can't even find a picture of one in any of my
books. I would love to see one of these.

Farzaan, if you REEAAALLLLY want a 968 Turbo S (was it also called the 968
GTS?), I think I know where you can get one. Of course it's a race car (as
they're not legal otherwise). But I don't think they'll take a kidney...
maybe just a big pile of green stuff. But I agree... it's my absolute
favorite dream car also.

Well, except maybe a McLaren F1....
