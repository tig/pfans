doc,
What leads you to believe you have no boost? What type of gauge are you
using? There are too many things involved with boost (vaccum hoses,
electrical connections,etc) to trouble shoot without seeing. However I
would suggest hooking up a mechanical gauge 1st to see if it is not just
a faulty gauge. The factory gauge is electronic therefore can not be
trusted in a trouble-shooting enviroment. You need to see actual
manifold pressure not an electronic guestemate! Anyway if after seeing
the readings on a mech gauge it still reads no boost re trace every hose
and electrical connection. Also do not forget to check the hose leading
to the wastegate. good luck
