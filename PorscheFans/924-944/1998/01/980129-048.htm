That's what I have been curious about, the name of the color.  I got in
touch with Lee and he mentioned the Kalahari Gold and one other color
listed in an 86 brochure.  I'm assuming if this was available for 2 or 3
years that this is the color for my 87.  I am going to be sending off for a
certificate of authenticity.  (Another idea given to me by Lee)

That is my boyfriends name.  I hope to get some pictures of his 83 on the
page.  Don't have any in my system yet.  Still need to get a scanner.

Yea, this was brought to my attention by several people on the list.  I'll
be fixing that this evening.  I should have known when I saved it last
night.  I work with UNIX on a daily basis but it was late and I was tired.

I wonder who that may be.  She just happened to be there when the picture
was taken.
