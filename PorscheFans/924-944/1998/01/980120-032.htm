A completely new block was cast.  The outside was the same however the inside
was different.  All four cylinders are joined together.  Reducing the amount of
water necessary to cool the block.  Also strengthening the cylinders.  On the
underside small plates were installed between the cylinders and the sides of
the block.  Supposedly to reduce the affects of backside piston pressure, and
to prevent oil from splashing too high in the block.

The '89 2.7 liter block is either the same or almost the same block used for
the 3.0 S2 cars.

I doubt you can bore a 2.5 liter block from 100mm to 104mm and have reliable
results.  This would effectively remove the OEM sleeve that is installed in the
block.  The block would probably have to be bored another 2mm for another
sleeve to be put in.

Sometimes, small things come in big packages but
  once in awhile, a big thing is crammed in to a
    small package, and the package breaks.
