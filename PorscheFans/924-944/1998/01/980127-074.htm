Mechanical:
- mechanical speedometer due to old-style dash (also old-style steering,
seats, HVAC, etc.) (944 has electronic)
- no wear indicators on brakes 
- bumpers, fenders, rockers, spoilers, mouldings, glass, etc.
- wiring
- In North America, engines were identical (147HP), though 5th gear was
shorter. Europeans (and ROW?) received a 150HP DIN motor (944: 163HP DIN).
All other differences refer to North American models. YMMV.

Supension:
- front steel trailing arms and ancillaries (944 has alloy; both have alloy
rear)
- track - about 1" less
- Front bars: 20mm base, 21.5mm/23x3.5mm opt. (944: 20/21.5/23x3.5 base,
25.5x4 opt.)
- Rear bars: none base, 14mm opt. (944: none base, 18mm opt.)

Tires/Wheels

924S base: 195/65VR15 on 6J x 15 phone dial (old-style offset)
944 base: 215/60VR15 on 7J x 15 phone dial (new offset)

924S opt: 205/55VR16 on 6J x 16 forged slot (928-style)
944 opt: 205/55VR16 on 7J x 16 phone dial front and 225/55VR16 on 8Jx16
rear phone dial (new offset)

That's about all I can think of right now. I may be wrong on some details,
corrections/additions welcome. Hmm. Once complete, I'll add this to the web
page.

<< 1.  Does this diagnosis sound logical?
 2.  Can a existing "brain" be serviced by anyone?
 3.  Where might you suggest would be the best places to call to get a brain?
>>

Ed,
1.  Yes, exact symptoms as mine except we rewired the harness before replacing
the brain!
2.  Replaced yes, serviced???  I think all the new ones are actually Bosche
remanufactured.  
3.  My buddy/mechanic found mine for $250 from an '88 Turbo.  I actually
traded him a bunch of Cuban cigars for it.
