I am Guilty of PPP (Parental Porsche Purchase).  They bought the
fixer-upper, I paid all repair (which is about as much as the car
itself...)  2 years of 14hour graveyard shifts (5:30p-7:30am on
school-nights) and some crazy-assed stock investments with my entire
savings account paid off for the rest of my 944's happy upgrades :D

My best friend got a brand new civic DX the same year; 95HP, 175mm/70R/14
tire set up (at least we had fun doing 360s with the handbrake on rainy
nights).  Civic cost more, go slower, and it's now rusting here and there
(despite the "electronic rush protector" the dealer con-ed him into
buying).  My galvinized 944 got scratches, but no rust at all. Matt, I
don't think picking up girls has to do with the car that much--but I do
enjoy the fact that I never have to take more than 1 person home.

>i have even seen a few girls WORKING on them, 

"Baylor University" was it?  I'm soooooooo there.

My eventual upgrade from GF-v2.0, who loved my mom's '86Toyota rust-bucket
(over my 944) was a good choice.  However, current version of GF-v3.0,
although does appreciate my 944, seem to have some virtual-jealousy virus
against my 944.  Could be because I sometimes spend over 14hours in one
session working on Ms.944.  I suppose a resolve would be to spend more time
with Gf-v3.0  OR-  
anyone know of a good anti-virus program?
