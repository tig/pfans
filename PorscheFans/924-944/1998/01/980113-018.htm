Don,
   I can't post to the list right now due to some problem with NT mail. You
may want to forward this to the list if you think it's worthwhile.
Continuing the thread on overheating Tech Quiz question; I came up with the
slipping impeller shaft pulley from a discussion with a shop owner a couple
of months back. Apparently, they've gotten several of the new style rebuilt
water pumps from different sources that the pulley would slip on the shaft
for the water pump impeller. In all cases, they only way they discovered it
was after the water pump was in the car and it started overheating. As a
result, they have started putting two small tack welds on the end of the
shaft at the pulley. They only do this to the rebuilt pumps they get. They
tack the pulley on opposite sides of the end of the impeller shaft so that
it will keep the impeller properly balanced. Have you ever seen this
problem?

Talk to you later,
Clark Fletcher
