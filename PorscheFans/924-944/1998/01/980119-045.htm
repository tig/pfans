Good point. I just want to ad that the initial countersteer must
be done immediately! Like Right Away! Even in a 944, if you don't
catch the car quickly, you're not going to catch it. I like to
think of a 'snap', you feel the rear start to go, you 'snap' the
steering wheel to catch the slide. Do it right, and you can keep
your foot in the throttle. However, if you are unsure, I recommend
that you lift completely, but still snap the wheel into the skid.

Once you make the initial correction, you must be ready for the
rear to come around the other way. If you're good, you'll be
unwinding the wheel even before the car seems to respond, 
the quicker you catch the slide, the less of a correction you
need to make. That's why if you wait too long and then do catch
it, you must be prepared for the rear to go the other way. If
you have lifted off the throttle you'll at least be slowing down
as you saw the wheel back and forth.

The best place to practice this sort of thing is on an autocross
course. There is nothing to hit, no one's going to laugh (well,
not too loud anyway), and you can try a number of techniques.
My region (Metro NY) has an autcross school every year. At the
school, we break an a/x course into parts (slalom, skid pad, 
decreasing radius turns, threshold braking, etc.) and you get to
work on each part. The descreasing radius turn is an excellent place
to work on sliding and correction. You can slide the rear on
corner entry (especially if you brake to late, or stay on the
brakes too long) and then again on corner exit (if you use too
much throttle or get on the throttle too soon), so you get to
learn twice as much!

Again, join the PCA and take advantage of the programs and
instruction available.
