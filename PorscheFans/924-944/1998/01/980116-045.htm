Marv, yes you are correct that I was comparing the new stainless steel
lines with 80K miles old rubber hoses.  I wouldn't be surprised if I
couldn't tell the difference between new rubber hoses and s.s. lines.  One
other thing that persuaded me to try them; as I recall, the s.s. lines were
much less expensive than a set of OEM hoses.  I'm sure my s.s. lines are
not DOT approved since I installed them around 6 or 7 years ago.  I guess I
should take a real close look at them when I do my next brake job.  Perhaps
there will be some teflon particle residue if any significant wear is
taking place.  Also, it should be fairly obvious if any of the s.s. strands
are fatiguing and breaking away from the swaged ends.

It's time to replace the motor mounts on my 944na...

a.) What's the typical cost of bringing the car to a shop?

b.) How can I do it myself?  How does one hoist/jack the motor?
