It's not that complicated to exchange the rear speakers ... 
It's just a little bit glue which is used to fit the covers. You can 
easyly remove that and get from the bottom to the speakers. I added 
SinusLive bass speakers in the back, which was a BIG step to better 
music.
I also added some Hightone speakers (tweakers) at the doors near the 
attachments, so they are nearer at the ears. They are really small 
and makes a much roomier sound.
