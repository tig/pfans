A while back Porsche sent out a tech bulletin on the subject, which
basically said If you let the car warm-up with no load, carbon builds up on
the back of the valves. 

	Given in the past they (Porsche) had recommend letting the warm-up
prior to use in cold weather, this took a tech bulletin to pass the word.

I start and go, but I don't let my rpm's get over 2.5k until I have movement
on the temp gauge, and on my track car I don't even think about pushing
until the oil temp gets to 120 f.

	Hello Lawrence,

	> My 83 944 often ends up my daily driver... my question is - should
I
	> warm up the engine in the garage or just start it and drive it?
I've

	My opinion:
	Jump in and drive. But gently, until the engine reached normal
	operating temperature. Idling is not good for the engine, it will
	take too long to warm up because there is no load on it. You're
	best off just driving, but again, gently. I try not to exceed
	3000 rpm until the water temp comes up, then I won't go above
	4K until everything has warmed up. 

	Note that other parts of the car have to warm up too. The suspension
	(shocks), brakes, transaxle, etc. all need some time to warm up.
	Having the engine idle does nothing for those components.
