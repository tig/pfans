Well I'm enjoying my '87 guards red 924S as my daily driver.  The only 
problem is that cars regularly get oversprayed at the shipyard I work 
at.  Does anyone know of a good quality, light car cover that won't 
scratch the car when it gets wet and then drys on the car?

Some personal experience and suggestions:=0A=0A=0ACV Joints and the 951:=
=0A=0APorsche changed the CV joints and half shafts for the 951 during th=
e 1987=0Amodel year.  The parts booklet provides the VIN changeover infor=
mation.  On my=0A=9187 951 which had the earlier style, I recently bought=
 two used half shafts,=0Aand changed over to the later-style joints.  I a=
m not sure whether the later=0Ajoints are superior, but I needed new CVs =
anyway, and the half shafts were not=0Aexpensive.  The boots on the later=
-style joints are different as well.=0A=0AWhen changing or re-lubricating=
 the CV joints, I usually replace the=0Atransmission fluid, and if necess=
ary the outer transmission flange seals.  I=0Ahad a problem from time to =
time with these leaking on my original =9184 944=0Ayears ago, but so far =
no issues with any of the Turbo cars.  I have used=0ASwepco gear lube for=
 10 years in 944 and 951 gearboxes, per the suggestion of=0ABruce Anderso=
n.  I have no complaints.=0A=0AI have been using Redline=92s CV grease in=
 the CV joints for several years.  I=0Ahave noticed that on the Turbo car=
s, the inner CV bolts have a tendency to=0Aback out.  So far this is only=
 true on my =9187, which is used for AX and track=0Adriving in addition t=
o commuting.  During the last competition season, the=0Aproblem got so ba=
d that I had to re-tighten the bolts each day at the track.=0AI have not =
been able to figure out what caused this.=0A=0AMy first attempted solutio=
n was to use mild Loctite on the bolts.  I had=0Aalready changed over to =
new allen head bolts of the right strength grade.  I=0Aalso made certain =
that the threads on the bolts and in the flanges were=0Aabsolutely clean =
of any grease by using a solvent.=0A=0AWell, the Loctite didn=92t work.  =
Then I got a suggestion from a friend who has=0Aa 911 repair business.  H=
e suggested that I use some special ribbed and dished=0Alock washers.  Th=
ese are called for in the microfiche for several 911 and 914=0ACV joint a=
pplications.  I bought some of these washers at the dealer.=0A=0ASince I =
was tired of fooling with the joints, I decided to add one more=0Aprecaut=
ion-- safety wire.  I understand that this method is sometimes used by=0A=
the pros, including the guys from Porsche AG.  I bought the special plier=
s and=0Adrilled the heads of the 24 bolts on a drill press, and wired =91=
em together.=0ANow, with the wire, the washers, and some mild Loctite, ho=
pefully they won=92t=0Aback out.=0A=0AThere is still no explanation for m=
y problem with the bolts backing out.  The=0Agearbox and its mounts are f=
ine, and we are careful with the drivetrain.  The=0Aonly thing I can thin=
k of is that maybe the characteristics of the Redline=0Agrease are such t=
hat it wicks into the threads easier than normal moly grease.=0AWho knows=
?  I have a few more track tests to run, but I think my problem is=0Asolv=
ed.=0A=0AAs an aside, there are several people offering race-style CV boo=
ts for Porsche=0Aand BMW.  These are more expensive than the factory/afte=
rmarket style (as much=0Aas $25-50 each), but are shaped to keep more gre=
ase in the joint.  At least=0Aone vendor claims that what he sells are Ma=
rch Indy car boots.  Someday I may=0Atry these if the price comes down a =
bit.=0A=0AIf you drive your car on the track or in AX, include the CV bol=
ts in your=0Ainspection routine.  If they back out enough, you could have=
 a big problem.=0A=0A=0A=0A=0A

Another suggestion.  Worked for me.=0A=0A=0ACleaning the Underside of the=
 944/951=0A=0ASince I have been spending so much time underneath my =9187=
 951, I decided to=0Atake a suggestion from a friend.  In the past, he ca=
mpaigned a 944 in the=0Alocal SCCA ITS class.  The car he developed has s=
ome history, as it was=0Aoriginally used by Walt Maas and Jon Milledge to=
 win the initial IMSA=0AFirestone Firehawk Series in 1985 (sponsored by C=
arlsen Motor Cars).=0A=0AAnyway, he suggested that I take the time to cle=
an the undertrappings of the=0Acar to make it easier to inspect and to wo=
rk on.  He suggested using an=0Aaerosol engine cleaner and a high pressur=
e washer.=0A=0ASo, one day, I drove over to a local self-serve auto wash.=
  With the car=0Apretty cold, I jacked it up and placed it on jackstands.=
  Then I sprayed on=0Athe cleaner and let it soak in.  Finally, I used th=
e high pressure system to=0Arinse it off.  While there, I did a quick upp=
er-surface wash job (I always use=0Amy own soap-- Sonax, and bring a diap=
er, towels and a bucket for this).  Of=0Acourse, it helps to remove the w=
heels while the car is up.  You probably don=92t=0Awant to get the engine=
 cleaner on the wheels or other sensitive areas.=0A=0AThe final result-- =
a clean underbody!  Incidentally, for the engine=0Acomprtment, I prefer P=
21s over true engine cleaners.=0A=0A- Mike=0AMahler9th@aol.com=0A=0A=0A=
