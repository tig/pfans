Well, I don't think it would be so horrible to sell the 951 to get a '93
M5.  There is a 4-door car that can perform with the best of them!

Does anyone know of a source for DME schematics. My fuel pump relay is being
mishandled by the dme, I am sure of it. The switching transistor which
controls the relay seems to be ok, but I cannot figure out the circuitry that
provides the base current to the transistor. I may just bypass the whole mess
for a while, as everything works ok if I over-ride it, but I hate to have the
pump running without the engine going in the event of an accident. This and 87
924S, by the way. I suppose its supposed to be a black box and it either works
or it don't, but hey, its just another device with parts that can be diagnosed
and replaced like any other piece of electronic equipment. Perhaps I can get
one from Bosch? Frenna@aol.com
