IMHO:

RE71 : Good, cheap.
AVSs1: Better, not bad ("affordable").
Pilot: Better yet, way too expensive.

Deal: Yoko AVSi's once they start clearing them out.

BTW, the above tires will give a tread life that is disconcertingly short
compared to a Sport 4000. About one-third, I'd guess. 

(FWIW, I have Sport 4000's thanks to a PO that I'll be selling in the spring.)

nice. In more vigorous driving 225/50 and 245/45 is the way to go. My track
tires are 245/45 fr 265/45 rear and these sizes are not very, er,
user-friendly on the street, and I'm not convinced they offer any great
advantage (unless I went to wider rims).

245's will fit on 8" rims (maybe even 7"), but some 245's are moulded to
really prefer a 9" rim.

Cheers,
Craig.
