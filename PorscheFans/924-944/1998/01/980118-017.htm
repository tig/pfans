Randall,

I too would be interested in what the "experts" and the book have to say.
But, I have changed the pads on my Turbo S at least a half dozen times and
this procedure has never caused me a problem.

There are two spring clip retainers which are just pried up first. Then I
use a large flat blade screw driver to pry against the old pads and compress
the pistons back into the caliper changing one side at a time. I have never
experienced fluid being forced back out of the master cylinder. The brakes
are then bed in the usual manner -- 4-6 vigorous stops to fully warm things
up followed by one or two full-on stops and a nice long cool down drive.
Double check fluid level both before an after the bedding in. Also, if you
haven't changed your brake fluid, now is a good time to do that as well.
Mine is changed every year and bled after every day at the track (drivers
ed).

One word of caution, never retract the pistons by putting pressure (read
screwdriver) in the center of the pistons. Apparently, the material there is
subject to damage and distortion that might require replacement of the
pistons.

Does anyone have a written procedure for changing the front pads on 89
944T.  My Haynes manual says special tools are required and to take it
to dealer.  Is this true?  Is it any harder than a normal GM Pad
change?  Any help appreciated.  Thanks.
