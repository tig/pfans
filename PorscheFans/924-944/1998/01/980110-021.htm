Chris, I did have a positive expreience with Motorworks.  During Winter
break, I decided to replace my 951 clutch in my garage.  The Monday
after X-mas, I called over there to find out if they could machine my
flywheel for me.  I too was greeted by a fairly rude person who told me
that they were pretty backed up from the holidays and that it would take
all day, but a couple of people at PCASD recommended them.  I walked in
wearing my PCA sweatshirt (an excellent X-mas gift!), and when the owner
saw it, he stepped in front of the guy at the counter, and told me that
he'd have it done in an hour.  Both the counter-worker and I were very
surprised.  I guess membership does have its privileges!

So, who knows, maybe they need to give that guy an attitude adjustment!

Hope that helps a bit!
