P-Fans:

The PO of my 968 used the car has his primary vehicle for the four years he 
owned it.  So it (the car) saw four years of salt and sand here in 
Minnesota winter and the only outcome of this is some corrosion on the 
brake calipers, easily repaired with a simple rebuild of the caliper.  I am 
in the practice, however of washing the car very often to keep the crap 
off.
