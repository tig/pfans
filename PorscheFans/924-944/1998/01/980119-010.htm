I haven't been happy with either the pressure bleeder I had (used pressure from a
tire to pressure bleed brakes, or the tube with the check valve). What I have been
happy with are speed bleeders (http://www.speedbleeders.com). They are replacement
brake bleeder screws with a biult in check valve. I hook a piece of hose to them,
crack open a pump a couple of times and the brakes are bled. They have sealant on
the threads so that you don't suck air in past the threads and they work terrific.
I don't have them on my Porsche yet (but I have the speedbleeers), but they work
terrific on my Scorpio. They only cost about $6 each. Also, don't worry about the
check valve. When they are screwed down, they seal just like a normal bleeder
screw, the check valve only does something when they are cracked open.
