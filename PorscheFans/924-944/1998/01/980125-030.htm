That's a good list. I suggest, if anyone is good at this, a workthrough
of the DME system (locations of sensors, demonstrate how to diagnose
their failure, etc.), a look at the door cavity area (many problems -
window regulators, door handle replacement, window motor), and, if some
people have audio systems they would like to show off, that would make a
great compilation video, along with installation and custom fabrication
tips.

This is a great idea, folks. Operators are standing by - produce your
videos now. <g>
