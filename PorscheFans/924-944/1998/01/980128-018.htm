     I was speaking with the owner of an '87 NA 944.  He changes the timing 
     belt on a 50k basis.  I know with the early 944's it is critical to 
     change every 30k.  I have also been told that the belts were improved 
     in later models.  Is the 50k change okay, or is the owner just lucky 
     and should be on a 30k schedule?  This is important because I am 
     considering purchasing the automobile and the last belt just has 30k 
     on it.  I was just wondering what experience other owners of 87s have.
     
     Thanks in advance,
     Samuel
