Hi,

I bought a pair of Infinity Kappa 4x6 speakers to install in the door
panels of my 1990 S2, but I'm now having reservations about them because
of the fit.  Has anyone installed these speakers in a late model car =
with
the "snap-on" type grills.  If so, how did you do it?  The speakers =
aren't
DIN size and therefore the grills are too large.  I've thought about =
using
the screw-on grills like on earlier cars but the Kappas don't cover all
the exposed door metal around the cutout on my car (the corners are dog
eared), so I think there might be some of the metal exposed and this =
would
look tacky.

Any hints would be appreciated.  Otherwise I'm sending them back and =
will
go with a more custom install.  If I send them back anyone want them
before I do?  They list for $169 and I paid $85.  Thanks.

Hi Tom
I put the same speakers in the front and rear stock locations of my 944. =
The trick that I found was finding the correct grills. My local car =
stereo shop had some Advent grills that worked perfectly. In fact they =
knew exactly what I was looking for when they saw my 944 pull up! The =
grills cover all the exposed metal and used the stock mounting holes. =
The only modification needed was to remove some of the plastic screw =
housing from inside the grill so that the grill will sit flat. The =
speakers look great with these grills mounted in the door and no extra =
holes or modifications to the car needed. One word of warning - the =
Kappas need more power than the stock type radio can offer. They are =
just starting to sound good when the power runs out.
