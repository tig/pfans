I thought the article rang very true. I suspect the ambiguity you feel
shows up because, well, some things are hard to describe in words. :-) If
you have a library handy, see "Car and Driver," August '86, vol 32, no 2,
page 87 for an article "World Championship Driver's Ed." which is perhaps
easier to understand (and is also, imho, the best short article on "how to
drive" that I've ever read.)

You may also want to post to the racing list for more reaction. I see Mark
Forrester is featured in the article and I believe he is on the racer's
list (assuming it is the same person).

Well of course! You have to walk before you run.

I was a big fan of self-preservation when I instructed (I don't anymore). I
was somewhat delighted to hear Mr. Cobb's first words to an (experienced)
student were the same as I used to say - "Don't scare me!" Technically (as
opposed to mentally), most beginners turn in way to early if left to their
own devices. This is very scary to the instructor. (The student usually
just tightens up on corner exit and doesn't know any better). Thus, one
teaches a very safe line, late apexes, straight-line braking only, etc.
etc. etc. Once the student can drive reasonably at that level, then the
parameters can change...

Remember, everyone has a different style of driving, and there is no one
correct "method."
