Regarding bras which protect the airdam but leave the nose exposed I
belive one of the girlfriend threads hinted at this. You need a peephole
bra. I provides all the underside support you need while exposing the
nice curved rounded shapes that we all seem to enjoy so much.

Porsche Fans,

I have two 931's that don't get driven on a daily basis and are kept in my
garage.  I usually start and drive them at least once every month and change
the oil on a regular schedule.  But the last half of the year wasn't usual for
me and 6 months went by in a blink.  My questions that follow stem from what I
found when I did start them up.  

It's kind of funny, the '81 high miler started and ran fine, it was the '82
that had developed a couple of glitches.  I haven't put a wrench to the car
yet and was hoping that some of you knowledgeable Porschephiles could point me
in the right direction with some online diagnosis.


Number One:  The car started up fine and I drove it away keeping the revs down
til it warmed up.  Once fully warm I took it out and ran it around a nearby
lake,  (Some twisties and not many cars around this time of year) giving it a
less than full  workout (see: Number Two).  All temp and pressure gauges read
normal.  

On the way back, the engine started running very rough.  The condition
deteriorated quickly and the engine died.  Upon restart, the engine sputtered
and coughed and the only way to keep it going at all was to use 1/2 to full
throttle.  Even then the rpm only got up to about 2500 and I could hear the
turbo really spooling up (something that doesn't happen under normal
conditions until well into the higher revs).  I didn't like the sound of that
so I just let it sit.   After about a half an hour, the car started up and ran
fine, so I headed toward home.  I got another five minutes down the road and
the trouble started all over again.  Fortunately I was able to coast the rest
of the way home.

I thought maybe the fuel had turned bad, even though I had stabilizer in it,
so I siphoned the tank, filled it with fresh fuel, and added some techron.

That wasn't it.  I have tried several times since with the same results.
About 15 to 30 minutes after the engine is warm and running smoothly, the
problem returns.  I've looked for vacuum leaks, bad connections and other
explanations.  Stumped!  Help!!!.

Number Two, or... The reason I couldn't give the car a good workout:  When I
got out on the road, I noticed that the brake pedal was stiff and I wasn't
able to depress it very far.  The car seemed to stop okay on my neighborhood
streets, so I headed to the lake.  Just before I got to the twisties, I tested
the brakes with a moderately hard stop from about 60 mph.  This resulted in
the rear wheels locking up and less than acceptable stopping distance.  

My pedal is still stiff.  (Something my wife (ver.1) finds... no, I won't go
there.) 

What do I look for:  Master cylinder?  Proportioning valve? (where?)  Frozen
caliper?


Sidebars: 
 
-I live north of Denver, CO.  How do I get in touch with my local Porsche Club
and where are they located?

-Someone emailed me earlier asking about how to add a boost control to a 931
and I never got back.  Sorry, hit delete too soon.  Email me again and I'll
reply.

All,

Has anyone had any experience with enlarged throttle bodies on a 951?  Seems
like the gains would be minimal on a stock vehical.  However, if you had say a
K27 turbo and other "more air flow" type modes, it could make a pretty good
package difference.

I'm asking because it doesn't seem to hard to do.  I've seen them for sale for
pretty steep.  But it seems that a machine shop could bore it out, then it'ld
be a matter of fitting the appropriate sized butterfly valve, and that'ld be
it.

Bill B., Lee. L., and List:

I made one of the harness guide devices that Lee referred to for about $5.00
from some webbing that I bought at REI (the outdoor products store).  It works
okay to keep the belts loctated on your shoulders if you use the Porsche high
back seats on the track.. You can also buy/make a sternum strap, to fasten
around the belts on your chest in case of a wreck.

All of this is to keep the belts from spreading and causing you injury in an
impact.  The best solution is to either buy a more appropriate seat, or cut
slits in your seats to have the belts go through.  A friend had to do this at
the Club Race at Las Vegas-- they wouldn't let him clear tech otherwise.  He
hated to cut his factory seats, but...he wanted to race...
