Hmm. I must confess I saw the ads a number of years ago and the place may
no longer exist. Sorry, I can't remember the name, but it was *something*
racing, and they specialized in 911's.

For the past two or three years the only parts I have bought in the States
are ones that are not available here. Either my local import auto jobber or
the local dealer have had better prices than the regular prices of
advertisers in Pano or Excellence once the exchange and all that is figured
out. I've also found out that mail-order returns (due to wrong part
shipped) are frustrating and time-consuming, while the local jobber has
sent a truck out to my house to exchange parts he's incorrectly given me.

The US-CDN exchange rate is just killer. However (and this'll be
interesting the see) the US-DM rate has also slipped, while the CDN-DM rate
has remaind constant. It'll be interesting to see what this does to new
German auto/parts prices. I know used car prices here are now (relatively)
high because of all the Americans coming up here and buying at (to them)
cheap prices.
