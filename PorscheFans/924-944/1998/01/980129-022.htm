I have a 1987 944S with 112,000 miles, my first Porsche, do not know =
past history of this car. When I purchased this car it was not running, =
Water pump failure broken timing belt and  4 bent valves.
Replaced bent valves and all valve seals, guides and valve steams =
appeared to be good shape no excessive wear. Cylinder walls look very =
good and no ridge, slight carbon build up on top of pistons, carbon =
buildup is wet not dry and intake manifold has an oily black residue =
inside of manifold.
After assembly and all necessary adjustments were made I have put 10,000 =
miles on this car and it is using 4 to 5 quarts of oil in a 1,000 miles, =
Yes you read this Wright 4 to 5 quarts. I have used 20-50 GT Penn, =
10-40, 10-30 and 30w makes no difference on grade or brand of oil, still =
using 4 to 5 quarts in a 1,000 miles.
Engine compression within spec.(at high end) no blow by, changed spark =
plugs at 9,500 miles no carbon or oil build up on plugs, engine resealed =
when head was removed no external oil leaks, and this car runs great =
except for the cloud of smoke it leaves behind you at times, does not =
smoke when you 1st start engine cold or hot. only smokes above 3,500 RPM =
and not all of the time?
I even removed the crank case vent hose from intake and there was no =
change in oil consumption. Valve steam seals are in place.
Going to do a leak down test this weekend.
I know this sounds impossible but how can so much oil go into the =
combustion chamber and have good compression, no blow by, will not oil =
foul plugs and run so good?????????.   =20

Has any body had this problem.
