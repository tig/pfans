Possibly:

1. As you note, low coolant and/or air bubble in cooling system.
2. Failed bearing(s) on air flapper linkage(s) hidden under cover above
   throttle pedal. If the bearing is broken the flapper position is unpredictable
   and may behave differently if the car is moving.

A couple of other things which are NOT indicated in this case (because you do
get heat as you speed up) but might be worth checking if the above checks out
OK:

3. Failed heater control valve. Verify movement of the actuator on the valve
   in response to turning the temperature control from "cold" to "hot".
4. Lack of actuator movement in above test points to leaky vacuum line, failed
   vacuum solenoid or failed HVAC control.

Maybe some other fringe things but the above probably cover the most common
problems.

Don't freeze.
