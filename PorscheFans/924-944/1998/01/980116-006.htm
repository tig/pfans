Hey,

There is an undocumented bug assosicated with Girlfriend 1.0/2.0, and also
with Wife1.0/2.0 etc...  This is extremely important!  Altho I am sure some
of you have heard about phenomenal performance gains to be had by running
more than one version concurrently, there are some bad resource allocation
problems associated with doing so.  In short, don't try to install
Girlfriend2.0 if Girlfriend1.0/Wife1.0/etc.. is already installed.  The
screeching you hear out of GF1.0 on lateral acceleration is nothing compared
to the ruckus that two versions will make if they try to occupy the same
place at one time.  The repair for this can be VERY expensive, and will
often leave you operating without any versions of GF/Wife 1.0 etc...

Kudos to y'all for the collective technical expertise that this list
provides.  I have learn a bunch about my car in a very short time, and have
a much better running car as a result.

Regards, ...Scott
