To the best of my knowledge, the 924 Turbo never really had an "S"
package.  They did, however, have an option called M 471 for the 924 and
the Turbo.  I first saw a red one (924) as we raced at Road Atlanta when
Porsche presented them in (I think) 1979. This consisted of:

924:  Turbo-chassis
      Vented brake discs
      Koni shocks, stabilizers
      Cast 5 holes, 5-1/2 J X 15 Spoked wheels
      Leather steering wheel
      Rear spoiler

For the 1980 924 Turbo:
      Ventilated front and rear discs
      Front and reaqr stabilzers
      Koni Shocks
      Forged Wheels-5 holes 6 J X 15  

This was available on the Turbo only for 1980, because it was made
standard equipment for the 1981 and 82 model years, along with the
higher 177Hp. (156 for the U.S.) engine.

For 1981/82, the European version made the additional Hp. by using 8.5
to 1 (versus 8.0 to 1) compression and with 0.62...0.68 bar boost
(versus 0.43...0.47 bar).  The M31/50 (Carrera GT) engine had 210 Hp.
and used an intercooler as well as running 0.72...0.78 bar boost.

The GTS had 245 Hp., an intercooler similar to the 944 Turbo, and ran
1.0 bar boost at 8.0 to 1 compression.

The GTS Club Sport had about 275 Hp., a hotter cam, and a LOT of boost
(I would run 1.1...1.3 bar boost).

Sorry for the rambling, but those were great days in the early to mid
80's; racing the 924s', the DP 924 (Porsche kit cars) the 924 Carrera
GTR (in IMSA), and having as a street car for 2 years a 924 Carrera GTS
Club Sport.
