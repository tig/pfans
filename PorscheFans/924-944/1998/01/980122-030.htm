Howdy all,

Having long ago decided to become a longtime member of the 944 family 
(read that as I hate to sell cars I love!) I went ahead and bit the 
bullet. Yes, I am now the proud owner of (1) "The Tool" and (2) The 
factory workshop manuals.

I am fairly adept at the use of manuals (open book, look through 
index, find page, read page) but I am a bit less talented with the 
belt tensioning tool.

The main question I have is regarding the calibration bar.  I figured 
out how to pull the pin on the gage, lower the sliding arm, put 
the bar in the gauge, and slide the arm back. When I do that, the 
gauge reads about 3.8.  What is it supposed to read? What am I 
calibrating it to?

The other question I have is about the gauge itself.  When I have the 
calibration bar inserted it reads about 3.8. If I increase the 
reading a bit manually (with a gentle push of the finger) the gauge 
increases, but when I release pressure it returns only to around 4.1 
or so. If I push back on the bar, it will go back to 3.8.  It would 
seem to me that hysteresis would not be a good thing in a $400 
measuring tool.  Is my tool defective and should I send it back to 
Vertex? Or is it supposed to be that way? If so, on which "side" of 
the hysteresis loop should I measure?

Oh, enlightened experienced users of the tool , please pass along 
your wisdom.

-Tim

P.S.: If the tool is indeed working correctly, the upshot is that now 
there is a belt tensioning tool in the hands of a PorscheFan and PCA 
member in Germany.  Interested folks living in the Fatherland (e.g. 
Jim Moder) feel free to let me know if you would like to use "The 
Tool." We can probably work something out (though I probably won't 
let a $400 precision measuring gauge out of my sight, I do drive 
around the country alot.)
