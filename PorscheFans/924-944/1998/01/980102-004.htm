I'm planning on switching over to synthetics (Mobil 1) on my '88 924S
(62k miles). The manual calls for 80 weight and 90 weight respectively.
Any thoughts on other specs to improve shift quality/friction?

Also, any suggestions for accessories that improve "driving quality" not
necessarily pure performance. I.E. the replacement throttle cam, what do
people think of it? Any other ideas? I'm also thinking of a replacement
steering wheel that is flat on the bottom (make ingress and egress
easier).

Also, who makes the best dash cap? My car already has one, but it's not
installed very well. I'd also like to get one that gets rid of the
center speaker grill (there isn't a speaker behind it is there?).

My car has the very light interior and at some point the carpet in the
hatch got replaced by a black piece. Any suggestions on getting an OEM
replacement? Any ball park prices?

Also, how many volts should a fully charged car battery have? Mine is
about 12.1 volts or so, and it cranks kind of slow.

Does anyone know what the thread specs are for the brake/clutch bleeder
screws? I want to replace the bleeders with speed bleeders.
