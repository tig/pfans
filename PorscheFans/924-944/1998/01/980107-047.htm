I don't have a copy of the mag/booklet you refer to but if the process
and tool you are describing is "Indexing Spark Plugs" then yes, there
are minor gains to be had.  We use this process on a NASCAR Late model
with great accuracy because of the strict rules associated with engines
there.

Basically the process of indexing plugs is done to find out which plug's
electrode faces away from the valves (so the air/fuel mixture sprays
straight into the open side of the plug) when it is screwed all the way
into the cylinder.  This sometimes takes us +15 plugs on a typical V-8!
(realize we typically run fours)  Once the "usable" plugs are found,
simply screw the plugs into the correct cylider for that plug and
presto, an instant,slight (I've been told 10-15 hp on V-8) gain.

Again, the gains are minimal, but in tight rule racing, worth the extra
HP.  

The washer you refer is probably a cheap version of our presicion,
anodized indexer. 

One last note on the V plugs out there.  You know the ones with the
split electrodes.  They are a waste of time and money.  Under actual
conditions the split arc only lasts for about 2-3 minutes of running. 
Then the spark tends to favor one side or the other.  Which takes you
back to a one electrode plug with a thinner electrode.  Thinner means
less current travel and less HP.

I may not know s**t about Porsches, but I have worked extensivly on
NASCAR electonics.  Including ignitions.  Just my .02.
