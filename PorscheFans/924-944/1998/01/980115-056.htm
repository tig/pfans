A friend of mine had shock problems on his 944T and went to Koni for
warranty.  Their response was that if the shocks came delivered from
the factory on the car, the warranty is only for the period of the new
car warranty and that warranty would be served by the car manufacturer,
not by Koni.  However, after replacing them with new parts, you are
entitled to a lifetime warranty on the replacement as long as the
dealer/shop gives you a receipt.

Maybe Jason can shed some light if this is true or if my friend just
got screwed by a CS person having a bad day at Koni.
