6-8?!?!?! Eek. Around here each student gets one assigned instructor for
the entire weekend, and hopefully vice versa. Teaching a different random
student each run group sucks, imho.

Um, do you know how protective a helmet really is? :-)

I betcha your instructor can't even remember saying that :-) I know I made
a similar comment a few years back to a student in a 993, but I can't
remember what - I just remember the "Holy F***" feeling. (This was my first
experience with the 993 self-correcting rear axle. The student was going
through the Carrossel at Mont-Tremblant, taking the (safe, but slower
unless you get it perfect) double-apex line at a reasonable speed and
decided to lift in between apexes. Do this in a 911 and you're
agricultural. Do this in a 993 and the rear hops out 3-4", then toes-back
into the turn, with *NO* driver input. I was flabbergasted.)

Seriously though, our (PCA) region has had the implied philosophy for many
years that any time a student spins it is the instructor's fault.

Okay, first remember what Price says (in the same paragraph) - "turning
slows the car down" In other words, if all you do is move the wheel, the
car will slow down *more* than if you didn't. Similarly, there are two ways
of loading the front suspension, getting on the brakes, or, getting off the
accelerator.

So, if, like he wants, you're at 100% at the apex, there are many different
ways to get there, and if you can "go with the flow" (of the track), then
why not try it?

Um, what textbooks? Ever since Piero Taruffi defined the technique of Motor
Racing in, what, 1950?, all road-racing textbooks have included a neutral
phase.

What *has* changed is tire properties and ground-effects (and most of us
don't worry about ground-effects).

One has to be much more controlled and gentle on tires now to (usually) get
the most out of them. The theory hasn't changed, but the slip angles have.

Yes, but everyone should be willing to learn (and master) various techniques.

I hope you were able to tell the instructor off! You should have no qualms
about asking for a different instructor if you are having any kind of issue
with the one you were assigned. For the most part, instructors are
instructors because of their driving ability, not their teaching ability.
As a result, instructor/student interactions aren't perfect.

Hahahahaha! OTOH, I (and all of my students) have found going out together
but with me driving most helpful, if only to teach the instructor humility
(...er, yes, that's what happens when you turn in too quick, cough, hack...)

BadBob951 has asked about Centerforce clutches.  No one I know has tried one.
You all may recall that in the past I've posted about an '86 951 I drove which
has a Milledge-built, Motec-equipped 435 bhp motor.  For this application,
Milledge specified some sort of 935 clutch.  Most of the folks around here
with street/track or track only cars that aren't pumped up beyond 350 bhp go
with the Sachs HD unit.  I am not sure how much money the Centerforce clutch
would set you back, or what other changes (if any) are required, but I
wouldn't spend a dime more than the Sachs HD price unless my engine builder
said it was required.

Since I don't have an engine builder, and my cars make only maybe 280 ('89)
and  320 ('87) bhp, I'll stick with the Sachs.
