PorscheHQ has moved from http://www.sip.fi/~hawkeye to
http://porschehq.stip.net
I would like to thank all of you that have visited the site. PorscheHQ got
over 7600 visits in it's first year and that's a very good number when you
consider the site opened in May of '97.
  I'm putting a couple of new sections to the site and I would need your
help in one of them. The majority of the people who don't own a Porsche
really don't have any idea what they are like. I'm looking for Porsche
owners who could write a short report/story of their car and their
experience with it. This would be a huge help for anyone looking in joining
this great hobby. If you would be willing to write anything about your
car(doesn't have to be much), please mail the reports/stories to
porschehq@stip.net

PS. Oh yeah, you can also attach a picture of your car with the message.
