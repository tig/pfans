Sorry, I forgot about that one. The Pilot is supposed to be marginally
better but the SZ50 costs a lot less. I wasn't impressed when I drove
them because they were quite loose. Later on it has become well-known
that the SZ50 and the S02 tread compounds both suffer thru a greasy
period and I haven't re-driven the tire. Based on the enthusiastic
response I've heard, it is an excellent bang-for-the-buck "super" tire.

How's the tread life?

Does anyone have any 924 or 944 cheap Brown carpet to sell?
It doesn't have to be beautiful, its for the race car. I have the spare tire
cover mat, need the rest.
