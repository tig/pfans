I agree.  This game is awesome... just listening to the F1 announcers is
cool... and when you try to go _backwards_ on the track they come =
unglued!

My oldest son brought his Playstation and this game home during his
Christmas leave and I had a lot of fun with it, but found it very hard to
steer the cars without steering assist activated.  I guess I didn't have
enough experience as he made it look easy.  Hmmm, must be those years and
years of video game experience paying off... and the 27 years difference
in age :-)

>The game was pulled from the shelves a while back because Bernie wasn't
>happy with Psygnosis using the F1 name.

I believe they may be releasing a CART version soon.
