Clark, I suspect that there are differences between the early and later
944s as far as this wiring is concerned.  The factory wiring diagram for
the early 944 shows 3 switches and 2 of them are mounted (stacked together)
at the aft end of the cable drive rail (I had to adjust these after
replacing a broken lift arm cable).  This pair is adjustable along the
track and determine where the cable will stop.  One of the switches, as you
said, is up in the header between the sun visors.  The only other switch in
the circuit is the one on the console with which you actuate the roof
(really doesn't qualify as a microswitch eh?).  I'm sorry if my info
confused anyone with a later model car.

I'm getting ready to repace one front balljoint/a-arm on my 85.5 944. Is there
any reason why  these need to be done in pairs, like struts or springs? This
is  a street- only Porsche! Also, in the new Excellence some-one has rebuilt
A-Arms forr $200, which is $30-$60 cheeper than the normal lowest prices I've
seen in months. I don't recall if it was Zims or who (the mag is at the
office)
