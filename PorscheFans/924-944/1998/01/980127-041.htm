Need help.  From working on other engines I think I know what this thing
is, but not sure.  I have a turbo and it is located on the intake
manifold right above the throttle position sensor.  Anyway, I noticed it
had popped out last night!  The car was running pretty rough, but when I
put the screw back in it returned to normal.  The big question is: how
far do I screw it in?  I'm not sure how far to adjust it and the Haynes
manual doesn't even show it (like I expected anything else).  Plus, how
do I keep it in?  It is aufully loose in there.  It looks like it has an
o-ring on it that may be worn away which is why it is so loose, but I'm
not sure.  Do I need a new o-ring or is there some other way to get the
thing to stay put.  Help.
