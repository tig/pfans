There's a drip from the seam to the left of the driver's side 
sunshield.  

Any suggestions?

This is a repost to the 924/944 and 928 Lists:

The Porsche Club of America Zone 7 Autocross School is fast approaching!
Anyone is welcomed to sign up and attend, as long as they are driving a
Porsche.  I will post a notice to the 924/944 and 928 lists once a
registration process is announced, which should be in the next 30 days or so.

I cannot tell you how much fun this is-- you'll have to try it and see for
yourself.  It is worth planning a mini-vacation around, if you live within a
reasonable distance of the Bay Area.  This event always gets full almost
immediately (i.e, within a few weeks, if not days, after registration opens),
so stay tuned.  I ask that you do not bombard Masuo Robinson, event Co-Chair
(see below) with lengthy e-mails, however, you may contact him at the address
below.

Thanks again to Henry Watts, the original author of this post.  For those of
you who don't know Hank, he has written two books about cars.  One of them is
called Secrets of Solo Racing, which is all about AX and solo track event
driving.  Great
book-- makes an excellent gift.

Let's see some water pumpers out there!

>The dates have been set for the 1998 Zone 7 Beginner and Intermediate 
>Autocross School.  May 2 & 3 at Candlestick Park (3COM for the 
>infidels among you).  This 2-day school spends Saturday on basic
>exercises (skidpad, braking, decreasing-radius, linked turns, slalom, etc.)
>then features two autocross courses on Sunday.  Enrollment is limited
>to 90 students and it will fill up very fast once the notices hit the Zone
>7 regional newsletters in either the Jan or Feb issues.  There will be
>about 60 instructors, so the student-instructor ratio is very good.
>
>I can absolutely recommend this weekend as one of the best ways to
>get into competitive driving or to hone your skills.  I ran the school for
>a number of years.  Chairmen Masuo Robinson and Jeff Sykes took
>over last year.  All their changes have been for the better.
>
>We have had a number of people travel to the school from the southland
>and from Oregon/Washington.  Those who have done so reported that
>it was a worthwhile trip.  I would suggest that the Bay Area is a nice
>place to visit with your Porsche anyway, but the school schedule is
>pretty strenuous with lots of course time and no one's going to want
>to party very much either evening.

>Cost is $90.
