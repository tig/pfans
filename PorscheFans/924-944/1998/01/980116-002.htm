Well, a few people seemed interested in my car, but all were too far away.
 In the event that someone missed the message the first time around, here
it is again.  Sorry for posting this twice, but I really don't want to see
the car go to a junkyard.

Everything is in working order (the car runs, although the battery's
probably dead by now) except for the transmission (which is actually
working as of this moment, but probably will not remain so).  This is a
'79 924 that didn't even make it to its first regular oil change after
having the engine rebuilt.  All body parts are usable, if not very good. 
The glass is all unbroken, so if anyone out there has cracked hatch glass,
you might be interested in this.

The clutch is perfect (as near as I can tell), the engine leaks a small
bit of oil from the oil pressure sender (because I didn't screw it in
tight enough and never had a chance to do so), all gauges work, the fuel
pump doesn't have many miles on it, and if I suspect the fuel distributor
doesn't work real well, it gets the job done.  The suspension should be
good (a visual inspection of the parts that could break reveal no broken
parts - front and rear sway bars look good), the brakes have lots of miles
left, both power windows work, both power mirrors work, the differential
is fine (the problem is definitely in the transmission), the exhaust
system (if you want it) seems in good shape, the spare tire (crappy type)
is present for any 924 councours types out there who need it, the radiator
is in good (excellent? no dents, it cools, and doesn't leak) shape, and
there's lots more stuff in small parts you may need.

The transmission failure occurred in the past and the PO had the
transmission sort-of rebuilt (the mechanic shortened some transmission
part from a 911 and welded (!) it in so the car would run).  The plan was
for it to last a year, until she could buy a new car.  It lasted about
five.  I think we can rest assured that it was simply luck the
transmission lasted this long and that it wasn't something in another part
of the car going wrong that caused it to die.

The car is in Chicopee (Western), MA, but I could probably move it to
Enfield (Extreme Northern), CT if it were critical.  I'm almost willing to
give the car away for nothing if you come and get the whole thing.  I'll
feel better if the car (or part of it) is being used than if I have to
junk it, and we just haven't got the space to store it at home.

Anyway, please let me know.  And if you know a shop that services lots of
924's, or someone who has one but isn't on the list, let him or her know
about this.  I'll freely admit that I'm desperate for someone to take my
poor 924 off my hands.
