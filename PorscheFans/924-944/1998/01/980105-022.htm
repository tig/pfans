Howdy,

Just wanted to say thanks for giving me that weight information, it really
is appreciated.

Now, for a few more questions:
1. How do you take the door panel off on a normal door 951 (not the big
   speaker package door).  I have something rattling around in there I
   want to take care of.
2. How do chipped 951's do on the track against ZR-1's.  Assume that the
   ZR-1 is driven very well.  How about a slightly modified ZR-1 with
   parts such as intake/exhaust from Lingenfelter.  The car in question
   is a 89, 90 or 91 (can't remember).  The stats show anywhere from
   105mph to 109mph in the 1/4 which means it has some serious power,
   but wonder how they stack up in the bends.

Mark, Paul's brother picked up his 87 951 over the weekend.  It still
amazes me how beautiful these cars are.  It was sitting in the garage
next to Paul's 951 and it was a neat site with both garage doors open,
two 951's.  It might be a sign that I'm getting older, but the 928
is starting to appeal to me.  I think, to have the perfect garage, you'd
need some air cooled version, maybe an RS America, an 89 951, a 928 GTS,
and a Mercedes E420 . . . one day :)

As a reference point, he paid C$16,250 for his 87, stock everything,
even tires from the wear of them.  The car has 60,000 miles or so.
It's a very clean car though with a nice sounding motor, no unusual
noises, just nice a smooth.

Can't wait to stick some chips in it :)  We're going to use the Milledge
units on his car and dyno test them to see how much they produce.

Farzaan.
