Hello Jeff,

This is a fairly straight-forward procedure, and is a good project
for a DIY (Do It Yourself). For tools, you'll need:

good jack and jackstands (2)
large pliers (channel lock)
needle-nose pliers
large philips screwdriver
metric allen wrench (10mm I think) Make sure you have the
  socketed ones, not just the L shaped ones
metric box end wrenches
19mm socket
an old wire coat hanger
spray brake clean
anti-squeal spray or gel
lots of rags
some old cardboard boxes
anti-sieze / WD-40 type stuff
goggles
rubber gloves

I also recommend that you change the brake fluid. Since you're in there
anyway. Finally, I'm not a big fan of the OEM pads.  IMHO, they are too
much money (even with the new prices), create too much dust, and don't
work all that well when hot.  For street / autocross use, I'm a big fan
of Axxis MetalMaster pads. They're much cheaper (like $35 for the
fronts), don't create as much dust, and work great. One last point,
you'll be able to get everything (including the pads and brake fluid)
from mail order places for A LOT less than dealer.  I'm not trying to
knock the dealer, and if you have a good one near home by all means use
them. Unfortunately, I'm not that lucky. For example, when I did the
timing and balance belt, the mail order places (Zimms) had both belts
for about $35. The dealer was around $100.

Anyway, brake change Procedures:

1. Jack car and put on jack stands (left as an excersize to
   the reader)
2. Remove both front wheels (19mm socket, be sure to loosen lug
   nuts before jacking car).
3. Place an open cardboard box under the brake assembly, put on
   your goggles. Spray the brake clean liberally on the brake
   caliper. Use rags to clean things up.
4. Open brake caliper retaining spring.
   This is the metal wire that is sort of cross shaped. Use the large
   pliers to compress the middle of the cross. You'll see the top end
   of the spring retract from the caliper. Now you can rotate the spring
   away from the caliper.
5. Remove old brake pad wear sensors
   These are the thin wires that look to be embedded in the brake
   pads. If you look carefully, you'll find that the wear sensors are
   clipped into the pads. Use the needle-nose pliers to remove the
   wear sensors. Trace the wires back to the connector (a round tube).
   Open the connector box, remove the old wear sensor, install the
   new sensor, close the connector).
6. Remove old brake pads
   You might have to retract the caliper pistons a little to make
   this possible. If so, place a rag or some cardboard on the outer
   side of the caliper, grab the top of the pad, and squeeze with
   the large pliers. Now you can grab the pad with the pliers, and
   remove from the caliper.
7. Remove the caliper from the steering knuckle
   This may be different depending on your model. The caliper is
   attached to the knuckle with either 2 hex head bolts, or two allen
   head bolts. The head head bolts are located on the back side of
   the caliper, near the brake line. The hex head bolts are on 
   the 'top' of the caliper, on the same 'face' as the spring.
   
   These bolts may be tight. Use constant pressure to remove them.

   After the bolts have been removed, support the caliper with
   the wire hanger. Do not let the caliper dangle on the brake line.

8. Remove the brake rotor. The rotor is held with two philips
   screws. The screws are on the 'face' of the rotor. Remove the
   screws and pull the rotor off. You might need to hit the rotor  
   with a mallet.

9. Installation is the reverse!

10. After you install new pads, you should flush the brake fluid.
    I'll let some one else cover that.

ENJOY! You just learned a lot about your car, yourself, and hopefully
saved some money. 

ONE FINAL NOTE!! After everything is put back together, be sure to pump 
the brakes a few times BEFORE you start driving. The pads have to 
get seated against the new rotor. 

Don't make any sudden stops for a while. The pads have to work into 
the new rotors. 

If you kill yourself, it's not my fault!
