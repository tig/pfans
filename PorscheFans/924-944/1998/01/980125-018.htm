I am still tinkering with my 81 924 Porsche toy in anticipation of the
coming summer.  That big sunroof is almost like having a convertible! 
My window and door rubber parts have practically rotted off.  Can
someone recommend a resonable replacement solution?  The plastic pieces
which latchdown the sunroof to the car are broken from years of use as
well.  This is a manual lift off sunroof.  Can someone recommend a
solution for this?  I would love to purchase new parts for both of these
items if someone know where I can get them.  I am having problems with
the pop up lights to the extent that they do not come up reliably.  Most
times I have to lightly bump an stationary object like the garage or a
parking column to get them to come up.  What is the deal?  

Thanks for your help in advance...
