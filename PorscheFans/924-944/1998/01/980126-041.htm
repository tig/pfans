Hello David,

>     I decided to change the belts and rollers last weekend. I forgot 

Let's see, since 1/1/98, I have helped change the timing and balance 
belts on 3 951's, my 89, my friends 89, and another friends 87 (this 
past saturday).

When the motor is placed at TDC, four things should happen:
1. The mark on the cam pulley should be aligned with the mark on
the inner cam cover
2. The upper balance shaft gear mark should align with the mark on 
the inner cover.
3. The lower balance shaft gear should align with the plastic ridge
on the inner cover.
4. The mark on the flywheel (OT) should be visible in the opening 
on the bellhousing on top of the motor.

Yes, that is the picture. The opening is so small that if you can
see the OT, you are at TDC. There is a small mark that goes across
the opening, but the opening is so small that once I can see OT,
I'm happy.

Is the balance shaft properly tensioned? An 1/8 of an inch is pretty
small, that's less than one tooth. I suggest you turn the motor
over a few times, reset it to TDC and see how the marks line up.
On my car, I had trouble getting the lower balance gear to line
up. After the motor was rotated a few times, the mark lined up
properly.

The only problem we had with the belts was due to the silly
autotensioner. It's a real PIA to either remove and install
the thing, or to pull it away from the motor far enough to
get the belt out and then back in. I'm looking for hints for
that one.
