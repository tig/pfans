Howdy,

The warranty company has accepted the claim for the control arms and CV
Joints, or in other words, the warranty company just made my weekend :)

They would like us to use a "better quality" control arm this time, so
they are willing to pay a bit extra for the motorsport arms or Fabcar or
whatever.  After debating it for a while, I've decided against the
Fabcar for various reasons and instead am focusing on the factory motorsport
arms.

We've so far contacted Porsche Motorsport North America, they gave us a
contact in Germany's motorsport department.  We contacted them and they
do not have any in stock either.  We then contacted Kelly Moss who has
one set of used ones in stock that have been zygloed (sp?).  We are
currently trying Andial and probably John Milledge.  Anyone have a source
for new Motorsport arms?

With the warranty company insisting that I get a better arm, I don't want
to disapoint them and get just new factory ones :)

Farzaan.
