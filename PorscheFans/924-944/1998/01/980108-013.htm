Tony,

There is no cable on the 944 speedometer, it's electronic.  The instrument
cluster is actually easy to remove, once you get to it.  You have to first
remove the entire trim piece around it, which also has the A/C vents molded
into it.  There should be two small screws at the top of the instrument
cluster, in the trim piece.  There are two more just in front of the
steering wheel, on both sides of the dash, below the instrument cluster.
And another on the far right of the trim, inside the air vent.  With these
removed, the panel should come off.  Be careful around the steering wheel,
not to scratch it or the column.  After that, you should be able to see the
screws securing the instrument cluster.  Remove those and slowly pull the
cluster out, left side first.  Unplug the connectors from the back, and
you're done.  Also, be very careful with the instrument cluster -- the
plastic scratches easily.

Once removed, you can send it to Speedometer Service (972)380-8944 or
Overseas Speedometer (800)444-0292, both in Texas, or North Hollywood
Speedometer (818)761-5136 in California.  You can request that they polish
the plastic, if it has any scratches, while they are repairing it. Or, you
can take it to a plastics shop yourself -- it's amazing what a difference it
makes.

One final note -- odometer failures are sometimes the result of tampering.
You may want to investigate.  If the car has been serviced a dealership,
there should be a computer log showing service dates and mileage that can be
accessed by any Porsche dealer.  There are also places on the internet that
can search for data using the VIN.

Anyway...  hope this info helps.

Tony Golden

Subject: Broken Odometer

Does anyone know the procedures for removing the speedometer on a 1990 944
S2. The odometer has stopped working. I looked under the dash to see if
there was a loose cable but I didn't see one. Is this normal? If so, how
does this work? Any help would be appreciated. Also are there any shops
that specialize in repairing speedometers (I'm in Jersey City, NJ)? Are
rebuilt or new speedometers available? Can you pass along some names of
vendors.

Thanks
Tony
