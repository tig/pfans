Wow, your car sounds like it is identical to mine!  Same color, same rims,
same tires!  So, what color is your interior?  :-)

Where do you have the subs?  Did you cut part of the trunk?

I think I am the only one here who owns both of the cars in question.  My
heart still belongs to my baby, M3, but the 951 (944 turbo) is one hell of
a car.  It is pretty obvious that the 951 offers much more performance
bang-for-the-buck.  In stock form, the E30 M3 has a much better feel, but
the 951 will flat-out beat one in almost all conditions (except possibly a
tight track or autocross.)  The other advantage the 951 has is that with
only the addition of bolt on modifications (chips, exhaust, MAS, etc..) the
951 becomes a car that can beat some of the most exotic cars on the road...
 When my girl friend decided she wanted a track/weekend car we quickly
decided the the M3 was out of the question.  It cost too much in comparison
to the 951.  We have now found a 90K '86 951 black/black that we will
probably get for $8K.  The car is being checked by a mechanic while I
type...  Of course, her first choice was the M3, but the 951 grows on you
quickly (especially when you push the gas pedal.)  It is clear to me that
my 951 is *MUCH* quicker and faster tham my M3, but it doesn't have that
tight and nimble handling feeling that I love about my M3.  The bottom line
is that I love them both, but I think the 951 is a much better value (if
you can find a nice one which is quite hard.)

>The only costly problem I've had is a blown head gasket.  Other than that

What's not to love!?!  The M3 is an awesome car, with great looks, and fun
engine, and  handling to match!
