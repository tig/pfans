Does anyone have a written procedure for changing the front pads on 89
944T.  My Haynes manual says special tools are required and to take it
to dealer.  Is this true?  Is it any harder than a normal GM Pad
change?  Any help appreciated.  Thanks.

Randall Morton

Actually, Chris, I have devised a way to continuously spray a fine mist of
Coke in through that inspection hole onto the clutch, using a windshield
washer pump.  I too recommend Classic, in the one liter plastic container,
which mounts nicely in the right side of the engine compartment.  I get much
better clutch life, plus about 50 miles to the liter.  Your mileage may vary.

(Uh oh, I remember the reaction a few weeks ago to Nick's suggested engine
mods--hey, it's a joke.)

I have not actually traced the leak in my steering system yet (924S), other
than to check the resevoir hoses, and tighten them. I have a bad feeling that
it is leaking inside the rack and that when I unblamp one of the bellows I
will find lots of red fluid. I have heard that this means rack replacement,
but I have had other cars, a peugeuot in particular, on which this was fixed
with a rebuild kit which contained new seals for the control valve part of the
rack. I have also heard that other cars (a saab in this case) will not benefit
from such a treatment, and I had to replace the rack. So, IS there any kind of
kit available for this rack? The rebuilders must be using something. I am not
afraid to work on it, and would be happy to gamble a few bucks on seals and my
own labor to try to dry this sucker up. Also, could the leak be coming form
the hose that runs behind the rack, which is protected by some sort of tubing
(ie leak in the hose inside the tubing)

I seem to have the typical noise from my new balance belt. (97 924S) Its not
all that bad, and I may well ignore it and see if it dissapears after some
break in time. I did replace the rollers, and the old belt was quite loose,
but seemed to be working fine. According to the factory manual, it seems the
idler roller for this belt is to be set so that there is a half milimeter gap
from roller to belt as it goes around lower balance shaft sprocket, and at the
same time the roller should be deflecting the long span of the belt above half
to one millimeter. This is how I have it set up, but considering that this
requires a belt tooth slapping this roller every millisecond, I have to wonder
if this is really what they mean, or if perhaps they have changed the setting
to zero deflection or even a slight gap. I assume this roller serves to
prevent both tooth jumping on the sprocket below, which does not wrap around
much, and slapping of the belt above the roller, which the old one did a lot
of due to looseness, to the extent of rubbing a line in the water pump pulley
(pump also replaced, by the way). Anyone have any thoughts on this. If its
still making noise after a thousand miles I may just go ahead and reduce the
deflection to zero (and reset tension)
