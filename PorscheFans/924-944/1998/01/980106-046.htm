I believe that both Jim Pasha and Smokey Yanick (OK, so he doesn't
specialize in Porsches) have recommended checking the orientation of plug
electrodes.  If I recall correctly, the open end of the electrode should be
facing down on a 944.  The factory may have incorporated the idea into the
design, but the problem is that the spark plug threads might not always
cooperate. I believe the theory behind all this is that you don't want to
shroud the spark from the central air/fuel mixture.  Has anyone tried this
and found a difference in performance?

BTW, is Bosch still making those open 3-electrode plugs? Seems like that
would take care of any plug orientation problems.
