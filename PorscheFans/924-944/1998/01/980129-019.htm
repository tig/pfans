I learned my lesson years ago when I tried to take a 35 mph curve at about
80.  After doing no less then five alternating skids including one of
approximately 170 degrees I fortunately managed to stop without damage. 
Upon inspecting the skid marks on the road we discovered one a mere two
feet from the high bank of the curve that led to a forty foot drop down the
side of the hill.  Now I just let the idiots go on their way but I must
admit at times it is very tempting.  The car I was driving was rear engined
and air cooled and suffered from oversteer....................a Corvair.
