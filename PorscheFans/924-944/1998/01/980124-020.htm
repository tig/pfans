>Alyn,
>If you haven't tried this, first try screwing down tightly the plastic
>dook-lock covers. Occasionally, this is all that is necessary to fix the
>problem.
>If you are removing trim, a special tool (I got one from SnapOn) is
>available for removing the hiddenplastic plug-ins (my term) at the bottom
of
>the door, but this tool is really not necessary.  First disconnect the
>battery. Two putty knives inserted of either side of the plastic plug-ins
>between the door and the panel should enable you to pop the bottom of the
>panel systematically without tearing the top of the plug from the panel.
>Removal of the screws is self-evident.  Two screws have plastic caps.  If
>you take your time with these, no marks will be made.  Work slowly and
>carefully from back to front when working with the hidden plastic plug-ins.
>First, my recommendation for power window switches:   If you have power
>windows, a putty knives also work well to pry the switch loose from both
>lateral sides of the trim.  If done slowly, the plastic trim, switches, and
>the brass spring clips will come out by hand as a unit.  Probably, the
first
>time one eases out the switches, the spring clips will fall inside the
>door--where they can be recovered easily when the panel is removed.
>Second, Porsche's  recommendation for power window switches:  Press in the
>top of push-button on the switich (as if you were raising the window) and
>insert a small putty knife between the trim and the bottom of the switch.
>Remove the switch and disconnect the plugs.  (I do not use this method
>because occasionally a switch will fly apart with the ball bearings,
>springs, and lever tabs popping loose.  The lever tabs are not symmetrical,
>and one has to study a wiring diagram to see the correct orientation for
>re-insertion.)
>The job is not at all difficult, and I am no master mechanic, but it should
>be done slowly and carefully the first time.

>>My 85 944 has rattles in both doors, near the locking mechanism. Before I
>>remove the inner panels has anyone been here already? Any points about
>>removing the trim? Is this rattle a common ailment on older 944s?
