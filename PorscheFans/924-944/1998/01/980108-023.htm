I have my radiator out while I am in the process of a belt change and
wondered if there was any maintenance I should do while I have it out
besides flushing with water.
thanks

Hi Porschefans,
     I have an 83 944 that I am currently changing belts, pulleys, and engine
seals on.  Last night, I was attempting to remove the lower balance shaft
front support.  Evidently, a leaking water pump some years ago, had corroded
one of the three bolts that attach it to the engine block.  To make a long
story short, two out of three bolts came out.  Half of the third bolt is out
of the car and half is still in the block.  :)  The bolt sheared right at the
beginning of the threads.  About a 1/4 inch of the bolt is sticking out of the
engine block. 
     What is the best way to remove this?  I fear that the threads are
stripped as well.  Can someone help me out with this?  Will I need to drill
and tap the threads?  TIA,
Casey Fox
