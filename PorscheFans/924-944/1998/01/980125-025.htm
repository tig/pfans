Hi, 
This is in reference to the 924 that European Auto 
Mag. tried to "plump up":
The air filter, exhaust, valve timing, big throat (I don't
remember which big throat), were added to a car that had 
a bent distributor shaft....that may have been part of the 
reason that "no increase in power" was measured. I would
really not go by what they said. Also, the 924 that they were 
playing with was "destroyed"...(they never said HOW) before
they could do any further testing.
I live on the Redwood coast, so dynos are not available.
Subjectivly though, I CAN tell you that a K&N air filter and 
a Neuspeed throttle-body WILL allow a '78 924 to pass a
logging truck (doing 70MPH) on a serious hill. THIS
924 was in good running condition before the K&N, and
Neuspeed throttle body were added however.
This is my first week with the Neuspeed setup, and haven't
seen any downside to it yet...also it is CA smog legal.
