I don't know what was supposed to be in those "<>"s, but if it's referring
to my comment, I certainly wasn't suggesting that riding w/ instructors
should be replaced by turning rookies loose in the experienced group.  With
advanced beginners on a not-too-technical track with lots of runoff room,
I've seen it improve lap times.  If a driver has developed enough poise,
appreciates the limitations of his skill and his car, and knows reflexively
how to let other drivers pass,  it's a method that can be sometimes used. 
The point is not to try to outrun better drivers, but rather to stay behind
them for a half a lap and get a sense of their rhythm and pace. I guess
what I'm saying is that after a year or so of experience, a driver who's
gotten advice from a variety of instructors can benefit from ocassionally
running with a more advanced group.  I've done this, and it's beneficial. 
I had to worry more about their mistakes than they did mine, and I was
quick to let the faster cars/better drivers pass. 

As far as getting hurt by the "big dogs", it can be more dangerous
following a rookie into a corner as he panics and lifts off the brakes. 
The big dogs may push you harder, but their reflexes are (hopefully)
better.

My suggestion assumed that a driver has learned the difference in lines
taken by 944s, 914s and 911s.  I've also followed a better 914-6 driver
into corners, using a 944 line, and was delighted that I caught him on the
exit, even tho he had the inside front tire 8 inches off the ground trying
to keep ahead. What I learned was he really knew how to use his car, and
someday I'll know how to push mine to the limit.  It didn't make me feel
like the better driver.  I passed him on a straight, and then slowed to let
him by on the next one because I knew a couldn't keep up with his pace for
too many laps and I would be blocking him in corners.  It all comes down to
track manners and predictablity.

OK. I admit. The suggestion was unorthodox.

Amen.
