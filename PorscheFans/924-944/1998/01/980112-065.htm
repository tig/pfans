David J.,          I had a little trouble reading the post(Hey! I
thought you fixed that problem?) but I believe the 1mm headgasket is
considerably thinner than the the stock gasket. Also, I ran across an
interesting bit of info on injectors if your interested, if not, there`s
always the delete button. It seems there is basically 2 types of Bosch
injectors : The Saturation type and the Peak and Hold type. The
Saturation type has a resistance of approx. 16 ohms. This injector is
turned on when the DME essentially grounds one side of  the injector for
the duration of the desired on- time(pulse width). As I`m sure your
already aware, this pulse width is usually about couple thousandths of a
second(2mS). This means the driver transistor for 2 injectors is
continuously switching about 1.7 amps(13.5V/8R).   The Peak & Hold type
have a resistance of approx. 1.8 ohms. These injectors are turned on
when the DME  initially grounds the injector to snap it open but then
imediately limits current to a level just high enough to keep the
injector open for the required on-time. Again, this all happens in a
couple thousandths of a second. This means the driver transistor for two
of these injectors is initially switching 15 amps! continuously. Early
944`S have Saturation injectors, later 944`S have the Peak & Hold type.
Obviously you would not want to accidently put the low resistance type
into an early application as this may cause smoke to appear from
undesirable places. It is interesting to note: Both DME`s have current
limiters on the injector drivers. When the fuel pressure gets to
high(blown regulator), the DME doesn`t run out of power, it  simply goes
into current limit and won`t  hold the injectors open. One more thing to
ponder; G.M. puts Peak & Hold injectors with the nonfouling Multec tips
into their 180HP. 2.3L n/a Quad four applications. Guess what, they fit
right into the Porsche fuel rails and are half the price.  I better duck
and run now       Dave C.

Well, what about any other hallucinogenic substances?
