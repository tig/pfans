You all also might want to check out the Road&Track "On Porsche"
publication.  It has road tests and stuff from 1985-1988, including an
'at the track' comparo of the 944, 924S, 944S, and 944T.  Also has
a great section on RX-7 vs. 944 at the track.  Guess which one was
faster.

I have a set of Phone Dials off of my early '86 951 (23 mm offset) which will
be retired this winter when I swap the suspension with that of a 968.  These
wheels have Dunlop D40 M2's with about 4,000 miles on them ($850.00 plus
shipping).  I also have a set of Fuchs which have fresh Graphite paint on the
centers.  The Fuchs have had their worn R1's removed this weekend ($1,200 plus
shipping).  Both sets include center caps.

Three of the Phone Dials are in very good original condition.  One front wheel
had been purchased used and had Wurth Aluminum paint/clear lacquer applied to
it.  The wheel looks great but the finish is not original.

The Fuchs are outstanding track wheels.  They look great with their new paint.
Spacers thicker than 1/4" need to be used on the front wheels in order for
them to clear the calipers on a 951.  Spacers will be included.  Please ask
for them.

I have a black steering wheel that is in absolutely perfect condition from an
'86 951.  The price for this is $175.00.

I have a glove box door, black, that is perfect except that the two stops are
broken off.

I have a heat/AC control unit with a non-functioning "snow flake switch."

I have sway bars - front and rear - off of an '86 951.  These make terrific
upgrades for stock 944's.

I will have 4,000 mile old factory sport struts (Sachs, black) when I change
the suspension ($ make offer).  I will also have 4,000 mile old Koni rear
shocks (non-adjustable, $75.00) .

I will have 4,000 mile old rotors, front and rear, with coordinating Pagid
pads (green).

I will have the complete suspension available in February.

Buyer pays for UPS shipping charges.  I can run a charge on either a VISA or
MasterCard to save the buyer COD charges.

If you are interested please call me in at my office in New Jersey (973)
694-0665 between 7:00 am and 5:30 pm.

Dear Don,

I am a dedicated Porsche Fans newsletter reader.  I appreciate your comments
to other list members and value your knowledge and expertise.  Please help me
sort through my position and offer your advice.

I have owned an '86 951 for nine years.  Last spring I had ProtoSport of
Pompton Plains, NJ (a Porsche only performance shop you are likely familiar
with.  They advertise in Excellence under their CA address of Protomotive)
work my car over.  In addition to much needed maintence they completed the
following upgrades for me, with which I am very satisfied:

New rotors all around w/ Pagid (green) pads.
Stainless steel brake lines.
Mass-flow kit w/ software.
A pair of Bosch fuel pumps.
Custom rising rate fuel pressure regulator.
K&N cone air filter.
Sparco Pro 2000 drivers seat w/ six point harness.
Brey Kraus strut tower brace.
Factory 30 mm front and 19 mm three way adjustable rear sway bars.
Swepco gear lube.
Upgraded to 968 engine mounts.

The car seems to be burning a bit more oil now than before and I have the
performance itch again so....  This winter I plan on having them do a ring
job, copper head gasket, raceware head studs, upgrade the turbo to a ball
bearing model (hopefully more effecient and with higher output), port and
polish the intake manifold and head if you think it is worth it, replace the
front brakes with Porsche "Big Red" calipers, sloted rotors, and stock pads,
re-locate the front brakes to the rear, and change the suspension to a 968
setup with double adjustable Koni's and progressive rate springs.  I plan on
ordering a set of Fiske FM-10s 7" & 9" x 17" w/ Michelin Pilot MMX's because I
will be changing the wheel offset.  ( I also own a bone stock '92 968
cabriolet - which will stay that way for as long as I own it - and am
interested in sharing my "street wheels" between the two cars.  It too needs
new rubber.)  I also plan on having a full RaceTech cage installed.  While the
engine is out should I replace my 5,000 mile old, stock Sachs, abused on the
auto-x, clutch with a Sachs Power Clutch?

I plan on doing driver's ed events this year in addition to continuing to
autocross the car.  I also enjoy using it as a source of transportation.  I
love the additional power of the mass flow kit but I wonder how much of an
improvement it makes over a "chipped only" car.  ProtoSport estimates the HP
to be a bit over 300.  I will also consider changing the car to pressure
sensing if ProtoSport can demonstrate a working unit before my car goes back
togther.  I am under the impression that this will decrease the turbo lag by
eliminating the gate in the air flow sensor.  I am also under the impression
that this will allow me to be more competitive in the M-4 class on the auto-X
circuit.  (I have a hard time competing with the race prepared 914's -
partially because my driving skills have so much room for improvement.)  I am
in this for the long haul and truly enjoy this sport.  As I learn more I hope
to participate in club racing.

I think I am asking for quite a bit here but please offer your input on these
engine and suspension setup/brake modifications.  Which do you recommend and
which would you avoid?  Are there any other modifications I should consider or
am I out of my mind even considering these?  How about a 968 trans-axle?

If you do engine re-builds and machine work I would consider shipping you the
motor.  ProtoSport does complete re-builds and some machine work but they
outsource the work for the copper head gasket and the porting and polishing if
I choose to do that (they indicated that the porting and polishing would offer
a bit more hp on the top end but no other significant improvements).

Thank you in advance for your anticipated reply.  Please E-mail me directly so
I don't accidently miss your response.  Comments from others appreciated as
well.

Yours truly,

John VanDerStad
