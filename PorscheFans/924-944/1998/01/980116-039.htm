<< Where are people mounting an oil temp gauge? Easy DIY? TIA >>

I mounted mine in the compartment under the radio.  I removed the compartment
and manufactured a plate which holds my oil temp and boost gauge (both are 2"
gauges, I don't think anything bigger will fit).  There is enough space to
include another 2" gauge (probably will be an EGT gauge, not sure yet).  I
haven't run the wiring yet.  For the sensor, I drilled out an oil drain plug
and threaded it.

All,

This is probably a George/Don type of question (so do you guys feel idolizedor
what?).  The '86 951 A-arms are slightly shorter than the '87 and later 951 A-
arms.  Are the sway bar (or stabilizer bar) mounting pionts in the same place
on the 2 different a-arms? (i.e., are the sway/stabilizer bars
interchangable?).  As far as I know they are, but I'ld hate to buy another
bar, pull everyting apart, then find out it doesn't fit!

TIA,
Bob

PS:  Does anyone have a spare M030 sway bar lying around?

All,

Unfortunately I'm about to have my rear wheel straightened because I hit a
monster pothole a couple of months ago.   I had a front wheel straightened a
couple of months ago when I hit a pothole.  The rear wheel was slightly bent
on the inside rim from that pothole and I didn't notice it until a couple of
days ago when I had to swap wheels front to back because the tire shop gave me
a free tire rotation.

My question is how much harder would it be to bend a forged rim as opposed to
my Phonedials?  Would a set of Fuchs survived without damage?  I realize it's
impossible to rate the extent of damage from my pothole from this message, but
I'm just looking for input on the strength differential for the two types of
rims.

All,

I recently installed new D40 M2's (dunlop).  Actually the fronts went on a
couple of weeks ago, and the rears went on a few days ago.  I've got serios
vibration/shimmy in the front at 60 and about.  Maxes out at about 75-80 and
stays about that up to 130+.  I took the car to my alignment guy  today and
had him check the rims and tires for straightness/roundness.  As you may
expect from my previous post about rims, one of the rims was slightly bent
(the rear one I knew about).  The other three were straight (including the
front rim I had straightened a month or so ago).  All 4 tires were slightly
out of round.  Yes.  New out of round tires.

I called Tire Rack and they said to have the tire shop that mounted them to
remove the tires and rotate 180 degrees to offset the highspot.  I checked out
thier webpage and there's a pretty good discription balanceing and they
mentioned the deal with rotating the tire 180deg. on the rim to offset the
highspots of the rim and tire.  They mentioned the term "runout" which I'm not
certian I understand.  Can anyone shed some light on exactly what "runout"
means?

PS:  I think this may fix my vibrations. why? Interestingly enough, when the
balanced the new tires, they added weight to the same area of the wheel, so
there is more than twice as much weight to balance the tires now.

In a message dated 98-01-15 15:37:08 EST, you write:

<< Is this the "cycling valve"?  Do you have the part number? >>

No.  The cycling valve is located under the intake manifold between the 3/4
(or is it 1/2) intake runner and modulates the amount of pressure the
wastegate diaphram is supplied.  The cutoff valve (or turbo bypass valve or
turbo popoff valve) is located on the intake boot next to the coolant resevoir
and is about the size of a film canister and opens up to let intake air
circulate through the turbo when the throttle is closed.
