Hi Bill,

You will want to make a decsion about either paying someone to press out
the old races and press in the new ones OR you can pound them out yourself.

If you do it yourself you will be well served if you find/buy a brass drift
at least 3/8" in diameter. Remove the rotor from the hub, clean the grease
off, wrap it up in aluminum foil and bake it in the oven at 250F for about
30 minutes. Take the hub out of the oven and use the brass drift to work
around the circumference of the race from the back side to gently tap it
out. Wiping a little WD40 on the inside of the hub will help it slide out.

Clean the race seat in the hub and while the hub is still hot tap in the
new race using the same technique (from the front of course). Again the
WD40 will help the thing slide a little better. Go slow at first to prevent
the race from cocking in the hub.

This can be done cold but in my experience the expansion of the hub from
the heating makes the job go much faster.

The brass drift is essential to keep from ripping a gouge in the hub, but
be mindful of the potential. Also a hardened steel punch or drift has the
potential to chip the race.

Have fun, it is a quick job (even for me).

Doug
