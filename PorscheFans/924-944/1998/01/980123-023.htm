	Been There had that, fixed it in both 944's

	Leak is from the battery box up front !

	Look under the and around the battery, trick is to put a shop light
under dash with car in dark and watch were the light comes out (water goes
in there). Many fixes from a coat of epoxy to welding in new metal, best I
heard was a coat of the heavy rubbish plastic they sell to coat tool grips.

	I have just discovered a pool of water under the carpet in the rear
	passenger seat. It is rainwater coming in from an unknown leak in
the body.
	If anyone has had a similar problem and has a fix please let me
know.


	Thanks,
