 Hi Guys oops, and Gals
I recently saw the posting from Matt Harrison saying:
<Anyone have a good anti-virus prigram>  in reguards to his girlfriend v3.0
   
My old girlfriend v.3.0 was somewhat lacking.  If I could have foundout what OS
she ran under I might have been able to diagnose the problem.  First thigs I
noticed about here were:
 A: If she ran in an IBM format I think BASIC would be the language of choice.
B: If she ran in Mac. format she would have been around 6.0.7.
She had the visual interface of a top of the line program, however as I soon
found out 
Her source code had been given to a whole lot of people, ie a lot have people
have 
been able to "dink" with her program.  I think you know what I mean.  A program
which I 
later found was infected with a virus.  Good thing I never "ran her program" as
virus could
have spread.  I also found her to be lacking in Processor speed, and avilable
RAM.

On a lighter note I upgraded to G-friend v4.0 which has recently gone through a
revision
to become Fiance' v1.0  which hopefully will be the last of my upgrades except
for the 
final upgrade to Wife v1.0
Originally now Fiance' would get very upset when I decided to work on any of my
cars.
after searching for a way to find a happy middle ground, it came to me.  Turn
G-friend
in to psudo-greesemonkey!!  It was actually easier than you think.  I managed
to find a 
book titled "Every thing you ever wanted to know about cars but were afraid to
ask"
or something close to that, its been a while. After she read that she came to
be more 
interested, and began reading the Automotive Encyclopedia. WOW was that a shock
now she helps me wrench all the cars. 55 Ford street rod, 85 944, and 81
DeLorean.

I know this revision doesn't work on all versions of G-Friend but it might
help. 
If nothing else, she can pass you tools while you are under the car:-)
Call me a softie, but I figured If I love my cars AND my Fiance' I had to find
a way for us
all to get along!!  She is a little upset all the cars have female names, but
oh well..
As for Features of the Fiance 1.0 I find her proram to be very solid, Her
visual interface to
be very pleasing, and plenty of RAM for future revisions.

Sorry if this was too long but I couldn't resist. OH by the way Roxanne: would
this earn 
brownie points or what? Just wanted you to know you share the name of my 944 as
"ROXY"
shes been named that long before I joined the list so its not a pick-up:-)

Safe driving to all
