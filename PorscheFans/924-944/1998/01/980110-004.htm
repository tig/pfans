Most likely source for water in the passenger footwell is from the the
battery tray.  This problem is quite comkmon on 924/944's.  Usually, it
is due to rust/corrosion from the battery, but in some cases, the tray
will just crack.  This is positioned right above the DME and alarm
control units on the 85/2- cars, so water can cause intermitten no-start
problems by damaging the alarm unit and the DME unit.

Don't think that because you don't see rust in your tray that you don't
have any.  The undercoating/seam seal can still allow water underneath
and rust the metal, but still look fine from the top.  We have repaired
holes from pin size on up to craters that the battery could fall
through.

Periodically, the battery can be removed and the tray clean with
bicarbonate and then rinsed to get the acid out.  You can usually tap
around on the tray and find the weak spots. 

The sooner this problem is found, the easier it is to repair.  We have
had to fabricate complete new battery boxes on cars as late as 1988.
