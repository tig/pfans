Well, the time has finally come.  The "new" car is in, and we haven't got
a place for the Porsche any more, so it has to go (one way or another).

I'd prefer to sell the car in one piece, but considering the non-working
state of the transmission, I doubt that's going to happen.  Everything
necessary to make a 924 go is present and, except for the transmission,
working okay.  The engine was just rebuilt about 2K miles ago (that's the
one that gets me).  The body is servicable (no holes), but there is
substantial rust in some areas, particularly the front fenders.  The car
did ship with all the options except fog lights, including power windows,
power mirrors, and front and rear sway bars.  The transmission is the
unique '79 924 type (5-speed manual), so if you want it for parts, you can
have that, too.

Make me offers.  I'd prefer it if people came and got the parts on their
own, but I might be able to make exceptions.

If anyone would be willing to buy the car and get the car driveable
again... well, I'd *really* like that.  I'd love to see this car go to a
good home.
