Amen.  My goal this season is to keep reminding myself that Solo 1 is not
supposed to be a form of aerobic exercise. And that sore shoulders and
cramped legs don't equate to fast lap times.  Last season at Pueblo, which
was a new track for me, my fastest lap time was my fourth lap, when I had
finished scouting out the corners and was pushing a little. 50 or 60 laps
later, after sweating like a pig for 2 days trying to go faster, and
burning up pads and tires, I finally chilled out and matched my time on
that fourth lap.
