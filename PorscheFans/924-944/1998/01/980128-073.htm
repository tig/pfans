Does anyone have an electrical schematic for an 86' 944T that is in a 
format that can be email attached?  I was told the only schematic is 
located in the original workshop manual and I have no access to one 
of these.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  I'm not confident 
the Haynes manual really has the Turbo schematics in it.

<< Did they crack in the bell flange behind (when mounted) the cast collar

 bolts to the head?  And is this what you had welded?  All but the number
three 
 pipe on my car is showing signs of leaking.
 
 Also, it looks possible to remove the headers without removing the engine but
 it going to be close.  How did you get your headers out?

Jay,
The 2/3 manifold was cracked at the flanges and in the center, like a wishbone
begining to split.  The 1/4 manifold was fine.  I don't know when it was
replaced, it's the updated manifold.  I'm concerned over how long it will hold
up because it wasn't done with stainless welding wire.  My fault.  I wrapped
them in header tape, and they look pretty good.  The manifold that was welded
was about 1mm wider, meaning the flanges were farther apart.  Took quite a bit
of prybar and back ache until I got the damn bolts in (I pulled the studs, and
replaced them with bolts.  In order to take the manifolds off with the engine
in is to pull the studs.  Then to replace the manifolds, you'ld have to
install the studs with the manifold on anyway.  

The manifolds came of relatively easily.  I used a floor jack and piece of
plywood to lift the engine a bit (If this is bad for the engine in any way
PLEASE tell me!).  This gave me enough clearance to pull the manifolds.

Good luck,
Bob

<< Is this good or bad?
 
 I guess the answer is that if you use Techron, pour it in the
 tank, and then drive the car until all the gas is gone. >>


Remember that a bottle is supposed to be mixed with a tank of gas.  That's
quite a bit of dilution.
