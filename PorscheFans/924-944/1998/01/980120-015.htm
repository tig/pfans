Something that really gave me an image on what to do when the rear end
comes around is a film a PFans sent me (thanks, David) of a Ruf 911 driving
Nurburgring rather fast.  Most impressive thing was how busy the driver was
with the steering wheel.  Most of the sharper corners were taken with an
extreme 4 wheel drift with the rear really hanging out.  The steering
corrections were constant, mostly countersteering VERY quickly at various
angles to hold the 911 on the line.  It's been likened to walking a
tightrope -- lots of small, quick corrections in balance rather than one
big correction to catch a fall.  The 911 is twitchier than our cars, but I
would imagine the same technique applies.  I've got to find the guts to do
some of this next season -- must be a rush.
