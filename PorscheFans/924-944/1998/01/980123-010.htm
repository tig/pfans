Almost always the difference in horsepower between the US and European cars
has been the results of efforts to meet US emissions standards. However,
you also have to look at the standard by which the horsepower was measured.
Horsepower in the US is measured in SAE net (Society of Automotive
Engineers) horsepower and horsepower in Germany it is measured in DIN
horsepower (don't know what DIN stands for). Anyway, the horsepower for the
first US model 944 was actually 143 SAE net hp @ 5500 rpm. The Euro version
was 163 DIN hp @ 5500 rpm. The US model measured against the DIN standard
was 150 DIN hp @ 5500 rpm. The horsepower difference between the US and
Euro models were a result of using different compression ratios. The
compression ratio for the US model was 9.5:1 while the Euro version had a
compression ratio of 10.6:1. Hope this answers your question.
