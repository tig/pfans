I have a 924 which apparently has the mounting points for rear seatbelts,
but no actual seatbelts (the car was too early to have them fitted as
standard). I have contacted my local Porsche Dealer, who has quoted me
almost ?400 to have them supplied and fitted. On the other hand, I can
obtain second-hand belts for around ?50 the pair.

The question is, does anyone have experience of fitting these belts
themselves? I am concerned that there might be hidden extras involved which
I don't know about (like requiring additional fittings or some adaptation
to the car). If the fitting is a simple screw-on/bolt-on affair, I will
obviously want to save the extra ?350, and fit some myself.

Thanks
     Dave
