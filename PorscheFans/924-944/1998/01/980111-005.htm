Ray,

If the balance shaft belt is properly timed and the motor mounts are indeed
ok, then you have to look to what is going on in the cylinders.    I would guess
that they are not all producing the same power, meaning that you have either
an ignition problem (inconsistent firing), a fuel problem (bad injector spray
pattern or electrical connection to an injector), or an air problem (valve 
wear, piston ring seating).   

My first vote would be for clogged injectors.   When an injector puts out a
poorly atomized spray the fuel mixture either won't light, will burn
inconsistently,
or will burn unevenly.   Such a condition will normally begin to show first at
idle, when even minor injector fouling will interfere with fuel atomization at
the low injection volumes required.   As you come off idle the problem will
go away (at least in the case of minor fouling), because the percentage of
interference becomes smaller and smaller as more and more fuel is demanded.

You might try a couple of cans of injector cleaner and see if it makes any
difference.   I have not had especially good luck with such cleaners, though
they sometimes work.   On a twelve year old car, however, a better answer
is probably to replace the injectors.   They are a moving part and they do
wear.

A secondary possibility is a marginal loss of fuel pressure, where the fuel
pressure is just out of tolerance on the low side, where you simply would 
not get enough fuel to support consistent combustion.   However, I think
you would have other symptoms under full throttle . . . 

Good luck.

Dave
