While taking the amplifier out of my '84 944 I see this hidden relay
high up on the firewall in the driver-side footwell, bolted directly to
the firewall with an egg-shaped, nylon bolt. In my efforts to cut a
zip-tie securing the amplifier, I broke this relay.

This is a double relay, about twice as wide as a normal relay, with two
plugs attached. It has the Porsche pyramid logo and PPN 944.xxx.xxx.00
-- unfortunately the x's are unreadable. The relay also says "12V 55W x
2" which sounds like a headlight relay. The lights on my car are the
factory sealed beams and H3 fog-lamps -- no aftermarket lights. I tried
the lights, brights, fog-lamps, horn, fans, alarm, cruise, wiper/washer,
all with the relay disconnected -- everything appears to work. The only
electrical problem in my car that I am aware of is a sunroof that works
when it wants to -- does this double-relay control the sunroof?

Since the relay has a 944 PPN I assume it does something fairly
functional and is not an accessory relay. In any case my 944 has no
aftermarket accessories. I can't think of a pair of devices in the car
that use 55 watts each. If anybody knows what this relay does and/or has
a PPN please let me know, before I find out the hard way in the middle
of the next road-trip through Idaho -- TIA.
