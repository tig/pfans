Check all of your engine sensors: O2, engine temp, air flow meter, =
throttle switch, and aux air valve, as well as the thermal vacuum switch =
for the fuel pressure regulator. Look at your ignition system as well: =
cap, rotor, wires, etc. My 85 has a similar intermittent problem, where =
it all of a sudden develops a lumpy idle. Unplugging/replugging/cleaning =
the connections clears it up. Also check the flywheel sensors for proper =
ops. If you can run it long enough without tearing up the motor mounts =
under 'lumpy' conditions, do so, then let it cool and pull the plugs. =
This will tell you if the problem is with all cylinders, or one in =
particular.

Subject: Idle Problems

Help, I've run into one that has me about stumped! The idle on my '87 =
944S
has developed a mind of it's own!

When the engine is first started the idle seems ok, a bit lumpy but 800 =
to
1000 rpm. After a bit of driving when I come to a stop the idle speed is
either 1300rpm or it sits at 1600 rpm then s l o w l y drops to 12 / =
1300
or it surges between 1000 to 1600rpm.
If the engine is shut down then restarted it idles ok. Also when driving
everything seems normal, no loss of power, but there has been a slight =
drop
in gas mileage. It seems like the idle speed improves after a bit of a =
run
above 4000 rpm but starts acting up again after adhearing to the posted
speed limits.

I've R&R'ed the air filter and checked for vacuum leaks. ( at least all =
the
vacuum lines I could find )  Par for the course the Haynes only covers =
the
8 valve engine so the diagrams that show vacuum routing are about =
useless!
I did find that there is about 1/4 inch slack ( deflection ) in the
throttle cable and the return spring had hung partially open on an =
overly
long hose clamp at the rear of the engine compartment. The hose clamp =
has
been clipped and the throttle return assembly is free through-out the
entire movement.

93 octane gas is hard to find around here so I've been running 91 octane
and adding a  can of fuel additive every third tank. So, I don't think =
gas
quality is the problem.
Any help would be greatly appreciated!

87 944S - 16 valves and still wouldn't trade for a Turbo (well maybe a =
911
Turbo)
