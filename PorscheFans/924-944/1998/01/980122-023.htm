     Hi PorscheFans,
     
     I do not plan to use my 944T during the winter months - mainly because 
     I broke my "driving" leg and will be in a cast from my toes to my hip 
     for at least 2 more months.
     
     The car has not been driven for the last 5 weeks and I am concerned 
     about what will go bad from lack of use during this period.. The car 
     is garaged.
     
     I spoke to the Service Manager at the Porche Dealer from whom I 
     purchased the car.  He advised khaving someone drive the car at least 
     once per week to prevent the tires from developing a "permanent" flat 
     spot. possible interior engine rust,  gas settlement in the tank, etc. 
     
     Anyone have any experience - godd/bad - leaving their car idle for an 
     extended period.
     
     I thank all of you in advance.
     
     Joel
     '86 944 Turbo (Pristine)
