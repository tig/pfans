 It has been almost 20 years since Conzoomer Reports reviewed
 girlfriends (CR, Aug 1972). Since then, styles have changed, new
 features have been introduced, and the market has changed
 substantially. Clearly, another report was long overdue.

 Identifying Your Needs
 ----------------------
 As with any major purchase, before obtaining a girlfriend you 
 should  ask yourself exactly why you need one. Do you want an
 intellectual companion?  A baby factory? A hiking partner? Or just
 lots of good, old-fashioned sex?  Identifying your needs is the
 first, and  most important, step in selecting a girlfriend. The
 potential girlfriends you see in most showrooms tend to be loaded
 with the  usual flashy accessories -- large breasts, long legs,
 blonde hair,  etc.  However, there is also a wide variety of
 accessories designed to  appeal to fringe markets. For example, some
 models come pre-equipped with pets and/or children; others can run 10
 miles while chanting Sanskrit. You should  make a list of accessories
 desired, tolerated, and disliked.  Note  that some accessories (such
 as children) can be added later, while  others (such as a large
 bosom) must be factory-installed since, like  sunroofs, third-party
 installation afterwards runs a significantly  higher risk of leaking
 through a seal. Interior damage may result  from this desire of a
 sportier look & feel.


 Determine Your Budget
 ---------------------
 The second question, of course, is what sort of girlfriend you can
 afford.  The answer is largely determined by your physical and
 personal characteristics. If you are good-looking and have a
 commanding personality and a good sense of humor, you will have 
 the  resources to obtain a fancy, high-end model. On the other hand,
 if you are ugly, smell bad, and wear polyester clothes, your choices
 are more limited.  Keep your purchasing power in mind when
 considering your  selection.  Although the salesman will tell you
 that a girlfriend can be financed, CR does not recommend this
 practice: due to inflating expectations, the required monetary outlay
 will actually *increase*  with time.  Even so, if you possess the
 ability to negotiate stealthfully you  know how to convince a
 prospective girlfriend to want to buy your  goods. 

 That there is a mark of a great salesman.

 Used vs. New?
 --------------
 A question many girlfriend seekers have to address is whether to get
 a new or used girlfriend. The answer to this question will,  roughly
 speaking, be determined by your age:


 Your age           || Used or New
 ------------------ || ---------------------
 13-18 years        New
 19-30 years        Lightly used
 31-45 years        Extensively used
 45+                New***


 *Only if income exceeds $250,000/year. Otherwise, the answer is
 "Divorced, with kids."

 New girlfriends offer the advantage of having no previous bad
 experiences to project upon you. The disadvantage is that they
 will rarely be old enough to open a checking account.

 Used girlfriends, on the other hand, tend to be steady, reliable
 performers, with the initial problems worked out. CR does advise
 that you use caution when choosing models that have significantly
 higher than average mileage (2.1 SO's/yr).  This may be an indication
 that the girlfriend was a professional.

 CR's Methodology
 -----------------
 For our purposes, girlfriends were evaluated by a dedicated group
 of 10 test engineers, selected to typify the average male population.

 All tests were performed at CR's specially constructed facility,
 which included a bedroom, kitchen, and living room, and at a number
 of bars and taverns surrounding the facility. A series of seven tests
 were run, evaluating each product according to the following
 criteria:

   intelligence, wit, humor, empathy, initiative, looks, fear
   thresholds, mechanical ability and performance.

 Results
 --------
 Girlfriends are categorized by similarity. Within each category,
 variation is not statistically significant.

 Category Comments
 ---------------------------------------------------
 -o- Goddess Class A+ -o- This is the woman of your dreams. She 
     comes equipped with all of the options you want and none of the
     ones you don't. She can argue subtle points of philosophy, give
     you a stiff game of racquetball, understand what you mean even if
     you don't say it, break a bed with enthusiasm, adjust your
     valves, and change your oil (in more ways than one). No mental or
     physical hang-ups, and loves to go 130+ with the windows down.
     The drawback is that this model is made from the exotic metal
     unobtanium (not actually available).

 -o- Goddess class B- -i- This model is similar to the Goddess class 
     A+, but comes in-law with contractual retainers, such as a
     psychotic ex-husband, a spiteful mother, an alcoholic father, and
     a bratty kid/teenager with a bad driving record (that you have to
     buy car insurance for).  Her high fear threshold was genetically
     inherited by her kid loves to go 130+ with the windows down with
     of course 5 of his delinquent friends, a pocket full of doobies,
     a case of awful malt liquor, and a revoked license. This model
     tends to generate gray hairs, and DUI defense attorneys rich.

 -o- Ms. Right -o- The best all-around choice for most girlfriend
     situations. Has most of the characteristics of the Goddess class
     A+ except possibly in the wrong size or hair color. Other than
     that, an excellent long-term investment. Availability is
     extremely limited, like a 944 Turbo, but can occasionally be
     found when you already have a model you've invested "too much" to
     release.  Ms Right models are usually much too intelligent to
     stand idly by while you work out any contractual obligations for
     release of your current model.  Caution:  They're probably
     already wise to the "cord tied to the passenger door release
     handle" trick.

 -o- Babe -o- This is the flashy, fully-loaded variety with all the
     options.  Unfortunately this model lacks cognitive powers and
     empathy. Showy, suitable for a parade, concours events or for
     impressing your friends, but not for your long-term girlfriend
     needs. These also tend to be browsed over and/or handled by other
     buyers wanting to buy or rent even if already off the market.
     Not likely to catch on to the "cord tied to the passenger door
     release handle" trick, even after several high speed encounters.

 -o- Friend -o- The model with the most empathy. Caring and kind 
     but tends to be aesthetically lacking. Availability is poor to
     fair depending on quality.  Yeah, She's the Chevy Nova Turbo of
     girlfriends. Widely available, but useful only in a pinch, if no
     others are available. Tends to be spiteful or unreliable(has her
     own cord tied to the driver's door handle), with a dull finish.
     Third-party installed bosom may be worth risking.
     Until you find her, Happy Hunting!
