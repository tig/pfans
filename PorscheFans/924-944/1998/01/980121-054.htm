Yes, if you are trying to remove and change it from the top.  But if you 
work from below, all you need to do is remove the front right wheel 
(makes it easier to get under the car in that corner) and it is a lot 
easier to see and change.  A big socket the correct size also helps getting 
a grip on the switch to start with.  Remove the coolant by removing the 
bottom hose or opening the drain plug and then go to it.  Shouldn't take 
more than hour including installing coolant and bleeding the air out.

  Hey PorscheFans!
     I just sent my application for membership in  the Porsche Club of
America-Lone Star Region ( Houston, Tx) after attending my first PCA/BMW auto-
x. It was really fun to watch and I picked up some tips, as well as met some
good people. I had "driven the cones" in Saturns and in Crown Vics and
Impallas as part of factory training for sales reps at different times, but
this is a whole different ballgame!
I was unable/unwilling to run my car due to a bad ball joint, but I put my new
A-arm on today and will be ready for next months Auto-X!  Hopefully, I'll have
JeffBCS "s hand-me-down front & rear sway bars from his turbo on my na auto by
then, as well!
  As far as the off and on thread about handling and correcting the breaking
away of the rear-end and /or spinning out, I believe that auto-xing would
benefit most drivers by practicing these moves in a safe environment. You
don't have to beat your car to death at these things either, it is possible to
drive agressively without being brutally hard on your tires and car! Just
figure you could cut a second off your time if you didn't care about your car.
 By the way, there is a great book about handling and technique that  I have
been reading a lot lately. It is titled "SPORTS CAR andCOMPETITION DRIVING" by
PAUL FRERE, Lemans winner, Grand Prix Driver, and Road & Track magazine's
European Editor. Phill Hill recommends it, too!
