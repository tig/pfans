A couple of people have asked for a description of one of my 951s.  I can
comment on any of the aftermarket parts or installation procedures involved,
as I did most of the procuring and installing myself.

1987 944 Turbo, manufactured 10/86.  Original owner (hereafter referred to as
"PO") took delivery Spring 1987 from Carlsen in Palo Alto.  Guards red, black
Porsche cloth seats.  Car was equipped with LSD option (#220), cruise control
and rear wiper option (removed for AX/track season).

Interior appointments:

Recaro SRB seats (found on BB at Automotion, one year old $100 each!!!).  Momo
Monte Carlo 350 mm steering wheel in place of factory airbag wheel.  Autopower
roll bar and halon fire extinguisher.  Five point Sabelt camlock safety
harnesses (only for track and AX).

Blaupunkt CD player and BEA 80 eq/amp (from Turbo S).  Ten speaker system from
Turbo S, plus Nakamichi 8" sub and Alpine 3-way amp for rear speakers and sub
(both easily removed for competitive driving events).

Custom gauge panel with VDO boost (up to 30 psi), water and oil temp gauges.
Mounts in center vent area in a spare vent/instrument cluster bezel.  Removed
for winter, and replaced with stock unit.

Brakes/Hubs:

928 S4/Turbo S front brakes and hubs.  Stock rear brakes.  On the front, gas
slotted rotors for street/AX, and 968 M030 drilled rotors for the track.
Pagid Orange or Performance Friction 90 compound pads for track, Metal Master
or Ferodo pads for street.  Cool Brake duct system with modified backing plate
and hub ducting (forces more air through rotor than normal Cool Brake).
Factory 928 S brake proportioning valve (allows use of more of the rear brakes
than stock valve).  Stainless-steel brake lines mated to factory solid lines
on front calipers, and all the way into rear calipers.  Later-style (larger)
master cylinder.

Suspension:

Front "Cup Car" Koni custom valved, double-adjustable sport shocks with
threaded perches (AX/track season).  These were purchased at a sweap meet for
$20 each!. Stock single-adjustable Turbo S shocks/perches (Winter).  Eibach
450 lb or 325 lb springs (AX/track season) or stock Turbo S units (Winter).
Factory "Cup Car"/968 M030 30 mm front sway bar.  Turbo S control arms.
Kelly-Moss Racing billet adjustable camber plates.  Brey-Kraus strut tower
brace.

Weltmeister rear adjustable sway bar.  Factory 968 M030 rear Koni single-
adjustable sport shocks with 200 lb Carrera helper springs (AX/track season)
or factory Turbo S Konis (Winter).  Turbo S torsion bars.

Drivetrain:

Turbo S tranny (Swepco oil), and later-style CV joints (Redline grease) and
halfshafts.  Sachs HD/"Cup Car" clutch disk.

Engine:

Milledge oil/air separator.  Terbatrol oil cooler in series with factory
cooler.  All oil lines are -12 Aeroquip.  Later-style oil pan with custom
baffling by Milledge.
DME/KLR chips, custom designed by Milledge.  Turbo S turbo charger.  Four
wastegate shims and 3 bar Bosch fuel pressure regulator.  Approx. 1.1 - 1.2
bar of boost.  K&N air filter.  Milledge guesses over 300 bhp, although he
cannot remember exactly which chips these are (they were made and installed in
1988).  All he will say is that the PO (Indy car driver Randy Lewis) wanted to
always go really fast, and could never have enough.  Then he strongly suggests
I use race gas on the track, which I do.  Jon is very conservative, and has
had his own engine dyno for years, and does not make false hp claims.  He is
very sensitive about this.  WIde fire ring head gasket, and Bosch 5-level
plugs.  Redline or Mobil 1 oil.  8mm plug wires.  Prestone Long Life
(phosphate free) coolant with Redline Water Wetter and distilled water (85%).
Optima battery.

Other:

Hella H4 headlights.  Special fiberglass nose panel (track only) exposes
intercooler for increased air density to intake manifold.  Twelve total wheels
as follows:

AX: 7 & 8 x 16 forged disk wheels with BFG Comp TA R1 245/45.
Track: Club Sport forged 8 & 9 x 16 with BFG Comp TA R1 245/45, plus cast
S2/C2 8 x 16 with BFG Comp TA R1 245/45.
Street: 7 & 9 x 16 forged Club Sport (Turbo S), with 225/50 and 245/45 RE71.

Otherwise, the car is absolutely stock.

Next up: factory twin turbo front calipers, and move the Turbo S units to
rear.  12.7 or 13.??? factory rotors of some sort, and 17 inch wheels.
Extrude hone the intake manifiold.  Then lightening (remove insulation,
stereo, AC, heater, cruise, et cetera) further down the road.  And always,
more and more track time.
