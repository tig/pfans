There is definitely a time and place for it and the streets are definitely
not the time or place.  I can say that is the only time I've done something
like that.  Honest!!  If only more drivers would realize that just because
they have a car that will go X miles per hour or handles  a certain way,
doesn't mean they can get out and drive like Mario Andretti.

Well, I finally got the DME/fuel relay problem figured out after following the
circuitry inside the DME box. There were 2 small bottleneck areas of printed
circuit under the big connector which had burned open somehow. I bridged them
with some solder and it hums like new, no clicking intermittent relay. I think
these must have been routes to ground that more than one part of the DME
relied upon, and without them there was too much current building on the
ground side of the connection to keep the transistor doing its thing. There is
a coating of some kind on the board which is flaking off in many places, and I
suspect it protects the circuit form corrosion, when it is in place. Hopefully
I have not just treated a symptom, but if it ever dies at least I know how its
supposed to work so I can get around it. Frenna@aol.com 87 924S
