I'm not proud of it, but I had a similar experience about 6 months ago when
a 240SX thought he could show me a thing or two (when I was driving my M3).
 We both exited the freeway with me in the lead (101 S.  Embarcadero Exit
W)  I took the exit at semi-track-like speeds (80 or so)  the guy in the
240SX figured he could keep up and was wrong.  He ended up going straight
when the road turned (can you say understeer?)  He ended up going over a
VERY tall curb and running into a road sign.  Luckily he didn't fly into
oncoming traffic!

Anyway, I think this proves that a large percentage of people on the road
don't have a clue what they are doing.  Now I will alow people in "lesser"
cars who think they can "beat" me do just that.  I refuse to play their
silly games.  Hmmm, maybe I'm growing up....Well, maybe not.  ;-)
