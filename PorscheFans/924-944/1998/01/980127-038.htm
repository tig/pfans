Some of my experience with the 944's cruise control:

To Dhruv Devichand and John Hansel ---

My 85.5 944 had the same cruise control "mind of its own" problem. I
thought it was amusing that the car insisted on adding 10MPH to my set
speed, no matter where I set it.

I just got used to it. Set at 60 to go 70, set at 70 to go 80, etc...


To Gregor Diseth --

You have a malfunction someplace in your cruise control if the RPMs
climb when you depress the clutch. First thing I'd check is the clutch
switch. Both my '84 and 85.5 944's would disengage the cruise control
the moment I depress the clutch. It would re-engage as soon as I let out
the clutch. In both cars, the cruise completely shuts off when you tap
the brake, and must be reset manually after that. This is normal
operation. It's on page 22 of the '84 owner's manual, and on page 24 of
the 85.5 owner's manual. The only caution (in both manuals) is not to
put the car in Neutral with the cruise control on "to prevent excessive
engine rpm".

85.5 944 - burgandy/black; I was original owner; car is now a memory but
the 139K miles were 100% fun. Except the last 50 feet...
84 - tan/sapphire blue; I'm the 3rd owner; it screams
