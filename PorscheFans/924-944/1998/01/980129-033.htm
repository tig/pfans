Fellow P-fans,
The navel jelly is sitting on the rust spots as I write. I had placed a
battery matt under the battery not more than 2 months ago thinking that after
I took care of the few rust spots that I previously had, all would be well in
battery tray land.  Well, after reading the e-mail on the effectiveness of
battery matts a couple of days ago, I thought I would check out the condition
of  the tray. Well, rust is there again! I have a Sears battery in place now
and I know it is seeping sometimes even though it is supposed to be a
maintenace free battery. 
What about the Optima battery? Is it the answer to the rust problem? Where can
I purchase one?
By the way, since I have put the updated aero mirrors on my car, I would like
to sell the old ones. The drivers mirror motor is no good, but the passenger
side was good the last time I checked. The mirrors are guards red and in
pretty good shape. I am asking $80.00 a piece for them. I'll pay shipping.
