I do not know what you intend to do with the car, but both cars are good 
reliable cars if correctly maintained.  The Turbo costs more to maintain 
because there is more heat and stress to cause problems and particularly 
because they are more difficult to work on.  This translates to more 
labor hours.

If the car is to be used for daily driving without hard driving, then I 
would expect a lower rate of service.  For this type of service I feel 
that the Turbo is a very reliable car.  However, as with any complex 
system, things can go wrong unexpectedly.  When pushed to their limits, 
there are weak links in the Turbo.  Head gaskets are the chief source of 
concern, however, there are a host of little things that can annoy the 
owner.

After owning a 87 944, 87 944S, and a 89 Turbo, my vote goes to the 
Turbo, but all three are fun cars to drive.  The Turbo just has a higher 
fun factor for me.

Also, you have not discussed what your available financial resources are. 
 I would keep $2,000 in the bank for either car for the first year of 
unexpected service if you can.  My Turbo ate up almost $5,000 of cash the 
first year, but almost all of that was planned in advance.

Have your choice of vehicles inspected at a reputable shop.
