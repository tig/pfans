From time to time I've noticed the smell of gasoline in the passenger
compartment after filling up the tank. My habit is to leave the pump
running until the tank pressure (or whatever) causes the pump handle
itself to kickback and turn off. This is a habit I developed with
previous cars in order to track the mileage I'm getting (when my
odometer is working, anyway). I thought the fumes were probably from
the fill-tube vents others have mentioned being blocked.

On a recent high wind-chill day I was adding Techron and fuel in this
fashion. When coming back around the rear of the car, I happened to
notice a puddle under the muffler (left side rear)!! It was in
fact gasoline, and was dripping down next to and onto the muffler
itself. Since then I've geusstimated how much gas I could add without
filling the tank completely and avoided any repeat.

Question: Is this a normal overflow sotuation, or have I got something
to worry about here? Is there supposed to be a tube for this overflow
that would keep gas from hitting a (dangerously?) hot exhaust system?

Any advice appreciated...
