The balance shafts could more accurately be called the unbalanced shafts.

In the Porsche inline 4 cylinder engines, the firing order creates a 
vibration/shock wave that travels through the block.  The balance shafts 
are actually designed to be out of balance by themselves.  But when 
rotating at 4x crank speed they create an opposite and equal 
vibration/shockwave that also travel through the block at precisely the 
same time as the crank vibration.  This effectively cancels the shockwave 
completely.  The balance shafts require 7 hp to spin.  If the car/engine is 
run with the balance shafts out of balance (due to bad timing, etc.) 
considerable damage can occur in a short time to the engine internals due 
to the excessive vibration.

Hope that helps.

Hello:
   The sprockets were never taken off, so this could not be the cause. I
insist that the marks may be wrong. I should remind you that before the
water pump was replaced the engine ran perfectly. I suspect that the
balance shafts were timed with another reference, of course the question
of which one?
    Also, can it be that the shafts themselves are bad, the engine ran
over 6000 km with the bad timing. What actually does the shaft do, where
does it go to, what does it turn? Can it be that it is not fulfilling
its purpose? Thanks.

P.C.
