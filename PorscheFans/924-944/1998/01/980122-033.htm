I think this is a great idea. I'll volunteer right now for doing a video on
"Things to Avoid when Bleeding your Brakes".  I should have filmed my last
session.  Brake cleaner in the eyes (always wear safety glasses, and
remember that as you empty one can of cleaner, the new can will always
spray much more forcefully). Brake fluid in the vacuum pump (be sure to
secure the pump reservoir upright in a can or some other heavy concave
item).  Popped out pistons (remember never to step on the brake pedal once
you've removed the pads), etc.  

I agree with Joe on finances.  A group interested in a subject can bankroll
the volunteer for the necessary supplies (film, blanks cassettes, lighting,
etc. - but not a new camcorder).  All contributors get a free copy.  After
that, charge a fee for the production if one wishes.

BTW, what does it cost to get this listserver going, and who's putting in
the time? This might be a worthy recepient of some of the profits.
