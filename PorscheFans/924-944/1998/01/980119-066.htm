Help!!

        Going for my first driver's ed and a friend lent me a Bleffe helmut
but it is a Snell 85 and I just find out it needs to be a 90 or 95. Any
suggestions about a good helmut to buy that wont break the bank? What do I
want in fit and does anyone have a used one they want to unload?

I'm really sorry to hear about your accident.  I won't pretend to know the
answers, but a few observations may help.  In my experience of autocrossing my
944, I found that it would on occasion set up a "wagging" motion like a
pendulum that was virtually unrecoverable (by me, anyway).  This usually
hapened when I got "lost" on the track and tried at the last second to make
the next gate.  Unlike my 911, which would just spin, the 944 would actually
do a weird pendulum routine like you described.  Sounds like the combination
of rain, different wear rates (and ages) of your tires, and bad karma may have
put you in the same fix.  Don't beat yourself up.  At least nobody got hurt.
If you want a long collection of stupid car tricks, stupid airplane tricks,
and other near death experiences, e-mail me directly.  

What you SHOULD do, however, is go to those driver's eds, and especially
autocrosses.  My wife and I both began doing track and autocross a few years
ago, and last winter, she credited her autocross experience with preventing a
nasty accident on the highway when her Honda began to hydroplane.  She did
exactly the right thing without even thinking about it.  I think that nothing
beats autocross for learning the limits of car control in a safe environment.
Track driving then further hones those skills in a less safe, but in many ways
less demanding, environment.

Your car will be fixed, and you'll be a better driver for the experience.

Jeff:

Sounds like a bad voltage regulator that is causing the car to run on the
battery (instead of the alternator) until it runs down enough to cause the
computer to have a low voltage induced nervous breakdown.  After sitting
overnight in a heated garage, the battery has enough energy to get up and do
it all again.  Try checking out the complete charging system.
