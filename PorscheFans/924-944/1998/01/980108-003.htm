Hello Wes,

> How do these compare with BFG R1' on a road course for less than 30 minute

I had a set of the RS II that I used last year. For track sessions they
were fine. Maybe a little slower than the R1, but very little, if at all.
They handled fine, and I liked them a lot.

The RS II was designed for A/X. I did use them on the track, but it
was early in the season, and not too hot. I did use the rears in
August (wore out the fronts and replaced them with the RS), and they 
still worked well. I would not worry about them on the track.
