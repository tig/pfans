Did you see the 8 second Tercel @ 150 mph in Turbo magazine? :)

So true--an acquaintance in Austin has melted pistons in his FWD DSM trying
to match my 14.7 psi 944T on the top end.

Clark Fletcher Writes in an earlier post:

>>As Chris pointed out, the sleeves we discussed are actually aluminum
liners for the aluminum cylinders. If a block has to be bored, there are
several options. A steel/cast iron sleeve can be installed, the cylinder
walls can be resiliconized, or the aluminum liner can be replaced. <<

The 944 block as produced by Porsche is liner-less.  The cylinders and block
are cast in one operation, utilizing a special high silicon aluminum alloy.
After boring, the cylinders are honed in a manner that removes only the
aluminum, leaving the Silica crystals as the actual cylinder surface (as Clark
said in his post). 

This process yields cylinders with a very hard wear surface, better sealing,
and excellent heat transfer characteristics. The same process has been used by
Mercedes Benz for over 15yrs with excellent reliability / longevity.  Porsche
had reduced production costs  (if you don't count the ruined blocks due to
casting porosity) while improving cylinder longevity.  

The installation of cast or ductile iron sleeves is a move backwards in some
respects.  It should be viewed as a last resort to salvage otherwise junk
blocks or to facilitate the use of non-plated aluminum pistons in the 944
block.

P.S. Does anyone know when the list is going to go back to readable text?
