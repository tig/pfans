I just saw the posts on the impala....

these cars are in my opinion one of the nicest four-doors on the road. they
have either the LT1 vette engine or a few have a ZR-1 vette engine, so they
have quite a bit of power, but I think thety only come automatic and their
0-60 is in the low 6's. I have seen one though with a vortech supercharger
and NOS in addition to the ZR-1 engine.

just my .02

 924 Fuel Problems=0A=0AHi, folks=0A=0AI'm about at the end of my string.=
  I've got an 82 924 that seen the inside of=0Aa repair shop more than I'=
ve been able to drive it.  Here's my litany of=0Aproblems; maybe someone =
can help.  Problem(s) first started when the car=0Asimply=0Awouldn't star=
t. I had found frayed wires going to the aux air valve and thrmal=0Atime =
switch; fabricated a new harness and the problem seemed to disappear for=
=0Aa=0Awhile.  The mechanic found the boot going to the auxillary air val=
ve was held=0Atogether with electrical tape and the other boot going to t=
he air filter was=0Ahalf off.  The sensor plate height was adjusted and w=
hen car started blew a=0Aton=0Aof black smoke.  Seems the PO relied heavi=
ly on Pep Boys parts and two spark=0Aplug wires (just a year old) were ba=
d. Replaced those and the car actually ran=0Abetter than it had since I a=
cquired it.  One morning I go to fire it up and it=0Awon't start again! B=
y this time the towing company brings me coffee and=0Adoughnuts when they=
 come to pick up the car.  This time the problem is fairly=0Aapparent (ev=
en to me).  The line from the gas tank to the fuel pump has worn=0Athroug=
h.  Also, it seems this model has a fuel pump in the tank (Haynes manual=
=0Adoesn't show this)that was leaking right around where the ground lug a=
ttaches.=0AThese get replaced; the car starts right up and feels pretty g=
ood.  Drive back=0Ato work BUT when I'm getting ready to leave I can't st=
art the car.  Wait a=0Acouple of minutes and with considerable tromping o=
n the gas manage to get it=0Astarted but it stumbles and takes a little b=
it for the idle to smooth out.=0AGet=0Aup this morning( about 40 degrees)=
, crank it up and it starts right up with=0Athe=0Aidle at a rock solid 90=
0rpm. Get to work, let the car sit for about an hour=0Aand=0Anow I can't =
start it. What is going on?  One thing to note is once the car=0Astarts u=
p there has never been a problem with stalling or crummy idle even=0Awhen=
=0Athe car had all those air leaks and it pulls well all the way to 6,000=
rpm.=0AThis=0Acar also has a new head gasket and head rework.  I'm runnin=
g out of my car=0Aallowance money so any help you guys can provide will b=
e great.=0A=0AThanks in advance=0A=0ARon=0A=0A=0A=0A=0AHello P-Fans & Ron=
=0A=09So I imagine you fixed all of the vacuum leaks (the ones =0Arepaire=
d with electrical tape) fixed, right? If so proceed. =0ADid all of start =
up after the headgasket work? Sometimes the=0A ECU grond wires don=92t ge=
t reattached or the electrical =0Aconnector break off & away form the wir=
e. The ground wires=0A usually go the cylinder head, on the small side of=
 the head=0A by the coolant spicket (not real sure on a 924, just going =
=0Aby my experience with CIS VW engines). You could just run a =0Ajumper =
wire (as a test from the Neg battery post to the =0Acylinder head) 18-16 =
gauge wire w/aligator clips is fine =0Afor testing. =0A=09Since you had  =
replaced the fuel pump, did you also =0Areplace the fuel pump fuse and re=
lay? If not do so, a worn =0Aout fuel pump draws moore currant and will c=
ause these items=0A to wear out. On all older cars that use the ceramic t=
ype =0Afuses I would replace the fuse every few years, and gently=0A bend=
 the tabs in so that the fuse is not loose. A loose =0Afuse can burn up t=
he fuse box in no time. It causes more =0Aamps to draw thru the circuit. =
=0A=09I would also check fuel pressure after the engine has =0Abeen start=
ed and turned off for a hour or so. There is a =0Acheck valve built in th=
e fuel system, its job is to hold=0A the fuel in all the fuel lines, up t=
o the injectors and=0A all. If this valve fails, fuel bleeds away from th=
e =0Ainjectors and a cold start problem will exist. On CIS cars=0A the ch=
eck valve is sometimes built into the fuel pump,=0A or the acumulator, or=
 seperate some where near the fuel=0A pump.  You could also have a leakin=
g injector causing =0Athe pressure to bleed down. =0A=0A=09=09=09=09Good =

Hello P-Fans
	How hot did the engine get? Sometimes when a engine overheats
 or runs alittle hoter than normal for a time, it can damage the coolant
thermostat, and coolant temp seders (like temp gauge or DME engine temp
switch).

Hello P-Fans
	I just replaced my steering rack last month, the right side had a worn
bearing. What I thought was a worn tie rod became a little more involved!
Anyway, my old rack also made had a simular grinding noise. It also rattled
for a second or so, when entering driveway seams, where the pavement meets the
concrete with a little speed - 5 mph. BTW.  My old rack had no leaks.
	If you have a leaking rack, and you continue to drive with it, eventually you
will wear it out! I would think that effort to steer the car would become
quite high!

  			Good Luck, Davidjalai@aol.com

Subject: steering rack

Hi P-fans,

I'm unsure if my steering rack has a problem.  No leaks as the resevoir
fluid level remain the same.  But there is a faint grinding feeling in the
collum that can be felt through the steering wheel at low speed driving
(parking lots). 

1) Is there another problem?
2) If I do develop a leak, and the s-rack is damaged, is it necessary to
fix it right away?  I mean, if all the fluid leaks out of the steering rack
and it grinds to hell, don't I simply loose power-steering?  And If the
s-rack has to be replaced or rebuilt anyway, is there a rush to do so?

Thanks!
