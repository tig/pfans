<<     I have an '86 944T with the same problem.  The option code shows
forged
wheels, and I suspect the sticker would too, but the original owner who
I know and trust says the car came with phone dials.  Maybe we should
contact
Porsche NA and ask the whether they were selling cars in 86 with this
option
but not actually putting on the Fuchs wheels.
     Other list members please respond.

**********************

I own a 1986 944t.  Bought 2 ys ago-it had 31k miles.
I've got all service records, including original window sticker.  I've
looked  the sticker over lots of times.  It lists all standard
equipment, and factory add-on equipment.  Standard equip. includes the
7x16 and 8x16 pressure cast wheels.  Over on the factory add-on equip.
side where additions like the LSD, Sport Shocks, etc, and their factory
add-on price is listed, is this:
"16-inch Forged Alloy Wheels, $491.00".
I assume these are the optional Fuchs wheels.  My car has the phone
dials.  Now, I am not complaining (too much)-I like the phone dials.
However, is it correct that the factory Fuchs are the "better" wheel,
stronger, better for track, etc., than the phone dials?  If nothing
else, is it correct that they are more "valuable" than phone dials?
Does it sound like my PO (I'm the3rd owner) did a switch-a-roo on me?
Is the "Forged Alloy Wheels" the Fuchs style? Is there such a thing as a
forged phone dial wheel?  For all but the most demanding application,
does the wheel type (phone dial or Fuchs) make a big difference?
Thanks in advance for all your help.

Someone at the dealership swapped wheels. It happened all the time when
911s and 944s came with the wheels that were interchangable. Most
first-time Porsche buyers din't realize the Fuchs wheels were
considerably more expensive than the cast wheels (phone dials or cookie
cutters). So you dicker with the dealer and he decides to switch the
wheels to give you a 'discount'. The other variation is the customer who
came before you and wanted a car with this option that didn't come with
it. The 944s that came with the Fuchs 7s and 8s were particularly
popular with the 911 crowd. I'm sure if you traced it back to the dealer
that he would state this discrepancy was mentioned.

There is a world of difference between forged wheels and cast wheels.
Forged wheels are considerably stronger and lighter. Cast wheels are
considerably cheaper. Also, beware that there are aftermarket cast
wheels that look identical to Fuchs. They are junk. Look in the
Automotion catalog for an example.
