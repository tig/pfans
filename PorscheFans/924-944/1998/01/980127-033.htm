I had asked on Saturday about the work "Lemon" on an official Florida 
state document for the car I would like to buy (I guess it scared 
me).

I got several replies, my thanks to their senders.

After talking to a very helpful Michelle at the Florida DMV, I think I 
have the official answer, for anybody ever running across this same 
thing:

The "Lemon $2*" imprint indicates that as part of the cost of 
registering a new car in FL, everybody has to pay this $2 fee so the 
state can pay for the cost of developing and printing brochures 
explaining their Lemon law. These brochures come with every new car 
sold in FL.
It does not mean that the car itself is a lemon, or even an alledged 
lemon. The DMV doesn't neccessarily know if a car turns into a lemon. 
But if the *manufacturer* buys it back from the customer, then their 
computers would show it (and they didn't for the specific car in 
question).
