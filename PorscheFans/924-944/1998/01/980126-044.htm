Howdy,

I've been busy working on the kart lately, it's finally starting to look
like MY kart instead of just a regular kart :)

Might even get a chance to fire it up this week at a new local track.  
Autocrossing in B.C. is going to be a whole lot more fun with a new
track that is much larger than our current largest track.  Can you
say FULL BOOST!!!

This new track is also going to be used for karting and should be a blast!

Anyhow, my question, what can be done to prevent contact corrosion?  I
would like to ensure that my air flow meter and TPS, etc. do not act up
again for a LONG time.  I've cleaned the contacts with a good contact
cleaner, but I want to stick something in there to stop it from corroding
again.  I've heard of dialectric grease, but someone mentioned vaseline,
something that I have at home (hey!  Get your mind out of the gutter!)

What does the general consensus say about contact corrosion prevention?
1. Clean with good contact cleaner and let it be.
2. Clean and use dialectric grease.
3. Clean and use Vaseline.
4. Any other suggestions?

Farzaan.
