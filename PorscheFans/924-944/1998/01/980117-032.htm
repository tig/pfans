My  '89 S2 went into failure mode tonight ... My wife and I went out for our usual 
Sat. night dinner with friends. After dinner the car started up as usual, and ran 
normal for about a block----- then nothing.. The engine just QUIT. No big bang, 
mechanical clatter, ect. I was at low RPM coming to a stoplight, so there was little 
or no stress on the engine. I coasted over to the curb, and cautiously tried the 
starter. The starter spun the engine, but NO compression!!! It didn't make any 
mechanical noises either, and after I heard the starter whining away with no thought 
of firing, I made no more attempts... Is there such a thing as a SMALL timing belt 
slip ????  Luckily some friends were behind us (english and italian car fanatics !!) 
who helped me push it into a well lighted parking lot.

Thr car now has 76,000mi on it, and I had all belts, tensioners, pullys, ect 
replaced at 74,500, and it was going in next Fri. to have them retensioned. The car 
had been driving Great with no problems.. The belts had been quite, and I had not 
noticed any audible engine changes in the last 1500mi ..The temp here has been 
rather unseasonally warm ( 30-45 deg ) during the day, but tonight we are starting 
to cool off, and the temp on the bank was 26 deg.. The car spends it's nights in 
it's semi-heated garage.  Don't know if the recent temp drop and the need for the 
retensioning were a factor !!

Hopefully someone can come up with another reason for this SUDDEN failure. I have 
all day tomorrow to think about it before I get it to the shop. The car was really 
running great too.  Oh well, at least my old faithful 911 gets to get out from under 
it's cover and get a place in the garage !!! It ain't purdy-- but it runs !!!

If any one has any suggestions, I open to any help.  Please leave out any gory 
details. Thanks....
