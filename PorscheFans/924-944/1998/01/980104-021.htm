Just the 944S and 944S2 cars, as far as I know...

Good Luck!

Subject: 951 boost readings 19 psi!

Hello P-Fans
	Well, I hooked up a VDO boost gauge to my '86 951.  I think
 the list will be surprised on the readings. 

	I have a '86 951 that is "stock" except for the following:
	APE Stage II chips: Version 2.7
	(note: I did not drill out the jet, inside of the bajo bolt)

	a cat bypass tube.

	I use a 30 psi VDO gauge and plumbed it into the "T" 
fitting off the fuel dampner, which inturn get its supply of 
vacuum/boost right of the bajo bolt on the intake manifold, 
by the oil filler/cycling valve area. 

	I took my reading with help from a "freind" who read the 
boost gauge. It was cold out aprox 38' F when I did these 
runs. My readings were as follows:

			1st gear = 10 psi
			2nd gear = 14 psi
			3rd gear =  14 psi
			4th gear =  19 psi
			5 th gear = 19 psi

	My car has almost 170K on it and has the orginal 
headgasket as far as I know. I also use 94 octane 
Sunnoco gas, which the engine seems to run better on. 
I usually do not run WOT for more than 15 sec's at a
time. My engine has no detonation at all! 

	I would be interested to know what the "List" 
thinks about the pressure results. 

	Thanks, DavidJalai@aol.com
