I had the same problem over the summer.  The passenger door was very hard
to open and finally one day it broke.  There is a ear on the inside of the
door handle assembly that holds a pivot piece by a roll pin.  That ear
snapped.  This piece can not be fixed.  You'll have to replace the entire
door handle.  I got mine at the dealer and thought it would be $80-$100 but
it was only $50.  You'll have to remove the door panel leaving the window
up to replace it.

There is one bolt to remove once you pop off the two linkage pieces.  Then
you have to gently cock the door handle, slide it forward and pull it out.
The whole project only took about 30 minutes.  The hardest part is
reattaching the lock linkage over the ball joint.  I swore many times but
then again I don't have much patients.  But if you take your time it
shouldn't be that bad.

Good luck!
