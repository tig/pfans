Well, my mechanic just remembered to tell me that Porsche changed the
design. I discovered that the only thing that seems to be bad in my system
is the small loop that goes around the cable on the driver-side lifting
rod-thing (love that precise terminology)is broken off. Anyway, I'm going to
go to some salvage yards and plan to scavange it off another car. The whole
system though magically began to work once I re-assembled it, so I think
maybe the metal gear inside had just gotten knocked out of place or
something. It just won't lift because the driver side rod isn't connected.
So I have removed the whole system for the time being.

Thanks for all the replies, and someone said that the older style mechanisms
were very difficult to re-assemble, but I did it twice and they seem
relatively easy as long as you do it carefully.
