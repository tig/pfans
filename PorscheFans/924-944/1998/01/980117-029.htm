when i forst got to college people looked at me like that all the 
time...it doesnt help that i go to a fairly affluent school where 
even i have said "did your daddy buy that for you"....however instead 
of being pissed about it i explained that i bought the car with my 
hard earned money and that with what they paid for their honda civic 
they could have a much nicer car that was a whole lot faster and 
picked up more girls...after about the 5th explain i really got fond 
of their reactions..to make a long story short, last year there were 
3 porsches on campus one was sold, one was a 914 and he graduated, 
and one was mine...this year there are at least 15, so i guess it 
worked...i have even seen a few girls WORKING on them, i think it is 
great and if this girlfriend (v3.0) doesnt work then there is a great 
looking blonde sorority girl with an 88 951.....

I have always heard that a car with many miles on it should run a heavier
weight oil.  I suppose this is true if blow-by is occurring in the older
engines.  Can there be any other explanation for using a heavier weight oil in
an older engine?   My '87 944S has used Castrol 5w30 for most of its 163,000
mile life and has its filter and oil changed every 3,000 miles. The car is a
daily driver and never tracked or autocrossed.  It uses no oil between changes
at all.  I feel the 5w is easier starting in the winter and gets to the valve
train much quicker than a heavier oil would.  The 30w is also sufficient in
the heat of the summer to protect the engine IMHO.  Could I be missing
something?
