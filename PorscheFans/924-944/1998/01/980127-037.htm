My first comment is for the guy that had to replace a fuel line on his
944.  Why couldn't you just use a universal line?  I'll guarantee you
your car won't know the difference, if the thing fits.  A short story:
about a year and a half ago, I got fed up with replacing the power
steering fluid because of a small seep in the power steering line from
the resevoir to the rack, so I went to the vultures at the local
dealer.  They wanted 79.95 for the line, and told me it was different
diameters at either end.  I went to a place in Nashville, Tn that just
sold automotive hoses.  They told me you can replace just about
everything hose wise with a universal hose.  They sold me a Goodyear
brand hose that one fit but the other end was larger than the fitting. 
This particular hose contracts evenly as you tighten the hose.  It
worked like a champ and cost all of $6.  Go to hose shop and see what
they have

The other is for the guy with the Cruise control going to redline when
you depress the clutch.  My 1985/1 does not do that.  When you depress
the clutch the cruise disengages until you let the clutch out.  However
my 1984 944 does not I almost blew the engine when I pushed the clutch
in.  My guess is that there is something wrong with some of the cruise
controls, and they are suppose to disengage.  But it is still good
advise  to not push the clutch pedal in.  Also my 84 sometimes hesitates
when the cruise is engaged.  I have never had it hesitate when I am
driving with the gas pedal, but I guess it could be a coincidence.
