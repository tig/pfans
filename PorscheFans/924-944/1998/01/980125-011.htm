Some time ago I got some seriously helpful hints from P-fans - help (that in
combination with a little prodding from PCGB), saved me a lot of dosh and got
me back on the road.

Now I have a different type of problem and wondered whether anyone had any thoughts.

My slightly-tatty '84 924 often sits overnight in a small private parking lot
in central Cambridge UK. The parking space is in front of one of the Cambridge
Colleges and is open to the street, accessible by pedestrians and cyclists.
Trouble is, that when said pedestrians and cyclists are mixed with strong
drink some of them react badly to P-cars. Even stationary P-cars.  This has
resulted in a number of minor cycle dings - and most recently a demonstration
of kick-boxing on my passenger door (producing a dent, a paint crack and much sorrow).

Any suggestions as to how to discourage this activity? The parking lot is
monitored by video, but not in infra-red, so late night shenanigans are not
adequately recorded.  Plus the guys paid to supervise this area are quite
reluctant to mix themselves with intoxicated teenagers.(Note we are not
dealing with wild gun-toting inner city crack-heads or the like but the
wayward youth of a small University town)

Since the pond-scum seem to favour my car (- and not the other sporty cars -
e.g. Saab & Honda coupe's or Golf GTi that usually sit on the same lot) I
suspect P-phobia is a factor. Should I spray on mud?  Leave the dents in situ
for a while?  Or (as advised by some) trade up to a hot hatch? (I think I'd
sleep in the car first).


Thanks collective for your help and suggestions!
