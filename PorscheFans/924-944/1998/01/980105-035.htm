One of the trick I use for jackstands are a set of 6x6 post cut-offs

*	They pack nice
*	They are bio-degradable
*	They can be double stacked and laid under the wheels 
*	They can be made in custom sizes
*	If you get cold they can be used as heat generators
*	And if you have no more room left they are cheap to replace
(just find someone building a deck!)

BTW: their smaller brothers, the 2x4 cutoff makes a great biodegradable
parking brake. Far more reliable than the 944 type

	Just remember...don't rely on jacks, even hydaulic ones, while
doing
	ANY work on/underneath the car. Use jack stands. And then keep
the jack
	in place with just a little tension on it as a back up. Watch
your
	fingers in case something slips. Once one of my jackstands
slipped a
	notch, luckily I was not under it at the time. So I'm still not
100%
	comfortable with the above setup especially if I have the
jackstand
	heigher than base height.

	In order to get my hydraulic jack underneath the front frame
rail I
	back up onto ramps then lift each front side and place a
jackstand
	under the frame rail. The hydraulic jack fits under the rear
frame rail
	to lift the rear when I need to remove rear tires.

	For the person needing to jack at the track I would lift the
rear first
	with a hydraulic jack, put a jackstand under, remove jack, lift
front,
	place a second jackstand under, then remove/change tires. Remove
	jackstands and repeat for other side. Takes only a few minutes
per
	side.

	Hope this helps,
	Joe    eyecare1@datastar.net
