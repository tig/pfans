Thanks for the great post!  I went down to see the machine yesterday,
there's something so helpless about seeing your car dangling from the 
wallet eating lift from hell.  Since I don't have time to do my own 
repairs nor own the proper tools (more likely the reason), I prefer to see
the problems with my own eyes or feel them with my own hand before I
lay down the cash.

The CV joints were bad.  Two races (I believe they are called) were
gouged quite deeply.  There were some high spots that were shiny, but
the gouges are interesting.  You could flip them the other way around
(as many do) and double their life since they are only damaged on one
side.  What would normally cause a joint to gouge?  I was thinking that
the PO let the car sit forever, perhaps the grease leaked out or maybe
it settled and when he ran the car again, it was running dry for a period
of time, or maybe some foreign object entered the boot and got caught
between the parts?

The control arms, I'm not convinced the ball joints are worn at all.
The service manager tried to show me how it moves around, etc.  After
a few attempts, he was not able to show me any movement from the ball
joint.  My impression from him is that he doesn't want to see me
stranded somewhere on a track with a zillion HP coming at me from
all directions and is being overly cautious, which isn't bad, really.

If the warranty company pays for the repair, sure, if not, he even
said to leave it for now (?)

The hose I didn't check since it seems pretty common and might as well
replace it before it does other damage to my garage floor.

To make matters more fun, my garage door exploded at home with thousands
of pieces of chain shrapnel (sp?) flying at walls and my head.  Good
thing the car wasn't half way in the house when the door decided to 
come down by itself!  Good thing this didn't happen two days earlier
when I had the car half-out and half-in bleeding the cooling system
to get the nose as high as I could get it.  Word of warning, don't
work under a garage door :)  Cost for a new chain was C$75 including
labour, not so bad.

Bill Buetow has decided to come to our WA/B.C. get-together to race.
If you've never seen him run, you are in for a treat!  I promise that
I will not hound him for rides so that others can get a chance :)
