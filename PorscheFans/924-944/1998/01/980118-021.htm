Hallo!
I am a new member of this list serve and have just purchased a '84 944. 
My brother had a '86 944 turbo which he let me drive once. I knew then 
that I must have one of these cars! While the car I purchased doesn't 
have the power the turbo has, it is extremely wonderful to drive! It has 
enough power for me! 

However, there are a few problems with the car:

At around 60mph the steering wheel starts oscillating (violently) back 
and forth! There is also a vibration in the front end as well when this 
occurs. The car has 82K miles on it and was maintained very well....I 
have all the records from the 2 previous owners . Nothing has been done 
to the front end in all those miles.

The power steering pump reservoir is leaking around the hose connection. 
However, the power steering fluid level is okay for now.

Are there any Porsche manuals available for this car?

Can anyone help with me with these problems?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
John
