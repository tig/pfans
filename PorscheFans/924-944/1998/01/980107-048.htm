I'll add the following so you won't be stranded/embarrased on the road.  
It happened to me.  After you have washed the engine, start it up and run 
it for about 15 minutes at idle to completely dry everything in the 
compartment.  With the engine off, use a towel to dry remaining puddles.

No matter how careful you are, water from the washing will collect in the
timing belt area, and with the nice hot engine, steam will form and
condense into water in the top most cool part of the engine, the distributor
cap.  With moisture there, the engine will either run horribly, or appear 
to idle fine, but when you step on the gas, it will buck and die, usually 
in the middle of a busy intersection - happened to me. 

After your engine has been hot for 15 minutes, remove the distributor cap 
and wipe out the moisture with a clean rag, and let things dry for a 
while with the cap off.

As a side note, the distributor cap interior can become damp if you drive 
through fairly deep water and your car does not have the engine undertray 
installed.  This happened to me too

 Hi Pfans, and Happty New Year! What is a good cheap way/ source  for
replacing the cat. converter on my 1985.5 na 944?  Factoty wants $800-900.
Automotion wants $400. Are there any generic or other manufactors ' units that
will work without  reducing flow?
Next question: What is the bulb number for the parking/running lights in my
bumpers? I removeved the burned bulb but it is illegible. This is the high/low
(flash to pass)bulb activated by the turn indicator
 TIA
