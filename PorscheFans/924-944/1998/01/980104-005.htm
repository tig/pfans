Chas,

You need the flywheel lock from Porsche (Tool # 9206, part # 
000-721-920-60 list $23.48).  I have heard of putting the car in gear 
with the brakes on, but the flywheel lock works much better.  You need to 
remove the starter (disconnect battery) and bolt it in place once you 
have the engine at TDC.  You will need to go to the hardware store and 
get a new bolt to hold the flywheel lock on to the bell housing.  You can 
still use the Allen head bolt for the other side.

>Also what to remove to get to the bolts to remove the auto tensioner,
>and any other helpful advice on this procedure would be greatly
>appriciated.

First, loosen the two bolts that set the tensioner position.  One is a 
pivot, the other is the one that has the slot.  Use Porsche tool # 9200 
(part # 000-721-920-00 list $50.52) to detension the tensioner fully 
(rotate tool anticlockwise).  Tighten the two bolts to hold the tensioner 
in the new position.  There are three nuts, not all well seen, that hold 
the tensioner assembly to the front of the engine.  They are slightly 
recessed.  Remove those nuts and the tensioner unit can be withdrawn.

Watch yourself when you reassemble the crank pulley.  It is easy to get 
the alternator pulley misaligned and damage it when you torque the dog 
bolt.  It must be seated flat.  Check with a small mirror to sure.

Remember, the tensioner does not guarantee that your belt will be 
correctly tensioned when you reassemble.  You must use the Porsche belt 
tension gauge and its calibration bar to correctly set the belt tensions 
(part # 000-721-920-10 and 000-721-920-12 list $461.55 and $28.89).
