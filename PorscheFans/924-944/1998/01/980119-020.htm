Look in the yellow pages for an automotive electrical repair shop or a motor
repair shop. They can cheaply (~$25) replace the bearings in your alternator.

Hello P-Fans

Snap-On sells a hand pump pressure bleeder. The same unit is also sold by MAC
Tools & Matco tools.  It cost around $160 for the pump + $20 for the Audi/VW
resivior cap adaptor. Just call their 800 number to order one. 

Another neat way to go would be to replace the brake caliper bleed screws with
one-way valves. I first saw these valves in Circle Track Magazine. Groits
Garage also sell these bleed screws. The new bleed screws have a one-way valve
which will not let air into the hydralic system, but lets fluid out of the
system. You just replace the bleed screws, cock the screw open at all four
corners, then pump the brake pedal. WaaLaa, your braking system in now bled. I
think this method would be easier & faster for one person to perform. I think
a set of bleed screws sells for $45

	Good Luck, DavidJalai@aol.com

Hello P-Fans=0A=09A small amount of oil in the intake system is normal. D=
on=92t worry about. The=0Aoil gets in there from blow by and from the cra=

e valve cover (a conection from=0Athe oil filler area) and travel via a t=
ube/hose over to one of the intake=0Atubes.=0A=09 Of course you could alw=
