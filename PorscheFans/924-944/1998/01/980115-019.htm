The new style valve, #993.110.337.50 is a Bosch part, #0 280 142 108. 
None of my suppliers at this time carry that part, so through my local
Porsche dealer, the list was $33.33, and my cost of $24.33.  

Speaking of the Cut-Off valve (we always called them pop-off valves), I
remember the Kreepy Krauly March-Porsche and the Red Lobster
March-Porsche from my IMSA racing days (mid 80's).  When those cars
would red-line and then shift gears, the pop-off valve would open and
make a shrieking noise and sound like screeching rubber.  If you did'nt
know better, it sounded like that the cars were scratching their tires. 
So, as they went down the straightaways at a gazillion miles per hour
and shifted gears, it sounded like they were spinning their tires at
each shift.  You could be in the pits at Daytona or Riverside and tell
exactly where on the track those cars were by the noise they made. 
Speaking of that, I remember the debut of the 962 by privateer race
teams.  Bruce Leven's Bayside Disposal 962 race team would haul our 924
Carrera GTR to the races and we would pit with them.  At Riverside in
1984, with Al Holbert, I remember the great duel he had with the Kreepy
Krauley March-Porsche driven by Sarel Van DeMewe (sp.?).  What a race
(962 was second).
