Update on my problem:  I replaced the plug wires and distributor
cap, with no effect.  Swapping the plugs had no effect.  After
the engine started acting up, I put the DME box in the freezer
and re-installed it, again with no effect.

I suspect that the problem might be the speed sensor, because I
think the DME box has to "count teeth" in order to determine when
to fire cylinders #2 and #3, whereas the DME could conceivably use
the reference mark sensor to fire the other two cylinders.  The
bellhousing/flywheel expands with the engine heat, changes the
clearance between a possibly weak sensor and flywheel, thus
causing intermittent or low sensor voltage.  Does this sound
reasonable?

Any idea on how to test the speed sensor without using a scope that
the FSM recommends, which I don't have?  I unplugged the sensor and
the engine wouldn't start, so that isn't an option.  I already cleaned
the connection at the top of the engine.
