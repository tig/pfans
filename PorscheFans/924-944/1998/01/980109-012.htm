Yes sir I have seen this problem, your guys are close it is a driver
(Injector) problem. The Brain box can only "drive" a limited amount of
current to the injectors, as resistance builds up in the wiring the
voltage drop is not enough to activate the injectors. When you remove
the load of one the voltage rise is just enough to do the job.

Most likely causes are:
1.	Injector ground (earthling)
2.	Corrosion in injector wires
3.	Corrosion in connector on firewall where injector leads come
through.
4.	And lastly but most likely, corrosion on edge connector of brain
(water drips from battery try onto brain)

Good luck

	Subject: Weird problem ?

	Hello all,

	I'm new to this group and I would like to take the opportunity
to ask to
	all of you porschists if you ever
	heard about my problem;

	I own a 1988  944 wich has the problem that when I leave it in
the
	garage for more then 3 or 4 days in a row
	it won't start on all 4 cilinders.
	What I do at that time is; take of one connector from the
Injectors and
	after about 5 seconds I put it back on
	and the fourth cilinder runs again.

	When I leave the car for say 2 days I can start it as usual !
	I have checked all the wiring that leads to the injectors and
checked
	the sparkplugs, ignition cables, rotor and cap.
	My Porsche garage thought it might be an earthing problem so
they
	checked all earth cabling but it didn't help any.

	Has anybody heard about this problem before on a 944?

	Any help or suggestions are welcome !!!

	Hello Manfred & P-Fans
		The problem you drscribe is a bad fuel pressure
regulator! 
	The regulator is sticking causing the fuel pressure to go sky
high 
	(the fuel reg is on the return side of the fuel rail, back of
the rail 
	by the battery), I forget why pulling off one electrical
connector 
	to a  injector fixes the problem but it does. REPLACE THAT
	 FUEL REGULATOR! Before it leaks fuel all over the engine! 
	 Don't even mess with those 3 Bar (stock is 2.5 Bar)  or higher 
	regulators - you will not get more power just less throttle
	 response and fuel mileage! 

		Fuel pressure regulator part #944-110-198-03, $70.
		
						
					Good Luck, Davidjalai@aol.com
