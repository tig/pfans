Hello Fellow Waterpumpers:

Last Saturday when I was driving my 1988 924S, it cut out altogether three
times, for about 2-4 seconds.  I stayed in gear, and power returned normal
each time.  I figured water in the gas and Sunday added some Drygas and took a
ride.  After about a mile, it cut out and I had to coast to the shoulder and
restart.  After that, it was fine for about 15 minutes, then it cut out again,
and this time would not start, leaving me stranded.  I had it towed to my
mechanic, who has had it now for a week.  He has checked numerous things,
including the obvious fuel system and coil, and replaced a rusted flywheel
sensor as well, which turned out not to be the problem.  After determining it
was a wiring problem, he traced it to the so called brain by getting the car
running and tapping on the brain.  He says it only runs when you tap on the
brain (is that DME or DEE?), and suggests I need a new one (please - no pun
intended).  He says that new they run about $1100.00, but you can buy them
rebuilt or used with a trade-in for as little as $400.00 or so, and suggests I
might be able to find one cheaper than he can, and should start looking.  With
this in mind, I have a few questions for you all:

1.  Does this diagnosis sound logical?
2.  Can a existing "brain" be serviced by anyone?
3.  Where might you suggest would be the best places to call to get a brain?

All responses welcome and appreciated.  Please respond to me if possible so I
get it sooner than the digest arrives.
