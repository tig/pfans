     I have a 89 944na with a recently developed rough idle. Replaced cap & 
     rotor which didnt do anything for idle. The car is mis-firing but as 
     soon as gas is given the car runs fine. Some further details are, w/ 
     hood open and listening to car at idle there seems to be a sucking 
     sound, at the rough idle. As soon as gas is given teh sucking sound 
     goes away. Does anyone think that it couls be one of the injector 
     seals? or the injector itself. I have also put injector cleaneer the 
     latest tank of gas but this hasn't done anything. 
     
     Has anyone had similar problems? What wat the fix?
     
     Thanks in advance,

Chris,
I have used Motorworks on many occations as do almost all of the Porsche, BMW,
Mercedes etc shops in San Diego. They have been very friendly to the Porsche
Club locally and to all members that I have talked to about them. I always
talked to Albert when I call them with great results.
