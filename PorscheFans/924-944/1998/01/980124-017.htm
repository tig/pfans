     i'm not sure but, the video sounded like a great idea at first. now 
seems like money has clouded the eyes of a few.  i have learned several 
things since i signed up, hell i even know how my space saver spare was 
to get aired up.  
     i don't work for a porsche dealer, but there aren't many things i 
can not get done on my car. 
   the point is if the idea is to go on for the list, then it should be 
held close to the list or it will end up as something sold by one of 
these catalogs i spend hours looking at. 
this could work for us all, but we will need to a lot of things, setup a 
list of who does what and who will be the central point to keep the 
tapes.
this sounds more and more like a club??????????? and it can work!
