Hello all

To give you all a brief history, I bought the 1984 924 last summer and =
since then have not been able to reliably use the car. For no reason at =
all the car will sometimes just refuse to start. The starter just turns =
over and over but the engine won't fire. When checking for a spark there =
is nothing coming from the coil. I tried the car about half an hour ago =
to go to the shops and nothing was there. I checked for a spark and =
there was nothing, I then did a visual check on the connections and they =
all seemed to check out. I would peridically turn the key and still =
nothing. On about the 10th ot 15th try I heard the fuel pump kick in and =
I then knew that the engine would start, and it did.Once started the car =
never stalls. There is another problem with warm starting but that's =
another story, I can live with that for a while.

At the moment I can get a lift to work but as I'm looking for another =
job I really need to get this sorted out. I've replaced all the =
components I can think of on the ignition system, with second hand parts =
admitedly but nothing has made any difference at all. Does anybody have =
any idea what could could the car to refuse to spark and then, for no =
apparent reason, work fine? I have been told to try a new fuse box and a =
new battery, do either of these sound likely?

Yours in anticipation.

Simon Moore
