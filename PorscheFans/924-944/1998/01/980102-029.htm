Two things:

One:  What holds the glass for the rear hatch in?  Mine's loose and rattles like
all hell.

Two:  Just to be safe, could anything get damaged if you just spray a hose on
the underside of the car to clean it?  It's pretty dirty under there, and I
think there's a couple leaks, so if I clean it all off, then look where the junk
is, that's where the leaks are.

TIA!

Morning All:

Still working on whipping my relatively new-to-me 85.5 N/A 944 into shape for
the auto-x and PCA events and I have some questions:

1. The Bosch Platinum's I removed were jet black with soot from running too
rich (mega gap, too). It also is black at the exhaust pipe and smells like its
too rich. Replaced the plugs with regular Bosch's, changed the wires and will
be changing the rotor and cap tomorrow. How can this engine run so rich with
the sophisticated electronics it has (even if the O2 sensor is out of the
system)? Your thoughts and suggestions please.

2. What are your suggestions for alignment front and rear for a-x/ for PCA? I
am running Kumho's 225 fronts, 245 rears. I can change the f/r toe to suit the
event, but want to leave everything else alone.

3. Sport Koni's will soon be installed front and rear. Your suggestions for
settings with stock springs?

Many thanks.
