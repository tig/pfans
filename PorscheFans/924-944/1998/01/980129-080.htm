"I sometimes get "lumpy" idle, this can mean the engine revs drop down to
400-500 and then swing up to 1500.  When the engine is hot and revs have
been about 2000 or more, when the throttle is released the drop in revs to
400-500 can cause the engine to stall.  When the engine is cold the revs
cycle between 400-500 and 1500 for a while.  I guess this is some sort of
air sensor problem.  Am I right and how do I find which one and fix it?"

I had a similar problem with my 1987 944 Turbo.  Turn out the gasket under the
distributor cap had taken such a set, that common air moisture had gotten in
there.  The main contact was therefore in big trouble.  I replaced the cap and
rotor with official Bosch part, and did the plugs while I was at it.  That was
all it took.

BUT, from time to time, my idle will climb to 2000, 2200, 2400 all by itself.
The climb is slow, say 12-15 seconds to get from normal idle to max.  Then, it
drops all by itself and settles in.  On some days, it does this at every red
light.  Any ideas?
