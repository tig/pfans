No lead wheels.  Just one more reason to look things up before
posting them from memory...

Well I have the brochure in front of me.  The 944 GTP (not GTS)
was raced in 1981 and led to the introduction, in 1982, of
the street 944.  There is 900 lbs difference between the two
cars.  Here is some interesting text:

944GTP: 4-cylinder, in-line, two overhead cams, four
valves per cylinder, liquid cooled, front engine with
turbocharger, 2479 cc, 410 hp.  Weight: 2094 lbs.
Top speed: 185+ mph.

944 Turbo: 4-cylinder, in-line, single overhead cam,
liquid-cooled front engine with turbocharger and
intercooler, 2479 cc, 217 hp, transaxle design.
Weight: 2998 lbs.  Top speed: 152 mph.

Some other specs from the brochure (printed in 1987):

962C: 6-cyl,2999cc, 700 hp, 1929 lbs, top speed: 225+
911 Carrera RSR Turbo: 6-cyl, 2142 cc, 500 hp, 1653 lbs, top speed: 185+
911 Carrera: 6-cyl, 3164 cc, 214 hp, 2756 lbs, top speed: 149
928S: 8-cyl, 4957 cc, 316 hp, 3505 lbs, top speed: 165

Then there is the 1988 Indy car:

Indy car: 8-cylinder, 90-degree V, four overhead cam, four valves per
cylinder, liquid-cooled methanol engine with turbocharger,
2649 cc, 750+ hp, monocoque chassis.  Weight: 1553 lbs,
top speed: 215+

(How did this car do?  I don't follow racing.)

And last:

356: 4-cylinder, horizontally opposed, central camshaft
and pushrods, air-cooled rear engine, 1488 cc, 70 hp.
Weight: 1411 lbs, top speed: 101 mph.

Around here the San Jose PD like to show off their rebadged Corvette that
was snagged from a drug bust.  I'd like to see them stuff a prisoner
into the back of that!  (Checking for stray camcorders in the vicinity
first of course!)

The Cal Highway Patrol also used 5.0 Mustangs for a long time as
pursuit vehicles.  I took traffic school a few years ago.
(Ticketed driving my 944 too fast.  He could have gotten me for doing
about 80 in a 55.  Fortunately he didn't have radar proof and wrote it up
for 67.  I didn't argue...)  The officer teaching the class commented
about how he hated the Mustangs because they handled poorly at speed.
He liked the boats a lot better.

Happy new year to all,

Walt
