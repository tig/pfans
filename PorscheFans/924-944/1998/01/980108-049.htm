Howdy,

As mentioned yesterday, I took the machine into the p-car shop for 
routine oil change and repacking the rear CV Joints.  Unfortunately, they
are so bad, they cannot be re-packed (well, they can, but they'll still
suck).  Since the car is under the used car warranty, they want to stick
on new driveshafts with the new CV Joints on there.  No big deal.
Note one thing, they did not click at all at full lock or anything like
that.  I'm going down today to see the problems with my own eyes.

The next thing is some what of a big deal, both front ball joints are
showing excessive play and wear.  I really shouldn't complain, and I won't.
The car has 67,000km on it, which is quite low for something like the above,
but the car has been tracked and auto-xed, as well as run as low as the front
collars will go.  The PO had it set at that height from day one so it must
have also worn from day 1.  We are going to replace the worn arms with new
arms, maybe even the factory motorsport arms if we can find a price for them.

The last thing requiring replacement is a "hose" between the master and
slave cylinder that is starting to weep.  Anyone heard of this hose?  Is
it normally troublesome?

The bill to the warranty company is astounding with all new parts.  
Thankfully, the days of having to replace everything with new are over and
if I had to pay out of my pocket, the bill could be much lower by rebuilding
parts and only purchasing the CV Joints rather than the shafts.

One other future thing to worry about is the clutch.  The new measurement
is apparently 18mm and max is 34mm for a worn clutch (I'm assuming this
is from the measurement taken from the hole).  Mine is sitting at 29mm,
about 27% left if the measurement is linear.

To play you gotta pay!  And PAY BIG!

Farzaan.
