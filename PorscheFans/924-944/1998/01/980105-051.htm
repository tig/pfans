Just got the Winter '98 Motorbooks International Catalog. A quick flip to the Porsche section brings this book:


Porsche  968
By David Sparrow & Adrienne Kessel. Launched in the summer of 1992 in the UK, this front-engined 2+2 made a significant impact on the public's consciousness. Witness the smoothly contoured beauty of the turbocharged Porsche 968 with its six-speed automatic transmission and 260 bhp in this beautiful, full-color collection.


Hmm... hell of a car. 260 hp, turbo, 6-speed automatic. Maybe they just screwed up on the punctuation. The car of course did come in a turbo version (approx 350 hp), also with a six-speed (manual only), and an automatic (I believe it was a 5 ratio tiptronic).

Oh well.

Hi there Barry,
Sorry you had a problem with BRG's. I was always delighted with their
durability although I have heard of similar complaints about same from others.
I always had trouble (talking wear here) with my off side tires at most
tracks. By off side I mean the unloaded side whoich would be the left side if
it was a predominatly left turn track and the right side at a right hand turn
track. The wear was always on the inside of the tire also. I thing the
asymetrical sidewall of the R1's contributed to this since everyone seems to
want to run too much caster with those tires. Supposedly the caster is built
in, to a degree, because of the stiff inner side wall. 
At Pocono you really had to be careful since the speeds were so high in NASCAR
turn 1 and 2. Seems the inside of the left tire just scuffed across the track
in those situations. I have several photos of cars going thru those corners
with just the inner third of the left tire touching the track. I also heard of
several people moaning about excess tire wear at all of our Pocono events
using the IMSA course. The 911s had considerable wear on their left rear
tires. Of course the fronts on the 44's got the most abuse. 
Going racing again this year? Silly question I know.
Regards, 
Jerry
