My 87 944, being a daily driver, usually gets exposed to salt 5-10 times
during the winter.  I haven't experienced any rust.  My father's old 55
Ford was driven for years in salty conditions and never had any rust.  The
trick is to wash the salt off as soon as possible so that it doesn't have a
chance to eat away at the paint and metal.  Doing that though, you have to
be careful of freezing your locks up, etc.  Of course, if you don't have to
use your Porsche as a daily driver, I certainly wouldn't.  Just my opinion.
