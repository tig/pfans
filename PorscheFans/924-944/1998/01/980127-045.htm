Steve, I guess the first thing to check would be the vacuum lines for leaks.
The problem is probably not the air-flow sensor.  The small wheel which
pushes against the bottom of the control plunger does wear out and is
difficult to feel by hand movement and does give idle surges but not of the
kind you detail.  If it were worn the idle surges would only result in a
100-200 rpm difference in a steady rhythm.
The main lever's pivot bearings, the only other usual wear point, can be
tested by feel--just move it up and down and feel for binding.  If it is
worn, you will get eratic engine performance.
