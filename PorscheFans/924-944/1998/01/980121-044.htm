That, my friends, was beautiful.  It made me laugh continously and shows
that 944 owners definitely have a better sense of humor than 911 owners.
(Apologies to those who own both)

Which reminds me, when talking to my local Porsche dealership about
buying a 944, the common reponse was "sorry can't help you, 944 buyers
don't become 911 buyers, if ya know what I mean."  Is this typical
everywhere or what?!  I guess money talks...
