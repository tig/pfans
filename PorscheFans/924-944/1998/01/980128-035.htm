Well Shaun, not exactly sure what it does, but Porsche issued a tech
bulletin ( I believe #11 in the back of the 924/944/928 parts guide )
for a modification. On my '87, it specified a rubber cap for air box and
for the belt cover. Cost $8 to get these two parts from my local dealer.
Not quite sure why I did it, my car used to have the hose... just seemed
like the thing to do.

As for the function of it, I am not quite sure. Possibly creates some sort
of vaccum to keep the belt area clean (unlikely). The parts guy at Barrier
Porsche didn't know what it was for.

However, I did notice what appeared to be small belt shreds in my air
filter after the plastic gears on my t-belt tensioner exploded and nearly
caused a t-belt failure.

Sorry 'bout the rambling
