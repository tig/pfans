Klaus-Dieter Haegele recently replied to a guy called Alun about the
Alternator ("Fan") belt squealing on his 1983 924. I also have a 924 of the
same year, and have had the problem myself on and off.

It can be a little more subtle than the Alternator being out of alignment.
The Alternator is mounted on Rubber mountings, which are designed to absorb
vibrations. However, after 10-15 years, those mountings start to go hard
and shrink due to being subjected to all that heat. The upshot is that the
alternator will tend to twist on its mountings under the tension of the
belt, which, in turn, will cause the belt to slacken very slightly and slip
- hence the squeal.

The Mechanic who filled me in on all this was a little reluctant to
describe this as a "Design Fault", but then he's the one who gets paid for
replacing the mountings and the belts.

I've also found that, even with new mountings, starting in very cold
whether can cause a slight slip, too (once it slips a few times, the
surface of the belt can become polished which results in the problem
becoming worse). I am currently trying out some spray on "sticky-stuff"
designed specifically for fan-belts. Initial results look quite good - I'll
keep you posted.

          Dave
