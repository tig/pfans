Hello everyone,


I'm not usually one to be out on the streets wanting to race everyone who
pulls up next to me but I had an experience last evening that kicked in the
adrenaline.

We were stopped at a red light when some obviously barely 16 year olds (no
offense to those of you close to that age on the list) pull up beside us in
what was definitely not a stock Honda Civic revving his engine.  This
particular light has a long straight way that leads into some nice curves.
Needless to say, I let the kid think he had me till we hit the curves then
it was goodbye.  

Very enjoyable experience. :) I normally don't do that kind of stuff on the
street but I couldn't let the chance pass by.

Just wanted to share the experience.  Hope everyone has a good day.
