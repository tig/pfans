Hi P-Fans,

I'm contemplating on going to China for 10weeks.  What is the best way to
store a car during the _summer_?  I'd imagine it's a bit different from
winter storage.  I live in Hawaii, so it's also pretty damn humid.  Should
I put the car on Jackstands like some of the list-folks do for winter?  Can
someone provide a checklist of proper storing procedures please?  Thanks.  

The thought of coming back after 10weeks and finding my car not run due to
storing it... Man, I don't know if I'd want to go.  I could ask my friend
to start the car and drive it a bit now and then...but I'm sure he'll race
it and bust up my car.  This is the same guy that left a perminate green
mark on a offramp with his car fishtailing!

I'm looking for that park it, no drive it, no touch it solution.  10weeks
without my 944....it's gonna be hell.

Having not owned a Porsche in a number of months I find myself mildly
interested in taking the plunge again. I have owned 4 different 951's
including two 89's so I am familiar with the basic car. (not to mention having
owned an NA 944 and a 944S).
The question is -- What is the difference between a normal 968 coupe and one
with the M30 option suspension? My local dealer has one of each and both are
low mileage, perfect condition cars. I was under the impression that the
normal 968 had the basic suspension that came with the 89 Turbo's and the M30
suspension had 17" wheels with drilled rotors. The question is am I right and
could someone educate me as to the exact differences. 
I did drive the 968 when they first came out and remember being under whelmed
when comparing it to my Turbo S although it was a really tractable with the
3.0 liter torque and at the time I thought it would make a great daily driver.
Please no one take offense but the thrust of the Turbo S is unique.
Also does anyone have a feel for prices? The dealer in question is in the high
20's for the "normal" 968 and even higher for the M30 optioned car. Of course
the M30 is red and has 6000 miles while the normal one has mileage of about
35,000 and is a grayish green color. The dealer assured me that he was willing
to bargain substantially "when I was ready to buy."
Any info is appreciated along with driving impressions or anything else. TIA.
Jerry
