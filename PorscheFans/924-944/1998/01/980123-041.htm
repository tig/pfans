pfolks,
We can go with a production video if y'all want and Mr. Soo or one of the=
 others can handle it but its going to cost. These folks are not going =
to do it for free and even if they did production costs alone would add =
a lot to the tape cost to members. Sure it would be worth the cost but =
if its not necessary...    I am willing to put together a simple, homemad=
e thing for little to no cost other than expenses which no one would have=
 to pay unless he wanted the video. It would be time consuming but if y'a=
ll want me to I'll do it. On the other hand if Mr. Soo shows that he can =
get it done for not much more than I've proposed then by all means he sho=
uld do it.

I think the point of this was not to have one *expert* do the series but =
rather several of just the regular guys (and gal of course), and I don't =
mean just *regular* list contributors it can be anyone from the list. We =
could then have some neat video of various p-cars and their owners. Remem=
ber the initial poster suggested some track video which I think would be =
great to include (Mr. WOT, Barry, others?).

There is really no limit as to how big the series could be and everyone =
that wanted a video could choose from the series. Of course 1600 videos =
could be a bit much but I don't think _everyone_ will contribute a video.
