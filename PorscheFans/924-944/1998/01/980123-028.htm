Hi All,

I've been following this thread about the sudden onslaught of oversteer
with great interest.  Living in Seattle, I do a lot of driving on wet
streets and am constantly going around corners a little sideways (power
oversteer is fun :-)  ).  I have always felt that one of the 944's
greatest benefits is its smooth and controllable breakaway
characteristic.  In fact, the only time I have ever found myself
fighting the car, was entirely my fault.  I booted the throttle as I
took a low-speed off-ramp corner and rather than the smooth breakaway I
was used to, the rear end just WENT!  I endured three cycles of the
pendulum effect before finally catching it (pure luck on my part).  Like
an idiot, I had spaced the fact that the point I hit the throttle also
marked the road's transition from asphalt to concrete.  Needless to say,
the available traction on the wet concrete was far less than I
anticipated and things happened much faster than planned.  Oh well, live
and learn.

My car doesn't have limited slip, but I am wondering if the addition of
that feature contributes to the sudden breakaway many of you have
experienced in the wet?  It's my understanding that with LSD, when the
tires break, they both go at about the same time.  Without LSD, one of
the tires can go up in smoke, while the other still has some semblance
of traction.  Could this latter effect lead to more gradual breakaway in
the wet?

Thanks,
