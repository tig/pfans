Well, I met Denny Voss (super nice guy, by the way) and "clan" this
afternoon.  He brought his whole family because his son has a couple of
hockey games here this weekend.  However, he only brought his Volvo wagon
and not the van, so my car is still in one piece.

We had a nice chat over lunch (he had a real "jones" for a Chicago-style
hot dog), looked over each other's pictures, discussed interesting driving
routes (he also did the Route 160 trip in southern Missouri, only he went
further east on it than I did), and even watched his son play today's game
(unfortunately, a loss).

I now have put about 200 miles on the 968 since I got it........well,
actually, Denny put about 2-3 miles on it today.  I'm still not sure
whether or not I would go back to a Turbo S if the right deal came along -
I guess I'll just have to wait until I can get it onto the track for some
"real" drivin'.
