Help.  I am in the middle of installing a K-27 Turbo. It is a big job.
I am having trouble finding the second No. 6 allen head bolt under the
turbocharger.  I found the one closer to the block but I can not find
where the other one comes out underneath.  I can see the end in top of
the turbo fitting and I try to project where it comes out but can't find
it.
I believe this is the last bolt holding the old one in.  Do I have to
remove something else from underneath to see it?

I'm not really sure if the K-27 is going to be of any benefit.  I have
been running 1.5 bar of boost for about 6 weeks now with no problems.  I
tried a smaller jet in the turbo boost bolt and hit 2 bar when the head
gasket blew.  I am also going to try installing a gasket myself.  I have
been thinking about swapping heads for one of the milled heads from
PowerHaus to get the higher compression(8:1) ratio.  I also saw a post
about a copper head gasket which is supposed to be thinner than stock
and give increased compression, does anyone know if these are good?  Has
anyone used the Stainless Steel wide fire ring head gaskets available
from PowerHaus?

I'm not going to run these kind of boost pressure any more but it sure
was fun.  I will probable run 1.2 to 1.4 bar and I don't think I will
have any problems.  If I do a Drivers Ed I'll lower it a little more.  I
never was able to get a Dyno lined up but my tires would break loose in
1st, 2nd & 3rd gear under max boost.

Right now I will be happy if someone can tell me where the other No. 6
allen head screw is and how to get it out.  Thanks,

Randall Morton

<< Hi all,
 
 While I currently believe that the 944 block has liners, I'll take some time
 trying to get information from either Porsche or KS to see if the block is
made
 completely of the AlSi alloy or not.
 
 My reasons for believing that the block uses liners are:
 
 -The 944 blocks themselves have a slight separation in the cylinder tops, as
if
 there is a liner installed in the block.>>

I have seen used blocks that appear to have a ring of differing color at the
top of the cylinders at the deck surface. I have also seen brand new blocks,
and have had used blocks decked, and in both cases, it was obvious that the
material was consistant and of one casting.


>> -Liners or inserts are available from KS to "re-new" the block.  These
liners
 are currently used by KS to manufacturer aluminum blocks.  KS casts the
blocks
 around the liners, providing a better bonding and seal to the liners than
 boring and installing.<<

This might be the case now, but it was never that way in production. These
blocks are liner-less. There may be a manufacturer that is casting blocks with
integral liners for a current model, but this is not the case with the Porsche
watercooled engines in the 944/928 series. 

BTW, I'd be real interested to find a shop that knows how to press in an
aluminum liner without ruining it.

Steve R
