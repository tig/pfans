Tony--

No April Fools jokes. Jim Pasha addresses your question in the last issue
of Excellence.  Don't recall the details, but it involved using Euro spec
pistons to raise compression, working on the intake flow and checking fuel
injection.  I have no idea where to get Euro pistons. Engine Builders
Supply in Reno is a likely source, they've got Euro pistons for the 924,
but the last time I checked, they didn't have any for the 944.  Hard to
imagine that swapping chips between an '87 and an '89 would do much, but
I'd be curious to know if there are any differences in the mapping.

I seem to recall a PFan getting a decent increase in power by using a 928
head on a 944, but can't recall what else was involved.
