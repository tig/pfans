There's always "what I should/could/would." It happenned, you're alive in
one piece, don't over-analyze it.

You did manage to remind me of my adventures with curbs and such, I've put
them in a separate post, hope you enjoy it - misery loves company as they say.

Anyway, you asked for comments, I can't resist:

Hardware:

A 951 is  can be a very neutral car.  However, one pays the price by being
very close to oversteer. Its the nature of the beast. My S2 has the turbo S
suspension and is set up for autocross. You sneeze on the throttle at the
wrong point and this car spins. My 924S is(was) much more forgiving and I
still find the difference quite amazing. OTOH, the turbo suspension is
capable of much more. Farzaan has commented on your tire choice and I
agree. What size tires are you running? 225's and 245's will break away
much more abruptly than, say 205's and 225's or 205's all around. 

Software:

This isn't as cut-and-dry as you may think. IMHO, the only way you would
have been able to avoid what happenned is if you had previously experienced
it and practiced getting out of it. Theory and talk just don't go very far.
You have to drive, take the car to a deserted parking lot in slippery
conditions and do bad things, see what happens, and practice until you
don't have to think about what your reaction should be. Autocross is a fun
way of doing this but often doesn't offer enough seat time to truly "get
the hang of it."

In a message dated 98-01-19 19:54:09 EST, you write:

<< When trying to remove an almost stripped out allen head bolt (or any other
 type fastener for that matter) try putting a dab of valve lapping compound in
 the allen heads tip or tool end. The added friction will usually make a tough
 job a snap (no pun intended!). >>

I also heard that the correct torqueing spec for Porsche bolts is to tighten
until it breaks and then back-off one-half turn.

Now I'll just wait until someone e-mails me and says he took me seriously!

Hello P-Fans
	I will be going down to the 24 hours of Daytona. I was wondering if any
fellow P-Fans will be down for the race? We could have melt some marsh mellows
over a camp fire? 

	You can see a team listing on the following page: 
http://www.daytona24hr.com/cgi-bin/Team.asp

	There will be two Porsche GT-1 cars there. Rohr will have a factory Evo GT-1
car. Champion will have a private GT-1 car there as well. 

	Hope to see you there.  Davidjalai@aol.com
