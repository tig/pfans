Are you referring to a 924 or 944?  Honestly, I can't even get the wires
off of my 944 sender without getting those fans out of the way (although
maybe I could if I removed the upper hose).  Since the sender is right up
next to the 'frame' member, I don't see how taking off the wheel would
help.  In any case, it's really not that hard to remove the fans, although
you will need some new tie wraps for the wiring when re-installing it.

All,
Reciently Don posted part numbers for caliper seals.  Is anyone familiar with
the steps and required parts to rebuild calipers?  Mine are really cruddy, and
tend to drag the pads somewhat.  I've even had one lock up at DE once.  They
were about to flag me, but the smoke subsided when the run was over.  I warped
the rotors to.  I'm sure this condition was helped along by the fact that I
had just resurfaced the rotors and one was right at spec, and one was just a
hair below spec in thickness.

All,

Regarding the headlights.  Is there anything special that must be done to
remove the headlight covers?  By "headlight covers" I mean the painted outside
piece.  There are three small screws, one in the rear, and one on each side,
that I though would allow me to pull the metal cover (i.e., headlight cover as
I refered to it) off.
