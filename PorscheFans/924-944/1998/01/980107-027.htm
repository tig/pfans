I am going to pick up a "new" 924 on Saturday, and I picked up the papers
today to get things in order. However, all the papers are in German, so I
don't know what the heck anything means.. I thought some of you nice Germans
might help me out a bit.

First some info on the car: It is an '82 with a 944 Turbo bodykit,
apparently from a company called "Niehoff". Does anyone know them? It looks
like a professional job, the panels all seem to fit very nicely. It has a
Porsche alarm with central locking system, BBS modular rims, leather
interior and 10 speakers (Infinity and Kenwood). The stereo is missing and
the heater controls have been moved and mounted beside the center console,
which leads me to believe that one of the previous owners had an equalizer
or something over the stereo (now there is a gaping hole). Apparently it is
supposed to have 143hp, I don't know how. I think the papers say what has
been done to the car, so I'm posting this message to find out what it is.
The car looks very nice and seems like a bargain. I hope it is. It has been
sitting in a garage for a month or so while the owner was on holiday, so the
battery was drained when I tried to start it. When I jumpstarted the car ran
it a bit rough (RPMs too low to read on the tacho..), but I guess that is
normal when it has been sitting for a while? I let it run for 15 minutes or
so, and it smoothed out when the engine got warm. I guess the car will be
fine when I start driving it regularly?

Anyway, over to the papers:

I have in my hands a piece of paper entitled "Fahrzeugbrief". Looks like it
contains most of the info on the car, and it seems like it has a list of all
previous owners. I am the sixth owner - the first two owners had the car 1
year each (!), the third had it for 6 years, and the fourth had it for 7.
The fifth owner only had it for a month! He imported it from Germany and was
planning to keep it, but he left for Thailand for several months now so he
didn't want to pay to get license plates on the car and leave it standing.

I turn the page in my "Fahrzeugbrief", and skip over what seems to be the
standard specs of the car. Instead I turn my eyes over to "Spalte B" and
"Spalte C", which seem to cover the modifications done to the car.

Here's what it says in "Bemerkungen" for "Spalte B":

Ziff.1: M. Porsche-
heckklappe U. turbo-heckflue-
gel* Karosseriebausatz beste-
hend aus: Frontschuerze, ver-
breit. kotfluegel vuh, seiten-
schwller kennz: FSA-Niehoff*
Ziff. 20-23: A. Gen. VO: 205/

E=12 BBS-RS121 in Verbindg. M.
HI: 225/50R15-80Ha. LM-felge

hinten nur: Pirelli typ P7 U.
P7R; Fulda Y2000, Dunlop SP
Sport Super D4, Yokohama A008
OD. Bridgestone RE71 OD. RD91*

What do the first lines mean? (I can figure out the rim/tire sizes myself.)

And beneath: "Die Richtigkeit der Angaben in Spalte B wird besceinigt. Das
Fahrzeug entspricht insoweit*) - den geltenden Vorschriften. SCH/558180
Eutin, den 8.4.92"

I take it this means "The above information is correct and the car satisfies
current regulations", and that the bodykit was added some time in 1992?

"Bemerkungen" for "Spalte C" says:

"Ziff.7: Leistungsaend. D. Zylinderkopf "143E", Abgaskruemmer "143E",
Nockenwelle " 03401720" zylinderkopfdichtung 931104 33703 auf lasche links*"

The date below says 19.11.93, so I guess that's when the car was upgraded.
The kW figure in Spalte A, "K92/5800" has been erased and replaced with
"102/5500" in Spalte C. Does that mean that the car has actually been
measured to give this effect? And exactly what is "Zylinderkopf 143E" and
"Zylinderkopfdichtung"? I guess "Abgaskruemmer" is a performance exhaust
system.
