Hi Ron,

You have had your share of problems.  The 924 is reliable once you can get
it back into good condition.  If you don't do the work yourself, then find
yourself a reliable mechanic.  I live in SC and don't know the Dallas area
very well, but I do know Zimm's in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area has probably
the best reputation in the country for parts and repair work.  If you do the
work yourself, it is well within the abilities of someone who wants to learn
about the car.

Since you do not have a hard start-cold, but seem to have a hard start-warm,
there are only two things that are most commonly the problem:  (1) the
warm-up regulator (2) the fuel accumulator. The "tromping on the gas" in
order to get the car started is really introducting more air in the air/gas
mixture.  At start up-warm your engine is probably flooded.

(1)  Since the warm-up regulator has just been replaced and (in general if
it's rebuilt by Bosch, it's reliable), you probably have no problem here.
But since the wiring was replaced, I suggest doing two quick checks with the
wires pulled:  (a) with ignition off put an ohm-meter across the terminals
and you should get a reading of around 20-40 ohms.  (If you get 0 ohms or
infinite ohms, the coil has failed--replace the warm-up regulator) (b) since
you replaced the wiring, with the engine not running, but the ignition on,
check the supply voltage across the two wire terminals while still
disconnected.  If O.K. then a fuel pressure test will have to be done later.

(2)  Look up under the car at the fuel accumulator (damper) near the gas
tank (follow the fuel line from the fuel pump to find it).  If there is a
gas deposit on the outside, the diaphram has failed and the accumulator must
be replaced.  No leak? then fuel pressure tests are in order.

Since you had a gas line replaced, it would be a good idea to replace the
fuel filter--use Bosch, not Pep Boys, etc.  The CIS injection system must be
sparkling clean.

Once this is done,  you need to test the fuel pressure.  Get a Haynes
manual, the Bosch Technical Instruction Manual, and pressure tester from any
of the folks advertising in Excellence mag (total cost less than $150), and
by about two hours reading and four hours testing your problem will probably
be pinpointed.

Until then, when the warm start problem occurs, it often helps to get out of
the car and unscrew the gas cap to reduce the system pressure.  The 924
should then start on the second crank with the accelerator pedal pushed to
the floor.

I think with understanding the injection system, you will enjoy the effort.
The work is within the ability of almost anyone.

Best regards,
Lee
