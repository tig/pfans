 I OWN A +79 924 WITH 33,300 ON IT. IT HAS THE 14X6, 4 LUG BOLT WHEELS
(FRONT DISKS/REAR DRUMS). I WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE IT TO 15X6, 5 LUG
WHEELS (4 WHEEL DISK BRAKES). FROM WHAT I HAVE FOUND OUT THIS CAN BE
ACCOMPLISHED BY USING PARTS FROM AN +83 - +86 944. I HAVE CONTACTED A
FEW PARTS WAREHOUSES AND GOT AN IDEA OF WHAT PARTS I WILL NEED AND WHAT
THEY WILL COST. I HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT SOME OF THE NOT SO
OBVIOUS PROBLEMS THAT I WILL RUN INTO. I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY HELP FROM
SOMEONE WHO HAS DONE THIS OR FROM SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT WILL BE
INVOLVED.

1) ARE THE MASTER CYLINDER AND BRAKE BOOSTER FROM A 944 COMPATIBLE
(MECHANICALLY) WITH A 924?
2) DO THE PARKING BRAKE HANDLE AND CABLES NEED TO BE REPLACED AND ARE
THEY COMPATIBLE?
3) DO THE SUSPENSION PARTS BOLT RIGHT UP, AS AN EVEN SWAP?
4) DO THE NEW BRAKE AND SUSPENSION PARTS CHANGE THE WHEEL OFFSETS? IF
SO, TO WHAT? (THERE IS NOT AS MUCH ROOM UNDER A 924 FENDER AS THERE IS
ON A 944, SO THE WHEELS CAN NOT MOVE OUT ANY FARTHER)

  I ALSO WELCOME HEARING FROM ANYONE THAT HAS THE SUSPENSION OR BRAKE
PARTS THAT I AM LOOKING FOR. I AM ALSO INTERESTED IN BUYING 15X6 WHEELS
(PREFERABLY FUCHS STYLE).

  I DO NOT HAVE DIRECT EASY ACCESS TO THE I-NET SO I CAN BE REACHED BY
E-MAIL drym@mps.bellhowell.com OR BY PHONE 7:00 am - 3:30 pm AT
(610)264-4510 ext. 3318. THANKS.
