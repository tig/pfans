Well, it looks like it's my turn to experience the dreaded curse of  the 924
electrical system. The problem started after a night of hard rain. My '77
924 will start Ok, but either immediately after or shortly after I release the
key from the start position to the run position, the engine dies. The way
it dies is like I've just turned the ignition off, including the fact that the
gauges swing back down to zero. At first I though the low tension lead
into the distributor was shorting out, but I fixed that, and it's still
happening.

Now I'm thinking that the ignition switch is faulty, and is turning off when
released from the start position, rather than keeping the ignition on. It's
stopping that quickly.

When it runs, it runs great, and sometimes I can even blip the throttle a
couple of times before it dies.

Any suggestions for me heading into the weekend? Has anyone
experienced this before? I'd like to be able to drive it to P3 (Potomac PCA
meet, my first one) tomorrow, but can't at this rate. I'm thinking I'll try to
tap in a switch parallel to the ignition switch, to keep power on
regardless of what the key switch is doing after release from start
position.

Please help, otherwise I have to take the V*lvo tomorrow!!!!!

Please also reply direct, I've had to switch to digest mode, and my site
administrator is threatening me with removal entirely...
