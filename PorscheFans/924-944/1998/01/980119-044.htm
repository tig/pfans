You might try R-M brand by BASF. Its made by the same folks that make =
Glasorit (Spelling?) but its tailored for the garage type painter. In =
other words its more forgiving. I just tried it on the winter mule (4wd =
Pickup) and it worked great. Nice finish and reasonably easy to spray =
for a base / clear coat paint.=20

Warning - don't prime your car till you select what brand of finish you =
want!! It a very good idea not to mix brands.
Also - if you have not sprayed base/clear before it is quite different =
than lacquer or enamel. If you want details let me know.
