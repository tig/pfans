A Tip. Trying to remove those pesky allen head bolts?
     When trying to remove an almost stripped out allen head bolt (or any
other
type fastener for that matter) try putting a dab of valve lapping compound
in
the allen heads tip or tool end. The added friction will usually make a
tough
job a snap (no pun intended!).
     Good Luck, Davidjalai@aol.com

PS: Have you noticed new aluminum bolts (used on new German makes) are
coated
with a blue-like coating, to prevent dissimular metallic interaction.


David,

    Thanks for the tip on allen head bolts. Here's another one that can
help prevent stripping allen head bolts that are difficult to remove. I
learned it from a buddy who has been working on Porsches and Mercedes for
many years. If the allen bolts does not break free readily, take a punch,
screwdriver, or socket extension and place it against the head of the bolt.
Rap it a couple of times with a hammer (not too hard and on either side of
the head if possible). This "wakes up" the bolt and makes it much easier to
remove. Sometimes the bolts experience thread lock and "waking them up"
makes it a much easier job. On some of the 944 allen heads, I don't even
attempt to remove them without waking them up first (i.e. intake manifold
bolts and turbocharger mounting bolts). Hope you find this as helpful as I
did.
