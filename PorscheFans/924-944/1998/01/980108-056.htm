As of today my '83 944 with 44K miles has been forced into service as my
daily driver. My, up to this point, bullet proof  '84 RX-7 with 173K
miles no longer goes humm.... 8>(  . With absolutely no warning the
engine seized big time and is not salvageable. The price of rebuilt
rotaries start at $2K and go up to $6K depending on how radical you want
to be. I don't think investing $2K in a 15 year old car, worth about
$1K, at best makes allot of sense. So the 944 is now a daily driver
until I can locate a cheap used 12A rotary engine or a replacement
vehicle for daily duty. My heart is set on either a Corrado SLC or Golf
GTI with  the VR6 engine, but they are relatively rare and rather
pricey. Maybe a plane jane Golf will have to do 8>(.

The question is. Anybody have experience with a 944 in winter
conditions. The RX-7 with good snow tires was not that bad for normal
Northwest New Jersey winters, especially with 50 pounds of ballast added
in the "trunk". The 944 has 215/60 Dunlop D60 A2 "High Performance All
Season" tires with a fair amount of tread, mounted on the stock 15 inch
"cookie cutters". Anybody have any experience with these tires in winter
conditions. I would rate the D60 A2's as adequate at best in normal
conditions (They were on when I purchased the car).

If snow tires are required what are your recommendations. We have
Blizzaks on our '97 Passat but have not had much chance to test them in
"balmy" northwest New Jersey. I don't expect this weather to continue
and it could easily be March before the 944 goes back to pleasure use
only. I expect the Blizzaks to be exceptional until they wear out that
fancy compound that is 55% of the tread depth. I bet it won't take long
to wear them out either if this winter continues like it is here.
Blizzaks and Yoko Guardex 600 are available in 215/60-15, 205/60-15,
205/65-15 and 195/65-15 sizes from the TireRack, and elsewhere, for
$70-$85 apiece. It is common practice to choose a narrower tire for
winter tires. For example the recommended snow tire size for the Passat
(standard 215/50-15 Eagle GA's. Talk about s%#!t tires.) is 195/60-15.
The spedo error is less than 2% for any of the tire sizes (when compared
to the 215/60-15 size) listed above for the 944 and of no consequence. I
would mount the snow tires  on the "cookie cutters" and than try and
find a nice set of "phone dials" or ??? to mount the regular tires on
after the winter, if funds are available. The 1982, 83  944 Types
Dimensions Tolerances Manual (little tech manual with tightening
torque's and fastener sizes,  wear limits, etc.) does not list a snow
tire size for the 7 inch wide  15 inch diameter rim size. For the  5.5
and 6 inch wide 15 inch diameter wheels they recommend 185/70 snow
tires. For the 6 and 7 inch wide 16 inch wheels, they recommend 205/55
snow tires.  If I had to guess I would say the 195/65 snow tire is the
best compromise on the standard 7 inch wide 15 inch diameter wheels. The
"cookie cutters" are in decent shape but I am not overly concerned about
them being damaged by salt etc. One winter project was to investigate
getting them refinished/replaced anyway.

Any Ideas or recommendations?

Thanks,

Bob Milovich

Control Arms and Ball Joints for 951

Jim Pasha and the on-line FAQ cover these subjects pretty well.  We still have
yet to see a catastrophic ball joint or control arm failure on track cars here
in Northern California.  Even on some pretty low cars.  I have heard all of
the scary stories from back East, I am not yet convinced as to why they've had
trouble (they claim it is because their tracks are rougher).

As some of you know, my wife also drives our 951 on the track.  I do not want
to have a failure which results in her crashing, or even being scared.  In
addition to the obvious reasons, I like the fact that she enjoys AX and track
driving as much as I do, so I can continue to be funded.  Anyway, I researched
the options pretty carefully when I needed new ball joints, and I decided on
the Zim's rebuilds.  Though not the cheapest out there, they are warranted,
and Zim's is pretty reputable.  I decided against the Fabcar arms, at least
for now because they are so expensive.  The Porsche Motorsport arms are not
cost effective, because they have non-replaceable ball joints just lik ethe
normal factory parts.  Recall that the arms in my '87 came from an '89, so
they already have the stiffer (id est, higher durometer) bushings.

During my research, I spoke at length with Jon Milledge, former IMSA endurance
champion, and Jeff Stone at Kelly-Moss Racing.  They both said that the
Fabcars were a great choice on a money is no object basis.  KMR actually sells
'em.  But they also told me that they never experienced a catastrophic
failure.  Ever.

So, if someone else were paying (e.g., warranty company or race sponsor) I'd
have the Fabcars.  Until then, I will be careful about ride height, inspect
frequently, and stay off the big bumps.

Ride Height for 951 Competition Cars

As i posted not too long ago, I have finally gotten some definitive advice on
ride height:

FRONT:

Measure from bottom of caster mounting block bolt head (for a reference
drawing, refer to the Turbo Manual Supplement).  Should be 130 mm +/- 5 mm for
factory arms, or +/- 10 mm for Fabcars.  Naturally this is best achieved with
cars with adjustable perches.

REAR:

Measure from center of torsion bar tube.  Should be 230 mm +/- 5 mm or 10 mm
as above.  Of course, get as close as you can in the rear with the trailing
arm adjustment if you don't want to pull and re-index the torsion bars.

This information comes from Jeff Stone at KMR.  A very nice man with very nice
competition products for Porsches.  This height range is quite a bit lower
than stock.

Clutches for 951

Always remember, the HD Sachs clutch disc is best.  It costs little more than
the normal factory part, and does not have those pesky little springs on a
secondary damper plate which prematurely break loose.  There are many places
to buy this disc, some refer to it as the "Cup Car" or "Club Sport" disc.  It
is simply a heavy duty Sachs part, available in the aftermarket.
