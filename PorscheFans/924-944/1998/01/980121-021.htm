	Sam,

		Mileage is not a major item with 944's, they have a few
basic flaws which I treat as consumables (see table), and of course the
birth year effects the price as well as the standard features. 

	I have found the '83 to be the best put together year ! It did not
have the neat dash, the better air flow, electric seats, or cast A-arms, but
it was very well put together, I think that year has held together better
than any other year.

	944 Consumables:
		Item					Cycle
Est. Cost
		Gas				- 	every 375 miles

		Oil 				-	every 3k
30
		Brake Pads		-	every 12k
100
		Trans-oil			-	every 24k
20
		Motor mounts 	-	every 40k
200
		Water pump		-	every 65k
500
		Timing Belt		-	every 30k
250
		Alternator		-	every 90k
300
		Tires				-	every	40k
500
		Smiles			-	every mile
All of the above ( but cheap at twice the price)

	Regards *,

Dan

	     This may sound like a dumb question, but I wanted to see how
big an 
	     effect mileage has been on other's 944 experiences.  I'm
currently 
	     looking at an '83 that is going for a good price.  I was going
to get 
	     it checked out by a local Porsche shop and was just wondering
if any 
	     other readers had discovered particular problems on these early
models 
	     other than the obvious belt, clutch, and water pump.  
	     
	     The car was not upkept by a Porsche fanatic, but does have
maintenance 
	     records.  The belt was changed every 30k.  Mileage is about
108k on 
	     the original engine and transaxle.  The owner reports the car
has been 
	     utterly reliable and he's never had any problems.  The car
seems to 
	     run strong and has no real rattles.  Oil pressure is about 2.5
at idle 
	     and jumps to 4/5 once underway.  Transaxle seems to shift fine.
I 
	     would expect to make minor modifications and refresh the
interior, but 
	     did want to avoid any major problems.  The car would be a daily

	     driver, and I would like to use it in an occasional driving
event but 
	     no competition.  Any experiences or hints on what to look for
would be 
	     appreciated.
	     
	     Thanks in advance for any help or hints,
	     Samuel
