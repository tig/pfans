Mr. Haynes forgot what it was like to pull his first injector.  On an '81,
if they have never been pulled before, you will probably be surprised that
they do come out.  You will need a fuel injection puller--angled flat iron
with a cut out half-ellipse--to do the job right.  If I recall, on the "81
you might have to file out the puller a little for it to fit on the
injector.
Move the fuel lines aside.  Slip the puller on the injector, insert a large
screwdriver or small prybar in the puller, and leverage on a block of wood
cut to fit for a pivot (you might need more than one different size,
especially if you have a "big throat" installed.  Ever so carefully rock
your pull on the injector back and forth (by re-positioning) no more than !0
degrees from vertical for a few seconds.  To remove, pull straight out.
Before you start, it would be a good idea to have some new O rings handy,
because given the difficulty of pulling, they might be dried out and
cracked.  It's unlikely all injectors have failed.  Use a stethoscope and
compare the sound from each when your engine does run.
Injectors rarely wear out.  As James Weber says, "the fuel injector would
easily fall into the category of 'most often replaced when not really
needed'."  About the only time an injector won't work is fuel contamination.
If you aren't getting gas to the cylinders, my first suggestion would be to
check the air flow sensor for movement.  Second suggestion would be to check
your fuel filter for clogging.  In all likelihood, from your description,
the fuel problem is in the distributor.  Have you cracked the injector lines
to see if fuel gets out of the distributor?
