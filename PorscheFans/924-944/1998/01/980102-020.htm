Greetings from Sunny Miami!!! My name is Lenny Ramjattan and I'm a
Regional Systems Manager in the U.S. Coast Guard. I proudly own a 1983
944 Meteor Grey (Metallic Silver) w/ Cookie Cutter rims. It was
purchased from a doctor over in Hialeah who never really did any
maintenance at all. One of those "turn-the-key-and-go" type of guys who
only knew where the petrol cap was. I practically stole it from him for
$1,350 !!! It had two problems: the one of which we all know of.....the
famed quagulated oil in the cooling system that ended up being the
o-ring seals in the oil cooler; the second was hesitant starting cold
but would happily start up once it was warm. My dad, who owns a major
paint/body/mechanic shop in Downtown Miami since 1969, told me to grab
that car QUICKLY...... he knows what was up with those symptoms. In no
time flat, that oil problem was solved. However, the reluctant starting
from cold in the mornings gave me and my dad a good run for the money.
After a good couple of months of troubleshooting that Bosch Motronic
system, it turns out that it was both of the flywheel sensors, one for
RPM and the other for sensing TDC/timing was not functioning properly.
Once that was taken care of,  my 944 pretty much ran happily. I did end
up changing some parts along the way of time, some cosmetic, some
important. I drained and replenished the transaxle gearbox fluid
(something every owner needs to know of) because mine was a dark, burnt
color. Changed out the disc pads on all four wheels. Of course, new
tires Viper HX P215/60R15 and a body respray at my dad's paint booth was
in need. I changed out the weather seal for the pop top because of
leaks. Had to replace a cracked boot on the left inner CV joint (exhaust
heat?) and the two front steering rack accordian boots (This is a
standard rack -n- pinion non power-assisted steering). Changed out the
engine mounts with original spec mounts. My dash top is cracked so I
opted for the cheaper plastic dash cover. I'm not entirely please with
it but since it helps make the interior look a little more newer, I
guess it'll do. A good number of instrument lamps were replaced. I added
that steering wheel emblem plaque to dress up the interior. The seats
are way shot and foam is actually dropping here and there but I put seat
covers to tide me over until I'm ready for either a recover or upgrade
the seats. I added the Bursch exhaust glass pack system aft of the
catalytic converter and I'm pleased with the sound it emits, though my
fiance' says that she preferred the stock (quieter) system. Oh well,
can't please everybody. Judging from what you've just read, I'm like
most of you who prefers to do most of the work by yourself at home. We
all have a budget of some sort to live by and Uncle Sam doesn't have
much to go with when I'm supporting this little baby and expecting to be
married soon. I'm not a speed junky especially when though this a non
turbo but I can give some opponents a bit of excitement thrills!  I try
to keep highway speeds about the nominal speed that the rest of the
traffic flows at due to how easy this color attracts FHP (Florida
Highway Patrol) quite often. Once I'm in uniform and they see that I'm a
fellow Federal law enforcement officer too, they tend to be a little
more merciful!  You know what really ticks me off about Miami drivers?
They simply are too damn aggressive, just pulling from lane to lane
WITHOUT using any turn signals or indicators. So please be courteous on
the roads and let the other drivers know what you're going to do.
Besides, we all don't want to be paying unnecessarily for a body repair
that could have been avoided. Just a tid-bit to pass to some of
you.......I realized a bit more engine throttle response just by simply
changing out the air filter and the fuel filter as well as better
mileage! I love reading everbody's entries and perhaps learn from each
other's experience. Looking forward to more entries and replies!
