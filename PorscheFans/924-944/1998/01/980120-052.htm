Hey P-Fans, I need your input...

Which Porsche 924/944/968 models would you consider to be most historically
significant?

Would it be the 924 Carrera GTP or the GTR;  maybe a silver-rose Turbo S/Cup
Car;  or a 968 Turbo RS (twin turbo, 3.0l, 350hp). My vote would be ALL OF
THE ABOVE!!

According to the officials masterminding the event, this year at the Laguna
Seca Historics, Porsche will be celebrating their 50th Anniversary by having
on display or on the track "one of everything" Porsche has ever made. I
don't know about the rest of you, but that concept boggles my mind. I asked
if this meant street cars or race cars and the answer was BOTH. Well, I may
actually be able to see all of the above!!

If you regularly follow the list you already know that I'm helping to
coordinate and pass information along to all the 924/944/968 P-fans who are
interested in attending. If you aren't already on my list, just drop me an
e-mail and I'll add you in and keep you posted.

Just this last week we sent everyone on the Monterey list a registration
packet that allowed them to sign up a month earlier than the Panorama add
for the MBR-PCA activities, including a reception dinner to be attended by
Porsche race drivers including Jackie Ickx, and the Porsche Corral with room
for ONLY 700 Porsches. Both of these activities are expected to "sell out"
early.

Now to my main question... the Porsche Corral will feature 60 "Historically
Significant" Porsches and I have been in touch with the man determining
which cars will be represented. I would really like to hear from you folks
which 924/944/968 cars you think should be parked on display in the corral.
Although you can respond to me directly if you prefer, I would like to
suggest a more open forum -- the list itself.
