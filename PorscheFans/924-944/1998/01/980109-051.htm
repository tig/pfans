How do you isolate the slight play from the wheel bearing from the ball joint.
In auto-x tech, we normally pull the tire like we are hugging it and tugging
back and forth to feel wheel bearing play.  Most cars have a slight amount.
Is there a different axis to use when checking the balljoint?

Just a note.  Some people are quite alarmed at the early demise of my ball
joints.  You probably shouldn't be.  You probably drive your car 10X
easier than mine and about 15X easier than Paul :)  I've done all the dirty
deeds of 944's, dropping the clutch at the drag strip, riding the curbs
at the track, going from full jounce to full rebound in high speed auto-x
chicanes, and all the while when my car was lowered to about 1 finger gap
between the wheel well and the 225/45R17 tire.  So, if you think your 
ball joints will wear out at 42,000mi, I doubt they will.  I also doubt
that mine are as worn as the shop thinks they are, just being cautious
because they know how the car is used.  I expect these things to happen
when a car is put through that stress.  Have you ever looked at the scheduled
maintenance of a race car?  Stunning!

The only place I drive calm is on the street :)  And, I'm really easy on the
transmission (I hate replacing synchros)
