In a message dated 98-01-27 07:47:38 EST, you write:

<< We were stopped at a red light when some obviously barely 16 year olds (no
 offense to those of you close to that age on the list) pull up beside us in
 what was definitely not a stock Honda Civic revving his engine.  This
 particular light has a long straight way that leads into some nice curves.
 Needless to say, I let the kid think he had me till we hit the curves then
 it was goodbye. >>

Roxy,

Should we now refer to you as "Ms. WOT"?
