I'm puzzled. Recently, I have been experiencing a loud, screeching noise =
emanating from the passenger seat area. Typically, sound occurs when =
encountering extreme lateral g-forces on either right, or left hand =
turns. Sounds are also emitted under extreme braking conditions. No =
problem when accellerating.

While there never seems to be enough traction, road grip is good. =
Understeer is noticed on sharp turns, as well as chassis roll, and =
'drifting' will eventually occur on long sweepers.

Additional symptoms:
Sound is only emitted when Girlfriend 1.0 is present.=20
Driver experiences extreme thrashing from Girlfriend 1.0 immediately =
after screeching noise stops.

Question:
Has anyone else experienced this?
Why does it occur only with Girlfriend 1.0? Should I upgrade to 2.0?
Is this a problem?(period)

First person with the correct answer (i.e.-Girlfriend 2.0's phone =
number, gets Girlfriend 1.0's phone number.)

85 944 NA (stands for Needs  A .....Turbo, 8 more valves, dual ignition, =
etc.)
