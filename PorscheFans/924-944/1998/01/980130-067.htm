Hi P-fans,

What is going on with the 968 market value.

About a month ago a fellow P-fan wrote that he bought a 93 968 Coupe in
Florida for USD17,500.

In Excellence magazine (as featured on Seifeld) 3 968's were sold in the
last month for:

93 968 Coupe 19K miles perfect condition USD27,000
93 968 Cab 44K miles interior like new, exterior some stone chips
USD33,500
95 968 Cab 30K miles excellent condition USD36,000

968 should be a commodity traded on the Chicago Mercantile exchange,
lots of money to be made in extreme fluctuations in price like these.

Somebody must have been taken to the cleaners. A 55% difference between
highest and lowest price for a 93 coupe!

Am I missing something, or is it that the 968 is traded relatively
rarely as to make it's current pricing difficult.

Is the market looking for a price value. I noticed that most Blue Book
and Edmunds trade-in values for a 93 coupe is in the order of USD15,500
- USD16,000 whereas the prices the cars are traded at are USD10,000
more. Even if the car lot is making a killing (let us say USD4,000) it
still does not justify the price discrepancies.
