Many thanks to Ken K. for the tip on using a spare piece of vacuum line
as a stethescope to find vacuum leaks - this works better (IMHO) than
using brake or carb cleaner. Using it, I was able to find vacuum leaks in
places I would never have imagined (the big FI boots), as well as
discover that the little vacuum lines I had always though were the
problem had in fact sealed up quite nicely. Of course, I now have big
blue (RTV) bands around my intake boots, but at least they hold!

Thanks a lot Ken - this just goes to show you should never take the
simple, basic things for granted...
