Why should the repair shop be worried about how much money your going to
spend, that should be for you to decide if you want to pay their price.
Sure they can say it wouldn't be worth their effort & your money, but its
your car.  If you are like most of us, you want your car to have every
single feature working that it has.  As far as it not being worth their
effort, maybe they aren't quite qualified or experienced enough to fix it
correctly.
