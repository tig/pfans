The CIR 2nd Annual Chili & Dessert Cookoff !

Saturday January 24: Arrive 4:30, Eat 5:30
     Ladies  and  gentlemen,  start  your..chili? Yep, get your competitive
engines  revving  up  with  the  CIR 2nd annual chili and dessert cook-off.
Here's  the  deal:  make  up a big pot of your best chilli (preferably in a
plug-in  pot) and/or dessert and bring it to Joyce and Harry Crane's place.
A  panel  of  professional tasters will give awards for best chili in mild,
wild  and  no  beans  categories plus a best open dessert category. Judging
promptly  at 5:30. International rules apply.  If you are not into cooking,
that's OK too, come on down and join the fun.
     Beverages,  sour  cream, onions, shredded cheese, and crackers will be
provided. Cost is a paltry $5 a person to cover costs.  If coming, call the
Crane's ASAP (317-875-0922) and let them know how many will be there.

Directions:  Take  I465  on  the west side of  Indy to 86th Street exit, go
west  on  86th  about 1/4 mile to Green Ridge Drive and turn right into new
"West  86th"  addition,  follow Green Ridge until it ends and turn right on
Harmon Ridge Court, look for house # 6326.

Dinner at Gisela's Kaffekranzen

Saturday February 7: 6:00 PM. Sharp!
     Nestled  in  historic  downtown  Zionsville  is one of the area's BEST
German  restaurants.  For  many  years, the CIR folks have gathered at this
homey place for authentic German food and drinks. I spoke with Andreas, the
owner,  who  told  me  that they would have the buffet available, with such
delicious  choices  as  sauerbraten,  schnitzel,  pork roulade, veggies and
more.  Of  COURSE  there are desserts!  (Yum)
     Dinner  cost is a bargain at $15.95 per person, beverages and desserts
extra.  Space is limited, so please call Mike or Sandra Farr ASAP
at (317-299-3643) to reserve your place.

Directions:  122  South Main Street, in downtown "old" Zionsville. Gisela's
is up the stairs on the second floor.

Hi,
After six years having to explain in great detail (read; argue) with
the 911 crowd, the 928 crowd, Porsche Ag., PCNA, Porsche parts
salesmen...and women.. that Porsche REALLY DID make a 931'S, I
guess I'm getting a little tired. 
I own a 1980 931'S. 
IT REALLY DOES EXIST.
IT REALLY IS A GREAT CAR.
I'm now on record for being a fanatic, no?
I'm sorry for not responding to Don Kennedy "ON THE LIST"..(.I did
e-mail him directly though). That WAS rude. 
The best place to get information on the 931'S is in the Gold
Portfolio on 924's...(I think this is still available through Auto
Atlanta at $23.00).
This is a quote from the Gold-Portfolio ...an article on the 931
by Car and Driver:
"..."Sport Group" package (code-numbered M471)...includes big
ventilated four-wheel discs (911 ventilated rotors pinched by
928 calipers) five-bolt, sixteen-inch wheels with 205/55VR-16
Pirelli P7s; sport-shocks (Koni adjust. sport shocks) a 14mm rear
anti-sway bar to accompany the stock 23mm front (my car has a 
25 mm front bar); a four-spoke steering-wheel; and an "S" decal
(for the hood).
Jim Pasha of Excellence mag. had a '81 931, (with VERY RARE
limited -slip) and can REALLY tell you A LOT about these fantastic
cars. (His tire recommendation is the Yoko AVS intermediates...which
he had on his 931...and also his '81 924. I have tried them and they 
are PERFECT...quiet...and STILL capable of totally humiliating
Corvettes!)
There are also a few '79 924'S's out there...(we have one of those, too).
(Don Istook on "THE LIST" yesterday explained THAT). 
Again, this was the M471 package...or early 924 Turbo...without the Turbo
engine.
A lot of years have passed...and a lot of fads (aftermarket wheels etc.)
leaving a lot of confusion as to what REALLY should and should NOT
be on these little 924's and 931's. After SO many people have talked
these cars down (BOMBSHELL WARNING!; ...WHO do you think DESIGNED
the "Audi" block?), EVERYONE seems to think they came with square
wheels.
....but then I DID warn you, I am a fanatic, no?
Again, sorry for not responding on the list...but then as you can see,
once I get started...
One more thing, the "S"designation was for US cars...someone told me this was
to make people in the USA feel a little better that the 924 Carrera GT
would NOT be sold here.
