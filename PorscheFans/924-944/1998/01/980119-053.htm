I have just faxed off a little note to Speed Bleeder Products in Lemont, Il
(west of Chicago) asking if they have an application chart/cross-reference
for Porsches.  I explained to them that I would post to the list any
information they could supply (and, I mentioned that this 924-944-968 list
alone had about 1600 members).  I think that should get some kind of rapid
response (there is power in numbers).  As soon as I hear anything, I will
let you know.  Who knows, maybe I can make a deal with them for bulk
purchases (although, at only $6-7 each, there probably isn't a whole lot of
room, but, you never can tell).
