 I've been looking to buy a 944 for about a month and have driven a 944,   
 944S and 944 Turbo.  Both the standard 944 and the S performed to         
 expectations, however, the Turbo (a 1987) has me confused.  First, it     
 seemed a bit slower off the line than the other two, and second, the      
 exhaust sounded a bit "tinny" or "airy" (lame words I know but the only   
 two I can think of to describe).  I was expecting it to sound smoother    
 and deeper than the other two.  Also, I was waiting to hear a turbo       
 "whine" like you hear in a Volvo or Saab.  No?                            
                                                                           
 Lastly, the Turbo I drove had a timer on it so that even after you turn   
 the ignition off, the engin keeps running for a minute to allow the Turbo 
 to cool down.  Is that necessary and/or ususal?                           
                                                                           
 I know it's unreasonable to ask for advice on what I tried to describe,   
 so if anyone has any advice on what I should listen and look for, it's    
 appreciated.                                                              
                                                                           
 Ben.

<< I'm wondering, is this a typical idiosyncrasy that I just need to get
 over or is this a symptom of a different problem? >>

Mine did it to.  I played around w/ it with some pliers and couldn't get it to
stop.  It just quit on it's own for some strange reason!  Now i have
fiberglass tape insulating my headers, so if it started vibrating against them
now, I wouldn't hear it, so it may or maynot be doing it again.
