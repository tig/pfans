Gang,

I suggest that we come to an agreement as to who the P-car expert
technicians are, and then contact them to see who would be interested in
becoming part of this project.  PCNA as a sponser would be a plus, but
not a requirement.

My company is based in the Detroit area, in case anyone cares.  Also,
conversion into European PAL or SECAM format is not a problem.  Many of
our "How-to" and "service" videos are distributed around the world. 
Video acquisition formats that we use can be anything from HI-8 to
Digital Betacam.  My suggestion to keep costs down would be to use one
of the "Industrial" formats, as these videos are not destined for
broadcast.  Duplication and distribution are also no problem for us.

Sounds like plenty of interest, let's do it!
