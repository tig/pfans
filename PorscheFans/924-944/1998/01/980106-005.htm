You need to pull the radio and pop off the covers.  Inside, look for the 
volume control and spray the inside of the control with contact cleaner.  
Turn the knob back and forth as you do it.  If you careful you can do 
this while the unit is in the car and not loose battery power and reset 
the radio.

Be very careful when selecting contact cleaner.  Some versions do not 
like plastic and melt it!  Some varieties contain a lubricant which is 
fine for audio controls.

Enjoy your ride!

>Thanks for the help!
