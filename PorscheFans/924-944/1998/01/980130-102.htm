<< I stripped out a 6mm Allen Head Bolt on the Cam cover.  It is the one
 under the S and is a little hard to get at.  Anyone know the best way to
 get it out.  The guy before me had it wallowed out pretty good and I
 completely finished it off, it is rounded.  I was thinking of getting a
 long drill bit and carefully drilling the head off.  Anyone have a
 better idea.  Thanks,  Randy M. >>

Use an "easy-out", is that what they're called?  It's like a tapered, reverse
thread drill bit looking thing.  You'll need the size who's tip fits just into
the goughed out hole. The grooves dig in when you turn it with a wrench.

I'ld imagine a good hardware store should have them.  Or plumbing supply
stores.
