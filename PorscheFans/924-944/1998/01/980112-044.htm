Ahh, Sears Die hards. Somehow, the product in the normal application is
not up to high-G or rough road operation. Trashed the plates in the one
in my 944 twice. Finally figured out that the paltes aren't very thick
and are subject to damage in high-G corners. It seems the electolyte has
significant mass and the baffling is minimal in each cell. Mine died
after one autocross season. Went to the marine-type and had no problem.
I had to take a size a little longet than stock because they don't make
a group 41 in that series.

The Optima batteries have problems, too. Seems we've had a rash of
failures after the batteries are 6 months old. They just go dead. I'm
not sure about the quality of manufacture of any battery these days. 
But I've still had my best luck with Die-Hards for the track. Remember
to use a marine battery box for track cars.
