"When VW ran into financial trouble
and changed management, the 924 project would have been scrapped if Porsche
had not bought it from VW. "

(Not to mention Porsche spent 62 million developing the 924)

"The 924, which used VW and Audi parts"

(Name one Porsche that does not have VW parts in its development.  Have you
ever looked at the basic design of the 911 chassis or engine)

Not intended to flame anyone ,  Just some late night observations.

Always alone when it happens.  Then after 15 to 20 minutes starts up no
problem."

My 87 944T did about the same.  I removed the distributor cap and noticed
corrosion and damage at the center electrode.  I replaced the cap and rotor
while I was there, and it cranks, and stays running.  New cap ~ $45, new rotor
~$30.

"I am currently trying to troubleshoot a noise from the distributor cap

after only 1-2 minutes of running. "

Did you notice the gasket under the dist. cap?  These things take a set, and
become about 1/8 of their original thickness.  If they aren't thick enough to
resist the cap when the 1/4 turn fasteners are engaged, the cap can actually
rattle.  Look for mild scratches/scarring on the bottom outside edges, or
bottom face.  New gasket ~ $2.
