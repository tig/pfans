Sounds neat. Should be easy enough to recruit listmembers to take on a =
project but how could we distribute this to all interested members... pur=
chase? say, for just cost of tape and shipping? or maybe contributors cou=
ld receive some amount of royalty if we could keep cost reasonable? I wou=
ld be willing to transfer individual videos to a master and then send to =
interested listmembers. If we had enough contributions we could do a seri=
es like "Engine compartment", "Suspension and Brakes", "Transmission", =
etc. The more I think about this the better it sounds. Lets get some disc=
ussion going.
