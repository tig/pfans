I agree with Farzaan.  Sometimes it is better to give up than to try to keep
the car going in a straight line.  In most of my situations I've been a victim
of the over correcting virus.  Resulting in a car that is way out of control,
and you having no real idea where you are headed.  (hey it gets confusing when
the car is swinging back and forth).

If you end up putting both feet in; the car simply goes in whatever direction
it was moving in (which may be good or bad).

As was said though everything depends on the circumstances and conditions.

As far as the control arm breaking.  Usually when you hit a curb, the weakest
link is going to go.  In this case the control arm broke.  In other cases the
wheel and hub break.

Sometimes, small things come in big packages but
  once in awhile, a big thing is crammed in to a
    small package, and the package breaks.
