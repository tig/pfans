so eloquently stated:

[big snip]

>3) change oil every 3-5,000 miles, or every year if don't reach mileage

Boy, this is quite a change from the factory recommended interval of
15,000 miles on my S2!

>4) use 20W50 oil

This may be OK for petroleum based oil, but it is too high a viscosity to
use with a high quality synthetic.  The use of heavier than necessary oil
leads to an increase in oil temperature (more pumping losses) and =
actually
less protection in the bearings because the oil can't flow easily enough
through tight clearances on a healthy engine.  For these reasons (among
others) I recently switched to Red Line 10W30 synthetic.  Red Line
actually recommends the 10W30 for 944 turbo motors also.  They say it =
will
allow the turbo to spool up a bit faster due to the lower friction, and
they also claim it will protect the engine just as well or better as any
20W50 petroleum oil.  Of course it costs 5-6x as much so it better :-)
