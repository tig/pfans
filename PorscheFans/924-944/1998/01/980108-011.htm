(I am reading the 944 battery thread from the web archives, so please 
excuse me if this subject has already been covered).

NBC Dateline did a story on Sears batteries a few months ago.  NBC
bought a Sears battery, discharged it, and then returned it to a Sears
store. Later on, they went to a different Sears store that was nearby
and found their used battery back on the shelf for sale as a "new"
battery. (Before they returned the battery to Sears, NBC had burned a
"NBC" symbol into the battery case in order to identify it as theirs).

NBC also sent a "new" Sears battery to this private lab which tore it
apart for analysis.  The lab concluded that the battery was not a new
battery, but a used one. (Sears disputed those findings).

NBC didn't establish whether this was a widespread practice or limited
to just a few stores.  However, they did find a Sears training manual
which emphasized that battery returns hurt their business.

Last year, Florida's Attorney General's office launched an investigation 
into allegations that Sears was selling used batteries as new.

Personal note: I have had two Diehard batteries go dead on me, both
times when I let my 944 sit for a few weeks.  The first one was
installed by the PO, and it died about a year after I got the car.  The 
second one died after two years of use, and a few weeks after I saw the 
NBC story.  Both batteries were purchased in the Central Texas area.

I replaced the last Diehard with a battery from Walmart (snigger).  I've 
let the car sit for a few weeks since, and the battery is still strong, 
so I don't think there's anything wrong with the car.
