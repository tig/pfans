Subject: 944 as winter driver in NE
As of today my '83 944 with 44K miles has been forced into service as my
daily driver. My, up to this point, bullet proof  '84 RX-7 with 173K
miles no longer goes humm....
......If winter tires are recommened which tires...
Robert,
I live in Michigan, have used Blizzaks on my Volvo and Ford van for several
years now, and I strongly recommend them. Just the other day I drove the van
about 300 miles on snow covered roads and it was solid and responsive even
at speeds the 4X4's wouldn't drive. The Volvo was plowed into a parking
place after a 15 inch snowfall and drive out without clearing a path thanks
to the Blizzaks. IMHO, any snow tire should be changed with 50% of the tread
is gone as it has lost most of the performance that caused you to buy it in
the first place.
Does NJ warrant snow tires? I would say it depends not only on the weather,
but also your priorities. The way I see it, all-season tires do everything
mediocre. If you want "the best", separate tires for winter and summer are
the way to go. One caveat however, as you probably already know from your
Passat, dry/wet road performance is SIGNIFICANTLY compromised by snow tires.
If most of the time the roads DON"T have snow on them, then the snow tire
will require greater stopping distance and much more moderation in the
turns. Blizzaks, in particular, are so slippery the first few hundred miles
you can get the impression of very low tire pressure. And although it gets
much better once those miles are behind you, they still are a MAJOR
compromise unless the road is snowy. In the snow, nothing comes close...
including 4 wheel drive... because snow tires also help you stop and turn. 4
wheel drive does not. By the way, my first purchase for the M-Class when it
comes in later this month will be a set of Blizzaks.
This past year a number of other manufacturer have introduced new snow tires
which sound very interesting, but I haven't seen any comparisons. If you
haven't checked out TireRack's home page, this part if it might be of help
to you: http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tests/2vs4.htm . They go into much
greater detail on a lot of what I've been talking about and their entire web
site is a terrific resource for anyone wondering about tire choices. They
have quite a number of performance comparisons to view.
I think you're on the right track as far as tire and wheel size are
concerned. I put my Porsche away for the winter and don't have first hand
experience with it and winter, but everthing you said is quite consitent
with my experiences with other cars.
