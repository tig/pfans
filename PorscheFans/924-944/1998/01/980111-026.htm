Don, yes one of those microswitches is for there for when the ignition is
on and the other is for when it is off and you want to remove the panel. 
You mention 3 switches; my early '85 has only two that are stacked together
and mounted on the aft portion of the cable drive rail (mounted in the rear
quarter panel and attached to the motor assy).    When the ignition is on,
the first switch should stop the lifting arms before they can disengage
from the track in the roof panel (if they do you may lose your roof at
speed), when the ignition is off or in accy. pos, the second, slightly
further aft switch is active and will let the drive cable go back a little
bit further to allow the lifting arms to disengage the roof panel.  The
tricky part for me was adjusting the lifting arms so that they lifted the
roof evenly.  Once you do this, close the roof (with ignition on) and
observe where the arms stop.  If they disengage, then you have to adjust
the limit switch assy further forward in the track.  It's really pretty
easy. 

If you really have 3 microswitches back there, then things may be different
on a late model car (unless the third switch you are referring to is the
one towards the front of the roof, which cuts off the motor if no roof
panel is installed - this is just an on/off switch without any adjustment I
think).  Hope this helps.
