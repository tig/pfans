I had a similar problem with my headlights ('77 924). Two possibilities
(both of which happened w/ my car, neither of which required
replacement of the motor or wiring!): The connector is a standard AMP
connector, with removable pins. There's a special tool (simple, too) used
to remove the individual pins from the plastic connector body - should be
able to either borrow from an electronics tech or buy at an electronics
supply store. Most likely one or more of these pins is making a poor or
intermittent connection due to the female side being worn. Once the
female pin is removed from the motor side connector, it can be bent
closed slightly to provide a better contact, then re-inserted.
Unfortunately, to get to that side of the connector, you have to remove
the motor from the car (easy) and stretch the rubber boot off of the end
of the motor (a real pain!).

Once the boot is off, you can also see one other possible source of
failure - the diodes. There are two of them - one had failed in my case
due to motor overload. They can be tested with any multimeter with a
diode check setting quite easily at this point. They are cheap and easy to
replace.

The long and the short(!) is, a new motor would probably solve your
problem, but so would spending a little more time and a lot less money!

Let me know if you need further help on this.
