A clamp on the upper radiator hose on my '84 944 came loose, the hose
hit the alternator pulley, developed a gash and proceeded to spray the
engine with coolant. Fortunately I was able to see the massive amounts
of coolant leaking and caught the problem a few minutes after it
happened.

This hose was made in 11.83 and the PPN stamped on the hose is
944-106-239-02. This is the large hose that goes from the top of the
radiator (driver-side) to the block, right next to the coolant bleed
screw. Went to the dealer and was given a hose that looked a little
different, PPN 944-106-239-07. I was told this is an updated part.  Told
him to double-check the year and was given the same answer.

Installed it this weekend and it doesn't quite fit. On the radiator side
it barely fits and there is very little room for the clamp to secure it,
unlike the old hose. This hose also does not clear the fan shrouding,
resulting in the upper fan shrouding digging in to the hose as it turns
toward the block.

Can somebody with a parts list or manuals please check the PPNs and let
me know if this is really an updated part, or as I suspect a hose a for
a different year. The old hose was symmetrical, maybe the new one needs
to be mounted in reverse? TIA.
