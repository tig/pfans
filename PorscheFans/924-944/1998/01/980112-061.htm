Well, having just recently shelled out the big $$ and replaced the 
factory control arms with 90k miles on 'em with the Fabcar units, I'm 
just wondering if there's any market out there for used 951S control arms 
with worn ball-joints... ;)

Anyone want these things? Or know any control-arm rebuilders that I could 
dump these things off on? Best offer takes 'em, all they're doing is 
taking up shop space as it is... 

regards,
Dave

Subject: Porsche Market Letter

A while back, Porsche Market Letter was offering to print free ads for
people who originally sent their ads into local PCA newsletters. Does
that offer still stand, and what do I need to do to take part in it.
(Yes, I know PCA has said we should not do this, but if members want
their ads published there as well, I'm not going to deny them).

PML can be contacted at PMLetter@aol.com

I'm curious, why would anyone suggest not sending an ad to PML? I know the
owners of this magazine. They are a husband an wife couple who are active PCA
members and supporters. Pat Vanbuskirk (wife half of the couple) is co-editor
with me this year of the San Diego Region newsletter, the Windblown Witness.

In a message dated 98-01-11 20:57:57 EST, you write:

<< I'm interested in shimming my wastegate so that it is the same thickness
 as the shim in the Weltmeister Performance package.  Does anyone know
 how much thicker the Weltmeister shim is?  Has anyone else done this? >>

Chris and all,

My waste gate is shimmed with washers.  Yes, two small washers on each of the
four bolts holding the wastegate diaphram to the wastegate.  I'ld estimate 1.5
- 2.5 mm thickness.  I'ld imagine you could adjust your max boost by adding
and removing washers.  I think the problem arrises when you don't adjust your
fuel mapping to match your added boost (I do have a non-stock chip).

I have an 87 944S with 52K miles.  After several days of off and on rain (not
exceptionally heavy), I found that the carpet behind the passenger seat to be
soaked with water.

Any obvious places that I should check?

I checked the sunroof drain holes by squirting water into each one to check
for drainage and they seem ok.

Help please...

Well, it was going to happen sooner or later.  I just had my timing and
balance shaft belts changed and in 1k miles, boom, the water pump has started
to leak a bit.  I suspect the tensioning of the new belts was enough of a side
load to make the seal start to leak.  The car has 75k so it's time to change
it.  My question is this:  I've found Automotion to be the cheapest for a
rebuilt pump $98.00.  Does anyone know the approx. time for this job?  I have
shops quoting me 5 hours to 10 hours.  Since it involves re-tensioning the
belts, I cannot do this one myself and I don't want to get robbed.  Also, does
anyone know of a good independent P-car shop on Long Island, NY?

I also have noticed that my carpeting in the hatch is getting wet all the way
on the drivers' side.  The water seems to predominantly be on the "wing" that
flips up to allow access to the drivers' wheel well.  Any ideas where the leak
can be coming from?  I've checked the drains for the roof.  The drains for the
rear spoiler appear to be clear as well.  Thanks for any ideas.
