Hi Wes,

Good questions as usual. :-)

I have the stock 951S suspension. In the words of my mechanic it is
'reasonably low'. The front is definitely not all the way down. Since I
run at Bridgehampton a lot, he didn't want me bottoming out all the
time. And with the right line I don't. He lowered the rear substantially
(a bit over an inch I believe - remember we get our 944s with the rear
in the air to meet bumper height laws) and then use the front adjustment
to primarily corner balance. I also drive the car on the streets of NYC
so getting it too low is probably not a good idea.

What you are looking for is _any_ play in the balljoint. A good
indicator is the loss or tearing of the rubber boot that apparently
happens at the same time.

As another data point I believe Kevin Gross's 944S was a bit lower than
stock with stiffer springs. (Perhaps he can chime in on this.) He was
lucky (or prepared) enough to have spare a-arms with him. He went to
Fabcars after his incident. Since he is happy with them on his car I
decided to take the plunge.

Paul
