John,
      You may want to check with the Porsche dealer before you have your
mechanic do the work. It sounds like your fuel return line that is being
replaced. There was a campaign by Porsche (CMPG28601) to replace fuel
return line hoses on 944s. It was issued in June of 1986 so I don't know if
your car is covered. However, It can't hurt to ask. Also, there was a
recall (29001) to replace the short piece of hose at the fuel rail that was
issued in April of 1990. Both of these have been the cause of engine fires
on 944s. A customer at one of the shops I did business with had an engine
fire in the 1992.  At that time very few people knew about either of the
recalls. The shop recommended he contact Porsche to see if there was a
recall but, he elected not to. He decided to go ahead and have them do all
the repairs. After several months of repair and $5000, he found out that
Porsche would have done all the repairs for nothing.  He never recouped any
of the money.

Hope this helps,
Clark Fletcher

 the insert holes in the glovebox itself (these keeps hangers from
 falling down, and thus glove cover) are also thorn off. 
 I am surprised how fragile these things are on a PORSCHE!
 
 Is there any fix to these problems (without replacing the whole
 glovebox and/or dashboard)? >>

Here's a post by Joe Martens from about a year ago:
when the second plastic clip broke in my '86 944 I looked long and hard at
the design and decided I could do better. This was also after the shock
dealer price in Oz of over $1000.00 for a complete door with not necessarily
the same colour.
I got a small sheet of 1/32" flat steel, cut it out in the shape of a hook
and then bent the end to screw into the two small (philips head screw)
retained holes above and below the slot and just twisted the "in dash" end
to suit. Works a charm and you only need one and some black matt paint
finishes the job.

This is a rough stick drawing off the real thing. I tried to scan it with
little success if you have one hook intact then draw this and reproduce on
paper. I have it available as a Bitmap image, so ask if you need!
You can remove the inner felt lid lining with about a dosen philips head
countersunk screws and then trim the broken plastic hook until flush with
the rest of the lid. 
Next bend your hook's base and drill two holes for the just removed
countersunk screws.
Feed the new hook through the felt lining and screw the lining back through
the new metal hook. I know it all sounds like broken English which it is,
but for a little labour and patience you can repair the dreaded broken glove
box lid catch.
