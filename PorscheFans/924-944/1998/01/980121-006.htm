Sorry about the note yesterday regarding the virus.  Looks as though so=
me
people here at work got the better of me.  With the level of  computer
understanding that I have, it is such a hard thing for someone to do.

Anyone had experience with Powerhaus?  Is what is listed in their liter=
ature
believable?  What would the difference be between the K-27 and the K-27=
DR?
Would a Bosch 3 bar fuel pressure be required like Powerhaus claims?  D=
oes
Powerhaus purchase their Turbo's from Turbo Engineering Corp in Colorad=
o?
Finally, what would the $50.00 kit be that raises the boost from .8 bar=
 to 1.0
bar?  Since the car is stored for the winter, it is time to make a few =
changes
to the car.

Quite a few people have the same questions I think.

Powerhaus On-Line info

1. K-27 Turbocharger Conversion. All 1986-1988 944's came with a K-26-#=
6 turbo,
and the S models came equipped
with a K-26-#8. The different numbers correspond to the size of the exh=
aust
housing. The larger S housing and hotter
computer chips were the only major differences between the engines, and=
 while
the S model had a little more horsepower, the
turbo also tended to come on later (more lag).

For most applications, we prefer to use the smaller #6 housing, as this=
 allows
greater throttle response. Coupled with the K-27
compressor unit, you have a gain of 35hp. For easier installation, our =
kit
includes a new $50 temperature sensor (the old one
no longer fits) for the turbo's supplemental water pump, free with the =
purchase
of the K-27 kit. Also included is a turbo inlet
adapter for the larger K-27, as well as other custom installation piece=
s only
available from PowerHaus.

                                                                       =
 Price:
$1195.00 / Exchange

1a. K-27-DR Turbocharger. We also offer a special "hot rod" version of =
our 944
K-27 which has lower inertia times (spins
up faster and sooner) for drivers seeking extra acceleration. Also give=
s
approximately 7 more horsepower in the upper rpm's.

                                                                       =
 Price:
$1295.00 / Exchange

In addition, we have kits to raise your boost level from 0.8bar to 1.0b=
ar for
an additional 20hp for $50. We do not
recommend higher boost pressures as you risk blowing your head gasket. =
We have
special stainless steel wide fire ring head
gaskets available for the 944 Turbos. The price for this gasket is $95.=
 These
are a recommended upgrade to all OEM head
gaskets (including 944 Turbo S).

Thanks to all.
