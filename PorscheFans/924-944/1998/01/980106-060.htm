Jim Pasha writes in the Feb' Excellence and PorscheFans should listen,
"Injectors get clogged with deposits over time.  Cleaning will help, but
.... buy new ones."

Since Walt at Perfection Plus Porsche Parts here in Little Rock worked so
hard finding all the restoration parts for my project car I promised him
I'd advertise the great deal he has right now on early 944 fuel injectors,
part #944-606-110-01 for $29.95 each!  His phone # is (888)565-1944.  Tell
him John told you about it on the internet and maybe he'll hurry up with my
head porting and multi-angle valve job *wink*

He rigged up an injector tester and showed me the spray patterns from my 13
year old injectors as compared to a new one, was like comparing drool to a
sneeze!
