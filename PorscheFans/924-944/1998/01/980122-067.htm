Hi,

I'd like to upgrade the standard sound system in my 1990 S2.  I have a
high quality CD head unit, but the stock speakers *suck* and they are =
only
very small 4x6s.

What have others done to upgrade their systems?  I'd like to install a
high quality amp and speakers, but don't know what will fit.  I've =
thought
about trying to find a pair of turbo S (i.e., 10-speaker stereo) black
door panels and probably rear quarters too.  I'd throw the factory
speakers away and install something much better, like the Diamond
Motorsports my son installed.  One question I have is:  does the late
model S2 come equipped from the factory so that the hi-fi sound system
(a.k.a., 10-speaker optional stereo) can be installed under the rear
quarter panels without modification, or is my car only equipped with
cutouts in the metal that accept the small 4x6 speakers?  I'd really like
those 6-1/2s back there :-)

=46or amps.  Where do people mount them?  Most decent 4-channel amps are =
too
big to fit in the left rear cubby-hole.  I'd like something in the 4x50 =
or
4x75W variety.  I may have to go with two 2-channel amps and stack them,
but I'd rather not.

Any advice would be appreciated.
