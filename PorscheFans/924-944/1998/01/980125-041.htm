if the ring&pinion is broken will the car still engage the gears and 
move at all.....you see my car has been sitting forever because i 
havent had time to repair it between school and girlfriend V3.0  well 
today i got back in it for kicks started it like usual (every day 
like clokcwork pissed off the neigbors) however i heard something 
today i havent heard before...there is an odd rattling noise coming 
from the underside...you see when the R&P broke (if that is what it 
is, soon to know for sure) i was in the middle of a very hard one two 
shift...anyhow i am wondering if maybe i didnt break the shift 
rod.....the car will still go into gear and move it just doesnt seem 
to get all the way in gear sometimes...however it did move forward 
10Ft and back about 20..without any sign on noise whatsoever...well 
where is that one techy who has the answer!!
