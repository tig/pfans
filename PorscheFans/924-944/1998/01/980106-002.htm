Hi Porsche Fans,
	In response to Thore's Email ref. a 1980 924S.

I have also seen an '81 924 Lux advertised, badged (and priced) as a
924S, the used car dealer selling it was also ignorant of the fact that
it was not what it seemed, until I pointed it out - he consequently
dropped the price accordingly.

All 924S' have 5 bolt wheels, and the absolute giveaway is the bunch of
bananas under the bonnet (hood) that decry a 944 engine (albeit detuned
until '89 ish), as standard.  Besides, the 924S was not launched 'till
'86.

The moral of these stories (I hope that I am preeching to the
converted), is to ALWAYS check what you are buying.  If you are not
sure, check with an expert.

As a followup to Richard Lintin's question about leaded 4 * here in the
UK, there are two articles in PCGB Porsche Post concerning this very
subject (Autumn and Winter '97 [current edition]).  If you cannot get
hold of them, I could try and get them scanned, or sent to you.

Regards,


Rob Holmes
