Ron,

Rather than sort through this item by item, let me see if I can tell you
what the fuel system needs to start reliably when cold and warm . . .=20

(Before I start, let me also state that one MUST have a CIS pressure
gauge to accurately diagnose what is going on.    With a CIS system,
accurate fuel pressure is EVERYthing.)

When the engine is cold, you have to have the cold start injector spraying
fuel into the plenum, which requires a functioning thermoswitch and a good
cold start injector AND the circuitry TO them.   You must also have a warmup
regulator that is accurately metering fuel system control pressure so that=
 you
start out with a richer mixture.   It also has an electrical circuit which=
 is in
series with the auxiliary air valve whose function is to give you a faster=
 idle
during warmup.   (Since you are getting a steady 900 rpm, one might want to
verify voltage to both of these components before going further).

For cold starts, it really doesn't matter if the system pressure bleeds down
to nothing overnight, since it only takes a couple of seconds of pump=
 operation
to get to the 25 psi the injectors need to start functioning.   =20

For WARM starts, however, a system that does not retain about 1.5 bar of
pressure may be very difficult to start because residual engine heat may
vaporize unpressurized fuel, and the injectors cannot spray vaporized fuel,
a condition called vapor lock.   Loss of system pressure can be caused by
a bad fuel pump check valve or fuel accumulator (about equal frequency of
failure), or internal leaks most anywhere in the system).    Also, the=
 warmup
 regulator should not lower control pressure or you will possibly start very
rich
 and drown the spark plugs.

For ANY start, you must have NO air leaks anywhere downstream of the
air flow meter.   If you do, starting will be very hard, and idling may be=
 real
crappy.

So, taking into account what I have said -- which I think is generally=
 accurate,
though perhaps not complete -- and what you have said, you might have a=20
marginal vapor lock problem aggravated by a problem with the circuit to the
warmup regulator and the auxiliary air valve.   Depending on their history,
924s may develop multiple problems, neither of which is incapacitating by=20
itself, but togther will really sideline you and which will require some=
 canny
troubleshooting.=20

And, of course, the first sentence of any Bosch manual will tell you that
everything else must be in perfect order before you blame the fuel system.

Best of luck.

Dave

       I am about to purchase a 944 or its hybrid, the 951. I was interested
in how much difference there are in the cars, whether the extra horsepower
from the turbo is worth the significant difference in prices (approximately
$4,000.00).  What separates the two otherwise?  Basically I am looking at a
'86 951 with 92000 miles on it in excellent condition for $8500.00 or a 85.5
944 also in excellent condition for $5,700.00.  Which seems to be most worth
my money?  How much extra stress and maintanence is a turbo on an engine?  Are
there any other things "beefed-up" in the 951 over the 944?  Can I expect more
colstly and more frequent repairs?  Thanks for your help.  My email address is
