	Hi guys, I went by my mechanic this morning to have him check a belt
that
	was noisy, and while we were looking under the hood, I noticed a
fuel leak
	from the main fuel line, and it was dripping right onto the intake
manifold
	and spark plugs. I guess I'm lucky that my car didn't burn up. I'm
	wondering if the price for the repair is fair. He quoted 3 hrs.
labor cause
	the line goes all the way to the back, and about 220 bucks for the
line and
	couplers. 
	Does that sound right to our resident experts?
	Also, why do porsche hoses cost so damn much. A hose is a hose, or
is it.
	Is it all markup or are the hoses that special?
	Oh well, there goes my swaybar money.
