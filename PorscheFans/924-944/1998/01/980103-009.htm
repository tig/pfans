On Sat, 3 Jan 1998 10:54:19 -0800, "Ken Kasik" <auskck@email.msn.com> so
eloquently stated:

>Are you looking for a 951 and can't find one with the right price.
>Please consider this from your brother on the 928 page.

Why are you campaigning for 944 owners to buy 928s?  Trying to keep the
prices from going further down the tubes?

>Prices are down on 928's it time to buy

Uh, there is a reason prices are down... people aren't buying 928s =
because
they don't want to get stuck with huge repair bills!  If you think it's
hard finding a good solid 951, it is even harder finding a good solid 928
because the vast majority are trash.  I've looked at many in the Seattle
area.  Just drove an '87 S4 5-speed the other day.  The dealer claimed it
was the cleanest they'd seen (gee, where have I heard that before?) and
that most 928s need $5,000 worth of repairs before they can sell them.

With prices as low as they are, people who would not normally be able to
afford a 928 suddenly decide this is the car for them... until they get a
huge repair bill and they dump the car to the next unsuspecting owner or
just let it deteriorate more.

>Answer, check out the 928 32v 4 cam 1985-1995 288-345 HP stock.

With the low prices, it makes no sense to consider any 928 prior to the
'87 S4 unless you are looking for a bargain priced car.

>Maintence costs for the 928 are no different then the 944 IE; water =
pump,
>timing belts etc etc.

The potential for huge expenditures is quite high with the normal used =
928
because most have not been maintained very well, and when things break,
they cost a lot to fix, much more than a 944.

I'm not saying all 928s are bad.  Those cars that are properly maintained
can be very reliable and quite enjoyable.  The 928 is one of the best =
ever
(if not the best) GT cars made, but it never caught on like it was
envisioned.  Too bad.

Can anyone share with me the "factory" ride height for front and rear,
measuring something besides the bumper?  The technical specifications booklet
gives bumper heights but I find it very difficult to measure.

I'm also interested in hearing from some of you who've lowered the front and
rear.  Measurements from the ground to the crossmember bolts in front, and
wheelarch or shockmount in rear would be great!

Any handy dandy tricks for establishing 1 degree rake?

I'll have the car corner-balanced before any track use, but I'd like to get
the initial height set-up myself.

Thanks,
Jeff Fortenbery
