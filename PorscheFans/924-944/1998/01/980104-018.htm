When my old battery had a cell die, I simply went down to Pep Boys and
asked for a battery for a 1984 Porsche 944, and they got me one off the
shelf. About $60 or so, sealed, maintenance free. The only problem was
that the terminals were slightly larger than they should be, so the
cables required a slight amount of force in attaching them.

I've had surprisingly good luck with buying "generic parts" - brake
pads, battery, filters, lights, etc. at Pep  Boys. All my other "little
bits" come from two import parts houses here in Santa Barbara, and odd
stuff comes from the Porsche, VW, or Audi dealer, or possibly mail
order.

Alex.
'84 944, currently in need of a brown window switch and a steering
wheel.

Hello P-Fans

	Have you check/replaced the DME relay? Also the factory molex
 connectors located by the brake booster, become brittle and sometimes
have loose connections at times. Give the molex block a good tug while 
the engine is running, if the engine cuts out you have found the problem! 

			Good Luck, DavidJalai@aol.com

Have an '86 944 garaged since new.  New engine by Porsche 20k ago.
Problem is this.
After driving about an hour, particularly if in traffic it just dies.
Just cranks, have never gotten under the hood to see if it has a spark.
Always alone when it happens.  Then after 15 to 20 minutes starts up no
problem.  Like a vapor lock or something.  Is there a fuel filter that
has to be changed?  Or do you think its an electrical problem.  Brought
to Porsche and they can find no problem!  They think its a great car,
(but of course don't want to give me much on a trade-in!). Cherry guards
red w/blk leather a great driver when running. Help............
