From my experience (not with a 944 but a Shelby GT350) the oil temp is =
much more load dependent than the water temp. A hard lap vs an easy lap =
could result in a 30 degree oil temp difference with the same water temp =
reading. When street driving you could watch the oil temp rise quite =
quickly after the right foot was held down. So to answer your question I =
don't think there is a linear relationship between the two. If you water =
temp is up and stabilized you should be okay oil temp wise. I would be =
more worried about the oil temp at engine shut down!!
