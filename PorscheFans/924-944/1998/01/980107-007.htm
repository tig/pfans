Lenny,
      I had to get the list off of archive today and your e-mail address
wasn't obvious from the archive. So, I had to post this to the list.
     Checking the orientation of the spark plug gap in relation to the
valves is referred to as "indexing the plugs." There has been a lot of
discussion over the years about how effective indexing is. Here's some
information about indexing from an NGK FAQ.

What is "indexing" and how much more power will I get?

Indexing refers to an old racer's trick whereby the spark plugs are
installed so that the ground
electrode is oriented to face the intake valve (usually) in an effort to
"open up" the spark to the
incoming air/fuel charge. This is accomplished by placing a washer
underneath the spark plug's
shoulder area (of a specified thickness) so that after properly torquing
the spark plug, the
electrode would be pointed in the desired direction, usually towards the
incoming air/fuel charge
from the intake valve.

Some racers have discovered that certain engine configurations made more
power with the spark
plug pointed away from the air fuel mixture.

It is important to note that any power increase will be small, typically
1-2% of total engine
output, and the proper indexing orientation can only be discovered after
extensive engine dyno
testing.

Indexing is a waste of time for racers that do not have the training or the
 dyno facilities to
document the results of their efforts. However, professional race teams
racing in classes that
have strict engine specifications can gain a slight edge over their
competitors when spark plugs
are indexed for optimum performance, provided they have performed adequate
dyno testing.

Hope this is helpful,
Clark Fletcher
