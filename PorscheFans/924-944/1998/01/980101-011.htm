Hi Pfans

It's been a while since my last post.  I've been prompted to post to seek
the list's advice on the clutch pedal operation on my 86 951.  A couple of
weeks ago there was a 'snap' sound from the clutch pedal (fully depressed at
the time).  My first thought was 'uh oh - something's broken', but the
clutch continued to work OK.  There was a noise from the pedal area when the
pedal was about halfway depressed, but that has gone now, and the clutch now
seems to be noticeably harder to depress all the way, with more force needed
at the full extent of travel.

I've had a look around the pedal pivot and return spring, and can't see
anything amiss.  Could it be the master cylinder?  Do these symptoms ring a
bell with anyone?

TIA
