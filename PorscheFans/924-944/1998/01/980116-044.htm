Mike, as you may have already read (H.C. Fletcher's post) there are
apparently many variations on the sun roof mechanisms.  I can only give you
specifics on the one I have described in previous posts.  Based on Mr.
Fletcher's recent post, it would seem unlikely that your 86 Turbo has the
same set up as my early 85.  However, Here are a few suggestions:  As for
"can the roof be locked closed?"; I don't think so if the problem is
stripped gears in the 'transmission' box.  The friction within the cable
drive assembly will probably keep the roof from opening at speed.  When one
of my lift arm cables broke (at the lift arm attachement), I began to
notice that that corner of the roof would lift up a bit (whistling noise). 
It was clear that only one lift arm was holding the roof down.  As for
disassembly, It's pretty straightforward, the interior trim pieces must
come off first to gain access.  I would then begin by opening the lift arm
boxes and the 'transmission' box (at the center of the car where all of the
cables meet).  I think these are the most likely places to find problems. 
I bought a used part from Kempton Bros. (Tampa, FL) to repair mine.  As
long as you can give them a detailed description of the part(s) you need,
they seem knowledgeable enough to get the right bits.  If your problem
seems to be electrical then it will probably be more difficult to diagnose.
