I test drove a 951 which my girlfriend is looking at.  The car is a 250K
car with 10K on a rebuilt engine.  The car is in awesome condition for the
miles, but I have a concern that it was not properly boosting.  It would
get to ~1.2 on the gauge.  Is this what a bone stock 951 is supposed to
boost to, or would this support that there is a leaky line.  I need to find
this out to see if we even want to consider looking at this car any more,
or investing in a mechanics inspection.  Also, what would this car be
worth?  It has been repainted (white), and obviously has had the seats
re-covered in leather (they are much nicer than my 951 seats were bfore I
sold them.)  The dash is fairly badly cracked, and there is one ding in
front of the hood (between the lights.)  The ownser is asking $8500 obo.
So what is this car worth?  $6k?
