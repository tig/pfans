I have a '87 951 with a pretty decent sized oil leak.  If the car sits
overnight, there is a small puddle of oil on the floor of the garage the
next morning.  I powerwashed the underside and the leak appears to be
coming from where the oil pan meets the block.  I was planning on using a
ton of RTV blue to fix the old seal with but when I jacked up the vehicle,
it looks like I have to pull alot of things to get the oil pan off.  Has
anyone pulled one off, and if so, could you let me know what has to be
done to do this.  My 7 darn factory manuals make no reference to this.  It
looks like to me that the support that the A arms connect to has to be
removed along with the exhaust.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks,
Andrew
