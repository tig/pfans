Howdy,

I picked the car up from the shop on Friday evening.  So far, the shop has
done new CV joints and an oil change.  Control arms we are waiting on until
the warranty company decides how much they are paying.

One thing I noticed with the new CV joints was how smooth the car felt.
But, when I got it home, I realised that the car was sitting about 1/2 - 3/4"
higher than normal (shocks taking that much time to settle?).  The car
actually
felt quite floaty and not comfortable.  Under hard acceleration, there was
no vibration felt.  As Saturday wore on, the car's rear suspension finally
settled back down to its correct level and about 10% of the vibration is
back.  This to me is actually good because it feels more stuck to the road.

I'm still not 100% convinced that all of the vibration was coming from
the joints, I'll still stand by my bump-stop theory, but David J. was
right that a large amount of the vibration was coming from the CV joints.
So, all you dudes with the vibration on hard acceleration, flip those
joints!

The next item, once again from David J's emails and other smart guys,
was replacing the air-cutoff valve or compressor bypass valve as other
car companies call it with the new updated 993 part.  My old valve was
dead, wouldn't open when tested under vacuum and I think it was leaking
a bit too (about 1psi worth).  Put the new valve on and it opens nice
and wide under vacuum and seems to hold the boost better (of course).
The off idle response is better and the car gets back onto boost better
after shifting.  The cost price for the valve was C$35, I paid C$44 since
the shop has to make a profit, etc.  I think it's well worth the money
to just replace the junk plastic valves with the new 993 metal re-inforced
valve.

It's been VERY cold here lately.  I used to hate it when Americans made
jokes about Canadians living in igloos, but I think that wouldn't be too
far from the truth this year.  In B.C., we are about 5-7C below normal
levels.  Yesterday, it was -9C outside my home!  The car is a real screamer
in this weather, but it takes forever for the oil to heat up.  Seat heaters
are a nice bonus during these times.

At these low temps, I can here things dislodging in my rear panels.  I
think the glue or whatever they used to stick wires and whatnot to the
inside walls has come loose with the cold weather.  Rear hatch is making
all sorts of noises as the rubber seals turn to ice :)

Have you ever come to your car and you have to put all your weight into
pulling the frozen shut door open!

I would tell you about the story of me washing my car in -1C temps and
getting stuck to the ground, but then you would never respect me anymore :)
