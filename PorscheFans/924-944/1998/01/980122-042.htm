Steve Hubbard orignially mentioned that there would be a $10 'cover' for
each entry into the Daytona infield and he recommended telling Bill
France our displeasure. Then he wrote:

<<Had a little joy today from the Daytona Corp.  Seems like they can't
change their policies just now, but promised they would look at it for
the future.  What they did say, and it will work for me, is that if one
buys one (1) four day ticket ($70), it will allow one into the infield,
grandstand, and paddock(as you had hoped Tom) for the duration (all four
days). One can come and go with the car, as one wishes.  The pass can be
passed on to children who want to go to the hotel, or older folks who
want to pass out more comfortably than at the track, etc.  They even
allowed me to exchange one of my tickets (the two day $35 variety, which
has no parking authorized) for the more expensive one.

Hope this helps some of you who will be going....>>

Hi Steve,

I think I know why they came up with the $10 per pass rule. The locals
like to cruise all night long coming and going, coming and going. For
them the event is an all night party. Most could care less about the
race. I imagine Bill France or the USRRC find the whole thing somehow
objectionable. But they are literally screwing themselves because the
local kids account for 99% of the attendees.
