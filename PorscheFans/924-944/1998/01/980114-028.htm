Hi, Roxanne,

I had the same symptoms on my passenger door.  It turned out to be the
little plastic socket that fits onto the little metal ball near the lock
mechanism.  There's a clasp that is suppose to tighten the socket around
the ball after they have been snapped together and the clasp on mine had
given up the ghost.  I removed the plastic socket and cut off the
clasp.  I then drilled a very small hole through both sides of the end
of the socket where the clasp was and inserted a wire through the hole. 
Twisting the wire ends together tightened up the socket.  Getting the
socket back onto the ball was a bit difficult, but it's not coming back
off now unless the wire breaks (I also put some grease on the wire to
help prevent rust).  If this is your problem and you don't want to buy
new sockets, you may want to try this.
