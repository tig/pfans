I don't know where you auto-x, but first gear? I can't wait to get out of it!
Last event here was a one minute course and I was wound at 5500 rpm in 2nd down
the straightaway and seriously contemplating 3rd.

The right gear is the one that gets you in the appropriate part of the torque curve.
I like to be rolling it on at 3500 or better coming out of the turns.


BTW, I'd be interested in hearing some techniques on threshold braking that don't involve
flat-spotting my tires. They already have a low speed disco beat from my 55 mph slide.
