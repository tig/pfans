Doug and pfolks,
After reading your post yesterday I got curious (not always a good thing)=
.. I removed only the forward sensor because I dont have a universal exten=
sion. Well in the process I dropped the bolt onto the top of the motor =
and it disappeared. Does anyone have a spare they would care to donate, =
seriously? BTW, mine had a small ring of fine shavings. I cleaned them =
off  No difference in performance. Guess now I'll have to go back and che=
ck the electrical specs ( I'm itchin' to break something, huh?).
