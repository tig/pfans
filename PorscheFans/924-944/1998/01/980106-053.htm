Gents,

The 1979 Sebring M471 option was for four-wheel disc brakes. The wheels
were 6" X 15" with 205/60 H15 tires, usually Pirelli P6s. The option
added $1400 to the price of a 924. The option was offered MY1979 to
MY1982 in the US. My 1981 924 has this option. 

The same 5-bolt wheels were made standard for the MY 1981-82 US 924
Turbo, all ROW markets had these wheels as standard. 16" X 6" forged
wheels were optional in all markets with the M471 option, front and read
swaybars and mandantory four-wheel disc brakes. The standard 924 M471
wheels were the cast spider-web type ATS cast wheels, 5-bolt versions of
the 4-bolt normally offered.

The rear wheels also used a 19mm spacer to improve handling, this
induced understeer. The 4-bolt application did not use a soacer, though
the factory offered one and recommended it to improve handling.
