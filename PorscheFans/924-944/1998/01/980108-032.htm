Howdy, 

I found a few emails in my inbox this morning asking why the battery voltage
reads high on startup and then lower later on.  I had no idea, but Kevin B.
had the response.  I didn't think he would mind me posting to the list
rather than reply to each person:

Makes sense to me!  

To finally get all the damn air out of the cooling system, I had to jack
the front end up, let the car cool, open the bleeder screw, fire the
car up again, wait for coolant to come out of the bleeder in continious
fashion and then shut bleeder.  Bring car back down and enjoy hot air
at idle.  What a pain!  Thanks to Clark Archer and Doug D. for the help
in getting all the air out.  Hopefully there isn't a stupid pinhole leak
somewhere sucking air in as the car cools!

Farzaan.
