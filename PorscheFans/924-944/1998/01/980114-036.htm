Just wanted to add a note here that might save someone money.  If you have
the TS brakes on your 951, running a track pad at an auto-x is a recipe for
disaster.  At our last Regional event last year, both Paul and I ran our
Porterfield R4-S pads, the ambient temps were around 15C which is quite
normal here.  In the first corner, both Paul and I plowed way off the apex
because we couldn't stop enough.  We dragged the brakes up and down the pit
lane, but still couldn't get enough heat into them.  The only part of the
run that had really good brakes was coming into the stop box :)

The higher temp pads seem to work fine on the normal 951 brakes.  I think
Bill Buetow runs a Porterfield R4-S or R4 pad on his S2, but I think his S2
has the normal small calipers and thin rotors.  The unusual thing here is
that the R4-S pad works great on the street with more initial "cold" bite
than the MM and has awesome high temp ability for mild track events and
extreme street driving, but at an auto-x, they just wouldn't get past that
initial cold temp bite until the end of the run.

So far, the Metal Master is the only pad that heats up fast enough and has
enough brakes to make it through an aggressive run in our cooler temps
up north.  *AND* they are dirt cheap :)
