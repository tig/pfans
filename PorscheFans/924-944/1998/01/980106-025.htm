Actually, there was a 1980 924S. The "S" denoted a sports package though,
and was not the 924S we normally think of with its 944 engine. The 1980 924S
had upgraded suspension and various other tidbits, I'm not sure exactly what
was included in the package. As far as I know it was only offered in 1980.
