I am planning on doing the belt change some time in January and was
wondering if anyone had any detailed instructions for this process.  It
seems like I have heard someone mention having written such
instructions.  I have the Haynes manual and the factory manuals already.
I plan on changing all four belts, roller, tensioner etc.  Any other
suggestions on items to change(seals, ets.) while I am in there?  What
about tools necessary to complete the job(besides the P9201)?  Any
information  would be greatly appreciated.
thanks and Happy Holidays
Bart H.

Hey Porschefans,

hope everyones still enjoying all their new toys from the holidays.

i am taking the plunge, investing in an 87 924S , 90k, 2nd owner, all service
records, and most everything works. since our "other" car was t-boned three
weeks ago , were making it a 2 porsche family and calling the junkie (car
wrecker, not drug addict) on what evers left in the driveway :)
so as i enjoy the mental picture of korean steel (?) being turned back into
coke cans ((tm),  for the suits), i am now faced with some brand new
questions.

the few things the 87 does need are brake rotors , probably two, but ill do
all 4, are these straight 944 parts, front and rear? will parts from an 85.5
944 fit right on?
drivers side outer door handle is shot too, part from the 85.5 fit ok here?
do i look for 944 mechanical parts , and 924 body parts, how does it work with
the mixed components?? ofcourse ill need brake pads as well, are there sensors
there?
in any event if anyone can enlighten me (especially on the rotors and door
handle) i'd appreciate it.
thanxs,

eric (ericj001@aol.com)

87-924S (after tommorrow) guards red, early gift for my valintine 
is owning two porsches like having two wives??  :\

In a message dated 98-01-04 14:38:56 EST, you write:

<< I think the problem could be solved by passing
 legislation that forbids _any_ vehicle that blocks visibility from using
 the left lane. Let them poke along behind grandpa in the right lane. ;-)
  >>

But then you'ld have to determine what "blocks visibility".   Personally, I'ld
rather the effort be put towards making it illegal to go under 80 mph in the
left lane.
