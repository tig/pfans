I know this reply is very late, but just wanted to comment--I just
replaced my factory sport Konis with the widely advertised and 50%
cheaper Boge "turbo-gas" shocks.  Although my Konis were shot for a long
time and my memory may be fading, it really seems to me that the Boges
provide a stiffer ride than the Konis (which perhaps were set on
"softest").  It seems to corner flatter, but the ride seems less
controlled (gets unsettled by bumps easier), and unfortunately my ride
height increased a bit.  But considering the cost, I'm happy.
