Sure!

The leak comes from the battery box, the common Porsche failure.  

On the 944 (85.5 on) the drain for the battery box is on the right side
mid way back, it is a dimple in the seam weld to let the water flow out
as the car is moving forward. (On the pre-85.5 it was a large drain in
the firewall which you can find by following the missing paint). 

Anyway this rear drain is small and very easily clogged after the
battery acid and gas have thinned out the metal it starts to leak down
onto (ready for this ) the brain box. Now the brain is mounted so that
the heat from the motor will not make it in fast, so this nice air
chamber allows the water to flow all the way to the rear seat area were
there is no drain, instant lake.

You can solve this one in many ways, but all involve recoating the
battery box with something. Options I have hear are:
1.	fiberglass
2.	The thick plastic they sell to coat tool grips
3.	Epoxy 
4.	Clear table top sealer
5.	Etc..

What ever you do make sure the drain is still open, and if you are in a
good frame of mind, drill out the front drain (remember to put sealer of
the edges you drill through)


Have a good time

	I am a new member and have read that a leak into the passenger
footwell is
	common, but has anyone narrowed down the likely point of
leaking?  I have
	looked and not been able to find the leak if it is from the
windshield or
	other.  There seemes to be an innordinate amout of water
accumulation, even
	in light rains.  This leads me to believe it is being funneled
into the
	cabin by some means.  It is really annoying to the ladies riding
shotgun.  

	Thanks, Mike
