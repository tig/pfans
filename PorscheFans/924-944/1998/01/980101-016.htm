Richard, the 12 point internal sockets are not particular to Porsche.  I
presume they are metric  but unfortunately, I don't see any marking on the
socket other than what appears to be the manufacturer's code number.  It
says "CAL-VAN 116-3" on the socket that fits the C.V. joints.  I bought a
set of them quite a while ago at one of the local 'Tools-Are-Us' type of
places (I think).  You won't find them in the Sears tool dept.  If you are
just going to buy the one socket (other sizes are used elsewhere on the
car), then it wouldn't hurt to bring one of the bolts or a clay impression
of the bolt head with you to be sure you get the right size.

corner.
