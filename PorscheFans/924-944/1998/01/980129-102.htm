If you have been following any of my posts you know I had been running
high boost and thought I blew a head gasket.  I had just got a K-27 DR
turbo from PowerHaus I was planning to install and since the manifold
had to come off for both jobs I thought I would do both at once.  Then I
decided to get the PH Head and Manifold.  I am only a novice mechanic
and am learning as I go.  I have the K-27 installed and am beginning to
remove the head.  I had trouble finding the last bolt on the timing
chain cover and several PorscheFans came to my aid.  Once again I need
help.

After taking the cover off I had trouble finding top dead center.  When
the mark on the Cam Gear  is lined up with the outer mark it seems like
the piston keeps coming up for about 3/4" past the mark.  I am unable to
find the mark though the slot on the bellhousing.  I do not know how
tight the belt should feel and I do not have the special tool.  The belt
seems very loose to me on the slack side.  I can easily turn the water
pulley and can easily turn the belt 90 degrees to either side.  I found
one tooth messed up on the belt and think I may need to replace the belt
also.

When I thought I blew the gasket the car was running with poor power and
making a noise like exaust escaping in the exhaust header area.  The
idle was erratic.  Now I wonder if I may have jumped a tooth or two on
the timing belt.  Is it not possible to retension the belt without the
special tool, at least good enough to drive it a few miles to get the
shop to properly tension it.  With one tooth missing do I definitely
need to replace the belt?  The belt has about 19000 miles on it.

If I could get the head done I would probably let the shop replace the
belt and I have a PH clutch that I want the shop to do anyway.  Any
advice will be appreciated.

On another note I noticed a car for sale in Califoria 89 944T with 22000
miles.  Completely stock except for wheels, weekend driver only and
always garaged, never wrecked for $21,500.  If the car is as described I
know I would love to have it but it is too far away to check on.  It is
advertised in Classified 2000 if anyone is interested.  My wife would
kill me if I bought another one anyway.
