I would like to thank everyone who responded to my request for info on
buying a 968.  I did purchase the one I was looking at.  It is a '93
black six speed with tan leather and 45K miles.  I paid $17250 for it
and it is in really great condition.  The interior looks like it has
never been sat in.

However, the sound system has some problems.  When I turn the volume up
or down there is static in the speakers and the left side speakers
sometimes don't work at all.  My first question is which seems more
likely the stereo itself or the speakers as the problem?  My second
question is should I take the car to the dealer or to a sound shop to
have it looked at?

Thanks for the help!
