Hi Tony,

You might have had a little corrosion on the relay mounting "prongs".  Just
the process of removing and reinstalling the relay might have been enough
to clean them off for the time being.  In the future, you might wish to
check some of the other removable relays from time to time, and you might
also think about keeping some emery cloth or 600 grit wet/dry sandpaper in
your tool/parts box to occasionally clean the connections.
