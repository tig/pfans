Porsche experiment with the PRV V-6 in a 924 was just that - an experiment.
Porsche wanted to develop a new engine that was purely a Porsche engine for
the 944. The goal was to distance the new 944 from the 924. The 924, as we
all know, was never intended to be a Porsche. It was designed by Porsche
for VW-Audi to be their sports coupe. When VW ran into financial trouble
and changed management, the 924 project would have been scrapped if Porsche
had not bought it from VW. The 924, which used VW and Audi parts,  was
never accepted (by most) as a true Porsche.  When Porsche put the PRV V-6
in the 924 as a test platform, it was to determine the feasability of
developing a V-6 of their own to go in the 944.  Porsche never intended to
use the PRV V-6 in the 944. I agree that it doesn't make sense that the
vibration results for the V-6 were not encouraging. In fact, some of the
books I have read indicated that the test results from the PRV V-6 powered
924 were encouraging. This resulted in Porsche considering development of a
V-6  of its own for the 944 (a 928 derivative). We may never know for sure
exactly how Porsche viewed the results of the experimental 924.  However,
what is widely accepted is that a V-6 engine could not have been installed
in the 944 using the existing 924 production line.  Porsche obviously felt
that they could produce a new in-line four that could be competetive with
the V-6s and still keep their production costs within reason by using the
existing 924 production line.
