Brian, 
  Congratulations on your purchase! Your sound system problems shouldn't be 
all that difficult to fix. The static/scratchy sound you hear while adjusting 
the volume control is due to dirty/worn potentiometers. You can clean them by 
spraying a cleaner/protectant into the volume control potentiometers. Radio 
Shack sells a product to do this (contains a solvent to clean away 
dirt&oxidization, and a light mineral oil to reduce wear and oxidization 
during future use). I would suggest you attempt this repair yourself before 
having someone else look at it, no one cares about a car more than the owner.. 
In order to properly apply the cleaner/protectant, you will need to remove the 
radio from the car. This will allow you to remove the cover on the radio, and 
gain better access to the potentiometers. You will want to spray the 
cleaner/protectant into the potentiometers wherever there is a gap in the 
potentiometer housings. While you have the radio out of the car, you might as 
well clean them all. Make sure to rotate the volume, balance,etc.. controls 
throughout their full range many times between several applications of the 
cleaner/protectant to properly clean the surfaces and spread the protective 
oil. If you do not feel comfortable with the above repair, call around until 
you find a shop that sounds like they know what you want done, it really is a 
simple job.

  Your loss of audio on the left side of the car could be due to dirty 
potentiometers, or a loose connection. I would suggest you clean the radio's 
potentiometers and see if the problem goes away. If not, let me know and I can 
help you from there.
