Thanks to everyone who wrote to me regarding my tire situation in 
Germany. Here is a quick rundown of what happened.

Z-rated tires cannot be repaired in Germany. Not at the bases or 
embassy either. It was suggested, though, that you could do it 
yourself at the base auto hobby shop (oh, excuse me... Auto Skills 
Development Center)

I called around and got prices for tires on the economy.  The 
Bridgestone Potenza S-02s were available for 387DM. I called my good 
friend/mechanic who went through his channels and and got them for me 
at a lower price of 375DM.  It is sure cool to have that guy as a 
friend!  He even lets me work on my car in his garage! For free!

Anywho, the price works out to about $220 mounted and balanced -- 
better than the Tire Rack price by quite a bit.  That was pretty much 
the first time I have found a product here that was cheaper on the 
economy as in America. (the second was Riven which was on sale here 
for like 60DM at Saturn)

I called the tire folks at Vogelweh and they had 245/45 ZR16 tires in 
stock for $150, but I got the impression that they were there for a 
while. The guy said Dulop P6000, but I couldn't find that tire on the 
internet.  I figured, what the heck...  if I am spending $150, why 
not $200 and get the snazzy new S-02s.

Verdict:  I like them.  The car feels a bit different, a bit tighter, 
but I am not really expert enough of a driver to say exactly why.  
But $440 well spent.

-Tim
