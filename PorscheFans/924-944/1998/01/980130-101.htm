Joe,

Maybe I should add that my car is a 1988-model (don't know if I mentioned this the first time). I cannot speak for the pre 1986 dash.
But windshield removal to R and R the dash ???????? No way with my car.

About the coolant loss: the radiator for heating up your feet and hands is filled with coolant. That is, if all is well. :-)
If this radiator is leak, coolant will be lost. At first a very small amount. After several months and some 10.000 Km, the loss is more noticeable. You can smell the coolant by the strange, soft-sweet smell
(coolant also tastes sweet). Since there was no sign of coolant loss, there where 2 possibilities: headgasket or interiorheaterradiator. Fortunately, it was the last.

Rudy, 1988 944 nice and warm
