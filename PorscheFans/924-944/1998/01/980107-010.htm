Bill,
     If you pull back the carpet in the front of the passenger side
footwell, you'll find a wooden panel held by four screws. The DME and KLR
control units are mounted to a bracket behind the wooden panel. You will
end up replacing one chip in each control unit. The control units have two
printed circuit boards inside that face each other and are connected on one
end by a permenant ribbon strip. The trick is this. The chips are on the
inside where the boards face each other. You have to separate the boards
(very carefully) to get to the chip. If I remember correctly (it's been a
while), there are several nuts you have to remove to get the boards apart.
Additionally, the top board is mounted on plastic post that are split at
the top. You have to press the split parts of the posts together to release
the top board (I can't remember how many posts there are). Once you release
the top board you can lay the top board over (like opening a clam) to get
to the chip. The chip should have an indentation on one end. Make sure you
keep this orientation when installing the new chip. It is possible to put
them in backwards and if you do it can destroy the chip. As far as
grounding, I don't normally have a problem with static where I am so I
normally don't bother grounding myself. If you have a problem with a lot of
static where you're going to be working, grounding straps are available
from Radio Shack. As far as other modifications, you can check the banjo
bolt by removing it from the turbocharger outlet line going to the
innercooler and looking at the inside. If it is stock, the inside of the
bolt will be completely open. If not, it will have a small orifice threaded
into the end of it. The cycling valve (or AMOL valve) is normally what is
drilled on some of the chip kits. It is underneath the back intake runner
near the #4 plug and has a wiring connector and several lines running to
it. You can't tell if it has been drilled unless you remove it. This is
very difficult with the intake manifold in place. Some of the chip kits do
not drill the cycling valve. Instead, the chips will fail the cycling valve
open and the signal to the wastegate is controlled by a manual throttle
valve installed in the line downstream of the cycling valve (which runs
along the firewall).  If this is the case you may find a small valve
mounted on the firewall or possibly inside the passenger compartment.  You
should be able to look at the wastegate to see if it has had any shims
installed behind the spring. As I said before, its been a while since I've
had the DME and KLR units open so the instructions above may be a little
fuzzy. If you get the brains open and still have questions about how to get
at the chips, e-mail me at my home address (fletch@twave.net).  I have two
sets of spare control units at home and I can walk you through it if you
have any questions. Hope this is helpful.

I think this is the method of boost increase on my car.  Looking at the
wastegate from underneath, it looks like a couple of washers (about 2mm thick
total) have been installed on each of the 4 bolts holding the diaphram to the
wastegate (effectively moving the diaphram housing 2mm further away from the
wastegate housing).  Is this the shim in my wastegate????  If not, how can you
visually identify it?

Thanks,
Bob
