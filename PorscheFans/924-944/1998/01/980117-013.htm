Hi Joe,

Hope that you get a new harness with your O2 sensor!  Sticking pins into wires is an 
automotive No-No.  It leaves a hole that will allow wicking to occur and very quickly 
the entire copper wire core will become green and corroded for several feet in either 
direction.  Since your O2 sensor is down low and exposed to the elements, this will 
definately happen to the wire and I am sure that the O2 readings will become strange 
just because of the hidden corrosion to the wire itself.  Reseal with silicone seal or 
-- even better if you can slide it over the wire's end -- use heat shrink tubing to seal 
your puncture wound in the wire.

For those who want to poo-poo this, here is a simple experiment that will make you a 
believer.  Mix a glass of salt water and stick one end of a 2 foot wire with 
stripped ends into the liquid.  Come back 24-36 hours later and the opposite end (the 
dry end) will be green as grass.
