Hi everyone,

I just purchased a '87 944. Really nice car and I already love it. I have   
a couple of problems though that I was wondering if anyone could shed   
some light on. I am not of technical background but I have a friend who   
is so though this message maybe in laymans terms, answers don't have to   
be.

1. If the car has been started and shut off, it gives me trouble when   
starting again within a short period of time. It starts nicely when it is   
cold, but not when it has been running for even two minutes, shut off and   
then restarted. Also this does not happen all the time but   
intermittently. Somedays there is no problem starting while on others   
there is. Several people have several different theories on this. The car   
uses a lot of gas (17mpg, is this normal?) and thus one person I talked   
with said that it may be flooding due to the mixture bein too rich and   
the spark plug did not have enough power to ignite the fuel mixture.   
Someone said that there was a problem with the DME. Yet another said that   
the alarm system maybe shorting out or something.

2. The key that I have starts the car (sometimes!!) but does not lock the   
doors. It goes into the driver's door and even turns fully and sometimes   
locks the doors on both sides but only 1% of the time. The key does not   
go into the trunk key slot at all. It goes into the other door but does   
not turn. I have been leaving the car unlocked as a result. Which leads   
to another question. Does the car ( 87 944) have an alarm system at all?   
I am trying to figure out if this is a problem with all the locks or just   
the key. Is it worth it calling Porsche directly and getting a key made   
with the serial# of the car?? Seeing that the key only goes into one of   
the three locks, I thought that it was the key that was the problem. Any   
Ideas??

In the digest for jan the 7th I read the 944 problem with the car   
stalling when it was warm. Maybe that might be the answer to my prayers   
but if anyone has any other ideas please share.

Also I want to mention that I am a big fan of Bill Underwood's Porsche   
Home page. You guys should check it out if you guys have access to the   
internet.

Thanks
