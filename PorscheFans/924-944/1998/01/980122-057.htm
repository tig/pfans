There's been some discussion on the startig problems with the 924's.
Here's my personal experience with this anoying problem. I have a 77' 924
with alittle over 100K miles. From the first day I bought it, it's had the
hot starting problem. I have gone and replaced the two fuel accumilators,
the pump, injector seals and yet the problem is still there. 
What my mechanic did was to take off the cold shart injector wire and hook
it upto a manual switch. Now when I push this switsh while cranking the
engine fuel goes to the engine. Just enough to catch the engine and after
that the normal fuel presure kicks in. At this pint the only thig I can
think of is the injectors themselves. If they are leaking after I stop the
car then that cauld be the hot start problem. 
I have had this system for the last year or so and never failed. The only
compromise is the cold starts. You need to press the button when you
cranck the engine in the mornning. I can live with that. 
My advise is if you want a quick solution then do what I did. If you
really want to solve the problem then do a fuel presure test in various
places alonf the fuel line. If your loosing fuel presure after you shut
down the engine then this test will point out where the problem is. 
Good luck. Thats all I can say for now.
If you need more info, write to me.

Hi guys and Rox,
Decided to join the argument over significant/historical
924-944-968 Porsches.
MOST significant would be '78 Lux 924, it broke with tradition.
'79 Euro or '80 USA Turbo....preferably with "everything on it".
Of course the 924 Carrera GT in street trim and the 924 Carrera
GTR that took 6th at Les Mans.
Then, the 944 that took 7th at Les Mans
The 944 S2, the 944 Turbo S, the 968 cabrio, the 968 Turbo
Of course, they can't bring all of these, and I didn't pick
nearly enough racing models, but these are the cars that 
people can DRIVE, and so, relate to.
Jeanette

Hey fellow porsche dudes. I'm new here. I own a 1980 924 turbo. With the
proper amount of care this is going to be THE sleek ride. But for now I have
some cranking problems. I have fire going into dist.  but not coming out. By
the way, I was told when I bought the car that it needed a "brain"-ignition
box. My mech. checked volts coming out and doesn't suspect this. Is there
anyway of checking this? We ruled out ignition switch under dash. I do know I
have a leaking accumulator too , but that shouldn't matter for this ? The car
sat for a year- then we got it started with a different dist.  We fixed what
was wrong with old dist. and refired. But after a 30 min drive to home it has
not started again. We retried the stand-bye dist. but it did not do it.
Sooooo  does this ring a bell for anyone?
