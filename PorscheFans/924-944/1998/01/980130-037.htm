On the other hand, the Ts and NAs do have a few parts in common, so it's
nice to have the broader input.  Besides, we'd lose the bickering between
camps.

I'm setting the baseline of my 'new' 86 944 turbo.  I'd like to determine   
'what condition my condition is in' (can you older members name that   
tune?)  Anyway, what kind of milage are other 86 944T's getting?  Also,   
I've seen threads concerning throwing away the stock air cleaner for   
another.  What filter is best and Will this let the car breathe better,   
filter better, or both.
Also, I'm glad someone else brought up the question on the floor jack   
positioning.  It's been my concern for the past month.
