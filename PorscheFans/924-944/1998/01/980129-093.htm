Since no replies from the list have been forthcoming, I"ll take a stab at
your
query even though I'm purely an amateur at this procedure.

As I understand it, when you push down the clutch pedal inside the car, the
clutch cable pulls the release lever (or "clutch lever" Haynes fig. 6.8) on
the side of the clutch which moves a rod to force the release bearing
against the powerful spring fingers on the clutch pressure plate (see Haynes
fig. 6.1).  Thus pressure is taken off the two-surfaced clutch disc.  The
clutch is now disengaged, allowing the engine to turn free.
When you foot comes off the clutch pedal, the springs in the pressure plate
force the release bearing to trap the clutch disc between the flywheel and
the pressure plate.  The clutch is now engaged.
Hence, your screwdriver is in effect disengaging the clutch for adjustment
of the clutch lever.  (I hope this is right!)
>2)  Turn the outboard lever until the distance between the clutch lever and
>the adjusting bracket is 138 mm.  (Does this mean just turn the lever or

Yes, the levers are the same thing.  (Pretty confusing I admit.)  You loosen
the lever on the shaft  (i.e., the nut on the bolt which applies pressure to
keep the lever from rotating on the shaft) )and then retighten.
>3)  Adjust the cable at the bracket until the distance between the clutch
>lever and adjusting bracket is 138 mm (didn't we just do this?) and the
>pedal free play is 20-25 mm from the top of the pedal.
By adjusting the lever by loosening the nut, turning the lever on the shaft,
and retightening the nut, some play has been introduced into the cable.  You
readjust this play by the nuts at the adjusting bracket.   As I recall, I
went through this process several times before I got it right.  Hopefully
your cable is not too stretched so that the pedal free play will come out
about right.

Yes, 170mm is far too much play. You need to adjust.  I don't believe
anything is wrong with the RHD conversion from what you have written, but I
don't have experience with them.  In place of your 30 mm spacer at the
firewall, the LHD cables have a 150 mm spacer (1.5 cm!)  On the three cables
I have installed, it was standard--presumably to allow for some flex at the
bracket when the cable is under stress and to help prevent wear and binding
between the cable and the cable housing.  Another suggestion:  be sure to
use cable supports in the engine compartment to prevent the cable from
flopping around too much or the cable will begin to bind and wear.

The first time I did the job it was a bit frustrating--I felt I needed a
third hand.  One suggestion is to cut a dowel 138 mm. long by which to
measure the distance between the bracket and the clutch lever (actually the
pivot pin of the cable). The second and third times were much easier, but by
then the job was not so confusing.
I hope these notes help. Let me know if I need to clarify anything.  I'm
posting to the list also in the hope that some of the professional mechanics
will correct any errors I might have made.
