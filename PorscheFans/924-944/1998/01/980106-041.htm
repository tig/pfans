Hello to all from sunny Miami! Just reading from the Performance
Products catalog nr 42A on pg nr 7 you'll see at the bottom center that
they're trying (and I say "trying") to sell you these washers to adjust
the firing aim of the ignition spark kernel. My question is if this is
actually significant to the improvement of the performance of our
beloved German engineered powerplants, why didn't the factory
incorporate this idea into their vehicles? Perhaps it's only a minute
realization of performance or I could be wrong. Any amplification is
requested. Also, if this is actually something significant and a simple
mod to our spark plugs we al can do to increase thrills from our
engines, then which angle should the spark plug face? To make
explanations simple, when I mean which way the spark plug should face, I
mean when yourself is standing on the righthand side of the engine bay
(front of car to your right) looking in onto the cylinder head, I want
to know which side of the electrode (the base of the electrode is welded
to the spark plug head) should be angled? Perhaps in degrees of a circle
would be easy to convey, i.e. 45 deg or 75 deg or 245 deg with the top
of the circle being the intake side of the cylinder head. It'll be
interesting to see what comes up from this question.

To Nick and Tony, it's interesting to note that my '83 944 N/A was
purchased as outfitted with the whole Bosch Motronic System of a '85 to
'89 series. From the DME which is part nr 944.618.121.03 or 0 261 200
076 found on the label to the air flow meter 0 280 202 064 to a number
of other sensors. I found this out during my investigation of why she
wouldn't send any breaking current to the coil during cold starts yet
she'd fire right up once the engine was warm. (To refresh others who
didn't catch my findings, it was the fly wheel sensors that were at
fault. I'd have to put a heat gun to the sensors and then she'll start.)
To my amazement, even though someone went through all of this swapping
out of  the management system, no upgraded chip was found in the DME
module! I thought that was the whole idea of changing to a removable
chip. But since subscribing to this forum, many have argued that there
is no noticeable improvement on "chipping" a normal aspirated engine,
therefore I'm not gonna spend the money on "chipping" my 944.

Chris Franz, I remember when I upgraded to an indash Pioneer CD player,
my cables ran to the rear underneath the door jam moulding on the left
side of the car. I haven't checked the right door jam yet to see what
runs under there but let me know what you find, please. I remember
someone from an earlier digest was asking if there is a speaker
underneath the dash grille. My answer is yes. It is a small 3 1/2" round
speaker mounted into a 6x4 plate. You can access this speaker by gently
prying up, taking turns on all four sides. Otherwise you'd end up
breaking one of the plastic pegs.

Someone else asked about Eurospec pistons. Hmmmmm. Thought I saw them
listed in the Auto Atlanta catalog for 924/944. This is the one with the
black cover with the red 944 and silver 924 pictured. It's listed under
the section titled "rebuild", pg 33.

That was the first thing I did: look for all available catalogs. I have
Auto Atlanta,  Performance Products and Automotion. I know there are
more out there. Just need to find them.
