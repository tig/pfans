Hello everyone:

Just returned from my first look at the prospect. For a change the car was
as it had been represented. It only has two problems that I know of at this
time. I am taking it to Black Forest in Atlanta next week for a
pre-purchase inspection to hopefully uncover any other ones.

The two problems are: rusty battery box (it has a hole about the diameter
of a pencil); and the turn signal does not cancel after a left turn 
(right side cancels fine). I've done the fiberglass battery box repair
before and the results were OK, but because of the way this is mounted, I
thought it would be better to have a new one welded in. Anyone know what
this will cost? The FAQ says $500. That seems like a lot for a relatively
simple procedure. Granted it is in rather tight quarters. Is the turn
signal switch history or can it be repaired? What do they cost? George, any
used ones available?

Thanks to everyone who posted regarding the option codes. Don Istook said
that the 5R code showed that it has LSD & trans oil cooler. He was right! I
verified it this afternoon. I wonder if this particular code is some sort
of an option package. The code for sport seats, & central locking  were not
listed but they are on the car. If I do buy it, I will write PCNA and ask
for the details, and then post them. Hope they don't lose the request
during their move.
Thanks.

Keith

Hey all,

Continuing with this thread on driving techniques, specifically
braking.  I understand the turn in part, the neutral section, and the
fun part where you get back on the gas.  Its amazing how well the rear
of a 951 plants when you have big sticky 275s on the rear.  I also
understand threshold braking...  My question is how to keep the brake
fluid from boiling, or do I have something wrong with my brake system.

I run ATE super blue (flushed and bled regularily), SS lines, have a
cool brake kit installed, and use carbon kevlar pads.  I used to use
PFCs, but they really ate the rotors.  I also tried going back to street
tires for my last DE event to see if I would generate less heat... 
didn’t work, but I had a lot of fun sliding through corners.

Barry, Paul, Nick, Don, everyone driving a 944/951 on the track... How
do you keep your brake pedal from going soft?  Mine seems to fall a
significant distance throughout the run session.  It does come back up
eventually.  I’ve never been without brakes, but heel-to-toeing becomes
rather interesting.
