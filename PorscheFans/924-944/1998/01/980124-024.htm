Well, it was going to happen sooner or later. That tell-tale
knocking when going on and off power was signalling the
inevitable. The rubber section of the clutch was broken and
it was only a matter of time before it broke completely. Now
my '84 944 is permanently in neutral and I guess its time to
get to work.

Which is why I'm hoping I can get help here. I know this is
a common problem with 944's and I'm sure you guys can offer
me some wise words of advice, the most pressing being where
I can find a reasonably good quality, inexpensive clutch and
other parts. I live in the Vancouver, Canada area, and with
the recent bungee-jump of the Canuck dollar (69 cents US), I
don't know if ordering parts from the US would be worth it.
Any advice you might have would be greatly appreciated.

And of course I do plan to give back to
924-944@PorscheFans.com community. Since this is a common
problem and others will need the same advice, I plan to put
the collection of advice and personal experience on a
permanent web page that all can use in the future. I've
already started by re-formatiing and convering Micheal
Kehr's Clutch replacement document into PDF format for
easier printing
(http://www3.bc.sympatico.ca/dominik/944/944-clutch.pdf).

Once again, and words of wisdom (especially ones that will
save me money) would be greatly appreciated.
