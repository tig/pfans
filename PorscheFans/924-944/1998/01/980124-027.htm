Jerry,

Good.  Put that Subaru away this Spring :-)

right

No, I don't think so.  The standard 968 does not have the 951S type
suspension or brakes.  According to the April 1993 Excellence, the M030
has the 11.97" rotors, 32mm thick (ala 928S4), while the standard car has
11.73" x 28mm rotors.  The following changes are highlighted:

=46ront Axle:

Steering knuckles
Wheel hub, to accommodate larger disc
Coil spring, height adjustable and stiffer
Shock - Koni adjustable
Stabilizer - 30mm tubular
Brake disc, perforated
Caliper - 36/44mm pistons vs 36/40 std
Brake pads, hoses and lines are different

Rear Axle:

Vibration damper - Koni with additional spring, torsion bars are normal
Stabilizer - 19mm, manual trans (text says it is 20mm)
Brake disc, perforated
Brake pads

Excellence described the handling as somewhat hair-trigger if you push it
due to the very stiff rear suspension and increased oversteer.  In daily
driving it is very, very neutral however and any tendency to understeer
has been eliminated. "Option M030 makes this 968 the most responsive
Porsche you can buy today.  It reacts quicker to steering input than even
the RS America."

driver.

IMO, it would be far better than the 951S for daily driving.  It goes a
lot faster than it first appears because the power delivery is smoother
than the 951S.  Ha, I even think my S2 is better.  Sure, it's slower, but
the torque is so nice to have that I don't really miss the power of my
son's 951S that much.  The 968 will still go plenty fast to get you into
trouble.

>Please no one take offense but the thrust of the Turbo S is unique.

Yes, it is.  Kind of like a shot of adrenalin.  But in order to get it =
you
end up going so fast, even in the lower gears, that in normal driving you
rarely get a chance to push it.  For the track, the 951S is a winner, and
I will admit that if someone wanted to trade me for my S2 I probably =
would
just to get the M030, but after putting 1500 miles on my new car in
_normal_ driving conditions, I find it more fun on a daily basis than my
son's 951S.

>Also does anyone have a feel for prices?

There was an M030, 1993 car in Autoweek some time ago for around $25K.
These cars are very rare, but prices are still going down.

> Of course the M30 is red and has 6000 miles

Grab it if you can get the price down to something reasonable!  Then =
drive
it out to Monterey for the Historic Races so we can all see it.

Have fun!

Kevin,

Just a theory and maybe I'm being too simplistic but the car is so stable and
solid feeling that it's possible people break the rear end loose because they
just go into a corner too "hot" and then back off too late. I know that I will
enter a corner much faster in the 944 than any other car that I own and the
car is so solid that it really doesn't feel like I'm going as fast as I really
am.  The car easily gives you a feeling of over-confidence if you're not
careful.

<< My theory is that the metal shavings lessened the clearance between 
 the sensor and the flywheel.  The engine heat caused the flywheel 
 to expand, which made a marginal clearance even smaller, thus causing 
 faulty sensor operation. >>

Wow, these things just keep getting more and more complicated.  Whatever
happened to the old days when you could set your points to the thickness of a
matchbook cover!!!!!
