I am having trouble unlocking the driver side door.  The key does not
always activate the power door locks.  As I turn the key it does not
activate the power door locks but rather it unlocks the door manually. 
 I have to jiggle the key in the lock and hope that it will unlock
using the power door locks.  Unlocking the door manually will not
deactivate the factory alarm.  Anybody have any ideas about what's
wrong?  I'm tired of jiggling the key and unlocking the doors from the
passenger side.

Also, does anyone have any experience with chips for a '89 951?  What
brands would you recommend?  Do all of the chip kits require you to
shim the wastegate?  Does anyone recommend a mass flow kit?

Thank you.

Stanley Chang

Subject: Water pump checking

> 1.  Water pump replacement.  I am not certain how old/miles the existing
> pump has.  I have put about 30K on it.  Is there a way to test(eyeball
> it) to determine condition?  Should I just change both the pump and > the
stat while I am in there?

I asked the same question of my mechanic when I had mine apart last
month.  He said grab the belt driven pulley and try like hell to move it
(up/down/left/right).  If there is ANY play WHATSOEVER in that bearing,
replace the pump.  Mine had some play, the new one did not...

Hello Bill

	Your mechanic is correct. Any play - and replace that water pump. Same thing
goes for replacing the belt pulleys and tensioners - replace every 30K w/new
belts! Any play in between service intervals you should replace them then and
now. 

				Good Luck, Davidjalai@aol.com
