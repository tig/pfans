Menelaos Karamichalis responds:

<<I am not a racer, but I used to be a physics major (actually got the
BA) 
and this makes a lot of sense. In a perfect car, this would not happen. 
In real life, the abrupt brake release does not give time for the weight
to transfer to the rear.  A complete analysis would probably involve
studying how the forces change on the front tires as they go from both
braking and steering to only steering.  There is a finite amount of
traction available and when some is freed up from braking it goes
towards
traction.  Suddenly the front wheels stop drifting, grab on to the road
while the rear end is still light and has little traction, hence
oversteer.>>

Hi Menelaos,

That is bang-on. The purpose of trail braking is to induce oversteer.
Application of the brake while turning will cause the rear tires to be
overstressed to the point where they are losing some adhesion, which is
what you want. Anything abrupt at this stage will cause the rears to
slide even more causing more oversteer. It is the opposite case of the
911 plague - trailing throttle oversteer.
