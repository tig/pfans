Ken,
I thought that the 944 DME carried out the cold-running fuel
enrichment by widening the pulse width of the fuel injector's
"on time".  Is that not correct?  Also, are you certain that
the fuel pressure is boosted by a thermal vaccum switch?  In
Charles Probst's book, he says that Pulsed FI systems (like
Motronic) maintain a constant relative fuel pressure (the 
difference between manifold and fuel rail pressure).

Farzan and other fellow P-fans,
I am also interested in the updated 993 cutoff valve for my 86' 951. What are
the performance advantages over the original valve? Is it a modification worth
doing or is it better to wait until the original valve goes bad? 
Farzan, thanks for all your input to the list, I really look forward to your
contributions.
TIA,

Colin,
I just installed one last night.  I haven't gotten a chance to test for
changes because it's raining today (hard to diagnose boost when the road's
wet!)  The old valve leaked air through it, the new one doesn't (when not
installed in the car).  I have not tested the function w/ vacuum to the line
as Farzaan did.  I think for the cost this is a good item to change just to
make sure it doesn't cause headaches in the future.
