Hello fellow 944 fans,
  I was just curious to see if anyone is planning on going to the ROLEX 24 
at Daytona this Saturday? This will be my first trip back in 2 years (...
last year was spoiled by an EX-wife that liked to spend too much money. Not 
this time!!) This will also be my first year driving my OWN PORSCHE to the 
event to show I really am a fan of the cars!! Obviously, I can't wait!! The 
weather is going to be great, and so should the field. There are a lot of 
entries from Italy, but they have a bad habit of breaking. Not PORSCHE!! 
Lets just hope the political "crap" with PSR...or is it SCCA "?" does'nt 
wreck the event. They (Evans, Panoz, etc.) need to be slapped in my opinion. 
Does anyone remember the nice folks from IMSA? There were so many years with 
good events back in the 80's and early 90's. Ho-Hum, I guess nice things 
must always come to an end. 

   See Ya There!!
