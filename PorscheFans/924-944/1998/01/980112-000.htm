All German List members,

Over the weekend I ran over some small object that punctured my tire. 
My initial assumption was that I could find a local German tire 
dealer who could then do an internal patch on my tire and get me back 
on the road.  My mechanic told me otherwise.  He said that tires are 
not allowed to be repared here because of possible damage to the 
sidewalls during the "flat" period.  I would simply like to have the 
tire repaired so that I can search for new rear tires in peace, not 
rushed into buying a 500DM tire when I can get a cheaper one for 250.

Does anyone know if the tire shops on the US military bases can 
repair tires?  Is there a tire place at Ramstein AB or Vogelweh (I am 
going down in a rental car for a dental appt tomorrow)?

My plan (before the flat) was to buy Bridgestone RE71s -- according 
to the tire rack prices, much cheaper than the Bridgestone S-02.  
Unfortunately, all the German tire dealers here have quoted me around 
400DM for the S-02 (without MWSt) and have said that the RE71 can be 
special ordered for 420DM.  Hmmmm.

Anyone know the treadwear ratings for the S-02 and the RE71? I can't 
really afford a sticky 150 rating on a tire when I could get a 300 
rating on another.  Money is a bit tight these days.

Vielen Dank, nee!
Tim
