The CC on my car does exactly the same thing.. I would like to see a
solution as well.  It was mentioned here a while back that the servo unit
in the engine compartment contains a potentiometer (which reads the
throttle position, and sends the signal back to the CC controller) with a
carbon track, and a wiper contact.. cleaning this up might solve the
problem.  It would make sense if the CC brain was receiving an incorrect 
feedback signal it would try to compensate (incorrectly).

I've never gotten around to taking mine apart, but I think I'll try in the
meantime.  I'll also try to find the article on my hard drive and repost 
it as well.
