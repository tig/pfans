Joona Saluveer asked about wheels and tires for his 84 924.

There are 15 inch wheels available in the oddsized (non VW spacing) 4
bolt pattern on the 924. I have a set of 'Phone Dials' and the more
common 'Spider Web'. They are both 6Jx15 and used 205-60 tires. I bought
the Spider Web last year for $330 for the set with mediocre street feet
(BF Goodrich Comp). Make sure you get the correct bolt for any wheels.
For instance the Phone Dials and Spider Web use different bolts.

Within the past couple of years European Car had a project with a 924
and they found Ronal wheels that fit. I believe 7x16. Seem to recall
they mounted 225-50 tires all around.

Mr. Pasha mentioned fiddling with modular wheels and tires sizes for the
924 in one of his articles or the tech column in Excellence. Dont
remember which one.

The 205- series tires are more than adequate for the car.

Good luck. John Brown 82 924 and 80 931
