<<I have a 1989 944 (2.7L) which I really like, I might be getting a job 
offer in Colorado Springs (I am currently living in The Netherlands,
Europe). What would it take to take this car with me to the US.>>

A really big seat on the airplane? <g> Bribes to the correct
bureaucrats? <g>

<<The car has full cat converter but does not have airbags.>>

Don't worry - we have plenty of cats already. Or does it convert cats
into something else, like 944s? <g>

Seriously, I think you will find it is much cheaper and much easier to
sell your car in the Netherlands and get another one here. The good news
is that used Porsches apparently cost less in this country because so
many were imported.

Check out http://www.haphazard.com/pcd/ before making up your mind. You
are going to love Colorado, particularly in a Porsche.

A Tip. Trying to remove those pesky allen head bolts?

	When trying to remove an almost stripped out allen head bolt (or any other
type fastener for that matter) try putting a dab of valve lapping compound in
the allen heads tip or tool end. The added friction will usually make a tough
job a snap (no pun intended!). 

	Good Luck, Davidjalai@aol.com


PS: Have you noticed new aluminum bolts (used on new German makes) are coated
with a blue-like coating, to prevent dissimular metallic interaction.
