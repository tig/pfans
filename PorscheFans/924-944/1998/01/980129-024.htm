Hello everyone.  I recall thinking about thanking everyone who responded
with friendly advice on my radiator R&R right before Christmas; I just
don't remember doing it, so, Thanks!  Job went well on an unseasonably
warm December morning.  About 4 hours not counting smoke breaks.  In
retrospect even 4 hours seems embarrassingly long for what turned out to
be so trivial given good circumstances - good weather, good light, the
right tools, previous mechanic used a touch of vaseline on the inner
lips of all my hoses, got the car high enough on the first try, and
porschefans friend Roger Moore came out to help and caught all my stupid
mistakes.  Thanks Rog.

I have a hypothesis about our hybrid radiators and their failure mode
which is typically a split seam where the plastic and aluminum come
together.  During removal of my old radiator I noticed one or two of my
rubber mounts seemed in surprisingly good condition.  The other mounts
seemed surprisingly annihilated.  Hmmmmmm.... my hypothesis is that, to
achieve long life, one must mount a new radiator with great care to
achieve an even "pinch" on the part of all the mounts.  It seems to me
that all the mounting stress was on two mounts (drivers-side top &
bottom), collapsed them, and created a wee bit of play.  From there it's
only a matter of time before that radiator seam splits from vibration.
