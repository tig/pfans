pfolks,

Picked up the 944 from the upholtsterer this morning. So as promised here=
s a report.

As you recall I had seats recovered and new carpet installed. The seats =
look fantastic. Really a top quality job and so nice to sit on. All the =
detailing is perfect. He used the original stitching pattern. I asked him=
 to stitch the seams without the piping you always see with vinyl seats. =
He did and it gives it more of a look of leather. When I say that I want =
to stress that I'm not trying to deceive anyone I simply want a leather =
look for myself with the durability and ease of care of vinyl. If I sell =
it I'll be sure to tell anyone that it is vinyl.

The carpeting is really a good job too. The color is a little different =
than I pictured but I think I like it. He didn't purchase a precut carpet=
 so as to save some money but said he wished he had. There are so many =
pieces that have to be cut and trimmed it added a lot of labor time for =
which he didn't charge extra.

One small complaint I have is on the shifter trim he glued the carpet to =
the console and left the plastic trim piece, the one that holds the leath=
er boot, on top of the carpet, and its not fastened down.

Anyone have any ideas how to fasten down the plastic trim piece so that =
it is still removable? I cant place it under the carpet because the carpe=
t edges are not trimmed.

Another item done was he dyed the lower door panels to coordinate with =
the rest. This is really neat. The panels were in good shape but old look=
ing, you know. There like brand new now. I don't know how much that would=
 cost as a separate item but probably not much. If your interior is good =
but your doors are just a little grubby it sure makes a big improvement.

I know this is getting long so I'll get to the finale. He charged me $785=
 for the works. Said he wouldn't do it again for less than 1200.

If anybody is interested in putting some jpegs on a website I could scan =
some pictures. Hey, I might beat Rox to the punch... but I'm not blonde.
