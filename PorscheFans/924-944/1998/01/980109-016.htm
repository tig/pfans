I would recommend the Blizzaks for the reason their soft compound and tread 
pattern is actually optimized for smooth ice only. (This is what their 
marketing and advertising cleverly hides)  They feel terribly squirrelly on 
pavement also.  So much in fact you will think something is loose in the 
rear suspension.  The soft compound is only 50% of the tread depth and then 
they are literally useless.

The best snow/ice tire I have found is the Nokian Happelitta 10.  This is 
the tire the ice racers use.  It will come very very close to equaling the 
Bizzak on smooth ice and out perform it in snow and rough ice.  It also has 
a squirrelly feel on pavement unfortunately but it will definitely give the 
best performance in bad road conditions.  Nokian has other good snow tire 
also if the 10 is not available in your size.  Call Greer Enterprises in 
Wisconsin for them.  I don't have the number with me at the office but I 
can e-mail it to you later.

If you want more of a performance tire or are having fitment issues, try 
the Pirelli Winter Ice.  This is what I put on my 968 this year and they 
are working very well in the snow that we have had so far.  Tire Rack has 
these.

On a side note, I wouldn't necessarily trust Tire Rack all the time.  I 
have found their recommendations change with what they are trying to push 
this week/month.  I have gotten so many different answer to the same 
question at times that I no longer put blind faith in them.  There are a 
few guys there who really know there stuff but they are in the minority.

Good luck and let me know if you what the number for Greer

P.S.  I have experience with the tires I have spoken about.
