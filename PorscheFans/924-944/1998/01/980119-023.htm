	YES, 5W-30 is too light of an oil viscosity if the ambient temp gets above
21'F !  Look in your owners manual if you do not believe me.  
	Here in Washington, DC - I use Mobil-1 15W-50 all year round. If the winter
is especially cold and long - I will switch to 10W-30 for a few months. We
usually only have a few days bellow 20'F, and I take extra care to let the
engine fully warm up on those days. My car has 165K and uses about 1 qt of oil
every 2-3K miles.

Subject: Can You  Argue With Success?

I have always heard that a car with many miles on it should run a heavier
weight oil.  I suppose this is true if blow-by is occurring in the older
engines.  Can there be any other explanation for using a heavier weight oil in
an older engine?   My '87 944S has used Castrol 5w30 for most of its 163,000
mile life and has its filter and oil changed every 3,000 miles. The car is a
daily driver and never tracked or autocrossed.  It uses no oil between changes
at all.  I feel the 5w is easier starting in the winter and gets to the valve
train much quicker than a heavier oil would.  The 30w is also sufficient in
the heat of the summer to protect the engine IMHO.  Could I be missing
something?
