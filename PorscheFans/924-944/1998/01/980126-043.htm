I have a humming (close to howling) noice from somewhere in the front of my
car ('90 S2 CAB). It sounds like it's from the right side of the engine
compartment, but I'm not sure. The noise starts at about 2500rpm and lasts
up about 4000. Last time this happened (9 months ago) I had a balance belt
roller replaced and that seemed to fix it. Now I'm wondering if it is the
same thing and if it is - what else should I take care of at the same time.
Previous posts have lead me to believe that whenever you mess with the belts
you should replace everything (rollers and belts) as these parts are cheap,
but the labor involved is expensive. I have 68000 on the car now and I
replaced the timing belt at app. 55000. Also, what is the deal with the
little plastic part that everyone talks about? (Tensioner of some kind?).
And what about the re-tensioning of the belts after 1500 miles? I know I
didn't have that done.

It seems that a good part of the postings on the list are about when to
change what belts and what else to do. Maybe this could be a topic for the
FAQ?

TIA,
