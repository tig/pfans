Was out for a joyride in my '79 924 today when I made the apparent mistake
of trying to shift into a higher gear as I pulled out of a corner.  Here's
the situation: I'm at a stoplight, the car is in first and the clutch
engaged.  Light changes, I get moving and pull hard through the corner. 
As I'm pulling away, I hit the clutch and pop the gearshift lever out of
second.  Everything is still normal; no strange noises or anything.  I
push the lever up to get it into second and, to my surprise, encounter
virtually no resistance at all.  This is a Porsche, so my first fear is
"clutch is dead."  I back off the clutch, the car comes into gear (first),
put the clutch back in, car goes into neutral, and try for second again. 
Still nothing.  So I keep the clutch in, pull off the road, and stop.  I
try getting in all the gears; I thought for a second I was getting into
third, but after that, nothing, and all gears are mush.  With the
gearshift lever firmly in neutral territory, I let the clutch out, the car
jerks and stalls.  Engine off, clutch out, I try getting into gears (or at
least feeling resistance).  No difference.  Starting to panic by this
time, I pulled off the shift boot (both of them) and feel around in the
metal parts for something broken; seems clear as far back as I can reach.

Now, my first question: what happened?  Bear in mind that I encountered no
noises, shakes, clunks, or thunks.  Gearshifting was crisp, precise, and
smooth up until The Incident.

Some added information: this apparently happened before to the previous
owner (my mom, who is, unfortunately, mechanically illiterate).  She took
the car to a mechanic who presented her with two options: replace the
entire transmission or use modified 911 transmission parts (about $1000+
versus $300).  She opted for the latter.  All she remembers is that some
rod (?) was shortened and welded to other transmission parts.  She also
says that this happened to her no fewer than three times; the first two,
after a little playing, the transmission would "pop" into gear again and
everything was normal.

In case you need (or want) even *more* information: it feels like the
transmission has been shifted "forward;" e.g., I can't move the shifter
down at all, but by pushing up pretty hard I feel like I can just barely
nick the bottom of the upper gears.  The spring resistance for 1st and
reverse (left to right, top to bottom, it's R24, 135) still seems to be
present.

Help please!  Is there another $300 fix or should I start taking offers on
the engine?

And sorry for the length, but this has me really depressed and I'm
desperate for an easy solution.  (The car is at the mechanic's right now,
but maybe you guys can help me get the ball rolling.)
