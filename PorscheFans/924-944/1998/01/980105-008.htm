All,

I usually drive my early 85 944 back and forth to the Huntington Train station.
Round trip, 'bout 12 miles.  Never any problems.
Longer rides (greater that 50 miles) seems be be causing a variety of problems.

1.  Clutch bottoms out, and I have to toe it up, once, and not again for the
rest of the day.  Never happens on shorter rides.  Slave Cylinder?.  I do see a
small leak on the front passenger side, that does not smell like motor oil, but
for the hell of me, can't find where its coming from.

2. Rattling.  Something underneath me seems to rattle slightly at lower RPMs
(1.5 - 2.0) after driving the car for over an hour.  Sounds like its coming
from the catalytic converter area, not the acual engine.  Do these thing rattle
when they are very warm?   Its annoying and makes the car sound like shit.

3.  My idle was boggy at warm start, but this only happened once, but took a
little longer to crank.  When,  at the first stop, the car was fine at idle.  I
had just filled up, but I only use Sunoco 94. ( I have noticed  a small gas
leak at the flange screw in the gas tank.  I tightened it up.  Could this be
comprimising fuel pressure?

The driveability of the vehicle is not compromised by any of this.  The car
still hauls ass (even for an N/A).  I am just concerned that at one point, I
may be stranded in Brooklyn when pickin' up my mom. 

Any ideas would be useful.  I've read the the Haynes troubleshooting, but its
vague, and I don't want to spend hours doing unecessary tests on sensors that
may not be in issue,

Thanks
