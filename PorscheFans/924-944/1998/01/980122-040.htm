Unload the gauge. Zero the gauge using the rotating dial. Load in the
reference shim. Insert the small hex adjusting tool into the little hole
and adjust until the gauge reads 4.0. Remove shim and verify zero. Repeat
until the gauge reads zero unloaded and 4.0 loaded without any adjustment.

You are correct, the gauge isn't perfect and probably isn't the tool of
choice for the NASA technicians trying to adjust the tension on the latest
rover treads or whatever. Just always take the measurement by loading the
tool on the belt and take the measurement on the low side of the hysteresis.
