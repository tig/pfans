>So, Farzaan, have you decided who has the best chance for 2nd place???

I hope it's me :)  This year's event is going to be very tough actually.
The NorthWest Region in SCCA is VERY fast, both in road racing and in
auto-x.  They aren't so hot in import drag racing though.  Bill is obviously
tipped as being in 1st when all the smoke clears.  Gregory Carlson has
the car to beat Bill, but I don't know if he's up to speed yet with his
Talon.  Roger will be very fast and is investing in some new tires for
his "Boeing" modified Talon (he has CNC machined suspension components made
of unobtanium.  Paul and I will both be on street tires, but if it rains,
we hope to be up at the top and if it's dry, the S-02 is only about 1sec
slower on a fast course.

Tom Bogard will be there in his 968, he's very fast usually, but on the
real high speed stuff, his car seems to not work with him, which suits
me just fine :)  We can never forget Wes in his S2 who is really fast on
the slow courses and should be pretty quick on the fast ones.  Tom and
his son may be naturally talented and blow all our doors off :)

If Glen Hernandez decides to participate in his 924S, he will likely 
take 2nd, even on a high speed course.  Glen should've been a karter,
that man can hold momentum, every kink is wide open throttle to that
guy and he makes it stick while doing that.

The only concern I have is that the original clan of three won't even
be near the top :)  We'll be competing amongst ourselves somewhere in
the middle which defeats the purpose of the event.  Bill B. does not
want to run for a trophy, but he still wants to run with us.  This
is very good because you can only become better when you compete
against someone really good.  If Glen H. wants to do the same, that
would be perfect, they are there to have fun with us, but not change
the close-knit event into a typical "open" event.

The best part of this event is that in the last two years, at least 3
people per year have become hooked on auto-xing and improving their street
driving, those same six people have also mentioned that they have
reduced the number of tickets they get on the road dramatically.  That
makes me happy.

I hope that everyone is fighting for that 2nd place finish.  Maybe we
can do it so that Bill B. or anyone who has entered a national championship
cannot run for a trophy, but can go for a placing???  How would you handle
this?  I want to have us compete against the best, but I also want the new
guys to take home some plastic to put on their fireplace.

Hi Guys, 
The Fabcar control arms are very nice and in the long run might be cost
effective. There is one very important caveat that people are overlooking,
that being that the ball joints themselves are completely exposed. There is no
rubber boot for water or grit protection. This means for an everyday driver
those joints are going to need constant maintenance. Like slathering them in
grease periodically. Obviously not a problem for a dedicated track care but
certainly a maintenance liability on a "driver."
The only time I've seen ball joint failures, and they are ugly when they
happen, has been with cars that have been lowered or cars that are depending
on increased diameter anti sway bars for front end stiffening. The worse combo
is a lowered car with a serious swaybar and stock springs. You really should
stiffen up the front with springing rather than depending on "Cup" swaybars.
Kelly Moss will tell you that if the springs are right and the swaybars are
balanced to that spring rate the ball joint may wear out but it won't fail.
They quote a very impressive number (I forget the number) of track hours with
nary a fractured ball joint.
FWIW
Regards, 
Jerry
