Well, I just discovered that my PO may have switched the wheels on me
b-4 I bought the car.  Maybe you all could shed some light:

I own a 1986 944t.  Bought 2 ys ago-it had 31k miles.

I've got all service records, including original window sticker.  I've
looked  the sticker over lots of times.  It lists all standard
equipment, and factory add-on equipment.  Standard equip. includes the
7x16 and 8x16 pressure cast wheels.  Over on the factory add-on equip.
side where additions like the LSD, Sport Shocks, etc, and their factory
add-on price is listed, is this:

"16-inch Forged Alloy Wheels, $491.00".

I assume these are the optional Fuchs wheels.  My car has the phone
dials.  Now, I am not complaining (too much)-I like the phone dials.
However, is it correct that the factory Fuchs are the "better" wheel,
stronger, better for track, etc., than the phone dials?  If nothing
else, is it correct that they are more "valuable" than phone dials?

Does it sound like my PO (I'm the3rd owner) did a switch-a-roo on me?
Is the "Forged Alloy Wheels" the Fuchs style? Is there such a thing as a
forged phone dial wheel?  For all but the most demanding application,
does the wheel type (phone dial or Fuchs) make a big difference?

Thanks in advance for all your help.
