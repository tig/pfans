If only it would stop raining here on the weekends, I could actually be
doing the same thing!  Until yesterday, it had rained for 20 TWENTY straight
days.  We had the rainiest year on record in 1997 and it looks like 98
might just break that record.  The forecast for the next five days is Heavy
Rain and High Winds :(

I don't know about others, but I hate driving my 951 in the rain, I just
feel so cramped;  I like to drive with the windows down and the boost up,
but Mother Nature just doesn't want to co-operate.

The worst thing about this weather is that if it does get sunny, it's always
during the week so all I can do is watch the sun set from my desk and watch
the clouds move in on Friday to ruin another good weekend.

Heck, I haven't washed my poor car since our last snow fall!

Oh well, maybe some time soon, I'll see that little yellow thing in the sky,
I can't even remember what it's called, it's been so long . . .
