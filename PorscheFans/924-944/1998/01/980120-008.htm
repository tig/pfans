Sounds like a bad ground circuit to me, or possibly a bad gauge. Try =
tapping on the gauge itself when it's indicating and see if it responds =
by jumping around. If it does, the gauge has mechanical problems.=20
I've noticed several other folks mentioning that their oil pressure =
gauge sits at 5 and is rock steady. A little hard for me to believe. =
Mine comes up to 4.5-5 on cold start, sits at about 2-2.5 on warm idle, =
and is right on the factory spec at 3000 RPM. (I think it's 3.5, haven't =
checked the book for a while) Note that oil pressure magically 'drops' =
when the lighting circuits are powered on due to the oil pressure gauge =
circuit not having proper voltage regulation. Porsche noticed this =
phenomenon on the 917 when it first ran GP night races, and actually =
spent quite a bit of time in the pits trying to resolve a 'non-problem'. =
It's a wonder they haven't bothered to fix it.
