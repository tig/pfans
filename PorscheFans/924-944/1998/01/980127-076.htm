I have an 89 951 and am toying with the idea of ripping some serious weight 
off of it, yet maintain a modicum of streetability. ( for auto-x and eventual 
time trials) The following list contains potential changes I have in mind and 
my estimation of the weight savings. I would appreciate any comments as to 
viability of the changes, drawbacks, and anything not listed that you thinks 
makes sense. I have just installed euro driving lights with the fog lights and 
want to remove all front headlight assembly, motors, brackets,etc. and replace 
the nose panel with a 1 peice vented panel from GT racing. it weighs 3 # and 
has faux headlight covers. I drive very little at night and the driving lights 
would be my headlights. ( driving lights now have a 100w and a 55w bulb in the 
pair) this could take some significant weight off the nose. 

	change					weight savings
change to lighter front seats				80#
remove rear seatback, (what about seat bottom?)		40#
convert to lexan rear window				55#
nose panel / light removal				50#
remove ac equip under hood				40#
(any pulley suggestions?)				--------
							265# and counting

I would also consider more lightweight body panels/ bumper replacements but 
have been warned about their fragility. This car sees light street use and I 
can live without the ac, but still enjoy my stereo. Wheels are alloy, fairly 
light 993 takeoffs, 9" X 16" X 4.

And to think this project started because the PO's wife backed into the car 
and dented the nose panel, which still needs to be replaced... 

A final question....doesn't stripping weight off the car indirectly have the 
effect of upgrading the brakes and suspension?  Am I better off spending $ on 
coil overs etc. or proceeding down the path to enlightenment??
