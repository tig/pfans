I was concerned about the lack of 4 star for my 83 924, but was told via
this list that these cars particularly later ones run fine without lead.
According to the inside of my fuel cap I need a minimum of 98 Ron fuel,
4* is 97 and Super unleaded is 98 so I tried it. What a difference, no
more pinking when the engine gets hot, smoother running I don't know if
there's more power but it feels that way, may be just because its
smoother that its easier to rev. Didn't improve the hot starting though.
Unless I'm told otherwise I'll keep using Super unleaded (even though I
hate the carcinogenic stuff, but that's another story)as it seems to
enjoy it. Cost is a bummer though, filling up from the warning light
used to cost 36 to 38 pounds now its 38 to 42, once 44 pounds, but it
doesn't pink anymore so its worth it.
