Poodles are much better for that job, especially since I don't like them.
I took my car out the first Saturday that I had it (not even a week yet)
and a *@?! poodle runs out in front of me from nowhere.  At first I was
devasted because I had killed somebody's pet.  But when I got home and saw
that the front ground spoiler was cracked, I was mad.  Nobody ever claimed
the poodle anyway.  So yea, poodles will serve this purpose much better
than Beagles.  Beagles are cute, poodles aren't.  Just my opinion.  Please
no comments from animal rights people.
