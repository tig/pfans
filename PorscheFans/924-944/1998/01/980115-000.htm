Hi Terry,

if you have not found your problem yet, please make sure it is not a
very loose timing belt.
I experienced exactly the symptoms you described and it showed up as
a broken roller that lowered the tension of the timing belt that much
so the belt was able to hit the belt housing which made the sound. 
The belt job was done only 10000miles before I purchased the car.

I hope this is not your problem here, but better safe than sorry...

Greetings

> Hello, I am currently trying to troubleshoot a noise from the distributor cap
