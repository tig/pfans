The above post concerns metal shavings affecting sensors in the
bellhousing, but I've also seen these on the wheel speed sensors for ABS on
my S2.  They stand on end, pointing away from the sensor.  Don't know if
the ABS sensor is magnetic; could be the result of static electricity. In
the last year or so, since I've been doing a lot of heavy braking, it's
seemed like the ABS system is not consistent. Sometimes I can haul down
smoothly from high speeds, and sometimes the brakes shudder so much it
feels like the rotors are warped. The rotors have been replaced, and the
shuddering and grabbing still happens sometimes.  My question is whether
the metal (or other garbage) on the ABS sensors could cause this kind of
inconsistency.  And if so, what's the solution?  TIA
