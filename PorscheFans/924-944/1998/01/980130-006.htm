Hi Stephen - sorry about MY whinge.....I wonder why the Australian market
supports such prices when it can actually take 12 months to sell a 944.
I'd love a good 928 (or even a 968 - which I've come to the conclusion is
really quite a fake), but here in Perth there are very few (probably no
more than 30 928s and 10 968s) .......sigh, maybe I will go back and live
in Pommieland one day just to drive real cars !!

Yes I guess you're right. I am considering a 28 GTS as a second choice
now!

OK....stop whingeing about prices. Firstly there are NO 944 Turbo S
Silver
Rose cars in Australia.
Secondly if there were, think what they'd cost.  The cheapest 944 (an
'83)
will fetch $20,000.......that's UKL8,000-10,000 and US$28,000.
The cheapest S2 is AU$40,000+ (you can do the sums), and a 968 is
AU$65,000....add to this the cost of parts/tyres (e.g. one 225/50*16
Pirelli for an S2 at $475), and you understand why we who live down
under
are really envious of the rest of the civilized world.........almost
enough
to consider moving back to Europe or the US.....(I said almost).
Please don't complain about the price - enjoy it while you can !!
