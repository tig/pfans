At this time, I am unable to reply to the rather intense interest in
Techron.  Eighteen members of the list so far have written accounts of using
Techron and subsequenty having fuel system difficulties--generally the
deterioration of fuel hoses.  So far I have been unable to determine whether
there is a causal relationship between the two events.  Yet, it's an
intriguing question.
Chevron claims (1) adding Techron to a tank of gasoline makes it about 10
times more concentrated than a tank of their gasoline alone and (2) if you
use Chevron, adding Techron "is not likely to add further benefits."  Beyond
that, I cannot add, at present, any useful additional information.
The Society of Automotive Engineers, who Chevron touts as supportive of the
efficacy of their product, apparently has no technical papers on hoses,
rubber, and the (trade secret) polyether amines.  There is no doubt but that
it cleans injectior, valves, etc.
I regret posting my previous (unscientific) test because many members
concluded even the occasional use of Techron would do harm to their fuel
system.  I have no evidence either way on this question.
If I find out anything useful from published data or my own experiments
recently undertaken, I'll post it to the list.  As a former chemist, I am
not about to do anything irresponsible, but I do want to find out what I
can.
Regards to the list,
