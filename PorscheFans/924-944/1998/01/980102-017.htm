For those who have put child seats in the rear seat of their car, how did
you secure it?  The 2-point seat belt mount points are too far forward to
adequately restrain the seat.

If anyone is interested, perhaps we can add something to the FAQ or
somewhere about child seats, as I have seen more than one inquiry over
time.  For those who have them, if you want to send me the seat model,
how you installed it, and any other comments, I would be glad to compile
things.  I will post my findings when I'm finally done.  Perhaps airbag
cutoffs could be included as well.
