Is this good or bad?

I guess the answer is that if you use Techron, pour it in the
tank, and then drive the car until all the gas is gone.

Thanks to everyone who responded to my posting about the alleged brain problem
on my 1988 924S.  Based on the suggestions from you all, I decided my course
of action and picked up the brain from my mechanic this afternoon and dropped
it off at my local electronics repair shop.  They have repaired much of my
equipment before, and they were more than willing to look at it for cracked
and cold solder joints and loose connections.  Meanwhile, I am also looking
into purchasing a used one from one of the members on this list.  If my
electronics shop finds something within the next day or two, I will take it
back and install it in the car and see what happens.  If they don't find
anything, or can't look at it within a day or two, I'll probably buy one used
if I can get a gentleman's agreement with the seller that if it does not work,
I can return it, or maybe work something else out over the phone.  I am told
that since the 1988 has 10 more HP and higher compression than the 1987, that
the DME is not the same, and I need to get one from a NA 1988.  So, with that
in mind, if anybody has one and is sure it is from a 1988 (the number
0-261-200-086 is on it), then please e-mail me and we can work out getting
together on the phone.

Thanks.

Well, the saga continues. I have determined that my clicking fuel relay is due
to not enough steady trigger voltage at the transistor that controls the
relay. I have determined that if I have only one fuel injector plugged in it
will not click and there is enough voltage to keep the relay closed, but if I
connect any two injectors, does not matter which (even though they fire as
pairs) I get the click. All the injectors indicate the same resistance on an
ohmeter, so either there is not enough current getting to the them, which the
transistor apparently senses, or they are using too much, which seems unlikely
at this point, since I cannot imagine that they have all gone wacko at once.
One member of the group suggested installing a capacitor across the relay coil
to stabilize the juice, which makes me wonder if there is one in the dme which
is shot. There does seem to be a huge demand for the schematics on the dme,
based on my in-mail this morning, so if I find a source I will post it. As
usual, any thoughts on this appreciated. Frenna@aol.com (87924S)
