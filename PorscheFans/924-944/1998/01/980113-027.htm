I have used 3 sets of R1s for PCA driver's ed events over the past several
years. I wouldn't use them on the street. Here's why:

1. In the great Northeast (upstate New York), it rains. When it rains, your
R1s become beautiful hydroplanes, without rudders. On a 944, the effect is
like watching Bambi take his first steps.....all four wheels try to go in
different directions at once. This may not be so important if it doesn't
rain where you live.

2. After as little as 5-10k street miles, you'll need a new set. Granted,
they're not as expensive as the full-tread street tires, but the frequent
change-overs are a pain....

3. Handling is great, at the cost of substantially greater ride harshness.
If you need to have 10 tenths performance on tap at all times on the
street, perhaps you can live with it. I find anything more than 6/10 in a
944 is better pursued in a controlled environment, i.e., the track.
Meantime, my street tires (BFG Comp T/A ZRs) roll merrily along without as
much fuss, and without as much "nibbling" from side to side as we hit the
expansion joints. The constant steering corrections meeded with R1s on such
surfaces are tiring on long trips.

Am I being too practical? Perhaps, because I live in the nation's capital
of driver's ed events, PCA Zone I. With all the roundy-round time available
here, I don't feel the need to push it on the street quite so much.
