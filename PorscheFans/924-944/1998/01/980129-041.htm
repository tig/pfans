Clark,

WHY is your daughter sending email to the Spice Girls? Does she have an
inside connection or something? If so, here's an idea that I am SURE
will garner plenty of support. Plus, it'll be a lot of fun for all
involved. Have her contact this popular group of highly intelligent and
talented gals, and propose the following: 

The "Spice Girls 944 Tune-Up & Maintenance Video".

Imagine the Spice Girls screwing around with torque wrenches, nuts and
bolts...changing filters, fluids, belts and clamps -- all to a cool
soundtrack, of course. Hmmm. We could even have a special version called
"The Spice Girls Do The 944" but it would likely have a pretty
restrictive rating, and not open in the mega-cineplex with Disney movies
playing down the hall.

My guess is that we would have LOADS of support from The List in
critical areas, like loaning tools, cars, opening doors, and holding
makeup mirrors. Personally, I'll volunteer to help the on-camera talent
with fitting-getting in/out of the costuming....powder blue jumpsuits
with Porsche and PorscheFans logos, revealing cutouts...you get my
drift... Hey, I'll even bring my (P9201) belt tension tool.

Oh yes, one more thing, your daughter does better at email than some of
my clients -- and a few List members -- no garble, HTML tags, endless
quoting, or other junk. (Just thought proper credit should be given.
Encourage this and maybe she'll have a future in computers or other
techical endeavors. It's that, or become a future Spice Girl...)
