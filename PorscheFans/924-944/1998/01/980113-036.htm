Hi all,

Haven't piped-up since I spoke of replacing my radiator.  Many thanks to 
everyone who responded with tips.  Thanks to Roger Moore who actually 
joined me to put it in.  The job went smooth and got done right the 
first time.

When I first bought my car, with over a quarter million miles on it, the 
speedo would stop working intermittently.  Within a couple weeks, it 
stopped working altogether and my shop replaced it (at GREAT expense for 
the part).  I've driven about 24k miles since, and within the last two 
months, it's been intermittent again.  It would always start to work 
fine during the same outing in which it malfunctioned.  I might lose it 
for 4 or 5 miles and then it would come back in and the odo would start 
rolling again.

Last Thursday, it stopped working and has twitched since.  In the past, 
the intermittent failures were ALWAYS connected to water somehow.  Rain, 
slush, even heavy dew as the sun rises.  But this time, it's had plenty 
of time to dry out since the last rain.  My technician suggested a month 
ago that the little generator that sticks out of the trans about the 
driver's CV joint might be getting shorted by water.  He sincerely 
doubts the generator itself has failed.  My examination of the rubber 
boot on it turned up nothing.  I was hoping to find it torn or cracked, 
allowing water to short the two little wires that emerge from it to 
carry the pulse to the speedo, but it doesn't look like it.  Anyone have 
any other ideas?

As addition data, when the speedo fails, so do the odometer and CASIS 
shift light.  And the fuel consumption gauge moves but reads 
incorrectly.

TIA
Dave Cherry
