Thanks for the post.  I was not the one who posted about flushing the
pump.  The mineral deposits are pretty normal in any of the cars with
extensive use of aluminum.  Yes, distilled water would help.  We put the
housings in our walnut shell blaster (like sand blasting but non
destructive) to remove the deposits.  A medium bristle metal brush will
probably work fine.  We use a Dow Corning product called 111 to help
seal any rubber or viton gaskets/0-rings that we install.  Simple Green
is a good cleaner to use to degrease products.  We use Auto Magic #5,
which is a degreaser used by clean-up/detail shops on parts that we
don't clean in our cleaning vats.

Your overheating, if it continues can be from a deposit clogged
radiator, which is common to the pre 85/2 cars.  We have not found a
radiator shop that can successfully 100% of the time bend the tabs back
that hold the end caps of the radiator on without breaking them (so the
radiator can be internally rodded out).  There probably is some form of
chemical soak that might clean the deposits out.
