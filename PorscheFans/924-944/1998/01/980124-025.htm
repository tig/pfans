Mark and pfolks,
You bring up the point of good weather. That is a very good point. I tend=
 to take for granted the warmer weather here. We may want to wait to ask =
for submissions once weather becomes decent. Unfortunately for some I'm =
primarily speaking of the US and Canada. You, yourself have put the 951 =
away 'til March.

We don't need to table the whole idea until then but just not expect some=
 of the folks to be able to contribute. We couldn't think of a video with=
out Mr. WOT, now, could we!! And Rox, too, but I think she's in sunny CA.

Whoever will be the central person can go ahead and make preparations and=
 possibly get some submissions from those who can make video now.

I wholeheartedly agree we should keep this close to the list and not let =
it become a commercial venture. Mark, since this was your original idea =
if you want to take on the task I'll help in any way. We may find we need=
 more than one central location.

That's a great list of projects. Just think of how many things can be don=
e. Can you say 1631??
