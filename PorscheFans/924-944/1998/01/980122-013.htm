I have an absolute favorite corner here in Orlando.  Its a rather large,
decreasing radius off ramp, with two lanes to play in so that if traffic
is in front, you can really enjoy the handling of your car while slicing
through.  Well this morning, there were several cars in front of me when
we left the light on the way to that corner.  I got past all but one
prior to corner entry and was on the inside of the last one as the
corner started to tighten.  I knew I was going a bit fast for the inside
line of that corner, but also knew I'd be past him before it got too
tight.  I was thinking in my mind about the thread on quick
countersteers and as the corner tightened and the tires started
squealing I kept that in mind.  About halfway through the turn the
corner really tightens up, if you're not ready for it you'll follow the
groove through the trees where many others who made that mistake have
landed.  (a few weeks ago a guy on a Honda RC 45 tossed his limited
edition $25K motorcycle off there)  My car started getting a bit loose
as I hauled into the tightening radius.  At about 75 mph and in the
tightest section the rear end started swinging.  I snapped a quick
countersteer, but only about half of the distance my intuition told me
too, and it came right back.  What a great car.  

I've done quite a bit of playing with other rear wheel drive cars in
rain, snow, etc.  And have always thought that I had a handle on
countersteering.  A few months back some of you will remember that I
sent my 944 around in a circle on the street because I believe I
overcorrected and lifted throttle.  That second rear end pendulum was
WAY out of my control.  I've since done some practicing with slide
control, re-teaching myself to keep my foot in it when it kicks out (on
a motorcycle I never let off it the rear end steps out - we call that
mistake -high siding- because of the way the bike will toss you up and
over when that rear tire hooks up) so I have no idea why I let off in
the car.  Oh, I think I'm rambling, so I'll get to the point... I think
our cars require a slightly different feel when countersteering, and
that they over correct much sooner than the american cars most of us
learned on as kids (what were we thinking?).  So if you aren't
practicing your countersteering...it may surprise you one day when you
have to use it.  So, slide that car around, act like a teenager and tell
the cop you're practicing your countersteering so that your family and
loved ones will be safer.
