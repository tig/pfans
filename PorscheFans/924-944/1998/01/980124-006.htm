The 944 block as produced by Porsche is liner-less.  The cylinders and
block
are cast in one operation, utilizing a special high silicon aluminum alloy.
After boring, the cylinders are honed in a manner that removes only the
aluminum, leaving the Silica crystals as the actual cylinder surface (as
Clark
said in his post). 

I was always under the impression that the cylinders were one piece in the
944 blocks. However, Chris claims that the aluminum sleeves have an
aluminum liner. Additionally, he says that a machine shop is currently
replacing the liners in his block. If I had known this, or my machinist had
known this, I would have probably opted for replacing the liners instead of
having my block bored and resiliconized. It seems strange that the shop
manual would have a procedure for resiliconizing the cylinder walls and
none for replacing liners. 

Anybody have any thoughts on this?
