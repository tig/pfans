I noticed someone mentioned having one page with links to everyone else's
pages. My page is running on my friends computer (cable modem) and its
always on as he has his site as well, so If you want I could do it since its
will cost me nothing. my page is at http://24.1.162.3/shaun

on the topic of the VDO boost, gauge, I haven't seen one myself, but I get
all my stuff from vision (hence the add on my page) and they always have
extremely good prices, so I'm sure there is a reason for the price and I
know the gauge case is designed specifically for the 951 and I know Dwain
(the owner of the shop) hates things that don't fit perfectly.
