Thanx to everyone who put in their 2 cents on my fuel line problem. It
seems that 2 fuel return lines are recalled, but not the main pressure
line. They all have the same couplers(which is the problem) but I think
they didn't recall the main line because of the amount of labor involved in
replacing it. If Porsche has a dark side its when it comes to fixing
expensive design flaws for free.

If anyone knows where to write, or who to call at PCNA to complain, I'd
like to give them a peice of my mind. My mechanics parts guy said that this
is a common repair on all turbo's and considering the results of mixing gas
with spark plugs, I think all turbo's should have been recalled. This hose
is a menace! I suggest any turbo owners carefully inspect their hoses if
they've never been replaced.
Good Day!
