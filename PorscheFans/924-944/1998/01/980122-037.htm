Howdy,

My vote may come as a surprise.  From what I remember, the question was,
what do you think is the most significant water cooled Porsche.  For 
significance, I would say the 85.5 944.  My older brother bought an 86
944 way back in 1987 and I fell in love with that car right there and then.

But, I'm going to add a twist, which watercooled Porsche do I think is
the most exceptional . . .  There is only one car I'd rather have than
my 89 951 and that's a 968 Turbo S.  I don't want a Turbo RS because they
seem to be too unreliable, but the Turbo S is a car I would sell my kidney
for :)

If someone offered me a 993TT, I would still have to keep my 951, but if
someone offered me a 968 Turbo S, I would be willing to give up my 951.
Think about it, you can have a 993TT which are about as common here as
a Mercedes E-series or a 968 Turbo S, a VERY, very rare Porsche.
