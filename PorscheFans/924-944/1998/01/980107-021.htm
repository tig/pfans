Thanks for the input, Michael. I'll add that I had a new balance shaft belt
slip in just 1100 miles.  And all I did was accept an invitation from a
T-bird to drag to the next stop light.  The vibration set in immediately. 
Depending on how much you trust your mechanic, you might want to have it
retensioned sooner, particularly if you're scheduled for some hard driving.
 During this episode, I had two putatively good mechanics in two states
screw up the timing, one a dealership mechanic who had worked in Germany
(are there no absolutes in life?).  Overall, it took 5 tries to get it
right. Obvious advice, but when you have a balance shaft belt replaced,
make sure the engine feels the same as it used to when you drive away.
