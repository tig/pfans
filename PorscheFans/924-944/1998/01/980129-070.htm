I haven't seen one of these, but I did look at their ad in Excellence
and it looks like in addition to just the gauge, tee and hose, they are
also selling a mounting case that custom designed for the 951.  I 
haven't talked to them, and the picture's real small so its had to tell
the quality of the mount. But it doesn't look too bad. So what they're
charging the extra $35 is for the custom mount. Depending on the
quality, that might be a good deal for someone. At $35 a shot for the
case , they're not going to get rich. Its a limited market after all.
