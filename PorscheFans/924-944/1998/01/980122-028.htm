Having just bought an '84 Euro' 924 and recently subscribed to this
list, these two posts got me thinking:-

So there are lots and lots of Do-it-yourselfers on our list here, right?
I'd like to see someone put together a video tape of common repairs and
maintenance duties for our car.  You know... things like oil changes,
wastegate shimming, chip installations, CV joint procedures, brake
bleeding, etc...  We could also put some video of our cars at the track
and other such footage.  

The technical information would be quite valuable and it would really be
nice to put a face with the names we see regularly on the list.  What do
people think?

Sounds neat. Should be easy enough to recruit listmembers to take on a
project but how could we distribute this to all interested members...
purchase? say, for just cost of tape and shipping? or maybe contributors
could receive some amount of royalty if we could keep cost reasonable? I
would be willing to transfer individual videos to a master and then send
to interested listmembers. If we had enough contributions we could do a
series like "Engine compartment", "Suspension and Brakes",
"Transmission", etc. The more I think about this the better it sounds.
Lets get some discussion going.

I make video 'programmes' (correct English spelling :-) ) for a living
so have all the necessary equipment and expertise to put such a
tape/series of tapes together.  However I live in the UK. :-(

So, are there any avid diy-ers near Watford (20 miles from London) who
may be interested in getting involved over here ? - If nothing else we
could perhaps produce something for inclusion into a tape edited in
America ?

As I'm posting this anyway, I have a question.  I believe many of the
parts on my 924 are sourced from VW/Audi. - I've already noticed that
the door handles seem to be the same as on my wife's VW Jetta. - Is
there a list or FAQ available which cross-references parts ?
