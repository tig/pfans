So, I put it on a flatbed and brought it home. Sometimes it'll start and
run for a period of time, but then starts hesitating and dies--like it's
starved for fuel. After it dies, it usually won't start for at least ten or
twenty minutes. I checked the distributor, all accessible electrical
connections, and the DME (no water).

Just a w.a.g. but check out your alternator.  If it is not charging and the
battery voltage is dropping this could be your problem.  I had a similar
problem and when I called my trusty Porsche mechanic from the car he said
he would send his kid over with a freshly charged battery and that would
get me home.  I thought he was jerking my chain but it worked!  Repaired
alternator (actually just a bad harness) and the problem disappeared.  The
reason it starts with a jump or after it sits is because a battery will
recover a small amount of its charge when it sits idle for a while then
when the voltage drops the car dies.  If I remember correctly he told me
when the voltage drops below a certain level the system shuts itself off .
