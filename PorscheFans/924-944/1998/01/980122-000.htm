Hi P-Fans,

Last Friday my turn signal was broken.  The interior signal indicator would
not blink, just stuck in the "on" lighted position when I signal right or
left.  The outside of the car, the signal lights don't come on at all.  On
sunday, I checked the fuses, they were okay; so I figured the flasher relay
is busted.  It was a sunday afternoon, so no parts available.  Out of
curiosity I opened the flasher-relay.  Saw nothing I could do, and
reinstalled the assumed broken relay.  

Monday, my signal lights worked normally!  It's now Wed night, and the
blinkers still all work fine.  

My question is, is there such a practice as "airing out" relays or fuse
boxes?? What could have caused or fixed the problem I experienced for 3
days (F-S)?  

TIA,
tony
