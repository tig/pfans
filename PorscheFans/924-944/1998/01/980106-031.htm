Good thinking David,

But Joeybabe, your car has plug-in fuses (changed at 85.5),

	I went through the same thing on my 87 - 944. What was done was
as follows:

	Replace DME-Relay cost $35 - did not fix problem
	Cleaned - Harness and connectors for fuel injectors + Edge
connectors on DME board (rain drips in when Bat try leaks)
	The cleaning solved the problem !

	Problem is this.
	After driving about an hour, particularly if in traffic it just
dies.<

	I had the same problem last year with my 84 944, right after I
bought
	it. I would leave for work in the morning (a 30-minute drive),
and about
	20 minutes later, EVERY DAY, it would die and leave me on the
side of
	the road. If I waited about 20 minutes without cranking it, it
would
	start right up, but die again about 20 minutes later, depending
on how
	long I had let it sit. It seemed to be worse in damp weather.

	I checked everything I could think of, including the fuses.
Several
	mechanics had no idea about why this was happening. Finally one
night
	when I was stranded in a parking lot, about 5 minutes after the
car had
	died, the voice of God said, "TWIRL THE FUEL PUMP FUSE." So I
did, and
	sure enough I turned the key and the car roared to life. I drove
home,
	and the next day, when the light was better, I squeezed the fuse
	contacts closer so that the fuse would be held tighter. Also,
just for
	the heck of it, I replaced all the fuses.

	My favorite theory is that the fuel pump fuse, which was old but
did not
	appear broken, was just barely making contact with the fuse box.
When
	the car warmed up, the fuse contacts spread just enough to break
contact
	with the fuse. It also could be that there was some microscopic
crack in
	the fuse, and the crack widened when the car warmed up. Anyway,
my
	problem was solved. The car has never died since. Hope this
helps.
