Andrew,

Remove the cross over exhaust pipe between the turbo and the exhaust 
headers.  You need to remove some heat shields around the brake reservoir 
to get at the Turbo.  This is a large bulk of the job.  You will see.

You need to support the engine from its lifting hooks.  I built a crane 
that sits on the inside fenders over the shock towers.  It was made of 2 
X 4s screwed and bolted together.  I can provide a photo and details of 
this tool if you have Microsoft Word or can read JPEG files.

Once the engine is supported, you must remove the steering rack from the 
aluminum suspension cross member,  I also disconnected the steering shaft 
at the rack and let the whole assembly hang.

Pull the mounts for the two A arms off after marking with paint the 
location of the rear mounts.  Let them dangle.

Remove cross member by unbolting at the motor mounts and chassis.  get it 
out of the way.

Oil pan is now available for removal and replace gasket with a brand new 
one.  It took me several days of messing around.  I was quoted about $700 
at an independent shop.  Have fun!
