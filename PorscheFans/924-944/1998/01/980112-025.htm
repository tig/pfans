PFan colleagues:

Today Minneapolis, Minnesota is getting its first big snow of the year (a 
little later than usual I might add).  So far there are 5 inches on the 
ground and its still coming.  My 968 with LSD and Pirelli Winter Ice tires 
(and no additional weight in the back) did just fine getting me to the 
office this morning.  I am running the Pirellis in the sizes Porsche 
recommended, 205/55/16 front and 225/50/16 rear on 7 and 8 inch wheels 
respectively.

As to the Blizzaks, I have experience with them as well as a large number 
of other wither tires.  I DO NOT recommend the Blizzaks.  Here are the 
reasons:

	1)The very soft multicell compound is only the top 50% of the tread.  Once 
it is got they turn into rather run of the mill 	all season tires.
	2)The Blizzaks perform the best on flat smooth ice.  Even their marketing 
refers to the traction on ice.  It says nothing 	about snow.
	3)They have got to be the squirrelist tire on dry pavement I have ever 
driven.  The first time I drove them I actually 	drove about 1 mile and 
returned home to check my rear suspension as I thought something was broken 
and/or loose. 	I have other friends from the Audi Quattro club that 
wouldn't be caught dead on Blizzaks.

Needless to say the question that begs to asked becomes: "Michael, what do 
you think is a good winter tire is?"  I love the Nokian Happelillttas in 
the ultimate in winter traction.  This tire will meet the performance of 
the Blizzak on Ice and outperform it in snow.  When I do time trials in the 
winter on lake tracks with my Audi 4000 quattro, no one shows up with 
Blizzaks, they all run the Happelittas, either studded or unstudded.

There are ads in the back of AutoWeek for the Happelittas.  The only 
problem with the Haps are a somewhat limited size range.  This is why I 
could not put them on the 968.  They were not available in the correct 
sizes.

Tire Rack does not sell the Haps, therefore they don't say much if anything 
about them.  Realize Tire Rack is in business to make a profit and they're 
not going to do that by recommending a tire they don't carry.  Unknown to 
many, Tire Rack's parent company, Veldman Tire Distributing has contracts 
with many of their vendors to warehouse the vendors' tires for the vendors. 
 This means Tire Rack is being paid to warehouse the tires and then paid by 
you & me to purchase them.  In addition, I have significant experience with 
telemarketing organizations, and trust me, I can guarantee you that the 
best tire/product for car depends on what the sales spiffs are that week.
