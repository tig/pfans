OK, I am no Mr. 951 by any means, so please do not flame me if I am wrong. 
I have been watching this subject as I may be buying a 951, so here my
take on it. The performance advantage if any will be due to replacing a
functioning part with a non-functioning part, or at least nobody has said
that the 993 part is polished better and allows more flow or something
like that. Plus, the 993 variant has a metal diaphragm as compared to a
plastic one on the 951 part thus it is expected to last much longer. 

As I understand it, the difference noticed will be that the turbo does not
lose as much rpm when shifting as exhaust gases are "recycled" back to the
turbo when off of the throttle as compared to being dumped out of the
exhaust and the turbo retaining rpm due to inertia only.  On the road,
this will be felt as boost being maintained much better between shifts.  I
have driven two 951 examples where I believe this part was bad.  After
each shift it felt like the turbo had to spool up from no rpm, resulting
in very peaky and uncomfortable power curves even after the first gear. 
 When the part works well, the low-end torque should be much better.

OK, 951 gods, am I completely wrong about this?  If so, should I put my
Nomex suit on now?
