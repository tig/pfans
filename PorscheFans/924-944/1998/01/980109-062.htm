Yes!  Fill the transmission until the oil starts to drool out the fill
hole.  The level should be just at the bottom of the fill hole.  Fill
slowly, as oil may come out prematurely, giving the impression the gearbox
is full when in fact it is not.  You can jack up the car on the passenger
side should you want the oil level slightly below the fill hole.. I doubt
it matters, though.  I probably overfilled mine slightly this summer, as
it did take about 2 1/2 quarts (including some spillage).

If you are wondering how to fill.. I just bought some clear hose at the
hardware store and pushed it over the bottle nipple.  Use the largest
diameter that will fit tightly on the nipple, or the oil will be difficult
to squeeze through it.  I then threaded the hose though a top opening in
the rear wheel, over the exhaust pipe, and into the transmission.  I then
stood patiently by the wheel with the bottle held up above transmission
level, and patiently squeezed away.
