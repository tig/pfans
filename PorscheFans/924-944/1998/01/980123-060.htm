Hi, 
I have an '84 944 and am looking for a dashboard cover to hide the infamous
cracks.  I am sure that this has been asked before, but I personally haven't
seen the solutions.  Thanks for any help.

Steve

We cut off the old crimp and hose and reband new hose with a high pressure,
hydraulic band. All of the rubber parts are new and rebanded with new bands.
We charge $150.00 plus shipping
