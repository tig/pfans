I asked the same question of my mechanic when I had mine apart last
month.  He said grab the belt driven pulley and try like hell to move it
(up/down/left/right).  If there is ANY play WHATSOEVER in that bearing,
replace the pump.  Mine had some play, the new one did not...

Just a little more on the control arm/ball joint topic.

First, I did not say that we don't have cars that show ball joint wear, or
accelerated ball joint wear due to track driving out here in California.  I
specifically referred to "catastrophic failure," and Northern California.  I
believe that Farzaan's car shows wear, and that he lives in Canada.  My own
'89 control arms showed ball joint wear at 32,000 miles and 2-3 track
weekends.  The Zim's rebuilds are holding up well, after one full track/AX
season.

Second, the Porsche Motorsports arms are not the same as the M030 parts used
on the Turbo S and the '89 Turbo.  The Motorsports parts have a different ball
joint shaft.  I have seen these parts at Kelly-Moss in Madison, WI. They had
shelves full of Porsche Motorsports 944 and 951 parts when I visited them back
in April 1994.  The Motorsports control arms have non-replaceable ball joints,
and cost $600 - 700 each, or more.  So they are almost as expensive as the
Fabcar arms.

Third, there are a number of places which make some sort of steel or billet
aluminum control arms for 944 and 951 track cars, with replaceable ball
joints.  I am not sure which are "in production" and generally available for
sale, but I know they are out there.

Finally, and here is my main point: in our litigious society, why would Alwin
Springer write a definitive letter to the editor (Panorama, June 1995) on this
subject?  How could the Porsche AG and/or PCNA lawyers let him do this?  Why
would he do this?  He is a very smart, and nice man (I met him at Laguna-- he
gave myself and several friends a private tour of the GT 1).  On the other
hand, why would IMSA require Fabcar arms (actually I have never seen anything
in print on this)?

So, you pays your money and you takes your choice.  I will buy the Fabcar arms
when my '87 is lightened to 25-2800 lbs, gets a cage, and becomes a dedicated
race car.  I'll probably buy 'em from Bill at OG Racing or Jeff Stone at KMR.
That is, unless something better comes along.  But I won't spend the $1600
until that time.
