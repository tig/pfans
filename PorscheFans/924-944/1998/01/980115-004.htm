Tony,

I own a 1981 924, and I have the same problem. I believe something had worn
off in your trip odometer. What I did was improvished a little screw and
small mount that pushed the trip button slightly down. This somehow allowed
the mechanism to caught and start working.

Above is a sideview of the speedometer. The vertical H is the speedometer
clear plastic cover. The ==O on the left is your trip odometer button. The
things on the right is the mount (vertical member) and the screw being
screwed through the mount. By screwing deeper, you increase pressure on the
trip button. At the right depth, the odometer will start working. This have
to be done while the car is moving.

You can do this which costed me pennies, or you can invest in a new
speedometer which I have done too. My new one later went kaput too. My
mechanic repaired it for a short while before it went dead again.

It's difficult to repair because it is all sealed up.
