Larry and pfolks,
So sorry to hear about the fire. Where are you located? I was just in the=
 parts store and the guy at the counter said he was in Oakland CA a few =
days ago and saw a 924/944 on fire. Was that yours? Or anybody else's on =
the list?

Just bought the new O2 sensor. Its even easier to install than I had figu=
red. Bosch makes a universal sensor, cost US$24.95. All you do is cut the=
 old one off, remove some insulation, slide the wire into a metal sleeve =
and crimp it. Then slide the heat tube over the metal sleeve and heat shr=
ink it. Your done.
