A note to all you people out there making fun of me for not driving my new
baby during the winter months - Chicago happens to be the home to Morton
Salt, so it doesn't take a rocket/Porsche scientist to figure out what is
used to make the snow go away here in the "Windy City".  BTW, no more
scavenging of 968 parts for right now, as it is too cold at the present
time, and I don't want "baby" to catch a chill.
