You'll see a big plastic thing (by the motor) that looks a little like this:
     _________
  __/         |
 /            |
 |____________|

Anyways, there are two little switches that the big bump, then the little dude
on top hit.  When that happens, it stops.  The switches they hit are held on
with screws that had come loose on my car.  Look for some little white boxes
with things that go click when you push on them sticking out. 
Now CAREFULLY lower the sunroof 'till it's just about closed (just barely not
closed) and move the little white boxes till they almost touch the big white
plastic dude I drew above.  The big white plastic dude moves along with the
"gear wire" (as I call it, the long thing that eventually drives the sunroof
gears at the top of the car) and will now hit the switch and make it stop.
