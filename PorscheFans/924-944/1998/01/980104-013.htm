No doubt we're talking *trucks* here, you know, the kind with the
bodies/frames jacked in the air for greater off-road ground clearance
(and
higher cg!), and huge tires.

The problem is trucks and SUV's don't have the same bumper height
restrictions as cars do. Raise a pick-up truck's rear step bumper 5" and
see where it would hit your car... the recent popularity of SUV's has
made
the situation much worse and some lawmakers have (obviously) been
spurred
into action.>>

That was obviously the _intent_ of the law, but as written it will
forbid any vehicle that isn't completely stock. And this law is
apparently already a reality in Maryland. Fortunately, it is not
strictly enforced, and it is primarily used to assign blame when people
get squashed like bugs. I think the problem could be solved by passing
legislation that forbids _any_ vehicle that blocks visibility from using
the left lane. Let them poke along behind grandpa in the right lane. ;-)
