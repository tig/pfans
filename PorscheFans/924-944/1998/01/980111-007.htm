Wolfgang,

Unfortunately you cannot replace the synchros without using a hydraulic 
press.  There are bearing races and hub sprockets which need 
considerable force to take them off and put them on.  There are also a 
number of other tools which are helpful in correctly rebuilding a 
transmission.  Generally, the labor in a shop should be about eight to 
ten hours, depending on whether you also replace all the bearings as 
well.

Kevin

Joel,
I have an 88 951S and I run ATE fluid and Hawk Blue pads. I don't have the
Cool Brakes or SS lines.  I drive about 1500 track miles per year and ride
about another 2500 with students, mostly at Lime Rock Park and Watkins Glen.
I agree with Jerry's comments (all except the "AO=>=AO" stuff!)  that you're
over-using your brakes.  The good news is, you must be carrying a lot of
speed, and braking is typically the last thing we learn to do well.

I also have an additional suggestion.  When I had my 85.5 NA 944, I loved the
carbon kevlar pads.  When I bought the 88 Turbo S, I bought a set for that car
as well, but I found them to be much less effective, not so much at LRP (not a
lot of braking) but at WGI.  Could be the higher speeds pushed them out of the
optimum heat range for the compound I was using (they were the standard heat
range -- blue, I think) or it could have been a quality issue -- Cool Carbon
had gone out of business and other companies were stepping in.  In any event,
I was experiencing a soft pedal and the pads wore out in about 2.5 days -- of
a 3 day event.  Fortunately, another instructor had an extra set of Hawk Blue
pads to sell me.  They're fantastic -- hard pedal, minimal fade, excellent
wear, but dusty and a little tough on rotors (though rotors don't cost that
much more than good track pads!).
Have fun,
Kevin B
