Nick,
       Porsche has used several different drive arrangements for the 944
sunroof. On mine (1986 951) the lifting arms are raised by the plastic
gears and the plastic gears are driven by the drive cable. On another 1986
951 I worked on, the cable was routed differently so that the lifting arms
were driven directly by the cable. The production date on this car was
about 2 months older than mine. Since yours is an '85 it is possible that
yours is driven directly by the cable. If this is the case, it is possible
that your cable is broken.  If you get to the point of pulling your
headliner back to look at the mechanisms, the one driven directly by the
cable will have the drive cable tube attached to the bottom (nearest the
rear hatch) of the mechanism on one side and exiting the top of the
mechanism on the other side. For the ones with the plastic gears, the drive
cable tube will be attached at the bottom on both sides of the mechanism.
Additionally, you will see a round protrusion from the cover plate of the
plastic gear mechanisms (where the shaft of the plastic gear rides). Also,
I believe the covers on the plastic gear mechanisms use 5 Phillips head
screws instead of 4 screws for the direct cable driven mechanisms (don't
quote me on this one because it's been about a year since I've seen one of
those).
 Hope this helps. Let me know what you find.

Clark Fletcher
