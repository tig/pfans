The trick to removing the rotor is heat. Place a soldering Iron on the set
screw, get it hot then just unscrew.

	Hello Manfred

		Chances are you have the original rotor or some has glued it
on in place. You
	will need to carefully crush the old rotor off with some pliers or
vise-grips.
	If you feel uncomfortable take you car to a compentent Porsche
repair shop.
	Make sure you use blue loctite to secure the rotor's set screw! The
Germens
	love to glue on the rotors from the factory, VW used this same
method on their
	16 Valve engines too!

							Good Luck,
DavidJalai@aol.com

	Subject: Exhanging my rotor?

	Hi everyone,

	Can somebody tell me how to replace the rotor on my '88 944?
	I tried to get it of by unscrewing the bolt that's in it, but it was
	still holding on to something...
	Should I use a special tool or something to pull it off?

	Manfred

P-fans,

Just a special note of thanks to Ezra, Roxanne, and George B. who gave me the
information on replacing my clutch master and slave cylinders.  Bottom line is
that both of them were culprits that caused my clutch pedal to stay glued to
the floor.  Both are now replaced with genuine P-parts.  As a side benefit,
the entire hydraulic system has new fluid now and the car has never stopped so
well.  I am now a fan of annual hydraulic fluid replacement . . . . . a P-car
mechanic told me that with fluid replacements every 1-2 years I will probably
never have to replace the cylinders again.

Now if I can just get a little free time and replace the bad motor mounts I'll
be in fine shape for Monterey in August!

Thanks again,

Rich Freitas  (FreitasRJ@aol.com)
