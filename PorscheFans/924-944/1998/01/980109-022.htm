<<Cobb's comment that "the only time I want your car at 100% is at the
apex" was instructive.>>

And something I do not understand at all. Can you explain what he might
mean by this?

<<Something that's rarely done at Drivers Ed ( and I understand why) is
occasionally putting less experienced drivers in with an advanced group.
This can really help some rookies ready for the next step.  I've seen
their
times drop considerably after one session just by have to pick up the
pace
and following the lines of experienced drivers.  It's also a good
exercise
in humility that is essential for advancing to the next level.>>

I'd recommend taking a ride with an instructor in lieu of getting out
there with the big dogs - you might get hurt. ;-) I try to go out with
at least one 'new' instructor at each event. The difference in technique
is astounding! 

Most drivers are heavy-handed in their technique, but I have discovered
instructors that manage to keep up with the people in more prepared cars
by being more delicate and refined in their actions. One notable example
is Don Coburn, who can make you feel totally comfortable at speed in his
bone stock 911 while wearing a 3-pt belt. 

But one word of caution: Attempting to do what someone else can do
without the car preparation and/or technique can be a very big and very
costly mistake. I followed a well-prepared and lightened 914-6 into a
corner once in my stock 951S and tried to use his braking point. Doh! At
least the ABS kept the tires from getting flatspotted and the corner had
enough room to get the car stopped in time, so it was a cheap lesson.

I feel the need for speed.
