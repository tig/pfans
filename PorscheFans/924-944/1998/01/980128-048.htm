Jon,

The info comes from a R&T road test of a Turbo S published June of '88 where
it lists 94 mph in third.

The only other magazine test in the Gold Collection that lists speeds in
gears is a R&T test of a 1986 which lists the 101 you mentioned. Both the
'88 and '89 Owner Manuals I have also show 100 mph in 3rd for the Turbo. And
yes, the gear ratios are the same in the S as the normal Turbo.

It seems the R&T test is in error! This wouldn't be the first time though
would it.  Good catch!!

Anyone got a six speed burning a hole in their garage floor?

'88 951S
'95 850R Wagon
'92 Ford Van
'98 M-Class, still on order...
See you at Monterey in '98!!!

> 968 -- 1st: 12.02  2nd: 7.56  3rd: 5.44  4th: 4.19  5th: 3.43  6th:

>3.38 -- 1st: 11.83  2nd: 6.76  3rd: 4.73  4th: 3.48  5th: 2.80

>3.89 Data:  0-30=2.0;  0-40=3.0;  0-50=4.1;  0-60=5.5; 0-70=7.1;

>0-80=9.1;
>0-100=14.1; & 1/4 mi=14.2/100

>968 --  1st: 35  2nd: 59  3rd: 83  4th: 103  5th: 128  6th: 156
>3.38 -- 1st: 37  2nd: 64  3rd: 94  4th: 130  5th: 162
>3.89 -- 1st: 33  2nd: 56  3rd: 83  4th: 113  5th: 140

>KMR confirms 968 6 speed will work in a 951, but does require a machined
