For those of you following this thread on my dead DME (brain), I have some
very interesting news.  Thanks to all who replied, I was able to form a plan
of trying to have mine repaired, while working on getting a used one too.
Thanks to Dave C. for suggesting I take it to an electronics repair facility.
I did just that, and ran it up to my local shop that has repaired my TV, VCR,
and stereo.  In less than 24 hours, he called me to say that he found two
completely cracked solder joints, and one suspect one, and had repaired them
all.  Total cost - $25.00.  I picked up the unit and dropped it off to my
mechanic, who plugged it back into the car.  My car started right up.  We shut
it off and restarted it 4 times without hesitation.  Now, he has some more
work to do to really attach the unit back where it belongs, and put the car
back together, and then test drive it, so I can't say that my problem is
solved for sure until then (hopefully tomorrow), but it looks really good
right now, since it would not start at all before.  My new best friend at the
electronics repair shop also warned that it's possible a component in the DME
might have been damaged also by the shorting out caused by the bad solder
joint, but then again - maybe not.  So I'll keep my fingers crossed and let
you know in another day or two.
