My 87 944S 96K also tends to use a lot of oil but only with higher revs. I have
 typically been going through 1 quart every 1000 miles. However, it really
depends on the way I drive. High revs = high oil consumption in this car. For
example, a couple of half hour sessions the track (Blackhawk, Chicago, Club)
and I can go through a quart or oil.

Actually, for some reason my consumption went down quite a lot since the last
time I went to the track. I drove the car hard over the great Octoberfest
weekend we had at Blackhawk. I went through a lot of oil but ever since the car
is going about 1500 miles to a quart (and my idle has improved?). Hence, my
theory of buying cars that have been tracked!

My current stance is that oil is cheap, and I believe Porsche states up to 1
quart for 700 miles.
