Michael,

To find out if the chip in your car is original or aftermarket, you must
locate, remove, and open the DME computer box or "brain". The removal
procedure applies to any 85.5 or later car. The actual Porsche chip part
number given below is specifically from an 85.5 car, and is probably
valid for all 85.5 and later US 944 2.5L NA 8-valvers.

Procedure:

1 - Disconnect the battery (important; don't want to fry anything!)

2a - On late models (85.5 and later) peel back the passenger's footwell
carpeting. It should be held in place by velcro. Underneath, you'll find
the DME. To remove the DME, there are 8 screws on two different mounting
surfaces, as I recall. In this area you will also find wood as a
material Porsche used in your car. If you know how to use a screwdriver
you'll figure it out...

2b - On early 944's (pre 85.5 changeover) the DME is located in the
driver's footwell area, to the left of the steering column. It is
attached to steel brackets in four places.

3 - Disconnect the big cable (look at it; it pries off from one end to
the other, lengthwise) and remove the metal DME box.

4 - Carefully pry back the several little tabs holding the metal box
halves together.

5 - "Open the DME like a book. Be gentle, as the ribbon cable that
connects the halves is the book's "spine".

6a - The chip in 85.5 and later cars is a 24-pin device in a removable
socket. It has a silver label on it with part number 1267355189 (P/N is
from an 85.5 chip I have in a little anti-static case). If the label
looks like anything else, it's not an OEM Porsche chip. You might be
able to figure out who makes it by the numbers on it. For instance, my
AutoThority chip for 85.5-87 944 8-valvers is AutoThority P/N
944.1.200.30.

6b - The chip in pre-85.5 cars is soldered to the board. To upgrade you
usually need to send the DME in, and it gets returned with a
daughterboard added containing a new, socketed chip.

Good Luck. I have replaced DME brain in 3 944's so far...It's easier
than replacing belts...
