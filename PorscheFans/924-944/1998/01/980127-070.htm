Folks:

    As a Florida resident, I would suggest a worst case scenario as to =
your 968 which is that it was, as a new car, unrepairable as defined by =
florida law which then required that it be re-purchased by the dealer =
and was then earmarked as a lemon.  I am an attorney, but not expert in =
these matters.  I do understand that it is not unusual for dealers who =
are forced to eat these fruity delights to send them out of state to =
avoid disclosure problems.

    I have access to a database for automotive titles and, if you want =
to call with more information, I might be able to get you some history.
