I guess, but that isn't all that bad.  I always wanted a race car when I
was growing up.  Couldn't convince my dad to help me build one though.

Must have been, which, BTW, I haven't broke a single one on my hatch lately.

David Ganapol writes in an earlier post:

>>My question is I see the mark at the rear but there is no line on the 
bell housing. I know if I move the crank just a little the mark can not
be seen. I lined it up as best I could and put the belts back and
adjusted. The engine will rotate fine (using rachet), I have not started
it as of yet.<< 

There is a much easier to view TDC reference mark located at the exact bottom
of the bell housing. It is a 1/4" window cut into forward surface of the
bellhousing that lines up with a similar groove on the flywheel. 

Here's how I find TDC:

Use a very long screwdriver in the number 1 sparkplug hole to touch the piston
as you slowly rotate the engine with a 24mm socket on the crank bolt. Be
careful here!

Use the screwdriver as a crude TDC indicator. When you get close to TDC,
remove the screwdriver from the spark plug hole, and take the plunge
underneath the car to observe the flywheel. By using a long handled ratchet,
you can observe the bottom of the bellhousing while you turn the motor over
and watch for the TDC mark.  

This method works well when the heater valve and reference sensors are
blocking topside bellhousing window. In fact I can usually line up TDC with
the screwdriver method alone (I still check it).

BTW, sometimes the balance and cam TDC marks will be a little off, just
remember that you can only get the marks within the tolerance of one belt
tooth.
