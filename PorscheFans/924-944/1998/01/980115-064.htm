Hi pfans,

Been digesting for a while now and everytime I see so much interesting
stuff passing, it's great! Love it.

First: Does anyone know how many of our beloved 924 are left of the
130.000 (?) produced in the world? Is someone keeping record of this
type of information. I know that our 914 colleagues in the US have a
register.

Yesterday I received the Automotion catalogue and I was "shocked" by the
amount of porsche parts they have! Every single detail can be bought
separately! GREAT!! Since my 924 suffers from the famous "cracked dash"
I wondered: does any of you guys has any experience with the dash cover
automotion sells? How does it look? (saw the picture and found it a bit
"plastic"-looking) Is it easy to install?

THANK YOU & KIND REGARDS
Michel,
'89 924 GOLD!
