>Automobile Magazine Announces its 1998 Automobile of the Year, The Porsche
>Boxster, at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit
>
>DETROIT, Jan. 7 /PRNewswire/ -- Automobile
>Magazine unveiled its 1998 Automobile of the Year, the Porsche Boxster, today
>at the North American International Auto Show at Detroit's Cobo Center.  While
>presenting the trophy to Porsche executives at a press event, Automobile
>Magazine Editor and Publication Director David E. Davis, Jr. stated:
>"Automobile Magazine is a celebration of great cars -- great cars with a
>definite enthusiast skew. We evaluated some wonderful sedans and sport utility
>vehicles this year, but the Boxster turned out to be a great sports car, a
>great Porsche, and a great value for the enthusiast owner.  It's our kind of
>car!"
>
>Frederick J. Schwab, President and C.E.O. of Porsche Cars North America,
>stated: "We are extremely honored to receive Automobile Magazine's Automobile
>of the Year Award.  The fact that it is coming from such a highly regarded and
>knowledgeable source confirms our own belief that the Porsche Boxster is the
>best of the best."
>
>Automobile Magazine's Automobile of the Year Award, first awarded to the Mazda
>MX-5 Miata in 1990, is a way of recognizing and celebrating the best of the
>best among all new vehicles each year.  Other winners have been: (1991) Acura
>NSX, (1992) Cadillac Seville Touring Sedan, (1993) Chrysler Concorde/Dodge
>Intrepid/Eagle Vision, (1994) Dodge/Plymouth Neon, (1995) BMW M3, (1996) Honda
>Civic and (1997) Toyota RAV4.
>
>The Boxster, Porsche's first all-new sports car in 19 years, was introduced
>concurrently at the 1997 Detroit and Los Angeles auto shows.  Since its
>introduction, the Boxster has received both customer acceptance and praise
>from the press.  Sharing styling and engineering cues from legendary Porsche
>roadsters, the Boxster -- the name is a combination of "boxer" (for the
>engine's design) and "roadster" (for the open, two-seat layout) -- was
>developed in three-and-a-half years following its show stopping introduction
>as a styling concept at the 1993 N.A.I.A.S. in Detroit.
>
>PCNA President Fred Schwab added: "The Porsche Boxster was launched to bring
>the Porsche sports car driving experience to a wider, younger audience. It's
>an entry-level Porsche in price but, obviously, not in specification. This is
>a true Porsche, one whose heritage is directly linked to the great early
>Porsche roadsters."
>
>The 1998 trophy, by sculptor Richard Pietruska of Pasadena, California, is
>cast bronze.
>
>Automobile Magazine, a contemporary, lifestyle-oriented magazine, is a
>PRIMEDIA consumer publication.  Other PRIMEDIA titles include Seventeen, New
>York, and Chicago magazines.
