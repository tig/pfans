were coming from heater area under back of hood. tried my extinguisher I

Subject: high door handle failure rate?

Hi Gang
	Working in a VW dealer, we see that door handles do fail from time to time.
The number one cause is lack of lubrication! The door handles pivot and
linkage do need to be lubricated. I would recommend Wurth HHS-2000, or simular
lube that does not evaporate over time. The Wurth product bonds to the metal.
High friction at the pivot points causes the tempered steel to snap! 
	I remember talking to a friend of mine who was a VW/Audi/Porsche warehouse
warranty adjuster. His job was to determine if the dealer's warranty claim
would be paid be the manufacture.  He told me of a dealer in Canada that
replaced about $1/2 million Canadian dollars worth of door handles on new
cars. This dealer had the highest failure rate of any Canadian dealer. When
the manufacture a if they lube the door handles upon the PDI (pre delivery
inspection, when the dealer preps a new car) they said NO! Well the dealer had
to eat the 1/2 million worth of door handles. Since the dealer did not perform
the required prep procedure VW/AUDI denied the warranty claim! 
	Make a habit every few years or 30K miles to pull off the handles and lube
the contact linkage points and the latch mechanism. When they become hard to
operate, lube them up!

				

						Good Luck, DavidJalai@aol.com

Subject: Audi Door handles work on 944s!


But....

I have replaced 4...count em...4 door handles on my Audi in the last year
and I have never
had to replace a door handle on any of the 4 944/951's that I have owned.
Maybe thats why they are cheaper? Or are they just the exact smae part and
I have bad luck with Audi door handles?  :)


Regards
Marc
