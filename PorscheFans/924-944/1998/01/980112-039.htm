To all:

There are sources for a boot to cover the Fabcar ball joint, if just to
keep track crap out of there. There is a company that uses the name
HELP! to sell replacement part for older cars. One of the offerings is a
ball joint boot that is the correct size to cover the Fabcar ball joint.
I for get the number, just happened to run across it at the local car
parts emporium. 

I  believe that we are getting pretty close to the design parameters of 
the 944 spindle and control arm. That doe not mean we will be having a
massive number of failures. It means that tech sould be looking at areas
the owner might forget. 

Owners should conside non-destructive testing of spindles and control
arms in the off season. Your cars have many highway miles AS WELL AS
track time. You should be concerned about exceeding the life of
components, no matter where they are on the car.

As an example, 30 years ago we knew that Amearican magnesium wheels were
good for ten hard races. We would zyglo them at race 8 and again after
race 10. Not cracked at race 8, history at race 10. This is the kind of
thing you have to put in your schedule. You just can't hope that
everything will hang together. 

I heartily recommend tech sessions where cars can be inspected for
fatigue to teach owners what to look for.
