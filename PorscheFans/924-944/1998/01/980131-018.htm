By Design (888.993.2911) sold me the OEM caliper rebuild kits which include 
seals and pistons for $18 -$21 per kit (4 needed per caliper).  The 
difference in price is due to the different piston sizes.  If you're going 
to the troble of rebuilding the calipers I can't imagine why you wouldn't 
replace the pistons also.  I certainly wouldn't want to be driving a car at 
speed that the caliper rebuild job was only half done.  Check out By 
Design.  I always get the best prices on OEM parts there.

Yes.  I'll keep the list posted on my findings...

If you need to rebuild your calipers, I've found a source that quotes $75
per side for parts only.  This includes new pistons.  As my pistons are
fine (no pits, etc.), I'm trying to locate a reseal kit that costs around
$20 total.  I found another company that has seals at $12 each (4 per
caliper), but that still seems excessive compared to other makes of cars.

The problem is that Brembo USA doesn't import caliper parts (their own
words), only rotors.  I think they are seriously underestimating US demand!
 Girling and ATE have repair parts readily available (for their calipers,
not Brembo units).  Go figure!
