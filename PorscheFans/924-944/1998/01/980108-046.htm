I am not a racer, but I used to be a physics major (actually got the BA) 
and this makes a lot of sense. In a perfect car, this would not happen. 
In real life, the abrupt brake release does not give time for the weight
to transfer to the rear.  A complete analysis would probably involve
studying how the forces change on the front tires as they go from both
braking and steering to only steering.  There is a finite amount of
traction available and when some is freed up from braking it goes towards
traction.  Suddenly the front wheels stop drifting, grab on to the road
while the rear end is still light and has little traction, hence
oversteer.
