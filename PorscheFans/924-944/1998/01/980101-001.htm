Hopefully, I'm over the New Years champagne by now, if not you'll 
have fun reading this :)  That's a lot of boost you're running.  The
consensus seems to be that you can run as high as 17psi on the street
with short burts of acceleration and 14-15psi on the track with full
load running for a long period of time.  In the track case, always add
some race gas to make sure you cancel out any of the drawbacks of
bad pump fuel.

You likely have some form of boost trickery in there in addition to
the drilled cycling valve.  Perhaps you have the modified boost bolt
or a wastegate shim, but something is causing the boost to be higher.
Other problems could be an incorrectly drilled cycling valve which is
bleeding too much pressure from the intake line and not passing enough
on to the wastegate diaphragm.

That's all I need to write on the list, email me private if you need
more help sorting this out.  If it were my car, I would not run that
much boost, even as fun as I'm sure it is.  (BTW - at that boost level,
your turbo is probably past its effeciency range and producing heat
rather than air anyways)
