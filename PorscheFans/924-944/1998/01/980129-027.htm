>>I have a question concerning power differences between an 83 and an 87
944,both NA.  Both are completely stock.<<

Here are the differences that I know about:

Compression 9.3 vs. 9.6 (I could be wrong here...)
Piston design (KS vs Mahle)
Balance shaft design (early is forged one piece, late is composite and
slightly lighter)
Camshaft (late has more overlap and exhaust lift)
Fuel injectors
Connecting rod material
Engine mapping
Certain oil system parts

IMHO the only significant performance differences would be the cam,
compression, and engine mapping. 
 
I have found pretty significant (for 150HP engines) seat of the pants
differences between cars/engines not necessarily in line with published
horsepower numbers. Production differences, previous service (maybe a head
gasket/head milling in the past) and catalytic converter degradation may play
a part in these differences.
