Wow Clark, I had no idea there were so many differences during the
production of the 944 sunroof drives.  My car was built in Oct. 84 and the
cables are permanently attached to the lifting arms.  The white
'transmission' box, where the main drive cable from the motor and each of
the liftarm cables meet, has one metal gear in it that drives both lift arm
cables by meshing directly with the cable wrap.  It's too bad that they
changed it so often.  This early design seems pretty robust; mine lasted
for about 160K miles before one of the lift arm cables broke (within the
lift arm box) and that's with a lot of use here in south FL.  I think a
little regular maintenance in the way of adding fresh grease to the lift
arm boxes would have helped since the original lube was completely dried
out and ineffective.  The factory manual says something to the effect that
a properly adjusted and aligned cable/lift arm assy should be able to be
actuated by hand (with main drive cable disconnected from motor track;
pushing and pulling the cable by hand).  When I first tried this after
installing the (used) replacement cable, it was extremely difficult to
move.  After lubricating with grease it could be easily opened and closed
by hand; far less stress on the cables and gear.
