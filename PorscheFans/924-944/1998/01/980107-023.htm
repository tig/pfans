Sounds like gloating to me, Todd.  Another datapoint. My guides had 1/8
inch grooves at 45K miles, and I use synthetic oil too.  I've got white
guides on my '89 -- maybe the orange guides are tougher?

I keep hearing about running 944s over full oil capacity.  I was tutored
that this eventually blows oil seals.  Is there something particularly
strong about the 944 seals that allows us to get away with this?  I also
heard that it's OK for the track, but not recommended for street driving.
