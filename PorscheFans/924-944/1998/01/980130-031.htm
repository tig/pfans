The data on the 3.89 looks about right (very slightly high) to me as gear
ratios for 1 through 5 on the 944S are the same as on the 951, but the
final drive ratio of the 944 (3.889).  My experience is for stock 15" with
stock tire sizes (215/60/15).

You question is well put.  Do you want quick acceleration or to use your
944 as a GT and enjoy quiet highway cruising?  60mph on 5th gear is about
3000rpm.  Consequently, the car is noisier than the slow-revving turbo
which does if I remember well 73mph on 5th gear at 3000rpm.  The 944 in
general (IMHO) is much quieter for long cruises than most 911 examples I
have been in, but the 3.375 would make it even quieter.

As far as playing is concerned, on the 944S with the 3.889, 4th gear a
great gear to play with at 80mph (~4000rpm). To be able to play on 5th
gear, you have to be going at least 100mph (again ~4000rpm).  This should
also work on the 951 with a 3.889 as by then the boost will be good and
ready to deliver.  If that is what you want, a 3.889 is for you.  Just do
not use the 944S ring and pinion, they cannot handle the power of the 951. 

The numbers 3.889 and 3.375 come from the Technical Specs book.
