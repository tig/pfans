WOW-
	where do i sign up, sounds like the answer to all of my recent 
prayers!!!  while i was at work (common theme on this list) i was 
thinking about the car and how a series of technical videos would be 
a great thing...then i wondered if maybe PCNA would get 
involved...after all there are what about 1100+ of us and i figure 
that is quite a few water cooled P-Cars.....it would be of benifit to 
them (i am sure they would want a percent of the profit) but they 
certainly know where the mechanics are...for that matter maybe a call 
to the head of the PCA would net you information on PCA members who 
were certified P-Car mechanics....i figure there must be a way to 
make it profit enough to pay the people for their time without the 
vidoes costing a small fortune....at any rate for the law stuff, 
there would have to be a small (written or verbal) warning at the 
beginning stating that XXX in no way says that this is the way to do 
anything and that everything you see is a suggestion you may or may 
not want to follow...i.e. viewer discretion is advised....i say that 
for less than 20$ per episode you can count me and about 4 other 
people i know in.....show me the engine rebuild, the transmission 
removal...the interior removal...how to make that dam* rear glass 
look even across the back....for that matter just show me how to get 
the GD lower front spoiler that some PO ASS**** hit against a curb so 
hard i am going to have to melt part to even begin to find the bolt 
holding it in!!!!

matt
