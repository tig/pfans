Hi all,

Over the years we have found most of the sources for leaks in the
924/944/968. 

The primary cause for leaks on the passenger side are holes in the area
of the battery box caused by battery acid. Battery acid is one thing the
electro-plated steel doe not resist. Water can enter there and will go
to the lowest point of the body, the rear passenger well.

Leakes in the cowl area can also be caused by alarm installations, holes
for wires and body damage from collisions. 

If you aren't sure about the roof drains, a squirt bottle with a tube
into the drain can be used to see if the water exits in the normal
locations. The front tubes go down the windshield posts to the cowl
area. The rears go back to the compartments on each side of the rear
wheelwell. The rear tubes go through the body to the outside of the car.
Rubber gromments are used to keep the seal to the outside world.
These tubes have been known to crack over time and leak. 

The sunroof seals are designed to keep as much water out as possible.
The inner seal is to keep the remainder out and diverted to the drain
tubes. If the inner seal cracks, a leak can occur at this point. The
seal can be replaced or resealed at that point with some RTV, your call.

The rear hatch seal shrinks over time. This one is important as when it
shrinks, it can allow exhaust to be drawn in. If it is leaking water,
the principle areas to look at are the fit on the roof sails. The hatch
can be adjusted, but that should only be as a last resort. If you are
getting water in the spare tire well, then look at the drain tubes from
the hatch latch pins and see if they are routed correctly or
disconnected. Many of the 924/944/968 family that have had bodywork or
damage repairs at the rear of the car have leaks because the body shop
never put the tubes back in correctly.

Leaks at the tail light assemblies can be caused by the weather strip
drying out and allowing water in around the outer perimeter of the
assembly. The light assemblies are made up of panels which are glued in
place. The glue or seam can fracutre over time and allow water in.
Either replace the assembly or figure out which panel is leacking and
used a solvent type plastic glue to rebond the panel.

This is not an All-inclusive list but does cover most areas that leak.
My own 944 had an alarm system installed. They drilled a hole in the
cowl next to the battery to fish the wire through to the passenger
compartment. The guy did use a grommet, but did not seal the hole. I
fixed the problem by removing the alarm and wires and sealing the hole
with a product called "Dum-Dum" the body shops use to seal firewalls and
around light assemblies. This ok for drilled holes.
Rust or corrosion in the battery area should be welded or you might get
away with a foam or fiberglass repair. But it will still corrode unless
the panel is replaced.
