Howdy,

I wanted give my email address fkassam@direct.ca in case you are trying to
reach me through the web digest.

Secondly, how does March sound for the Washington/B.C. auto-x event for
944 and DSM owners?

This event has become a tradition as it is now going into its 3rd year.
This year, I'm expecting quite a few participants.  Some of the DSM crowd
have spent several thousands to be 1st in this little get-together, and
I expect nothing less this year.

The event was originally a shootout between myself, Paul and Roger Hanson
of Boeing, all who owned Talons.  The first year, he beat me and Paul, last
year I beat him and Paul with my 944T.  Last year, we had a turnout of about
10 cars, 5 944T's and five DSM's.

I already have the following people confirmed for coming:

Driver              Car            Location
Farzaan Kassam      89 944T        B.C.
Paul Buchmann       89 944T        B.C.
Mark Buchmann       87 944T        B.C.
Darren Foo          89 944T        B.C.
Lou Grouzolier      89 944T        B.C.
Tim Stark           88 944TS       B.C.
Tom Pultz           90 944S2       WA
Tom's son hopefully 89 944T        WA
Roger Hanson        91 Talon AWD   WA
Derek Wang          95 Talon AWD   WA
Travis Burnside     91 Talon AWD   ID
Gregory Carlson     94 Talon AWD   WA
James Lawler        90 Talon AWD   B.C. (previous Canadian National champ)

That's all I have right now.  Tom and his son have not confirmed, but I am
going to set the dates around his son's schedule because I want him to bring
the beast out :)  I have not confirmed the dates with Wes yet, but I'm
sure he'll make the treck down.

The format is going to be simple, you have to own either a DSM or a 944.
You don't have to be a member of the list.  We will run with the Porsche
club or the WWSCC, both which will likely let us run with them.  You are
likely to get 3-5 runs, of which the first 3 count towards the trophies.
The race site is going to be Bremerton, anything smaller is no fun for the
turbos.  This site allows us to equalize a bit with the S2's and other NA
models.  Hopefully, Bill Buetow doesn't read this email or he'll be #1 for
sure :)

Once I know how many people we have, I'm going to get enough trophies or
other prizes so that no one goes home empty.  I've always wanted to run
an auto-x like that, but can't afford it for 80+ people.  With 10-20, we
can afford it.

All money paid for entry will go the hosting club, I will not be making any
money from this, nor do I want to.  We are using the club's facility, we
are using the club's insurance and they are being gracious enough to let us
run alongside their event.  The least we can do is give them the money.

If you are interested in attending, let me know.  After the event, I will
whip up a little 4 page newsletter and mail it to all participants with
pictures and all for a good keepsake of the event.

If the event goes well, I'll start planning for a track day with the same
crowd at Spokane, an ultra-high speed track that is relatively inexpensive
to rent out thanks to a good friend in that area.

Farzaan.
