Hi all,

While I currently believe that the 944 block has liners, I'll take some time
trying to get information from either Porsche or KS to see if the block is made
completely of the AlSi alloy or not.

My reasons for believing that the block uses liners are:

-The 944 blocks themselves have a slight separation in the cylinder tops, as if
there is a liner installed in the block.

-Liners or inserts are available from KS to "re-new" the block.  These liners
are currently used by KS to manufacturer aluminum blocks.  KS casts the blocks
around the liners, providing a better bonding and seal to the liners than
boring and installing.

-AlSi is not needed for the whole block, only for the cylinders.


I'll try to keep people updated.  If the 944 block is a complete Alusil
product, then I'll let the list know (and I'll admit I'm wrong about the
liners).

Regardless of what the block is, KS does and can provide liners with the same
bore dimensions of the 944 block that can be installed into the block.  This
may provide a better alternative to cast iron sleeves or overboring.  Whether
or not it is a cost effective method of redoing a whole block is another
matter.  It may be cheaper to overbore and find oversize pistons.
