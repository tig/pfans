>Marv's Virtual Used Parts Rental Program

I'm not saying that the Program doesn't have promise, but I'd like to be
clear on a few points.  Can you guarantee a virtual increase in power and
acceleration with these virtual performance modifications? And will I be
virtually pleased and thrilled at the improvement?  More importantly, will
I have a virtual improvement in lap times.  Will the Program provide
official virtual certification accepted by PCA officials that lap times
were indeed faster?  If so, my virtual check arrived yesterday for
GT3-level performance parts.  When can I expect to see the virtual
improvments?
