Hi all,
I asked my machanic a while ago about using the same O2 line, but just
change the O2 sensor wires.  He said that the O2 sensor wires are VERY
sensitive in reading the electrical charges.  So sensitive in fact that if
I alter the length of the overall sensor, it will throw readings off.  He
said to go with OE $100+ O2 sensors.  I had no money, so I didn't.  

Seems to me that if what my machanic is saying is true, Bosch wouldn't even
bother to make an Universal Sensor, right?  Is this Uni-Sensor so new that
my machanic doens't know about it, or am I being BSed?

Thanks In Advance,
tony

>>>Just bought the new O2 sensor. Its even easier to install than I had figu=
red. Bosch makes a universal sensor, cost US$24.95. All you do is cut the=
 old one off, remove some insulation, slide the wire into a metal sleeve =
and crimp it. Then slide the heat tube over the metal sleeve and heat shr=
ink it. Your done.

>>>I got it at Autozone. They pulled up the 944 on the computer. Two sensor=
s were listed. The OE one which is the same but has the complete lead and=
 connector was not in stock. This is the one that you can get from Automo=
tion for $198. Carquest had this one for $75. The second one was listed =
as universal. Made by Bosch in Germany, assembled in US.
