Thanks to all who responded to my query. Reason has prevailed, and I will
let a highly reliable pro rebuild the motor.

his garage)

 coming from where the oil pan meets the block.  >>

Andrew,
When I first bought my car, that was one of the two findings of the pre-buy
insection and was the first thing I had fixed.  It's a 12 hour job.  If I had
to do it now, I'ld first get a baffled oil pan (I think stock on Turbo S's) to
put back in, I saw one in Pano for $100.

<< Did you recently replace your radiator, any
 suggestions?
 thanks
 Bart >>

Yea, I did actually.  Replace your radiator mount bushings.  The radiator is
supported by 4 rubber bushings.  2 sit in the tray under the radiator.  The
radiator sits on these to bushings.  The upper bushings have a washer in them.
A bolt screws downward through the shelf/tray/whatever over the radiator and
the tip rests in the hole in the washer, so the washer forces the bushing
against the top of the radiator.

Long story short, or maybe longer, I was coming back from a party in a cow
pasture in Tuscaloosa no less, and the dash light up.  I pulled right over an
killed it.  .....anyway the upper bushing wore out, the washer was pressing
directly against the plastic side tank of the radiator and had cracked it.
The new radiator was TIGHT, but it was an updated part number from my radiator
(03 instead of 01) which is probably stock in yours.  The new one was the
exact same manufacturer as the original, the only difference (other than part
number) was that the new one had a deep wire wheel brush mark where the
original one said Porsche ($200 vs/ ?$350?).

It's pretty easy though, I did it in about 6 or 8 hours I think.
