Porschefan....let me be the first to offer my condolences on the death
of your brother.  It is a tragic loss, and we all feel your pain (for
the turbo).  I'm sure the authorities will understand when they question
you about his apparent suicide.  He jumped off a bridge - twice.  It
happens all the time.  So what that he had just totalled an RHD Silver
Rose.  I'm sure they'll never suspect that you would take such vengeance
on him for an accident.  Nevermind that I would, nevermind that there
were only.....36 made was it?   Nevermind that he jumped twice...I'm
sure the Karma counters are satisfied now.  

Just kidding......maybe.  :)

Bill
