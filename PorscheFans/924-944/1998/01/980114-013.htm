	The screeching you describe can be remedied by use of "100 MPH" tape.
Apply liberally to the area that the screeching is coming from. Also a
minor upgrade of Girlfriend 1.0 to 1.2 to remove unwanted movement
during high G turns. Can't recommend going to 2.0 as faults that occur
in 1.0 may not have been rectified by the factory.

From: Ken Kroslowitz
I'm puzzled. Recently, I have been experiencing a loud, screeching noise
emanating from the passenger seat area. Typically, sound occurs when
encountering extreme lateral g-forces on either right, or left hand
turns. Sounds are also emitted under extreme braking conditions. No
problem when accellerating.
While there never seems to be enough traction, road grip is good.
Understeer is noticed on sharp turns, as well as chassis roll, and
'drifting' will eventually occur on long sweepers.
Additional symptoms:
Sound is only emitted when Girlfriend 1.0 is present.
Driver experiences extreme thrashing from Girlfriend 1.0 immediately
after screeching noise stops.
Question:
Has anyone else experienced this?
Why does it occur only with Girlfriend 1.0? Should I upgrade to 2.0?
Is this a problem?(period)
First person with the correct answer (i.e.-Girlfriend 2.0's phone
number, gets Girlfriend 1.0's phone number.)
944 NA (stands for Needs  A .....Turbo, 8 more valves, dual ignition,
etc.)
