This is probably too low. Lowest generally acceptable around here is to
have the lower A-arms parallel to the ground. 

My PO did likewise with the collars (for lowest possible cg and highest
autox performance) and both arms were replaced/rebuilt before I got the
vehicle.

BTW, the M030 (aka motorsport) a-arms may be stock on your car. They're
listed as such for the '88 turbo S, so...
