You know, Richard, you just missed getting the mirrors.  There was a
blonde by here earlier, and I felt she needed her ego boosted a
little.

ure. =0A=0A=09The new 951 crossover pipe was for 1986 & 1987 M.Y. Cylinde=
rs #1 =0A& #4 had an accordin or expansion flange to allow for length wis=
e growth=0A of the headers. Also the cross over pipe was changed to allow=
 for additional =0Aexpansion. The updated parts are out linned in the Tec=
h Bulletin # 8711,=0A dated Sept 21st, 1987. The early headers were of ca=
st alluminum which did =0Anot have the expansion bellows on cyl #1 by the=
 oil filter. The early header =0Acan and do devellop cracks. As we all kn=
ow the new headers are quite =0Aexpensive at over $900 for each peice! Ou=
