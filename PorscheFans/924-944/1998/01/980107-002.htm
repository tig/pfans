	Couple of weeks ago after not using my 87 951 for a few weeks, I 
fired her up and gave her a beating. First suspicion was when a guy 
in a Thunderbird told me that there was water in my tail lights. When 
I got home I looked in the rear and found my entire "trunk" filled 
with water. Worst part is that my a/d/s/ amplifier was mounted in the 
driver side wheel well and I DID try to listen to the radio... so now 
I got a waterlogged 951 which drains its battery every nite... we 
think its moisture in the amp wiring and a fried amp. I can't keep my 
car under so I need to stop the leaking hatch. I remember several 
older posts about this problem and would appreciate any help... I 
should have paid attention!!!
