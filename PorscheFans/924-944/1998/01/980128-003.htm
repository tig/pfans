Has any one out there dealt with these problems?

My late '84 944 has 123,000 miles and is used as a daily driver, and is
autocrossed during the summer.  I've "chipped" and installed a "K&N", as
well as tweaked the airflow meter and ensured the fuel deliver system is
operating at factory specs.  Being a Sept '84 mfg date, it surprisingly had
the E-prom chip computer installed - no record of a warranty replacement of
the computer.

Cruise Control:
It was fine at 60,000 miles but by 70,000 it became intermitent, and finally
died altogether.  My mechanic suggests that it is a "chip" problem, and not
worth the trouble & bucks to fix.  I'm at a loss as to what it could likely
be - I'm dangerous with tools!  I've read that the 944 galvanized body
creates a electrical ground problem as the cars get older; i.e. poor ground
contact.  Could this be the cause of my problem, or is this just another
opportunity to remove a component to further lighten my car?


Flaky Tach:
The tach seems to be "stuck" at dead stop, but will bounce to life with a
tender thump on the dash, only to crash to dead stop.  Sometimes it will
work perfectly, and then at other times it will "work" intermitently.  The
problem seems to occur on start up and will go away as the car reaches
operating tempature with or without judicious dash thumping.   I suspect
this might be related to a loose wire or poor ground - similar to the poor
ground problem I witnessed with the fuel gauge sending unit on the top of
the fuel tank.  This problem seems to have come on since installing the
Weltmeister sways and 250lbs springs; I suspect the "stiff" ride and my
autocross events have loosened a connection.  Anyone have this problem?  Or
is it to the parts bin again?

Steering Rack:
I'm getting tired to replacing racks every 30 months because of leaks.  Any
one out there know what the fix is - and I don't mean using a Visa Gold
card!?  PCNA only offers a 24 month warranty; I suspect I could use the
money more than they, notwithstanding their need to fund the move from Reno.
Surely someone out there has come up with a "kit" that uses aftermarket
seals, and/or has figured out what the flaw is with the shafts used in the
944 rack.  I'll trade you my knowledge of how to chemically remove
annodizing from all four fuchs in one evening - and no, this has nothing to
do with using Love Canal effluent!
