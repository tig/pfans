Hi everyone,

    I decided to change the belts and rollers last weekend. I forgot 
how much pleasure it is to work on a 10 year old car (951 '87). While
looking for the mark at the rear housing I had some wires in the way. 
When I tried to move them aside the brittle plastic on a tee broke. Also
a line broke on the timed valve ($82) under the intake maniford. After
futher inspection it looks like some had broken it before (I am second
or more owner) and shoved it back in. I think I found my turbo
hesitation that I some times get. This will be another day job to
perform.

My question is I see the mark at the rear but there is no line on the 
bell housing. I know if I move the crank just a little the mark can not
be seen. I lined it up as best I could and put the belts back and
adjusted. The engine will rotate fine (using rachet), I have not started
it as of yet.

Something else, the top balance shaft mark when the belt is adjusted
will be about 1/8 inch away for the alignment mark I can not 
get it any closer.

Thanks for all the help
