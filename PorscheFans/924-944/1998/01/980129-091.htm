Joe,
     I need to clarify one point before I start. I'm sure someone has
already noticed this but, I haven't received any mail on it yet. The
balance shafts aren't actually 180 degrees out from each other, they only
appear to be 180 degrees out from each other because of the way the balance
shaft sprockets are installed on the shafts. 
    Since you're interested in hearing the explanation, here it is.  I'm
going to post it to the list as well since there may be others who want to
hear it.  For those of you who don't need to hear this or already have an
indepth knowledge of how the balance shafts work, just ignore this post. 
    First of all, the most reliable way to check the alignment of the
balance shafts is to remove the sprockets. The spockets are aligned with
the engine set to TDC. With the engine set at TDC, the woodruff key slots
on both balance shafts should face up(12 o'clock position). The balance
shaft drive gears each have two grooves for the woodruff key. One groove
has an "O" stamped beside it and the other has a "U" stamped beside it. For
the upper balance shaft, the drive gear is installed with the "O" groove on
the woodruff key. the lower is installed with the "U" groove on the
woodruff key. 
    Each balance shaft actually has two counterweights which resemble small
hockey pucks with the shaft running through them. The two counterweights
are about an 1-1/2 inches apart (or approximately 4 cm). The section of the
shaft between the counterweights is machined for the main balance shaft
bearing. If you don't want to take the balance shaft sprockets off, or
don't have a spanner to remove the sprockets, you can remove the belt and
turn the shaft by hand to tell if they are properly aligned. As we said
before, with the engine at TDC the balance shafts are aligned with the
woodruff keys on the shaft pointing up. However, with the gears installed
it can be difficult to tell if the correct groove is on the woodruff key.
If the woodruff key is up as it should be, the counterweight is centered at
the 6 o'clock position. Turn the upper balance shaft so that the "O" on the
gear is up. Then, if you turn the shaft a few degrees in either direction
(clockwise or counter-clockwise), it should feel like the shaft naturally
wants to turn back to its original position when released. If it does, the
gear is correctly installed. For the lower balance shaft the procedure is
the same except that this time it is done with the "U" facing up. This
method is somewhat of a pain. I really only used it as a verification when
I'm putting everything back together after a water pump or seal
replacement. The first two methods are only an option if you have a timing
belt tool.
      If you don't have a timing belt tool or a spanner for the sprockets,
take a heavy piece of wire and slide it into each of the grooves on the
sprocket. Obviously, the groove with the least penetration is where the
woodruff key is. Do this with the engine at TDC and you will be able to
tell if the balance shafts are properly aligned (as previously described). 
     I know this was a painfully detailed message and I really should have
described the last method first since it is the easiest. However, I don't
know how many vibration problems I've seen because the balance shaft gears
were improperly installed.
