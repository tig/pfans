Well, I finally got my '77 924 back together again after the head gasket,
and it breathes life yet again. However, after doing this, having reset the
timing and checked all vacuum lines, plugs, and wires, the engine
appears to be missing a little bit, and a little down on power. Maybe I'm
just spoiled by the Volvo I've been driving in the meantime, but it seems
that it really should be better!

I noticed that the center contact in the dist cap was in kinda rough shape,
so I tried swapping in the cap from the Volvo (same distributor!), which
was new, but there was no difference (plug wires are pretty new, not
likely the problem). Both at idle and on the road, there's a faint bit (just
enough to be noticeable) of power missing and some roughness. Can
anyone make any suggestions? Am I right in thinking this is an ignition
problem, or could it be fuel delivery? Can anyone tell me the proper
resistance on the ign. coil?

924 Registry: Still waiting? Be patient, my computer's running even
worse than my car!  I will get it sent, one of these days...

Thanks...
