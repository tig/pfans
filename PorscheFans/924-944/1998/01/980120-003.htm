Tim,

How many miles on your car? The "nasty knocking noise" on startup sounds
like it might be the hydraulic lifters. They are about as far from your
oil pump as anything in the oil circuit. If your oil pressure is not
building quickly at startup, the lifters might be getting starved for
oil until the pressure can build up.

Since the sound goes away in 10-60 seconds, and you mention seeing
erratic oil pressure readings, it's possible that you have a blockage in
one or several oil lines, oil that is sludge, a tired oil pump, worn out
lifters, or maybe all the above.

85.5 944 - Resting in Pieces
84 944 - with a 200K mile oil pump and (relatively new) lifters that
click in the first 2-3 secs of operation after sitting overnight (worse
after colder nights.)
