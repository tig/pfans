A while ago I asked about the removal of the interior heater radiator.
I was answered that the dash had to come out. (oh no!)
That was correct (nothing else expected). But it was not that difficult.

Porsche designed the car in a sort of 'module' way. Everything is very
logical and simply loosen some (6) screws and the dash is out.
The tricky part is the removal of all the dash swithes and gauges, the
steering wheel, and the middle console (1988 944). This takes time.
I've managed to repair the radiator myself. A new one should cost about
$300 !
It's a brass radiator which can be repaired with a soldering iron.
If you are precise, the radiator can be repaired fairly simple.
Took about 8 hours to remove and replace the dash with all the
accessories attatched to it.

Thanks to all who replied to my calling, specially the ones who gave me
hope telling me the radiator was the last thing to remove. :-)

Grtz, Rudy.
