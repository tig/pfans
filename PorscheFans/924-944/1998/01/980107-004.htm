It is very simple.  First remove the air bag.  Be careful, this is an 
explosive device!

There are two screws (torx) on either side of the back of the steering 
wheel that hold the bag in place.  Pull the bag forward and undo the 
connector at the bag.  Store the bag where it will not be tampered with 
and lay it facing upwards (in case of an accidental discharge).

Remove the large nut on the wheel and carefully pull the wheel off.  I 
marked the stud and the wheel with paint to insure that I put it on 
strait.

Two Phillips screws hold the black plastic plate (collar) around the 
steering column.  Get that stuff out of the way, but you do not remove 
the turn signal/wiper/cruise control stalks.

Remove the plastic bezel that surrounds the instrument cluster.  There 
are three Phillips screws to the right recessed in the vents, three that 
face upwards above the instruments, and two either side of the steering 
column also facing up.

Carefully slip the plastic bezel off exposing the instrument cluster.

There are four Phillips screws securing the cluster on.  Remove the two 
on the right and loosen the two on the left.  Slide the cluster out and 
carefully pull toward you.  You may have to tip it a bit to slide past 
the dash.

There are three ribbon type cables that connect the cluster to the wiring 
harness.  They are removed by opening the two thumb levers on either side 
of the connector.  You should mark them so you wont reassemble them in 
the wrong order.

The bulbs are the black plastic do hickies that are scattered all around 
the back of the cluster.  You can use a continuity meter to check them 
all.  Twist the back of each bulb counter clockwise to undo.

Reassembly is easy, all you have...

I'm sorry, your time has expired.  Please deposit 50 cents for another 5 
minutes.
