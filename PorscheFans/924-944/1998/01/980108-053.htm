In replying to Darren Foo's letter on a leaking hatch and fishbowl
headlights. I just went through that ordeal myself, I took the car
(86 951) to its mechanic (becoming a good friend lately!) and
he resealed my hatch and my rear wiper, but water continued
to pour in, I took it their 2 days ago and he noticed the seal around
my tailights had gone bad and water was flowing in down the back
and flooding the brake lights. So I ordered a tailight reseal kit from
Automobile Atlanta for 15.00, and 2 new tailights from don McGill
for 59.95 ea. I could have kept my old ones but they were dirty on
the inside from water sitting in them. Hope this helps...
