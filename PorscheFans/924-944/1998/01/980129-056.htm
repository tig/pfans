<< Hi I am based in the UK and I am currently considering purchasing a 1986
 registered 944 Turbo. it has done 98k miles (not sure of the Km conversion
 on that one I'm afraid) and has a full service history. I am hesitant mainly
 because of past experience with turbocharged cars blowing turbos at a
 reasonably young age. I was hoping that you may be able to draw on your
 members past experience and throw some light on how long I could expect the
 turbo system to last. Along with any other financial horror stories (or not
 as the case may be) that I could expect.
 I would appreciate any knowledge you could throw my way  >>

I purchased my '86 951 with 105k miles on it.  It now has 146+k miles (that's
40k miles of me driving it pretty hard, that's what I bought it for).  It's
been chipped to 1bar boost by the second owner.  I'm the 4th, and the 2nd is
the only guy I don't have records for so I can't say exactly when he chipped
it.  Somewhere around the 60k mile range I think.

The turbocharger is holding up fine (that said, I'm completely prepaired for a
total meltdown now !)  No problems that I can tell at all.  The only turbo
replacement work I've heard of is people upgrading to larger turbo's.
