Hi P-fans,
	Prompted by the following:

>(probably not).

As a bit of a model kit nut, having built over 30 1/24 Porsche cars
alone (not including the other 30 assorted kits, and the 30 I have yet
to start !), I feel that I can offer some advice on plastic kits, from a
European availability perspective. 

I am currently compiling a list of kits and their characteristics by
model.  When it is complete, I will post it in the general post area,
for those that are interested.
I was going to include it in this mail, but at just under a thousand
words, and still growing, I will complete and summarise before posting.

Any one that is interested, or can contribute with availability locally,
please email me directly and I will send you a complete copy when it is
complete.

Regards to all,
