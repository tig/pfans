Daniel,
     The 2.5 L engine used in your 924S and in the early 944s has a bore of
100mm and stroke of 78.9mm. The 1989 944 displacement was increased to 2.7
L by increasing the bore to 104mm. I'm not sure if Porsche cast a
completely different block or if they simply bored the existing 2.5L block
to 104mm. I do know that if you bore a 2.5 L block to 104mm it should be
sleeved. The wall thickness of the cylinders gets too thin to simply bore
and resilicon the cylinders. With the 3.0L the displacement was increased
by keeping the 104mm bore of the 2.7L and increasing the stroke to 87.8mm.
I know that the 3.0L block was a different casting than the 2.5L. As
opposed to the 2.5L, the cylinder sleeves are joined on the 3.0L and the
walls of the block itself are thinner.  I can't tell you much about the
2.7L block. I've never had one apart. Maybe someone else can help us out
here.

Hope this is helpful,
Clark Fletcher
