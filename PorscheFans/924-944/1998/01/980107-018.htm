I have a 87 944 Turbo.  When I got it they said I would need to replace
the exhaust manifold and motor mounts soon.  I have a couple of
questions:

1.  The car has 90,000 miles on it.  It has the accordian type updated
manifold (didn't that happen in 86 1/2).  How do i find where there is
an exhast leak ( I read an idea to spray down the entire manifold with
some foamy engine degreaser, then start it up and see if it blows the
degreaser away when I rev it real high).  Also, the mechanic pointed to
where the mainfold connects to the engine (it was rusted a bit) and said
almost all 944s come in with a leak there (i would think all ones with
the old style manifold).  I don't want to buy a new manifold(s), so :

a. Are the 2 manifolds (I saw a price list that had manifold 1,4 and 2,3
or somthing. So do I have to buy 1 manifol or 2 (or clarify whats
there)?

b. Is there a seal between the manifold and the engine that might have
worn out and how do I tell if it's the seal (the mechanic didn't point
to the manifold but to where it seats against the engine)?

c. What is the likelyhood of having to replace the manifold ( or
manifolds).  I thought the accordian style manifold was an UPDATED
part.  So it shouldn't have hairline fractures right (and again, please
someone give me a procedure to check, since to me it's not obvious if
there is a leak or not).

2.  The car will not boost.

a.  Will a leak in the exhaust system cause the car not to boost.  I
read about clamping off a line to the wastegate to cut the DME out of
the loop of problems, which i tried (I think I clamped the wrong line
though).  Can anyone describe what the fitting looks like the line is
attached to (i looked at the vacuum diagram and there are three lines
going into a cycling valve (i think) and one of those is out to
wastegate.

b  wouldn't  a leak in the exhaust system also cause the DME to fault (
oxygen sensor)?
     (mine doesn't fault, well the exclamation point on the dash doesn't
light up).

c.  can faulty motor mounts cause the knock sensor to fault ?


AND ONE THAT I JUST CAN NOT FIGURE OUT:
---------------------------

How do you get the codes out of the computer???  I have the haynes
manual that says:
1. Turn ignition on.
2.  depress pedal for 3 seconds, light should blink.
etc.

I assume the codes are read back through the exclamation point light on
the dash. I may have no fault codes or somthing but I hold pedal all the
way down and it never blinks, it just stays lit.

When the car is started light stays on for 2 secs or so (along with
seatbelt light) then turns off.  (I assume I have no fault codes).

Please tell me how to get the codes out of the thing, or if I am
anywhere close.  I used the procedure from the haynes electronic engine
codes manual.
