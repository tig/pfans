Hi Everyone:
            Thank you all for the information you all have provided. It 
is raining today is there is no need risking doing it wrong and then 
doing it all over again. 
           Ok, this is where I am so far (I should mention that it is 
the first time that I done this on this car or any other, but don´t 
worry I mechanically inclined...). I´ve taking all the plastic covers 
off, and I have found the timing marks on the upper and lower (after I 
was told that the was one to begin with!) balance shaft. I did not touch 
the camshaft belt because I do not have the infamous tool, and besides 
it must be correct for I have run over 6000 km after the water pump 
replacement.
         What I also have found is the mark behind the upper shaft to 
line it up with, what I am missing is the lower mark. I have found a 
little plastic tab that sticks out, about 7 o´clock from the balance 
shaft (lower), and I suspect that it must be the mark. I am doing this 
with a mirror, since I can not access the car from under. 
       I need to know where all the sets of timing marks are, and how 
the should the guide, the one that barely touches the balance shaft 
belt, should be tightened. (Even the camshaft belt timing marks, it 
can´t hurt to check.)
       Again, thank you all very, very, much!

P.C.
