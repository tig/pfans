Hey There,

Actually it's not allowed to add a rubber-sticker in the inner of the 
tire, but you can vulcanize your tire. But don't forget that there are
speed limitations for repaired tires ! 

Just ask a local tire-dealer if they can 'Reifen Vulkanisieren'.

P-fans:

There have been many notes about snow tires lately.  I bought a set of Pirelli
Winter 210s last winter and got excellent snow and dry road handling (both)
from them.  I drove my 968 coupe all winter without difficulty.

The point of this note, though, is that I stopped driving the car except on
clear days this winter (and bought a truck) because of the salt!  My car got
covered with it a few times last winter, and I felt so guilty I just couldn't
mount the snow tires this year and do it again.  Cleveland has more than its
share of the stuff, and I have to imagine that it is terrible for the car.

Has anyone on the list experienced corrosion from road salt?  I haven't seen
too many postings about rust repairs, but I would be interested in hearing
about the group's experience.
