Here's my revised tech procedure on replacing door handles:

1. Before ripping anything apart, get a new door handle and new gaskets
for the door handle. 
2. Also have some light grease handy.
3. Remove the door panel - three screws under the pocket, three more
under the armrest, one under the plastic cover in the door handle, two
under plastic caps on the outside of the door panel, and the lock knob
all need to come out. Also remove the trim piece around the inner door
handle.
4. The panel is removed from the car by gently prying out the clips
under the panel with a wide blade. It then lifts up. Note the metal
bracket behind it which fits into a slot in the door. Don't bend it.
5. Remove the door handle linkage piece. It's a little grey plastic
clip, threaded onto the end of a rod which attaches to the door handle.
It's a pain to remove. The best way is to cut it. The easiest way to
non-destructively remove it involves using a 6 1/2" pair of Channelock
pliers - grab onto the clip in such a way that one jaw of the pliers
pivots on the metal post that the clip fits on to, and rotate it off the
shaft.
6. One big screw on the side of the door holds the handle in. Remove it.
7. Grab the handle and slide it forwards, then pull the rear portion of
it out a little.
8. Using a flat blade screwdriver, pop the lock linkage piece off. It's
a white piece of plastic.
9. Put the key in the lock and leave it there. Remove the screw at the
end of the cylinder, and keep track of the order of the plates on the
end and the spring. Pull the cylinder out. Do not remove the key.
10. Clean off all the old "gunk" from the cylinder, plates, screw, and
spring. Apply new grease.
11. Reassemble the cylinder in the new door handle. Once the screw is
in, you can take the key out.
12. Put the new gaskets on the new door handle.
13. It goes in the car basically the reverse of removing it - Front part
first, then hook up the lock linkage, then the back part. Have someone
else push the rear part in while you put the screw in - it's easy to try
and crossthread it.
14. The door handle linkage clip is the adjustment for the handle. Latch
the door (on its side) and hold the clip against the metal post while
you pull the handle. If it doesn't release until the very end of the
handle travel, unscrew the clip a little to move it downwards. When
you've got it adjusted, take a tapered tool (I use small needlenose
pliers) and insert them into the top of the clip, and push hard. It
should pop onto the post.
15. Reassemble the door panel, and you're done!
