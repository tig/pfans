"Only the following?" Let's ask the question here...

We have a 2.0l I4 SOHC motor powering a roughly 2700 pound RWD sports
coupe. The major complaint is that it is underpowered. Turbocharging has
addressed this. However, there is a good chance the engine supply will be
cut off. What new motor should be fitted to a new upmarket version with
flared fenders?

I don't know about you, but none of the solutions above jumps to my mind.
What *does* jump to my mind is about a 2.8l - 3.0L V-6. *That* is the
logical motor for the 944...

Hmmm. I'm obviously not alone in this thinking. Maybe the *real* options
were: SOTA V6 vs. whatever hunk of Porsche V8 we can cut up?

>vibration behavior. Experimental and research results were not encouraging. 

No doubt ONLY with results projected to a 3.5l V6, not the raw 2.7l
results. The PRV engine was designed to power the Buick Park Avenue class
in Europe. It is hard to believe that such a motor would give "not
encouraging" noise and vibration behaviour.

How many of you NA owners out there, given the choice of, say, a 2.7l I4
such as found in the '89 944, or a 2.7l V6, would choose the four? Uh huh.

So... why did the 944 get a whomping big 4 cylinder instead of the smooth
V6 it deserves?

Americans.

The Porsche marketing people screamed the new car HAD to have a Porsche
motor. Period. Their claim was the 924 "failed" because Americans wouldn't
buy a Porsche without a real Porsche motor (an entirely separate issue that
I won't touch). They said the same applied to a new model with a
Porsche-massaged PRV V-6 (the *real* contender) - that it wouldn't sell
because it wouldn't be perceived as a "real" Porsche.

Were they right? Far from it from me to disagree with marketing folk. All
we're left with is Mr. Bott's interesting rationale for Porsche's extreme
interest in the PRV V6.

The first and only time I heard this story was at a campfire late at night
one weekend at Mosport Park about the time Porsche was running the
Rothman's cup series (944) and GM was running the Player's cup (Camaro's).
There were some visiting engineers over from Porsche in the motorhome and a
couple of GM engineers came over to see them, having first met in Germany
consulting... someone asked why Porsche was learning about V6 assembly from
GM, and the above was what was told, more or less... truth or fiction? I've
never heard another source even mention the story. You decide...

Bonne Annee...

   The car is currently running with autothority chips and no cat. Would like
to try a k-27 turbo from winward performance but don't need any extra lag.
K-27 chips would go nice with this if they were set at 1.1bar, but don't want
to cook the motor. The K&N conefilter seems to be a good idea but, isn't it
drawing warm air from the radiator and turbo area and wouldn't the cold air
from outside be better for performance? What is the story on the adjustable
fuel pressure regulator? I've been told that there is a power increase but no
data to proove it. The mass flow sensor seems like a good idea but not for 2
grand. Is there maybe a poormans answer to this , like a used sensor from a
newer 968? Tunned exhaust seem like an easy way to bump performance,but then I
read that you have to readjust the fuel mixture to run richer. Everyone I've
talked to has diffrent suggestions on how to upgrade and how their product
producess more horsepower then the other gauy. I could really use some advice
from the people that have made some or all of these modifications. Really ,
just need to know what works and what doesn't. Any help would be greatly
appreciated.
thanks
