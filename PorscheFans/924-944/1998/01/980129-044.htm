Hi, Clark,

Apparently, not all Sebring cars had the M471 option, as the one I owned
had 4-lug wheels.
Mike Fields

Please allow me to weigh in,
 
As someone responded earlier, most normally aspirated 924 models came with the
4 bolt, 14" wheel setup.  These had front disc brakes and rear drum brakes.
That's why you see comments on the list about being able to retrofit VW discs
to the rear of the 924.

The M471 added 5 bolt wheels, four wheel disc brakes, and front and rear sway
bars to the car.  I believe the na 924 with the M471 came with 5 bolt, 15"
spider web wheels.  I think all turbo models (931) came with the 5 bolt option
and I do know not all turbos had front and rear sway bars (front only).  Later
model turbos with the M471 susp. pkg. had the 16" 928 style wheels and the
sway bars.

As Mike said, the M471 susp.pkg. wasn't a function of the Sebring 924 model.
I have seen one with the four bolt pattern, too.   The Sebring had a different
paint scheme and that's about all.

Well enough for my 2 cents, have a great day.
