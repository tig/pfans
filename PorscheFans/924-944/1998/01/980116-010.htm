My '84 944 with 68k miles has an odd warm-running problem that 
I've partially diagnosed.  After warming up for about 15 minutes, 
the engine will suddenly start idling at 200rpm, and the power 
becomes very low at off-idle.  It will miss badly only at idle.
The engine will return to normal once it has cooled down completely.

Using a timing light, I found that cylinders #2 and #3 had an 
intermittent (or perhaps weak?) spark at idle, and no spark at 
off-idle.  Both cylinders were fine when the engine ran well.  
The spark at the coil looked regular, but it was difficult to 
tell because it was fast.  The timing was jumping around about 
10 degrees at idle, and it was steady at off-idle.

The plug wires measured 3k ohms end-to-end, except for #2, which 
was 2.5k.  All of the wires were in good shape externally, and I 
could detect no arcing.  Swapping the plugs had no effect.  The 
rotor/cap was in good shape; it was replaced 6k miles ago.  I put 
the plug wires in the freezer for 15 minutes, and then re-installed 
them and immediately started the car, and it still ran badly.

What other tests can I perform before I start blowing money on 
new parts? I can't swap plug wires because there's not enough 
wire length.  I can't do a spark test because the factory service
manual says it can destroy the coil and DME.

Assuming the problem is the plug wires, why would it depend on
temperature?  If the problem lies before the wires, then why 
would I see weak/no spark on just two cylinders?
