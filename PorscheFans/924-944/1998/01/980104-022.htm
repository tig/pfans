Hello all

The problem is basically that the car (1985 924 LUX) sometimes refuses =
to start. There is no spark coming from the coil at all. In the past, I =
have simply fiddled around with the various bits on the ignition system, =
leads etc. and eventually the car starts or if not, I leave it for a day =
or so and then it generally is starts.

For the past 3 or 4 days it hasn't started at all so my girlfriends =
uncle who used to work as an auto electrician had a look at the car =
today.

Using the Haynes manual he checked that all the wiring was correct and =
was eventually forced to admit he couldn't help. He then decided to =
check out the connections to the electronic spark box. With the ignition =
turnedf on, he held a test lamp from earth to the terminal on the spark =
box which goes to terminal 1 on the coil. This caused the fuel pump to =
start.

Remembering that whenever I have tried to get the car to start, if the =
pump starts it follows that there is a spark so the car will start we =
decided to reconnect the spark box and the car started first time.

Although my car now starts I know it will go again soon, does anybody =
have any ideas why the above caused the car to start, or is it just =
coincidence?

Regards.
