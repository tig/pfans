Hi guys, I went by my mechanic this morning to have him check a belt that
was noisy, and while we were looking under the hood, I noticed a fuel leak
from the main fuel line, and it was dripping right onto the intake manifold
and spark plugs. I guess I'm lucky that my car didn't burn up. I'm
wondering if the price for the repair is fair. He quoted 3 hrs. labor cause
the line goes all the way to the back, and about 220 bucks for the line and
couplers. 
Does that sound right to our resident experts?
Also, why do porsche hoses cost so damn much. A hose is a hose, or is it.
Is it all markup or are the hoses that special?
Oh well, there goes my swaybar money.
