>What is the part# for the new 993 air cutoff valve .  I would like to update
>my 1986 951.  Also where is that valve located.

The updated part number is: #993-110-337-50 (thanks to David for giving that
to me last week).  The air cutoff valve as Porsche calls it is located
next to your coolant reservoir.  It is a black cylinder with three large
hoses going into it and one vacuum line going into it.  You loosen the three
clamps, remove the vacuum hose carefully (don't tug on this line, it is
difficult to re-route).  Replace the valve and enjoy.

To test the valve's effectiveness, I removed the bottom hose, or the one
going back into the intake before the turbo, capped it off with my hand
and revved the engine to a mild 3500rpm, let off the throttle.  My stock
valve would not open, the rubber inside would do unusual things like expand
and actually fill the hole.  My Talon valve would let out the most awesome
whooshing noise (ala 962), and the new valve would open much easier under
vacuum and let out a whoosh, albeit much quieter than the Talon valve.

Farzaan.
