The world used to be a much simpler place. Now there are so many choices
I don't quite know just what to do! Such as, which kind of grease is
best on a particular bearing for a particular application? There seem to
be 3 variations all claiming (on the side of the container) to be just
the thing.

There is a yellow grease which has a fibrous body. Often says it is for
disc brake applications. In the old days this was the grease I would
have used, one step above the plain cheap stuff.

'Moly' grease. Black, no fiber, much thinner than the above and feels
slipperier. Is it really better than the above for ALL applecations?

Synthetic. Red, blue. No mention of moly in any I have seen. It would
seem to me this should be the choice. The synthetic oils are pretty
clearly the first choice for high temp severe service, why not sythetic
grease? But all those moly recommendations echo ....

What about specific applications? CV joints have lubricants sold just
for them. Is a CV joint really any different than a heavily loaded wheel
bearing? Would both benefit from using Mobil synthetic? What about
something like the pilot bearing, a little needle bearing pretty lightly
loaded? I see Dan Freedman has some of the special CV grease for sale;
what is special about that grease(s)? (Are you there Dan?)

An article in Excellence (?) a few months back said that the longevity
of CV joints had been tremendously improved by the use of some super
grease. Even if expensive, it is almost foolish to not use the best
lubricant possible. Wonder what that stuff was?

Well, now I will just set back and become educated. Thanks.

PS: A caution. Dont do a web search on 'lubricate' with children
present.
