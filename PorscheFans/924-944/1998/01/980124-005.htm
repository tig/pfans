rhode.jontemps asked about headers on the 924.

I have headers, make unknown. The only 2 other 924s which I have looked
closely at also have em. Whether they were installed because the factory
manifold cracked or for improved performance I do not know. I understand
the factory manifold, especially the early ones, broke with some
regularity. (This, I think, from one of the many excellent articles by
Jim Pasha.) I believe Mr. Pasha recommended useing the late version
manifold.

One very good reason the go with the header is the advertised price
difference (new anyway). $159 vs $350(?).

I suspect that the header BY ITSELF will not provide any performance
increase. (See: 924 Bolt-on Bonanza: Richard Holderner, European Car,
May 1996, Page   . Air filter, exhaust, valve timing changes, big throat
throttle body all fail to increase power. Ignition timing advance yields
a few hp. Results using dyno. Head is power restriction.

924 Bolt-on Bonanza: Richard Holdener, European Car, July 1996, page 43.
Cylinder head is major power limitation. Installation of Eurorace =91big
valve' head, cam and extrude honing gained 15 hp dyno at rear wheels
with stock exhaust and 21 hp with 2 =BC inch exhaust. Replacing CIS with
Weber carburetors apparent increase of power but not dyno confirmed.
Interesting table of airflow through head comparing stock and modified.)
