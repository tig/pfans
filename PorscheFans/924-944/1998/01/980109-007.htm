Thore,

Good job, Andrew!

Other interesting notes are:
Fahrzeugbrief is like our title, various owners and how long they owned   
the car.
Bemerkungen is listing of what can be on the car, say you get in an   
accident and have different tires than the ones listed, you can get in   
trouble.  Hmmm.  Ze Germans are very strict!

Hello Brian & P-Fans
	Did you check to see if the plug wires are rubbing or arcing on the 
inside of the hood? Typically the hood insulation will fall/decay/rub off 
the inside of the hood area, then the plug wires arc under load w/wet!
	Porsche sell a replacement pad, a small insulator to prevent this on 
NA 944's; part #944-556-772-01. This pad is listed in the 924/944 Parts
Book.
	Did you check the set screw that holds down the ignition rotor?

Subject: Weird problem ?

Hello all,

I'm new to this group and I would like to take the opportunity to ask to
all of you porschists if you ever
heard about my problem;

I own a 1988  944 wich has the problem that when I leave it in the
garage for more then 3 or 4 days in a row
it won't start on all 4 cilinders.
What I do at that time is; take of one connector from the Injectors and
after about 5 seconds I put it back on
and the fourth cilinder runs again.

When I leave the car for say 2 days I can start it as usual !
I have checked all the wiring that leads to the injectors and checked
the sparkplugs, ignition cables, rotor and cap.
My Porsche garage thought it might be an earthing problem so they
checked all earth cabling but it didn't help any.

Has anybody heard about this problem before on a 944?

Any help or suggestions are welcome !!!

Hello Manfred & P-Fans
	The problem you drscribe is a bad fuel pressure regulator! 
The regulator is sticking causing the fuel pressure to go sky high 
(the fuel reg is on the return side of the fuel rail, back of the rail 
by the battery), I forget why pulling off one electrical connector 
to a  injector fixes the problem but it does. REPLACE THAT
 FUEL REGULATOR! Before it leaks fuel all over the engine! 
 Don't even mess with those 3 Bar (stock is 2.5 Bar)  or higher 
regulators - you will not get more power just less throttle
 response and fuel mileage! 

	Fuel pressure regulator part #944-110-198-03, $70.
