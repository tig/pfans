Hi Everyone:
            I finally got tired of the awful vibrations and decided to 
take a look. YES, the balance shaft was misaligned, I could notice by 
the indentions, I did line them up, but I don't know how the balance 
shaft must be aligned with the rest of the engine, cylinder 1# TDC, 2#, 
etc., I would greatly appreciated if someone could tell me. 
            To the person that gave the the detailed instructions, 
thanks, but I could not find your e-mail add. to ask you directly.

=0A=0A=0AHello P-Fans=0A=0A=09Tire run out is measuring/checking the side=

Hello P-Fans

	Has anyone upgraded to use the Turbo-S motor mount SS heat shields to
 a NA or on a turbo non-S?   The Turbo-S has these nice beefy sheilds around 
the motor mounts and look like they will bolt right onto an earlier car. I
would 
think that would extend the motor mounts life span? I think the next time I
back
in there I will upgrade!  I think that the Turbo S also has a neat heat shield
for 
the steering rack too. 

			Good Luck, DavidJalai@aol.com
