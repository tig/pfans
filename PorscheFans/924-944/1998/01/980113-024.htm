Lee, since you are "parting out your 968, I wondered if I might borrow
something.  

I am restoring a 1964 356C for a customer and I can't find one silly
little item (actually, I need four of them).  Until I can get an order
in from Germany, I though you might help me.

If your car still has the original tires on it, it probably still has
the original German factory air in the tires.  If you don't might
sending me that O.E. air, I promise to return it to you as soon as I get
my shipment in from the factory.  Please ship it UPS, as if you postal
AIR-mail it to me, it might get mixed with other AIR-mail and not be
correct (no offense, but I don't want it mixed with some of that
windy-city air, it might make the car wander a bit).

Thanks in advance...Don Istook
P.S., please designate which placement (Left, right, front or rear tire)
the air was originally used.
