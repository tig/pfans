Hi Pfans...

I need a little info on interior parts/materials from you guys... Please
reply privately at aroman@gte.net to prevent clogging the listserver.

I've got an '84 944 that is my baby, and the PO left it out in the sun a
lot. Consequently, the interior is somewhat trashed, particularly the
carpeting and the seats. I'm interested in at least redoing all the
seats and the trunk mat/rear carpet section. I need a little advice.

1) Is the original tan vinyl/tan pinstripe cloth for the seats, and
original carpeting still available? If so, where, and how much money?

2) I got a quote of about $700 for labor and materials to redo both
front seats, and about $300 to redo the rear seat. Also, about $180 to
redo the rear trunk mat. Fair? Ridiculous? Any comments?

3) Any other advice? Should I just buy new stuff or nice used
components?

4) Opinions on steering wheels - does anyone have the Dino replacement
wheel, or the 930 wheel sold by AJ-USA? What do you think of them?

Thanks much,
Alex.
'84 944.

Well, just received the 250#springs, sport Koni's (front) and plastic
bushings.  Looking forward to rolling up the sleeves & digging in.  I have two
distantly related questions, one new and one old, if anyone can help shed some
light.  I want to remove the rear seat (924S) and can't find what's holding it
in.  From under the car, I see two sheet metal screws protruding from each
side a few inches outboard and above the inner seat belt bolts, but the heads
are nowhere to be found from the inside.  What am I missing?  (broad question,
but I mean just relative to the seats).  Also, can anyone point me to a
detailed description of how to R&R the torsion bars?   Thanks.  Drive funly.

Matt
