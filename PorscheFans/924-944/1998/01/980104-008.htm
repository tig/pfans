Hi all,

I would like to have your opinion about using a special spark plug cable
system on a non-turbo Porsche 924.

I discovered this spark plug cable system at an autoparts store. It
consisted of four spark plug cables without any resistance, and one cable
that replaces the factory-installed cable between the distributor and
ignition coil. This fifth cable has a small box (2.5" x 1.5") attached to
its middle.

The autoparts store gave me a demostration where the spark of two spark
plugs were compared. The plug using a normal cable connected between the
ignition coil and spark plug was quite normal in size and brightness.
However, the plug connected to that special wire (with the box) produced a
wider and brighter spark.

The store said that this special cable system produces extra horsepower,
increase mileage up to 15%, and increase acceleration. Since I was looking
around for some new cables for my 924, and I thought these special cables
will do fine.

Can you please share with me any experience you (or friends) have with this
special spark plug cable system? Do you think it will damage my distributor
and Bosch Super 4 spark plugs?

Thanks a lot,
Chor-Eng
