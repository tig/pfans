<<Jim Pasha and the on-line FAQ cover these subjects pretty well.  We
still have yet to see a catastrophic ball joint or control arm failure
on track cars here in Northern California.  Even on some pretty low
cars.  I have heard all of the scary stories from back East, I am not
yet convinced as to why they've had trouble (they claim it is because
their tracks are rougher).>>

I'd disagree with this statement based upon Farzaan's car alone. (I
don't think it has been East...) If you are wearing out the ball joints
at 65K miles it is because they are binding. Farzaan is lucky he noticed
it in time.

<<As some of you know, my wife also drives our 951 on the track.  I do
not want to have a failure which results in her crashing, or even being
scared.  In addition to the obvious reasons, I like the fact that she
enjoys AX and track driving as much as I do, so I can continue to be
funded.  Anyway, I researched the options pretty carefully when I needed
new ball joints, and I decided on the Zim's rebuilds.  Though not the
cheapest out there, they are warranted,
and Zim's is pretty reputable.  I decided against the Fabcar arms, at
least
for now because they are so expensive.  The Porsche Motorsport arms are
not
cost effective, because they have non-replaceable ball joints just lik
ethe
normal factory parts.  Recall that the arms in my '87 came from an '89,
so
they already have the stiffer (id est, higher durometer) bushings.

During my research, I spoke at length with Jon Milledge, former IMSA
endurance
champion, and Jeff Stone at Kelly-Moss Racing.  They both said that the
Fabcars were a great choice on a money is no object basis.  KMR actually
sells
'em.  But they also told me that they never experienced a catastrophic
failure.  Ever.>>

This is not what I have heard from a very reputable member of this list.
(Or I may have heard of non-catastrophic failures because someone
noticed the arm was broken. But I have definitely heard of failures.)
But the arms are definitely stronger than OEM and the ball joint is a
replaceable spherical bearing.

<<So, if someone else were paying (e.g., warranty company or race
sponsor) I'd have the Fabcars.  Until then, I will be careful about ride
height, inspect frequently, and stay off the big bumps.>>

That is the other alternative. The annual Zone 1 Watkins Glen DE
extravanganza will not allow _any_ lowered 944 that does not have
Fabcars or reinforced steel arms. I personally think this is a bit too
harsh, but there have been a _lot_ of incidents. I wore out used OEM
ball joints after 5 DE events at Bridgehampton this year, which is
definitely a balljoint eating track - right Kevin G? - so I am making
the big purchase this winter.

Once again, the issue is that the unloaded balljoint binds on lowered
cars when there is an elevation change between the loaded and unloaded
sides. This means any curb-walking, uphill turns, or downhill turns will
cause this situation to arise.

BTW, thanks for the ride height info.
