>Hello all

>Is the washer pump on the 924 a standard type? I ask because I was told 
>that my pump is broken and need to get a new one, =A330 plus VAT from a 
>dealer so I bought a universal pump from my local shop today but when
>fitting it, the pump didn't work at all.I connected a multimeter to the

Hi Simon,

Assuming that the new pump is good, which you can check by suppling 12v
direct to the connectors with the pump removed from the car, then it
sounds like you have a high resistance connection somewhere in the
supply.  If you checked the 12v supply without a load connected it's
very likely that you would see 12v at the terminals.  You must check for
12v with a load connected.  Use a 21w 12v lamp.  If this does not shine
at full brilliance then a high resistance connector joint is the most
likely cause.  Fuse 11 supplies the windscreen washers and wipers.  Do
the wipers work OK ?.  If yes, then check wiring after the fuse.  If no,
then then check fuse.  Washers should only work with wipers running.
Relay 10 (X) contols the intermittent wipe.  May be worth removing this
and checking to see if the base contacts are clean.

Good luck!
