I have found over the years that when people fill the 924/944/951 series 
automobiles up, they have a tendancy to rest the nozzle against the 
filler pipe.  This will slowly "oval" the filler pipe and thus the o-ring 
on the cap doesn't seat properly.  Check to make sure the filler pipe is 
round and this may well solve your problem.
