Hi folks,

Hope someone can shed some light on this for me, my main Porsche dealer 
(AFN !!) tells me not to worry 'they get like that' but i am !!

When my 88 944S  is left overnight or for a period of time, on startup 
there is a nasty knocking noise from the engine (possibly tappets ??)
this noise will continue for about 10-60 seconds after that the engine 
sounds fine. Does this relate to the way my oil pressure gauge 
misbehaves ? Most of the time its sat a 5 (the sender has been replaced) 
once hot it'll drop to 4(ish) only with the clutch depressed does it 
bounce to 3 the back to 4 !!? There also seem to be some twitching from 
the needle, it never moves smoothly, and seems to be at 5 more that what 
i think it should be !

Your help is required !!

thanks,

Tim.
