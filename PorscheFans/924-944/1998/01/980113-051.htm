Hi Porsche Fans,
I have noticed that a lot of visitors are going to the Chat Lounge site I
had set up recently.  Unfortunately people are going there one at a time,
missing each other by minutes.  I received a couple of suggestions through
the e-mail that said I should set up specific times for each type of model
example
911                  Monday 6-10pm eastern time
924-944          Tuesday 6-10pm eastern time
928                  Wednesday 6-10pm eastern time
914                 Thursday 6-10pm eastern time
356                  Friday   6-10pm eastern time
Boxster           Saturday 6-10pm eastern time
Maybe this would help us to get together and start talking P-cars.  If this
suggestion sounds good to you let me know and
I'll update the site with the meeting times,
Thanks again

My '95 993 has the small-size stone guard in front of the rear fenders.  I
would like to replace them with the larger style that came on the later cars.

Has anyone replaced these clear plastic guards on their 944/964/993?  Is
there anything to be careful of?  What about installing the new ones?  An
article in the June '96 issue of "Panorama" covered it in cursory detail:

Removal:  "Remove guard; warm panel responds best.  Clean with Wurth 
Citrus Solvent Degreaser #890924, then polish surface."

Installation: "Apply with warm water and small rubber squeegee"

Any words of wisdom?  I have the 993 shop manual, but it doesn't cover
this topic.
