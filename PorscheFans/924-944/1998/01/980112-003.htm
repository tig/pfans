My understanding is that the braid will trap dirt beneath it and abrade 
the Teflon inner tube.  It is very difficult to inspect the condition of 
these lines and they are replaced as a matter of course on competition 
vehicles.

I have been told that stainless steel lines offer no advantage for street 
vehicles over good condition OEM lines.  I do not know anything about the 
DOT approved versions.

It is a little like putting racing brakes on a daily driver.  You never 
get them hot enough to make effective use of them, and when cold, they 
tend to be worse than OEM.

However, none of this applies is you live and drive in Chicago.
