Folks,

This is in response to Greg Dowd's post, and the replies.
I've already added my condolences to the many already
expressed. Take a look at the recent Car and Driver to a
really outstanding feat!  There's a picture of a large
sedan leaning lengthwise up against a lamp pole -- at
about a 45 deg. angle.  How'd THAT happen???

Anyway, a year ago, after being out of the country and away
from my car for awhile, I took my S2 out in the rain, put down
too much throttle coming out of a slow turn and broke the
rear end loose.  So's I steer into the slide and the back
came out the other way -- didn't neutralize the first
steering correction.  The second slide was far more
violent than the first -- happened VERY quickly.  I
understand this is the rule.  I was lucky to be
sufficiently far from any hard (or soft animate)
objects, and I thank the various Gods for the moment of
protection.

Now my question, I've experienced mild but alarming oversteer
exiting a fairly high-speed corner (turn 4 at Laguna Seca
for those of you that have driven there) well past the apex
and with the throttle long-since engaged in a formula Ford,
and also midway through long sweepers in a kart.  What's
the dynamical story here?
