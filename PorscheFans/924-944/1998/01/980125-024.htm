I may as well back down now and take my words back on aluminum liners and
apologize to the list.  It looks like the blocks are probably complete
castings.  I've never seen a new block, but have seen used blocks that have had
rings on the cylinder decks.  If this isn't a liner separation, it must be an
imprint from the head gasket.

The boxters cylinder walls are supposedly Lokasil, which is the AlSi insert.
 The blocks are cast around this insert.
