We are testing a chip from Larry B. (he was the chief programmer at
Autothority) and Jim Conforti (if you have or know about BMWs you will know
his name).  The chips are installed in my car as we speak, but I haven't
been able to test them due to the rain.  My car has two sets of tires, but
both are R1s.  I'd prefer to not try them out in the wet with those tires.
Larry is confident that these will easily out perform his chips from
Autothority.  We will sell them in the very near future (as soon as we test
them...)  So, you may want to wait a week before buying a APE chip, because
this may be a better and less expensive chip (not a bad cobination!)
