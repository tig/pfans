As the owner of both a 944 and a 928, and living in Michigan (Ann
Arbor to be specific), I had to respond.

First, If you're not interested in spending your weekends tinkering,
forget about a 928 in the $4K-$7K range.  In fact, you should
probably forget about a 928 entirely.  They are lots of fun, but
they always need something done to them (this weekend I'm hoping
to get a new switch installed on the passenger seat).

A 944 is a possibility - but I suspect anything in that price range
either hasn't been maintained and is in need of work, or has so many
miles that it will be in need of frequent work.  My current 944
fits in that price range, and I've spent so much getting it sorted
out (not done yet!) that I could have bought a low-mileage car to
start with and paid less in the long run.

A 924 is a real possibility.  I've seen some pristine 87 and 88 924S
examples with low (30-40K) miles for around $7K - in fact I almost
bought one myself.  Mechanically, they are nearly identical to my
first 944 (87 5-sp), which in 5 years and 50K well maintained miles
never had one problem that I had to pay to fix.

Just my opinions.  Anyone else care to respond?
