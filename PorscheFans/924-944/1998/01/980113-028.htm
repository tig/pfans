Gee, I'm sorry, Don, but I'm afraid the original tires are no longer on the
car, as it has 95,000 miles, and I don't know of any OE equipment which
lasts quite that long.  Also, I'm sure that neither of the previous owners
had the foresight to have the original German factory air transferred to
the successive tires.  And, you are wrong in assuming that the car would
wander, as long as the tires have been filled with Chicago air from the
properly designated "left" and "right" pumps.

But, I do appreciate the thought, anyway.

Don,
Thanks for pointing out there are 3 bolts and not four holding the diaphram to
the wastegate.  

One question, is there a potential FOD problem here? (Foriegn Object Damage =
FOD).  I mean by using washers to shim the wastegate, it seems that something
could get throught that open space.

Thanks,
Bob
