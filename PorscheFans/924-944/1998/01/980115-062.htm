Hi all,

I know I posted this once before but..one more time.

Friend of mine & C2 owner is looking for a 944.
Must be 5 speed, under 100K miles, Clean and 85.5 or newer.
Please drop me an E-mail if you know of any cars in the NY/NJ area.

Thanks

In a message dated 98-01-15 18:40:49 EST, you write:

<<  After debating it for a while, I've decided against the
 Fabcar for various reasons and instead am focusing on the factory motorsport
 arms. >>

Please share the various reasons if you get a chance.  Seems like you'ld jump
at the Fabcar arms.  The only downside I've ever heard anybody mention is the
lack of a dust boot on the ball joint, and someone responded with a source for
dust boots that fit the Fabcar arm.

=0A=0AHey Gang=0A=0A=09Just thought I would mention how happy I am with m=
y AutoThority=0A short shift (SS) kit for my 951. I installed it 2 years =
ago and I am quite =0Apleased with the operation and short throw action! =
For those of you who=0A do not know, APE make a nice SS kit, made out of =
CNC=92d aluminum and=0A a spherical hiem bearing. The kit allows the owne=
r to reduce the shift =0Athrows by as much as 50% in each direction or a =
25% reduction in throws, =0Afore and aft and side to side. The SS kit is =
adjustable for left to right and =0Afore and aft in any 25/50% combinatio=
n. I installed the kit in a 50% =0Areduction in both directions. =0A=09Th=
e SS kit does increase the shifting effort by a small amount but is=0A ni=
cely weighted and very short throw and precise. If any of you have =0Adri=
ven a Mazda Miata, the throws are even more tightly spaced! You will=0A n=
ot be disappointed in the improved shift action! =0A=09The short shift ki=
t is simply a new linkage arm that installs where the=0A relay shaft atta=
ches to the upper part on the trans. The install takes about =0Aone hour.=
 I had a APE install it for me, it looked like a  very simple =0Ainstalla=
tion. The APE=92s SS kit is the same unit that Jason @Paragon, =0AAutomot=
ion, AutoAtlanta sell labeled as their own. The SS kit sells for =0Aunder=
 $200 and makes shifting a very sweet snick-snick from gear to gear! =0A=

Hello P-Fans=0A=09There is a procedure to test the gauges on the =9185.5 =
and instrument panel. =0ASee tech Bulletin #8604, Oct. 24th 1986. It outl=
ine how to test the Fuel,=0ACoolant,=0AOil Pressure, Voltmeter, and Speed=
o.  Here is a small portion of it.=0A=0A=09There is a small black box (2 =
inches by 3 inches) located in the engine=0A compartment, by the master c=
ylinder and a grey fabric vacuum hose runs =0Aby/over it. Remove the cove=
r and expose the 14 pole/connector. Each terminal=0A is numbered. This is=
 the testing plug connector for the instrument panel. =0A=0ATesting the C=
oolant Gauge: =0A=09=0A=09Connect the specified resistance values between=
 terminal #8 and chassis=0A ground.=0A287 Ohms for a cold (gauge needle w=
ill be at bottom hash mark ) reading. =0AThen, connect 38 Ohms;  for the =
gauge to read hot (needle will be at 1/2 way =0Apoint, no explantion ligh=
t!). =0A=09=0A=09If your gauge checks out I would check the following: lo=
ose or corroded=0A temp gauge wires at the coolant temp sensor ( located =
under the =93L=94 shaped =0Ainter cooler pipe in the middle of the engine=
 area by the #1 spark plug). Pull=0Aoff the harness and tug - real good a=
t the electrical connectors - if they=0Acome =0Aoff, attach new crimp/sol=
dered connector and recheck for swinging needle.  =0AWhile you have the g=
auge sensor wires off, check the voltage at the wire ends=0A with the eng=
ine running should be a steady  9.5 - 10.5, DC volts. Just make =0Asure t=
he voltage does not vary. If the voltage varies by more than 0.10 or=0A0.=
20=0A volts you have a bad voltage stabalzier (located on the back of the=
=0Ainstrument=0A cluster, two pin IC). =0A=09You should also check for AC=
 voltage at the battery ( across the Neg & =0APos battery posts), yes AC =
Voltage! If you  have more than a few tenths of AC =0AVoltage at the batt=
ery - the diodes in the Alternator could be bad. Stray AC =0Avoltage will=
 cause the gauges to do weird things! =0A=09I went through all of these t=
est to find that my coolant gauge problem =0Awas a bad coolant/fuel gauge=
 portion. My coolant gauge test out OK but =0Asometimes the temp needle w=
ould act screwy. I had a used coolant/fuel gauge=0A pod and installed it =
- AND it fixed my swinging coolant gauge problems. =0AMy gas gauge would =
also read Full instead of 3/4 when I fill the tank with=0A 21 gallons of =
fuel! =0A=0A=0ATesting the Coolant Temp Gauge Readings:  =0A=0A=09Remove =
the instrument panel (there are three connectors labeled, =0AA, B, & C), =
locate connector =93A=94 that plugs into the left (to the left of =0Astee=
ring wheel) lower part of the instrument panel. Remove the =93A=94 =0Acon=
nector and connect resistance to pin #3 and chassis ground, as=0A listed =
bellow:=0A=09=0A=09140 ohms  =3D  60=92C    =3D  140=92F=0A=09  50 ohms  =

=0A=09=0A=0ATesting the Oil Pressure Gauge:  =0A=0A=09Separate the 14 pin=
 connector next to the master cylinder on the =0Aengine compartment side.=
 Connect resistance between terminal #6 and =0Achassis ground. Then switc=
h the ignition on. =0A=0A=0930 ohms  =3D  1 Bar on Gauge=0A          184 =
ohms  =3D  5 Bar on Gauge=0A=0ATesting the Fuel Gauge:   =0A=0A =09Remove=
 rear carpet rug, pry up six inch round gas tank sender cover.=0A Separat=
e the fuel float connector from the cars electrical harness. =0AConnect r=
esistance between terminal #1 and terminal #3 (the connector =0Apins are =
labeled). Switch ignition to on position.=0A=0A=09 Gauge should read: =0A=
=091/4 tank    =3D  42 ohms=0A=09Full Tank =3D   3 ohms=0A=0A=0ATesting V=
oltage Meter:=0A=0A=09Remove the instrument panel (there are three connec=
tors, A, B, & C), =0Alocate connector =93C=94 that plugs into the right l=
ower part of the instrument =0Apanel. Connect a voltage meter to pin #5 (=
15 power (+), in Porsche speak, =0Aswitch when the ignition is on) and to=
 pin # 8 (ground (-) or #31 in Porsche =0Aspeak). The volt meter should d=
