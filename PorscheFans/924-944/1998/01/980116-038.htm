Mike,

 I got it at Autozone. They pulled up the 944 on the computer. Two sensor=
s were listed. The OE one which is the same but has the complete lead and=
 connector was not in stock. This is the one that you can get from Automo=
tion for $198. Carquest had this one for $75. The second one was listed =
as universal. Made by Bosch in Germany, assembled in US.

Does anyone know where I can find a detailed description of how to replace the
torsion bars on a 924S and (re)set the ride height?  I'm upgrading the
suspension for the track.  Doing the struts/front bushings, etc. is pretty
straightforward, but the rear suspension looks like more of a challenge.
Thanks.
