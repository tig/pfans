Well, I was actually thinking $1500 tops based on the phone call

It is driveable, but it hasn't been driven much.  I think the guys been
driving it around his subdivision a couple times a month.

The engine has a new top end - not sure about the quality of the work. 
Supposedly new clutch too.  I'm thinking about $2K plus the purchase
price for a daily driver - not too pretty.  Another $1K to get the body
straight - the basics; I'm not talking prize winner<g>.

Agreed, it will never be more than a $5K car.  But I figure that I could
buy a $5K 83 and still get stuck.  It's definitely a crap shoot.

That's still an option.  I'll tell you what it looks like tomorrow.

Thanx,
Patrick
