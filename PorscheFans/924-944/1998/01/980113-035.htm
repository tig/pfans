I have seen some postings lately on the Kleen Wheel system.  While they=
 do
work, there may be other ways to accomplish the task.

I have never used Kleen Wheels but have heard of some potential problem=
s
associated with them.  Knowing this, and not enjoying the weekly scrubb=
ings of
the wheels, I looked for a better solution and think it works very well=
 short
of choosing the best brake pad.

I usually wax my wheels.  This may not be novel but not many people kno=
w about
this "trick".  Waxing does a couple of things, it puts a layer of wax b=
etween
the brake dust and wheel preventing corrosion and it allows significant=
ly
easier washing when that time arises.  Not any wax will work as well as=
 the
next.

Types of waxes to stay away from would be any abrasive type wax.  What =
this wax
does and what you are trying to accomplish are not compatible.  Also st=
ay away
from any of the polymer type waxes.  Most of these contain abrasives an=
d the
ones that don't will not leave behind a significantly thick enough prot=
ective
layer.  These waxes work great on paint but not as well as on a wheel w=
ith the
environment that the wheel sees.

The best wax to use is what is called a hard paste wax.  Examples of th=
ese are
usually packaged in metal tins as opposed to plastic containers.  An ex=
ception
would be some of the waxes offered by Zymol.  Also look for waxes that =
use
Carnauba wax.  Other waxes may have a lower melting or softening point =
that is
lower than the temperatures that are seen by the wheel.
Other useful additives would be flouropolymers or acrylic blends of som=
e type.
Teflon will not help in this, or any other  application.

Put at least 3 coats of wax on the wheel.  this doesn't put more wax on=
 the
wheel but does ensure complete coverage.  Wait at least 10 minutes betw=
een
coats.

To wash the wheel, use a car wash specifically developed for automobile=
s.  Do
not use the old Ivory soap as this will remove the layer of wax that yo=
u spent
some time applying.

Any questions, e-mail me.
