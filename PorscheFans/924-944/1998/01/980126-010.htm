Back a few years when I owned a 78 924, I had the same problem.
It was easily corrected by cleaning the little rubber drain tube (in front
of the battery with the little flap) It took me a while to figure it out,
but what 
happened was the drain was clogged with just the slightest amount of
leaves,
allowing water of any sort to fill the battery tray faster than it would
drain.
The vent for the fresh air was really low in conjuction with the battery
tray,
and as soon as the water level reached that height, it will flood into the
passenger
footwell.
Had the same problem with my Golf!

Hope this solves the problem,
                Percy.
