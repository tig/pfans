 Since there has been alot of talk on the group about car envy, all I can say
is it never goes away!  When I was a Junior and Senior in High School I was the
only kid that drove a Hot Rod.
it was my first car purchase that I spent every weekend in the garage working
on til it was just the way I wanted it (Huge meats on the back, 1/4 race cam,
tri-power induction, 9" Posi)
but then you get the idea:-)  When ever the teachers saw me in it thay asked if
my Mom&Dad
GAVE it to me for my Birthday.  When I said "NO! I bought it and built it" I
received the look of
"sure ya did."  Now, Im out of school (All Hail to Old Purdue!!) and a Computer
Tech. Greatly
apprecieated by my employer.  However,... that doesnt change things.  I still
get the old "So,
where did you get the loan for that kind of car?"  I dont explain to them I
paid cash, just cuz
I dont think it would go over too well. That, and I dont think I would ever get
another raise.
   All Im saying is it might get better over the years, but it wont go away. 
Some people cant get 
over the good habits of others.  And then you do what I do- on casual Friday
wear your best
Porsche Sweatshirt and spend the night before touching her up!!

 good luck driving:-)
