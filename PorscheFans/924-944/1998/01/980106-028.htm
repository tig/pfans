OK, you asked for input, so here goes:

John, reading your post was like deja-vu - "been there - done that". 

My first, most important piece of advice is this (just my $.02 to
protect both your sanity and your pocketbook)- decide on *what* you want
to do with the car! Do you want it for street use only? Track it? Is
reliability your first priority or is "the need for speed" top on the
agenda? These are questions you need to deal with first, before spending
the first dollar (subsequent $'s follow way too fast :-).

After deciding what *you* want to do to the car - and *why* your doing
it, then take a look at what need to be done to each major system in the
car (including the driver, in my case :-).  For example, the suspension
is a system, and while you stated that you'll leave that *stock*, are
you really going to be satisfied with power gains without a way to
deliver it to the ground?

And if you go with improved components in/on the engine (Stage 1,
Throttle body, etc.) are the other systems matched to take advantage of
the upgrade? If not, don't just bolt this stuff on - it'll effect
reliability and will never deliver the performance. Bottom line on my
*soap box* ramble is that ALL the engine systems (intake/fuel/exhaust,
etc.) must be balanced to achieve the desired effects of the single
components installed. But again, this stuff should only be installed
knowing what you want from the final product.. For example, while you
asked for exhaust recommendations - "Bursch or Borla" each have
different flow and extraction characteristics.  Which components you
have installed in front of either of these will tell you which is best. 
(Off my soapbox...)

Anyway, yep, I too have been guilty of all the stuff I'm preaching about
- but I regained my sanity as my funds were depleted and reliability &
driveability suffered.  I took a much more thoughtful approach with both
my 911 track car and current 86 951 mods. - and in both cases, they do
what I want them to do when I want them to do it... 

BTW: I *REALLY* don't mean to come accross as a jerk, so sorry if this
reads poorly. I just wish someone had said the same to me a while back
(many years & thousands of $ ago :-).... Keep us posted with what you
decide you want the car to be.  Maybe then, I for one, could help you
out with what has worked and hasn't on my cars...

Best,
John Dunkle

<< Cool. 
 Where did you buy the kit and for how much? 
 And did you have to hack the strut to fit the collars? 
 Likewise, did you have to hack the tower to fit the plate?

Doug,
I got it from Ground Control. I don't have the number on me, but can get it if
you want.  It was a total of $460 including shipping for colars, springs, and
plates.  It's a bolt in, no modification required.  the colar slides right
over the strut, and the plate bolts right in.  You do end up with SAE
fasteners though, kind of anoying, but what the heck.  The good part is, the
springs are not pre-compressed, so you can pull them w/out a spring
compressor.
