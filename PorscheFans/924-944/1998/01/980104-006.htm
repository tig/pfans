This is not a  flame, Lee, but just my 2 cents worth... Auto Atlanta is
pretty upfront about their return policy, and all in all I think it is
pretty fair.   And altho I am in no position to comment on Lee's dealings
with them, I can say that I thought they have treated me very well when I
have talked/ordered with them.  Their prices seem to be reasonable, and
altho I am sure George and company are probably turning a fair profit, this
a niche market, and we have a fairly limited number of resources to turn to.

Speaking of Auto Atlanta, they told my wife, who called in around Christmas
to order a gift for yours truly, that they were having some problems with
Porsche over the use of what I am assuming to be Porsche trademark items...
forcing them to discontinue some shirts that sport the Porsche badge, and
not display Porsche automobiles on the cover of their catalogs.  I am
curious about this after having watched Harley Davidson trash their vendor
relations thru overzealous enforcement of their logo over the years, and I
am wondering if Porsche is embarking on the same path.  I hope not....  I
have no problem with Porsche wanting to protect their assets, but I hope it
takes a slightly different tact than H-D.  Most of the bikers I know hate
"Trademark Willie" and H-D corporate (who seem more interested in selling
t-shirts and raising their stock value than catering to its customers).
Judging from the various attitudes I have seen from Porsche owners, it looks
like the relationship is already straining...

We win if we can all pull together in support of our sport... vendors and
customers alike.  We have to support each other.
