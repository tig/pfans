Hello:
   The sprockets were never taken off, so this could not be the cause. I 
insist that the marks may be wrong. I should remind you that before the 
water pump was replaced the engine ran perfectly. I suspect that the 
balance shafts were timed with another reference, of course the question 
of which one?
    Also, can it be that the shafts themselves are bad, the engine ran 
over 6000 km with the bad timing. What actually does the shaft do, where 
does it go to, what does it turn? Can it be that it is not fulfilling 
its purpose? Thanks.

P.C.

 You can mount an amplifier in the passenger-feet-area.There's
 enough place for even big amps.There is a board,where you can fix the amp
 on.The carpet covers the amp. >>


No problem with the english.  I have trouble myself sometimes.  Just for
informational purposes, don't forget that your brain is directly under that
board you're mounting the amp to.

<< cleaned the boards and contacts with some Bosh
 cleaner for the job and now it is fine. You could have corrosions on the
 connector etc.. >>

Yes,  I forgot to mention clean the contacts as your first step.  This may
solve your problem.
