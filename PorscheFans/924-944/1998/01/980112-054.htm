The later cars have power door locks that are activated by a small 
microswitch that clips on to the top of the lock cylinder in the door 
handle.  The switch has a little white nylon 'nub' that is moved by a 
groove on the lock cylinder.  This piece tends to wear to the point of 
not being moved enough to trigger the door lock motors.  You may also 
experience false alarms from the factory unit since the switch is not 
triggered, yet the door unlocks mechanically - it thinks someone is 
breaking in.

I fixed mine by unclipping the switch and carefully filing the plastic
base of the switch where it fits to the lock cylinder, thus forcing the
nylon 'nub' closer into the groove.  This repair has lasted almost two
years. Or you can replace the switch.
