What could cause starter NOT to engage sometimes? replaced ign. switch,
cleaned all wires & connectors, new battery, there is a delay sometimes
when turning key all the way to right to start. doesn`t matter if hot or
cold engine. Also, gauges erratic(temp/fuel/ & bar gage), when turning
on htr fan, rr defog, emerg. lites. Pulling my hair out trying to fix
these glitches!! HELP!!  Also in need of neut. start switch. btw--Santa
brought me a new Blauplunt Malibu,, guess I was a good little boy last
year, huh?  sounds great too.  Tnx for any help on above.

Regards & Happy Motoring--Larry,,#1.`80 924 auto. n/a, grn, starts
usually, needs some TLC, #2.`96 Sonoma Super-cab (tow-truck occasionally
and parts-getter)

For those of you that inquired about using braided stainless brake lines I
will give you a quick synopsis, to the best of my recollection, of an
extensive discussion we had when this group was called Porschephiles.
It seems that allot of people, many who are not taking their cars to the
track, have installed braided stainless steel brake lines because they thought
it would improve their pedal feel or they just thought it was an inexpensive
modification that made their cars seem racier. Most people thought you can
install these items and forget about them. Most people get away with this
philosophy but it is not necessarily true.
Using parts designed for racing usually means that you have an item that
requires race car maintenance. This means frequent inspection and replacement
at the first sign of trouble. This is food for thought. When I was in charge
of teching cars for track events for RTR region myself and my team found quite
a few cases of unsafe stainless steel brake lines. They presented as twisted,
chaffed, or were separating themselves at the connections. We had 2 fairly
serious incidents, over 2 years, of brake failure due to the failure of these
lines. It seems that many of these items were installed improperly (for
instance twisted) or were of questionable quality. True race cars and those
that are used for racing and street need these items inspected regularly and
replaced. Many race teams replace these lines on a regular item as a routine
maintenance item. They just cannot be taken for granted. You may get away with
it but the downside is not pretty.
The consensus of the group (not just myself) was that in the majority of
instances you were better off with factory brake lines that were in good
condition. If in good condition the pedal feel will not be appreciable
different from the braided lines and they are safer. It is also easier to
inspect factory lines because small cracks in the rubber are easily spotted.
It's real hard to see the rubber lines underneath the stainless braid on the
braided lines. 
I am aware that we now have DOT approved after market lines but I cannot
comment on those since I have no experience with them.
If anyone remembers that discussion feel free to jump in and correct me if I
am being inaccurate. 
Nuff said, 
Jerry

Hi Dan,
	I still think the most common cause is the fuel pressure regulator! For the
same reason you mentioned, the fuel pressure regulator fails and blocks the
fuel return line side of the fuel rail. The injectors draw too much current
because of the higher fuel pressure, and cannot flow or move that higher
amount of fuel flow under a higher pressure. When you pull one injector
connector off, the ECU can now pulse three injectors with the current draw of
four injectors!

	Just my two cents worth. In the shops I have worked in the fuel pressure
regulator is the most common cause of this senerio. All of the causes you
mentioned do apply - it's just that they are not quite as common as a failed
fuel pressure regulator.

What is an "acceptable" level of engine vibration at idle?  My '86 944T is
especially rough on a cold start, but even when warm, is never really smooth.
I suspected motor mounts, had one replaced (mechanic says the other is okay),
but problem persists.  Everything's fine above idle.  I realize a big in-line
4 will be somewhat rough; am I expecting too much?
Any thoughts welcome.

TIA,
