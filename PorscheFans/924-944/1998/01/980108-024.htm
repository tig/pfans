Also, Roxanne, you might check the gasketing surrounding the lens assembly.
If the assemblies have ever been removed in the past, some of the gasketing
might have been torn or lost in the process.  You might wish to remove the
assemblies, use a hair dryer (I'm sure you have one of those around) to get
all the moisture out, and, after re-installing the assemblies, apply some
silicone caulking material to seal up the gaps between the assemblies and
the body.  When it rains, even if your drains are working properly, water
will still flow down the smooth skin of the body under the spoiler and find
its way into minute openings.  I have to resist any comment at this time on
the last two sentences in Dan's 2nd item (BTW, we're all still anxiously
awaiting your pix).
