Stupid question, but what is mylar? TIA

>>Also, this car has the annoying habit of spilling modest amounts of fuel out
the filler neck during auto-x only. (even though tank is only 1/4 full at 
event) I have checked the gasket on the cap, and even added a second O ring to
no avail. I know of 1 other 951 that has the exact same problem-he bought a 
new gas cap and it did not help a bit... <<

The fuel filler leakage you are concerned about is pretty common. It is
actually due to an elongated fuel filler neck caused from leaning the fuel
nozzle on the filler neck when fueling. The filler neck is is an aluminum
piece that can easily deform. I always hold the fuel hose when I gas up my
street car and put minimum pressure on the contact point of the filler
neck/nozzle.

I have never had any luck bending the filler neck concentric after it's been
bent. I would contact those suppliers on the list that are purveyors of used P
car parts and explain to them what your looking for. Ask them to make sure
that the one they send you is not bent and is concentric at the seal area.

This seems to be a bigger problem on early cars, even up to and including
1986. The later cars seem for some reason to be more resistant to the problem.

The bypass valve that's getting so much attention here is what the 951 should
have come with originally. Us 951 guys share the plastic valve with SAAB
turbo's and  Audi turbo's.   I think Porsche was feeling guilty about putting
a part with such a high failure rate on a $100K car. It is also a much bigger
job replacing this valve on a 993 TT.   

By giving the stock valve the blow/suck test (don't tell my wife), I end up
replacing this valve on almost every 951 I work on. I even bring two of these
things to the track with me. If you run anything but the stock L Jetronic
airflow sensor (Mass Flow, MoTec,etc)  the loss in bottom end power and
throttle response is significant when this valve fails. This has something to
do with the one way valve aspect of the Jetronic barn door sensor inhibiting
overboost flowback to atmosphere.   

Good luck,
