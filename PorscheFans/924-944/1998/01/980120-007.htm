Jeff,
       Sometimes it is impossible to tell if the DME control unit has
gotten wet without removing it and pulling the cover off. Even then it is
sometimes not very obvious. When water first started to leak into my
passenger footwell, it got into the cable run for the DME and run straight
into the control box. I went through several cycles of this when it rained
before the DME finally failed. When I pulled the DME out, and removed the
cover, there was no water inside. However, there was a faintly visible
water line on the inside cover of the box. Also, there was some slight
discoloration on several areas of the printed circuit boards. All this
happened before I knew about the problems with the battery trays on the
944s. Additionally, the was never any sign of water in the passenger
footwell. The carpet was never wet - - - nothing.  Based on your original
message, I told you it sounded like the DME relay. However, before you
replace the DME relay, you should do a very close inspection of the battery
tray.  I would probably remove the control unit and pull the cover for an
inspection as well.

Keep us updated,
Clark
