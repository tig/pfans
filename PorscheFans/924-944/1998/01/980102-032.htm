I think the bill you are referring to is perhaps not addressed to the
vehicles you think it is.

No doubt we're talking *trucks* here, you know, the kind with the
bodies/frames jacked in the air for greater off-road ground clearance (and
higher cg!), and huge tires.

The problem is trucks and SUV's don't have the same bumper height
restrictions as cars do. Raise a pick-up truck's rear step bumper 5" and
see where it would hit your car... the recent popularity of SUV's has made
the situation much worse and some lawmakers have (obviously) been spurred
into action.
