Hello all,

I've been having a really great time reading about everyone's adventures

in P-car Land.  Now I have a of  couple of items.  First, I have a
complete set of Project 924 articles from european car magazine.  Many
of them are photocopies, which means some of the pictures are pretty
much worthless, but the text is all there.  Drop me a line off-list if
you need anything from the series.

Second thing is a cry for help from a crippled '79 924.  I have had an
electrical problem for some time.  If I charge the battery up, I can
drive about 100 miles in the day time, and about half way back after
dark, i.e. until the battery is discharged.  I have changed the battery
and had the alternator rebuilt, but now the battery is flat, even after
driving the car about 30 min.  It was a rainy day, so I had the lights
and defrost on, and the car sat for a couple of days, but the car
started fine after I parked it in my garage.  I had a voltmeter
connected throughout the drive, and it showed 13 - 14 volts even at a
warm idle.  It showed less than a half volt difference between nothing
on, engine running, and all accessories (headlights, defrost, radio)
on.  1.) How can I check the amperage with the alternator on the car (I
don't want to go through the remove and install drill again, if I can
help it).  2.)  Any ideas about what might be wrong, and how can I check

it?  Poor Franz is feeling very depressed because he hasn't gotten out
nearly enough lately.
