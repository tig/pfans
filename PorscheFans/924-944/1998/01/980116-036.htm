The glow means that your alternator is not producing enough power for your
load, so the question is your load too high or your alternator to low.

1. If your car is standard, then in most cases the brushes on your
alternator are down to the end of their life, they get consumed normally.
Nice thing is that on early cars they are field replaceable, check with you
local alternator rebuild or service group, should run about $15, and you pop
off the air box, and you can reach them.
2. Second alternative is you belt is lose, not cam shaft belt but the lower
ones, check to see it is correctly set.

It may just be that the technical people have found a way to distract
themselves by using E-mail as a form of emotional release from the day to
day interaction with computers. Which means in CYA jargon YES

	PFs,

	Once in a while, when I crank up my early 85 944, the battery light
glows.  If
	I just touch the throttle, it disappears, never to return.  Is this
a normal
	event?  It usually happens in cold evenings,

	Also, I notice quite a number of us are employed in the technical
arena.
	Should I dismiss this as coincidence?... or do I spend too much time
on my
	system, not doing the work I'm paid to do?

	Please advise,

	Dunke,
	Joe Amarante
