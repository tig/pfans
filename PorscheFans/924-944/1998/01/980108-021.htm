Roxanne,

	I drilled a very small hole in the lenses to let it drain, I
could not get the goldfish food in the top, and they died.

	Two tricks to try:

1.	make sure the drains on the spoiler are clear, they look like
two rectangles on either side at base of glass & Spoiler
2.	Make sure the drains on the latches are connected and not
clogged. They are the tubes at the base of latches, you will have to pop
the rear carpet cove to see them. I have an air supply, so I just give
them a good blow. You might have to improvise.
3.	If all else fails, use a # 60 drill or smaller to make the light
drain out.

	Best of luck

	Hello to everyone,

	OK, I'm tired of draining the right taillight lense everytime we
have an
	extended period of rain here.

	Can anyone give me some clues as to what I can do to alleviate
the
	situation?  I thought about drilling a small hole somewhere to
let it drain
	on its own.  If so, where would I do this so that it wouldn't
drain into
	the hatch?  I haven't noticed any water there so that leads me
to my next
	question.  How is the water getting in the lense?

	My boyfriend suggested I put a goldfish in there and let him
swim.  I
	didn't like that idea.

	Any help is appreciated.  TIA

	Roxanne,
	87 944
