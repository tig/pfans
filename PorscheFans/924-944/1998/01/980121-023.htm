(I'm not an expert at this, but here is my best try.  If someone notices any
discreptancies, please respond)

Tom,

KolbenSchmidt (the people who make the 944 block) uses a technology referred to
as Lokasil, which is the local placement of its Alusil technology.  Alusil is
the use of high silicon content aluminum to create engine blocks.  Lokasil is
the same technology except applied only to the cylinder bores.
(http://www.kolbenschmidt.de/e/fundea1.html#koehler)

Lokasil is the current technology used to make the cylinder bores of the new
water cooled sixes that Porsche uses.
(http://www.conceptdesign.com/dealersites/1998showroom/porsche/boxster.htm)

I don't know if the 944 block ia a complete Alusil product, however I doubt it
because of the effort required to make a complete Alusil block is not sutable
for high volume applications.
(http://www.kolbenschmidt.de/e/fundea1.html#koehler)

The 944 block has liners made up of AlSi, if you look at the top of a 944 block
you can see them in the cylinders.  These aluminum liners are available, and
can be refitted to the block.  (Motor Works, Inc.  in San Diego can re-fit the
944 block with the liners.)

As for re-siliconizing the liners.  I can only hypothesize that due to the
hardness of silicon, that the silicon in contact with the piston rings
eventually falls out or wears away.  This also probably happens when you bore
the block to the next oversize.  So the process of re-applying silicon to the
cylinders was used to "rejuvenate" them.

>From looking at the engine block, it looks like the liner is 2 mm think.  So
this would help explain the last oversize of 101 mm.

Hope this helps.

chris
