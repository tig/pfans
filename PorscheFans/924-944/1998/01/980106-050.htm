I just had that problem with my '90 S2- clutch to the floor. Eventually we
replaced both the master and slave cylinders and while doing so found that
the hose that connects the two had a split in it which we think was really
the problem. My sense is that it will surely get worse.

All,
There has been discussion several times regarding vibration under hard
accelleration in 951's.  One theory I specifically remember was that the rear
tires are "hopping".  The other day it hit me.. Could this vibration be due to
the multiple little spikes in the torque curve?  If you've seen any dyno
results you know what I mean.  Any thoughts?  I get some vibration under hard
accelleration, and it varies in amplitude sometimes.  I'm particularly
interested in hearing responses from those who have run the drilled cycling
valve setup.  The torque curve using this is smoother (i.e., no spikey stuff
from the KLR playing w/ the cyclingvalve)
