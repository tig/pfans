Well, since you ask...

True, you do need to look for play in the ball joint.  Anything 
approaching a millimeter indicates a need to replace.

However, there are other failure modes.  In my case, the ball joint 
stem snapped at the groove.  (Hey, maybe BFG doesn't have a monopoly on 
the term "groove of doom"!)  The "groove" is a circumferential notch in 
the ball joint stem.  A bolt through the base of the strut lies in this 
groove and so locks the ball joint to the strut.  It is a popular (er, 
frequent) failure point, since it's the thinnest section of the ball 
stem.

You cannot check for this unless you are willing to Magnaflux or x-ray 
the part.  It doesn't show looseness, it just breaks.  I am not sure 
that Magnafluxing will help, since there is no surface stress riser 
which would preferentially start the failure.  In my case, the 
particular arm had too many miles on it, and I should have life-timed 
the part.  (I've also had two materials/mechanical engineers opine that 
there was a material flaw in my stem.)

The Motorsports arms are no different than the Turbo S arms with one 
exception.  Instead of a groove around the whole circumference, there 
is a chamfer in one side.  This is just like 911 balls have always 
been.  The pain of this is only that the ball has to be oriented 
correctly during install.  If you do use these (fine) parts, do *not* 
mar the stem surface when you turn it to orient the chamfer - instance 
stress riser.

The other failure point is, of course, the sway bar drop link "well". 
 Again, probably no good way to reliably check it short of dye 
penetrant testing.  In the case, I am inclined to believe that testing 
will be a little more helpful.

The Fabcar arms are beautiful, well-made parts.  David Klym is 
brilliant and executes absolutely beautiful work.  If you ever want to 
put a roll cage in your car, you should consider giving Fabcar the 
business.  They turn out to be no more, sometimes less, expensive than 
the local shops, and the work is amazing.  If you go to PCA Club Races, 
check out Dave Maynard's very pink 911 race car and the work Klym did 
in it, esp. the yoke over the rear "tunnel."

If you do go with the Fabcar arms and are using a Weltmeister sway bar, 
you'll find that the drop link "buttons" don't fit in the a-arm wells. 
 I have a solution, drop me a line if interested.
