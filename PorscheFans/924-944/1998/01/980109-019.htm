Well, after being extremely difficult to open since the day
I bought the car, my passenger door finally became IMPOSSIBLE
to open (from the outside, anyway). My "friend" :) broke it
yesterday, now the trigger just flops around loosely. I'm
certain that the inner workings of the door handle have been
discussed on here before, so if anybody could direct me to
the approximate date, maybe I could find it in the archives?
I've been unsuccessful so far just searching through there
aimlessly. If anyone has any information at all, I'd really
appreciate it! It's been unseasonably warm around here this
year, but I know when the weather finally turns colder, I'll
need more than one option for getting into the car. It's not
uncommon for those suckers to freeze up!

Thanks alot!
