[Michel G. Wachholz replies:]

Actually there were two turbo 968 models.  Neither had 350hp.  The Turbo S 
had 305 hp and the Turbo RS had 330 hp.  Neither were imported by PCNA to 
the U.S. and there were only approx. 15 of each model built.

Porsche  968
By David Sparrow & Adrienne Kessel. Launched in the summer of 1992 in the 
UK, this front-engined 2+2 made a significant impact on the public's 
consciousness. Witness the smoothly contoured beauty of the turbocharged 
Porsche 968 with its six-speed automatic transmission and 260 bhp in this 
beautiful, full-color collection.


Hmm... hell of a car. 260 hp, turbo, 6-speed automatic. Maybe they just 
screwed up on the punctuation. The car of course did come in a turbo 
version (approx 350 hp), also with a six-speed (manual only), and an 
automatic (I believe it was a 5 ratio tiptronic).
