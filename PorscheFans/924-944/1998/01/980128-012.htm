Hello Surya! I read what you described in your situation. A similar
event happened to me shortly after I purchased my '83 944na. My radiator
bracket was not holding securely and the radiator leaned aft towards the
alternator and the pulley cut right through. Believe it or not, I got my
replacement from the chain Discount Auto Parts!

I double-checked the part nr 944.106.239.07 in my catalogs fm Auto
Atlanta, Automotion, and Performance Products and all concur that the
part nr fore-mentioned is for 85.5 - 89 944na. I then found that part nr
944.106.239.01 is for '83 944na only (Performance Products states for
"w/ bleeder") and 944.106.239.02 is for '83 - '85.5 944na (Performance
Products states for "w/o bleeder"). Apparently the dealer was either
giving you what they had in stock on the shelves or they just simply
didn't weren't properly informed. I think it was more of the first idea.
Most likely, I think part nr 944.106.239.02 is what you ought to ask for
from them and get a refund on the current hose -- it won't be of much
use to you or your Porsche.

Hope this helps.....
