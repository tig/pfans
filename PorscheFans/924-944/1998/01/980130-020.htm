Hi all,

I've been lurking this list for about a month now while seaching for a
944 to use as a daily driver/project(no racing or autoX). Yesterday I
saw an 83 944 advertised in the local paper for "$2500 neg."  I called
the owner and after a fairly long discussion, I'm not sure whether it's
a bargain.  It didn't sound like he knew that much about 944's and had
bought the car from "a friend" looking to "resell it" and make a little
profit.  Shortly after buying the car, he started it one morning and the
timing belt broke.  Since it broke with the engine just above idle and
not under load, all that was required was a valve job(according to
him).  It sounded like he blames the PO(and former "friend") for
improperly installing(or possibly tensioning) the belt and now he's out
$800 *plus his labor*(sounded like he pulled and reinstalled the head
himself!?) for the valve job on top of what he paid for the car.  The
car's been sitting for a couple years(hasn't been retitled or
registered) and the owner talks like he just wants to get rid of it.  I
think he'd take quite a bit less than the asking price.

I haven't seen the car yet, but the following are a few specifics based
on my phone call:

  - 125,000 miles
  - Engine "strong"
  - White paint("shot" according to owner)
  - Body generally straight with one dent in right front fender
  - Cracked windshield
  - Cracked dash
  - New hood and hatch lift struts
  - New battery(no corrosion under battery according to owner)
  - No leaks(also according to owner)
  - A/C compressor and fan run but don't cool(prob. bad hoses/seals)
  - New clutch(? - installed by PO)

That's all I know right now, but I'll likely go look at the car
tomorrow.  I've read the FAQ thru several times, but is there anything
else specific to the early 944's that I should look for?  A recent post
said that cruise control modules are no longer available for the
pre-85.5 cars.  Is this true?  Also, before I can register the car, it
will have to pass an emissions test.  It's a 15 yr old car that's been
sitting for 2-3 years - what's the probability that it won't pass and
what repairs might be required?  

I apologize for all the newbie questions, but this will be my first
Porsche and I'm not above waiting for another car at more than twice the
price if I should avoid this one.  Also, while I'm new to Porsches, I'm
not new to things mechanical.  I have no problem with putting large
amounts of "sweat equity" into the car.

BTW, I'm currently on the digest version of the list, so to avoid the
24hr delay, feel free to cc me on your response.

Thanx,
Patrick
