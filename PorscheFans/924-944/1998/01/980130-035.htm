After checking the codes, my 87 944 is Almond Beige Metallic.  Apparently
Mandel means almond in German.  Maybe somebody on the list knows for sure.
I was able to order touch up paint through the dealer but the match wasn't
very good.  Luckily my boyfriend does paint and body work for a living so
he was able to get it to match.

I have the same interior also.

Interesting name.  Actually the only name I have for mine is baby, Michael
is my boyfriend.  I hope to have pictures of his 83 on the page soon.
