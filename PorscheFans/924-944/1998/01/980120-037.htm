Raymond --

I had a similar problem w/ my S2 after removing the cam cover to check
chain tensioner wear.  If I recall, the heat shield comes very close to
several nearby parts, including the distributor.   If the shield was moved,
slightly bent, or unbolted at a few spots, double-check it's current
location and bend or reposition it if necessary.  My problem was
exaggerated because the timing of the balance shaft belt was off a notch,
causing a little extra vibration.  Sounds like you have some extra
vibration on cold starts that would produce a similar effect - which is
pretty startling when you first hear it.  I assume there's no engine mount
problem at idle, because you replaced at least one of them.
