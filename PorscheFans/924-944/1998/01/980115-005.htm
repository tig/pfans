Ken,

The sounds you noticed coming from the right seat are a common 944
sound. I've heard them in both of my 944's. Cornering taken to higher
levels can even result in the passenger side becoming more clawed with
time, an unavoidable condition at times. This is simply because the
right seat always seems to think it is going 25 - 30 percent faster than
the left seat.

However, "upgrading" to Girlfriend 2.0 from 1.0 will not remove
right-seat sounds, so forget it -- unless there are other reasons to
make a change. With subsequent revisions of Girlfriend, all you will
notice will be changes in pitch and diction; the sounds will remain.
(Comments, philosophical or otherwise, are welcome on this particular
topic.)

The body roll you mention, well, I never experienced that too much with
the stiffer suspension mods I tried. But, I have pushed into some
four-wheel drifts and that seem to always create a unique hush-gasp
sound, instead of the more usual outright screaming or complaining when
pressing thru the twisties around home.

Never complains from the right seat, even when it's been my car.
