I recently uninstalled Wife v.1.0.  I subsequently tried Girlfriend 1.0,
1.1, 1.2 and 1.3.  In each case, I experienced problems similar to those
reported by other correspondents.  

I now am testing the beta version of Girlfriend 2.0.  To date, there
have been no incompatibilities with OS 951S observed.  Most recent bench
test resulted in silent operation at 130 Mph although there was
unintrusive audio during acceleration consisting of low decibel "Wows". 
Other advantages over Wife v.1.0 and Girlfriend 1.0 to 1.3 are ease of
installation, less use of RAM and more pleasing graphical interface.  If
additional testing does not reveal any anomalies, I probably will mount
version 2.0 on my hard drive permanently.

Unless you are prepared to change operating systems, it is advisable to
uninstall earlier versions of Wife/Girlfriend software as soon as
practicable since they are impossible to debug.  Be sure to remove all
related extensions, control panels and preferences from your System
Folder*.  Then you either should pick up your own copy of Girlfriend 2.0
in beta or wait for the final release (shareware is not recommended).

*Apologies to Windows users.
