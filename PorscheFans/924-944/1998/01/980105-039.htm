You don't have to lift the motor much.

The trick to this job is to get the front up as high as you can
*	Block and support the motor from underside (Nice block of wood
on oil pan then floor jack)
*	Remove the tires (front only)
*	scribe the lower alignment arms
*	unbolt the lower motor mount nut
*	Unbolt the cross member bolts (4 - 2 each side)
*	Unbolt the Steering rack from cross member
*	Lower cross member down
*	Unbolt the two upper motor mount bolts, and wigle the mount out.

Reveres procedure to install
Rebolt rack and cross member re-aligning it to scribe marks

Remember to get the longer mount bolts if your upgrading the mount to
the turbo mount which you should do anyway.

As a CYA you could the do a front end alignment if your were unsure of
your scibes, but that's a cheap job for a tire store to do.

It takes me 2.5 hours to do both in my driveway, and I take a lot of
breaks.

	Subject:	installing motor mounts/lifting engine

	I don't have a professional tool to lift the engine out of the
car to change the
	motor mounts, so when I thought of this, I decided to ask
whether or not it
	would be safe first.  Anyway, what I'd like to do (obviously) is
lift the engine
	out of the car.  Is it possible to do this by simply jacking up
the car, placing
	a (strong) object underneath the engine, like a big block of
wood, and then
	lowering the car?  Is the oil pan (I guess that's the bottom
part, there) strong
	enough?  Thanks in advance!
