10 weeks warm storage, humid environment? This is my best advice, and
most of it applies to winter storage as well, except that during warm
storage there is no anti-freezing conditions to worry about:

Wash the car a few days before storage. Dry completely. Then, take it
for a drive to dry it out even more. Open both doors when you get back
and dry the water from the door sills, and around the door. Hopefully,
you won't drive it in the rain in this prep-for-storage time. Not a bad
idea at this time to also apply silicone to the door seal rubber parts.

Remove the battery. Put it on a wood surface, away from the car, NOT on
concrete so it does not drain charge as quick.

Put the car in a secure environment, with a cover on it. Optional: put
it on partial stands, not fully in the air. Hey, it's only 10 weeks.

Most important -- (I think) is to leave a full fuel tank, with a bottle
of gas stabilizer in it. Put the bottle in, run the engine for just a
minute or so to help disperse the stuff. Gas goes sour after a time
(some claim only a month!) and less air in the tank means less available
oxygen for oxidation of your fuel. I have read that it is wise to either
do this, or drain ALL the fuel out. Since the fuel also acts as a
coolant for the in-tank fuel pump, I'd say leave it full. Plus, this
approach is less work (and more environmentally friendly) than
disconnecting the fuel line near the filter, and draining gas out...

Crack the windows open for some air circulation (hopefully the car is in
a secure environment, like I said!)

Also, place a few thick towels, spread out, on a wood board in the hatch
area. This will help absorb any interior condensation.

When you get back, lower the car, remove the towels, put the battery in,
roll it back and forth to awaken the tires. Check cold tire pressure;
correct if needed. You might want to put a battery charger on the
battery for a few hors; this depends on your battery age & condition.

Remove the fuel pump relay and fuse. Ground the coil primary wire. Crank
the engine (max of 15 secs per cranking) until you get full oil
pressure, per gauge needle deflection. (Usually has taken me 2 to 4
tries).

Reinstall fuel pump fuse and relay. Start the car. Go for a gentle
drive, speedwise, to get everything warm. Don't play the radio during
any of this; listen to the car. Stop, check fluids: oil, water, battery
electrolyte level, power steering fluid level (this item checked with
car idling and warm). Correct fluid levels as needed, enjoy life.

Hopefully, all will be happy, normal, and there will be no suprises.
