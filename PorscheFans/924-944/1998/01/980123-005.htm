The advise I got when I started was:
	Don't do anything to the car, just make sure it's safe.
	Use street tires.  I used BFG comp/ta street tires.
That's what I did for the first year and a half.  Had a blast.  I was
amazed at how much I improved.  Yes, you will use up your street tires
faster depending how much you run.  You will be slower then the guys on 
sticky tires but you will eventually improve your technique such that
you'll be real close.
