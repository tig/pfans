Oh, Oh. I've been found out!! To be honest, I didn't have a road test data
for the 968 so I "calculated" based on the percentage of difference between
the 3 known ratios and the 2 known speeds. It would sure be helpful if you
or anyone has access to "real", accurate road test numbers.

John Christensen had data on the 3:38 which was different than posted by R&T
and it appears the R&T info is NOT accurate. Obviously, this would then
effect my estimated 968 data. With corrected 3.38 data from John's info and
the Owners Manual for verification, the following is now submitted for "peer
review":

Corrected speeds in each gear @6400rpm:

968 --  1st: 35  2nd: 60  3rd: 83  4th: 103  5th: 129  6th: 155
3.38 -- 1st: 39  2nd: 67  3rd: 98  4th: 133  5th: 162
3.89 -- 1st: 33  2nd: 56  3rd: 83  4th: 113  5th: 140

If this straightens out the data, what's everyone's thoughts on the choices.
Which of these alternatives is "best", for what uses, and for what reasons?
