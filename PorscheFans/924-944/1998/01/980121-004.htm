When I see a used-car addvertisement from germany, they write TÜV 8/98.
What does it mean : TÜV?
And what is the date behind the "TÜV"?

I'm new to the list and I just purchased an 86 944 Turbo about a month   
ago.  It has 108 K on it and it is running very well.  Still though,   
there are all of those 'things' that need to be fixed on a new 'used' car   
when you get it.  I've seen many of them mentioned over the last couple   
weeks and I will just list them here for general comment.

1.  The biggest problem I seem to have is an oil leak.  Under normal   
circumstances it just leaves a small agravating stain wherever I park the   
car.  I haven't been able to isolate/see the source yet but it is coming   
from the back of the engine (center) and has a bad habit of dripping on   
the exhaust pipe.  The worst part, I think, is that when I changed the   
oil with the front of the car up on jack stands I happen to notice a   
significant stream of oil pouring out the back of the engine five minutes   
later.  I probably lost about a cup of oil before it 'stopped'.  Rear   
engine seals?  I'm not familiar enough with this engine to know what else   
it could be.  If so, perhaps I will have to live with it until I have   
other major reasons to tear it apart like maybe a new clutch.  Currently   
the clutch inspection shows at about 27 mm (40 % left?)  Any general rule   
on how long that should last?  Will I be spreading newspaper on the   
garage floor for this pup for a year or two?
2. I also have the nervous temp gauge.  Swings like a windshield wiper.   
 Where is the sender on the turbo model?
2a.  Oil pressure is 5 while cold but never drops below 4.  I've removed   
the sender, kicked it around and cleaned it up with no change.
3. My speedometer is registering fast.  Havn't gotten the wife out to   
pace me yet for an accurate measurment but it is measuring fast or   
everybody else in town has sped up considerably since I got this car.
4. Havn't looked yet but it seems that only one side of the sun roof is   
latching.  I see lots of mail on this topic.
5. Leaking hose under the PS resevoir.  I replaced the hose to the pump.   
 I've tightened and tightened the other hose.  Whats the best way to stop   
that leaky hose?
6. Well I guess there isn't a 6, but I have already experienced the rear   
tires breaking loose and swinging out on me on a wet road while making a   
turn.  Scared the heck out of me since I, of course, wasn't expecting it.   
 I was able to correct and keep it in my lane but I drove like an old   
lady the rest of the way home!  Thankfully I had new tires and lots of   
luck.
I'd appreciate any comments on how to handle these things and any other   
advice you've got for a new Porsche owner.  I should have bought this car   
years ago!

Oh, one other thing.  The silver is wearing off my wheels (phone dials)   
and it is white/cream colored underneath.  Are these the white magnesium   
phone dials someone mentioned a few days ago?
