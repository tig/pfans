A recent posting that suggested you could change the cooling fan switch
without removing the fans must have originated fom a magician.  It's hard
to even see the thing without removing the fans....

<<  Well I guess there isn't a 6, but I have already experienced the rear   
 tires breaking loose and swinging out on me on a wet road while making a   
 turn.  Scared the heck out of me since I, of course, wasn't expecting it.   
  I was able to correct and keep it in my lane but I drove like an old   
 lady the rest of the way home!  Thankfully I had new tires and lots of   
 luck.
 I'd appreciate any comments on how to handle these things and any other   
 advice you've got for a new Porsche owner.  I should have bought this car   
 years ago! >>

Without knowing the actual circumstances of your "tail wagging" incident
(speed, your reaction with steering and throttle, etc), it's impossible to
comment on what happened, why, and what could have been done about it.  I will
say that after driving a 944 and a 951S for 7 years now on the track and on
the street, in summer and winter,  I'm surprised by stories of tricky
handling.  Other than (briefly) trying to get by with performance tires in
snow and ice, I've found these cars to be completely predictable and easily
recovered.  The turbos can overpower the rear tires, but not in an
unpredictable way in my experience (which includes many years of track and car
control instruction).

As for handling very low traction conditions (as apparently experienced by the
listmember who reported losing the rear end at 15 mph on wet pavement and
striking a curb),  the first thing to do is depress the clutch and release the
brakes, if on.  You need to make all the tires' grip available for steering
and to resist lateral forces.  When it's that slippery, even releasing the
throttle can cause loss of traction at the rear -- you need to let the rear
tires turn freely with no acceleration and minimal resistance (from braking or
engine rotational inertia).  Experiment on ice or snow, if you're lucky enough
(haha) to have some in your area!
