Mr. Gregor,

There is a switch, or at least there was one on my 87 944S.  I could down
shift with no problem, the cruise control would resume only after letting
out the clutch. 

However!! if I put the car in neutral without cancelling the cruise
control and let out the clutch, then the tach needle would immediately be
bouncing off the rev limiter at 7300 rpm.  I learned my lesson after it
happened once but it scared the #$%^ out of me (the engine was cold and I
thought I had ruined it).
