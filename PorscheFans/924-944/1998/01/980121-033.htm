Congrats, and welcome to the club. Speaking of the club, join the PCA.

If you bought one in decent shape, and take care of it, you can put
ANOTHER 108K on it, easy!

You have to realize that most of these care are 10 or so years old.
Most people, even Porsche owners, don't care enough about the cars to
take care of them. The 944 line has the 'problem' of being relatively
inexpensive to purchase (but still expensive to maintain). That means that
a lot of people can afford to buy one, but not afford to maintain one.

One of my friends bought an 87 951 yesterday. 90K miles, standard options,
plus ABS and airbags (I'm not sure anymore if airbags are good or not).
He paid $5500 for it. Yes it needs some work, but if you can work on 
the car yourself, these cars can be almost dirt cheap. If you can't
work on it yourself, you better have a fat wallet!

This weekend: Timing and balance belt, front seals. (less than $100 total)
Future: new brakes (rotors are $70 each, MetalMaster pads are $30, Ate fluid
 is $10, so for $180 all new front brakes, can't beat that price), new wires,
 plugs, cap, rotor, new hoses, new trans fluid, new rear tires. So, add some
 more $ for misc. stuff and he'll have a great car.

ditto. That, and the power steering leak.
