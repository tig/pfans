Hey guys I need help.

I amm trying to fix my sunroof...everyone (mechanics and such) has told me
that the reason the sunroof breaks is because of these plastic gears. I have
two of the gears to replace my old ones, but where are they supposed to go.
I have removed the headliner to the point that I can access the sunroof
mechanisms. I have removed the sunroof mechanisms...discovering that the
place where the wire connects to the rod that lifts the sunroof on the
drivers side is broken, so I plan on figuring out someway to weld the two
and reconnect them. Anyway, I removed the white plastic box in the center of
the roof, and discovered that the gear insode is metal. So where do the
plastic ones go? I'm starting to remove the sunroof mechanism in the back
flare to see if they go somewhere in there. but I would like some help, and
as its sunday, I can't call anyone. so I f you could reply to me directly
ASAP I would appreciate it. Its been raining, although today is sunny, so I
really don't want to drive w/o a roof.
