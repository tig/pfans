HI Again, 

I have great news to report. Turns out that hickville's very own NAPA 
Auto Parts had the right color. :)  I talked to someone else other than 
the idiot who showed me the tractor paint and she was very helpful.  I 
knew that it was called guards red but it took quite a while to find b/c 
it was under another name (someone mentioned it to me in an e-mail). 
Anyway I told her it was for a PORSCHE and immediately she reaches under 
the desk way in the back and pulls out a "Porsche color chips book" :) 
We found the color eventually and I am going to order it tomorrow. I 
finished priming it at school yesterday (One of the advantages to living 
in hickville is that the mechanic based courses are very well funded :) 
) We just got a new spray booth last week and the new one has baking 
capabilities and everything else nice. Thanks for all the messages I am 
going to try my luck with good old NAPA paint ( they say its actually 
pretty good ?) 

thx danl
1980 924 soon to be Guards Red/on black
