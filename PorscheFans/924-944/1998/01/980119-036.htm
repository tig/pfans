You've asked for comments, so I will give them, but please realize that
I was not there, so it's difficult to figure out what happened.  I am
very sorry to hear about your accident, and I feel that you did all that
you really could to save the day.  The most important thing is that you
are ok.

So, what would I have done different?  I would have given in earlier.
I don't know about others on this list, but I find that once the tail
starts to slide in a 944TS, you get one chance to catch it, after that,
it's best to ease off the throttle or if you are already spinning, put
two feet in.  Basically, if the rear steps to the right, you countersteer,
if it comes back and swings to the left (I call this the transaxle toss),
at that point, if you countersteer again, there is a good chance you are
just increasing the velocity of the rear when it comes back to slide 
again to the right, so instead, I don't countersteer and keep light
pressure on the throttle and keep the steering straight.  That seems to
bring the back into a straight line again without the second round of
"t-tossing".  When it does straighten though, I find it comes into line
really hard with a very sudden jerk, but it does straighten.

Depending on how you hit the curb, damage can be super variable.  I've seen
some cars tap curbs where wheels and control arms are broken or even worse,
the strut goes through the hood!  I've also driven a car over a curb where
the damage was a wheel with a 90 degree pie-chunk taken out of it with
control arms and alignment still perfect (previous car).

This is an area where I'm looking forward to other people's responses.
Like I said above, I give myself one chance, one movement to the side,
countersteer, if it slaps the other way, then I ease it into center and
ease back the throttle, so far it's worked.  One thing I should mention
here is that your tires are NOT helping you at all.  I love the feel of
SP8000's, I like the grip and the wear, but for some reason they do not
slide straight in the rain.  I have a hard time of making the S-02 slide
sideways in the rain, they light both rear tires up and the car still goes
straight.  With SP8000's, the car used to pitch IMMEDIATELY when the rears
broke loose (this is in wet conditions that would not take the better
hydroplaning ability of the S-02 into consideration).

>Reviewing the accident in my mind, I'm very disappointed.  First, I'm
>unhappy with the hardware (car).  I don't feel like the fronts should have

You shouldn't be unhappy, you came out safe and that's all that really
matters.  There are incredible forces taken by a car when it hits a curb
at any speed;  you get quite a jolt going up a on a poorly designed
entrance ramp at 2mph, imagine the jolt of going up a 4" high curb at 10mph!

>had (relatively) plenty of time to react.  Yet I seem to have reacted with
>my testicles rather than my brain.  By the way, I found these appendages

All of my spins have been at an auto-x or a track event and even there,
it's hard to think properly when it's all happening.  I think a key thing
to remember is to know when to give up.  Sometimes, it's better to give
up, then to try to save it, trying to save it in some circumstances can
lead to a higher speed or more dangerous situation.  I want to make it clear
that I am not saying that you did anything wrong, just a comment on my
part.

You came out safe and didn't hit another, that's what matters.  Should've,
could've, would've doesn't matter, no one was hurt, a control arm is 
cheap compared to a human arm!

>Comments welcome.  Please try to keep the recriminations down as I feel bad
>enough already :-(  About the only small note of sunshine in this is that I

I hope I haven't come across harshly.  I've seen other VERY GOOD drivers
spin their 944's on the street, all seem to have the M030 suspension.
Paul and I have not, but we drive VERY slowly in the rain after some
scarey close calls.  And, especially having driven in the rain on the
track, I think we know what can happen in a split second and a split second
is too short of a time to correct something on the street, with all the
variables around.

Anyhow, I hope you feel better as the days go on and don't feel bad, even
Hans Stuck spins his GT-1 once in a while!  Wait till you drive your 951
in the rain on slicks, anyone that has seen my video saw me do a doosey
at Kent in the rain with the Hoosiers on, almost no warning, just turned
right around!
