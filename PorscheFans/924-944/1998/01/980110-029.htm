Anyone tried "Kleen Wheels" from Performance Products. They are discs
installed behind the wheels to keep brake dust off the wheels. They claim
they do not hinder brake cooling. I find this hard to believe. Sounds great
if they really work and don't heat up the brakes. Has any one on the list
tried them?

 Greetings Porsche Fans,
 I am relatively new to the group and am excited to have found this Porsche
 outlet.  I have two 931's; a red ' 81 and a silver ' 82, both with the M471.
 The cars are garaged and driven on a regular, though not daily, basis.  I
have
 spent a good amount of time behind the wheel and under the hood of the cars
 and am pretty familiar with the workings and characteristics of the late
924T.
 I would like to throw in my two cents about the early water-cooled Porsches
 and look forward to making some new friends and learning much more about the
 cars I enjoy so much.
 
 The original concept of the 924, from its initial development as a Volkswagen
 and ultimate production as a Porsche, was to build an affordable sports car.
 The concept was a good one, though not embraced by many Porsche purists.
 Early in its history, the 924 was bit under powered, under tired and suffered
 from various mechanical problems.  But in typical Porsche fashion, the car
was
 subtly refined from year to year; bumping up the engine displacement, adding
a
 turbocharged version, changing transaxles, upgrading the suspension, brakes,
 turbos, and ignition systems, all with very little change in outward
 appearance.  All this culminated in the 1982 in the top of the watercooled
 line, the 924T or 931.
 
 The 1982 924T came standard with five bolt 15" alloy wheels, brake parts from
 the 911 and 928, a digital ignition, and a beefier transaxle (with a "normal"
 shift pattern compared to earlier transaxles).  My dealer tells me that all
82
 Turbos came with limited slip, though I'm not sure of this.  The M471 package
 I've seen several references to in the list, refers to cars with front and
 rear sway bars and 16" 928 style wheels with 205-55 tires.  I don't know if
 the spring rates are different with the M471.  If memory serves me, I believe
 my ' 82 had an MSRP of approx. $22,000.00.  I can verify that when I remember
 where I put the window sticker in my "wonderful" filing system.
 
 Although, for reasons real or perceived, the 924 never really got the
 attention of the public or press, I really enyoy these cars.  I do feel that
 if Porsche would have introduced the 924 with spec's closer to what the ' 82
 924 and 924T had, it would have enjoyed a much more celebrated existence. 
 
 I would love to hear from anybody interested in these cars, especially those
 with experience in performance upgrades for the 931.  I have a variable boost
 control on my cars and run about 14 psi. boost safely and that makes it a
 reasonably quick car, but would like to know what else works on these cars.
 As the cars sit, they are a lot of fun to drive and have been quite trouble
 free.  The ' 82 has 80k on the odo (car looks like it has 40k on it) and even
 has the original turbo in it, which is somewhat of a feat.  I've had these
 cars for a long time and plan on keeping them, so any suggestions or info on
 maintenance, parts and upgrades would be greatly appreciated.
 Next car purchase, a 1988 951S or '89 951.
 Anyone else in Colorado?
