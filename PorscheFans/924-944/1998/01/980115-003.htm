>Question:
>Has anyone else experienced this?

Ken,
From Tech Supplement 6.9:
Screeching and thrashing are common problems with Girlfriend 1.0. 
There appears to be a manufacture defect so that there is early 
bearing seizure due to lack of lubrication. (whoa, going just a bit 
too far). Girlfriend 2.0, otherwise known as special Porsche Part 
number P-GF101172, however is, at the time this went to press, not 
available to the general public. Although if special Porsche Part 
number P-GF101172 were available to the general public PCNA would 
assess a license fee of $7000 per month for unlimited use. You may be 
advised however given your current financial situation to upgrade to 
special Porsche Part number P-GF101172 if you happen to locate one on 
the black market as Girlfriend 1.0, otherwise known as special 
Porsche Part number P-GF2817384 has been shown to have a severe mall 
dysfunction. As special Porsche Part number P-GF101172 is a dealer-
only item  no telephone number exists. In the meantime decrease 
lateral g-forces from 3.8 to 2.4 as per your Porsche-authorized 
Haynes manual.

Maybe Rox has a lead on a black-market Girlfriend 2.0?
