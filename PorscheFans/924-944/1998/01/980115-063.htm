Hi all

I recently replaced my timing/balance shaft belts, rollers, water pump, and 
front seals on my 87 944 N/A. It is running fine, however I did not install 
the new crank seal correctly. (The EPA would lock me up if they knew how 
many quarts of oil I have used since I replaced the seal a two weeks and 
400 miles ago.) Anyways, I'm planning on taking it apart and fixing it this 
weekend. Could someone out there in 944 land give me a procedure to follow 
for replacing the crank seal, like what to remove, etc.

When I replaced the seal, I was not able to remove what I perceived to be 
the fixed keyway, and consequently the large washer could not be removed 
either.

Additionally, when I placed the drive belts back on, a bearing on the 
alternator decided to give way (I swear I didn't tighten it any tighter 
than it was when I took it off :) ). Needless to say, occasionally, when I 
start the car and other times, the bearing makes a horrible screeching 
noise. Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to replace this bearing. 
I would prefer not replacing the entire alternator unit. Anyone have any 
information on any shops which will repair alternators in the Seattle area?

Any help much appreciated.
