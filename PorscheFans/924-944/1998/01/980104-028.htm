Yep, to pull the 951  oil pan off, you need to remove the exhaust crossover
pipe,
the front swaybar, the control arms, the crossmember (with the power
steering
rack) then you can get to all of the bolts for the oil pan...

Before removing the pan, however, double check to make sure that it is
indeed
the oil pan gasket leaking, and not one of the shaft seals (crank or
balance)...

It would be a real bummer if you did all of that work to find out it was not
the cause of the leak...

Good Luck!
