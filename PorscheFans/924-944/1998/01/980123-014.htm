It turns out I didn't fix the problem by removing the shavings,
because the problem returned last night after I ran the car again.  
Sorry for spreading wrong information, PFans.

I found that the reference mark sensor measured infinite ohms
when the engine ran poorly.  So, I removed it from the car, let
it cool down, and found that it measured a normal 1k ohms (thanks
again, Barry).  Heating the sensor caused it to go from 1k to 
infinite ohms each time. Hopefully when I get a new sensor next
week, the car will be fixed.

And a tip when removing the sensors: disconnect them from their
connectors at the top of the engine, because you can put enough
strain on them while passing your hand through to damage the
connector (don't ask me how I know).  And be sure to cover up
the hole in the bell housing!
