We ran into the same thing on my boyfriends 83 944.  That was about a year
ago and he still hasn't done anything with it.  I would be interested in
ideas you guys may have.  I couldn't have gone that long with it the way it
is, but hey, its not my car.

=0AHello Tom,=0A=09Check to make syre that the dash light bulbs are not l=
oose. They twist 90=92 in=0Athe circuit board. On my car, the bulb holder=
s were slightly loose when=0Atwisted the full 90=92. I simply turn the bu=
lbs utill they are snug and tight=0Awith the circuit board film for a goo=
d connection. Also use a good contact=0Acleaner like Wurth OL, or Stabale=
nt22a. =0A=09I my car I had to go into there quite afew time before fixin=
g it for once and=0Afor all! I would also reccomend replacing all three b=
