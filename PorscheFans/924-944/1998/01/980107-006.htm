Probably pretty good, but sooner or later, 375-405 HP and 330-365 ft-lbs of
torque will catch up to you, and the 315/35x17 rear tires will get the
power down and pull.

There are a few ZR-1's here, but no real equivalent drivers. I think a
reasonable comparison would be a 911 turbo 3.6. Can a chipped 951 keep up
with a 3.6? It all depends on the driver, how the 3.6 is set up, etc.

The 944/951 of course is one of the best handling cars ever built so it is
much more, er, amenable to my going fast. The ZR-1 understeers (at least my
friend's does), but nothing an alignment won't fix. The raw cornering grip
is there, though not as nice to get at as with the Porsche, imho.
