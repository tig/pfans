Hi Richard,
same problem here in Portugal. Someone informs me that we can put unleaded
fuel in the 2nd. series of the 924 NA (1980?-1985). By other hand, I've
made a call to Shell (it was a line free for this purpose). They said that
they will be informed (there are not so much 924 in the road) and call me
latter. So, I guess they asked to the Porsche dealer here, and said between
every 3 tanks of unleaded fuel 98, top up with 1 tank of Super leaded 98.
Note that in the manual of my car (imported from Germany) states minimum 98
ROZ/RON fuel. So, I'm again without knowing for sure. When time arrives, I
will see if exists any additive or so. It is just not possible to make
"disappear" all the cars that use leaded fuel !!! If you know for sure,
inform me.
