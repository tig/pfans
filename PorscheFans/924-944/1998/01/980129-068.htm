Hansman here
Purchased my 86 951(944 t) with 80,000 miles. 116,000 now.
The turbos on these cars are water cooled, they also recieve cool oil
via oil cooler. 200,000 is my goal. 
Of more important issue is the prevoius owner history of any Porsche you
or anyone decides to purchase. Oil change history is THE #1 priority.
