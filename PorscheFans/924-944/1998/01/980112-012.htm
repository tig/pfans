Hi Dhruv! It's funny that you should mention about possible coil
peformance mods. I remembered that my Dad's XJS also runs an electronic
ignition and fuel management system. Though it is Lucas named, it is
licensed by Bosch. The Lucas Sport Coil is rated at 40,000 volts. It is
designed to accomodate electronic ignition systems. So, since I totaled
my '80 MGB anniversary edition into the center concrete divider on I-95
southbound, I figured to try it out on my '83 944 na with positive
results. I definitely do feel a more solid and stronger response in my
non-turbo engine. I'll endorse it, as since Bosch doesn't put out a coil
(to my knowledge) that is compatible to an electronic management system
nor a coil that puts out a voltage as high, 40kv vs 28kv. Their Blue and
Red coils are supposedly rated for breaker point ignition systems. This
is my US$0.02 worth. Does anyone else out there have any input,
contradicting or concurring? I'd like to know if it would have any bad
side effects on the engine or the DME, long term that is.
