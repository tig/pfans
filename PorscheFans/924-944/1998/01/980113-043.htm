Hello Porschefans.

I have the 1978 Porsche 924 stripped down and ready to go. Just about =
every part the you may need is available. If you remember back to my =
original post (This was the car that had the windows broken out, as it =
sat for sale out by original owners house.)

Most of the car is in very good shape, not concours, but would work well =
for a daily driver's car. Example: taillights are in very good =
condition, with a couple very small hairline scratches in the lenses. =
(Minor blemishes)

Seats, and fenders have been sold already..sorry about that...

Interior is a butterscotch brown. The dash does have the dreaded crack =
in it....

It does have a new clutch kit in it. (as per the the previous owner).
E-mail me if you need a 924 part, and I'll see if I can help you out.=20

The car is located in the Mid-Michigan Area (USA) so use that as a guide =
for shipping costs. As the buyer pays shipping on the parts.

Thanks for the use of the band width...

Steve
