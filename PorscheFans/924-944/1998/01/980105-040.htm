I agree with Marv here - as I have not suffered from the failure (yet) I
could/would not join a class action, however I would join a pressure group
which would help Porsche understand that refunding (say) parts costs to
those affected and establishing a preventative maintenance campaign
schedule for those not yet affected would be a good and cheaper compromise
than any legal action.
I'd humbly ask that we do this world-wide and not just in the US as well.
Thanks, down-under S2 owner.....IanS

I seem to be able to read most of the digest now with my upgrade to Word '97.
On the other stuff, I take Paul's advice and delete the unreadable.    
 
On Project Indy, Paul Foster writes:

>>Not too well. I saw this car at it's introdutory race at Laguna Seca.
The mood was general disappointment that Porsche would be attempting to
campaign a car that was obviously uncompetitive. The chassis was
obviously behind the times, but he engine was a screamer. Porsche
_knows_ turbochargers. The next year they had limited success running
this engine in a March chassis. Teo Fabi even won a race. Porsche then
built another chassis but it was carbon fiber instead of the prevalent
aluminum honeycomb. Indycar owners thought they would be instantly
uncompetitive and have to upgrade to keep up so they banned it. It
pissed off Porsche so much they decided to leave the series.<<

I wanted to add:

One very sad factor that  was the decided death knell for project INDY, the
loss of  project manager and Porsche Motorsport USA Director Al Holbert, in a
crash of his private airplane.  Al Holbert was the reason that Porsche was
involved in Project Indy.  With his domination of the IMSA Prototype series
(962), and Holbert's success in just about every form of road racing,
(including the Trans Am 944 Turbo), Porsche was encouraged to try Indy racing
again. 

I have a promotional tape Porsche put out called "Project 2908" that shows
some of the steps that were necessary to campagin the car.  It shows footage
of Al Unser testing at Laguna Seca with uncontrolled oversteer evidenced by
two very long black strips of rubber left on the turn exits. Later it shows a
dejected Al Unser telling Springer and Holbert that the car would not hook up
and handled poorly. It also shows some nice CAD-CAM machining of the Indy V-8
engine block. 

The tape ends abruptly with the promise of a countinuation.....I think the
tape was made before the death of Al Holbert......

You may be able to get a copy of this tape at  you local dealer. They usually
have them stored away in some case with alot of previous model demo tapes.
Make friends with the salesman and offer him a few bucks for it.....
