Is this the "cycling valve"?  Do you have the part number?

                         Thanks!

On a more personal note, do we all recieve jealous and dirty looks for

I am probably the youngest person on this list (at the ripe young age of 17).
I saved up for 3 years of working part time to buy my first '86 951 (in
absolutely beautiful condition).  I drive it to school and even the faculty
gives me bad looks, like "little brat, look what daddy bought him."  I can't
stand that.  I busted my butt to buy this car, my pride and joy, for 3 years
while still in school with no help from my parents.  I know more about these
cars than half the adults I know (mainly because of this list--thanks guys!!)
because of the endless hours researching, reading everything I could with the
name Porsche written on it.  All I can say is that I am the happiest 17 year
old alive because of my car.  It's an obsession.  Sorry I didn't waste all of
my money on trips and clothes.   Do the research, save the money and anyone
can own a Porsche.  But It's not so much as owning it as it is appreciating it
for its beauty and its engineering.  Anyway, thank you for the help everybody.
Let people say what they want.  They're the ones buying the bumper stickers
that say "my other car is a Porsche," envying we who drive them.  Happy
Porsche-ing!!!!!   JSHARRY@AOL.COM

Hello Manfred

	Chances are you have the original rotor or some has glued it on in place. You
will need to carefully crush the old rotor off with some pliers or vise-grips.
If you feel uncomfortable take you car to a compentent Porsche repair shop.
Make sure you use blue loctite to secure the rotor's set screw! The Germens
love to glue on the rotors from the factory, VW used this same method on their
16 Valve engines too!

						Good Luck, DavidJalai@aol.com

Subject: Exhanging my rotor?

Hi everyone,

Can somebody tell me how to replace the rotor on my '88 944?
I tried to get it of by unscrewing the bolt that's in it, but it was
still holding on to something...
Should I use a special tool or something to pull it off?

Manfred
