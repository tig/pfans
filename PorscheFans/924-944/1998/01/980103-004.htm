This is not too hard to believe when consider the number of sport utility 
vehicles with modified suspensions that raise the vehicles to the point 
where aircraft stepping ladders are required for entry.

With the boon of sales of the sport utility vehicles, more and more are 
gaining altitude.  Many come from the manufacture that way, but 
regardless, most never see more than a twig on the road, let alone the 
off road use they were designed for.

The problem is that the sport utility vehicle, like other trucks, are 
exempt from the safety standards that govern automobiles.  One prime 
example is bumper height.  Raising a vehicle for on road use may look 
cool, but it is dangerous for the occupants as well as the other 
vehicles.  This worked when the number of vehicles sold were low, but now 
the increasing numbers raise the probability of accidents and rollovers 
from excessively high centers of gravity.

For us, it is impossible to see around these rolling walls, however, 
should the trend continue, we might soon be able to see under them!

Where I work, I have a colleague that parks his stock Toyota T1000 next 
to my car.  Pulling out of the parking space is impossible as there is no 
way to see oncoming traffic.  I just craw as slowly as possible hoping 
that oncoming cars will slow and stop, realizing that I can not see 
anything.

Still, there are those people that have a legitimate use for off-road 
vehicles and they should be able to buy what they need.

As usual, it is the same story with the government pendulum.  They always 
over react.
