My experience with Dunlop all-seasons is not printable. I had better
experience with the OEM tires (Conti CV51's, Pirelli P6's, - neither of
which is all season by any stretch of the imagination).

Count yourself lucky. We've got a state of emergency here, troops
patrolling the streets to prevent looting (Ha! as is anyone would ever loot
around here), no electricity (well, it just came back to the house after
two days off. After an hour, the house is now a balmy 50 degrees), and the
entire area encased in ice.

Sounds good. You could also try and find 924/944 steel wheels (w/VW-style
hubcaps!) but I doubt they are generally available where you are.

One thing I was going to investigate is using 4 spare tire wheels. (Some
models have steel rims, others alloy). Assuming the bead pattern is the
same, it *should* work. <shrug>

FWIW, around here, Blizzak's rule for serious winter people (best on ice).
Truly extreme should go with the new Hakkapelita (best in deep snow, and
best for control "feel" on snow), and most people are fine with the
Guardex-600 (great in slush) or the Toyo Observ's. Surprisingly, the new
Michelin Alpin hasn't received great reviews.

The Blizzak dual-compound sounds worrisome at first, but realize once *any*
tire has worn to that depth it is going to be fairly useless in snow. Just
don't slide the tire about in the dry (very easy to do) and it will last a
half-decent time. This is the fourth season for my Blizzaks (5k/year) and
they're at 75%. I was also doing great on my Toyo Observ G-02 (the
non-walnut-shell version, 2nd season) until I put a track day on them (long
story :-), and wore off about 10% of the tread in a couple of laps).

In the local rubber-to-ice slalom series (yes, we autocross here all year
long, but we're stupid that way), Blizzaks and Hakka's are the only real
choices. I will be contesting this year on the Toyo's because I found them
much easier to control in handbrake turns with the Swift. :-)
