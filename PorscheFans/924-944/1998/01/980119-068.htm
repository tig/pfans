I've hit two curbs in my life.

The first was in a '68 Mercury Montego, and the control arm bent. At $65,
the control arm was worth more than the car at the time, so I got the
wreckers to take the car away and they *gave* me $50.

The second was in my then brand-new 924S. I plead ignorance, I was turning
right onto a strange road on a freak October snowstorm. This is two weeks
after I've bought the car. I decided to see how badly the car really
understeered. I remember thinking, "Okay, now I'll lift off the throttle
and the car should stop plowing" and then THONK! "Hey! There's a median
there! What the ()*&()& is a median doing there!" The median was
snow-covered and thus invisible. (The median now sports a series of
reflector-festoon poles to alert the ignorant. Remember, this is Ottawa,
Canada's capital, where on some roads the power poles are on the *road*
side of the curb, making travel in the curb lane a slalom.) After the
initial shock, I thought, "I know this feeling, the control arm is bent.
Good thing I have the old-style steel control arm and not the fancy
aluminium ones. This isn't going to cost much. I won't bother reporting it."

Of course, the control-arm was (and still is) just fine. The rim was bent
(unique 924S offset, no used available, must buy new), the ball-joint was
toast, the valence was damaged and the fender distorted (damage virtually
unnoticeable), and the spindle (THE SPINDLE!) was bent. $3000.

The next year, I had the singular pleasure of being the first person in
Canada to experience the infamous oil cooler seal problem. After some
screaming and waving of magazine articles, the importer picked up the
repair cost.

The year after that, the car was parked on a street minding its own
business when an errant truck tire/wheel assembly decided to attack the
right-rear quarter panel. I came out of the restaurant just in time to see
the truck's owners pulling away, after carefully removing all evidence.

The year after that, I spun Number 2 rod bearing. Totally annoyed with the
car, I put it away for two years.

Finally get the car back on the track again having rebuilt the motor.  At
the last event of the year, get a toc-toc-toc noise. "Hmm. I know that
toc-toc-toc noise. Its No. 2 rod bearing again. This time I'll fix it
myself." Tow car home, pull motor (major pain if you don't have a garage),
and what do you know? Rod bearings are fine. Nuts. Get totally annoyed with
car, leave it in pieces. (still in pieces, third year now and I don't give
a flying f***)

Last year, buy used S2. Works okay, but for some reason I can't fit in it
with a helmet on. (I had no problem in the 924S). Oh well. At least I got
to put this car away for the winter (as opposed to having the car force
itself into winter storage).

Two weeks ago, the worst ice storm in many a year hits the area. Many trees
fall down, much damage. A tree in my backyard breaks in half and just
manages to land on the roof of the S2. Damage is minor enough to make it
not worth reporting...

I think I'm going back to $50 junk cars. 

<sigh>
