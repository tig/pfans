I too had trouble finding a battery for my 944s2 ... I tried buying (and 
subsequently returned) a DieHard from Sears -- I really wanted that 900 
ccm monster. Problem with the DieHard is that the battery terminals are 
on the wrong ends for the 944, and the cabled won't reach.  I thought 
about buying these nice battery cables from performance products, but I 
was in a pinch.   I too got a battery from Pep Boys, and am so far happy 
with the purchase.  Pep Boys apparently has something like a 72 month 
warranty .... I think my old Interstate only had 42 month warranty.

I learned (the hard way, ouch!) that unshielded positive battery terminals
near the negative grounds mysteriously attract metallic tools in your
hand, and spark something fierce.  If any of you out there do not have
your positive terminal shielded, please do so ....
