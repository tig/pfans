You know that's funny, I remember a guy sitting at the start for an
Auto-X and not going anywhere due to the shaft un-bolting and dropping
down when he popped the clutch.

The reason they work out is ready for this "CV-Grease". No mater how
well you clean the bolts, or the plate there is some grease there and CV
grease is very high in sulfur which keeps it in the joint and on
anything it touches.

As you may or not know I am now in the CV-grease business having bought
a major pail of it, and now reselling it in qt containers. The first
time I filled a container I used a pancake turner from the kitchen
assuming I could just clean it off and put it back in kitchen. No way
that stuff sticks like glue to everything. So now I have a grease packer
and no pancake turner.


----- Sales pitch follows --------------------
BTW: if you want some it's $15.50 a qt shipped anywhere in the US via
Priority mail (2nd day)

	Subject:	CV Joints

	Some personal experience and suggestions:


	CV Joints and the 951:

	Porsche changed the CV joints and half shafts for the 951 during
the 1987
	model year.  The parts booklet provides the VIN changeover
information.  On my
	‘87 951 which had the earlier style, I recently bought two used
half shafts,
	and changed over to the later-style joints.  I am not sure
whether the later
	joints are superior, but I needed new CVs anyway, and the half
shafts were not
	expensive.  The boots on the later-style joints are different as
well.

	When changing or re-lubricating the CV joints, I usually replace
the
	transmission fluid, and if necessary the outer transmission
flange seals.  I
	had a problem from time to time with these leaking on my
original ‘84 944
	years ago, but so far no issues with any of the Turbo cars.  I
have used
	Swepco gear lube for 10 years in 944 and 951 gearboxes, per the
suggestion of
	Bruce Anderson.  I have no complaints.

	I have been using Redline’s CV grease in the CV joints for
several years.  I
	have noticed that on the Turbo cars, the inner CV bolts have a
tendency to
	back out.  So far this is only true on my ‘87, which is used for
AX and track
	driving in addition to commuting.  During the last competition
season, the
	problem got so bad that I had to re-tighten the bolts each day
at the track.
	I have not been able to figure out what caused this.

	My first attempted solution was to use mild Loctite on the
bolts.  I had
	already changed over to new allen head bolts of the right
strength grade.  I
	also made certain that the threads on the bolts and in the
flanges were
	absolutely clean of any grease by using a solvent.

	Well, the Loctite didn’t work.  Then I got a suggestion from a
friend who has
	a 911 repair business.  He suggested that I use some special
ribbed and dished
	lock washers.  These are called for in the microfiche for
several 911 and 914
	CV joint applications.  I bought some of these washers at the
dealer.

	Since I was tired of fooling with the joints, I decided to add
one more
	precaution-- safety wire.  I understand that this method is
sometimes used by
	the pros, including the guys from Porsche AG.  I bought the
special pliers and
	drilled the heads of the 24 bolts on a drill press, and wired
‘em together.
	Now, with the wire, the washers, and some mild Loctite,
hopefully they won’t
	back out.

	There is still no explanation for my problem with the bolts
backing out.  The
	gearbox and its mounts are fine, and we are careful with the
drivetrain.  The
	only thing I can think of is that maybe the characteristics of
the Redline
	grease are such that it wicks into the threads easier than
normal moly grease.
	Who knows?  I have a few more track tests to run, but I think my
problem is
	solved.

	As an aside, there are several people offering race-style CV
boots for Porsche
	and BMW.  These are more expensive than the factory/aftermarket
style (as much
	as $25-50 each), but are shaped to keep more grease in the
joint.  At least
	one vendor claims that what he sells are March Indy car boots.
Someday I may
	try these if the price comes down a bit.

	If you drive your car on the track or in AX, include the CV
bolts in your
	inspection routine.  If they back out enough, you could have a
big problem.
