<< My 87 951 has developed a new problem with delivering full
 boost.  When the car is first started, it will readily make boost,
 but once the coolant has warmed up to the first white mark,
 the car decides that 1.2 bar is enough.  I don't know if it will
 actually reach full boost when cold as I prefer not to try that.
 I've only done short bursts in 2nd gear to see if it could do it
 at all.   >>

Could this be a knock problem?  Is it possible that when the engine is cold,
the cylinders and all the intake plumbing, etc. is cold so the charge
temperature is substantially cooler than when the engine begins to warm up?
If this were the case, the KLR would cut boost to deal with the knock.  Of
coures, if this WERE the case, you're problem would be one of many potential
contributers to knock (ignition timing, bad gas, ???)  This is an educated
wild guess, and probably reads like drivel.
