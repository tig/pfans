>Hello:
   The sprockets were never taken off, so this could not be the cause. I
insist that the marks may be wrong. I should remind you that before the
water pump was replaced the engine ran perfectly. I suspect that the
balance shafts were timed with another reference, of course the question
of which one?
    Also, can it be that the shafts themselves are bad, the engine ran
over 6000 km with the bad timing. What actually does the shaft do, where
does it go to, what does it turn? Can it be that it is not fulfilling
its purpose? Thanks.<

P.C.,
   What kind of car do you have that you can replace the water pump without
removing the balance shaft sprockets? On every 944 I've ever replaced a
water pump on, the sprockets had to be removed to get the rear timing cover
off to get to the water pump. Just curious.

To answer to question about what the balance shafts do. Each shaft has a
counter weight on it. The counterweights are aligned 180 degrees out of
sync with each other. Large in-line four cylinder engines inherently
produce large second order harmonic vibrations. The balance shaft turn the
counterweights at twice the rpm of the engine. With one located high on one
side of the engine and the other low on the opposite side of the engine, it
balances the vibrations of the large spinning mass inside the engine.

With the balance shaft belt off you can actually turn the shafts by hand
and feel if there is a problem with the alignment. It's a fairly lengthy
explanation though and I won't go into it unless you really want to hear
it.
