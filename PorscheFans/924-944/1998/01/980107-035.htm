I love Bosch Platinums - had 'em in my Mitsu. truck for over 70 kmi (on
one set!), and have had one set in my 924 for 23+ kmi. They just don't
break down! For a little bit more money initially, you can save a lot later! If
your engine in running properly, they won't make things much better,
except for maybe starting; however, if your engine's out of tune, they'll
make a much greater improvement (again, speaking from experience
here).

Oil Pan Gasket

If for some reason, you are going to drop the pan to repair a leaking gasket,
you should go ahead and change out the rod bearings and nuts.  This adds about
20 minutes of labor, and $20 of cost, and is very simple to perform.  No one I
know has recommended using RTV or anything else on the pan gasket, except for
smears of high temp RTV in the areas specified by the factory.  I recently
completed this project on my '87 951.

Oil in Intercooler Hoses and Pipes

Perfectly normal blow-by oil, described by Milledge in an Excellence tech
note.  Makes sense to remove the intercooler from time to time and flush it
out with brake kleen or another suitable solvent. While it is out, it makes
sense to clean out bugs and other debris.  Restores intercooler to maximum
efficiency.

Diagnosing Boost Problems

There is a good troubleshooting section on this in the factory manual
supplement.  This info, plus the diode tool it describes (about $20-30 at the
dealer) will help you solve your problems.  I have used mine several times.

Sears Batteries in 951

I have used Sears Die Hards in 944s and 951s for the past 10 years.  Recently,
I had to swith to an Optima in my '87 951 street/AX/track car.  The Sears
battery leaked.  At first I thought that maybe I had a voltage reg. or
alternator problem.  Nope.  Then I changed batteries three times.  They all
leaked.  These batteries are made by Exide.  The acid did some damage in my
car.  Sears paid for for the repairs, and gave me my money back for the
battery.  The leaking occured in AX and track driving, hence my switch to
Optima.  After a lot of fiddling and studying the problem, I have found a way
to mount the Optima without changing the factory wires, using a simple $5
battery mount kit.  If you want to know how, send me an e-mail.

Be careful with these Sears batteries.  The damage could cause a water leak
through the firewall and onto/into your KLR and/or DME.  Expensive.  A number
of mechanics and body shops I spoke with have described this leaking Sears
battery problem, so watch for it.  As an alternative for street cars, I have
head great reports on the Interstate batteries.
