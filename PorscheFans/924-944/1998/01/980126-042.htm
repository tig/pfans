I used to have a problem with the fans not coming on due to a blown 
fuse.  I replaced the fuse but it continually blew and the fans 
stopped.  The auto electrician didn't know what it was so he put in a 
special switch that would blow and after a short while reset itself . 
 This seemed to fix the problem until now.

Recently whilst getting the car serviced a hole was discovered in the 
radiator core.  Apparently this was fixable without replacing the 
radiator and I gave the OK.  However on my first decent drive 
subsequently the was running extremely hot about 7/8.  When I turned 
the air conditioner off it was better but still hotter than usual. 
 (Bare in mind that I live in Brisbane, Australia and it does get very 
hot here.)  Now even on a long trip sits at about 3 to 7/8.  This 
seems to be a time thing.  The fans seem to work on short trips but 
over half an hour or so and I seldom here them any more.  I am unable 
to use the air conditioner at all now, not that it was ever very good 
in mine.

Can anybody help with suggestions or ideas.
