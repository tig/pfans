Now here's a subject we can discuss for years.  Get the flame throwers
ready guys because here it comes.  The most historically significant
water-cooled Porsche? -----
The 928.  Think about it.  If it wasn't for the financial trouble
experience by Volkswagen, the 924 would have "VW" on the back of it instead
of "PORSCHE".  The 924 was a VG project designed by Porsche to be sold as a
VW.  Yes, the 924 was the first water-cooled car marketed by Porsche but,
design work for the 928 began before Porsche took over the 924 project from
VW in 1973. Anyway, the 928 was the first water-cooled Porsche designed
from the ground up to be a Porsche using Porsche parts.  Yes, the 944 and
968 share the same basic chassis with the 924 but, the significant change
from the 924 that made the 944 a success was the engine. And the engine was
based on design concepts from the 928. Don't get me wrong here. I think the
924 is a very fine automobile. I also think it's sad that because it's the
result of a joint effort between Porsche and VW, it will never get the
respect it deserves. However, as fanatical as I am about the entire
924/944/968 series, it is hard to deny the impact of the 928 on the
four-cylinder line.  Bring on the flames!
