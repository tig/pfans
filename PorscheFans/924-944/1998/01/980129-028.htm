Subject: How did they get 500 hp out of 2.5 liter (NV)?
Did I read it right? The same 2.5 liter engine block that produces 150-200
hp in the 944 has a version that puts out 500 hp? Does NV stand for
Nitrofueled Velociraptor? Seriously, what all did the NV have that allowed
that?

Perhaps your referencing a different post than mine of a week ago, but I had
mentioned the 924 GTP race car campaigned by the factory at Lemans in 1981
that generated 500hp. In David Nivian's book, Porsche 924/928/944/968 (also
confirmed in Michael Cottons book) he discusses it in more detail, but first
remember we're talking about a turbo charged RACE motor. And this one was
pretty unique... 16V head with cross-flow cooling (production cars had
lengthwise coooling) and both cams were driven by the same belt (production
cars drove one cam and a chain between cams), in addition being the first to
use a computer to control nearly all primary engine functions (Injection,
ignition, fuel flow, boost pressure and knock sensing). It raced Lemans at
425hp running 1.2bar boost, but would develop 500hp at 1.5bar.

But 500hp wasn't the 'limit" for the 2.5L for race motors. These books also
talk about Al Holbert's development of the 944 Turbo generating 525HP and
600+HP in 1985 and 1986! And according the Jeff Stone at KMR in Madison,
2.8L and 3.0L turbo charged race motors develop 650-700HP -- and require a
complete rebuild every 20 hours. They have a 968 in-house right now that is
developing that kind of power.

Oh, to have such deep pockets...
