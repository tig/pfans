Gone through that on already. Check if the belt shows signs of single-
sided wear. The shop who changed the belt tried to adjust the tension,
but it didn't help. I tried it myself and found the abnormal wear.
I went to special electric shop and they said the alternator is mis-
aligned. They corrected it in 2 minutes, didn't charge me anything
and got a new customer.

A neighbour used to have one, usually he started the thing at 5am...

Hope this helps
