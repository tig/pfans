It is magnetic.  The ABS sensor is a magnetic pickup.  It uses the toothed hoop
that is pressed around the hub to determine the speed of a wheel.

I suppose too many shavings could affect the readings of the pickup.  I'd guess
that the ABS light would come on because the pickup would be inconsistent with
the rest of the car.

As for your ABS working.  Seems fine to me.  If your smoothly braking, then
your ABS is not engaged.  If your brakes are grabbing then releasing then it is
working.  The ABS unit gives off a humm when engaged.  You'll here it coming
from under the dash on the passengers side.
