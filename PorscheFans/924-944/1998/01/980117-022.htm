P-Fans,

A while back there was a thread on V-6 engines and although it's probably a
dead horse by now, I ran across a reprint of the March 1982 issue of Motor
Trend where Don Fuller had this to say:

"The family engine concept, by the way, is important for more than just
manufacturing reasons. Emission and performance work is done on special
single-cylinder engines used for combustion chamber development. Thus
anything learned on the singles can then be applied to all engines with the
family."

"Since the new engine was to be based on the 928, there were two possible
configurations: a 90 degree V-6 of about 3.5 liters, or an inline four of
approximately 2.5 liters. You know the result. But a V-6 certainly seemed
the more interesting choice -- more powerful, anyway. A
Peugeot/Renault/Volvo 2.7 liter V-6 was shoehorned into a 924 in 1976. It
just didn't work. Shoehorn is an apt description of its fit, and any 928
derivative could hardly be expected to be much better. Porsche engineers
didn't like the vibrations, either. And it turned out the concept of a 3.5
liter 924 was too heavy -- both in engine mass and additional structure to
support it -- to meet projected weight classes and economy levels. Finally,
and this is a Big One for manufacturing, the 924 is assembled with the
engine/driveshaft/transaxle coming in from below as a unit. The V-6 would
have had to drop in from the top, requiring a rethink of the entire assmbly
procedure and probably major redesign of several important components."

The main article was a comparison between the new 944NA and the 931 or 924
Turbo. Priced at $18,450, the 944NA fell right between the 924 at $16,900
and the 931 at $21,500, yet performance wise it was nearly a dead match for
the 931. The 944 had the slightest edge in most categories, but the
differences were very slight. These stats will list the 944 first: weight
was 2778 vs 2779;  1/4 mile was 15.89 @85.8 vs 15.94 @84.70;  0-60 was 7.74
vs 7.67;  slalom was 7.77 @ 61.44 vs 7.78 @ 61.36;  and on a short track
46.64 @ 61.74 vs 46.81 @ 61.52 even though the 944 carried more rubber.
Braking was the one area the 944 soundly won out with 60mph in 140ft vs
151ft and they felt the tires were an important reason why.

All this info came from the Brooklands Books Porsche 944 Gold Porfolio
1981-1991 where they've assembled 47 reprints of road tests conducted
throughout the English speaking countries during those years. Some of you
mentioned having saved magazines with additional road tests and I for one
would really love to get photo copies of some of them. If anyone has Turbo S
tests and is willing to share copies I would certainly be willing to cover
all your costs. Drop me a note!

TIA
