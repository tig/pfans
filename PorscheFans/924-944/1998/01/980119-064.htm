Hi Everybody....

I Love my 1990, Porsche 944 Turbo although it has
been a
real pain in the you-know-where since new.

Apart from a range of annoying little,
intermittent faults and its habit
of regularly stripping the sun-roof activation
gears, it has recently
developed a more serious illness.

One evening I went to drive home after work and
had great difficulty
selecting 1st gear... ok, so I could take off in
another gear. At each
stop I still couldn't get it into 'first' without
using brute force, and then
found difficulty shifting through the lower gears
without double
clutching for each gear change.  Next day
everything was ok again.

After a week or so the same problem developed -
for no apparent
reason - and the fault again cleared without
intervention. Each time
I notified Porsche Australia... they looked and
said all is ok with
the car.... but, I'm sure they thought I had a
more personal problem.

Everything was fine for a couple of months until
the malady struck
again.. this time with a vengeance and the car was
virtually immobilised.
 The fault appeared and cleared several more times
until New Year
when it came to stay.

It appears to be a clutch problem whereby an
undetermined  amount of power
is still being transmitted to the wheels even
though the clutch is fully actuated.

It is now impossible to any gear with the engine
running but the selectors
work fine with the engine inactive. I can select
first gear ok and then start the
engine (clutch thrown) and my little red car
struggles down the driveway all
on its own.... clutch still thrown out... so to
speak.

The fault is not clearing this time and with the
engine running I cannot select
even 4th or 5th cogs.

The car has only covered a mere 50,000, loving
kilometres and, by this time,
I'm pretty disappointed with the whole shooting
match.

Any ideas out there in Porsche Fans Land?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts.

Regards.....    Ken.
