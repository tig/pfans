I'll try to keep the messages short and focused this time. Next weekend
I hope to replace the speedometer cable, which I finally verified is shot.
'Sokay, the tach and the radar detector have continued to work just fine.

Anyway, I've followed the cable as far as I can inside the dash, and all
the way through the engine compartment. I have two concerns:

1) Any tricks to getting the end of the cable through the hub assembly?
   Do I have to take anything apart once I have the wheel (and the C clip)
   off, or do I just keep pulling? And I just push and hope nothing blocks
   the new cable?

2) I noted that I couldn't quite be sure I could follow the speedo cable
   all the way to the firewall last time I had the instrument cluster out.
   I thought I could use high test monofilament or nylon line tied to the
   end as I pulled the old cable out through the dash, then use the same
   line to pull the new cable in. Sound workable? Better ideas?

Any tips/hints greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
--Steve.
