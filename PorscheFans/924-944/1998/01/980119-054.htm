I just wrote:

I have just faxed off a little note to Speed Bleeder Products in Lemont, Il
(west of Chicago) asking if they have an application chart/cross-reference
for Porsches.  I explained to them that I would post to the list any
information they could supply (and, I mentioned that this 924-944-968 list
alone had about 1600 members).  I think that should get some kind of rapid
response (there is power in numbers).  As soon as I hear anything, I will
let you know.  Who knows, maybe I can make a deal with them for bulk
purchases (although, at only $6-7 each, there probably isn't a whole lot of
room, but, you never can tell).

======================================================

Well, talk about response.  Not long after I posted the above, I received a
phonecall from Mike @ Speed Bleeder Products.  He says that there are 3
sizes which fit most Porsches (7mm x 1"; 10mm x 1"; 8mm x 1.25").
Unfortunately, he couldn't tell me which specific models take which size,
but he did say that he could probably cross them over according to Porsche
part number.....so, I just faxed him a copy of the page from the Automotion
catalog.  That should give him something to work on.

Incidentally, he said he is leaving for vacation tomorrow, but would try to
get me some info yet this evening.  Otherwise, it will have to wait til he
returns in a week.  He did mention that he has sold over 100,000 bleeders
in the past year, ranging from trucks to motorcycles to tractors.

More to come when I get it.
