Hi PorscheFans!

We are delighted with our "new",  US specs 944S. Minor flaws (motor mounts,
shocks) have been corrected. Belt and ancillaries were revised by "Balta"
(the wise, affordable alternative for Porsche Spain,  here in Madrid area).
Only tires remain to be changed.

When inspecting thoroughly "what have bought", I've discovered something
(for me) amazing:

Headlights have not lamps! No bulbs! All the unit is enclosed, sealed...

My son Miguel, who  shares with me the car says that all US cars are like
that.

I've been driving rented cars in the US (Taurus, Town Car, etc...) but I
never was aware of this detail. Now some questions....

Life expectancy of those sealed units is higher that the European H-4 lamp
based standard?

Is it easy to  replace the US headlights for more familiar H-4 units, say
Hella.  (According to our traffic regulations, you must carry one spare
unit for all lamps)

Best regards from sunny and cold Madrid (Spain)

Antonio Munoz T.
