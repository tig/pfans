Patrick, I am somewhat of a newbie too, having just aquired a 87 924S for next
to nothing from sis, and it was in way way better shape than this thing is. To
make a long story short, I would not even consider taking this thing off his
hands for more than a thousand bucks, and would not even recommend that. You
could easily find a very nice looking version that old for 5K, that running
fine and fun to drive right now and STILL have to put 1500 bucks into it in
parts alone just to make it a truly dependable ride. Not being able to drive
it at all leaves engine, brakes, steering, transmission, everything basically
as a chance. The parts on these are so expensive that sweat equity really
means only sweat-not-losing-your-shirt., Don't get me wrong, I like th cars,
and don't mind a challenge, but just ask yourself this, after you fix the
engine, how much will water pump, belt and roller kit, brake job and oh say a
clutch add up to, just in parts. Answer 1.5K I'm not even taking windshield
and body into account. You could spend 10 grand on this thing and it would
still only be worth 5. Find a nice one, tell this guy good luck. -
