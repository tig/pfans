I would suggest starting with the mechanisms in the roof first. Check your fuses just in case, but if you have the older version of the sunroof (with the third, white box in the middle) then possibly the gear inside just needs to be put back into alignment. My sunroof system also completely stopped working and just needed the gear to be repositioned, of course I have to replace a broken piece as well (thank you body/paint shop), so the mechanism isn't currently in my car...
As for locking the sunroof down, I can't really offer much advise, my sunroof hasn't been locked down of the passenger side for about 5 months because it wouldn't lift, and as a result that side lifts at any speed above 60mph, but if I lower the windows, then it lifts at 75-80mph. I would just remove the roof unless it rains or such. If nothing is broken, you can repair the whole system in one day. I went in with no manuals or anything and assembled/dis-assembled the system two times in about eight hours, but I also spent time trying to figure out a way to repair my broken piece. 
So designate a sunday to fix it and you should be set. Let me know if you have anymore questions.

On a more personal note, do we all recieve jealous and dirty looks for driving nice cars, or is it just me being a teenager too. I get the most evil stares, and hve even had people yell nasty things(although only a few times).Oh yeah, and I should be setting up my website within the week, so I'll post the address once its up.
