I have no trouble lifting both front and rear tires on my
968 by using the rear jack point.  When the rear is about
8 to 10 inches off the ground the front will lift.

<< One comment I found puzzling in
 the article was to do more coasting.  I assume this means setting up for
 early apexing and early acceleration out of a corner, but it seems to

 hard on the throttle. >>

Carrol Smith addresses this in one of his "...to Win"  books (either Tune to
Win or Drive to Win -- both are excellent).  Coasting, in this context, means
a steady throttle, rather than no throttle -- just enough to overcome inertia,
friction, aero drag, etc. so as to keep the car at a constant speed.
Typically, you'll do this in the part of a turn where you're generating
maximum cornering force, which requires that you not be generating any
acceleration or braking forces (typically, the segment just before the apex). 
By the way, this doesn't contradict Barry Lenoble's comments in a related post
regarding keeping the throttle down in certain types of turns (this track
driving stuff is complicated -- that's what makes it fun!).  Barry's
addressing the need under certain conditions to settle the rear suspension and
increase the vertical load on the rear tires to increase their grip.

hey all,

can anyone illustrate the differences between a 87 924S and the 87 924?
specs show the 924S with about 8hp less, as well as the obvious body work
differences , but i 'm interested in which parts interchange with the 944
(years?)

thanks,
eric (ericj001@aol.com)
78-924 brandywine, glad i bought the foglights ....
87-924S "the new child"  :)
