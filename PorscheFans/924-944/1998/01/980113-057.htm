Hi Eric,

The 924S was initally sold with a slightly detuned 944 engine so it did
not walk all over the more expensive 944 model in road tests. If my
memory serves me correct it uses the Aluminium arms from the 85.5 944
with the bigger offset (hence the Teledial wheels). The brake discs from
a standard 85.5 944 will fit. Not sure about the earlier car. Michael
Bremer on the PPPI list my be able to advise what easy upgrades are
available.


924S Euro at launch:
2.5l engine, 150PS, Comp. ratio 9.7:1, DME, digital engine control unit,
load free gas 91ROZ,
(rear axle from the 944, from August 87)
Modelyear 88 some changes
2.5l engine, 160PS, Comp. ratio 10.2:1, DME, digital engine control
unit,
load free gas 95 ROZ, Catalytic Converter possible,

Nils
	It sounds like you have a vacuum leak somewhere. Follow your ears for the
hissing sound and you will find it. Whith the engine running, you can use a
can of BrakeKleen by CRC NON-FLAMABLE, and spray around the intake boots,
injector seals, vacuum lines, ect... When the engine stumbles, you have found
the leak. Check all the vacuum lines first, fuel reg/dampner, manifold
connections, turbo intake and charged output (the big black boots) for leaks. 
	You could also buy one of those cheap doctors stesescope or use a small
tubbung one side up to ear (remember what your momy said about putting things
into your ear!) and the other on any suspected leaking plubming. 

		Good Luck, DavidJalai@aol.com

Subject: rough at idle


     I have a 89 944na with a recently developed rough idle. Replaced cap & 
     rotor which didnt do anything for idle. The car is mis-firing but as 
     soon as gas is given the car runs fine. Some further details are, w/ 
     hood open and listening to car at idle there seems to be a sucking 
     sound, at the rough idle. As soon as gas is given teh sucking sound 
     goes away. Does anyone think that it couls be one of the injector 
     seals? or the injector itself. I have also put injector cleaneer the 
     latest tank of gas but this hasn't done anything. 
     
     Has anyone had similar problems? What wat the fix?
     
     Thanks in advance,

Dan:  sounds like the dreaded idle speed control is stuck.  It's the little
can shaped object that has vacuum tubes running into and out of it.  It's
located under the intake manifold on most 944's (not sure about the S).  Some
people take them out and clean them, but I replaced mine.  A Bosch part that I
paid about $125 for about three years ago.  Before buying one, you might try
taking yours out and cleaning it for a short term fix to verify that's the
problem.

Luck!

I took my S2 crankshaft down to Motor Works today to have it magnafluxed and
otherwise checked out. Trying to make sure it's in good shape before I sell
it. The block it came out of had the sleeve cracked. I was very surprised to
learn they had found a source for the sleeves and could sleeve a cylinder for
under $400. 

I thought my block was a throw away. Does resleeving the cylinder sound like a
good idea out there?
