My 86 951 has been in two shops over the past month to diagnose a 
problem. 
The car loses power after it has been on full boost for 5 seconds.  
Power will not
return until the throttle is lifted.  When re applying power it will 
only take 1.2 bar
without the problem reappearing.   The problem only shows up at the 
track and
is infinitely repeatable.  The car runs fine on the street and has 
stock chips and
turbo.

The following items have been tested or replaced.
Fuel Pressure - ok
Spark - ok
Boost - ok, not going into an over boost condition
Most vacuum lines replaced - no change in problem
Turbo boost timer delay valve replaced - no change
Throttle position switch replace - no change
Two sets of DME and KLR computers swapped in and out of car - no 
change

If the knock sensor is taken out of the circuit, the problem goes 
away.  However,
when replacing the knock sensor with a new one, the problem returns.

The shop is telling me the head needs to come off to see what is 
going on inside
the engine.  What factors could cause the engine to knock?  Are their 
any more 
suggestions or tests that should be performed before removing the 
head?
