<< I responded directly and said I would report my oil 
 consumption as I also thought it was getting quite high on my 944 with 
 over 139000 miles.
 
 Well, some initial results are as follows:
 
 		1) around town and very short trips, I find that I use 
 		   about a quart of oil for every 250-300 miles.
 
 		2) on longer hauls, like this weekends Porsche tour to 
 		   San Simeon and back, I used only 1/3 quart after 
 		   almost 700 miles of 65-85 crusining and some short 
 		   areas of close to 100.  >>

I'd also like to know what others experience.  I have a '84 944na with 127K
miles.  I use Castrol GTX 20W-50 and experience virtually no oil usage between
oil changes.  The car is used mostly around town and short trips but I have
occasionally taken it on drives of about 500 miles.

The only oil I use is with vinegar on a salad!
