I understand the 944 has understeer characteristics. Also that V rated tires
are stickier (made of softer rubber) and are typically mounted on 944 cars
and are rated for continuous driving at or a little over 150 mph. And that
the next rating down is rated for 120 mph approx. and not as soft a rubber.

Given that here on Maui it is close to impossible to find a place (with a
reasonable degree of safety) to get up to 120 mph, much less hold that
speed, I'm wondering if it might be a wise choice to put the next rating
down (120 mph) tires on the rear of the car. Save a little money, maybe get
better tire mileage, and maybe with a little less stickiness on the rear
even out the steering characteristics.

I'd like to hear from anyone who has tried it what resulted. And if there is
a downside to this, what it is.
