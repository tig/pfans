The silver 968, car 37, is a 3.0 litre, turbocharged car built by Eric 
Barrett of Barret, Inc. in Edison NJ.  It was driven by Dick Howe, Jim 
Loftis, Bob Strange, and I believe Dave White.  Jim and Dick are well 
known to the PCA Club Racing world, and Bob and Dave did a bunch of 
Firehawk and other series in past years.  The car qualified pretty well 
in GT3, but dropped out with transmission problems.

I don't know anything about the red 944 Turbo that ran.  He didn't do a 
lot of laps during Friday practice and qualifying, and I don't recall 
seeing a lot of him during the race.

I, along with a bunch of Northeast Region folks, crewed for the #77 
Greycliff Racing car, a GT3 911.  This car is owned by Mark Greenberg, 
who some of you may know from a few years back when he campaigned a 
very pink 911 in Club Racing.  Mark picked up the #5 944GTR a few years 
ago and has been driving it more recently in PCA and vintage events. 
 We also had Beran Peter, Dave Friedman, John Drew, and Jim Nelson 
driving.  Some of you may remember Beran from Porschephiles when he was 
a newbie looking to buy a 944 Turbo.  Dave and his dad Jerry have been 
PCA Club Racing for a bunch of years.  Dave was a late addition to the 
roster and his name has not appeared in any of the official tallies 
I've seen.

We qualified well and finished 6th in class, 13th overall.  We were 3rd 
in class for much of the event, but lost a little time and position in 
the pits toward the end with a minor clutch hydraulics problem.
