Hi Clark!
        Well I guess I have just you to thank, I was called by my 
mechanic (Mercedes-Benz) yesterday and asked me if I knew what the 
problem was, I immediately went over to the garage and an hour after 
wards, and after explain what you had told me, the car was/is running as 
smooth as it ever did.
        I will be leaving on Wednesday to London, I will be driving 
there, obviously, maybe I will to all the way to Ireland, or Scotland, 
with the car running this good I just have to drive!
        Again thank you very much.


P.S. My hand break barely catches on, the brakes pads are ok, can the it 
be adjusted somehow?
