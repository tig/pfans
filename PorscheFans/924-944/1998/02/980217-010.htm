........just curious, intermittent.......could check on the actual
terminal lugs' contacts to see if they could be corroded or simply
slack. My '83 944na has the horns mounted underneath the left front
apron/airdam, just forward of the wheel well. Bad location if you ask me
but after looking around under the front end, it doesn't seem like
there's any room to locate them otherwise! If the horn contacts are fine
even w/ a light brushing w/ a steel brush to remove oxidation, follow
your wires up to the harness to check for breakage. Maybe the horn relay
is the culprit. Another horn problem I had, not dealing w/ the same prob
as yours, was that my horn would activate intermittently by itself when
I would turn the steering wheel or activate the wiper stalk. After
removing the steering wheel, it turns out to be a flat-head screw had
came loose, not to mention that the plastic it screws into was stripped
out. This was one of the three retaining screws for holding the turning
indicator/wiper switch assembly in place. It jiggled loose and acted as
a ground to the steering wheel and make my horns sound off. Remedy: I
insulated those bad boys in w/ silicone caulking or RTV. Hey, it worked.
