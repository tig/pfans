Patrick: the 16v head helps the engine breathe easier. So the only time
you will "feel" any difference in power is high up on the RPM range,
when the 8v head is beginning to run out of air. In other words the 944S
was not designed to improve low-RPM response or power over the 8v 944.
This is a completely biased opinion, but I have always felt that either
Porsche _really_ underrated the 8v 944 (147hp US) or it _really_
overrated the 16v (188hp US) because when you drive the two cars those
extra 40 horses are certainly well hidden!

Comparing the two cars, the 8v takes off from 0mph much more willingly
and pulls stronger than the 16v. This must be a function of the shorter
final driver ratio of the 8v. After 80mph the 16v is supposed to have
more reserve power since it goes all the way up to an indicated 142mph
(compared to the 8v 131mph) but as with any high speed comparison it was
difficult for me to "feel" any difference in acceleration between the
two cars, after 80mph.

Of course a 944 always reflects the treatment it has received in the
past, so this may not have been a fair comparison. However my 8v 944
felt definitely more willing at every speed range upto 100mph, than the
16v I compared it to. This could still be the effect of the taller 16v
gearset making itself felt, and perhaps in the 110mph+ range the 16v
will come into its own. A well-maintained early 8v 944 (with the shorter
final drive) will make short work of 0-130mph and does not stop pulling
real hard until about 120mph.

Of course this whole comparison is a "seat-of-the-pants" deal -- check
the numbers in the FAQ to see how a brand new 8v performs against a
brand new 16v. Good luck!
