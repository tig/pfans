Okay guys/gals, I've been hesitant to ask this question
because I just shelled out some bucks to get my cam
housing gasket, etc... replaced and I really don't want
to hear any bad new right know (I know my wife
wouldn't like it) but I have to find out if I have a
problem.....

I drive about 14 miles round trip a day to work, albeit
mostly highway miles, I too have noticed
condensation on the oil cap which I don't have a
problem with, but I do have a small amount of "froth"
around the top (not the tip) of the oil dipstick.  The
color of the "froth" is like that of whipped cocoa (i.e.,
light brown or beige).  Is this a problem?  Since I drive
mostly highway miles, the oil pressure indicates the 
normal 4-5 and at idle between 2-3.

I have 97K miles on the car now and the oil cooler
seals were replaced with the updated ones at 57K
and there is no sign of oil in the coolant.  In fact, like I
said, the cam housing was resealed and I had the
coolant flushed at the same time a couple weeks ago.
 If there was something wrong, I know my mechanic
would have said something, but since he hasn't,  I
was assuming everything was okay.  In fact, he said
my car is in really nice shape.  I change my oil
religiously every 3K miles and never notice anything
but dirty oil.

Any insights would be appreciated!
