I just stumbled across a web page
( www.cbaexp.com/carroll/porsche/index.htm ) with an entirely different
perspective from most of us on the list, and thought it interesting enough
to pass it along.  Of particular interest is the "lemon report" which
various people make less than glowing reports about 944-924's and particular
troubles that they have had with their Porsches.

Maybe I missed the point somewhere along the way, but I always assumed that
getting a Porsche would be a bit of a money sucking, high maintenance habit.
I didn't buy it because I thought it would be cheap, I bought it because I
wanted one, and I thought it would be fun, not just to drive, but to work on
and get to know.  I thought there was a lot of pride in ownership in having
one, and doing what work I can on my own makes it that much more a part of
me.  So far, my car has lived up to my expectations, and I wouldn't trade it
for another.

Two comments that I saw over and over on Caleb's page were the submarine
effect of the air intake, and oil cooler failures, neither of which I have
seen anyone on this list comment on in the 3 months of so that I have been
receiving it.  Anyone had similar problems?

Regards, ...Scott
'84 944 ( which I sent a picture for inclusion on Roxy's page, if you'd care
to see it)
