Hi,

I sit here today at 1:00am at my desk at home and am feeling a bit distressed
about the world.  I left work today at my usual time and had an eery feeling.
I decided to take a different route down in case car jackers or something
were waiting for me to take my usual path.

Upon dis-arming my car from a long distance away, I immediately noticed the
unusual flash pattern, I've seen three before (shock sensor), but never
four flashes!  It was very clear what four flashes meant, glass breakage
sensor.  Some sewer rat broke my passenger window and stole my cheap-sh*t
CD player from a mall parking lot right under the Security's nose.

My car is parked at the bottom of the mall escalators (the tower I work
in is above).  Anyone walking down will see my car there.  Even the
Security have fallen in love with my car and admitted that they keep
a special eye on the Porsches and until today, never had one cracked open.

They think this was more a "rush" theft, rather than a monetary theft, 
something about getting into a Porsche as being somewhat of a rush.

When I bought my CD player, after having no stereo for 11 months, I
asked the clerk for the cheapest CD player money could buy, something
that even the lowest life form wouldn't risk damaging their hand over.
HA!  I overestimated the junkies' morality levels.

At least, the prick left behind $600 worth of Oakleys.  The CD player
was only worth $200, or $149 on sale!  I installed it myself so there
goes another evening.  I had taken special pains to ensure it was 
installed perfectly with the highest grade connectors, etc.  But, oh
well.  Sometimes, I feel like driving some junker around, but then
that's what these rats want me to do, so I won't.

I don't know what I could have done to prevent this.  I had an excellent
alarm that went off as it should have, probably saved my Oakleys, the
ADS speakers and my car itself.  I have the factory alarm wired in too,
so no starting for sure.  The CD player was as cheap as it could be,
the only thing being that it was non-faceplate.

My passenger door is slightly damaged from the mutants attempts to pry
the window out ala Honda Civic.  Fortunately, he finally gave that route
up and just thumped his rock hard head through it and finished the job.
If I have to replace the door because of this moron, I will be pissed.
In B.C., repainting a door means you lose big time re-sale value, like
in the order of $4000-$5000 on a $28,000 car.  People here just don't
like cars that have been touched by a body shop.

Anyhow, I had no real reason to write this email.  I just got tired of
ragging on Paul about how the world can really stink just as you were
starting to smell the roses of life.

Farzaan.
