So I decided to take my freshly washed/scrubbed/polished/waxed 944 out for
a road trip up to Santa Barbara along Pacific Coast Highway today.  On the
trip I came across numerous other Pcars (over 10 I'd guess), only two of
which weren't 911's (A Boxter and 944).  If at all possible I tried to
wave, or flash, or some other little gesture of Pcar appriciation.  And
din't get a single response.  Notta one.  Most cases I was sure they say me
too.  Most of this was around the Santa Manica and Malibu area, so I
attribute it to the typical snobbiness <sp?> of the residents.  Especially
the 911 drivers, who as someone mentioned before, probably didn't even know
my 944 was a Porsche.  Nonetheless, it was a little disappointing.  Another
factor may be there are so many Pcars around here.  I even dare to say I
see more of them than Camaros and Vettes most days.

But something else that came up on the trip....  It was dusty along the
road, and I got thirsty.  So I stopped at a gas station, grabbed a Diet
Coke, and realized I had no palce to put it in the car!  So I was thinking,
since that tape holder lid is busted anyway (altohugh usable thanks to the
winderful invention of Velcro(tm)), maybe that could be replaced by a piece
with a hole or two for holding drinks.  I've plastic vacuum and injection
molding equipment for pieces about that size, but wasn't sure what the
depth was.  Is it possible to go any deeper than the tray is now?
Otherwise I can raise the height a bit, but if it looks too tacky, I won't
even bother.

Hope your weekend is as sunny as mine!
