Well, Doug, I did have an ABC patch on my old driving suit.  As far as the
ball bag is concerned, it still contains the bowling ball - fits real
nicely in the spare tire well (which, incidentally, keeps the ball from
rolling around too much in the turns).  And, I think the only time you
would see four of us dressed like this at the track would be if we were
running in an endurance race..........team spirit, and such.  Oh, btw, the
shoes have our car number on them instead of the size.
