Does this also mean that most 944 owners remove the (lower) engine cover when
changing the oil?  Otherwise it seems that the oil would collect on top of the 
cover and make more of a mess.  I was just wondering since the car would
have to be
on jack stands to do this.

While replacing my power steering hoses recently (to fix a leak) I noticed that 
the lower engine cover on my '87 944 was filthy!  I cleaned it but am now
wondering 
if other mechanics that have worked on the vehicle take the time to do this.
Any comments?
