so eloquently stated:

>What do you mean by relay kit?  I am a novice with electricity but do =
want=20
>to upgrade to Hella lights.  I have an 89 951 with sylvania sealed =
beams.=20
> I noticed that automotion has H4s with the 55/60 bulb for about $40 =
each,=20
>is this a good deal and is this the part I want?  What about euro =
Porsche=20
>part numbers, do you have access to those or are the actually Hella H4s?

=46or normal use I don't think you need any relays.  I've been running =
Hella
H4s in my S2 for a couple of months now and I'm using 90/100W bulbs.  No
problems at all and they are very bright.   I seriously doubt that they
would work this well with only 10 volts.  My son has the same lights and
bulbs in his '89 turbo and they have been in there for 18 months without =
a
problem.  I've run 90/100s in my '84 Audi with European lights since new.
It still has the same bulbs.  So far I have never had a bulb burn out.

You want the "For Off Road & Racing Use" Hella European Technology =
lights.
Don't buy the DOT legal kind as they are inferior.  $40 each is about
average price.  I bought my last set for 20% below that during the
Performance Products sale.
