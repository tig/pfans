While I'm somewhat familiar with the concept of heel and toe, I would like a
little more detailed information about how the technique is actually
performed. Could some of our esteemed auto-Xers and racers put together a
little "Hell and Toe for Dummies"?

Specifically, I would like to know exactly how you put your foot (like \,
like /, or like I). Also, at which point to you actually perform the shift.
Do you keep downshifting through the braking process or do you go to neutral
for a while and then just find the right gear when you need it?

A step by step explanation about what both of your hands, your feet, your
engine, and your gears are doing throughout a turn would be very helpful.

I'm thinking about doing some Auto-x, but I would like to practice just a
little before I get out there.

Thanks for any input you can provide,
