Hello Marv, Rob and P-fans

=09One thing to remember when dealing with airbags is that they are=0AEXP=
LOSIVES!!! The fuel that =93inflates=94 the airbag is essentially =93ESTE=
=92s=94=0Amodel solid rocket fuel! Smells just like it too durring a airb=
ag deployment!=0AActually the airbag gas is made up of:  Sodium Azide and=
 Potassium Nitrate. An=0Aair bag is anywhere from 55 Liters to 110 Liters=
 in size, and inflates in=0Amili-seconds! This is why you always store an=
 airbag unit facing up, you do=0Anot want to have that bag fly up if acci=
dentally deployed! 
=09Marv, you also forgot to mention to let the system to =93dis-charge!!!=
 ALWAYS,=0Awhen working on the airbag system or around it, disconnect the=
 batteries=0Aground, to let the system charge down. The airbag ECU will s=
tore battery power=0Afor up to 30 minutes after disconnecting the source =
power supply. This is to=0Aensure a airbag deployment in the event of a c=
rash and/or loosing the battery=0Apower. Some of the next-generation syst=
ems (=9195 & up Porsches) charge down in=0Aonly a matter of 1-2 minutes, =
but better safe than sorry! 
=09Also take extra care of static electricity! When loosening the airbag=
=0Aelectrical connectors make sure you have NO static electricity on your=
 body.=0AJust touch the chassis before disconnecting each electrical harn=
ess. 


Good Luck
