Hi Pfans...

Time for yet another "If I didn't drive a Porsche, I'd be roadkill"
story.

It's been raining pretty heavily here in Santa Barbara recently, and
people here have no idea how to drive in the rain. 

I'm cruising down the 101 in the left lane on my way to class yesterday
morning. A guy in a rusty pickup truck with a chicken coop (whatever
those little house-camper things that go in the bed are called) in the
back is driving in the next lane over, a little in front of me.

All of a sudden, a SURFBOARD flies right off the roof of this idiot's
chicken coop (that's what I call 'em), on a path directly towards my
windshield. Boxed in by heavy traffic and doing 60, I go the only place
I can - left towards the concrete barrier, and smack the brakes. This is
in heavy rain, on a slick freeway full of potholes, with someone
tailgating behind me. I manage to get over far enough off the road and
slow down enough to just clip the flying surfboard, but not hit the
barrier. Thanks Porsche for good handling and brakes!

The only damage to my car apparently is a broken front right turn signal
lens and a scrape on the spoiler. I searched everywhere for a highway
patrolman, but I don't know where the donut shops are around here. This
is the second time I credit the 944 with saving my hide - it's worth all
the cash I dump into it.

As for the moron, I noticed his chicken coop was blowing all over the
place. I bet he lost it somewhere further down the road too. If you see
a rusty orange truck with Arizona plates and a moron driving it, ask him
to step out of the gene pool for me.

Alex.
'84 944, broken turn signal lens, scratched spoiler, alive driver.
