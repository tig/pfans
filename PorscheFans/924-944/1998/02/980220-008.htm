Tom,
    Back when we started our thread on timing belt replacements, I did a
lot of correspondence with Jim Pasha on this subject. Jim believes, and I
agree, that even with the spring loaded tensioners, the tension should
still be checked using the tool. I guess it's a question of just how
reliable the spring loaded tensioners are. If your mechanic already has the
tool, it only takes about one minute to verify the tension using the tool
once it has been reset using the spring loaded tensioner. Although, it is a
simple thing to do, it usually doesn't get done because it isn't addressed
in the shop manual. It sounds like your mechanic did what was required by
the shop manual. As far as the noise is concerned, if you could describe
the extent of what was done during the belt replacement it might help (i.e.
rollers, water pump, etc.). I think you may have already described it
before but, I can't remember. Perhaps your mechanic is right about the
noise being normal. However, if you didn't notice it before the retension
and do notice it now, I would be a little suspicious. Keep us updated.

Clark
