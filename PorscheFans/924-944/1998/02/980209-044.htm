<< Within the next six months, I want to buy a '86-'89 944 turbo.  I want to
gain as much knowledge of what to look for in these cars.  Does anyone have
any information on the following: 
 1) Average maintenance costs for 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989 944 turbo?<<

I try not to think about it.  Depends alot on how often you upgrade when you
replace.
 
 >>2) Top ten most expensive things to replace on a 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989 944
turbo?<<
1) Engine, 2)Transmission, 3)Full exhaust system, 4) Wheels (If you buy those
killer friction welded 993tt kind), 5) Clutch&Flywheel, 6) paintjob (basically
can't be replaced to original condition, but you can try w/ lots of $$$,

Couldn't finish. 
 
 >>3) Top ten least reliable parts on a 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989 944 turbo?<<
1) Driver, 2) Door Buzzer, ....no way I'm going to ten.
 
 >>4) General information on a certain year to stay away from?>>
I hate to say it, but If I had to do over again, I probably would have waited
on an '87 or later.  I would have liked an 88S or '89 Turbo (lots of cool
extra stuff), but insurance would have been a bit higher, as well as purchase
cost.  The reason I'ld not get an '86 is because of the front A-arm/spindle
arangement and 23mm offset wheels.
 
 >>>5) Any other (helpful) information/opinions on 944 Turbos would be greatly
appreciated!!
 Thanks in advance,
     Chris  >>

Buy one.  If you can afford it, go with an '89.  Bigger brakes, slightly
bigger turbo (which also translates to a bit more lag, but more power)  killer
struts.
