Congratulations!!! Good choice! I would wanted a Turbo S, S2 or 968, but the
pocket book was holding me back (new house, wife, etc). I instead found a
steal on an 88 944S with 60k on it. It has the 16-valve head and I am told a
somewhat similar timing belt/idler/counter balance shaft setup as later
models. My engine is super tight, and I get a whine exactly as you describe.
At idle, it is a lower, more dull sounding whine/rumble. When I wack the
throttle, it tachs up quick and the whine increases in pitch just the same.
When on the gas hard, the whine eventually turns to a throaty high pitched
rev.

The reason I am sharing this about my 944S, is that it didn't always make
that noise. When I purchased the car (2nd owner) it had 60k on the original
timing belt. I took it in to a VERY respected local Porsche Garage here in
Bellevue, WA (Squires Autowerk) and turns out the belt to so worn out, that
Squire was amazed that I didn't slip it and thrash the valves. I told him to
"make it like new". He put on all Porsche factory parts; new timing belt,
all new idlers, counter balance shaft bearings, counter balance shaft belt,
water pump (unrelated to timing, but oh well), and all respective seals.
When I picked up the car, the whine noise was there. He told me to drive the
car 1000 miles, and come back to have it all retensioned. I did exactly what
he said. Even after retensioning the belt, it still whined in this manner. I
then asked Squire about it and he said it is totally natural for a
944/951/968 engine to do this. It is a sign of a tight front end where
timing is concerned. I don't think you have anything to worry about.

(I think it sounds kind of cool.) Although I don't have a 968, I hope this
helped.
Again... Congratulations!!! Excellent choice!! Have fun and remember...
