This will only be of interest to people in the UK. I run motorcycle
track days as a hobby. And have been involved in car days in the past,
as I own a 924 and am a member of the PEC, I have had several
conversations with people about opening one of my days up to owners of
water cooled Porsches.=20
The day I'm proposing is May the 26th at Snetterton in Norfolk, this is
the day after a bank holiday, so you can join us in a hotel the night
before and totally destroy your driving ability for the next day.=20
I have based my figures on getting about 25 cars to the event so the
cost will be =A3100 per car, that is for 20 minutes in every hour. =
Please
note I normally run bike days so don't have any car instructors as of
yet but am working on it.
The event will be in the next PEC newsletter, and  (this bit is very
tentative at the moment) I'm hoping to get a friend to bring his 917
(the gulf one featured in the papers a while back). But it is in =
Belgium
doing a few shows at present, and we don't know if it will be back in
time.
