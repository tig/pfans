Clark,

USE FUEL INJECTION HOSE/LINE.  F.I. hose is good for 80 psi+
Carbureted hose is only good for 7-10 psi! 

Good Luck
David

 I also replaced the all the rubber hoses which connect directly to this
valve:  wastegate line, the boost line, and one other which connects up to
that metal mass of lines under the manifold.  The result is that the car now
makes full boost again--maybe better than it has in quite a while, which is
probably due to the old "timed" valve gradually failing.  As an aside, my
local dealership only had a part number for the valve-to-wastegate line,
saying they would have to sell me the other two already attached to that mass
of metal lines.  Ouch.  
	I ended up using some fuel lines intended for a carbureted car, but I worry
that they may not be able to take 15 psi of pressure.  Looking back, maybe I
should have just ordered an extra valve-to-wastegate hoses and used that.
