Lee,
    Wow 130 miles, that nearly doubles the total that you have put on it so 
far..

  I have never been in a 968, so I don't know how much help I will be. Some 
radios have holes in the corners that allow for removal. There are special 
tools to do this, but two bent pieces of wire clothes hangers works just as 
well. Basically, cut and bend two pieces of such wire in a u shape such that 
the wires will fit in the upper and lower holes on the left and right hand 
side of the radio. Then, gently pull on the radio, it should slide out. If 
your radio doesn't have such holes in the corners, I have no idea.. That said, 
does the 968 have a windshield antenna similar to the 944's? If so, perhaps 
your antenna booster isn't getting power? In the 944, the booster is located 
in the passenger footwell on the upper right hand side. The power lead is run 
along side the antenna wire that leads to the head unit. In our '86 944, the 
wire is black, and should be connected to your antenna out or accessory out of 
the head unit. I am sure you already know this though, you have been on this 
list at least as long as I..

  For the lighter socket, in the 944, you would need to remove the trim piece 
above the glove box. To gain access to the screws holding that trim piece in 
place, you need to remove the trim over the heater controls, counter clockwise 
rotate the little louvered cover over the interior temp sensor intake, etc.. 
However, I do not know how similar the 968 dash is.

Good Luck!

Ezra 

P.S. Your top 50 list was hilarious, even my wife thought it was funny!
