Hello P-fans
	All this talk about engine knock, I thought I would share two things I have
encountered in the 944. With all systems go and working you should not be able
to hear any ignition knock/ping.
	However, I have encountered two items which will make the 944 engine
ping/detonate. I discovered these tips, after tackling replacing my clutch.
Things that I forgot to tighten. I hate when that happens! 
	If the inductive pick-up sensor is loose (ie: if it can move side to side at
all) this will cause the ignition timing to change! Solution: clean and
tighten the 10 mm hold down nuts for the sensor. 
	If the inductive pick-up sensor - electrical connection part. If this
connector is not on all the way or has any corrosion inside of the pins, this
will also cause the ignition timing to change. On my car this connector was
not fully "pushed" or "clicked" together causing my engine to run very
strangely! The engine was surging, pinging, rough idle, I could not believe it
was just a loose connector! 

	Hope this helps fellow P-fan members out.

-David
