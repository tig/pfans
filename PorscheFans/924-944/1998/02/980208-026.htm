I change mine every year just because I inspect them yearly and figure if I
have them out, why not replace them.  
On a more serious note - I was talking to a mechanic, who told me that his
shop is getting cars with with plugs that have never been changed because
some manufacturers now recommend excessively long periods between tune-ups.
 These cars have frozen (welded) plugs to their heads.  Moral of the story
is to pull them every so often to prevent this. 
I personally have been using the triple electrode Bosch WR7DTC on the 16
valver (944S) because they were recommended by Jim Pasha a while back.
(instead of the silvers WR7DS that I still use on the turbo) They are
inexpensive and I have been happy with them.  
Anybody tried the four electrode Bosch?
