No need to feel foolish for asking questions. There's a lot to
learn about Porsches and driving. This is a great place to do it.

Heel and Toe. Used to properly match engine speed and rear wheel
speed when downshifing. The best place to learn about this (and
other techniques) would be to read the book "Secrets of Solo
Racing" by PFans member (911 list) Hank Watts. It's available at
Borders books and other places, and of course at amazon.com

Anyway, the proper sequence to perform a downshift (without 
braking)is:

1. step on clutch (with left foot)
2. change gear 
3. rev engine to correct rpm (with right foot)
4. take left foot off clutch.

For example, if you were cruising at 3000 rpm in 4th and wanted
to downshift to third, you would rev the engine to 4000 before
letting the clutch out (or some other speed, it's car dependant).
This way the engine and rear wheels are moving the same speed
before you let the clutch out, and there's not jerking when
you engage the new gear.

Now, that's all well and good if you aren't braking, but what
if you are. For example, you're approaching a corner that you
need to take in 2nd gear. You're currently in third gear. You 
need to slow down, downshift, and then drive through the corner.
You still need to step on the brake to slow down, the clutch
to disengage the engine, and the throttle to incease the engine
rev, but you only have two feet. 

The answer is to 'heel and toe'. You put the toe of your right
foot on the brake, and the heel of the same foot on the throttle.
You give a little 'blip' of the throttle with your heel, and then
you can let off the clutch with your left foot.

Depending on your car and your foot, you may need to adopt a
different technique. Personally, I use the ball of my foot on
the brake pedal, as that part of my foot has the most sensitivity
to braking force, and that's the most important. I use my heel
to blip the throttle.

Done properly, there is no decreasing in braking force, and
the gear and engine speed are perfectly matched.

Good plan!

OK. Assume you're on the autocross course. You're on the straight,
it's a high speed a/x, you reach redline in 2nd gear and shift up to
third. You stay in third, and approach a tight 2nd gear corner.
My technique is:

1. both hands on the wheel, I'm going straight, so my hands are at
   3 and 9. Left foot on the deadpedal, right foot on full throttle.
2. Into the braking zone. Hands stay where they are, left foot stays
   on dead pedal, right foot moves from throttle to brake, and I
   quickly but smoothly apply full brakes.
3. I'm slowing down, almost to the point where I start to turn
   in for the corner.
4. Step on clutch, move shift lever from 3rd to 2nd. Right foot is
   still on max braking.
5. Left foot has clutch to the floor, right foot rotates a little
   so I can reach throttle with my heel / side of foot.
6. Squeeze the throttle a little with my right heel.
7. left foot off clutch. Car is now in proper gear for corner.
8. Start turning into the corner. Right foot starts to come off
   the brakes (trail braking, but that's another subject)
9. Turn wheel into corner, right foot goes back onto the throttle.
10. Repeat as often as necessary.

Let me know if you have any more questions.
