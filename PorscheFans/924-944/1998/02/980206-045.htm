"Ron Helzer" <helzerr@atlantic.net> asked:
> 7.  How do I replace the bulb behind the clock (87 style dash)?

Here are some instructions - based on postings to the
list from a couple of months ago and my experience:

> 1. Open passenger side door and remove the triangular piece
> of trim that is on the side of the dash (one screw).
>
> 2. Remove the screw(s) for the passenger air vent - which are
> now exposed.  I removed all three which may have been too many.
> The "slider" for the vent control can be pushed through the vent
> which should eliminate the need to actually remove the whole vent.
>
> 3. There is a plate to the left of the passenger vent which, when
> pried off, reveals two screws (remove).
>
> 4. Now the secret known only to a few German engineers (and everyone

> circular climate control sensor cover counterclockwise (an eighth
> of a turn or so) and remove.  This reveals another screw (remove).
>
> 5. Remove all knobs for the climate control system (fan, temperature,
> and the two sliders).  *** The sliders come off easily, but the
> temperature knob and especially fan knob were very tight.  You have

> Be very careful when bending, removing and installing the plastic
> dash plates (especially this one;  I broke it when ripping it off.
> Well, nothing that glue won't fix...).  The plastic changes its

The description here isn't quite right.  There are actually two
bulbs - one which is pressed into the clock's circuit board, and
one for the cigarette lighter.  It is easy to accidently crack
the circuit board in the clock when removing the bulb.  If this
happens, the bulb won't make good contact with the circuit board.
The only recourse, short of buying a new clock (>$200), is to
place the cigarette lighter bulb (which is connected to wires)
into the hole in the clock.  This forgoes illumination for the
lighter unless you want to splice in another lamp.

The bulb is a standard Sylvania/Osram part available at about
any auto parts store.

Took me about two hours.  And I seem to have fixed the sensor fan
rubbing against the improperly positioned vent hose while I
was at it.  This was something which has bothered me occasionally
since the car was new.  I once tried to have the dealer fix it when
it was still under warrantee, but he did not get it right.  Now I
see that he did a bit of damage behind there while he was at it...
