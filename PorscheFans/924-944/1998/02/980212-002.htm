I bought an Evo 4/Technalon cover for my '89 951 from APA. It's a very high
quality cover (obviously the fabric is made by Kimberly-Clark, but
construction/sewing is excellent) which fits perfectly and has all of the
features you'd expect in a quality cover. I've owned several different car
covers, including Evo 3/4 from other manufacturers, and this one is the
nicest yet.

Service from APA was great, and their prices are excellent--especially
compared to Performance/Automotion (for example, the latter two charge
quite a bit extra for 928 covers, while APA charges only $7 more). I have
no affiliation with the company, but I am a satisfied customer.
