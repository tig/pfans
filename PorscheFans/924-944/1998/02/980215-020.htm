=0A=0AHello P-Fans=0A=09On the 951 there is a electric waterpump that hel=
ps cool the tubo and extend=0Aits life span. Every time you turn the engi=
ne off, the electric pump should=0Acycle for 30 secs. Also if the turbo w=
ater temp sensor sees more than 220=92F,=0Ait will keep the pump on until=
l the temp falls below this 220=92F threshold. It=0Ais normal for the pum=
p to come and off for a few minutes at a time, after a=0Ahard drive. Just=
 as the radiator fans cycle after a hot drive.=0A=09The turbo water temp =
sensor (new, about $30) is located to the LEFT of the=0Athrottle body, mo=
unted on a silver coolant supply pipe going right into the=0Aturbo=92s be=
aring housing. It has a single wire attached to the top of the=0Asensor. =
The sensor looks alot like a oil pressure warning sensor, 17mm hex/nut=0A=
body, but with a round pin sticking out of the top. If you pull off the w=
ire=0Aging to the temp sensor, and connect it to ground. The electric pum=
p =93should=0Astay on untill you remove the ground wire. If not the relay=
 is bad.=0A=09The electric waterpump relay is located in the fuse box, po=
sition G22, part=0A#951-618-149-00. I think a new relay is something like=
 $140. Ouch!=0A=0A=09BTW, all 951 owners should allow the turbo/engine to=
 idle for a few minutes=0A(esp, after a long trip!) after any spirited dr=
iving. Remember that =93screw=94=0Atwists up to 110,000 rpms when on max =
boost, it will take a while before it=0Astops spinning!  When returning t=
o my garage, I try NOT to spool the turbo up,=0AI also let the engine idl=
e a while, usually 3 to 7 minutes. =0A=0A=0AGood Luck=0ADavidjalai@aol.co=

waterpump always running=0A=0AHi All;=0A=0A=0ANow I have a problem with m=
y 1989 944 Turbo.  This morning the battery=0Awas dead when I tried to st=
art it up.  After getting it started and=0Areturning from a short drive, =
I noticed the Turbo waterpump continued to=0Arun longer than 30 seconds. =
 I stopped it by removing the fuse.  When I=0Areinstalled the fuse the pu=
mp did not start running again.  I think this=0Ais what caused the batter=
y to run down in the first place.=0A=0AAny ideas how to fix this?  The ca=
r had been sitting since last Sunday. =0AThe only stupid thing I have don=
e lately is clean the engine with a=0Apressure washer.  I tried to be car=
eful about where I sprayed, but I may=0Ahave gotten something wet that is=
 now shorting out causing the pump to=0Acontinue running.=0A=0APlease rep=
ly directly to wtmeyer@erols.com.  Thanks in advance.=0A=0ATracy Meyer=0A
