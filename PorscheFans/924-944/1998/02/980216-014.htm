In twenty years time when there are numerous NSXs filling up junk yards
around the world your children will kill each other over who gets that
Speedster. Much the same way you and your husband will over who drives
it if you buy it. Yeah NSXs are nice, so are Audis. But you can be
almost certain that you won't see another Speedster going the other way
every day.

Now, they're both good deals.  He really loves Audi's, so I _think_ he'd
be
pretty fair about sharing the cars equally.  But what if I got stuck
driving the sedan all the time??? And NSX's are great, wonderful cars,
but
they're not Porsches.  They're refined, subtle, responsive, but not WOW!
wind-in-your-hair knock-em-dead gorgeous cars like the Speedster.
