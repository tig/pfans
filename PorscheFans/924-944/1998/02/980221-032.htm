My 85/1 944NA has a tach that moves from zero to 200rpm when I start up the
engine, and stays there regardless of rpm. The oil pressure guage shows an
instant full pressure (50#, I think) as soon as the ignition switch comes
on, and before starting the engine.

I looked for info in the Haynes manual, but found nothing for either guage.
Your comments would be appreciated. For example: 

(1) how to troubleshoot each guage/system

(2) where to find the sending units

(3) how much trouble to replace various units

(4) if I find a defective unit, is it a repairable item, and if so where
should it be sent from Maui, HI

About the replacement of the clutch slave cylinder: 

I replaced mine successfully and have the following experiences to relate:

(1) This is definitely a job that can be done by the home mechanic

(2) While advice has been offered that it helps to jack up the rear of the
car higher than the front, I was unable to do that conveniently and the
bleeding was pretty easy anyway. I think the only difference is that the
clutch/brake master reservoir must be refilled more often during bleeding,
as it definitely tips more with the front only jacked up and therefore less
fluid can be bled off before it uncovers the fill hose on the side of the
reservoir. You would have to watch for that anyway, but be more frequent in
your observations this way.

(3) The main difficulty I had was with the bolts holding the starter motor
onto the bell housing. They were so hard to get off that I finally used the
jack to do it. I had a 14 inch long (+-) Snap-On box wrench (19mm, I think)
and even with my foot I couldn't budge it before it came off the bolt. I am
a 62 year old weight lifter, can bench press 130# 5 times or do 20 pushups,
probably not as strong as a 30 year old, but close. So I held the wrench
with my hand (absolutely necessary to keep it from coming off the bolt)
while jacking up the end of the wrench until it "popped." When it popped it
made quite a loud "crack" sound, and I could not budge it until I had done
that 3 times with the more stubborn of the two bolts. Each time it made that
sound.

I had difficulty making the video, as there was not enough space or light
under the car for best shooting, but after I edit it I'll send it along.
Frankly the Haynes manual is perfectly adequate for this job, and may be
more visible in the critical areas.

Thanks for all past responses.

and could be called gold or beige with flecks; any ideas on the correct name?)
