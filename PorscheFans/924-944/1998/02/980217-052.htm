Personally, I'd jsut get a friend to come along with me, give me a good 15
minute charge from his car, drive 5 miles, and recharge, etc. until you're
at a shop.  If one is reasonably close.  Just try to cut down on electrical
usage.  Ie, no headlights, no foglights, radio, a/c, vents, nothing.  Even
try to use the brakes minimally.  I don't know what the power consumption
is like in a 944, but I was always surprised how far I could get off a
battery that's only been charged a 5-10 minutes.  Just keep your buddy
nearby in case it drains faster than expected.

But then again, if you have towing insurance and there isn't any problem
towing your car, then that may jsut be less hassle for you.
