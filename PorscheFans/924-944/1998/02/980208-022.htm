Greetings,
My co-worker asked if I could post something for him. He has a 1983 944 =
he bought new. It now has 16,000 miles on it and of coarse, it's =
spotless. He purchased a brand new rear deck mat, but bought the wrong =
color. He would like to sell it and purchase a black one. It's light =
gray color with a "944" logo in red. Price is $85.00 US including =
shipping in continental U.S. only. Contact me at above e-mail address if =
interested. I'll send details of how to contact. Can't wait to snoop in =
his garage for other deals.
