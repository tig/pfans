You do not mention what weight of oil you have been using and what the PO
was using. It is possible, of course, that you do not know what was.
Either way...

Welcome to the wonderful world of synthetic oil.  One of their many great
properties is that they resist thinning out much better than conventional
oils.  I drove several cars before I found the car that I currently own
and I could always pick out which ones were using synthetic oil by
watching the pressure gauge in the end of the test drive.
