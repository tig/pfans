Thanks for the interesting responses on why the 968 Cab has no back seats.
The answer (it was too costly for Porsche to comply with the '92 requirement
of three-point rear seatbelts) makes perfect sense.

I have another question.  Occasionally the oil level warning light will stay
on after I have started my '90 '944S2 Cab (57K miles; 60K service done when I
bought the car at 55K last summer).  After the oil has had time to drain back
down, I check the oil (on level ground), and I'm right between the min and max
(a little closer to the max).  This has happened when the car is on a hill,
which I have assumed was the result of the oil collecting in one side of the
pan.  However, recently it has happened while the car was fairly level.  Each
time I check it, there is plenty of oil.  I start the car again and the light
goes out.  Any ideas as to what's going on here?
