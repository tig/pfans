I agree with whoever it was that recommended sticking with a new OE 
Porsche unit.  (And I agree that Mercedes reman'ed units are fine - 
been there, done that, twice in the last year.  Uh, two different 
cars.)

The economics of the waterpump market are weird.  When I did my 944's a 
few years ago, I bought a new OE unit through the wholesale aftermarket 
for $150, and Porsche bought back my core for $100 - they were 
apparently desperate for cores at that time.

BTW, I haven't heard Jay Pineau's name mentioned.  He used to, maybe 
still does, advertise in Panorama, and has an excellent reputation for 
remanufacturing water pumps.  Give him a try.
