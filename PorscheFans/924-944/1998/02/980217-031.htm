Hey......I have the earlier styled dash and when I bought the 944, it
had several cracks. I bought one of the plastic dash covers. Well, it's
now about a year that I have it installed and the Miami sun did warp it
a little but at least looks a bit more decent than before. It's not the
concours condition route that I wanted to go but if you're on tight
budget (especially when you're an enlisted active duty member of the
armed forces, then you know what I mean) then this ought to tide you
over until you've saved enough in that fabled "piggy bank" for a dash
board transplant. I'm still trying to save up enough to redo my torn
seat backs so that I can remove these seat covers that bunch up on my
back and under my backside. And the icing......I'm engaged, soon to set
a date and moving out. Uggghh! Still, I'm relentless and valiantly
die-hard to my 944. MGB's, old Jags and that Volvo PV544 just isn't the
same. You still have to tinker under the bonnet every now and then with
all of them, but the somehow the 944 is more fun.
