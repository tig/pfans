<shrug> I often double-clutch in the Porsche just because it seems to like
it, with all that inertia in the driveshaft. If I do, I tend *not* to
heel-toe and do the shift while coasting. In any case, for reference, the
traditional its-a-hewland-its-got-dogs-not-synchros way of doing it, which
addresses your issue, I believe:

Single-clutch heel/toe:

1. brake on, do most braking
2. clutch on (foot down)
3. change to neutral
4. blip throttle
5. change from neutral to lower gear - as soon as the revs have started
coming down from the blip.
6. clutch off (revs matched)
7. repeat process or (trail-)brake off.

Double-clutch heel/toe

1. brake-on, do most braking
2. clutch on (down)
3. change to neutral
4. clutch off (up)
5. blip throttle
6. clutch on (down)
7. change from neutral to lower gear
8. clutch off (up)
9. repeat process or (trail-)brake off.

Note to other folk: Yes, this is not the same as has been described by
others. No, they are not wrong. The whole point is to change gear without
upsetting the car - no "jerk" when letting out the clutch when
downshifting. It is a basic tenet of high-performance driving. How you do
it is irrelevant. Some people use the sides of their feet, others the ball
and heel, others make up gizmos, change pedal heights and god-knows-what.
The point is, your passenger should hear but NOT feel you downshift. In
order to do that, you either have to spend a long time in neutral (bad
because the car can't be controlled as well in neutral) or use the
throttle. IMHO, once you learn how to feel and do that, *then* worry about
doing it under braking, heel/toe, etc.

Two corollaries: 1. when approaching a corner, always get most of the
braking done first, then worry about shifting.
2. when approaching a dead stop or a red light, always downshifting is the
mark of someone unclear on the concept.
