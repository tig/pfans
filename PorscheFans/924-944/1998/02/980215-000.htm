Pop the door handle linkage clip (grey plastic piece) off of the
latching mechanism. Unscrew the clip by a few turns. Reattach it. It
will now push the latch bar down further.

Getting it off is a pain - I use 6 1/2" Channellock pliers, with one tip
on the metal pin from the latch mechanism, and the other jaw on the
clip. I then rotate. Hard to describe, and you run the risk of bending
things.

Putting it back on is simple - get a pair of needle-nose pliers, stick
them (closed) into the top of the clip, and push hard onto the pin.
