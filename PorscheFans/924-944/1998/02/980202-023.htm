I agree with your statement about the Excellence prices. I just got
incredibly lucky and bought a 1988 951S with 43500 miles for $8000 but just
replacing the mud and snow tires and doing the belts, seals and water pump
and motor mounts and the usual 30,000 mile service have me at $10,000 and I
haven't even addressed the indifferent paint job ($2000) and reanodizing the
wheels ($800), and I thought I stole it. Then I saw a mint 951S with low
miles had gone for $10000, I find it hard to believe.

On the bright side I just did my first driver's ed in the car and I'm still
grinning and will probably use this car for only track so the paint and
wheels may not have to be addressed. The car still looks pretty good if not
perfect.
