Randall,
I recently replaced the taillight seals on my '87 944. It is fairly easy to
accomplish but takes quite alot of time. 

1) Remove the rear carpeting.
2) Carefully pop out the carpet retainers for a few feet on each side of the
rear glass and pull back the carpeting.  
3) Unplug the tailight bulbs and remove them from the assembly.
4) Remove the (6) 8mm flare nuts that retain the tailights.
5) Carefully tap on the tailight assembly with a rubber mallet from inside
the car after covering the taillight assembly with a soft shop cloth.  This
will pop it out the back.
6) Heating up the old gasket material will make it more pliable.  I used a
hairdryer.  Take a plastic ruler and remove all of the old gasket material
from the back of the tailight.
7) Do the same to the car body being careful not to gouge the paint.  After
removing as much of the gasket as you can, soak a rag in WD40 and use this
to remove any remaining residue. This should leave the car surface looking
"good as new".
8) Wash the car around the tailights to remove the oil from the previous step.
9) Go to a car repair place and obtain a gasket for a windshield
installation.  This is what you use for the new gasket. It is black, gummy,
and comes in a continuous strand several feet long that is a square bead
about 1/2" on a side. 
10) Work a piece of gasket material around the tailight using a continuous
piece.  I think it's probably best to start the gasket at the bottom of the
taillight so that there is a continuous bead at the top.
11) Carefully re-install it trying not to touch the car body to early. When
the screws are tightened, the gasket will squish out and fill the void
between the car body and the tailight assembly.
12) After several washings my 944 no longer gets water in the tailights!
