I have some questions about the oil pump on the 944.

I took apart my oil pump from my '89 951 to remove the metal shavings that lay
within.  I was surprised to see that it is nothing more than two gears that
shove oil around like a swinging door.  Is this really all what move my oil
around the engine?

How does the crankshaft spin the oil pump?  There are no woodruff keys or
anything that looks like it locks the crankshaft to the oil pump sleeve.

So if the oil pump sits in the oil, and shoves it up to the oil filter, what
are the two tubes for that appear to rest in the oil?  One has a wire filter at
the end of it.  Both tubes are connected to the cradle.  If these are pickup
tubes how do they get oil up them? (when the oil pump is at the front of the
engine)

Thanks!
