Yeah Steve,
 Excellence DOES seem to favor the 911's but then, I
guess they know what side is buttered. Check out the
advertising ... for the most part, it's aimed at the
"air cooled". Also, I think most of their subscribers
are 911 owners.
I reall, REALLY wish I could find a 931 "in excellent
condition" for three grand. The cheapest 931 I've seen
was $5000., and it was NOT a 'find'.
I have not even been able to find a trashed 924 
for under $3000., and THAT was looking in the S.F. Area
 last Oct. On the other hand, I HAVE been able to find
$3000. 911's, (something that Anderson in his "market
update" column didn't mention).
In these parts (Northern CA) the used car market has
changed. If a car is trashed, the car is trashed. 
It really doesn't matter whether the Porsche is
air-cooled or water-cooled.
The REAL rant I have to "market update" are the blanket 
statements ei."avoid 924 Turbos", or "avoid early cars".
I have seen some early 911's,944's, 924's that are to die for,
and my own experience with a 931 has been SEVEN
trouble free, blissful driving years. It SHOULD depend
on the car and the driver, NOT on Kelly Blue Book
on a great car choice.
Besides, how many of us buy our cars wholesale?
