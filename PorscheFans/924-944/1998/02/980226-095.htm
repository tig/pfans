Pete and other faithful  P-fans,
I had the same problem as you had with the cracked plastic cover. My old one
was brittle and cracking all over the place. This cover should be kept in good
condition because it does protect alot of things from the elements. I ordered
a replacement cover from my Porsche dealer and had no problem getting it. I'll
have to check my records if you want to know the part no. and price. The cover
is held down by double stick tape along the bottom edge closest to the
windshield. If you pull up the cover from the front, you will see where it is
attached. I had to trim the new part to fit around the drivers side wiper arm
base. Clean the old tape residue off, make sure the new cover is in proper
position and stick her on! I have to say that the new cover makes the engine
compartment look 100% better
