Normally, I'm pretty "middle of the road" when it comes to these debates,
mostly because cars are such a subjective topic, but I just want to clear
a few things up here.  I have test driven a C4, had it for a few hours,
wrote about it a while back, also recently had an 89 Carrera for 4 days
while my car was being fixed.

I was in a position to buy a C2, RS America or a C4 when I bought my
89 951.  It was obvious which one I chose, but anyways.

>I did compare the C4 to numerous 944's.  I owned and loved a 3.0 944 and my

"may even be faster"?  Try, "it IS faster".  My 951 and every chipped 951
in the world has more HP and Torque at the rear wheels than the C2 or C4
has at the flywheel!  On the track, the only 911 series cars that compare
are the turbos and the latest 993.  I'm expecting the 996 to be faster than
my chipped 951.

>I think most will agree that the 911 has better, more timeless, styling and

No argument there.

>certainly has the best sounding engine of any car, except maybe 12 cylinder

While the 911 sound is excellent, a 951 on full boost is Ferrari like in
pitch and 911 like in depth, hard to describe, just very 962 like.

>examples as compared to $30k+ for C4's, but the C4 is a better drivers car
>without question for me.  Remember, this all started when someone asked

I won't question you, but many people who have driven the C4's say the
same thing as you are saying about the 944, that the C2 is the real
driver's car and the C4 would be a second choice.  Perhaps you run mostly
in the rain on the track?

All of the above changes of course if you are talking about the 993
bodied C4 and C2, which are, in my opinion equal in performance to a chipped
951 and higher in terms of beauty.

I can't wait for Hansmen's reply :)
