I had my brakes serviced with new pads and rebuilding the calipers.  At the 
same time, the rotors were turned/resurfaced.  This was about 6000 miles 
ago and since then I am getting the vibration indicative of warped rotors.  
My advice is to replace the rotors and forget about resurfacing as that is 
only a short term solution. 

Since we are talking about rotors, can any one advise me of where the best 
place/price Icould get the rotors for.  In Canada, throufgh an Audi dealer, 
I am looking at $153Cdn plus $10 shipping.  
My pans are to get them from Performance products as I will be in L.A. 
during the week of April 10.

My search for a condensor for the AC  continues.  If you have one and are 
in the L.A. area, I can meet up with you and discuss purchasing it (it must 
be pressure tested however).
