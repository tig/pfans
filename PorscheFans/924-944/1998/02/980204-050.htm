Mike,

You raise some valid points.  For me, the big interest in the 6-speed
conversion is that the shorter gearing results (theoretically) in faster
acceleration AND improved throttle response, yet doesn't place any
additional strain on the car.  Also, unlike a ring & pinion only
conversion, the sixth gear keeps the car livable on the freeway.   I
already have Autothority stage II chips and hesitate to add anything
else to the engine that will shorten its life.  Although my engine is
very strong (1% leakdown), it does have 85k miles on it and the thought
of adding a bigger turbo, going crazy with boost, or something else
along those lines makes me a little nervous -- broken 951 motors cause
serious and unforeseen hardships to bank accounts.  

I guess the big question that you raise concerns the price to
performance ratio.  In other words, how much added performance (both
outright acceleration and drivability) do you gain for the dollar
investment required?  Your $2500-$3500 estimate on cost is the first I
have associated with this subject.  Has anyone else come across a price
for this conversion?  A few days ago someone posted info on a SW program
that, as I recall, allows you to change certain performance related
variables of a car and then it outputs an estimated change in the
vehicle's performance.  If that software allows you to change gear
ratios, it would be interesting to see how big an improvement is
predicted by switching from the 951's 5-speed to the 968's 6-speed.
