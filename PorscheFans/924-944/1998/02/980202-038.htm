I bought the aforementioned car. Chris is right for the most part.
Except it cost just under $25,000 and it does have the tool kit. My
experience is around the west coast the 968 series is more expensive
than on the east coast. I was recently in LA looking for a car and
found 3 forsale (all cabs) and nothing under $30,000. Because of the
price differences, many dealers in this area are shipping cars from
Florida. My car too was bought at an auction in Florida and shipped
here. I have been looking for a number of months and found that in the
Seattle area dealers are selling a car similar to mine for about 3,000
- 4,000 after fixing the minor items Chris mentioned.
