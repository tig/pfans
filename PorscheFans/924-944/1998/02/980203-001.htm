Hi there,=20

My name is Zdeslav Perkovic and I=27m Porsche 924 owner from Zagreb, =
Croatia, Europe. I=27ve been reading the massages for a while but this is =
my first post to the List.

As most of the Porsche 924 owners I=27m looking for the performance =
upgrades in order to gain few HP. Thanks to Thore Karlsen from Norway who =
was kind enough to send me his answer, I=27ve heard about the possibility =
of installing the throttle body from one of the old Audi=27s (Audi 5 E?) =
in order to receive more power? Is this a truth? Has anybody tried that on =
Porsche 924?=20

I saw the advertisement in AutoAtlanta for the Porsche 924 performance =
throttle body , but the price is too high for me (shipping charges are =
killing me). =20

Is there someone out there who could help me to buy a used one (Weber big =
bore if it is possible)?  I prefere the offers from Europe since US =
shipping charges are just too high for me.

My car is 1983 production year, Euromodel with  125 hp ( little bit higher =
since I=27ve  put the K&N filter, SplitFire spark plugs and REMUS =
performance exaust on it)=20

Does anyone knows for any other performance upgrades for 924=27s ?  I =
don=27t want to open my motor in order to do any of the upgrades tricks =
since I don=27t know how this is going to affect the durability of my =
motor.

Sorry for the poor English

Many thanks in advance=21=21=21
