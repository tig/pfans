there seems to some guys out there suffering from  "low wave ratios" from
femmes passing your p-car. well, when i first got my 944 i got waved/looked
at PLENTY!  however, since removing some of the PO's additions, the 'wave
ratio' has subsided somewhat.  if anyone is interested in adding these
items to YOUR 944 to attempt to increase the ratio, these parts are in my
garage:  I still have a huge, non-porsche spoiler that extended beyond the
rear trunk sides;  a set of 17" chrome Anteres wheels, with nitto tires
approx 2" high. (Yes, it was a low-rider 944, i estimate the wheels weigh
as much as the car), a large imitation carbon fibre shifter that doenst fit
the 944 linkage, complete with a jury-rig to jam it on the shifter.  Sadly,
the black-out covering on the side windows had to come off (darn that NJ
state inspection ;-) you will have to get your own).  I won't part with the
blue neon-like LCD in the front windsheild that blinks 5-segments in
various orders, it no longer works, but i may fix it yet!  So, all you need
is a lowered, chromed, big-spoilered, neon-blinking 944, and you too, can
be a magnet!

By the way, my SO v1.0 (for 22yrs) and Daughter v1.0 both think 911's are
"hideous" , look like "frogs" and in daughters words, are for "posers".
are they waterpumpers or what?

sorry if i offended anyone.  if your cab looks like this, we need to talk!
