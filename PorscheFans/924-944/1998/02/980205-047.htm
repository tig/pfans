Email filtering: 

   Rox suggests using (for example, Eudora) filters to selectively eliminate
email with unwanted information. (I admit to spending too much time reading
stuff that afterwards I wish I hadn't on the digest mode.)
   Rox, please tell us how to do that! I have Eudora, but the free kind with
no manual. I also want to know how to make a directory of email addresses,
too. And I think I have a manual I downloaded from the net on my hard drive,
if necessary to refer to it. But I have this question: does the selection of
topics use just the title for its keywords? Are the titles good enough? Look
at the title of this one (4 topics)--would it work?
   Another way to do this might be manually to read the topics at the
beginning of each digest. If the automatic way Rox is talking about is just
going to read the topic titles, that might be accomplished pretty well
manually, too. Then you have the full topic on your drive if you want it.
   Another step to consider is to suscribe only to the topic list on a daily
basis, and get the full text from the archived version if you want. I don't
know if that service is available or not, but let me know if it is. My wife
is beginning to complain that every time she gets email (if it's before I
do) she has to wait for all the P-fans digests to download.
   Any of these suggestions rely on pretty good topic keywords in titles, I
would think. If we are to do that, maybe we need a short list of keywords
that we can reliably use in titling our posts. Example: 924- or 944-,
Repair, Performance, Value, Parts, Turbo, Sale, Meets, Rox-fans, etc.
Include those keywords to help filtering.

Shop Manuals:

   I just bought a Haynes and I find it pretty good. I also found out that I
can buy it and read the cheaper $25 microfiche manual from
www.my-porsche.com at the library. There is no printer there, though. I may
find that I can use the camcorder to capture the output from the reader on
videotape, in case I want to view it in the shop or print part of it out
(tediously) from the tape image. 
   [Leonard Schmitt wanted to know if it can be scanned in to a PC. Sure,
Leonard, but to get the scan you have to have it on some medium you can
scan. Do you have access to a Microfiche reader with a printer or scanner?
If not, you could try it on the camcorder, but my guess is that this will be
tedious to print as you have to freeze-frame first on the PC with video
board and software, and experiment with how close you have to be with the
camcorder, and you might not get the whole page with one shot or the
resolution might be poor. But you could play it on a TV in the shop, sort of
like your own microfiche reader, if it works well enough. We should both ask
my-porsche.com if they would create and sell manuals on CD-ROM's in addition
to the microfiche. They could do this at lower cost than we could, I bet.
Just a thought. Having the request from more than one prospect would be more
likely to stimulate action. If they won't, there may be an opportunity for
us to do this within our group. If others want this, let them reply and if
lots reply, we can check out costs.]
   The first objection to the Haynes is that it says the 944 should have the
timing belt inspected every 7.5K miles or 7.5 months, but offers no
directions on doing the inspection or the adjustment. Just says that it
can't be done by the home mechanic due to the general non-availability of
the (tensioning) tool. That may be an expensive tool, but if you are faced
with the alternative cost of paying a dealer to do this almost twice a year,
you could soon afford to own the tool. That is if you need to own the tool.
More on that.

Belt tensioning tool, needed or not?:

   If the home mechanic can indeed tension the timing belt, I wonder if
those who do this without the tool would please elaborate on how they do it.
I should think that some kind of guage that is in general use could be made
to work. Are we talking about a measurement of force? As in "apply 10 pounds
of push to the belt with your thumb and it should not deflect more than 1/4
inch when measured between two rollers that are 6 inches apart?" I mean like
you would test the fan belt tension on a Detroit car?
   If it is really too risky to use another guage, would it make sense to
approach the local Porsche club to buy such a tool for their members' use or
rental?

Converting 944 to 944S:

   I saw a post recently offering a 944S engine for sale for $3K. Would that
be able to be placed in a 944? (Mine is early 1985). Or do you need to have
it go in a 944S type car due to sturdier transmissions, etc., in the 944S
model? 

Value of 944S:

   Aside from the pleasure that I might receive from having a 944S engine in
my 944, would it add a lot of value to the 944? How do I estimate the increase?
