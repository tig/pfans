Hello,

Just to give you an update on the event.  All is progressing nicely.
The trophies are being made, eveything is falling into place.

We currently have 20 drivers registered for the event.  I'm having 25
trophies made up.  If a few more people pre-register through email,
I'll bump that up to 30.  If you know of anyone that is going to register
at the event, please let me know ahead of time so I can add them to
the count.

We have some very high calibre drivers coming out including Bill Buetow
and Glen Hernandez;  I'm expecting the event to be very fun.

I'm currently looking for three volunteers (brothers, sisters, friend,
anything) to do the following tasks:
- Still photo camera person.  You will be supplied a Canon Sureshot Z135
  point and shoot camera with 10 rolls of Kodak Gold film.  Your job is
  to use all 10 rolls on DSM/944 entered cars.  The camera has a pretty
  good sports mode that requires minimal brain power.  Camera experience
  would be an asset.
- Moving video camera person.  Prefer someone who has a VHS-C camera
  that can fill up a few tapes full of our guys running.  All tape
  costs would be incurred by me.  My video camera is on the brink, so
  if you have one with a sport mode, all the more better.
- This person is very important.  I need someone to write down the run
  times for people in our event.  The main event is a practice so it's
  unlikely anyone will be taking times, but we need them for our trophies
  and for the after race magazine.

Lastly, I'd like to announce that we have picked up two sponsors for
the event, Weissach Performance and Buschur Racing.  Both are kicking
in enough money to cover the trophy costs.  If I can keep things frugal,
their sponsorship money should also hopefully cover the mailing of the
videotape and magazines.

Paul and I will likely head down to Kent on March 1st to get some
practice in before the "big day" on March 8th at Bremerton.

Farzaan.
