Howdy,

Can someone tell me what the latest part number for the control arms on
an 89 951(S) are?  I looked it up in the FAQ, but the dealer says the
part number has been superceded by a new one.  I'm concerned that the
bushings I'll be getting with the control arm are softer than those being
taken out and don't want to lose any of the "S" stuff.

Anyone know what exactly comes with the control arms from the factory?

The control arms the dealer has received are:
   944 341 928 31
   944 341 927 31

The DSM/944 Owner's Challenge looks like it's going to be a lot of fun.
We are only in our 2nd day of registration and already have seven people
signed up plus the four I'll be bringing down.  We've already got almost
half of what we expect in the 2nd day!  Some people that I know are coming
for sure haven't even signed up yet, so this looks like it's going to be
a great event.

Farzaan.
