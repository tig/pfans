Hi gang.

Have you heard the story about the couple that got married and decided to
start a family?  They wanted children in the worst way but for various
reasons, it was very difficult.  Finally, one day she noticed something
different.  She was pregnant.  The couple were so happy they could barely
contain themselves.  They told their families and friends.  They began
planning for the new one and were just as excited as could be.  During one
of the checkups they were offered a test.  The test would look for
abnormalities in the child.  The couple hemmed and hawed about it for quite
a while.  It would be a great comfort to find out what they hoped; ie that
the child would be fine.  They told themselves that even if it came back
negative, that would be good because they would know and be able to prepare.
They decided to have the test done.  Their heart skipped a beat when the
test came back positive for an abnormality.  The abnormality was major but
probably unnoticable.  What to do?  You can't get her unpregnant (I'm
catholic) and you love the child even though it has a problem.

I'm facing a similar dilemma.  http://www.carfax.com provides information
about the history of vehicles.  I purchased my 86 944 Turbo in July of 1997
and have put several thousand miles on.  I LOVE THIS CAR.  Someone put a
post up about Carfax.  Ever since then I've had the gnawing at the base of
my brain to check out my car.  I bought it from a local dealer who told me
that they were personal friends with the PO.  So I finally decided to give
Carfax my $12.50 and check the title history.

My heart skipped a beat when the report came back.  I'm not the second
owner.  It appears that I'm the fifth owner.  The report also details that
the second owner trashed the car and it was reported as totalled.  It was
salvaged and issued a salvage/rebuild title.  It made it's way through two
other owners before getting to me.  I love this car and have absolutely no
plans on getting rid of it anytime soon.  But now, I know it's been tainted.
CRAP!

I guess I'm like the parents of the story.  I'm not getting rid of the car.
I love it just as much, but now I... how can I phrase it?  My baby isn't
perfect.  I guess I've lost a little pride in it as now when I see other
951s I'll know that mine is rebuilt and theirs (probably) isn't.

Thanks for the bandwidth.  I know you folks will understand in a way that my
wife (who coincidentally is pregnant with our first child) wouldn't.
