There is not one 'correct' technique for heel toeing, it depends on the =
placement of the pedals in the car and the drivers foot size.=20
The two basic positions are the heel on the brake pedal and the toe on =
the gas pedal (the foot is askew with the toe pointing right). The other =
position is (somewhat obviously) the toe (really the ball of the foot) =
on the brake and the heel on the gas pedal.
Personally I use the first method. This is most likely because I learned =
my track/performance driving in a 66 Shelby - disk brakes with metallic =
pads and NO power assist. I had to be able to put a hell of a lot of =
pressure on the brake pedal, a lot more that I was able to with the ball =
of my foot when using the heel to do something else!
On some cars with really nicely positioned pedals with good tactile feel =
you can heel toe with just the right and left sides of the ball of the =
foot. This is how I usually drive my 944.
I think some of the 911 crowd find the second position easier because of =
the bottom hinged pedals....strange cars.

How to do this:
As you are braking for a corner (or whatever) you need to downshift to a =
lower gear while braking. You could just stuff the transmission into a =
lower gear and slip the clutch as you let it out. No fun whatsoever. not =
to great for the long term health of the clutch. What you really want to =
do is to 'match the revs'. Matching the rev means that the engine revs =
are being brought up to match the revs of the transmission. This is done =
by giving the gas pedal a quick shot while the clutch is depressed and =
letting the clutch out at the right time (when the RPMs of the engine =
and drive shaft match). It doesn't really need to be dead nuts on but =
the closer the better. The tricky part of heel toeing is that you have =
to give the gas pedal a quick shot while you are depressing the brake =
pedal. Requires good coordination!! By the way - it does seem quite near =
impossible the first time you try it, quite unnatural. Practice, =
practice, practice. It will become second nature after a while. (say 2 =
or 3 transmissions....just kidding)

The reason:
Now why would someone want to contort themselves this way??
Just because you can! These days with the great braking ability of our =
cars you don't HAVE to heel toe to drive fast. In the past the added =
engine braking was a good thing especially when racing. In fact there =
are some folks that argue against down shifting because it is easier to =
change brake pads that a clutch.
With that being said I really enjoy downshifting with a well executed =
heel toe.=20

The next 'fun' thing to do:
After you get really good at heel toeing you can try the next racer type =
maneuver. No clutch shifting. If you get REALLY good at matching revs =
(down and upshifting) you can shift without using the clutch. PRM =
matching needs to be dead on or some very nasty sounds will occur and =
your transmission will become a coffee grinder. But once again once =
learned this is another semi useless (for street driving) but cool =
thing. I heartily recommend trying this on someone else's car or, as we =
in the frozen north call them, a  your tree beater (winter rat). I do =
this to my pickup all winter but I still don't have the heart (balls) to =
do this to the 944 much.

Anyway...try heel toeing, its fun.
