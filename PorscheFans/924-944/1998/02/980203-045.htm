I have been talking to several high-end 951 tuner types and they all agree
that a MAF set-up is good in theory...The problem is that they consider the
one that is being sold today to be a piece of junk.  As a result, one tuner
I am talking to is developing a MAF unit that will be completed in the near
future that will intake cool air instead of hot, and should also be much
more drivable around town (where the current unit is supposedly difficult
around town.)  The kicker is that this tuner is hoping have re-sellers
(like us) sell the unit for UNDER $1K!  More power, better drivability AND
less expensive...what more can we ask for?!?

I will keep you all updated.  The chips (Jim Conforti/Larry Bershtien
chips) are in my car and being tested.  So far, the results look VERY good.
 We should be selling an entire line of Porsche chips in the next month or
so for $200-$250....Custom applications too!
