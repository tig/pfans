I'm curious to read more about the following snippet.  The digest version
sometimes misses posts which the single-message guys get.  Can someone
forward the entire contents of the email with the following text in it:

car.

I spent the entire weekend working on the car.  Re-aligned on Saturday,
steering feels much better, at least it's got some of the legendary feel
back again.  On Sunday, took apart the door and took pictures of the sloppy
work to show the shop.  I vacuumed out about 20 pieces of glass fragments,
re-attached the plastic thing that allows the door lock to work.  Took the
passenger seat out (those things are incredibly heavy!) and vacuumed under
it, tons of broken glass there too.  Re-assembled the door to my satisfaction
and re-sealed the plastic (something they also did not do).

Thanks to nice members on this list, I was able to get rid of 90% of the hood
scratches and re-waxed the whole car.  I always made fun of the concours
guys, but I have to give a special thanks to them for helping me with that
one, these guys really know their stuff.

Anyways, the car is slowly getting back to normal.  Still not 100% happy
with the alignment, I'll wait for the dealer to offer another one with
me there :)
