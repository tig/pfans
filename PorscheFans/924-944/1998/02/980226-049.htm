Hi George, in fact there were two cars I saw that had this problem - 
rear axle nut backed off.  Another friend had the same occur to his 
race 911 at Bridgehampton a few weeks later, alas not before really 
trashing the wheel bearing.

The Factory says that this nut (900.910.093.02) is a one-time use part. 
 I believe that people run into problems when they ignore this advice. 
 I am pretty sure that in the other two cases (both 911's), the nut had 
been properly tightened, nominally. You can probably get away with 
re-using it one maybe two extra times.  It isn't worth the risk to me, 
personally.

David, the hub design and torque numbers aren't a turbo vs. NA thing. 
 It's a matter of steel vs. aluminum rear arms.

Kevin
