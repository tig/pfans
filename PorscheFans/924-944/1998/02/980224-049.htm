If you want to see more 951 related dyno info, the original dyno day
stuff is still up at http://www.buschurracing.com/dyno

What was your torque peak?  Any pictures of the dyno graph on the web
anywhere?

>Quick question:  What conversion factor were you told to use to

I think 20% is a bit too high.  What I did to figure out the
drivetrain loss was to stick the factory chips in and base it on
those numbers.  This is what came about:

Max Power: 212hp @ 5750rpm
Max Torque: 231ft-lb @ 3700rpm

So, to convert to factory specs:
Max Power: 247hp / 212hp = 16.5% loss
Max Torque: 258ft-lb / 231ft-lb = 12.0% loss

I generally round it off to 15% loss.  Now, I'm not sure which method
should be used to calculate the numbers, whether to divide by 0.85 or
multiply by 1.15.  Whatever the case, for my purposes, they are both close
enough to just round it off in the middle.

If you divide by 0.85, then my HP and Torque are 305hp and 320ft-lb of
torque.  If you multiply by 1.15, then you get 300hp and 313ft-lb of torque.
The 1.15 factor seems more realistic, if not a tad high too.

In the end though, the numbers are mostly for comparison sake to see if
a mod made a difference or not.  Whenever asked, I tell people I have
270hp and 280ft-lb of torque, basically add 10hp and 10ft-lb to my rear
wheel numbers :)  People always wonder why their 300hp Mustang is staring
at my 270hp tail lights.

A word of warning, watch out for the new Corvette.  Paul ran against one
recently and they are fast cars, they were neck and neck with no one 
gaining ground.  The Corvette's only mod was an exhaust, that's it.  Perhaps
if they had gone to higher speeds, Paul might have passed it, but in the
first two gears, it was a tie.
