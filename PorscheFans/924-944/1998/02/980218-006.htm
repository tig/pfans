Klaus,

I'm happy with german texts, because i'm in germany. Ja ich lebe in 
Dortmund was nu halt in Deutschland ist :-)

If you can get anything about the 924S 150 HP engine (i.e. lists of 
parts) and the 944S with 188 HP  i would be really happy. 

Tell me where you are in germany and i would come to you to get these 
info's if it's too much for scanning. 

Thanks alot,

Daniel
