Howdy all=21

   Well, I managed to change the belts and pump with out too many=20

problems. I did notice a few thing after changing the belts:

1-The temp guage remains at a lower temp than before.

     I dont know if the previous belt had loosened up and wasn't

     catching the pump as well, or the new pump pushes

     more water(dont think so).

2-The Old timing belt must have really played havoc on the timing,

     I thought the car ran great before, wow=21  Before there was a bit

     of hesitation on accel. and flutter when the accelerator was released.=


     now, its right there=21=21  and no flutter upon release.

Having used the tension tool(expensive but worth every penny) I cant=20

imagine a built in tensioner being able to consistantly tension the belt

every time.  The difference between 2 and 4 on the guage is next to

nothing=21=20

  If there is anyone in the Northern Indiana area in need of borrowing=20

a belt tensioner let me know Ill ship if you promise to be carefull:-)

Laters,
