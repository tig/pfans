Couple of questions I hope someone can help with.

1	I am experiencing a strange noise from my 86 924S (RHD). When cornering
LEFT ONLY there is a strange grinding vibration noise which seems to come
from inside the steering wheel or just behind the dash panel. I am sure it
is not coming from the door. It only happens when moving fairly fast, a
long tight left hand bend taken over 40mph will produce the alarming noise.
The steering shaft has been replaced which has got rid of a knock from the
worn couplings and the PS rack has been replaced.   There is no up or down
or side to side play on the steering wheel. Any ideas would be welcome.

2	Has anyone tried scanning from Microfiche? Someone asked a similar
question but I never saw a reply. A full set of manuals are expensive but
the microfiche sets are much cheaper. Would a standard PC scanner pick up
the detail and produce a reasonable print?   It would enable me to send
someone a couple of pages as attachments to a message or print out sections
to take under the car.

Thanks
