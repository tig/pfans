I knew better but did a dumb mistake anyway.  I HATE it when that 
happens! I got carried away with using anti-seize lube and put some on 
the threads of the 8mm allen bolts that hold the clutch to the flywheel. 
 Then I torqued to the specified 24 ft lbs.  This proved to be a NO-NO.  
I quickly re-learned that torque specifications are only useful if the 
fastner is lubed with the correct stuff.  In this case I had changed from 
a dry installation as per the factory to a very slippery anti-sieze 
installation.  The torque required to properly stretch a dry bolt was 
enough to pull the slippery fastner almost in two!  I was very lucky to 
remove the fastner before it actually broke but it was so close to going 
that the shaft was in an hour-glass shape.  It only delayed me for a bit 
while I got all new fastners and cleaned my lube out of the flywheel 
treads.  Anti-seize is only for aluminum, not steel.  Even lightly oiling 
will throw off the torque specifications for a fastner.  The anodizing on 
the new bolts is the only lube needed when torquing.
