I earlier reported my purchase of a 1988 951S Limited Edition (Silver
Rose) last November.  The car had 1,200 miles and was kept in a curated
collection since original purchase before being traded in at a Porsche
dealer.  The car was in as-new condition (still is) and came with
elaborate after market stereo and security systems. My car probably can
be used as the benchmark for "flawless".  I paid $18,000 which included
a 30,0000 service, new belts and water pump and a 90 day warranty.  I
have put on 4,000 spirited weekend miles and the only problem was a
stuck boost gauge, repaired under warranty. I feel the asking price for
the '89 you are considering is fair, but nonetheless you should use my
purchase as comparable in negotiating a lower price if you can.

N.B.  I submitted details of my purchase to Excellence 3 months ago but
they have not mentioned it.

PS to the List:  Am I wrong in thinking the "S" designation was given to
1988 247 HP 951's exclusively and does not apply to 1989 Turbos?

John,

If you went by the Excellence article you'd have to run away, wouldn't
you!
And from some of the prices I've heard talked about lately on the list
here
for Turbo S's in other parts of the country it SOUNDS LIKE there's some
"deals" to be had.

Personally IMHO, I think the price is quite fair. Although I would look
particularly hard for "storage damage" given the exceedingly low mileage
for
a 9 year old car, 22K is hardly broken in and a "new" Turbo S for this
money
sounds fantastic to me. This of course assumes the mechanical condition
and
documentation is as flawless as the outward appearance. And I believe
you
already understand the importance of reviewing records as opposed to
taking
the PO's word for it.

My perspective is based on watching Pano and Autoweek ads for more than
2
years and on purchase experience. My current '88 Turbo S, Stone Grey
Metallic/Light Grey with about 67K, excellent service records (new
clutch,
belts, H2O pump and all the regular problem areas) and was quite clean
with
only the usual stone nicks on the front and needed new
carpeting--$17,500,
Chicago, 1997.  An '89 Turbo Cobalt Blue/linen with 83K, spotty service
records but equally clean $13,500, Columbus, 1996 (put about $3K service
costs 1st 4 mo.). An '89 Turbo, White/Linen and 37K, never saw snow,
flawless in every way $21,000, Atlanta, 1997.

Sure, there may be "deals" floating around out there and I'm sure we'll
continue to hear about them. So often, though, when you go to look at
them
you find someone else's perspective on "flawless" is obviously different
than your own.

And then there is the topic of priorities. Some people seek perfection
in
everything they do and own -- to them it MUST be flawless or they
wouldn't
be happy. Other people are less concerned with the details and just want
"to
own and S", or simply enjoy driving the car. If you just want to own an
"S",
I'm sure you can find a better deal. If this car is "perfect", I would
suggest snapping it up quickly.
