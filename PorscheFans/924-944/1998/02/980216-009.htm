Hey guys,

I've got to get a car inspected here in Maryland. I know there are
quite a few of you from this area and was wondering: Does anyone
know of a trustworthy certified Maryland inspection station? OK!
Stop laughing please! I've had a few go-arounds with some of these
places myself, and from what I've seen I wouldn't put much past
them. Places I've tried have lied on several occasions and said
things were broken that were fine. I took one car two different
shops and got two almost completely different lists of things to
fix. I would expect that some of these places wouldn't be above
drumming up a little business with a hammer or wire-cutters or
something. I would really like to avoid a situation like that if
possible.

I know they can't ALL be dishonest, so if anyone has any helpful
information, I'll buy you a beer (or a soda for you non-alcoholics
out there). I'm in the D.C. suburban area, but will drive quite a
distance if need be.

For those of you wondering what kind of car I bought, the answer
is none. My girlfriend was given a Chrysler 5th Avenue by her dad.
To those of you who have met her, the mental picture of her 4'10"
frame in such a big car must be hilarious. Trust me, it's even
more funny in reality. I can't stop laughing!

Thanks!
