 a split second so I dismissed it as water in the intake for a=0Asecond (=
since I live in LA  and everythings been flooded lateley). It=0Ahappened =
again the next day, but hasn't happened since. In addition, I have=0Abeen=

last night, I went=0Ato the store, and when I came out, the car wouldn't =
