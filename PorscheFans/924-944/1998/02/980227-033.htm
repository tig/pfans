Along the same line of air filters and air boxes.....  Judging from the
design of the air box containing the air filter for my 83 944na, it
seems to me that Porsche designed the intake tube to tap cooler air
source from outside the engine bay compartment so as not to ingest hot
air from the surrounded heated air from the engine compartment. This is
the same reason why an intercooler was utilized on some turbo-charged
951 engines: hot air expands, therefore if the air was cooled, more air
can be crammed into the cylinders. My question is, is there a K&N air
filter, not necessarily a "cone shape", that would produce similar
results in a 944 or 951's engine power and torque? I realize that K&N's
would be nice because the feature to clean the filter w/ their special
chemicals and re-oil it. Oil, to me, would provide a more filtering
effect than a standard paper filter as since paper can have defects or
holes  to allow micro-fine particles to be ingested into the intake
manifold. Still, before going out and spending that extra few dead
presidents in my wallet, I'll wait to see what other comments are made
on this thread.

>> Since there appears to be many myths and a total lack of any real

>> stock engine, air box, headers and muffler.
>> 
>> I went to HMS Motorsport in Marblehead, MA to conduct the test
>> on their chassis dyno. A Dynojet 248C Chassis Dynamometer.
>> The measured results are translated to standard SAE to compensate
>> for absolute barometric pressure, vapor pressure and intake air
>> temperature.
>> 
>> Three test were performed, each test had 2-3 runs to ensure consistency.
>> The first test with NO AIR FILTER, the second with a STOCK PAPER 
>> FILTER NO COVER, and the third test with the STOCK FILTER & COVER. 
>> 
>> Without going into the exact numbers, (since I did have to pay for
>> for this information,) the results showed both the HP and TORQUE
>> with NO AIR FILTER performing the worst of the three test. On
>> average, it was down by 4 HP and 5 ft-lbs of torque. The differences
>> between the test with a COVER and NO COVER showed minimal
>> differences.
>> 
>> It was interesting to me that I lost HP and Torque with no air filter,
>> which indicates that maybe the chip would have to be changed to
>> compensate for the air/fuel mixture to get a real benefit. Possibly
>> changing the headers and muffler for less restriction might help
>> as well.
>> 
>> I wanted to try a K&N filter, but could not get one in time for the
>> test. However, one would have to ask that in light of these results,
>> how a K&N air filter could possibly get me 8 more HP? It couldn't
>> provide more air to the engine than no fitler.
>> 
>> I'll be changing my headers and muffler to a B&B. Now that I
>> have a base line with stock, we'll see how much it really gets me. 
>> The plan is to perform the same base lines and if there is a significant
>> 
>> change, I may try a K&N to see if it does anything.
>> 
>> But in the mean time, ff anyone is interested, I have a K&N Cone filter 
>> for a 911 which was used a short period of time, produces 8+HP. 
>> $50 plus shipping and it's yours! This is less than a $1 per HP!!
