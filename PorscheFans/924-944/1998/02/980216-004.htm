Hi there all!

Thanks for the enthusiastic responses to the Indy Meet-in-planning.
I already have calls in to the contacts at the Indy Motor Speedway, to look
into available dates
and possible track-time (Not real fast but its still cool).
If anyone else is interested in the meet please email me.

Also please forgive me if it takes a while for me to respond to my email as I
am wrapping
up the purchase of my new garage(Of course my fiance' favorite part is the
house that came
with the garage) She keeps trying to tell me that the garage is just a perk of
the house,
we all know different:-)

Safe driving!

Well, my fan temperature sensor really does work but it seems to turn on   
awful late.  Can these things be bought with a lower temperature setting?   
 I havn't owned this car long enough to get all the catalogues and   
magazines.  The other 'good' news is that I don't think my oil pan gasket   
is leaking.   The 'bad' news is that it looks like the oil is coming from   
the lower balance shaft housing (one of several leaks).  That at least   
looks more accessable then the oil pan...after I remove the front half of   
the engine compartment!  Oh well,  if I didn't enjoy working on cars then   
I wouldn't have bought it.
One last thing, I still have the question of whether the oil pan can be   
removed without lifting or removing the engine?  It looks like a very   
tight squeeze.
