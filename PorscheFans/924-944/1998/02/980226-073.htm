I'm in need of help from the collective wisdom.
During a very, very spirited drive climbing a mountain road near to
where I live, I noticed a sort of "tam-tam-tam-tam....". It is like
something under a resonance vibration. I even think that was a tire
problem, as a flat tire, but the car behavior was perfect. This is only
in plenty acceleration, and mainly when I'm in a curve. Some time ago,
at high speed (more than 180 Km/h), in full acceleration, straight
line, there was this kind of noise. The CV joints was regreased, and
this problem was solved, until now. 
What am I looking for? CV joints? Someone have experienced this problem
not being the CV joints? This problem only occurs in hard acceleration,
but never, until now, in 1st. gear. Tonight, it was mainly in 2nd.
gear.
One last think: after this spirited drive, I noticed the accelerator
harder (I think !!! It is difficult to describe). Is it possible that
this is caused by the motor mounts? And the noise, in this case?
TIA,
