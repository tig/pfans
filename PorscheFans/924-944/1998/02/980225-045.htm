Hello Porschefans,


I've been reading the threads on some of the aftermarket Porsche parts
companies.

Usually people give the average responses to the quality of service, parts,
promptness
of shipping parts, etc.

What I'm wondering is...Is anyone keeping track of these responses?  I for
one like to
know what companies are the best to deal with. That saves me from buying
parts from a company that I'm going to have trouble with after the sale.

Also, I wonder if the companies that have bad reputations know about it?
Porsche parts
are  a selective niche market. If they alienate the customers on this list,
they are losing
a comparatively large market share.

I guess most companies have their good points, as well as the negative
ones. (depends on who answers the phones  with some places).

With out if becoming a gripe-fest. I was wondering if there would be any
way to compile a
Faq on the subject. Maybe someone with a web page could host it? (Yeah, I'm
full of ideas but short on resources *L*)  At least list the phone numbers
of the water cooled suppliers, with a star rating. This would let the
perspective customer know what to expect if they order from that particular
company. 


Just an idea....
