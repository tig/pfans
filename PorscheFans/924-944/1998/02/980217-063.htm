Ok, stupid question.  You say exhaust leaks will reduce the turbo
boost.  Well what about hollowing out the cat converter.  I currently
live in a state where the emission laws dictate the emission control
must be on the car and "appear" to be functioning.  no sniffer tests
here.  So I was on my way to emptying it until I read this.  Will the
reduction in back pressure cause a problem?  If so, then how did they
deal with the euro turbo's?

Thanks,
Gary
