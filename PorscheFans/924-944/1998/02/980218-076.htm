this morning i went out and started my as normal, just to let her warm 
up before the ride to work.  about fifteen min. later i went outside and 
the car had cut off, and it has not started since.  checked the fuel, 
plugs also have fuel on them, i checked to see if the plugs were getting 
fire and there seems to be no spark. checked from the the coil and no 
spark, i had a brand new coil and put that on but no spark can be seen. 
can anyone help with a cule or two?  at this point i'm lost with what to 
do.
