I have been experiencing a similar problem with my "new" 968.  I found that
the leads coming out of the seatbelt receptacle were not attached anymore,
apparently having been "cut" possibly due to seat movement on the rails or
else the seat back.  When driving, I found that if I lifted my "butt" off
the seat cushion a little, the light would go out, which leads me to
believe that there is some type of pressure (probably a micro switch)
sensor under the seat.  I have to pull out the seats in order to install my
competition harnesses anyway, so I will fix it at that time(probably by
disconnecting it entirely).

So, I guess the moral of the story is...........If you want something fixed
right, GET UP OFF YOUR A*S AND DO IT (of course, this leads to a new
problem - if you thought people looked at you funny because an IDIOT light
was on, what will they think when you drive down the road with your pelvis
stuck high in the air?)

Hope this helps.
