>>I cant help thinking that until your motor is developing in excess of
375 hp with a corresponding amount of torque this is rather a pointless
question. An unsympathetic driver could destroy a  951 box with the
stock 217 hp. The people claiming this ( I recall seeing something on
Windward's web site ) <<

After reading too much about the supposed 375 hp limits of the 016 951
transaxle, I have to comment.

No flame against Windward, but how would they know what the limits of the 016
951 transaxle are? From my recent conversation with Jim McCarthy (owner of
Windward) and a discussion I had with his engine builder, they have never even
dyno'd one of these cars, let alone seen 375 hp or anything close. 

There IS a guy I know with over 400 hp/380+ lbs ft in a track 951. With the
exception of the obligatory 2nd gear stripping (1986 gearbox with over 15K
track miles) his car has not run into gearbox failures. 

This is a 2600+lb racecar that is not babied or given special treatment in any
way.  It even runs the stock 951 loop cooler.  Now C/V joints are another
matter..........

The "Experts" that spew this fictious or unsupported information really does a
disservice to the rest of the 944 population.
