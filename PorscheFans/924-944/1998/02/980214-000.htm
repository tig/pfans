Hi,

Just wanted you guys to share my pain.  My beloved car is in a mess.  The
local shop that did the work or oversaw the work has done a terrible
job with the repair.  The texture matching for the black pillar on the
door is totally wrong, one is dull, the factory unit somewhat shiny.  The
door still has broken glass in it moving around.  The first time I opened
the window, it jammed because glass was caught in the rails.  The door lock
does not work, even though it worked fine when taking the car in.

The alignment after the control arm change feels horrible, worse than my
rental Cherokee, and worse of all, my hood is all scratched up, so deep that
my Meguires #26 Yellow Wax won't remove them.  To be honest guys, I'm
heartbroken, this feels worse than when I walked up to a broken window
and a stolen stereo.

I would have rated my 951 as a perfect 10 before in a Buyer's eye.  If I
were to see my same car in a dealership right now, I would not buy it,
I rate it now at a 7 or an 8;  it looks like it's been abused.

Anyways, I wrote a nasty email to the shop, I won't mention their name
until they have a fair chance at replying, but it looks like I'm going to
try and bring her back to where she should be by myself.  I'll probably
have to get a professional (now that's a funny word!) to polish the scratches
out, but the rest I'm going to do myself.  

I just had to share my grief with someone :(
