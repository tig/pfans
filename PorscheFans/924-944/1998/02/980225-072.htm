Hello P-Fans

	Someone the other days asked how to de-code the model year in the Vin Number
plates. Here is how to. All cars built for the 1980 model year (M.Y.) and
latter use this system. Cars built before 1980 (for the US & Canada markets)
have a sticker on the drivers - inside door jam (or under the hood) stating
the M.Y. and production date. 
	The 10th digit (in the Vin Number) counting from left to right tells you the
model year of the car. The 10th digit will have a alpha-letter that will
corespond to the M.Y..  Letters that can be confused with numbers are skiped;
ie: "i","O", "Q". Starting with 1980 M.Y. is coded to the letter "A", 1981 is
equal to the letter "B" and so on....

	So say your looking at a car (a '86 951) with the following Vin number:

	WP0AA0952GN150012

	The tenth digit is a "G", this tells you that the car is a 1986 M.Y.

	Also the 4rth thru 6th digits tell you what country the car was made for.
	"AA0" stands for USA model. If it had a "ZZZ" it would be a euro model vin. 
	Note: the chassis vin stamped into the body by the battery underhood will
	always have a "ZZZ" look on the two other points: drivers A-pillar and
drivers 	door jam (or under the hood area) sticker.

	
Here is a short cheat sheet for Vin model years:

A='80
B='81
C='82
D='83
E='84
F='85
G='86
H='87
J='88
K='89
L='90
M='91
N='92
P='93
R='94
S='95
T='96
V='97
W='98


Good Luck
