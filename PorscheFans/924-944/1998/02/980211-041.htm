Dan,
    A Float? I thought it was an electrical sensor, not mechanical? Altho=
ugh =

my '86 944 is before the days of automatic oil level sensors, the PO repl=
aced =

the engine with one that has an oil pan with the sensor in place. When I =

replaced the oil pan gasket last winter, I got a good look at what I assu=
med =

was the oil level sensor. It was simply a metal rod in the oil pan with p=
art =

of the metal rod electrically insulated such that only the tip of the met=
al =

rod is exposed to oil. The exposed tip was at what I assumed was the min.=
 Oil =

level. The metal wire is electrically insulated from the oil pan where it=

leads through the oil pan. Since I am missing the rest of the system, I c=

only guess as to how it works. I believe the electronics for checking oil=

level must measure AC resistance (capacitance) between this probe tip and=
 the =

oil pan/block. When the capacitance reduces as the oil level falls below =

probe tip, a level comparator lights a bulb on the dash.. Perhaps there i=

some hysteresis in the electronics, or a time delay to reduce false error=
s as =

the oil splashes around, but a float with a mechanical lock?? Just my gue=

perhaps someone else can confirm this or let me know how the ckt operates=

This is not intended as a flame, just trying to understand how it works o=
r if =

perhaps what I thought was the oil level sensor is in fact for another =

purpose..
Thanks,
