>Porsche Technical Bulletin #83-03: "Phospahte-free coolant/antifreeze is
>installed in cooling system of all vehicles during production.  When
>replacing coolant/antifreeze solution, only a phosphate-free product must
be
>used, Part No. PNA 000 200.  Caution: Antifreeze other than specified by
>Porsche may cause corrosion of cooling system thus leading to engine
>overheating and damage."

>Possibly what the mechanic means is the use of a "Flush" such as Prestone
>"Super Flush" introduces phosphates into the cooling system which cannot be
>easily and completely removed afterward.  On a non-aluminium engine, the
>instructions would run (1) drain coolant, (2) add the flush with water, (3)
>run engine, (4) drain, (5) add water, (6) run engine, (7) drain, and (8)
add
>antifreeze/coolant.  The mechanic is right--normal flushing procedures
would

>Prestone "Super Flush does not say on the container that it contains
>phosphate.  I have been told, but do not know first-hand that most flushes
>including Preston contain phosphate because this is what cleans the rust
>deposits, grease, and oily residues; consequently, they should not be used
>with aluminium engines.  The rule of thumb is, "If it doesn't say it
doesn't

>Some shops have a machine which will clean the cooling system.  I have been

>for a shop because few customers will pay the labor and time charges for a
>"safe flush."

>For do-it-yourselfers flushing the system completely is a fairly long
>process but well worthwhile.  Hanes Techbook "Automotive Heating & Air
>Conditioning" has a 13-step procedure on pp 76-77.   Water is used as a
>flush and this method ensures the entire cooling and heating systems are
>cleaned out..  If anyone wants a copy, I'll be glad to send it.

>>While talking to a mechanic for a pre-purchase inspection, he mentioned
>>that it did not matter what coolant was used since it is not possible to
>>completely flush the old coolant.  It always keeps 5% of the old coolant
>>in there, enough to do all the damage that normal antifreeze can do.  That
>>seems a bit odd, since I gather most on this list advocate use of
>>phospate-free antifreeze.  I know this shop is 911-biased but the local PC
>>region recommends them.  Any comments?
