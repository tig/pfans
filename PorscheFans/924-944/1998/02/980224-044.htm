The interesting thread on welders begs for my two cents:

Craig Halseth is correct with his assessment on the "gasless" wire feed
welders and trying to weld sheet metal with an Oxy-Acetylene torch.

While I agree with Jim Richmond (thanks for the update on project fireball)
regarding a 110 MIG being too low power for welding thick (1/4"+) metal, the
normal fabrication that automobile repair/fabrication requires is easily
accomplished with a 110 volt welder.  My Italian made 130 amp Cebora MIG (also
know as Daytona MIG, Astro Mig and countless others) works excellent on
1/8-3/16" at it's highest setting, and will weld the normal .060-. 120 used in
rollbar and exhaust fabrication with astounding results.  I used to do that
type of fabrication with my stick welder.  I ended up spending too much time
grinding welds for cosmetic reasons, and filling holes that I had burnt
through with excessive heat and the excessive oxidation (read burn through)
inherent with the resistance flux welding method.  

The MIG process turns a good stick weldor into a pro, and allows a beginner to
produce acceptable results right out of the box. 

Case in point: while installing a window net on a 944, I had occasion to weld
a 5mm bolt to the inside door panel steel (.035).  My MIG welder did an
absolutely professional result with only localized paint damage that was
easily hidden by the fabric door panel. I have also welded gauge tabs on 944
dashboards with no damage. Try that with a Stick or an oxy torch!

BTW, Haynes has an excellent book on welding techniques. The good information
in this book almost makes up for the poor 944 manual.
