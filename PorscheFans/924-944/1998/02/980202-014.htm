Chris,
I don't have any info. on it but it sure was great to see it out there! As
far as I can tell he finished 68th out of 75 entries with 5 DNF's (in GT3).
I think he finished in front of (2) NA 911's in class.  Saturday night the
announcers incorrectly identified a silver 968 as the 944 (I noticed the
headlights) and then Sunday morning they did show the Red 944 after a
spinout. I noticed he had very tall wheels on it (17's I would guess).  Man
those turbo 911 GT1's make me think back to the 962 days.  I could close my
eyes and hear that turbo shift and swear I was at a Camel GTP event.  

I love Porsches......BTW, yes I did have to take my 944 out for a spin last
weekend!
