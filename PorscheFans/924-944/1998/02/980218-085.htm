The steering rack on my 85.5 944 has been leaking for the past couple of =
years (I only drive about 1500 - 2000 miles/year), and I think have only =
needed to add fluid once.  Car is currently stored for winter, but I =
have been planning to replace the rack this spring.  Local dealer quotes =
about $900 parts and labor including re-alignment, which would pay for a =
hell of a lot of Dexron.  This leads me to a couple of questions:

1. Are there suitable lower cost alternatives to buying/installing a =
Porsche remanned unit?  Note: I'm not inclined to do the work myself at =
this point.

2.  What risks, if any, do I run by not replacing the unit at all and =
just living with the leak, at least until it becomes more severe?

3.  Can these leaks be safely plugged by using a steering fluid "stop =
leak" additive?

Thanks in advance.  I appreciate any comments anyone might have.

Dick
