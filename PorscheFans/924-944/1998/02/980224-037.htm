What's all the Brouhaha? I don't get it. Except for the obvious error
about the Boxster being water-cooled, it looked like a reasonably fair
article about the product lines over time. It even had Bruce Anderson
claiming the 996 was a better car than the 993. It is unfortunate they
didn't mention the best water cooled PCar of the dinosaur age - the 944.
When it was announced it received rave reviews with the only
dissapointment being a 145 HP engine for the US. But it has to be seen
as a positive model for Porsche.

BTW, I wonder what Porsche is going to do about numbering these cars.
After the 999 are they going to be called 1000s???
