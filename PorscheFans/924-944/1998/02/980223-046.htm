I'm also very intested in what others have done.  Note that
the 944 uses a 4x6 'metric' opening.  It is a real dilemma
because there is a depth restriction - thanks to the steel beam
in the door which was carefully located in the exact rear of
of the speaker area...  Also one can not protrude too far because
a portion of the speaker grill is hidden by the dash when the
door is closed.

I have the B-A plates in my fronts.  Mine are the 'last years
model' 727 and require no drilling to fit.  I think the current
model is the 746?  As Matthew states, this years system requires
a bit of drilling of it's plastic mounting plate.  Otherwise they
are identical.

The B-A plates were better sounding than the low priced 4x6
coaxials I'd heard.  And certainly far better than the factory
Blaupunkts.

Good idea - where did you mount it?

For a rude suprise, I recently made some quick tests with
my Radio Shack sound meter and a stereo test CD (purchased at
Blockbuster or Warehouse Records, I don't remember which.)
The test CD has a variety of test tones, frequency sweeps, etc.
The results were both educational and horrific!

There was a lot of wheezing and buzzing - even with the rear
speakers turned off.  Some pretty wild frequency response
deviations.  Some nasty resonances to fix.  And I wasn't
even playing it loud - I was trying to keep things around
80-85 db!

Despite the seperate tweeter, the B-A speakers showed a
significant rolloff of treble above 5 khz.  This was very
suprising!  More measurements and analysis are needed.

Far worse were the stock rear speakers.  Where the B-A
speakers had some response below 80 hz, albeit a lot of
doubling (harmonic distortion), the Blaus had little.  At
20 hz, the Blaus were inaudible.  The B-As were at least
making a valiant effort.  Setting the level at about 85 db
at 100 hz resulting in over 100 db output at 1 khz.  Of
course in the upper treble there was very little output.

A *very* good sounding 4x6 is the ADS plates.  They are about
2x more expensive than the BA plates and sounded wonderful.
The ADS plates do require a small bit of metal trimming to fit.
In this price range the 4" MBQuart coaxials are also an
option and also sound great.  Unfortunately they were at
two different shops so I couldn't compare them side-by-side.
Both systems list for around $250/pr - though I've been
quoted street prices more like $200/pr.

Both ADS and MBQuart come with seperate higher quality crossover
networks.  The B-A plates, similar to most lower priced coaxials,
simply use a 2.2 uf electrolytic (!) capacitor to block bass from
the tweeter.

MBQuart, and others including Radio Shack's TechAmerica,
sell adapter plates to allow 4" speakers to be mounted in
the 4x6 openings.  So don't restrict your search to 4x6
only.  TechAmerica also has 3.5" adapters.

Right now my current desire is 4" MBQuarts at all four
positions.  But more listening, better measurements, and
repairs are certainly called for.
