Jeff,

You may want to reconsider a rebuild versus a new water pump.  I just bought a
brandy new one from Vertex for $189.  Vertex assured me that they get Factory
OEM pumps direct from the manufacture.

The pump should be here any day and I was treated very, very well.

You will need to order the update kit (center guard rail, nuts, and a roller)
as well as modify your rear plastic shroud for the update.
