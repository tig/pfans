I'm having my mechanic replace my timing belts and since the water pump
has 45M on it I thought I would get him to replace that also.  He also
said I should leave out the thermostat for the turbo, is this a good
idea?  Why did Porshe put it there if its not needed?

The water pump he is using for replacement is new and German built but
not OEM part.  He is charging $170.00 for the pump.  I've seen the pump
and it looks just like the original and I had much rather have that than
a rebuilt.  I'm not sure of the name of the company he gets it from but
I will try to find out.
