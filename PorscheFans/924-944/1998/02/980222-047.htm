My mech, Tony Price of Exclusively 9 here in Perth Western Australia has taken
all the cars he does OFF mobil 1 even the turbos. He recommends Pennzoil.
I recently changed the oil (and filter of course) and used Pennzoil also.
I have noticed the following since changing from mobil 1 on my 84 944
-The engine is noticeably quieter (esp at higher revs).
-The oil pressure fluctuates less than 1.5 bar from cold to hot,
whereas with mobil 1 oil pressure would be higher until the oil had done
a few km's (about 3000) and then drop right off about 1 bar at hot idle on
a hot (<35oC) day.
I can see that a fully synthetic oil would be of some use for turbo cars
and those who drive hard, but my car only does easy city driving, is never
raced and rarely goes over 4,500 rpm. My feeling (and that of Price) was
that while mobil 1 is good for those high RPM/turbo engines, the pennzoil
(which is turbo rated CD/SJ 15W50) was also a good choice for those daily
drivers.
especially here where the ambient air temp is often over 35oC (close to
95-100oF).
(you also save a few $$ when you do as many miles as my car does)
Just some food for thought for those with older engines.
