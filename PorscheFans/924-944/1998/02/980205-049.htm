In Eudora, you can select Tools, Filters to set up your filter information.
 Once your on the Filter screen its pretty self-explanatory, however if you
click on Help, Index, Filtering Messages, it will walk you through the setup.

>no manual. I also want to know how to make a directory of email addresses,
 
To do this, you can go to Tools, Address Book, New and it will prompt you
for a name such as Roxanne, and then you can type the e-mail address where
the cursor moves to.  Remember to save once you add an entry.

>And I think I have a manual I downloaded from the net on my hard drive, if
necessary to refer to it. 

This manual is very helpful in getting the various options set up for your
mail program.

>But I have this question: does the selection of topics use just the title
for its keywords? Are the titles good enough?

Most e-mail programs, such as Eudora, allow you to set you filter up to
look at any field in the header such as To, From, Subject and the body.
When we had the repeating "cheesehead" message, I set my filter up to look
at the Subject field for any that had "cheesehead" in it and sent it to the
trash mailbox.
