Plugs:   (Pertains to stock or slightly modified.)  After visiting the T/M website, the plugs appear to be similar (at least in concept) to the plugs used in my turbo-rotary engine (a.k.a. MAZDA).  Next time you're at the auto parts store (non-Porsche), ask to look at NGK plugs for an '87 Mazda 1.3L turbo.  Disclaimer-I don't proclaim to be an ignition system engineer!  However, I've fooled with various ignition systems, accessories & applications over the years (Accel, Mallory, MSD, Jacobs, HEI, dual point, indexing, grooved & split electrode designs, more/less gap, more voltage, etc.)  Generalizations:  I concur with comments suggesting that significant improvement may be impossible if the existing setup performs adequately.  If there are ignition +/or maintenance-related problems, correct them first before upgrading.  Also any 'noticeable' or 'seat-of-the-pants improvement' can originate from knowing that you've spent real money & real time to experiment.  For plugs for instance, it may help to have a trustworthy friend, etc. do the "install" for you - without telling you whether it was done or not!  I've seen things like idle quality change minute to minute without doing a single thing.  Be mindful of your testing methods (accurate gauges, analyzers, drag strip, etc.) & conduct more than just a couple of before-and-after tests/trials.  Also don't base mileage tests on just a few tankfuls!  My cars seem to do very well with the stock systems - I'd feel otherwise if I dealt with sky-high compression ratios or increased boost levels.  I'll be trying some of the cheaper plug alternatives soon & hope to post results (meaningful or otherwise) here.  BTW, I've always liked the MSD stuff although I'm not sure I would install on my 944.

Brakes:  I've been trying to research an upgrade & was wondering what was available for my '86 NA 944.  I believe these to be the most logical or prevalent:     1)  '86 944 Turbo     2)  '87+ 944 Turbo    3)  944S or late-model 944 Turbo     4)  ?????
Let me know if I'm way off base with this stuff.  I probably won't be considering an exotic (i.e. >$3000) upgrade since I paid only $3000 for the car this past November.  I know that I need new wheels too.  I'd really appreciate any response & I know many of you have got this information memorized.  The recent information re. the 968 rotors has been helpful as well.

Fuel related:  I've noticed the recent inquiries re. elusive gasoline-odor problems.  Mine just started a week ago.  I looked all over the place, starting with hoses & lines.  I also thought it was the fuel filler/cap. It turned out my #3 injector is seeping a tiny bit (mid-injector, not at the seal).  Without doubt, I'm intend to replace it.  Can anyone suggest whether all 4 should be replaced &/or should I look for a "matched set".

Thanks for reading the submission - Thanks in advance for a response.

Regards - RSB
'86 944 - White
'87 RX7 Turbo II - Maroon (trivia:  body, brakes & front suspension partially inspired by Porsche)
'94 Acura Integra - Purply-Grey/Grey-Purple?      [   non-VTec, NON-GERMAN  :-(      ]
