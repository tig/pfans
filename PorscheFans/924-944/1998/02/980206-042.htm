I thought I might share a discovery for all of us on the list.  Netscape has
released their new browser called Netscape Communicator.  "So what?" you say,
but there are a few things worth mentioning.

First, it's free!  Second, it is a giant leap into the next age of E-mail and
browsing.  For us PorscheFans it represents a new means of communication that
allows embedding of pictures, drawings, clip art, sketches, or formatted text
all in HTML format so we can now send clear ideas or pictures of our beloved
cars directly to each other without trying to make ASCII text pictures.  If
you have Communicator you will be able read embedded material directly. 
Remember all those Word documents I sent for my transaxle adapter?  Now you
will not need M.S. Word to read it.

Yes, there is a price to be paid, and it is more information must now pass
through our modems and I would not recommend sending HTML to the list, but for
person to person E-mails it has far reaching potential.

The Netscape E-mail also has a spell checker (something I can't leave home without).

You can down load Netscape Communicator for your PC or MAC at:

http://home.netscape.com/download/

Communicator also includes a WEB page editor to make your own HTML documents
and WEB pages, a Discussions Group that can allow live, multiple group round
table discussions, and a WEB browser, of course.

I am still experimenting with this new program, but so far it runs rings
around most anything I have seen.  Check it out, the standard version is free
for the down loading.
