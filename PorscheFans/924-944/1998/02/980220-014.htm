I checked out the lights on my UK 1986 924S.
1.	On UK (and I think all Europe) cars the turn lights are seperate amber
lights - not connected to brake or fog lights.
2.	My fog lamp switch only operates REAR fog lights BOTH SIDES.
3.	The additional front lights are wired as driving lights and come on on
high beam with the headlights. They can be flashed with the headlamps down.
4	There was an option which fitted both front driving lights in the bumper
and additional front fog lamps fixed below the bumper. In this case the
switch was replaced with a two position switch in the same location. The
first position operated the front fog lights and the second position both
rear and front lights. I am reading this from page 24 in the Owners Manual.
The wiring for the additional front fog lights is installed but the front
fog lights are very expensive and only the single position switch is fitted
in my car.
5	The rear Stop, Reversing, Turn and Fog bulbs are all 21W single filament
(it says in the bulb chart on page 59) I have not checked the car.

I can scan page 24 if anyone needs it. Email me and let my know the format
you want.
 
Hopes this adds to the confusion.
