pfolks,
I havent been able to keep up with the list lately but I want to say than=
ks to those who sent paint codes.

^on soapbox^
I have some unsolicited advice for anyone selling your car. The other day=
 someone wrote that they were looking at an S2. He listed the usual broke=
n or need replacing items. Mostly cosmetic. One thing missing was it had =
the S2 but not the 944 emblem on the rear. I think he was asking if the =
S2 HAS a 944 emblem.

Regardless, you see cars like this for sale all the time. Missing small =
parts that could easily be replaced. If you are selling your car it pays =
to replace these things before you show the car. I would go so far as to =
replace tired emblems and such even though they were not missing.

Your return on investment for these small parts could easily be 5-10 fold=
.. At least you will come closer to selling at your asking price. And at =
the very least you will sell the car faster. I've never sold a p-car but =
of the cars I have sold I have never sold one for less than the asking =
price (not counting a dealer trade I got screwed on). Its the little thin=
gs that count the most.

^off soapbox^
