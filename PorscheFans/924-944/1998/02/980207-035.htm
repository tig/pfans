Well, some of you may remember that I slid my car into a curb a couple of
weeks ago in the rain.  Low speed, less than 15mph but when the control arm
snapped I hopped up the curb and kissed a light pole.  It looks like all
the quotes are finally in and work starts on Monday.  $9000!!!!!  I'm not
really positive that all the work is mandatory but as the insurance company
is not complaining, I'm not going to worry about it.  They are spec'ing all
new Porsche parts with the exception of a rebuilt steering rack.  It breaks
down to $5k for mechanical and $4k for body work.  I will say that you have
to be firm about where you want your car repaired.  Both the original tow
service and my claim rep tried to get me to take the car to a generic body
shop to get ALL the body and mechanical work done.  Also, when the tow
service heard I had towing insurance, they offered to bill the insurance
instead of me, but the tow charge would change from $50 to $80 in the
process.  

Anyway, I'm not too concerned about the body shop.  It's a small father/son
outfit close to me.  I've seen their work, very nice and they have jigs
from manufacturer who makes the original Porsche jigs to check the tub.
It's also going to have the added benefit of getting rid of the stone chips
and small dings in the spoiler along with some keying damage done right on
top of the Porsche badge (bastards) suffered during PO's tenure.

What I am looking at is the mechanical.  I wanted to take it to someone I
knew and I had it taken to the local Porsche-only garage where I have had
work done in the past.  I actually tried a place recommended by someone on
the list (Porsche Performance) but they shied away from getting involved
with accident work.  Oh well.  So, now to the point of this rambling.  The
problems that I have had with this shop have not been related to work that
they have done but with parts associated with the repairs that failed soon
after.  i.e. new belts but balance shafts misaligned, ac recharge but
compressor seals blow, new master/slave clutch cylinders but
interconnecting hydraulic line fails.  Nothing really serious but enough
problems that I want to get the lists input about associated parts that
perhaps should be replaced at the same time.  For instance, they are
replacing front AND back wheels but no mention of the wheel bearings.  So,
what I'd like to do is list the parts that are going to be replaced and if
anyone has some suggestions about associated parts I'd love to hear about
it.  One thing that I am doing while the car is apart is having a new water
pump, thermostat and a/c compressor installed.  Guess this means that I
don't have to worry about my 2000 mi. new belt tensioning and balance shaft
problem anymore.

List:  frt and rear wheels, 2 air intake ducts, radiator,oil cooler,lower
engine shield, brake disc,control arm and bushings,steering rack and
boots,tie rod and power steering cooler.  Plus a/c compressor and water
pump/tstat.

Additional Question:  I supplied the water pump, thermostat, gaskets and
guide bracket/roller.  Shop is quoting me $400 which is almost 6 hours of
labor.  This seems awfully high even without any other work being done.
Can anybody tell me how much labor they have paid for this repair?
