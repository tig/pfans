>Hi Greg
I DO NOT agree with your statment: =93Gas torches for welding, do not bel=
ong
in
automotive body shops, period!=94. While I think I understand what your
statment
saying or implying about a fire hazard, but  I have quite a few line asem=
bly
videos showing BMW/Porsche/MB using a gas torch to flash or seal the weld
seams! Not for the main weld just to cover up the seam. Ture most modern
body
shops do not want a potential fire hazard but that is not how the car was
built! And any body shop idiot that would use it for a structure weld is
just
plain dumb. BUT - Germans (and others) have used and are using gas torche=
s
to
seal certain welded areas (area where the quarters pannels join, or fende=
rs
join to the body) in their body shops durring the asemblt process. Have e=
ver
seen how a E-36 (325i series or a 356) was made? <


What you are seeing is 'leading' This is not a welding method - it is the
use of lead, very similar to solder, being used as a body filler. This is
the way all "old time" pros use to fix damage and fill seams before bondo
came around. It is still the preferred method of repair - but just try an=
d
find a lead man, there are no more. I learned how to use lead on a 912 ba=
ck
in the early 80's and I won't go near bondo since. (The torches are used =
to
'loosen up ' the lead to the consistency of peanut butter)
Eastwood still sells body leading materials (Thank god). If you ever want=
 to
make really quality repairs or get into the restoration business this is =
a
must.

Chris White (don't use it enough to worry about lead poisoning!)
