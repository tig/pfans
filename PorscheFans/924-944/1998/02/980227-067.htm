Subject: 951 Crossed Drilled Rotors
PorscheFans,
I have the ability to cross drill the brake rotors on my car (87 951)
using CNC machining equipment at work.  Does anyone out there have any
information regarding the preferable size of the holes and their
location?  Once I know the size and locations, drilling the holes is
trivial.  Also, any tips as to where I might find this information
would be appreciated.
If anyone has put cross drilled rotors on a 951, have you experienced
any stress/heat cracking or other types of failures?  The car is a
daily driver, but will eventually find its way to the track.  Thanks
in advance.
Mike


Mike,
I have 968 M030 drilled rotors (these holes are actually cast into the rotor
rather than drilled) on my 951S and yes, they have developed stress cracks
on the fronts -- the rears have not. These rotors are about 18 months old,
have 30K street miles and 7 or 8 track days on them. The cracks are all
perpendicular to the hub and rather small. The conversion was done by Kelly
Moss Racing and there experience has shown the only time these cracks
develop into broken rotors is when they connect several holes and get to the
outside edge AND the rotor is worn beyond specs. My rotors are about 3/4 of
the way to minimums and will be replace before this season begins.

There has been a lot of discussion lately surrounding drilled rotors and
concern has been expressed by those with a lot more experience than I have.
One thing nearly everyone agrees on, though, is that drilling your own
rotors is usually a recipe for broken rotors.

Speaking from personal experience, there is NOTHING more terrifying or
dangerous than approaching a corner on the track at speed and having NO
BRAKES. When it comes to driving at the limit, the brakes are one of the
things you want to be able to rely on 100%.
