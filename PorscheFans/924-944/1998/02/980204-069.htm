>I'm no expert on these matters, but idea of the hot-wire sensor is seems
>straightforward. 

Superb explanation, nonetheless.   

A couple of other factiods regarding mass flow sensors.    First, for all
practical
purposes they simply replace the air flow meter in a LH-Jetronic, making them
functionally identical to an L-Jetronic.     Second, their lack of moving
parts makes
them more reliable than L-Jet air flow meters, and completely eliminates most of
the main failure modes.   Third, their only performance advantage over air flow
meters is in the speed and precision of their reaction to change, considerations
which can be somewhat overcome by DME programming, though not entirely.
This gives you the opportunity to generate marginally greater horsepower when
the induction system is in transition -- i.e., it reacts measurably quicker
to throttle
changes -- and since mixture can be controlled that much more precisely, 
emissions are proportionally lower.  

At steady throttle, however, there is virtually no difference.

As original equipment a mass flow sensor system has clear advantages over
an air flow meter system, though the fact that the advantages are clear does 
not necessarily make them big, and only in the above conditions.    Porsche
horsepower is always expensive, yet this device as an add-on would seem to
deliver very little bang for the buck.

I'll take two.
