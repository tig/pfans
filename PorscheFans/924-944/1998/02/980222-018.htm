When I purchased my 951 there was a small dent at the front of the hood, as if
someone's thumb had made a slight depression.  There was no paint fracture.
The dent was above the latch area and there was no access from the underside
of the hood.  

I called the local paintless dent removal technician with skepticism.  He
looked at the dent and said that he could remove it but that I couldn't watch.
He said that for $80 there was not enough money in the job to teach me how to
do it.  He called me from the garage in thirty minutes and the dent was gone.
I was impressed!

I looked for evidence of how he removed the dent after he left.  There was
foam between the inner and outer hood panels in the vicinity of the repair.
This could have been from the dent removal or from repair of the front of the
hood due to a minor accident that the PO had had.

that was several months ago and that spot is perfect, but a similar dent has
appeared near the first one.  This means that there is stress in the hood skin
and    would require filler and a hood repaint that I will not do now.

So . . . if your dent does not have a crease in it there is a possibility that
it can be repaired inexpensively.  Hope this helps.
