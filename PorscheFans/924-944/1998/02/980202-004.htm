Darren,

Given your priorities, take a good look at the 3.89 gear set. I have a road
test where they drove a Turbo S with that gearing and from my earlier posts
here's some of the info:

Darren:
As you can see, performance with the 3.89 is consistently at least
two-tenths better than the stock gear (0-60 was due to a shift at 56 mph to
3rd with the 3.89). And dropping three-tenths in the quarter seems
significant as well. In addition to this data, the Car & Driver June 1988
road test (if you have the Brooklands Gold Portfolio, p121) where they road
tested the car with the 3.89, Tony Assenza had this to say:
"Knappenberger's (Phoenix dealer) customer knows his final-drive ratios. On
the street and in traffic light shoot-outs, the Turbo S with the shorter
gearing had much better throttle response than the stock car. In day-to-day
driving, the factory car's extra top end is academic. Most people who don't
live in Turn Three at Daytona rarely need to travel at 160 mph."

You've read that I'm not willing to "cruise in 4th" (compare final drive
ratios 3.38 in 4th to 3.89 in 5th and they're pretty close). It's an easy
thing to try and clearly acceleration will be significantly better with the
bigger gear. The other important point this article bears out, though, is
there IS a 3.89 available for the Turbo. Windward also lists this ring and
pinion option in their catalog and Jeff Stone at Kelly-Moss confirmed it for
me. Haven't asked "how much" yet, but it is available.

How can I talk to your friend with all his parts assembled? I guess he's not
on the list but does he have e-mail or even a phone number? I have the exact
same information regarding which parts are needed, with one exception:  a
custom, machined adapter is necessary to mate the transmission to the torque
tube. I'm not sure what happens if you use the 968 torque tube and bell
housing but it sounds like the adapter is the easier and less expensive
route perhaps. Regarding the flywheel, that doesn't sound right to me. None
of the other's I've talked to mentioned this. And I've heard the 968 uses a
dual-mass flywheel that is unique to that model and that the clutch can be
changed without dropping the drivetrain, so the differences at the engine
end sound more significant.

Your idea about gearsets is another avenue I'm going to explore today. The
folks at PowerHaus II (oddly no interaction with PowerHaus) have a wide
selection of tranny gearsets available for the 951. Keep your eyes on the
list for more info on this front.
