This is in response to analogmike's(or is it air cooled mike) doubt about
Mass Air flow sensors.
To shed some light on the MAF kit benefits, I'll try to explain. There is a
difference between boost pressure and total flow. While turning up the
boost will increase power, it also causes problems such as heating up the
intake charge(this is what the intercooler tries to reduce), also, the
higher boost results in an increase in the effective compression ratio.
This can cause detonation problems, and more strain on internal engine
components. In an example, you could reduce the intake pipe to a pinhole,
quadruple the boost, and still get less power. Also, in a turbo engine, one
of the biggest drawbacks is boost lag. Any decrease in resistance will help
to reduce lag. 
    I would like a MAF not neccesarily for increased max power, but for
increased driveability. A flapper box cannot measure the true mass of
oxygen flowing past it. Differences in barometric pressure, humidity and
temperature all affect the true 02 mass. An aproximate value is assigned by
the factory and can be quite inaccurate. A MAF can measure the true mass of
air, thus allowing a more accurate fuel/air mixture, resulting in better
throttle response, fuel mileage, flatter torque curves, and an increase in
max power.]
   It's all in the stoichiometry!
