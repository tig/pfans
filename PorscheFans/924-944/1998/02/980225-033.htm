this is a reply of the 944 speaker delema:

i own a 944 and  I am a custom sterio installer and dealer, 
for my most resent recipe i have installed 2 12" ORION 2NT's in the hatch(yes i
can still get to the wells and the tire, i made this a necesity!), and an ORION
NT5s set(a 5.25" mid and tweet w/x-overs) in custom kick panals made of black
plexiglass and 5/8" partical board.  yes this does take up the entire hatch
area! but then again it is hitting 148.23db!!  i designed the system to be
extremly loud if needed and also with the ability to nock your socks off with
sound quality with normal listening music such as Dave Matthews Band. yes i
know 95% of everyone reading this is like "why would anyone do something like
that!" well i did it for personal reasons and just to keep up my skills!
  the thing you all would probably be interested in is the kick panals!
the panals are set on either side of the vehichle on top of the and side of the
side wells and the drivers side panal extends up into the dash for support and
looks and the pass. side panal is constructed so it fits around the well that
sticks up right below and a little in front of the the heater vent under the
dash.  the panals mount both the mid and tweet for best sound q. none of the
factory speakers are hooked up.  the panals are held to the body of the car by
one screw taped to the wall of the car(one disadvantage with the 83 i had to
relocate the hood release, but no need cause my alarm will pop it on command:>)
  i also have many other componenets but to much to write about (but if your
wondering just ask=) )

just an FYI:>
