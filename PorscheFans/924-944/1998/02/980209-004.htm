Notice I wrote 'looks like.'  Obviously a 951 running the 24 hour race
would be just a little different than the well prepared driver ed car.
Like you wrote, I'm sure the biggest changes were under the hood and in
the suspension. Still, I liked seeing a fairly stock appearing car
instead of one with wings on top of wings on top of wings. Some of the
911's crack me up. I guess the super large wings help, but to me,
seeing the wings up so high and wrapping almost all the way around the
rear of the car just looks silly. Then there are BMW's, yeah, they're
stock too. Until you look at the fender flairs, pretty silly looking.

That sounds like the 951 that Chris Brown recently sold. And he
raced in F stock!

Here on the east coast, we do see some heavy duty machines. At some
Bridgehampton DE's I've seen Art Pilla's IMSA GT 1 911, Michael
Schromm's monster 911 turbo (he hit about 190 at Pocono), Dick Howe's
924 GTR (yes, that LeMans running GTR, complete with 400+ HP 4 cyl
motor), and Nick Ventura's 'batmobile'. The batmobile started as a
914/6. Now it's a complete tube frame open cockpit car with a 962
motor. Now that I think about it, it's pretty similar to an IMSA WSC or
USRRC Can Am car. Nick did laps at Lime Rock down around 55 seconds.
That was quite a bit faster than the GT PSC cars ran during the
Memorial Day races.

One time at Bridgehampton, I was flagging at the Bridge flag station
when Art was driving the 911. He would come down the front straight at
full throttle, and just fly under the bridge before zooming down the
hill. The car was moving so much air that when he went under the
bridge, I would hear a WHUMP, and the bridge would actually move down
a few inches as the air got sucked out from under it. It took a few laps
before I was confident that he wasn't going to suck the bridge right
down the hill with him!
