Oil pumps are positive displacement devices, as opposed to centrifugal
type pumps.  Once they are primed, they just move the oil one slug at a
time up the pickup tube with each rotation of the gears.  Since the gears
are spinning fast oil flow can be quite large.  Pressure is built up
because of the tight tolerances in the engine and the fact that the pump
is trying to move a lot of oil into a tight space.  The pressure relief
valve keeps the pressure relatively constant by relieving, and
recirculating some of the oil back to the pan, much in the same way as a
fuel pressure regulator recirculates fuel back to the tank.
