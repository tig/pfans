Hello Fellow Porschefans,

First off I'd like to thank Jim Bergman for his hard work in keeping this
list going strong.

Secondly... this is beyond my level of organization, but it would be nice
to have a Porsche fans
car show/swap meet this summer. Someone that has ties with the PCA might
have the 
know how to get it going.  Or maybe one of the established car shows/meets
could  have
a booth where Porsche fans could meet in  person. 

I'm getting spring fever, as I was out in the garage today getting my car
ready for the warm weather. ( We were up to 40 F here in Michigan/USA). 

PS What ever became of the idea to have Porschefans T-shirts printed up.
Anyone ever
get the designs/prototypes made?


Thanks for the band width.....

Steve
