I would like to thank everyone who has been giving me great feedback these
past months as I have been looking for a worthy successor to my 1987 944S.
The list is long and distinguished.  Doug Donsbach, Nick, Barry Lenoble,
Mr WOT, Dan Webb, John Christensen, Tracy Meyer, George Beuselinck, Terry
Thomas, Tom Pultz and Badbob a toast to you!  Should you ever be in
St. Louis, let me know.
 
A few hours ago I took ownership of my "new" 1987 diamond-blue 944 Turbo
with 75000 miles.  It happens to have what seem to be 86 turbo wheels by
MOMO, upgraded suspension and an Autothority Stage II kit.  I think the
ride is tighter than the M474 cars I have driven in the past.  The
pre-purchase inspection did reveal some problems with the car but it is
nothing that serious. The engine is very strong, the body is great and it
has a full leather interior with no cracks which looks pretty nice.  I was
trying to stay away from another red 944 and spent a lot of time looking
for an S2.  Given the usable low-end torque of the car I bought I am happy
with my choice, plus I doubt I will be seeing another one like mine for a
while.

Enough rambling.  Happy trails everyone!
