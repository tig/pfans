I have a friend that used to work for Mercedes Benz that told me the same
thing. They would recommend adding a quart of automatic transmission fluid
to the oil and running the engine before an oil change just to clean
everything up. I personally have never tried it. Additionally, they
recommended adding  a quart of automatic transmission fluid to a full tank
of gas periodically to clean the fuel system and injectors. Has anyone else
ever heard of doing either of these?

Just curious,
Clark Fletcher


>Hi Donovan,
I have had stuck lifters on two of my previous cars - Audi Turbos - and in
both cases the shop mechanic took me aside and told me to take the car home
and to add about half a litre of automatic transmission fluid in with the
oil and to let the car idle (under no load) for 10-15 minutes.  The fluid
is apparently very good as a cleaning agent and will remove any sludge from
the engine.  In both cases my lifters were unstuck.  No more loud clacking
Noise! The mechanic was not allowed to suggest this at the dealer or he
would have lost his job.  They obviously were more inclined to replace
lifters as a good business tactic.  You must drain and change the oil and
filter before you use the car.  Remember you CANNOT drive the car with the
fluid in the crankcase.  <
