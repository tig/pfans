If memory serves, I seem to remember someone telling me about a 3M
system that matches paint.  They use a handheld device that is held to
the paints surface at several different locations.  The device reads the
actual color of the paint and allows a perfect match to be mixed from
the info from the device.  I wish the shop that repaired a fender on my
sun-faded Honda had used this system.  They tried three times to match
the paint, but still, only came "close."
