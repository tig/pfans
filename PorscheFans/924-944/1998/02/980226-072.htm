««I know nothing about the Super 4.  I was under the impression though
from
comments on this list that the tri-electrode Bosch plugs usually work
better (provide better output) than the normal (single electrode) plugs
partly because they do not require indexing,.  I wonder if the Super 4
is
the next evolutionary step.»»

Hi Menelaos,
I'm sure that I have a set of Bosch Super 4 in my car, that have 4
electrodes. It was some months ago, when the owner of the garage told
me the existence of a new kind of spark plugs, and everybody who have
experienced them was positively satisfied with the performance increase
in their cars. Of course, I put them in my car immediately (more
performance= :-))), but the results was not exactly the same as
reported before. They are fine, but it is not any miracle. These just
don't exist, IMHO. But, the price difference is not very high, so I'm
happy with this decision.
It is unbelievable that you, lucky guys in the States who have almost
always the best for your cars, don't have these Spark Plugs yet :-) 

««This is not by any means meant as a flame.»»

No flame at all.
If there is anyone interested, I can get more informations about this
and send. I imagine they have catalogs. FYI, it was not easy to find
them to my car, as the parts catalog was new, not reporting all the
cars (this is what the owners shop told me).
Anyway, maybe there is someone in the list who can put some light on
this, or some reference in the web.
