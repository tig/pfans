Apologies in advance...sent to me by a colleague (who doesn't have a Porsche)

>> Law of Relativity
>>
>>           A horse and a chicken are playing in a meadow.  The
>>           horse falls into a mud hole and is sinking. He calls to
>>           the chicken to go and get the farmer to help pull him out
>>           to safety.  The chicken runs to the farm but the farmer
>>           can't be found.  So he drives the farmer's Porsche
>>           back to the mud hole and ties some rope around the
>>           bumper. He then throws the other end of the rope to his
>>           friend, the horse, and drives the car forward saving him
>>           from sinking!
>>
>>           A few days later, the chicken and horse were playing in
>>           the meadow again and the chicken  fell into the mud
>>           hole.  The chicken yelled to the horse to go and get some
>>           help from the farmer.  The horse said, "I think I can
>>           stand over the hole!"  So he stretched over the width of
>>           the hole and said, "Grab for my 'thingy' and pull
>>           yourself up."  And the chicken did and pulled
>>           himself to safety.
>>
>>           The moral of the story:
>>
>>           If you are hung like a horse, you don't need a Porsche
>>           to pick up chicks
