I recently bought some Hella H4s from Jason at Paragon Products.  I =

several places and got prices ranging from $44 to $119 per light and=20
finally called Paragon.  Jason did not know the answer off the top of =

head but he said he would find out what the right part was and call =

 He did and I bought.  Ended up spending 45 per light with 55/60W bulb =

euro spec headlights.  Jason was very helpful and most of my purchases =

go to him in the future.
