PorscheFans,

I have the ability to cross drill the brake rotors on my car (87 951) 
using CNC machining equipment at work.  Does anyone out there have any 
information regarding the preferable size of the holes and their 
location?  Once I know the size and locations, drilling the holes is 
trivial.  Also, any tips as to where I might find this information 
would be appreciated.

If anyone has put cross drilled rotors on a 951, have you experienced 
any stress/heat cracking or other types of failures?  The car is a 
daily driver, but will eventually find its way to the track.  Thanks 
in advance.

Mike
87 951

Jim;
I've been working on my 86 951 trying to get the lower balance shaft   
housing off just so I can reseal it.  Mine is leaking.  The oil drops or   
is blown onto the exhaust pipe and it tends to stink.  The biggest   
problem with the Haynes manual is that they are working on an engine   
removed from the car.  Sure they have to for pictures but it isn't real   
world.  Access to everything is a bear.  I've gotten as far as jacking up   
the front end, removing the cooling fan (maybe the worst part, oil cooler   
hose in the way), draining the radiator and removing the hoses (for more   
work space), removing the front engine cover, removing the balance shaft   
belt and related pullys.  At this point, it seems I have to remove the   
camshaft belt and related pullys to get the rear cover off so I can   
remove the front bolts that hold the lower front housing on!  On top of   
that it looks like the right engine mount will get in the way of removing   
one of the bolts holding the rear housing on.  I am starting to think   
that I can live with a 'little' oil leak.  If someone else has performed   
this procedure then please tell me if there is an easier way.  The only   
good thing about this endeaver is that I have learned a lot more about my   
car. If I get done then I will have a much cleaner engine and everything   
I can reach will be well sealed!

BTW, everything works fine without the turbocharger thermostat.  Mine   
seems to have disintegrated sometime in the past, nothing left but parts.   
 I'll probably leave it out.  Why does the turbocharger need a themostat?
