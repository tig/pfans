Michael,

>which grade should I use?

Since you asked about Red Line I'll respond.  I recently switched to Red
Line in my S2 and I'm happy.  Shifting when cold at low temperatures
improved greatly.  Red Line makes various types of oils such as MTL
(manual transmission lubricant, 75W80) and MT-90 (75W90), which are GL 4
lubricants.  They also make two different gear oils, 75W90 and 75W90NS,
which are GL 5.

Porsche recommends a hypoid transmission oil SAE 75W90 to API Class GL 5,
or an SAE 80 to API Class GL 4.

If you have an LSD you have several possibilities.  You could use =
straight
75W90 or possibly a mix of 75W90NS (non slippery).  The NS has a bit more
friction to help with the syncros, but it can cause premature lockup
(clutch chatter) in LSDs.  However, it can also be used to enhance lockup
in older units.

One tactic if you have an LSD is to use all 75W90NS and then add a small
amount of Red Line Friction Modifier until LSD clutch chatter just goes
away.  This way you will have fine tuned the oil for the best shifting =
and
LSD action.

See www.redlineoil.com for detailed information.

BTW, Mobil 1 synthetic 75W90 is also a fine product which may be more
readily available.  I went with Red Line because I have MTL in my Honda
and know it works well.  I also wanted the good syncro action the NS
provided in my non-LSD trans.  YMMV.
