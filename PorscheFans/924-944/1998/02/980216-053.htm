Hey Everybody,

	I'm finally back on-line after being away for too long.  The Beast is
running great.  I finally got the starting problem figured out, it was
as I was originally advised, the speed sensor.  Once it was replaced
vroom at every turn of the key.  I also got the overheat problem solved
but I think I already told you that.

	I'm running in the snow just great.  I got Pirelli, Direzonal(sp?)
Winter 195-65-15's.  These are some terrific tires.  I lost some
handling of course going down from 225's but the overall dry road
performance of this tire is very impressive and in the snow I go and go
and go.  I haven't gotten stuck or even come close to being stuck all
winter and commuting 40 miles daily to Aspen puts them to the test.  I
would definately recommend them.

Thanks for letting me ramble, I sure missed you guys.
