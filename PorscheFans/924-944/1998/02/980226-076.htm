     Has anyone ever heard of "Royal Purple" synthetic oils?  I realize 
     there are thousands of these synthetics that all claim to be the best. 
      I am just curious, I haven't used it or anything.  A friend of mine 
     has a friend that has a shop that works only on Porsche (mostly 
     air-cooled) and he swears by the stuff in all the cars he works on 
     from stock to modified 930's.  
     
     Concerning all these reports about parts catalogs, I have an idea. 
     Each of these companies has an email address.  Why don't list members 
     email their post directly to the catalog company AND to the Pfans 
     list?  Assuming the catalogs check email, they should see that the 
     customer is not only complaining, but also letting his friends (a lot 
     of them) know about his experiences.  Seeing that an email was cc'd to 
     a Porsche list should wake up the catalogs.   Remember high 
     performance/Porsche parts is not the biggest market in the world, and 
     I for one would think the catalogs would take notice if they thought 
     1800 other people were going to find out how one person was treated.  
     There's no telling how much total we all spend on parts/upgrades each 
     year!  There's a lot of buying power represented here.  For example, 
     for all of you that have had bad experiences w/ Auto Atlanta, re post 
     the complaint along with the fact that you will pay higher prices or 
     whatever and deal with Automotion or Vertex, including the catalog's 
     email address and our address.  I used to live in Atlanta and so used 
     to go by Auto Atlanta a lot before I had a Porsche and the guys were 
     all nice, even the owner George.  I'm not excusing any of the bad 
     service anybody has gotten at all, but I find it hard to believe they 
     would ignore a complaint they thought was being mass distributed.  
     Same for the other catalog companies.
     
     Just my thoughts,
