or if somebody archived the posting, we have a need to talk.<<

I was not the one that originally posted the message. The tool your referring
to is made by Baum tools, costs over $300, and works excellent. 

Unless you have access to a machine shop and know a little about heat treating
metals, your prospects of making a similar tool that will hold up are slim. 

Concerning the factory manual debate, years ago I stepped up and bought the
manuals and made copies for use in the shop.  I recently bought the
disappointing 968 manuals, and have this to add; buy the manuals. The
pictures, wiring diagrams, and ease of use are worth the cost. 

Do I have a computer? Yes, two. Are they in my garage? No. Do I want to crud
my laptop up with car grime by taking it into my shop? No. CD's would be
great, however printing pages to take into the shop for each repair is
impractical and a waste of resources IMHO. 

Porsche manuals will only cost more to purchase in the future. They are a good
investment for the D.I.Y. mechanic wishing to correctly perform his own
repairs, and are readily sold for 1/2 to 2/3's of the purchase price when you
bail out of 944 ownership. I sold my 928 manuals for $50 bucks less than I
paid for them!  Look at it as a rental. 

I have gone through similar ruminations with buying the Mercedes Benz manuals
for my wife's car. So far I have fumbled my way through without them. The
924/944/968 is different enough from conventional automotive design that the
manuals are essential.

Owner of factory manuals from 924-968
