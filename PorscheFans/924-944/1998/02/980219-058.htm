Hi all,

I recently had the belts and rollers replaced on my 33K miles 1990 S2.
After replacement everything was nice and quiet and all seemed well.  At
1800 miles I had them retensioned... and now the engine makes some weird
noises, usually in a narrow rpm band between 1500-1800.

Today I stopped and talked to the mechanic that did the work.  I asked =
him
how they set the tension and he said they did it per the book... which
means for the cam belt, you just use the spring-loaded tensioning device.
=46or the balance shaft belt they used the special gauge.

Does this sound correct?  I seem to remember others saying that the
spring-loaded tensioner only puts an * approximate * tension on the belt
and that you still need to use the gauge to set it.  I saw the pages in
the factory manuals and they say to use the spring tensioner and that the
belt does NOT need to be done with the gauge.

My mechanic says that all S2s are noisy due to their wide cam belt and =
the
noises I am hearing are normal.  He suggested I give it some more time =
and
see if it quiets down.

Any comments from someone that actually knows the answer?
