Hi Tony & P-Fans

	A fuel pressure regulator is a devise that regulates the fuel pressure. The
fuel injection system is designed with a predertimined "rail pressure". The
regulator is located on the fuel rail, towards the back of the engine (on the
passengers side), above the "P" in Porsche on the cam cover. I am attaching
(but your e-mail bounce it back to me! send me a note with your new e-mail and
I will send it to you) a labeled picture to point out the various components
to you. 
	When the regulator fails, the fuel pressure can be very high causing a rich
running engine condition. Or the fuel regulator can fail and either leak fuel
or cause the fuel presuure to be too low. That would cause the engine mixture
to be too lean. 
	If the fuel regulator is original or leaking or your mechanic syas to replace
it - replace it! The regulator costs about $65 wholesale or about $85 retail.
Your mechanic should charge between 1/2 to 1 hour labor to install the fuel
regulator. 
	Also check the condition of the fuel line, it might be a good time to replace
them as well. Over time they harden and crack and can cause a fire! Take the
time and replace them now! 

Good Luck
David
