As Wes said, isn't your S2 pretty heavily modified in the suspension, and
lowered?  If so, that's the obvious difference.  I once wrote that my new
(back in December) S2 felt "more loosely connected" to the road compared
to my son's 951S.  That's still how it feels.  That said however, if I =
had
never driven a 951S or M030 car I probably wouldn't feel this way as the
normal suspension is pretty good too, especially compared to my Honda =
with
105K on the original shocks :-)

Just get the 968 and install the 968 M030 stuff!
