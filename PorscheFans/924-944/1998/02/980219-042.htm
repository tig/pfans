I hope I can shed some light on the subject:

1.	You are diving head first into a corner with other sharks all around
you.
2.	You delay until the last possible moment getting off the gas and
jumping on the brake
3.	Now comes the cute trick:
4.	While you are trying to keep the brakes from locking up (no abs) you
need to get the car ready to launch out of the corner.
5.	You downshift to the correct gear (clutch in - of course)
6.	Now you lean your right foot (the one on the brake) over to get the
motor up to the revs you think you will need to keep the rear wheels at max
traction to let your push through the corner.

Now remember step 1. (you have fins to left and fins to the right) if you
let your back end get lose you will have to lift, that puts you in back of
the sharks. Or if you get sideways you will pick up one of the sharks (read
that as HIT) this will also put you in the back (with a 13/13). Also take in
to account step 2. You don't have a lot of time to accomplish this simple
maneuver so it must be automatic.

So that's the facts of life in corners under race conditions, and why we
"heel and Toe".

BTW: I Toe and (Top of foot) it, because of foot size and petal placment

	While I'm somewhat familiar with the concept of heel and toe, I
would like a
	little more detailed information about how the technique is actually
	performed. Could some of our esteemed auto-Xers and racers put
together a
	little "Hell and Toe for Dummies"?

	Specifically, I would like to know exactly how you put your foot
(like \,
	like /, or like I). Also, at which point to you actually perform the
shift.
	Do you keep downshifting through the braking process or do you go to
neutral
	for a while and then just find the right gear when you need it?

	A step by step explanation about what both of your hands, your feet,
your
	engine, and your gears are doing throughout a turn would be very
helpful.

	I'm thinking about doing some Auto-x, but I would like to practice
just a
	little before I get out there.

	Thanks for any input you can provide,

	\ Henrik Frank
