The exterior driver's side door handle on my 85.5 doesn't work very well.
Takes a few little tricks with pulling the door inthe right direction while
fidgeting with the handle to get it open.  I have the door panel off right
now and was looking at the latching mechanism.  The door handle lever just
isn't forcing the bar attached to the latch down enough.  Maybe 2mm more
would get the latch to release as it should.  What's the easiest way to
adjust this?  

Funny, a flashlight would help me a lot.  I moved here 4 months ago and
still haven't figure out which box I packed it in.

Also, on the other door, the window seems to change speeds a few times
while it's going down.  Bad motor probably?  Both windows are dreadfully
slow as it is, at least comapred to my previous cars, is that normal?
