if you have ever driven a 911T then you know the NSX is dog meat!

the NSX is condemned because it cost over 80K dollars now has about 
the same HP as Ford Explorer and the roof sqeaks over any kind of a 
bump the tire is not that big a deal, the fact the every test shows 
the a 40K corvette blows its door off in every category except 
show...in addition the tire wear problem was not an intentional 
problem but rather something Honda (acura's are honda's you know and 
in europe the NSX wears a Honda badge) did to make the car handle at 
all...if you correct the toe problem for tire wear you will have a 
car that handles EXTREMELY poor...as for the NSX on the track the one 
at TWS this weekend could not even keep up with the Mustangs and 
Camaros
