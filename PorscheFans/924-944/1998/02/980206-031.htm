Hi Rox
	It sounds like the hose you decribed is for the carbon canister evap. There
are a couple of hoses along/by the rear of the frt drivers wheel. Actually
Porsche recommended removing/shorting the carbon canister vent line because it
had a habit of freezing. The Carbon canister is located under the drivers side
front inner fender. Pull the inner fender inner off and you will probably see
where it goes. BTW The fuel lines are all on the passenger side of the
vehicle.

Subject: Help!! Loose Hose

Hello everybody,

I need help, but thats the beside the point, I had to drive my baby in too
much snow this morning.  Now I have a hose that is where it shouldn't be.

Along the driver's side rocker panel, I now have a hose that is just
hanging there.  It was attached just under the panel with tie straps.  The
hose itself is about 1/4" to 1/2" inner diameter.  I tried tracing under
the car to see where it comes from but I reach a dead end just by the wheel
well.  It appears to go into the engine compartment from there.

Could this be a vacuum hose or is it something else?  I didn't notice the
car running rough though.

TIA,

Roxanne
