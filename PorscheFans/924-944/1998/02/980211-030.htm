Funny how my problems tend to show up on the list right when I'm having them
:-)

My oil level light has done the same thing a few times lately. My oil level
is also right in the middle of the range. It seems that if I start the car
and only go for a few hundred yards, turn the engine off and leave it off
for a few minutes (Gas station, cleaners, etc), and start it up again, the
light comes on and stays on! Turning the engine of and on does NOT make it
go away. Only after the car has been sitting for an extended period of time
does it not come on when the car is started again.

Thefirst time it happened it scared me really bad as I had to drive 20 miles
with the oil light on. I had checked and double checked the level, but a
little light like that can still make you nervous!

I'll be looking for other replies about a possible fix.
