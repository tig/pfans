My first reply didn't make it to the digest, so i give it another try...


Kevin,

Indexing the torsion bars sounds really complicated.
So i have some more questions:
1.what ride height difference range can be adjusted with the
  eccentric bolt on the trailing arm?
2.What's the effective height difference if the torsion bar
  is indexed one teeth more? (Or by how many degrees will the
  trailing arm be rotated?)
3.Do the bolts for camber and toe adjustment have a markable
  influence on the ride height? Shall we bring these also to
  a center position before adjusting the ride heihgt?

What about the fuel tank? I think a half full one would be the
best.

Thanks a lot for your help!
