Are the water droplets under the oil cap light green?  If you can't =
tell, or are not sure, read on.  Otherwise, don't worry.:)

Porsche and BMW have cylinder heads that need to be bled with a bleed =
screw when changing the coolant.  If it is not bled correctly, air will =
get trapped in the head.  When the engine heats up the air gets =
super-heated and makes a small crack in the head between the water =
jacked and the valves.  Since the crack is small and on the top of the =
head just below the valves, the water enters the valve cover as steam =
(most of the steam will get sucked around and go back into the throttle =
body) and the oil in the pan and on the dip stick will look clean.  =
Also, since the pressure in the water jacket is greater than the =
pressure in the valve cover, you won't see any oil in the coolant.  The =
only sure fire way to tell if you have this problem is to take the valve =
cover off and see if you have light brown goo on the inside of the =
cover.  I have seen this happen 3 times.  If you need to repair =
something like this, you might as well get a head job.:(
