        Lately I have seen a spot of oil on my garage floor so I 
decided to investigate.  Upon putting my car on the lift, at my high
school garage,  I found that my rear crank seal appears to be leaking,
it is located at the rear of the oil pan, yes or no, and that there is
oiling coming from an area by the oil pressure sending unit.  These 
leaks are both minor.  Should I bother fixing them?  My oil consumption
is about 1/2 quart every 1200 miles.  My shop teacher says that replacing
the rear crank seal is hard but fun.  TIA.

P.S.    About how much is the rear crank seal and is it a 1 or 2 piece seal?
