>What type of door lock system is it...
>                        3 wire positive grounded
>                        3 wire negative grounded    or
>                        5 wire pulse/switched.

Porsche uses a "3-wire negative" door locking system.  The best place to tap
into the wires is at the door lock control unit located under the driver's
side of the dash, just below the steering column.  Applying a ground signal
to the Brown/Blue-striped wire (pin #7) will lock the doors, and the
Brown/Green-striped (pin #9) will unlock the doors.  Note - the colors of
the stripes may vary from car to car, but the pin numbers are the same.  For
future reference,
many alarm manufacturers have wiring information available (but not always
on Porsches).  Their phone number can usually be found somewhere in the
owners/installation manual, or from wherever you purchased the alarm.

Most alarm dealers will not install an alarm purchased elsewhere.  The
reason for this is to limit their liability and potential misunderstandings
in the future.  For example - you buy an alarm form "Store A" and have
"Store B" install it.  Two weeks later, the alarm malfunctions (or your car
catches fire) and you take it back to "Store B" since they installed it.
They say the problem is with the equipment, and tell you to contact "Store
A", who tells you it's a faulty installation and "Store B" needs to take
care of it.  A lot of headaches for everyone -- you're without an alarm (or
a car), and both stores lose a customer.

The same holds true for just about any installable consumer item.  I once
broke the rear glass on my 951, and after finally finding a used one ($400,
the dealer wanted $1200 for a new one) I couldn't get any glass shops to
install it.  The last place I called said that they would do it for $200,
but would not guarantee it.  When I asked them what they meant, I was told
"If it breaks while we're installing it, we're not responsible."  So guess
what -- I did it myself!

Anyway...  good luck.  BTW, I've installed alarms and stereos in several
Porsches, if you have any other questions, you can call my office at
(918)582-9424, or email me.
