I just changed the oil for the first time on my 1991 944S2 last weekend =
and managed to dump oil down the side of the engine as I removed the oil =
filter.
Does anyone have any advise on how to change the oil filter without =
making a mess? 

I ask the same question every time I change the oil in my 1987 944S.  I have
never heard of any way to make the job easier or less messy except to place
some old rags around the bottom of the filter housing and let them soak up the
oil that would normally run down on the power steering pump and sway bar
bushings.  You will still have some mess to clean up but at least it will be a
"localized" mess.  It is important to clean all the oil from the sway bar
bushing and the steering racks rubber cover in order to keep them from being
deterioated (wish AOL had a spell check) by the oil.  I read somewhere that a
hole could be punctured in the top of the old filter before removal in order
to release the vacuum that holds the oil in the filter and then the oil would
run back to the pan.   Boy this sounds logical doesn't it?  DIDN'T WORK.
Guess we're just doomed to doing a good clean-up job after the oil is changed.
An occassional spray of engine degreaser in the oil filter area may be in
order from time to time.  If anyone on the list has some tricks of the trade
regarding a neat oil change please pass them along.
