P-Fans,

Took me a little longer than Lee to get back to my computer (my son WON the
hockey game 3-0 against the same team today) but Lee is too kind. Thanks for
the nice comments, Lee. I enjoyed meeting you as well.

First off, guys (and Roxanne), Lee has found one beautiful 968. He's
mentioned that it has 96 thousand miles on it, but there is NO WAY you would
ever know it. The car is tight and the body is perfect. And he found it
right in Chicago.

CHRIS ROMANSKI -- See. I'm tellin' ya, just be patient... or give Don Istook
a call and pickup the Turbo S if it isn't already gracing the garage of
another list member!!

And yes, we did leave Lee's 968 all in one piece... for now. However, now
that I know where to find it... (Lee, remember how your '74 Carrera, trailer
and all disappeared from your hotel in Cleveland.)

But, Lee, Lee, Lee.... about this "not go back to a Turbo S" stuff. Are you
trying to rile up that huge group of Turbo maniac P-Fans big time!! You're
supposed to say -- gee, it's not a Turbo S but it was all I could find, or
something. Unfortunately, once he gets it on the track he probably will be
so overwhelmed with TORQUE that he won't miss that Turbo kicking him in the
backside as he rockets down the hill into turn 5 at Road America... Tee hee.
Like hell he won't!!

Seriously, though Lee... it is a great car and I'm looking forward to having
you show me the right line around Road America this coming Memorial Day
weekend. Hey, maybe a good time for a little back-to-back comparison of your
968 and my Turbo S. She's all yours!

Thanks again for lunch. Great dogs in Chicago P-Fans.
