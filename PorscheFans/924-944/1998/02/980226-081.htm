    Despite living in South Orange County, there are only three places to
have Porsches serviced regularly (unless it's a Chevy or Ford pickup, I
consider a specialist a must). I can either go to the dealer in Newport
Beach, a small VW/Audi/Porsche shop in Dana Point, or a place in Mission
Viejo down the street from my house. I've been going to the place close to
him.

    When I first bought the car and had a 15,000 mile service done, the
mechanic noted a "small leak in right balance shaft housing." He told me not
to worry about it. That was last July. Last December he informed me that the
leak had "progressed" and that I needed to pay it some attention. He wanted
$550 to do it including cam belt replacement. I have never seen so much as a
drop of oil on the garage floor. When declining the repair my mechanic tried
to make me feel guilty claiming that "the seal could go at any time leaving
your engine without oil." Also, the PO had the cambelt done at the dealer
just 10,000mi prior so I thought it was wasteful.

    That was back in December and I have since put some more miles on the
car. It's due for another 3Kmi oil change. Still, not a drop on the garage
floor or anywhere I park. Also, I check my oil level religiously. Strangely
enough, I have not had to add any oil to my car and the level still resides
right at the "max" mark. I don't let one of those Jippy Lube places touch my
cars so I always take it to the mechanic. (It's only about $35 and I know a
real mechanic is doing it) But, that means I will probably have to deal with
the mechanic on the oil leak again despite the fact that there is no hard
evidence to support a leak of any kind. This mechanic is supposedly very
reputable but known for being "on the high side." Did he just want an Xmas
bonus from me? Also, I've been thinking of trying a new shop for the oil
change to see if I like them better. Anyone live around here with good
experiences?
