I live in Germany and own a 1991 944 S2. The car runs good and is in
excellent shape. I'm interested in using WR7DC spark plugs instead of
WR5DC (recommended by the manual). I called our local Porsche dealer and
asked him about the advantages and disadvantages of these plugs. It
seems that nobody in Germany worries about spark plugs. My dealer
recommended to use the WR7's for bumper to bumper traffic and "slow
speed" driving (up to 75mph) but not for high speed full throttle
Autobahn driving. He also said that the WR7 is a colder plug then the
WR5.
Is this statement true and can the WR7 cause any harm to my engine? I
know that from 1990 onwards all 944 S2 where delivered with WR7DC to the
US and that all (US and Europe) 968's were equipped with WR7DC's.
Thanks for any commends
