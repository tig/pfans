Hi  Pfans,

Thank You very much for Your answer to my question. I=27m in the process =
of searching for a throttle body that you have mentioned in your massage.

Right now I=27m looking for your answer or opinion about strange problem =
that I have with my 924 after installing the REMUS muffler on it.  What =
happened is that few days after I=27ve put the REMUS muffler on my car (a =
very wide header),I=27ve noticed that when I=27m driving very fast, say =
about 180 kmph and when I stop at the stop light the car is running on =
1300-1500 rpm and dont want to go back to 900-1000 as usual.=20

I=27ve turn the ignition off, waited for half an hour and turned the =
ignition on  once again. The car started without the problems but still =
running on 1400 rpm.  I=27ve opened the hood and using the screw driver, =
managed to slow the rpm  to 900 by adjusting the little screw on throttle =
body.=20

The car was running just fine, but the same think was repeating all over =
again when I started to drive at high speeds.=20

What is going on? Plese help me with your answer=21

Many thanks
