Over the years I've accumulated quite a few dings and chips plus the
right side of my car and front bumper have been repainted.  I was
sideswiped once and on another occassion someone pulled out too far into
intersection at a stopsign an backed into me.  At the time of the
paintings I was pretty naive and did not realize what a good paint job
looked like.  They did not use Glasurit paint and the colors do not
match exactly.  Anyway I would like to have my car repainted.

My question is:  How is a first class paint job accomplished.  I have an
89 944T with factory metallic black paint on most of the car and would
like to paint it the original color.  There are a few dings and
scratches that need to be fixed.  Should Glasurit paint be the only
choice?  I've seen recent posting about a paint called Sikkens but do
not know much about that one.  To get a good paint job do pieces need to
be removed(bumpers, doors, fenders etc.)?

Also I would like the seals replaced around the taillights(they are kind
of gummy and melted looking around certain areas.  Is this an easy
procedure which a good body shop could do and make look like new or is
it better to leave it like it is.  Any help is appreciated.  Thanks,

Randall Morton
