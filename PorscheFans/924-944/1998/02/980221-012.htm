I used Hawk Blues on my RX7 last year.  These worked great on the track and
I recommend them for that, but don't even think about using them on the
street - not even for a little bit.  I did and boy was that a mistake.
These pads produce a dust that is one of the nastiest substances I have ever
encountered.  Imagine normal brake dust to the power of ten.  Its like the
dust bonded itself to the surface of my stock wheels.  I'm still trying to
get it off.  And at street tempertures the volume of dust produced is
unbelievable.  You will literaly have to clean your wheels and around the
wheel wells every day.
