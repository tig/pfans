Well, I did it. I went to look at a 89 951 this weekend, and I decided to
buy it. I wont get it till wednesday, but I drove it for a while on Sat.
and got a good idea how it differs from my 88 non S. A lot tighter
suspension! It was wet so I didnt get a chance to really corner hard, but I
can tell its potential. IT really needs new tires, has the original
Goodyear NO's. By the way, if anyone wants some of that original German air
we were talking about a few weeks back, I think I can part with it. Buyer
pays shipping though!
I'm going to have both cars for a little while till I can sell my baby. I
actually felt guilty driving home in 88 after putting down the deposit,
like I had betrayed my loyal companion for a younger model. I think I'll
get over it though!. This means I have one too many 951's. 

So,  I have a Darth Vader black, gorgeous 88 951 for sale.
It has polished 928 flat rims(look really good on this car), paint is
great(some rock chips, turns heads when washed and waxed).I've had it for 2
1/2 years, bought it at 96,000 and now has 127,000. It's had a new clutch
about 8-10 thousand ago, the front seals just done,all belts just done,
rollers, motor mounts, water pump replaced at 97000, fuel line just
replaced, oil changed religiously, K&N, all filters,new brake pads f&r, new
rotors on fr.,  just passed smog with flying colors, Weltmeister
chip(engine pulls very strong, faster than the non chipped 89 I
drove)interior excellent, one small crack in dash, hardly noticeable, very
high quality window tint makes car look incredible(lifetime warranty, 2
years and no bubbles). 
    Since I really respect people on this list, I'll be totally upfront
about what it needs. Has slight seepage in one oil line in the back of
engine, mechanic says not to worry about it and wait till I do something
else in that area cause of labor involved(doesnt drip). Sunroof cable needs
replacing( I already bought part,needs install)mech. says 2 hours,motor
works fine) small gouge in right front rim, others great. 
Thats it, needs nothing else. This car is tighter than any other Porsche
I've driven, no sqeaks or rattles. Engine runs strong and smooth. I fix
things immediately with oem parts and a certified Porsche mechanic(my skill
ends with brake pads, oil and rotors). 
    I'm asking 11,500. Its well worth it. Im in Silicon Valley, buyer pays
shipping(ha, ha).
I would love to sell it to a list person so I could keep tabs on it. You
really develop an emotional attachment to these cars. I would keep it if I
could afford it, but I had to hock everything, including my cat, to buy the
89.

Write with any question.
