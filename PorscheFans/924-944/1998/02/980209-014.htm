The USA version of the 968 cab did not come with rear seats due to the USA 
requirement of 3 point harnesses for the rear seats.  However the 968 in 
Europe did indeed come with back seats and lap belts.  In the USA 968 cab 
the lap belt mounting points remain so it is possible to retrofit a pair of 
rear seats into a 968 cab by simply removing the parcel shelve and 
installing the seats.  I have a friend here is Minnesota that has done 
exactly this to enable the installation of the Porsche child(infant) seat 
in the rear of his 968 cab.

According to the Porsche Fact Books I have covering the '92-'95 model 968s,
the cabriolet was not available with back seats (even as an
option)......only the coupe came with 2+2 seating.  The Cab had only
storage compartments behind the seats.
