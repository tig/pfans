Guys, I have driven in everything from Simmons to Timberlands' and what it
comes down to is doing it so many times (Heel & Toe) that it has very little
effect which shoes you wear.

The only off the shelf thing you can buy that will reduce your lap-times
(and that's what counts) is seat time. Do every drivers Ed you can find,
find out if other clubs have track time available. The BMW & Mercedes cubs
never fill up their schedules. Just do it, and then do it again, then look
at buying cool things to help you drive easier.

	Regards,

Dan

	Christopher, you made some good points.  IMHO, good dancing shoes,
usually
	make good driving shoes especially when it comes to heel and toe. 
	Something made of nice soft leather or whatever, something with
relatively
	thin soles.  Enough traction to keep the shoe on the pedal, not
enough to
	keep you from sliding the foot when you want to.  And thick enough
to be
	better than driving barefoot but not too thick to interfere with
feeling
	the pedals.  Most sneakers can take the pounding of running and
jumping
	but stink as dancing shoes.

	As for use of heel and toe on the street, I use it lots on the
street. 
	Whenever I want to shift down really smoothly, especially in
slippery
	conditions, I have found heel and toe invaluable.
