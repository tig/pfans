I use the belt tensioning tool, however in the old Porschephile
list archives, there was talk of using a "90 degree twist" to set
the timing belt tension by hand.  This rule originated in the Chilton's 
manual for the 928.  One guy claimed that he put 40k
miles on his 928 after setting the tension this way.

I believe Porsche recommends using the same 9201 tool to set
the belt tension on 928s, but keep in mind that some 928s 
don't suffer engine damage if the belt breaks.

After I set the tension on my car using the tool, I gave
the belt a 90 degree twist and it was about right.  Keep 
in mind that the opposite might not hold -- if you set
the tension using the twist rule, you might get out-of-spec 
readings using the belt tension tool.

I have three articles on the subject that I can e-mail to
interested parties.  Two articles take a positive stance
towards the rule, and one takes a negative stance.
