P-Fans,

I can't remember who posed the question, but within the last week or so the
question came up -- "has anyone seen redline in top gear".

Well, last fall when crossing US20 in the high desert of Oregon on a
particularly long, flat section, a 1989 951S with APE Stage II chips (only
engine mod) did. Indicated speed was 181, calculated speed based on known %
of speedo error would have been about 172. This seems pretty consistent with
theoretical top speeds discussed these past few weeks with transmission
topics.

Man, was that ever fast!!!

And, no, we won't say who was driving....
