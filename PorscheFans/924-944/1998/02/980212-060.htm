Dave,

I have a tool which does the job.  It's the bearing race puller more 
typically used for transmission bearings, and is made up of a 
Stahlwille 11061-2 counter stay (AKA spindle), plus a Kukko 21/7 puller 
(45 - 58 mm).  Or apparently you can use a Kukko 22/2 spindle, says 
right here.  Available from Baum or AST.

This is small enough that it fits in the travel kit, for trackside use. 
 It's not ideal only in that the spindle feet mar the rather narrow lip 
on the alu. hub when pulling.  And I think I was out of pocket close to 
$300 for the puller and spindle, ouch.  (I've since bought other, 
smaller pullers, actually pretty useful for blind pulling some 
bearings.)  Anyway, beats going home on a flatbed.

I've seen other tools that are supposed to be good for rear wheel 
bearings, mostly targeted at Mercedes and Audi.  They seem aimed more 
toward install than removal, tho.

The travel kit also includes a plumber's propane torch.  You absolutely 
have to heat the hub quite a bit to make things work on removal.  On 
install, I've found that with a room-temp new bearing, it doesn't take 
too much heat to get zero interference on install.

Kevin
