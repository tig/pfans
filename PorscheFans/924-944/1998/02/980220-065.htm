Hi P-Fans
	When a fuel pressure regulator starts to fail, the internal diaphram will
either restrict fuel flow back to the fuel tank (causing a rich mixture) or
bleed off most of the fuel pressure at the fuel rail (a lean mixture). 
	When the F.reg fails in the rich sernario; your exhaust will be black and
have poor driveabilty, sometimes when this happens you can hear the fuel pump
"strain" under the load put on by the fuel reg not returning fuel flow back
the tank. Some poeple confuse this with a failing fuel pump when it actually
the fuel regulator that is bad! 
	When the fuel reg fails in the returning too much fuel to the tank, a lean
mixture will result. This can be felt by a surging (or a lean surge) in gear
at highway speeds. The engine will not opperate smoothly in gear. 
	Another impromto test would be to sniff around the fuel rail for any fuel
odors, it could be the early beginings of a leak or leaks at the rail. Look
for damptness at the fuel regulator and the damptner (at the foward part of
the rail).
 
	One another point of concern is the "imfomous" fuel hose recall. On all 944
turbos, the fuel line going from the fuel damptner and over to the rail (it
has a 90' degree fitting) is prone to leak and/or blow out! You can physically
look at this fuel hose, and see if it has a double compression crimp. If your
hose has only one crimp - your recall has not been done! Replace your hose
ASAP!
