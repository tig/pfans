Hey there P-Fans,

I have been reading this list almost daily for a year and a half now,
and I just want to say thanks to everyone for all the great
information.  I look forward to reading the Archives every morning
with my coffee, and I have learned a tremendous amount, and gotten a
lot of laughs as well.

I have an '83 944,  120K mi, manufactured August 1982, which I have
owned for about three years now.  I am the third owner of the car. 
The first owner apparently took excellent care of the car, but the
second did not, and consequently I have spent thousands on the normal
944 maladies we all know so well; clutch, oil cooler seals, head
gasket, valve guides and seals, water pump, all belts and rollers, as
well as a new radiator, starter, brake master cylinder, ignition
switch, thermostat, all hoses, etc., etc.  I have also done some
upgrades, including a K&N filter, Weltmeister swaybars front and rear,
adjustable Koni Reds all the way 'round, Sway-a-Way torsion bars (yet
to install), and 250lb Eibach springs.  I love the way this car feels
in the twisties, but like many NA owners I do suffer from the
occasional bout of Turbo envy.  Oh well, someday soon...

Now to the problem of the day.  My car has developed a most bothersome
and obnoxious "clacking" noise.  It appears to be coming from the
head, specifically the cylinder closest to the firewall.  My initial
diagnosis was a stuck lifter, which was confirmed by the 944 guy at
the local Porsche dealership (Beverly Hills Porsche-Audi).  They
quoted me $345 labor plus parts, with a lifter price of $71/each. 
Other than the infernal racket caused by the lifter the car runs
great.  I have noticed no change in power.  I also just had the car
smogged last week and it very easily passed with well-below
acceptable, even below average, emission levels.

I have the factory manuals, as well as the Haynes book, both of which
I consulted with regard to doing the lifter replacement myself.  It
looks like a job that I could probably do, but would really rather
not, especially since I would have to take the car in afterward to
have the cam belt tensioned properly anyway.  I have tried a product
made by Swepco, called "Oil Improver" on the recommendation of someone
at another independent Porsche shop, with no results.  Having read all
the various threads about "snake oil" additives on the list, I am
aware of the generally low regard in which these products are held,
but I am willing to try another additive before I bite the bullet and
attempt this job or fork out the cash to have it done by the shop.  I
run Castrol Syntec 5w50 synthetic oil in the car, and have since I
have owned it.  It was suggested to me, by the mechanic at the
dealership who confirmed my lifter diagnosis, that switching to
conventional oil might be a fix.  I am convinced of the superiority of
the synthetic oils, so I am hesitant to switch to dino oil.  Does
anyone on the list have any advice for me here?  Don?  George?  

If I do indeed decide to have this repaired at a shop, could anyone
recommend a good place to take the car in the West LA, Beverly Hills
or Santa Monica areas?  I recently moved here from San Diego, where
the car was regularly serviced by Black Forest, which, by the way, is
a shop I would very highly recommend to any P-fans in that area, as
they are great with waterpumpers, and are really good people to deal
with.  I am very close to a local P-dealer, but at $75/hr, plus
premium prices on parts, I would really rather not have them do this
job.

The collective wisdom of the list, I am hoping, will help me resolve
this, since I am getting tired of driving a car which now sounds a bit
like a VW.  I am also currently in the midst of attempting intallation
of an updated version of Girlfriend v2.0, and have experienced some
glitches while driving with the windows down due to engine noise. TIA
for any input/advice.

Sorry for the long post.
