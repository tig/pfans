I'll add my two cents to Gary's post, as I too this year went from a 911 to a
944, only mine is an S2, not a Turbo.

My 1988 911 was a great car in many respects, but I switched because the S2 is
basically equivalent in power (208 hp vs. 217 in the 911), but is much more
forgiving to drive on the track, has ABS, and is more aerodynamically stable
at speed (my non-spoliered 911 was a real handful at 130 mph at SIR).  Most
importantly, the S2 in similar condition cost only HALF what I sold my 911
for.  

For a brief time I owned both the 911 and a 1985.5  944.  In general, I chose
the 944 as a regular driver.  The S2, with its extra 60 hp and gobs of torque
is just icing on the cake.
