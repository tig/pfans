With the K-27T6, the shorter gears helped decrease the lag by an
appreciable amount but also shortened the duration of the "sweet spot"
of the upper rpms.  With the K-26S and Mass Air, the gears are
unquestionably too short, unless you're only interested in screaming
up to 60 or so (e.g. autocross).  The 0-60 and 0-80 times times are
impressive as boost is essentially instantaneous.   However, tirespin
in cold weather is annoying (1st through 3rd) and I find myself
shortshifting into 2nd very quickly to avoid bouncing off the soft
limiter.  My mechanic has encouraged me to go back to the long gears
with LSD which should make the car better suited for the track and
possibly quicker for autocross due to less shifting and the long
torque curve of the car.

As respects the XR-1 muffler, check out the Borla website at
www.borla.com as they explain the differences between their various
systems.  I'm pretty sure that the muffler is T304 stainless steel and
is supposedly more "free flow" than the cat back systems.  In terms of
performance, I'm not sure if it has made any difference as I did the
Mass Air upgrade at the same time.  However, the fellow 951 owner I
spoke of does claim that there is an increased level of performance
but I'm not sure how much.
