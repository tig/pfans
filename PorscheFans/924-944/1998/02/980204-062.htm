Fellow 944 Drivers & Mechanics,
  I have a serious problem with my 87' 944NA. When I started my car Monday 
afternoon, it ran rough, then produced a "pop" noise. I shut it off, opened 
the hood, and fainted. My car was bleeding to death!! 6.34 quarts of oil was 
flowing everywhere!! After calming down, and cleaning up the mess (2.5 hours 
later), I discovered that the oil filter gasket had been blown out! O.K., I 
thought, maybe just a defective filter? Replaced the filter & oil. Restart...
....chug, chug, chug, "POP." Blow oil filter gasket AGAIN!!!
   Panic time? I hope not. Called my local Porsche garage (Nort Northam) and 
guy says, "...oil pressure relief valve. 30 minutes labor + part." Part? 
$233.00 from Porsche. Yuck! 
  I wanted to poll "The Porsche Collective" here before I have the car towed 
over there to have them look at it. Does anyone agree or disagree with his 
over-the-phone diagnostic? Where is the valve and how do you get to it? If 
it only takes 30 minutes to change out, I might be able to do it myself and 
save the tow and labor. HAYES manual is no help with this. Any ideas would 
be appreciated??
