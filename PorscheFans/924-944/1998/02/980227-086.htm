In a message dated 98-02-27 19:25:02 EST, you write:

<< I finally got my K-27 chips installed today.  I'm not sure how much they
 helped, the car was very fast before.  I'll know more about how much the
 MFS helps.  I finally got the dyno scheduled for Sunday at 2PM.  I'll
 get another one after I get the MFS and let everyone know who is right
 and if it is really worth installing.  I'll also post the results from
 Sunday's dyno as soon as I can. >>

Cool.  You doing an excellent service for those of us planning on these mods
in the future.  I think the reason you got different info from Powerhaus and
Autothority is that they were talking about different engines basically, one
w/ K26 and one with K27 turbo.
