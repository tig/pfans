I'd like to get the collective wisdom/recommendations of the group
regarding repair/replacement of a bad ball joint on an aluminum control
arm 1987 944 NA. I intend to drive the car in drivers ed events. Can I
have any confidence in the various rebuilt units that are offered
around? Given that Fabcar is more than I want to spend, are factory new
arms the next best way to go? Is there a vast difference between factory
new and rebuilt? Any other choices? I stopped by Dynamic European today,
but he wasn't forthcoming about the parts and methods he used to
rebuild, which didn't give me a warm fuzzy feeling.  Auto Atlanta claims
to have a rebuilt unit with a pressed in spherical bearing that they say
is better than factory. Anyone have any experience with that? Please
reply direct as well as to the list. I subscribe by digest and would
like any info available as soon as possible so I can get my car back on
the road.
