I hate to bug the list for this but the parts guy at the Porsche dealer
can't find the part number.  I need the part number for the plug (square)
that goes in the top flywheel inspection hole.  Mine has been missing since
I bought the car and I was going to clean the engine Saturday until I
remembered it was missing.

Also, anyone have any pictures of their 944 with 15" Fuchs and 225/50-15"
tires.  I have 215/60-15 on all 4 corners and they need to be replaced.  I
want to go with the lower profile tire but I don't want the wheel well to
look too empty.  That will take the overall diameter of the wheel from
25.2" to 23.9.  I also don't want the speedo to get too far off from where
it is now.  Since I'll only do maybe 2 auto-x's and 2 drivers eds this year
I'm probably going to buy Comp T/A ZR.  The rest of the driving will be on
the street.

TIA
