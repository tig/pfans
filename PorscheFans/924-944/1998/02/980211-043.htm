You are correct, it is not a metal float, but I thought the concept was
better understood that way. Effectively what we are looking at is float with
locking relay, how it was implemented is through a sensor to a lock and hold
circuit ( now in 74 series logic) with a cap and drain resistor to keep the
lock engaged. 

Now if you look at the wiring diagram you will see what looks like an old
float & lock.

Bottom line, motor has gone onto start cycle (only place it gets checked)
and the oil level is more than ½ the way to low range marks. So the circuit
is set high.

So lets say your are on a long trip and don't stop the motor you can run the
oil level to zip, without the light coming on. (but it will be a long trip)

	Dan,
	    A Float? I thought it was an electrical sensor, not mechanical?
Although 
	my '86 944 is before the days of automatic oil level sensors, the PO
replaced 
	the engine with one that has an oil pan with the sensor in place.
When I 
	replaced the oil pan gasket last winter, I got a good look at what I
assumed 
	was the oil level sensor. It was simply a metal rod in the oil pan
with part 
	of the metal rod electrically insulated such that only the tip of
the metal 
	rod is exposed to oil. The exposed tip was at what I assumed was the
min. Oil 
	level. The metal wire is electrically insulated from the oil pan
where it 
	leads through the oil pan. Since I am missing the rest of the
system, I can 
	only guess as to how it works. I believe the electronics for
checking oil 
	level must measure AC resistance (capacitance) between this probe
tip and the 
	oil pan/block. When the capacitance reduces as the oil level falls
below the 
	probe tip, a level comparator lights a bulb on the dash.. Perhaps
there is 
	some hysteresis in the electronics, or a time delay to reduce false
errors as 
	the oil splashes around, but a float with a mechanical lock?? Just
my guess, 
	perhaps someone else can confirm this or let me know how the ckt
operates? 
	This is not intended as a flame, just trying to understand how it
works or if 
	perhaps what I thought was the oil level sensor is in fact for
another 
	purpose..
	Thanks,
	       Ezra
