Hi - hope someone can help:

My 91 951 has started playing up and, of course, the problems are
intermittent. For the last couple of days it has been missing at idle when
first started (stops after 30 secs or so), with idle also occasionally
hunting between about 800 and 1200 rpm.

Two days ago it wouldn't start when hot (changed the ignition/injector
relay and that seemed to fix it).

Then last night, after driving across town fine, stopping for 15 mins, and
restarting, it started missing quite badly. This time it didn't go away and
was also blowing smoke.

I stopped the car and it wouldn't start again (turns over fine). After
about 30 mins it started and seemed to drive fine for a while (no smoke
either). Then the throttle stuck open - foot off the accelerator and the
car stayed at 2000 rpm (or whatever it had been at). A couple of times it
slowly dropped back to normal after 10-15 secs - the last time it stayed up
until switched off. Then, it wouldn't start again.

The car is now in the shop (weekend here - this all happened after work on
Friday... of course!). I want to be able to give my mechanic some ideas on
Monday - anoyone have a clue what this might be?

I suspect electronics and/or sensors as the oil and water are fine, turbo
has boost, oil pressure and water temp stayed normal throughout.

Help!! Thanks,

Gary (dead Panther Black 951)
