Greetings,
In reference to Mark Leeber's question concerning which Car Care =
products to use, this would be a discussion that could go on forever. =
What has worked well for me for several years now is the full line of =
McQuires products. My 944 Turbo is black in color and takes a little =
more care than other colors of cars. My routine was and is as follows. =
I'll assume the car is washed.=20
1) Use McQuires Body Scrub to remove swirl marks, small scratches, and =
to clean the paint. (I went over car twice)
2) Follow by using McQuires Number 2 Polish to bring paint back to =
life.(Some areas twice, ie hood, roof)
3) Use Gold Class Wax as final coat to seal and protect.
4) After all the above, when washing your car, I use Zip Wax by Turtle =
Wax. It "suspends" the water droplets so as to wipe the entire car =
without water spots on paint and protects the wax on the car. (Great for =
hard water areas like where I live)
5) McQuires makes what is called Quick Mist. I swear by this stuff for =
those wipe downs before and after a cruise. It just makes the car shine =
and removes those pesky little things like bird droppings, etc. If you =
use a car duster or dust towel this removes the streak's that they tend =
to leave after several uses. It's great stuff and my shop has four =
bottle's on hand at all times.
Hope this help's. I'm sure other's swear by there own past experience's, =
but this has worked best for me. Check out McQuires web page for tips =
and tricks.
