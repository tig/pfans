 ««I am planning on replacing my plugs this weekend and want to try
these new Bosch tri-electrodes.»»  
Hi Samuel,
I'm sorry, but possibly I've lost something. Why not the new Bosch
Super 4? They have 4 (four) electrodes.
FYI, I have a set on my car, but I don't notice a very significant
improvement. Anyway, you can't expect to much differences between a
"normal" Bosch spark plug and a Super 4, if they are both new. I guess
that the improvement that some owners notice are due to the lack of
performance of their previous spark plugs, which are in bad conditions.
Of course, I don't know about durability and maintenance of performance
over time. I expect this is a plus!
But, as I put, usually, the best on my car, and they are not very
expensive, I think that is a valuable upgrade.
About availability from any store, when the car is in some way
different, as ours, the catalog don't carry them. It was my case, some
months ago, but the shop owner insist in searching and found it
elsewhere.
