     All this paint talk has gotten me thinking.  The PO repainted the rear 
     of the car and the clear coat has faded in the Florida sun.  My 
     question is has anyone used any of those products that claim to clear 
     up light oxidation?  The front of the car is beautiful, but the rear 
     is embarrassing me and that's what most drivers see :-).  I was 
     wondering if any of those products could clear up the paint.  On 
     another note, I'm also considering going full bore and re-painting the 
     car.  It sounds like the Sikkens paint is certainly the way to go.  
     Any idea what a reasonable price to repaint the car would be?  I want 
     it done right, but the car is a daily driver and not a concours model. 
      If it matters at all to the previous two questions, the car is Guards 
     Red.
     
     On another topic, has anyone had any experience with the rebuilt water 
     pumps from Auto Atlanta?  I've had experience with the company in the 
     past and they seem okay.  However, if new pumps from vertex are around 
     $200, I don't see any reason to not go new.  I'm doing timing belts 
     soon and want to replace the pump and thermostat.
     
     Thanks in advance,
     Samuel
