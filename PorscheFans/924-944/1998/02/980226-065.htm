 Can this be true?

 If you put a woman on a pedestal and try to protect her from the rat race,
you're a male chauvinist.
 If you stay home and do the housework, you're a pansy.
 
 (Big Snip for brevity)
 
 If you want it too often, you're over sexed.
 If you don't, there must be someone else. 
 
 
 SHEESH... We just can't win I! >>

Michael,

So, what's new?  Did anyone see the article on the study that showed that the
most successful marriages were the ones where the man did whatever his wife
wanted?  In case anyone was wondering (here is the P-car content), it was my
wife's idea to buy the car!  See, we CAN win!
