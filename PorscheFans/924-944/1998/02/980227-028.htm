It seem that the 924 was to be used in the same level that the Karman 
Ghia was. I remember in 72 when I was really young in Brazil, the 
porsche 914/914-6 was sold in the same dealer as the comom VW bug..

Don't forget, Isuzu, Hyunday and several other car companies that uses 
porsche as part of R&D.. oops forgot to mention SEAT in sapin that has a 
little car that it seems to be raeally a killer machine tuned up by 
porsche ( and owned in part by VW )

A lot of robotics but I think only on the bodie parts, not engine and 
seats  I guess.

Marv you outdone yourself again.. also we should remark no matter which 
model we have they are nothim more that direct descendents of a little 
VW bug with a hell of a lot of improvements and they are simply  direct 
developpment of a succesfull breed of racers...
