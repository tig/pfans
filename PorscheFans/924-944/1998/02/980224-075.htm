Is it possible to do something during balance shaft belt replacement that
would cause the shaft itself to bind and throw the belt?  Until I had the
balance shaft belt replaced on my 86, everything was fine.  At replacement
time, the shop that did the work said that the balance shaft pulley was
binding - and less than 3,000 mi later it has thrown the belt. 

Shop wants 14 hours to go in and see what the problem is - given the cost
of a look-see, I guess I'll tackle the problem myself - which brings me to
my next question - does anyone have a more detailed set of instructions for
pulling the balance shaft than Haynes(and if you've gone through this, how
big a pain is it)?

thanks
