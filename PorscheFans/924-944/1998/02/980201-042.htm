Subject: RE: Gear ratios vs. Speed
I've been following the thread lately on different gear ratios and speeds.
I happened to find a copy of an article out of the December 1992 issue of
Excellence related to this.  I thought everyone following the same thread
might be interested in it. It contains a comparison chart of the 944/968
series gear ratios....


Clark,

Knew we could count on someone and it figures you would come through with
the "straight scoop". Thanks for filling in many of the blanks. IMHO, those
final drive ratios and top speeds are the "real" issues in this idea.

First, a few minor corrections/comments:

1983 944 -- 5th gear .730,  I beleive this should be .829. My owners manuals
lists this ratio and I checked the gold portfolio and Motor in 1982 listed
this ratio as well.

1987 944 Turbo -- 4th gear .034, I'm sure that was just a typo because it's
really 1.034.

You asked about redlines and here's an odd little detail:  Regarding
redline, from the 1989 944 owner's manual:  944=6600rpm and 951=6500rpm. The
1988 owners manual: 944=6500rpm  944S=6800rpm  951=6500rpm. What happened to
the 944 in 1989 to cause the redline to raise 100rpm? Not that it's
significant, just curious.  As someone else posted, I can verify redline for
the 968 is 6750rpm. I also found a road test listing the 944S2 redline as
6400rpm. My owners manuals don't list anything in 1989 for the 944S2 --
Porsche must have produced a separate manual for just that model! Another
FYI -- the APE stage II chip raises the rev limiter in a Turbo 500 rpm. (The
data/top speeds I was using were all at 6400rpm.)

As I look at all this info, it seems clear to me that the 968 6-speed does
not just have another super low "highway" gear tacked onto an otherwise
normal 5-speed. My concern with the 951S has always been that it's difficult
to keep this engine in the power band. Although every track is different, I
really noticed this on the Michigan tracks I've run these past few years --
2nd unsettles the car and 3rd just doesn't have the pull. And of course the
same problem exist on the street, but just not as problematic as you're not
usually pushing the envelope like on the track. At first it seemed the 3.89
gearset was the "hot ticket", but I'm not willing to drive my car on the
highway in "4th gear" (or what the 3.89 would seem like compared to my
current 3.38 gearset). Sure 140mph top end is enough, but we can't ignore
what the 3.89 would be like at 80mph. The car is noisy enough with the
3.38!!

And after driving a 968 briefly (thanks, Lee), those ratios are wonderfully
close to each other and each gear change feels "just right". The numbers
looked good and the reality felt good. However, it was a 968 with gobs of
low end torque and not a 951. Even so, I like the idea alot.

BadBob -- I hope this all helps answer the question you posted the other
day. And yes, there is modification required between the torque tube and the
transmission, but from KMR that's a fairly easy modification... at least
from their perspective.

I was hoping someone else had already made this change and was going to give
us the "reality" of it all. Looks like I'm going to have to be the guinea
pig on this one, unless someone else beats me to it. Compared to massive
turbo chargers, super-chips, "O"-ringed and ported and polished heads, and
2.8L conversions, this seems like a modest change that could yeild
significant improvements. I'll keep you posted.

Still haven't heard from anyone with a 6-speed they'd love to unload! Humm,
maybe that will be the hard part.
