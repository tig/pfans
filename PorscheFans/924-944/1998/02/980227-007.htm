Gosh, I hate this subject, well, not really.

It is true that the 944 and 924 were assembled outside the normal Porsche
plant (I do not know where), but both cars were Porsche designed.  As you
know, VW was supposed to be the recipient of the 924 as a contract design from
Porsche.  VW pulled out due to some internal problems and Porsche kept the
train rolling and brought the project to the streets by itself.

Obviously, this isn't the first collaboration with Porsche and VW/Audi as they
are "family", but Porsche has a significant amount of revenue that comes from
outside contracts such as the Mooney-Porsche aircraft (uses a flat six
cylinder engine from the 911 and a few other innovations).  These outside
contracts are what keeps Porsches R&D alive.

The production facilities inside of Porsche was just too small to handle the
number of cars produced and had to be out sourced.  Even the Boxster has
suffered this fate.  Although, nobody would call it suffering.

The 911 series was always hand assembled, but that has been changing as new
assembly techniques are put in place to reduce cost.  Now the Boxster and the
911 can run down the same line.

No matter what anybody says, the 924 and the 944 are Porsche pedigree.  The
cars stand on their own accord and have garnered a following just like the
many other marques that make up the automotive world.

The truth is, if you love your car, what ever the make and model, and find
happiness owning it, then nobody can take that away with words without you
first surrendering it.
