I am fairly new to this list, but thought I might give some of you hope for
women and Porsches.  When I met my wife three years ago, I had a 944S2
which she like but did not really love or appreciate.  At that time, she
was driving a Nissan Sentra.  After some of my brainwashing, she moved up
to an Audi Quattro which she really likes.  I had to sell the 944 when we
got married, but bought a 914-2.0 as a replacement.  It was totally cherry,
Signal red and ran perfectly.  She hated it!  Recently, she has riden with
some friends in new Honda's and Toyota's and felt completely unsafe.
Really starting to appreciate the Audi.  About a month ago, the Porsche
gods shined upon me I -- I bought a '89 Black/Black/Chrome C4 while
visiting her relatives over Christmas.  She loves the car.  She always
wants to drive it (too much sometimes, becareful of what you wish for!)
She is even taking the PCA driving school in March.  Now she is even
complaining a little about the Audi's poor performance and starting to
joke? about getting a second Porsche for HER!

So in 3 years and 5 days she has gone from satisfied with a Sentra, to
wanting a Porsche of her own!  I am sure she would love the S2 now as well.
 When I tried to think rationally about it, the 914 probably isn't a very
good car.  It is great on the track, but I think sometimes we
Porschefanatics can be a little blinded by the marque.  I believe she may
have a truer view of cars now than I do.  How things can change.  Just my
experience with women and Porsches!
