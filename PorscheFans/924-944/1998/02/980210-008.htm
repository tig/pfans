The 944 Cabrio we're used to seeing (well, they're a bit
uncommon so maybe you're not used to seeing them) has back
seats (I've used mine to carry humans once).  However,
according Porsches '89/'90 944 S2 Cabriolet
Information Technik (WKD 495 721) the Cabrio Australians
got "are only permitted as two-seaters, for which reason
the rear seats are replaced by a cover.  In addition, the
split rear seat backrests are replaced by a
single-piece, foldable cover."

It sounds like the Australians got storage bins instead of seats in the
944 Cab -- like all the 968 Cabs.  Sounds much more useful.

T. Leen
90 944 S2 Cab. with useless rear seats ...
(and a roll bar going in to make using them even more improbable.)
