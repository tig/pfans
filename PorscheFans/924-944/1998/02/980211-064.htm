Clayton,

Could be they would rather rebuild yours than tell you how to rebuild them
yourself.

I had mine rebuilt by them about a year ago.  I think the ball joint is
actually held in by a monster c-clip.  The epoxy like stuff on the bottom has
a crack around its circumference.  They told me the epoxy does that sometimes
when it dries.  Evidently it's functioning as a grease boot as opposed to
holding the joint in.  He assured me it had no effect on the structural
integrity of the unit.  I guess we'll see this spring won't we?  ;-)
