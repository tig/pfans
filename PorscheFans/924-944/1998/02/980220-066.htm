I like and use Ate fluid. I don't know about Motul, but I pay about
$9 for a liter of Ate. Correct me if I'm wrong, but if there are
about two pints in a liter, then the Ford stuff costs about $6 a 
liter, vs. $9 for Ate. A huge waste of $$? Let's see, I change my
brake fluid about 3 times a year (April, June, August), so I'm
'wasting' about $9 a year by using Ate. 

Besides, by alternating between the Ate blue and amber, I know when
all the old fluid is out and the new fluid is in. 

I have heard good things about the Ford fluid, and one of my friends
is using it. It's good to know that you can probably pick some up
locally if you have to.

All true. Last year I used Performance Friction PF 80 compound. I am
very happy with that pad, and I see no reason to change. The PF 80
pads are reasonably priced, like $140 for the fronts (S4 / 951S size).
