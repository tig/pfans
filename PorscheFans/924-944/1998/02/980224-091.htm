Hello P-Fans
	There was a place called: Daytona Mig, I think in Daytona Beach, Florida.
They had some pretty cool portable mig welder that ran on 110V. I think they
use to advertise in Grass Roots Motorsports Magazine. Sorry I do not have a
address or phone number, go to the news stand and pick up the GRM magazine.

Good Luck

I would not even consider any so called "gasless" mig welder.  You will
be much happier with a regular mig.   Gasless migs use wire with a
special core designed to eliminate the need for gas.  However, it
doesn't work well at all.  The wire is more expensive, there is less
"milage" per roll, and it is MUCH more difficult to get a clean weld
without warping (if your working with sheetmetal).  Years ago, I
purchased a 110 volt century mig, and using a CO2/Argon mix, I was able
to quickly learn to weld anything.  It is by far the most valuable tool
I ever purchased.  I have tried the gasless versions, but I never would
have been as successful at learning with one as with the regular gas
mig.  Unless you have diffuculty getting to a welding supply to fill the
tank, or you don't plan on welding any sheetmetal, get the gas - there
is no substitute.  I have fabricated transmission mounts, engine mounts,
clutch release levers, frame reinforcements,  and have weleded complete
quarter panels, door panels, trunks, floorpans, you name it with just a
110 volt gas mig.  Hope this helps!   Craig
