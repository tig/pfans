Hi group,

Just did a belt change.  Found that the Porsche tool is absolutely 
required if accuracy is desired in setting tension although the belt 
itself has a great deal of tolerance to poor settings.  The tensioning 
process is simple to do but diabolical in regard to being precise.  Very, 
very easy to be off of your desired setting.

I found it best to pull the spark plugs and then spin the engine two full 
turns with a socket wrench on the front crankshaft pully.  Then back it 
up a tooth and a half to obtain a correct and repeatable reading of 
tension.  Just checking tension, resetting, moving the belt back-&-forth 
a bit, and then checking tension again won't do it.  Spin it two full 
turns and then back it up a bit for repeatable readings.

My impression was that most of the "experts" tend to error on the side of 
tightness.  Some go all the way to 4.0 on the gauge for the timing belt. 
 This is a very narrow belt and could be easily damaged by 
overtightening.  Over tension would only serve to do damage to the belt, 
leading to short life, and also overstress the bearings of the 
tensioners, rollers, and water pump -- leading to short life for them 
too.  Perhaps this is why water pumps seem to be mentioned so often in 
this group.

The belt depends upon its teeth for grip on the sprockets, not tension.  
The tension only serves to control whiplash & snaking while running, and 
to provide adequate grip on the water pump pulley that is driven by the 
smooth side of the belt.  Once enough has been reached, then more won't 
help.  Obviously too loose has its own problems but really be cautious 
about too tight as well. 

Good luck,
