Gee, I always thought Michigan had some of the nicest Summer weather in the
country, but now it seems we have some of the best Winter weather too.

No blizzards, no mud slides, no torrential downpours - mostly above normal
temperatures, partly to mostly sunny skies, and little or no precipitation.

Saturday was mid 40s and sunny - got the 928 out and went for a drive with
my wife and 3 year old daughter.

Tuesday was 50 and mostly sunny again - left work early and took the 944 
out
for some "quality time".

Admittedly it's raining today, but all weekend is supposed to be sunny and
40s again - I can hardly wait!

Sunday and Monday were equally beautiful, but I was out of town on 
business.
Anybody ever drive route 70 west out of Hot Springs, Arkansas?  In a rented
Cougar it wasn't much fun, but it in a 944 or 928 it would be a blast!  
It's
about 120 miles of two-lane with sweeping curves up and down hills, and 
small
towns every 10 to 15 miles - and the weather was almost as nice as here in
Michigan...
