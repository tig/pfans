     I receive the Newsletter in Digest format and there was a post on 
     yesterdays (2/9) email about a Porsche owner who has used AMS 
     Synthetic fluid in the transaxle.  I have an 87 944 NA that is used an 
     a daily driver and I am wanting to improve cold shifting and shifting 
     overall.  I am going to order some AMS today and change the fluid this 
     weekend and I was wondering if any of you had recommendations as far 
     as what weight to use?  The car has very notchy shifting especially in 
     the 1st to 2nd shift until the transaxle is warm.  As always all 
     feedback is appreciated.
     
     Thanks in advance,
     Samuel
