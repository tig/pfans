There seem to be some questions about Techron.

I understand that a member of our PCA Region (Golden Gate) was a/the key
Chevron chemist on Techron.  You may have heard of him: John Byrne.  There is
an article by Dave Coleman on John's RSR in the August 1997 Excellence.  (As
an aside, right about the time the magazine came out, John was unfortunately
crashing his car at Willow Springs at a POC event-- it is fixed now).  (Second
aside-- you can see my car in the same issue in Jim Pasha's tech article).

Anyway, I can ask John some specific questions about Techron for those
interested.  I am sure to run into him at some upcoming track event.
