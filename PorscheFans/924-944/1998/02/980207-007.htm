Terry,

I think that the 944S is a great car too, however, one size does not fit all. 
It really depends on the owners personality, intentions, and driving style. 
Porsche made the 944S to fit a niche market that follows the same niche that
the 911S has done in the past.  For some people the 944S would not be as
satisfying as another car (i.e., 944, 944S2, or any of the other marques
around the world).

The original thread on this subject was aimed at providing some details about
the 944S that one member had questions about.  If memory serves me well, his
quest was for a car with more low end torque than the 944.  If this was his
preference, he might well have been quite disappointed with the 944S, where as
other people may revel in it.

Good luck with your new purchase!
