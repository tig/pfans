Hello Brad
	I just got back from the 24 hours of Daytona, catching up on my e-mail. 

	I saw your post - in need of a clutch repair shop. A friend of mine has a
Porsche repair shop in Purcelville, Va ( 15 min west of Leesburg), a 45 min
drive from Washington DC/arlington area. Tom's shop is called "RedLine Motors"
his phone number is #540-338-1986. Tom's hourly labor rate is $45/flate rate
hour of work, he charges about 10 hours for a 944 NA clutch job plus parts. I
think that is a pretty good price! Fell free to call him, even iff all you
need is a fellow Porsche tech to talk to.


-Good Luck, Davidjalai@aol.com

Greetings,

Here's my sad story...
  - 85.5 944 clutch is toast
  - backup mule (Dodge turbo) decided to blow its head gasket
  - down to the LAST backup car (don't ask)
  - closing on our new house Feb. 27th!
  - of course, I don't have a garage until I move!

Does anyone know of a good P-car shop in Northern Virginia that can do a
clutch
replacement for a "fair" price?

Thanks,
-Brad
