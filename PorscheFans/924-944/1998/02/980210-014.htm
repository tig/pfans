Ezra,
      Sounds like an excellent idea to me.  I'm sorry I missed this post
the first time. Lee (Lichtenstein) suggested scanning the hard copies of
the manuals into computer and downloading them to CD ROM. I've already been
experimenting with scanning the hard copy of the workshop manual and I
believe it may be the most viable option. Although I already have the 944
parts microfiche, I'm also considering purchasing hard copies for scanning
purposes as well. I'd like to see someone pursue this in addition to what
I'm doing. That way we can share what we learn and decide what the best
format will be for the final version.

Good Luck,
Clark Fletcher
