A (one)100 watt bulb will draw/pull about 7 Amps. I think a 130 watt bulbs
pull more like 9 amps. So if you go with a maximum of 100 wt bulbs for street
use (more than this and you will melt the electrical connectors on the factory
wiring harness at the bulb connectors! ).

You will need atleast a 15 amp relay. The more amps the better. A 30 amp or 40
amp relay is just fine with a two headlight system. 

>They certainly weren't a "kit", just the relay boxes.

Some places sell just a bare relay. Others, like the ones I mentioned, sell a
complete relay kit, the relays prewired, just plug the connectors into the
cars headlight wires and battery location and you are ready!  I really think
that the complete harness is the way to go!  

The only draw back is that "most" relay kits use the Jap style relays (smaller
than OEM Porsche one)  and the crimped on connectors sometimes need carefull
inspection for good crimps. A little solder here abd there - helps out quite
well!

Look carefully at your RELAY! They are marked with a wiring schematic. 

Porsche (and most other German car manufactures) use a standard wiring code:

#30 is power (+ positive all of the time) - ie the cars battery
#15 is switched power (+ only when the ignition is on)
#85 is ground (- ,neg)  -  use a chassis ground.
#86 is the trigger (+ ,pos)  -  from your old headlights
#87 is the iteim getting direct power from the relay (ie the headlights)

>Also, how (again, details, please) did you perform your voltage check
>and exactly where did you place the tester wires?

Before I installed "my" relay kit, I pulled off one of the headlight
connectors and measured the voltage available at the headlight - using the
ground and positive (10 volts in my case) in the cars factory wiring harness.
I then compared it the voltage available accross the battery (12.8 volts). 

The reason the relays make a huge difference is that the electricity has to
only travel from the battery to the headlights instead on a mile of wires from
the battery, to the fuse box, to the headlight switch, to the headlights! 


Good Luck
