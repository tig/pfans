With both my son's 951S and my S2 we have experienced essentially zero =
oil
consumption.  Admittedly I've only driven my car a bit over 2000 miles
since I purchased it, but so far, no oil consumption.  My son's turbo =
gets
the oil changed every 3K or so and during that interval it uses no oil.
It is not tracked or autocrossed.

>Also, what kind of oil are people using with good results. I am =

In the turbo we (and the PO) have been using Mobil 1 15W50 and in the S2
the PO used Quaker State 20W50 (or whatever the local Porsche dealer =
used)
until I recently changed to Red Line 10W30 synthetic.  At the turbo's =
next
change we are also switching to Red Line.

I'm a big fan of synthetic oil.  I have an '84 Audi 5000S that had 180K
miles.  It still uses no oil between changes... and I've gone as long as
one year or 12K miles.
