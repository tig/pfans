I think i remmember a little note saying that the timing valve will not
actuate if there is a fault in the K/CP system.  Thus with a fault, the
voltage would be different.  Odds are you haven't bought the $35 code
blink switch to read out the K/CP codes, which means you can't find the
problem..  So, by the little swithch from my porsche.

As to what caused it - Did you rattle the exaust at all ??  When jacking
up the engine to replace the mounts you probably broke loose some of the
exaust gaskets.  An exaust leak will cause the K/CP system to limit
boost.  The only real way to find out with 100% percent certainty is to
by a mechanics stethascope ($12 at trak auto).  Just use the ear piece
and plastic hose (not the metal pole part) and move it back and forth
over each exaust joint.  If you hear air whistling you have a leak, you
need the stethostope to block out engine noise.  Jam a towel in your
exaust pipe also (to make leaks louder).  Any leaks and you need to
replace the gasket, if your car is old the might all be bad and have
crumpled when you banged the exaust or raised the engine.  So check them
all carefully.
