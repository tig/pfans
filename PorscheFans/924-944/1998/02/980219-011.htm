Thanks to Barry for the great explanation of heel and toe. The only thing I
would add is that some of you may find it easier to heel the brake and toe
the throttle. I know this goes against convention but, having broken my
ankle in two places when I was younger (don't ask how), I have limited
mobility in my right ankle. It is nearly impossible for me to toe the brake
and heel the throttle. So, I am forced to use the other method. A friend of
mine who was uncomfortable with the conventional heel/toe, tried the
heel-brake/toe-throttle method and finds it much more natural.  If you can
get comfortable with the conventional method, by all means use it.  Don't
give up on it until you give it a lot of practice. However, after you
practice it, if you still have trouble with it, try the "heel the brake and
toe the throttle" method.  Thanks again to Barry for the on-line driving
lesson.
