>Thanks a lot, Bruce Anderson!  I've had my '88 Turbo S on the market for

Why oh why do you guys not bring these cars up to B.C.???  Well, right now
is kind of bad with the exchange rate and all, but when things return to
normal, Turbo S's are worth a fortune up here.  There are so many buyers
waiting for a decent, non-abused car to show up at a dealer.

Prices for 944T's around B.C.:
89 944T, 44k km        $30,000 (US$21,400)
87 944T, 80k mi        $17,000 (US$12,100)
89 944T, 125k km       $21,000 (US$15,000)
89 944T, 120k km       $19,500 (accident damage listed on insurance)
88 944TS, 50k mi       $23,000 (US$16,428)

Keep in mind that we pay an additional 14% tax on top of those prices.

All of the above cars were decently maintained cars.  It's pretty hard to
find a really abused car here.  I've noticed that lately a bunch of 86's
have appeared that are not well taken care of, usually a fresh 16-year old
bought them, did a few too many clutch drops.  Facing a $3000 repair 
bill at the two decent shops around town, they put it up for sale
after swallowing the repair.  The only problem is, the car has decayed
around the driver with the leather in poor condition, etc.

If your car is low mileage, it will sell for a high price up here.  If it
has high mileage, don't bother because the price is likely the same as
down there.

>them at bargain-basement prices just to get rid of them.  I've met too
>many people who weren't Porsche enthusiasts and bought these cars new,
>to think otherwise.  A lot of 944s, especially the turbos, are being

That's one nice thing about our local dealer, they GOUGED their customers
for service work.  Most 944T's around here are well taken care of by the
original owner because the local dealer forced them to bring their car in
with threats of "if you don't fix it now for $1000, it'll cost $8000 later!"

>reducing the supply by putting mine up on jack stands in my basement and
>telling anyone that expresses an interest in it to take a hike (probably
>not, I'm just in a foul mood right now).

In the end, it's a matter of patience.  There will be someone who comes
along who wants that particular color and those options and will pay
whatever it takes to get it.

I can't blame Bruce Anderson for his numbers.  I'm sure he researches them
and is just trying to give people an idea.  How is he to know that prices
are higher in B.C. or that certain areas have higher prices.  I've heard of
nice 951's going for >$10,000 in some areas of the U.S.  Even my dealer
told me my race car will come from the U.S. because the prices are
much cheaper.
