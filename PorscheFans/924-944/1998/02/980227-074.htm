Hi Chris & P-Fans

	Ok, the gasket for the gas/fuel sending unit is #944-201-327-00, is look like
a black thick rubber-band. The gasket goes around the fuel level sender
unit/cylinder. Remove or unscrew the plastic securing device (a ribbed ring),
as you called it, disconnect the fuel lines (yes some fuel will leak out, use
some rags and unscrew the gas cap first to relieve the tank pressure, NOTE
which goes to where: One feed, One return! ). The fuel sending unit is just a
long cylinder about 4 inches wide and 14 inches long. I would do this when the
gas tank is low on gas! Remove the rear carpet for easy access.
	 I used a audio sound proofing tile just because I had one lying around. I
just wanted something to seal any fumes from re-entering the pass/cargo area
agian! You can use any kind of tile with a self adheasive backing. The audio
sound tile I used was made by "SCOSCHE" under the brand name "ACCUMAT", phone
#805-523-0687. I think a package of tiles cost about $25? I got mine from a
friend in the Biz...

	If you really want some of the same matting I used, I could stick one in the
mail to you. I live in the Washington, DC area. The tile is about 12 inches
square.

Good Luck
