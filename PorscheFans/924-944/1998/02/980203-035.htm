Fortunately, I bought my 944 before I even knew Wife 1.0.
But I constantly remind her how practical the hatchback is for
carrying groceries, what great gas mileage it gets (counteracts
my daily driver - a K1500 Suburban...), how easy it is to
park, etc.

Then she reminds me about buying expensive tires (currently
XGT-V4), the power steering rack a few years ago, the radiator
a couple years before that, extra insurance, etc.

But parts on lots of cars are expensive.  Buick burned me
$40 for a stupid drink holder which broke on my Regal.  Two
bits of molded plastic with a rubber ring.
