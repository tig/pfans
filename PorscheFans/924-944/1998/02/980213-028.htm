What actually occurred (at least to the best of my knowledge) was that the
original silver rose/burgundy plaid models were truly a limited edition
(1000 copies) to celebrate the '87 Euro Turbo Cup car.  At that time, the
factory was still shipping the 217hp version of the standard turbo.  They
discontinued the manufacturing of the 217hp engine, and when those supplies
were exhausted, they began shipping all turbos with the 247hp (S) engine in
the standard interior/exterior colors (latter part of the model year, but I
don't know just how many non-silver rose 247hp turbos they made).
According to the "Porsche Family Tree" (and, here I don't know if these are
U.S. figures or "world" figures), these are the engine serial number ranges
for MY1988:

217hp Turbo	45J00001-02070
247hp Turbo S	47J00001-01830

This sure clears up any questions, huh!!!!!!!
