Ok, Ok wait just a minute!!  first off theres no parking.  
Its not like my Fiance' runs a movie theater with a whole parking lot in town,
where she could probably get an all time best movie for a special showing.
Please!
DOPE! Did I say that??  I meant to think it:-)
I have already found an alternate site here in Lafayette if the whole Indy
thing doesn't 
work out.  Lots of trees, Grass, oh and drive slowly theres a 1/8 mi. gravel
road.  
Where does such a place exist?? It happens to be a scout camp here in town(it
helps
being an Eagle Scout and a close pal of the Ranger) Mind you Im still trying to
sink my 
hooks into the speedway, but it never hurts to have a back-up plan. Oh and Lee
there is power too so...yes I could bring the SUN and give tune-ups.HA! :-)
 (tour+diags+movie?+trees+fresh air+Porshe)
If Indy doesnt work Is Lafayette ok? its only 55mi North of Indy.
Safe Driving, laters
