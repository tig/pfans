Greg,

Although I agree 6 hours seems too high, I can't specifically recall what I
paid. My best guess is around 3-4 hours. You might ask to see the book rate
for yourself.

I would like to comment on this:  "I supplied the water pump..."

A friend with a 944S recently supplied his shop with the parts for a cam
belt change. Six months and only 8000 miles later the belt failed. Bent
valves and punctured pistons means repair costs around $3000. NOT WARRANTIED
because it was a customer supplied part. Many shops have this policy and it
seems to basically relieve them of any responsibility when something goes
wrong. Bummer!!

My recommendation is ask, and then get it in writing.

My shop will buy parts from suppliers I locate, when necessary. Although
there is sometimes a small markup, I feel it is pretty cheap insurance
should something go wrong.

Just my .02.
