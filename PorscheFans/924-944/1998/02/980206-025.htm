A friend has a 1987 944S that he broke a timing belt on (and the associated
piston/valve crash, etc).  He seems willing to part with the car for a
relatively small sum.  I have found a used replacement head for an equally
small sum, and am considering fixing it.  The Hayes manual I have suggests
that if I have not broken a belt, and want to replace it, I should, and
then drive immediately to a dealer to have it adjusted.  If the belt is
broken (which it is) the book suggests calling a tow truck.  Being that I
would rather do it myself, is there a manual out there that would better
describe the procedure of resetting the cam/balance shafts/crankshaft?
Is there anyone out there that has also broken a belt and had to deal with
bent connecting rods, smashed pistons, etc?  

Thanks
