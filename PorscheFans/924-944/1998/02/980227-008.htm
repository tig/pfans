Hi Pfans... Finished my 924 clutch swap last weekend... great to be
back on the road.  Today I thought I'd investigate the bubbly paint
on the fuel tank that I noticed while the transmission was out. 
Just a bit of surface rust, surely?.  No. A few swipes with the wire
brush and suddenly, I have a tiny but deadly high-octane fountain.
Lots of siphoning and calling round friends for jerry-cans, the tank
is now empty and I stink of four-star. The irony, of course, is that
I'll have to take out the transmission again, having just put it
back. Damn. So I phoned the local Porsche main dealership (just for a
laugh).  New tank =A31200 - that's UK pounds.(about $1,900 US)  A local 
specialist says he can de-gas and repair it for around =A335, so that's 
what I guess I'll do... Unless any of my Pfriends out there have any 
helpful thoughts or experiences to share?

1985 924 standard, smelly - no gas.
