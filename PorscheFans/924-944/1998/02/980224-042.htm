To Tom P. and the List:=0A=0ARegarding =93Club Sport=94 Parts for the 951=
=0A=0AThere is some confusion on the terms =93Club Sport=94 and =93Cup Ca=
r=94 and the parts=0Awhich carry those labels.  First of all, one has to =
recall all of the types of=0Aseries that ran 944 and 951 cars.  These inc=
lude but are not limited to the=0AEuropean Turbo Cup and the Canadian Rot=
hman=92s Series.  Plus you have to=0Aconsider the other types of racing i=
n the =9180s and =9190s where these cars were=0Asomewhat popular and/or c=
ompetitive, e.g., the Firestone Firehawk Series and=0Athe Playboy Escort =
Series.=0A=0AThere is also a difference between M030 parts that were avai=
lable as options=0Aon specific cars (and therefore available from Porsche=
 Cars North America as=0Aspares), and Porsche Motorsport parts, only avai=
lable from Porsche Motorsports=0ANorth America (PMNA).=0A=0AThe parts adv=
ertised by places like Fastech and Windward may be=0Amisrepresented.  Don=
=92t assume that you can=92t get the parts from your dealer,=0Aor an alte=
rnative aftermarket supplier, and maybe at much cheaper prices.=0A=0AThe =
best example which I can provide is the so-called =93Cup Car=94 clutch di=
sc,=0Awhich is simply a Sachs heavy duty unit that has a Porsche part num=
ber.  My=0Adealer couldn=92t get one of these from PCNA, so they got one =
from an=0Aaftermarket Sachs parts house-- much cheaper than the Windward =
price at the=0Atime.=0A=0AOn some parts, like the control arms, there is =
a specific difference.  Refer=0Ato Pano, June 1995 or the 944 FAQ for Alw=
in Springer=92s dissertation on these=0Aarms.  The bottom line on these i=
s that they have somewhat different, though=0Astill non-replaceable ball =
joints.  I=92d bet the bushings used by PMNA are the=0Asame M030 parts on=
 my 951s.  Why buy these when the Fabcars are not much more?=0A=0AI=92d a=
lso bet that the rubber strut mounts are just the Turbo S/=9289 Turbo M03=
0=0Aunits.=0A=0AI have a set of the Koni double adjustable shocks.  Bough=
t =91em at a swap meet=0Afor $20 each, and had them re-valved by Truechoi=
ce.  Truechoice can convert=0A951 or 951S single adjustables to double ad=
justables for a price, including=0Acustom valving, that is cheaper than t=
he prices for new ones as listed by Tom=0Aas having come from Fastech.  R=
ecall that some of the Porsche competition cars=0Aactually had Bilsteins =
(I think this is true for the European cars).=0A=0AI too have spoken to F=
astech, and have not been at all impressed.  When you=0Awant the facts, c=
all Arnold at Andial, PMNA, or one of the Stone brothers at=0AKMR.  David=
 and Jeff have both told me how their new =93competitors=94 at Fastech=0A=
got into business.  Interesting story indeed.=0A=0ABy the way, probably t=
he fastest of the factory cars were the Playboy Escort=0Aseries units.  J=
on Milledge raced one of these, and I think still owns one=0A(refer to Ex=
cellence Feb '88 for an article on Jon's car and the debut of the=0ATurbo=
 S).  I know that Dale Fazekas also raced one of these and still uses one=
=0Afor Club Racing (Dale is the guy at Terbatrol-- they make oil coolers)=
..  Bruce=0AAnderson is on record saying that this is one of the fastest c=
ars he has ever=0Adriven.=0A=0A- Mike Mitchell =0A
