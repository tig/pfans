I would like to get the opinions of the people out there with experience
with 924's.

I am looking at buying a 1981 924 turbo, but the guy who I am
considering buying it from says that 924's really don't make good daily
drivers which is what I would use it for.   He said that this is because
of the Bosch mechanical fuel injection system is very weather
sensitive.  I had never heard anything like this before so I was
skeptical.

So what are people's opinions?  Does this guy no what he is talking
about or do 924's make  good daily drivers?

Thanks
