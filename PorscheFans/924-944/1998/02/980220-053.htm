Tony,
The warm-up regulator (control-pressure regulator) provides the necessary
enriched mixture the engine requires during warm-up after a cold start.  As
the engine warms up, a bimetal spring bends and closes the diaphram to shut
off fuel flow and raises the control pressure which results in a leaner
mixture.  If your diaphram needs replacing, you should probably also check
the fuel accumulator at the rear of the car for evidence of leaking.  Also,
crack the fuel line at the bottom of the fuel filter and drain out the
gasoline into a clean container.  Check for black specks of dust.  If
present, then you have probably been using fuel additives too much or in too
concentrated form.  It's my theory that Techron, Chevron gasoline,  valve
cleaner, and so forth run through the fuel system dissolves the rubber fuel
hoses and diaphrams in the warm-up regulator and accumulator.
The price for a warm-up regulator is about $85.  Your prior symptoms should
be that the car starts cold, but it is hard starting warm, has poor idle,
and poor response at WOT.  A defective warm-up regulator is usually found by
running pressure tests or by a hand vacuum pump.
Best regards,
