Hi,

I am trying to get more Hp and torque out of my car without 
compromising drivebility. MAF kits have got a strong 
support from some of the aftermarket industry.
Teoretically,  the idea of replacing the flapper door with hot wire 
and reducing drag at the intake is good.

However, after  considering the cost of the conversion and the 
reliability of the kit as well as how much it actually improves flow 
over the stock flow meter the answer to -should I get it?- is not 
that clear

So far I heard from 1 driver who has run MAF for 3 years with no 
problem.
 Other two cars  currently run the MAF without prblems
One aftermarket supplier did not recommend the kit.
Other comment was that everyhing on the engine has to be 100%
to make the MAF work properly.

I would  like to learn as much as possible about the 
practicability and performance of the MAF.
Has somebody experience with MAF?
To understand all aspects of living with the MAF kit I would like 
to ask several questions;
How long have you run MAF on the car?
Have you had any problems?
Did you notice power increase
                         better throttle response
                         torque increase after installation?
What are the car specs? (stock, K27,test pipe, ported head,  
stroker)
Would you recommend the MAF kit after your experience ?   
Anybody has comparable DYNO results?

My car (87 951 S-modified, blk/blk) is used on track as well as on 
the street (K27 , Stroker kit, maybe, comming in the near future). 

Thank you for your response!

Roman
There is no substitute for experience.
