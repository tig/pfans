«Don't forget, Isuzu, Hyunday and several other car companies that uses
porsche as part of R&D.. oops forgot to mention SEAT in sapin that has
a little car that it seems to be raeally a killer machine tuned up by 
porsche ( and owned in part by VW )»

Hi Adrien,
if you are talking about the Seat Ibiza, these is what I know:
Some years ago, in the beginning of the collaboration between VW and
Seat, who ends up buying Seat (before that, Seat was a Spanish
copy of Fiat), there was a new car, the Seat Ibiza 1.2, who was
claiming the motor to be designed by Porsche. In fact, the fancy
letters PORSCHE was in the top of the motor, but everybody think
it was only marketing. The motor was nothing really special, and 
the car was underpowered for the weight (it has a solid, good quality,
 construction, except the chassis, which was to much flexible). The
result was a best-seller in the beginning, followed by the
disappointment of the customers, and now you can buy these cars
in any corner very cheap.
My opinion: is impossible to have everything at the same time. A
economic car and powerful, performance and heavy, and so on. Not even
Porsche can design this, but in fact, I think they rent their name for
marketing purposes. It has not affected the name of the company, just
because nobody believes it was a Porsche motor.
BTW, Seat makes some really good quality cars in these days.
