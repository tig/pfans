I just changed the oil for the first time on my 1991 944S2 last weekend =
and managed to dump oil down the side of the engine as I removed the oil =
filter. I purposely let the oil drain from the oil pan for about 3 hours =
(my daughter had a basketball game that I went to) before I removed the =
filter. There was still enough oil left to coat the side of the engine =
and the power steering pump.

Does anyone have any advise on how to change the oil filter without =
making a mess? I have changed oil on many cars but the filter is usually =
pointed up or sideways and is neat the bottom of the engine. Can anyone =
also shed some light as to why Porsche placed the oil filter pointing =
down and so high on the engine?

Thanks,
Dieter Schulze
