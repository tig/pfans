I posted this late yesterday, so I'm reposting today.
Hi list. I need a consensus opinion on a car I'm considering buying. Its an
89 951, champagne/black. Only 22,000 miles. IMMACULATE. Totally stock. All
records showing legitimate mileage. The owner wants 22500. He has other
interested buyers coming in the next week from out of state, so I have to
move fast. I've seen others with this low a mileage at similar prices.
   What do you guys think. I would sell my 88 non S, 127000 miles after
buying this one. Its in primo shape, needs nothing, Black and stunning.
Lots of extras. Great paint, polished flats. What do you think thats worth. 
    The reason I really want it is because my 88 will be  very high mileage
within 4 or 5 years and become very hard to sell. This one will still be
low mileage even in 5 years and much easier to sell. Also, I have S envy.
    By the way, Im in the bay area if that affects anything.
