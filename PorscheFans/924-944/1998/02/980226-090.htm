No problem and the cup wheels will clear the "big red" brake calipers, so
no problem there.  How do you like these wheels and the look on the 944?
I want them too :-)

I talked to RD Enterprises in San Diego (619-282-8550) this week =
regarding
just what you want to do as I also am considering the same thing.  They
quoted me $399 each for Turbo S type front struts that are *double*
adjustable Konis.  They quoted me $224 each for S2 single adjustable =
Konis
and the rears are $104.  All items are in stock.  Either one should be a
bolt on operation with no problems for clearances, alignment, height, and
you don't need to replace the steering knuckles or control arms unless =
you
want the big brakes without using adapters.
