Howdy,

I took the car to the shop last night.  I had the sales manager, the parts
manager and the service manager all doing their best to ensure that I was
happy with their shop.

Mistakes happen, it was Friday the 13th :)  The key difference between a
good shop and a bad shop is that a good one will take responsibility for
their actions and stand behind their work.  This shop did exactly that
and more.  I cannot stress how happy I am that the shop took this route
of action.

Not only are they going to re-paint the panel and sort all the other
stuff out, they also gave me a nice car to drive while mine is in the
shop.  The 993 I was supposed to get was being shown today to a client,
so they gave me an 89 Carrera instead.  I really didn't want to take
the 993 anyways, I wouldn't be able to show my face there if something
happened to it while in my care.

I'll talk about my driving impressions in my next email.  Anyways, I
wanted to just let the list know that all is well, the shop is excellent,
they've really gone that extra mile this time.  I've got a whole
new respect for the guys that run the shop and would once again highly
recommend them.

Farzaan.
