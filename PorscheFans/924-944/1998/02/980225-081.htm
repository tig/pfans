Gas welding:  When this thread started, I said that gas welding could be
used on thin metal.  I guess I should of made some kind of disclaimer.  I=

said nothing about body sheet metal or car frames.  Even a good gas welde=
r
can make a body panel look like the rolling ocean if the heat and tacking=

are not right.  Why anyone would use a gas torch to repair a structural c=
ar
part is beyond me but obviously it has happened.  This said, I would like=

to point out that I have made some gas welds on exhaust headers and pipes=

that I would be proud to hang on the wall.  I do not disagree with what t=
he
others have said but I believe there are uses for gas welding in an
autoshop.  Not everything can be MIG or TIG welded.

110 MIG welders:  I am pleased to hear that there are some quality 110
units on the market.  It has been a few years but I had poor experience
with friend's 110 MIGs.  When neither they or I could make the machine la=
y
down a good bead, we would have to haul their project over to my machine.=
 =

Since then I have stayed away from the 110 machines.  Not any more, a goo=
d
portable 110 MIG welder would really be handy to have. =


Inert gases:  Unless you are welding all day or are really cheap, use
straight argon.  Hands down it is the best welding gas.  The mixtures may=

be cheaper but they do not work as well.
 =

A good stick welder makes satisfactory welds.  A good MIG welder can be a=

real artist.  I stand corrected, a good 110 MIG welder would be the way t=
o
go.
