Cruising to work on the freeway with the top down and enjoying the first
sunny and warm day in a long time I find myself approaching an earlier model
951. I stay behind him, but after a few miles he pulls over one lane and
slows down enough to let me pass. We check out each others cars and as I
wave to him he is giving me an upward thumb. I just made me feel great. To
me, that is (also) what Porsches are all about. The bond between people who
normally would never have noticed each other, but show mutual respect
because of their love for the finest in automotive design and performance. I
suspect the driver was one of the "true" Porsche owners. A nice change from
the mainstream around here where Porsches are something you have because
they look good in your driveway and most owners would never recognize
another Porsche if it happens to be painted in a different color and much
less if it happens to be a different model.

Is it common in other parts of the country (and other parts of the world)
that Porsche owners acknowledge each other with a nod or a wave (much like
the motorcyclists)?

Can't wait for the weekend. My baby will be getting a much needed wash and
shine and then it is off for a little driving along the coast!

Happy motoring to all!
