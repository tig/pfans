Since the Torsens were mentioned I thought I would throw in my 2 =
bits.(and make everybody jealous in the process)
Back in 1982 (on or about) when the Torsens first came out I purchased =
one for my Shelby Gt-350 vintage racer. It offered a great improvement =
to the handling.....and cost a little under $500.00 new!! I can't figure =
out how the current selling price has been arrived at. The guts of these =
things are pretty neat but there are not 'rocket science'.
BTW the Torsen is still in the Shelby and has not been opened up since =
it was installed! A real no maintenance unit. If not for the price I =
would install one on every motorized vehicle I own. (Torsen equipped =
riding mower?? - it could lower my yard lap times!)
