Nick,

I've just picked up on your thread for a midwest PorscheFans meet and if
you're not too far along on the Indy idea I have another suggestion --
Meadowbrook Concours & Waterford Historics in Detroit August 1st and 2nd.

Similar to Monterey, Porsche's 50th anniversary will be celebrated as they
will be the honored marque. The 356 group is planning a pretty major event
with cars from the Zuffenhausen museum as well as plenty of street Porsches.
There will be Porsche corral at  Waterford and the concours will also have
quite a number of Porsches participating.

I'm the one organizing a group for the Monterey event and also plan to
attend the Meadowbrook/Waterford activities because they're only about 15
minutes from where I live. I've been in touch with the folks organizing
these Michigan events and would be happy to refer you to them if you would
like to know more.
