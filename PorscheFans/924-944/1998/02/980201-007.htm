All:

    I would like to put my 2 cents in here ... I think we all can agree the
value of our 944/924's is percevied more in how much we love them not by
their book values. I bought my 83 944 for $2500 .. so far I have replaced
the belts, front engine seal, valve cover gasket. Fixed a cooling problem
and cooling fan problem... amoung other small repairs to the tune of $1000
... I just purchased new (used) rims for about $400, I'm putting on new tires
this week for around $400.. then  she is going into the body shop for dent
removal and new paint job to the tune of $2000 .. That will make my total
outlay for the car around $6,300 .. would I ever recoup that investment .. I
don't think so ..I think most of us would agree .. we put much more into our
cars than we would ever expect to recoup .. is it worth it  .. You better
believe it .. everytime I get in the drivers seat and hit the accelerator on
the highway or when I hit that curve and I amaze at how well she handles ..
it all seems to be worhtwhile

Rich
