Michael,

I had this problem myself a number of years ago.  What I did was remove 
the fresh air blower from the car, then tear down and clean the motor. 
 This involved taking the end cover off the electric motor, removing it 
and the bushings/washers (don't remember the exact parts list).

I believe the key to success was lubricating it with a suitable heavy, 
non-melting product.  I tried white lithium grease the first year, 
didn't work.  Wheel bearing/CV grease the next year, didn't work.  On 
my third try, I used Bosch distributor grease which has the consistency 
and appearance of ear wax.   That did it, and the blower has been quiet 
ever since.

I don't remember where I got the grease, but it's in my current copy of 
the AutoMotion catalog (DG-9000).  The Olista Longtime 3 EP grease the 
Porsche sells for clutch applications is about the same 
(000.043.024.00).

Kevin
