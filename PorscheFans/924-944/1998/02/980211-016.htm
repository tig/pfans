The story is partly correct.  McDonnell Douglas (before it became part of
Boeing) did the forensics of this accident.  The story is so wierd that it
has quickly become a legend.  The driver even won a Darwin Award (the one
to die in the most stupid way wins it) for it and variations of the story
are popping up all over the place.  One of my friends works at Mac and
told me what happened.

The car was not a Porsche, more like a 66 or 67 Impala with aged
suspension and a JATO strapped on it.  The aerodynamics were not keeping
the car on the ground and the suspension was not dampening the bouncing
action.  It was airborne (from bouncing) when it fatally missed a turn and
slammed on a canyon wall 100ft off the ground.  The rest of the article
about the estimated speed and the molten brakes is accurate.
