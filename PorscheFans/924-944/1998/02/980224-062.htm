First thing that comes to mind is brakes.  The list price for the front 
calipers is $499.00 each, the front rotors list at $293.50 each and the 
rear rotors list at 207.80 each.  This makes the total for brakes alone 
$2000.60.

Also, the M030 front suspension wasn't just a different shock.  The front 
suspension was coil-overs and I believe (could be wrong though) the rear 
torsion bars remained the same with the addition of coil-over helpers.  The 
M030 on the 968 was a more substantial upgrade than the M030 option on the 
S2.

On my 93 968, I have installed the big brakes from a 89 951 (bigger pistons 
than the 968 M030 caliper, same pad size) and the M030 torsion bars. 
 Hopefully this season will see the suspension upgraded to full coil-overs 
on all four corners.  After which I guess the only thing left is a turbo 
:-)  (Yeah, like I need a 450 hp 968!)

I'm a little confused as to Matt's pricing the M030 and the wheels 
separately as the complete M030 package did include the 17" wheels.

P.S.	My entire brake upgrade with cryogenically treated rotors (extra $200) 
only cost $1300 and knowing then what I know now could have cost less. 
 E-mail me direct to find out how.

Matt --

Sounds like a lot of money for the 968 M030 upgrade.  What else is included
besides replacing the basic components like shocks, sway bars, and t-bars?
