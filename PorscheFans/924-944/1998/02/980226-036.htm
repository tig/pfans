Last week I posted about my A/C and heater not working in my 944na.  As for
the A/C, I'm having the 30,000mi service done next week with the water pump
& belt replacement, so I figured just throw in the recharge while we're at
it.  Hopefully that will fix that problem

As for the heater, though, I've gotten nowhere.  But yesterday morning I ws
running the car with the radio off to listen for some new noises I thought
I heard, and caught a couple associated with the temp control that I'm sure
are related to my heater problem.  When I turn the temp control to a high
temperature, I hear some rather loud ticking from behind the dash for maybe
5 seconds.  Almost sounds like something is stuck or a gear somewhat
stripped.  Then if I turn the control back to a colder setting, I hear just
a couple of ticks, and a 2-3 second hiss from the same area.  Unforeunately
I haven't ahd a chance to look any further into the problem, but was
wondering if someone could tell me what exactly is behind the dash related
to the heater that could make these noises.  Is there some sort of flapper
that might be stuck?

Thanks again for the insight.
