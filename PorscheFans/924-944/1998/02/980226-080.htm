Matt,
         Darrin is "down under" that is why his price on Splitfires is =
so high. He probably cant order from US parts suppliers. No flame just =
thought you may not have noticed.
         As for the split electrode design what I have seen posted (don't=
 remember if it was this list or I used to read the 928 list so it may =
have been there) was that after a few minutes of use the spark favors onl=
y one prong of the split electrode so there theoretically wouldn't be any=
 advantage to using these designs.
         That being said I have used Splitfires. I replaced them with Bos=
ch single electrode WR8 is that right? ( it was *8* I am pretty sure). =
I just replaced the Bosche's with AC Delco Rapid Fire. These have a taper=
ed splined single electrode. My results are very preliminary and I wasn't=
 going to say anything yet but since this came up I'll say that my gas =
mileage may be improved over the Bosche's.
          I had a drop in mileage a few months back and it may have been =
when I replaced the Splitfires. I should keep a log of these things :-) =
 I'll know for sure in a week or so after I've gone through a couple of =
tanks and will let the list know.
