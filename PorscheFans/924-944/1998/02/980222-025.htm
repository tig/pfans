Jad:

Compare your C4 with the 951S or '89 951 as did a friend of mine when we
swapped recently.  You might change your mind as he did.

Gary,

Having owned a 924, 944, 944S2 and now a 964 C4, I have to agree that
the
944 series are better all around cars.  They ride smoother, get better
gas
mileage, have a LOT more cargo room, cost less, etc, BUT the 911's are,
in
my opinion, the best car in the world to 'drive'.  If you are on a
twisty
country road or autocross track the 944's are great fun, but not the
complete experience that the 911's are. 

I am fairly new to this list, but one other completely seperate
observation
I have is that there seem to be an extraordinary number of lister with a
Porsche and Audi Quattro just like myself.  Is it just me or have others
also noticed this?  I think the Porsche is the best car to just drive,
whereas the Audi is the most fun you can have while hauling people and
things around.
