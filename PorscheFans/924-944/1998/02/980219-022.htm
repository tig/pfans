Ed,

This is my first reply to the list, and hope i've done it correctly. I
owned an '84 944 several yrs, then an '86 944T for a few months (wow!) ,
and recently bought a '94 968 coupe, 6-spd. I have used them for
everyday driving. They are all great autos, and I love the 968 - it's
strong, tight and still comfy on a long trip,  the better fuel economy
is a nice bonus, and when you flick on the hi-beams at night you'll be
astounded! 

Like many, i endured the usual 944 probs w/ motor mounts, water pumps,
and timing belts, but loved those machines nontheless. And while i'm
certainly not an expert when it comes to 944/968's, my overall
impression is that the 968 is definitely refined and improved. I test
drove a 968 w/ the sport suspension and 17" wheels, and while it hugged
the road like a slot car, it was too stiff for me. If you've not driven
a 968 yet, you are in for a treat.
