Everyone: 
The message from Chris points out the kind of information I thought I 
could get from this list, but unfortunately very few people replied 
to my original (2 postings).  I felt $225 was a lot for the wheel, 
but I need the wheel now.  I appreciate the response from Chris and 
others, but how come it took several days for people to respond?

One thing I noticed is that maybe people on the list only scan the 
subject and don't have time to read through the body of the post.  If 
you didn't have a wheel to sell, then maybe you didn't bother to read 
any further.  I actually posted several questions in the same 
message.  One was about the replacement hoses on the power steering, 
the other was about where to find the wheel if someone on the list 
did not have one to sell.  No one responded to the power steering 
question from that post.  Only 2 people responded to the question 
about where to find the wheel.  I called the suggested salvage yards 
and they had no phone dials in stock.  So...  I found wheel 
enhancement off the Web and called.  The rest is history.
Since the car is not drivable and the next El Nino storm is on the 
horizon, I paid more than the wheel is probably worth, but at least 
it should arrive in todays UPS.  
 
My question is:  Should we post only one question at a time and is 
that the approach most of you use?  Is it better to post each 
question,  or ask several questions on each post?  I would have 
preferred to save the extra $100 and don't want to go through this 
again.
