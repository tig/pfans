Pfans and Jim Crow,

I just got 4 new tires and an alignment at NTB as well.  First of all,
anytime you get 4 new tire$ you should probably get the alignment at
least checked, (which NTB will do for free).  They show you a print out   
    

of where you should be and where you are.  I am not sure if they could
fudge this if they wanted to.  Anyway, get the alignment if you need it   
    

so your new tires wear correctly.  The car I just bought had uneven tire   
    

wear that looked like out of spec toe.  NTB "exotic" alignment for 944
was 79.00, and I got 10% off because I waited too long the last time I
got my other car aligned.

BTW, you can get Tire Rack prices at NTB:

I called up and asked if they would mount tires if I brought them in
(thinking I would order from Tire Rack).  They said sure and told me how   
    

much and asked if I wanted to make an appointment.  I reply, well, I
don't have the tires yet, I have to order them.  From where, they ask.
 Tire Rack.  Why don't you order from us?  Because your prices suck.  Oh?   
    

 We can get them for 139 a piece.  Tire rack price: 93 and 99.  They then   
    

proceeded to call tire rack and call me back, matching the price,
discounting it back for the tax so they matched my to the door price from   
    

Tire Rack.  And they have a better warranty than Tire Rack.

The bad part, after they had my car for three hours, they couldn't finish   
    

the alignment because they ran out of fuel for their torch (I guess the   
    

bolts are a bitc* to get off).  Anyway, I have to go back this weekend to   
    

finish.  But my car drives soooo much better.
