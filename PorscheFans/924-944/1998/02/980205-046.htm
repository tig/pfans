Regarding bad drivers, don't forget...

1) the 137 year old man with his 131 year old wife driving the Olds Ninety
Eight, peering through the pinhole size opening between the cataracts in
their
eyes, sucking oxygen from a tank in the trunk.  These are the people that
have
no peripheral vision and no concept that there is anyone else on the road.

2) the 63 year old cranky old man that knows everything about everything,
hasn't stopped smoking in 45 years, hasn't showered since the Reagan
administration and hasn't washed his 1963 International Travel-All ever but
feels the need to drive 10 to 15 mph BELOW the posted speed limit just to
ensure he has time to puff down a few more cancer sticks.  Again, no concept
that there is such a thing as someone else on the road.

3) anyone natively from Minnesota (I was born in IL and raised in WI)
