Thanks to Paul Zwerner, David Greenburg, Roxanne Geary and Wes Shew for
their input.  All good information.

Here is what the pre-purchase inspection turned up today:

1.  Rear View mirror missing (was broken by previous tire kicker.  Owner was
already planning on fixing)
2.  Drivers side rear side marker lamp inop (probably just the bulb)
3.  Needs front tires (already discussed with owner).  Wear pattern is even
on        the fronts, they are just in NEED of replacement.  Rear are brand
new.
4.  Minor leak at rear of valve cover
5.  Minor seep at power steering hose
6.  Exhaust hanger broken, causing exhaust to hit torque tube
7.  Passenger side power seat inop
8.  Small tear in passenger leather seat (about 1/2 the diameter of a #2
pencil eraser)
9.  4 inches of trim missing from passenger door map pocket
10.  "Porsche" emblem is missing from Rear hatch.  Just says S2.
11.  Missing service records past 60K.
12.  Water leak at top of rear hatch on drivers side.  This has caused the
headliner to expand in that area and will need replacing.
13.  Small hairline cracks on driving light and turn signal lens. (you
really have to get close to see them).

That is it.  Car runs strong, idles smoothly.  Most of these items are
cosmetic that will be addressed with the current owner.
Item 12 is my BIGGEST concern, followed by item 7 and 3.  I am not as
concerned about the missing service records because I had a face to face
conversation with the mechanic that serviced the car for the first 90K of
its 110K life.  He confirms the first owner was a fanatic about his cars and
maintained it well.  Also, new clutch and timing belts at 103K miles.  Even
the mechanics doing the pre-purchase says it is obvious it has been
maintained well.

The water problem is not extensive and appears to be new.  Jurgen (the
previous mechanic) said it was not there when he worked on it.  No rust or
anything of that nature.  Carpet or underpadding is not even water damaged.
Just the headliner where the cardboard underlay has "swollen".  They are
going to take it to a trim shop in the morning and see if they can determine
what the fix for the leak will be.

The water appears to be entering in the area of the latch on the drivers
side at the top of the glass hatch.  Also I am concerned about the passenger
side electric seat.  This could be the motor or simply a switch.  The rest
of the items are an easy fix and mostly really small cosmetic items.

Any experiences with these problems from you Porsche Aficionado's?  Any help
would be greatly appreciated.

Cliff James
