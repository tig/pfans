I think the PCar was first. Wouldn't it have been funny if Porsche had

<<<BTW, I thought the NYT article was OK too.  Then again, I'm the guy 
who's 944S was on "911 and Porsche Worlds" list of the ten worst 
Porsches.  "A flat spot the width of Albania."  I am saved only by the 
fact that I live at the moment in a country where damn few of the 
locals know where Albania is, let alone its width.>>>

Critics. Who needs 'em?

Whenever I think of Albania I think of that Simpson's episode when Bart
stomped grapes in France while the exchange student stole nuclear
