Hi P-Fans,

On the subject of exterior car care, I use Auto Glym. It is a British
product used on Aston Martin and Rolls Royce cars.

I have been using it for more that 8 years now and it is truly
excellent. The only inconvenience is that it takes a lot of effort and
time applying it, especially if you use both the super resin polish and
the extra gloss protection.

The super resin polish removes all the dirt and grime build up
throughout the year (especially if you live in Montreal and use your car
during the winter) but it does not cut into the paint. That process
usually takes 3 hours of applying and removing. it is a creamy solution.

The extra gloss protection is not for the faint hearted, it is more of a
petroleum, oil based liquid and takes for ever to buff, but the results
are simply spectacular. About 2 more hours of work. By this time you
have sufficient wax on wax off drills to rival any Kung Foo master.

I am not sure if it is available in the US but I know that they have a
distributor in British Columbia (where Farzan lives) (Canada) prices are
around USD10 for each product, much more reasonable than Zymol.

Have a good day.

When will Porsche produce an SUV, we need one badly for winters here,
and it's gotta be a Porsche. (a V8 300 hp with a 928 plush feel to it
sort of a  ML430 killer)
