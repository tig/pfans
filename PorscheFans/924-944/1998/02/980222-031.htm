Hi, friends,

I have some great BBS wheels on my 84 944 guards/black, but when I bought
it there were only two Porsche center caps, both on the rears.  BBS wheels
usually have a very deep center cap, not the crest.  I want to get the nice
crest center caps on all four wheels.  

Unfortunately, the bearing covers are rounded outward enough to interfere
with the flat OEM center caps, so the set that I bought won't fit over
them.  I don't think they can be tapped in since it looks like that would
affect the speedometer cable sensor. 

A local shop, Wheel Techniques, has suggested that I put some spacers
behind the front wheels, which offsets the cap enough for the center caps
to fit.  They put one on and had me test the car last week at speed, and it
didn't _seem_ to wobble or otherwise negatively affect the car.  They got
six turns on the lug nuts with the spacer on.  The shop is going to put the
spacers and center caps on my car next week and polish all my wheels and
lug nuts to a deep chrome shine, balance, etc. etc.  They also are going to
put Automotion's theft-deterrent clips on the inside of the caps so I don't
have to remove them during track events (since the whole wheel has to be
removed in order to get the caps out). 

Does anybody have any other suggestions for dealing with BBS wheels and the
beautiful crest center caps besides the spacers?  Thanks for your experience.

Where am I going, and what am I doing in this handbasket?
