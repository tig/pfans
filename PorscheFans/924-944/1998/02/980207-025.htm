It's funny that this discussion is coming up now as we are right in the
middle of a project to do this in my Yamaha FJ1100/FJ1200 mailing list
group.  I'm not involved in the project other than as a supporter and
customer but have followed the conversations regarding this project with
interest.  The major issues were:

1) Copyright.  There are NO copyright notices on the Yamaha films and a
call to their customer service received a blessing for the project.
2) Scanning.  After trying some manual scan and conversion, the guy doing
this project sent the films out to a professional firm and had them
converted to digital images (tif).  Then Gary cropped, reformatted and
sorted the images.
3) Viewer.  To manipulate and view the images, you need a viewer.  Gary has
been using a program called ACDSEE.  It's shareware. As the images are
probably going to be in gif format, you could probably use any type of
viewer than runs on your platform.  There is also the MAC/PC ?? but I don't
know about that part of it.
4) Cost.  CDs are going to cost US$15 each.  I can't remember how many are
being sold (maybe 50 or so?).  I don't think Gary is getting anything for
all his time and effort so some of us are offering to pay $20 just to make
sure he doesn't lose any money on the deal.

If you are interested in a digest of the project, see the following URL.
