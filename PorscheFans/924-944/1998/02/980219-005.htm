Nick,

Sorry I missed the original posting.  Is this a 924/944/968 gathering,
a Porsche gathering, or a Porschefans gathering?  My wife and I have
been planning to visit an old friend of hers in Indianapolis this summer
who bought a 928 of her own last spring.  I was planning to drive my
928 partly because we thought it would be fun to compare them (neither
of us knew the other had a 928 until last month!) and partly because the
944 just isn't up to long distance driving until I put some more work
into it.  To be honest, I haven't had my 928 long enough to feel
comfortable driving it on a track, but the idea of getting together
sounds good to me.
