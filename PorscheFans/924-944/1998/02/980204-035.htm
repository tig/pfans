I have unfortunately missed a lot of the details concerning the recently-
discussed gear changes for the 951 and Turbo S.  What are the reasons that
people would consider this?  Are most of those interested talking about track
cars?  Or are some/most talking about a desired "improvement in drivability"
for the street?  Could it be for "bracket racing?"

It seems to me that changes in the gearbox (different gears, different ring
and pinion, or six speed 968 box) would be very expensive compared to what
you'd get as an outcome.  Of course, dedicated track cars notwithstanding.  I
vaguely remember pricing the ring and pinion change as costing more than $2k
or so.

If I were to consider the expenditure of the significant funds to make my 951
more drivable, I would spend it on the engine, starting with custom chips.  If
I had big bucks to spend (say $3-5k or more), I would call Milledge and have
him cook up something special.  This can make the car more enjoyable, and
faster than snot.

Of course, for those (not unlike myself) interested in DIY projects, a gearbox
rebuild with different parts, or the fitment of a 968 box could make an
interesting challenge.  DIY of course would make such a project significantly
more affordable/justifiable, even if you had to buy special tools.

I must readily admit that I had a chance to buy a 968 box and all of the
fabs/parts necessary for installation into a 951 at somewhere between $2500 -
3500.  I can't remember the exact price, but it was from a track car that
wrecked at Summit Point? during its first weekend of use.  This may have been
a bargain-- probably was.
