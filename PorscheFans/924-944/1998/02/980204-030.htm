John,
According to the Montreal Protocol in 1990, the US agreed to phase out =
R-12 by 2000 because of the chlorine in R-12, but this date probably =
will not be met.
R134a has been run successfully in 944's with few alterations to the =
cooling system.
Some thoughts:
(1)  If you do not plan on keeping your 944 more than about 4 years, =
stay with R-12 for economic reasons.
(2)  R-134a is less efficient than R-12 and must operate at higher =
pressure, so normally the system components should be larger and more =
robust.  Since the airflow across the condenser must be increased, =
you'll have less cooling in city traffic and reduced engine performance =
with R-134a.
(3)  The trade-off for using R-134a is you will be doing your bit for =
the Clean Air Act.
(4)  If you go to R-134a, you need be careful in substituting mixed =
components which could cause the system to fail. (E.g., the R-134a =
service valves are completely different.)
(5)  The R-134a system, because of the higher pressure involved, is less =
likely to be as reliable as using R-12 in a system designed for R-12.

    Greetings,
    It was recommend to me that since I was going to need the Air =
Conditioning system recharged this spring why not convert to R134a =
instead of Freon. This is a well taken point. What are your thoughts on =
this? What parts/cost should be expected? Lee, I would like your =
feedback on this as well as others.
