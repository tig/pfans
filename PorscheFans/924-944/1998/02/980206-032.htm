        Hi everyone! I havent talked to you guys in
a long time! First my question, while accelerating upwards
to about 80 or so the heater-a/c seems to come on another
notch. Is this a fault or normal, I have replaced the heater
release valve recently as the heat would never stop..
        Also on Wednedsay we had a huge snowfall
which is still continuing here in Evansville, Indiana, and
my 86 951 180'd right onto the side of the road and its still
there, I think today were gonna get it out, Ive driven the
car 3 times now in the snow, the 1st 2 times were great but
this time the car would not gain traction nor stop.
        And I got my new control arm installed, the car
now corners great!!
-Well thats all for now, Have a safe weekend!
