I've spoken with numerous other drivers who swear that the XR-1 is the
way to go.  Less than $200 retail (I've heard the $800 and $900 Borla
and Tri-Flo cat-back systems are not worth the money) and the sound is
very throaty.  The muffler is much louder than the stock setup and I'm
tempted to put a polished muffled 4" tip on to tame the decibel level,
especially for highway driving (I also have the short gears from a
944S2 so the car runs at higher rpms in general).  As respects
quality, Borla is very well known and reputable.  I'm not sure about
the weight but my muffler has a 3.5"inlet/outlet andf the muffler is
only about 4" tall, 6" wide and 14" long.  I'm experiencing some
resonance underneath the car at 3500 rpm but I think that's due to the
use of the factory hangers.  A fellow 951 driver has the same muffler
(and gutted cat) with 4" pipe and a big tip and its sounds great!
