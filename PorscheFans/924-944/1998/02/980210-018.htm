> However are you saying a faulty knock sensor won`t cause excessive
pinging?
Not on any Porsche I have seen, at least those with stock chips. The
idea is to tune the car properly, and only use the knock sensor as a
safeguard.

There are real problems with tuuing against the sensor:

1. A faulty sensor, signal or connection could cause damage to the
engine, as your question implies.
2. Once knock occurs, it takes a significant reduction in ignition
timing to stop it. So, if you tune against the sensor, you keep cycling
way below optimum timing, creep back up towards the pre-set level, hit
knowck, and go back to less timing. The end result is that there is more
power available from a properly tuned engine.

Today's faster electronics mitigate this to a great extent, but we are
still far from the concept of "active" engine tuning.

Actually, the KLR on the 944 Turbo.
