Well, I have this to add to the NSX/Porsche debate:

Hondas were my favorite cars for the past eight years.  Until I purchased my
944T.  Sure, Hondas have excellent reliability, but, they are 'soulless'
machines.  I really liked my Civic EX Coupe:  started everyday, rarely had a
problem (dash lights, warped rotors), and got great gas mileage.  I even
thought it was fast.  Enter the 944.  Well, what can I say?  There is no
comparison at all.  Of coures this is a US93$13,800 Civic compared to a
US87$29,000 944 Turbo.

I have only sat in an NSX, never driven one.  My Honda service advisor drove
one and advised me that it was everything I thought it could be.

After a few late night drags with NSXs, I must say that it is less.  I have
never seen the back of an NSX from the cockpit of my 951. :)
