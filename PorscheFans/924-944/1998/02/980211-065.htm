Hi Jason,
This is a very common occurrence in colder climates.  I have the beige
sludge on the underside of my oil filler cap every winter.  Moisture
accumulation in the oil, which migrates to the filler cap.   
The Caveat - if you have oil in your coolant expansion tank, than its the
dreaded oil seal problem, and you should have it looked after pronto!  
You say rust on the dipstick?  This sounds ominous.  I have never seen this
on my cars.  Check those oil cooler seals before you lose a bearing or worse.
