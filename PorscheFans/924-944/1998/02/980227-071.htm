My engine undercover was discarded by the PO, and I haven't missed it.  
It makes maintenance and oil changes easier and less messy.  I suppose it 
a) might decrease wind resistance under the car, and b) might deflect 
rain away from the belts.  I do get PS belt slippage for a few moments if 
I hit a deep puddle, but thats harmless.  A friend with the under pan 
present gets belt slippage from puddles with his pan installed, so who knows?

My 1989 has a cooling duct that runs from the alternator to the inside of 
the bumper, to pick up cool air there.  An alternator will last longer if 
not 'cooled' by the already hot air in the engine compartment.  In the 
summertime, with the AC on and the alternator running a high load, this 
is especially important.  It is a known fact that an alternator's 
amperage production decreases slightly with heat, as well.

If the tin shround behind the alternator is missing, replace that, along 
with the duct.
