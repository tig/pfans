Samuel,

I too have an '87 944 NA and I too had a serious
problem with idle at one time.  Your symptoms are
similar to mine except for the knocking (i.e., mine
didn't knock).  After warming up, idle was fine.

To make a long story short, my CO setting was way
off.  It should be 0.6 +/- 0.2 (something like that) and
mine was at 2.4.  Too rich for the idle stabilizer.  I
believe you car idles when warm because of the O2
sensor kicking in (it does whatever it takes to get
everything right and would force the CO down).  All it
took was an adjustment of a small screw that is
located near the air-flow sensor.  Of course my
mechanic did it with the aid of emissions equipment.

Don't know if this is your problem, but It couldn't hurt
looking into it.

Good luck
Karl
