If it hasn't already been lowered, you should be able to get the rear about
3/4" lower using the eccentric adjusters.

Working alone without a lift will take you about 8-12 hours. It sounds like
the front may be too low already so you are probably best lowering the rear
as far as the adjusters will allow, then raising the front as required to
reduce the rake to the desire level. I say this because the front arms / ball
joints are not going to be safe with the front dropped really low.
