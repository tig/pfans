Ole Olsen and Lenny B. Ramjattan - 

In response to your Audi / VW heritage questions, the answer is simple.
Lenny's history is almost correct, except for the fact that the 924 was a
Porsche designed model.  As early as 1973 VW wanted Porsche to design a
sucessor to the 914 for the VW lineup, and it came in the form of the 924=
..
But VW faltered and gave up on the idea of building it as a VW, and Porsc=
he
bought their own design back.  All 924's and 944's were made at Neckarsul=
m, an
Audi plant North of Ingolstadht (where the Audi A8 is made today).  But t=
he
engines starting with the 944 2.5 were all Zuffenhausen, in fact they are=
 half
of the 928 block.  

The relationship of Porsche/ Audi/ VW is that of a constortium.  VW owns =
Audi
outright.  It looked like Porsche was going to be bought by VW in the ear=
ly
70's, but Porsche managed to retain family controlling interest by going
public (stock).  But the companies all share parts and designs.  Some not=
able
on the 944 are the CV joints and most electronics (Bosch).  But make sure=
 the
VW/ Audi part you buy is correctly matched to the Porsche standards befor=
e you
buy.  Most VW dealers have a cross-reference list availble.  You will see=
 the
four rings and the VW sign on many parts, just look for them.

Hello P-Fans

=09If my memory serves me right, Porsche took over production from Audi f=
or the=0A924/944 series II, sometime in 1988. I thought starting with lat=
e =9188 M.Y.=0Aproduction, the cars were all built by Porsche in Stutgart=
.. 

=09Does anyone else have more light to shed on this subject?
