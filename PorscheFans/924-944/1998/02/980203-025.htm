OK here the scoop on the new "G-Force R1 from B.F. Goodrich.  This is a 
compilation of my chats with a couple of BFG R1 product managers at SEMA 
this past November, talks with BFG via their 800 number as a "Team T/A" 
member and with a long conversation last night with the local racing tire 
supplier.

First, they have not yet been officially announced to the public by BFG, 
therefore for you and I, they don't exist.  Second, as BFG has become the 
title sponsor of TransAm racing for 98, they are working feverishly to 
create tires for that series pushing the production of the G-Force to the 
back burner. And third, the few tires that will become available this 
season will, realistically, not be available until July, maybe even August 
at the earliest.

As to the characteristics of this tire, BFG claims it is at least 1 - 1.5 
seconds faster than the Hoosier, no longer has the asymmetrical sidewall 
therefore it will require, for optimum performance, more negative camber 
than previous R1s.  Figure somewhere in the 2.75 - 3.25 degrees negative. 
 It will last as long as the current R1, maybe longer.  It will eventually 
be available in 18" sizes.  The tread appears to be silk-screened on it is 
so shallow.  Possibly more shallow than the Hoosier.  BFG recommends a heat 
cycle for optimum life just like the Hoosiers.  And finally prices will 
remain approximately the same.

I think that covers it.  If I have forgotten something or you have a 
question, e-mail and I will see if my contacts can answer it.

In the most recent BFG Team T/A newsletter, there is a picture of the new
tire.  I might have already trashed my copy, but I do remember it looking
completely different from any previous models.  Also, I thought I read that
it comes only in the shaved version.  But, I have been known to be wrong.
