Denny,
    Thanks for summarizing the gear ratio thread for us. I had compiled
something very similar to what you posted but, was hesitant to put it out
on the list because I had compiled it in a Word 7 table and figured it
would come out as garbage.

   I'm still gathering information on the 944 gear ratios. Several members
verified .829 for the 944 5th gear from their owners manuals. However, I
again found the .730 number for the 5th gear in an old 944 owners manual.
Could it be that the 1983 944 used the .730 5th gear and later models used
the .829 5th gear? I may be asking for trouble here but, if everyone that
owns a 944 will check their owner's manuals an e-mail me with the model
year and gear ratios, I will compile the results. There could potentially
be a large number of replies here so, I recommend you e-mail them only to
me and not post them to the list. This will avoid cluttering the list. I
sure hope I don't get 1500 replies out of this.

Thanks,
Clark Fletcher
