There are indeed new pumps available, and I wouldn't recommend anything
but.  The Porsche pump rebuilding program tends to yeild poor results (on
the other hand, I've never heard or ahd a problem with Merced-Benz rebuilt
pumps), building pumps with very short life spans.  Some rebuilders may do
a great job, granted, but there's no way of really knowing if your pump is
one of the good ones.

As for the price...  I don't know if this is average or not, but I jsut got
a quote on a new water pump for my 85.5 944: $400.  Still, $280 might be a
little high for a rebuilt.  Although Performance Products sells rebuilts
for $129.50.  What confuses me is they say an additional core charge of
$100 will be refunded upon return of your old pump....  I can't imagine
their pumps end up being only 29.50, so that $129.50 figure is probably
AFTER core return.  And remember that if oyu have an older 944 (pre-1986 I
beleive) that has not had a pump replaced since 86 (again, I'm winging it,
don't remember for sure), you will need a water pump update kit for the
newest pumps to fit.  I believe the kits run about $60.
