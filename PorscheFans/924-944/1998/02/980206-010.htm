I haven't heard of anyone being able to scan anything from microfiche into
a format for the PC. Although I beleive the technology exists to get the
microfiche into a usable format, I haven't convinced anyone to try it yet.
For example, it is possible to take photograph negatives to a good
photoprocessor and have them digitized and put on to a computer disk. I'm
almost positive that the same technology will work for microfiche but, when
I spoke to the photoprocessor (Wolf Camera), they didn't seem willing to
give it a try. I really believe this would be a great option for us since
it sounds like it may be a while before we can get our hands on any of the
factory CDs. I'm still trying to find someplace that is willing to tackle
this. I have a keen interest in this because I have a lot of old factory
microfiche for Mercedes Benz as well. If I get any more information on
this, I'll let you know. I'd like to hear from the rest of the list to see
if they think this is possible.
