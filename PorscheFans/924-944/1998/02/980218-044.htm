Heel and Toeing is one of those topics that can turn into an ugly opinion
fest, so understand that this is what *I* do.  It may not be the correct
way.  This is how I was taught by a racer three years ago and it works
fine for me.  Barry and others with more experience may have better
methods than I.  I look forward to seeing other techniques.

I wrote this a long time ago and edited for the 944 list:

This is what I do when on the track or at auto-x:
1. Floor it down the straight
2. Pick a point to hit the brakes, I get on the brake pedal with my toe or
   left side of my foot about 20ft before I'm going to 100% braking.  For
   the 20ft before full braking, I give perhaps 70% braking to get the
   pads up to operating temps.  On a track day, I find this saves the
   pad from glazing and gives me much more braking power when I do get on
   them after the 20ft.  Overall, I can brake later than the guys that romp
   on it 100% right off the bat.
3. As the car slows, you get a feel for when it's safe to pull a downshift.
   If it's your first time, please ensure that the speed has dropped
   sufficiently for the next lower gear.  I don't want to hear about you
   shooting valves through your hood or something.
4. When you are about to pull the downshift, you put the clutch in, your
   TOE (on the 944, it's more like the left part of your shoe) is pressing
   the brake pedal at 100%.  While you are sliding the shift knob into the
   lower gear, you blip the throttle with the right side of your foot or your
   heel.  The gear should literally slide in with no synchro action.  Once
   the gear is in, release the clutch.  The key is to match the revs to the
   lower gear.

If all is done right, the car should be slowing down at 100% under braking
without any jerks, but you are now in a lower gear to take advantage of 
exiting in the proper gear.

With my level of experience, about 3 years of track events, I still drop
a gear a time.  If I was racing, I would only drop one gear in a corner
(ie, 4th to 2nd rather than 4th-->3rd-->2nd) to save the gearbox from
unnecessary wear.  As I currently am, I'm not good enough yet to do that,
it takes a bit more finesse than I can muster :)  I did try the one gear
drop method during the last track day and was able to do it pretty decently,
but with other cars around, I still did the one-at-a-time method to ensure
I don't send engine parts through my hood while paying attention to the
other crazies around me.

Heel/toeing on the street is difficult on the 944T because the brake
pedal is quite high, but on the track, it all becomes perfect.

On the street, when you downshift, you should blip the throttle before
engaging the lower gear, it really saves synchros.  Even on upshifts in
cold weather, matching revs can only save wear on clutches and synchros.

If you want to see the reason for heel/toe downshifting, stand at the
end of the straight and watch the cars under braking.  Those that don't
know how to do it will have their back end jumping around, sometimes even
locking their drive wheels and generally will look very sloppy.  Those
that do know will look smooth, you won't even know they are downshifting,
except for the noise.
