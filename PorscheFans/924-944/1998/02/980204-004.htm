Amen, brother!!! I most definitely hear you. Down here in Miami, the
drivers have gotten EXTREMELY aggressive. It seems to me that it is no
longer a defined group in this southern metropolis. It seems everybody
has this thing of "got to get there quickly" sindrome. Beats me what
they are thinking but they have gotten very uncourteous on the regular
city streets as well as the major highways. I can handle slow traffic
during rush hour, if it is for a valid reason. I very much dislike those
"Rubber-neckers" croning their heads around to see other people's
misery. It's as if watching the Floriday Highway Patrol giving a ticket
to some other driver for driving single occupant in the HOV (High
Occupancy Vehicle) lane would make their troubles seem less painful and
less significant than the way how it felt before. Anyway, Alex, what
you've said is so very true about the youth and how they parade about in
their Jap cars. I never owned one, ever. The latest trends I've seen is
that they'd add wheel spacers to stick their tires way out of the wheel
wells. What's the idea behind that? I thought that would create
excessive strain on their wheel lug studs. Then I've seen how some kids
would switch the bulbs in their rear parking lamps and insert them into
the amber turning signal bays. Some drive about town with their hazard
flashers on as if it was some sort of "disco lights" in concert with
their booooooming noise pollutants. Nothing against QUALITY sounding
stereos but if it distorts and sounds awful, good grief man, turn it off
please!

Cellular telephones are a wonderful advent but, in my opinion, they can
pose as a safety hazard to motorists and others around them on the same
road they share. To me, I think the driver would end up dividing more
attention to the conversation at hand than to the other vehicles around
them. Then the driver would have to deal with trying to hold on to the
handset whilst shifting a manual gear selector or even the steering
wheel itself. If anything, a statute ought to be enacted to force all
cell phone owners to at least install a vox (or hands-free speaker/mic)
unit to eliminate unnecessary distractions. 

Concur! Turn signal indicator stalks are NOT listed as an option on any
manufactured vehicle throughout the world. Even motorcycles have turning
indicators installed from the factory. Why in the world do many, many
drivers neglect to pick up on the habit of using this courtesy tool?
Perhaps the use of their turn signals would make up for their cutting
you off and not looking back attitude, not to mention their speeds as if
they are on a race track. Maybe they ought to invest some time and money
in Drivers' Ed? (Of course, it wouldn't be anywhere as much fun and
precise as if they were in 944's like we own!!!)

To all on the list, sorry for the excessive length. I realize that this
should have been posted on the Flamers list. But then again, these are
some important issues some drivers out there should take great heed to.
Comments welcomed.
