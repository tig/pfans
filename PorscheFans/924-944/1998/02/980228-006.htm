Hello Brad & P-Fans

	I would deffinitly replace your rod bearings. They are the first thing to go!
For any car that sees the track a few times a year or a dedicated race car, I
would replace the rod bearings once a year. They are cheap insurance on peace
of mind. They only cost $80 for the bearings themselves. 
	Are you running an ACCUSUMP? I would!!! An ACCUSUMP is a device that holds
2-3 quarts of engine oil under pressure, and supplies the motor of oil
pressure for those few moments that is needs it.  An ACCUSUMP sells for around
$500 for everything you will need. You can find out more by contacting
CANTON/MECCA the people who make the ACCSUMP, at 1-800-OIL-PANS.  No kidding
that is there phone number! 
	If you do not pan to use a accusump, you might want to upgrade the oil pan
and windage try a  from a latter car. Porsche improved the oil baffles in the
latter cars ('88 and up. ???). I think all the parts will run about $500 also.
May try to find a "slightly" used one from people like George B. >? 

Good Luck
