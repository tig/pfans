Whoa, Clark, I've never complained about any quirks and bugs of the 944. As
far as I'm concerned, it has none, and I intend to keep my 944 even when I
get another 911 series. I  owned MGB's for many years--now, there's a car
with quirks and bugs, and I managed to love them just the same.  But even
the MGB has armrests and door handles, unlike the Speedster. 

I've also owned plenty of Z's, used to refurbish them and sell them. And
when the ZX came out, it was too much luxury and not enough sports. I've
always cherished the thought that they would come out with a 320 someday,
that would be closer to its real sports car roots, and I would buy one of
the first ones off the line. But so far, my prediction has not held true.

Anyway, I'll be off the list for the next week on a cruise. I'll try to
catch up to everybody next weekend.  Just so you don't think I've gotten
quiet suddenly. ;-)

Kerry
