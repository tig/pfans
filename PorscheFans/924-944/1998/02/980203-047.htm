Apologies for the length of this item.
I ask for help here as I know I am among experts. My NA 944 is now runing
fine since the clutch slave cylinder was changed at the weekend. It had to
wait a week and was leaking so badly by the end so that driving it was a bit
stressful. Each time I changed gear I felt that it might be the last time.
The reason for the delay in fixing it was that my Volvo 940 turbo had
developed a head leak that was really serious and causing a slight misfire
on start up and  poor running. I had noticed a small amount of coolant loss
earlier but we've been going through some torrential rain over here recently
and now its down to below freezing every night and working on a car after
work was not a warming prospect. O.k it's not canadian beltfest stuff, but
it was bloody cold in that garage three night after work last week.
So, the head is off, checked and skimmed 8 thou' to remove a small etch in
the surface, valves cleaned etc, refitted and and all should be o.k.
Engine is now running quiet with no coolant loss.
The problem: sorry to take so long to get there, on accelerating the turbo
comes in and the boost gauge moves to the right, centre zero gauge with no
calibration, but the turbo will not hold the boost for more than a few
seconds (3-4) and backs off.
I have checked all the hoses for secure connection and am confident that I
all electrical connections are sound.
Any suggestions as to what might be wrong here? Everything was running fine
(well obviously not everything) before the head was taken off.
I appreciate that you might send me to the Volvo list, if there is one, but
I can't think of a better bunch who know about turbos.

TIA

Incidentially I split two sockets getting the head bolts off the Volvo (14
mm). They weren't Snap On quality (one was Kamasa which I think used to
offer a lifetime guarantee!) but nonetheless that was a first for me. I was
rather pleased afterwards since I thought it was the head bolt at the time.
