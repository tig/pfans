I live in Portland, OR.  In August 1996 I found an S2 Cabrio
in San Jose, CA [via internet ad] with about the right
miles (42k) and price for me. I quizzed the owner about the
maintainance, mechanical and cosmetic condition, and
he FAXED me some of the maintainance records (very
incomplete).  I flew down, drove the car, had a mechanic
check it out.  The mechanic found an oil leak at the
auxiliary cooler in the right front fender.  He tightened
it, ran the engine for awhile and was satisfied.  I left a
deposit, and returned several weeks later to drive the
car back to Portland (~700mi).

When the 45k service (belts etc) came up, I had my mechanic do another
go-over and he turned up no problems.

If you're going to do this, my advice to you is to book the mechanic
appoint well before you travel to see a car -- it can be impossible
to get in on short notice, and you definitely want it checked out!

good luck!!
