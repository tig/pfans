njomele@webtv.net  requested refs on shops in nj/pa area - i can throw in
      my .02$US for Ray Catena Porsche/Jaguar on Route 1 in Edison, NJ.
      (732-205-9000, i only spend $$ there, am not connected) Within two
      weeks of getting my 90 944 Cab, the radiator fan stayed on, came out
      of the office to no battery.  the building guy (i have other names
      for him) jumps me from a portable charger, then crosses the positive
      charger to the frame, getting it stuck inbetween the frame and
      battery terminals.  Sparks, smoke, a great improvised welder as it
      tore a hole in the frame!  now the car is totally dead.  i figure
      every electronic component is now history, or the fusable link.

      call to the Ray Catena dealership, service advisor Roman Flom, just
      minutes before they close......he sets up to get the car next day,
      miracle of miracles, only the battery is gone!  They could have had
      me coming and going.  I left it there for a week, had them go over
      everything and do the 60,000.....total cost was reasonable, didnt do
      extras.  (honest i cant remember the $$, can check if it helps) spoke
      to the head porsche tech, John, who is keen on watercoolers, easy to
      talk to, and helped me through some work i needed to do.  parts
      manager russ werner was also great, too.  AND the dealership itself
      treats you great!.  (nice to drool on the 'other' cars, too)  they
      are between exits 10/11 on the NJTPK.  a real class act for my
      experiences with them.
