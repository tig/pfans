I've got the same problem on my S2, only mine was quiet before the
preventive maintainence. Had both belts replaced and retensioned at two
different Porsche dealerships, and now I've got a whine in one of the
rollers.  Mine is a more noisy after driving, then it is at startup. 
Really makes you nervous about having anyone touch your car, even
supposedly good Porsche mechanics.
