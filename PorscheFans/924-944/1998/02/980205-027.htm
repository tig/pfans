Hi all,

As some of you know I've been rebuilding my engine for my '89 944 turbo.  Here
is a brief synopsis of what I've done so far.

*ruined motor at Heartland Park.  A 2 year old 2.8L andial engine with K-27 (w/
APE's chips for that engine).  Jim Richmond's engine builder had a detailed
explanation of the engine failure from looking at the pistons from that engine.
 If anyone is interested I can forward that description.

*Removed motor and tore it down.  Removing the motor was pretty straight
forward.  I now have bunches of zip tie bags laying around with various little
parts in them.

The only minor problems I had with removing the engine were the following:  I
couldn't remove the motor mounts from the crossmember.  So I couldn't remove
the cross member from the motor.  I ended up dropping the motor with the
crossmember still attached, then removed it.  The next problem was removing the
motor from underneath the car.  We tried to use the engine hoist to lift the
car.  First we tried some to lift the car from areas in the engine bay, then we
tried the tow eye.  None of it worked.  The best method was to use the floor
jack (a pretty good size one) to jack up the car from the passenger side front
jacking point, and remove the engine from the side.  Worked great and
considerably safer than using the engine hoist.

*My only tip for dissassembling the motor is to take your time, keep organized,
and remember how things go back together.

*Once dissassembled my pistons, crank and block were history.  (I could still
repair the block).

*I bought a used motor from an '88 turbo.  I paid $350 for the motor, the bad
thing is that the motor was in a car dumped in a lake.  From this motor I'm
using the block, crankshaft, connecting rods and flywheel.

*I had my original head machined and had to get new intake valves.  The shafts
of the valves were below tolerances.  All the valves are being seated ($5 a
valve) and the machinist is removing any burrs in the intake ports.  Hopefully
I'll pick up the head tomorrow.  One word of caution, I'm using an engine
builder who is used to dealing with Ford and Chevy's.  He is a good guy, but
everytime I come in with some tolerance specs he says "Good God, those
tolerances are huge!",  then I say "It is in millimeters"

*The pistons from the '88 car had severe pitting problems due to the
corrosiveness of the carbon and water.  Also the tin plating was coming off.  I
decided not to use these.  Jim Richmond sent me a set of pistons in exchange
for the beat up 2.8l pistons.  I'm going to be using those.  Thanks a million
Jim.

*The block from the '88 car had severe corrosion in the 1st cylinder.  I sent
the block to Motor Works Inc.  in San Diego.  They inserted a Lokasil sleeve in
the 1st cylinder and honed and lapped the other three.  Total cost for the work
on the block was $730.00 I haven't got the block yet so I don't know the
complete work order.  The sleeving process involved boring the block, heating
the block, and dropping the sleeve into the bore.

*I sent the pistons with the block to Motor Works for measurement.  They came
up within spec.  When I get the pistons back I'm having the engine builder in
town balance the complete assembly ($75).  I'll also have him fit and put the
rings on the pistons.  I'm currently looking for Goetz rings.  Mike at
motorworks recommended the Goetz rings over the Divas rings.

*I'm having the bushings in the connecting rods replaced.  They seemed a little
loose with the original wrist pins.  I'm also buying new wrist pins.  I sold
the Carillo rods from the orginial engine to John Joseph, who is aspiring to
build an awesome 944 motor someday. :)

*The Crank is going to be polished.

*The '88 flywheel is going to be machined.  The '89 had already been machined
once, so I decided not to use it.

That's all for now folks.  Hopefully by the end of next week I'll have all the
parts for assembly.
