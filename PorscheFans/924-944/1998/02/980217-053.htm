Dale,

I must second Hansmans opinion of Sikkens paint.  Insist on it.  No 
paint man is even allowed to use it unless he's been trained in its 
proper application by Sikkens.  I reckon my testimonial may even be a 
tad more persuasive as my job was an out-an-out PARTIAL.  That is, 
entire driver's side from front left 1/4 to the seam above the 
tail-lamp cluster + both side view mirrors and a fresh set of stone 
guards.  30 days after the job, my painter had me return so he could 
rub-out all UNpainted surfaces to effect a better match.  Afterwards, 
I had non-Porschephiles asking me if the car was new; and my car has 
nearly one earth-moon distance on it.
