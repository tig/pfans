Hi, Matthew,

On a recent airing of PBS' "Car Talk", Tom and Ray gave high marks to
this method.  They also had a lady call in to report on repairs using
this method after her car had suffered hail damage.  She said that when
they were through, she couldn't tell that there had been any dents at
all.
