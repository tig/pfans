	Well, I sent in my registration form for Parade, but I don't know
when they will be sending out the acceptances.  Seeing as how large Chicago
Region is, I don't anticipate any problem in getting accepted......besides,
I have attended the last 13 consecutive Parades and don't want to miss this
one(the primary reason that I couldn't commit to Denny Voss's trip to
Monterey in August).

	I have done some preliminary investigation over the internet,
although I don't have the information here at work today.  You might try
going to the PCA website, accessing the Parade site.  There might be a link
to Steamboat Springs there.  Or, you could possibly try
www.steamboatsprings.com.

	Count me in on your list.
