On any car that I've raised boost, I always drop a heat range or two.
On all my previous cars, I've run only NGK plugs, mainly because I know
an R&D engineer there who has provided some excellent info to me.  For
the 944T, I run a BPR7ES I think (could be BR7ES, been so long).  Stock
I believe is a "6" plug (NGK is lower=hot, higher=cold).  I didn't notice
any difference really, except that the car idles perhaps a bit rougher
initially.  The plugs are brown when I check them so no problems with
cold fouling or anything, car runs smooth and fast at the track.
