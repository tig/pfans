I have an 87 951 that has had a phantom gas smell since new. After taking
it to the dealer several times, we finally determined that nothing was
wrong. In my car, the smell only occurs when the windows are down and the
sunroof is up or off. Apparently the smell comes from the fuel vent system
(or whatever it's called) and is dragged into the cabin by air currents. It
drives my wife nuts.
