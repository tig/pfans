I have a 1983 924.  I let a mechanic friend sort out the fanbelt amongst
other things a few weeks ago.  As I have mentioned before the belt had begun
to squeal quite badly.  Last wednesday the volts began to drop and then the
engine finally gave up.

Since then the mechanic (use term very loosely here) has tried various belts
and methods.  I found out tonight after he tried to get this belt on that
the tensioner was set at minimum and he had to use a screwdriver to get it
properly on!

Basically can someone tell me either what size the part is or what the
Porsche part number is - the belt I've got is porsche part 900 192 005 50
this guy claims it doesn't fit...

alun

PS At least I solved the squealing problem ;)
