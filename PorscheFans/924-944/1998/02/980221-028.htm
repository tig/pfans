Hi list.

I am trying to adjust the timing belt/balance shaft belt on my '87 951
this weekend and have run into some slight problems.  

1st:  I can find the TDC mark on the dist. cap and the flywheel but I am
unable to see where the mark on the clutch housing is.  It looks like you
look through a hole in the service manual but where is this hole?  Do I
look underneath the engine, on top, on the left or right side???  And
should all three line up perfectly?

2nd:  Next is using the 9201 gauge.  It says to rule out incorrect
displays, line up the drag needle with the gage needle (by ccw rotation) 
after engagement of lockpin.  After I engage the lockpin, wouldn't the
gauge be reading the tension?  Or do I line this up and then, after I
remove the gage, I can tell the tension? 

The belt was orginally changed about 8k ago (not by myself) and I am just
getting to the first adjustment now.  The balance shaft belt is extremely
loose which kinda worries me but to my knowledge the engine is running ok. 
Any information at all would be greatly appreciated.  TIA,

Andrew
