I have a 1991 944S2 and wish to change the shocks to something better
than the stock  Fichtel and Sachs units.  Porsche had the M030 option
for '91, but it involves too much cost in replacement of componentry
after-the-fact to make it worth doing.  There are aftermarket Konis for
the car... models KO-1237 L&R... but they are proving impossible to
find... there was a Porsche option package M474 which was the
predecessor to the M030 and was offered in 1989 only on S2's... and
offered Konis... but no one knows whether these will fit, and it is not
apparent that they are adjustable, or are double-tube gas units that are
externally adjustable as are the KO-1237 aftermarket Koni units... they
may be plain hydraulic units... I did find one supplier who has
Bilsteins, models AK1110 and AK1111 to be used with H&R 250 lb
springs... but Bilstein claims that these shocks are race units and not
really for the street... the vendor, however, disputes this as they say
they have sold dozens of setups like this for the street... I do wonder
how nasty this setup could be for the street after speaking with
Bilstein... I like things firm... but I spend good time in the car and
don't wish to make wearing a mouthpiece while driving standard issue for
using the car for daily transportation!...

This car is my driver... and I wish to improve things from the stock F&S
units... but I don't wish to sacrifice all comfort in the process... I
am not autocrossing this one... do I now wish I had ordered an M030 car
originally?... yes.

SO, I am feeling that I am somewhat hamstrung here in that Porsche
cannot even tell me right now what may fit as they are in the middle of
their move to Atlanta.  I need to change things... but cannot find the
1237 Konis, the M030 componentry from Porsche is really costly as an
after-factory solution, and cannot get appropriate information on the
M474 or Bilstein options I listed above.  Has anyone been through a
similar problem?  And does anyone know whether a '91 S2 can be retrofit
with, say, struts from an '88 or '89 Turbo without problems relative to
clearance of the Brembo brakes or interference with my 17 inch 993 Cup
wheels?  There are such limited offerings for S2's (it seems that after
you get past the 89 Turbos, only Koni has made an effort to make
shocks-- but they are proving impossible to find)... that I wonder if it
may be possible to "get back into the mainstream" of 944 offerings by
fitting Turbo units with new springs.... but the obvious questions are:
1)would clearances be alright?
2)would there be alignment problems?
3)would ride height be problematic?
4)could it be done without replacing steering knuckles or control arms?

If you know of anyone who has gone through this with success, or has
M030 units they wish to sell, knows of KO1237 Koni's that are available,
or has suggestions with the M474 or Bilstein or Turbo setups... I sure
would appreciate a reply outlining their solution and its
success/problems

Thank you.
