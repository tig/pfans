Hey p-fans:
 Had a great weekend drove my 84-944na from Toronto to
Montreal.First time on a long road trip with the car.
The drive is about 600kms each way. 
The car is the most comfortable and confidant thing I've 
ever driven. I have had several Corvetts and they could'nt
even compete. 130kph cruise there,160kph back.
(one massive drunk in between)
Roads were perfect and cd player was great. Strange I did not
see one other Porsche all weekend and the weather was outstanding.
I have been driving my car for almost 6 weeks the weather is cold
but no snow or ice to be seen. 
ATT Will Check your cv shafts that is most likely your culprit
