I think that my computer is back among the living finally.  I wanted to=
 say
thanks to all for solving my a-pillar 3rd screw problem.  Sincere grati=
tude to
George B for explaining where that bugger was.  For those who are inter=
ested,
the third screw on the a-pillar closest to your head is misleading.  Af=
ter
removing the plug, when looking inside the hole, all you see is some ki=
nd of
"screw/bolt" that has a hole drilled through the middle with no way of =
removing
it.  When you look real closely inside the tunnel to get to that screw/=
bolt,
you will notice a very small hole on the right hand side in the vinyl t=
hat
essentially goes straight up vertically into the a-pillar (confusing to=

explain, easy to understand when you are in there).  Shove a phillips h=
ead scre
w driver into that hole and fish around until the head seats on the scr=
ew and
unscrew.  A-pillar removed.  Found a wire in there that went to nowhere=
.
