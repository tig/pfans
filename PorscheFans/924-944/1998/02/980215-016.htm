Tracey, 
    You may try looking at the electrical connector for the Turbocharger
cooling temperature probe. It is located just to the left of the throttle
body. It is a round knurled connector with a wire coming out of the top. If
you get water inside that connector and it becomes grounded, the
turbocharger cooling pump will continue to run. If you haven't had any
trouble with the pump running continuously since then, you may have gotten
it wet and it dried out on its own. Another possibility is that the  pump
timer circuit may be bad. If you want to test the timer circuit, pull the
connector off the temperature probe, take a piece of wire and insert one
end into the connector. Touch the other end of the wire to a ground
somewhere on the car. As soon as the pump starts to run, remove the wire
and start timing the pump run. If it does not stop within 30 seconds, the
timer circuit for the pump is bad. Removing the fuse for the turbocharger
cooling pump causes the timer circuit to drop out. If I remember correctly,
the timer circuit is part of the turbocharger cooling pump relay which
should be relay G19. If the timer circuit is bad, replacing this relay
should correct the problem. Keep us posted on what you find. 

Good Luck,
Clark Fletcher
