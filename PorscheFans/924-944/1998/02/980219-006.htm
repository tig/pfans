Farzaan,

Maybe you should be talking to Roger Penske.  In a recent Autoweek article
they mentioned that the latest Penske car is so slim that Al Unser had to
loose 20 lbs just to fit.  They also mentioned that Andre Ribeiro (I hope
I spelled that right) had no problem due to his smaller size - and while I
don't remember the exact stats they were pretty close to the numbers you
listed for yourself.

I used to be on the small side, but between being on the far side of 40
years old and having a wife who is a gourmet cook (and loves Porsches BTW),
I'm afraid my slender days are behind me.
