*****

European models have two fog lights and two high intensity driving lights.
The driving lights were not highway legal in the U.S. (in California,
anyway) so all we got were the fog lights.  You can get the European-spec
units from Automotion among other places, but they're not cheap at about
$200 a side.  With those units and an H4 upgrade to the main lamps, the car
can have some serious lighting potential.

Has anyone tried to mount a set of one of those aftermarket "globe" lights
(PIAA, etc.) in the space for the driving lights?
