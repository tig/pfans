Additional comments to consider:

>5.  .Any shop that will not guarantee a perfect paint color >match, don't
walk away, run.  With today's technology, a perfect >match is almost a
certainty unless you have a pearl paint job.  >White, black and red are the
hardest colors to match.


Its true that a perfect match is almost a given with todays technology BUT
under the right circumstances.  If your only painting one or two panels on
a car that has seen several years of sun and sitting out in the elements, a
perfect match may never be reached.  Too much oxidation has occurred.  If
your going to be having a vehicle painted with that kind of background and
you want it to look perfect, consider paying the extra to have the whole
car painted.

>10.  MAACO's Imperial Special isn't.
>11.  Earl Schweib's special $199.00 dollar job is worst than MAACO.

Definitely stay away from the "chain" shops such as this.  These places
don't always spend the extra money to send their painters to the latest
classes.

>4.  Talk to local rodders and ask where their work is done.  >These guys
are usually paying over $5,000 for a paint job so >their demands may be
different than yours.

Look at some of these vehicles and you can see the quality or lack thereof
of the person who did it.
