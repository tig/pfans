Hi P-Fans,

The Sekurit is sold by the local dealer here for about $475.00.  But let me
tell you my story involving Safelite....

Back in September, I cought a rock from an overloaded dumptruck that left a
star in the windshield right in the middle of the passenger's side.  I
called State Farm and scheduled a "bulls-eye" repair.  Looked fine but the
crack spread within a week.  I called State Farm back and they set up an
appointment with Safelite to do the work at my home.

Safelite came out, removed the old windshield, and realized the new trim
strip (non-OEM) would not fit.  I came home about this time and spoke with
the installer.  He was going to install the windshield (non-OEM) anyway and
get the factory trim strip to install later.  He put on the ill fitting trim
in the meantime.  It made the windshield appear as if is was not wide
enough, leaving gaps between the "A" pillar and the strip.  Ugly _and_ noisey!

A supervisor was supposed to come out and check the installation the next
day.  My neighbor said a truck pulled up but was gone in seconds.  I called
to ask what the problem was: the supervisor knew nothing about Porsches and
thought it was fine.  Not good enough.

Evidently he returned the following day and installed the factory strip.
There was no difference in fit.  He later called and said the trim strip
would only work with Porsche (Sekurit) windshields and we would have to get
one of those.  The dealer ordered a Sekurit windshield (~$475.00) and trim
strip.  

About 20 days later, the installer  called and asked us to leave the car out
for the installation.  When I got home there was duct tape around the
perimeter of the windshield, new scars on my interior rearview mirror, and a
completed work order on the driver's seat.  I pulled the car into the garage
for the night, thinking the work was satisfactory.  The next day, I pulled
the duct tape off and found the fit to be even worse than the first attempt.

I called Safelite to find out what the problem was.  They believed that the
Porsche dealer had sold them the wrong windshield.  They wanted me to drive
the car out to the dealer so that he could look at the car.  I went the
following day and spoke to the parts manager and we were on the phone to
Reno in short order.  They were not able to rule out a mistake on their
part.  Namely, that the w/s was incorrectly packaged.  They agreed to order
another, if Safelite would save the w/s so they could verify a mistake on
their own part or on Safelite's.  But Safelite would not agree to pay for
another w/s in any event.   By this point in time the new w/s had begun to
crack in the lower left corner.

I called the dealer to find out who did their glass work and scheduled the
work with them.  At this point I do not think Safelite had been paid by
State Farm and they were pissed that they weren't getting to complete the
job (Thumbs down1).  The dealer ordered the part, still willing to make good
if it turned out to be their mistake (Thumbs up!).  The dealer double
checked the parts fiche to verify that we were getting the correct w/s.
There are actually only 2 available for the 90 944 S2 Coupe: Sekurit and and
M467 option called Sekuriflex with the later costing in the $1700 range and
having an inner laminate of plastic or something.

About 2 weeks later we scheduled the installation.  I was going to be there
from start to finish.  Two trucks and  three installers came out.  They
pointed out the crack and immediately knew what the problem was:  the
clueless Safelite boys had not been removing all of the old w/s's material
from the recessed grove in the body around the w/s.  Every w/s installed was
higher out of the groove than the previous.  The reason the last had cracked
was that the hood would hit it when opened.  They spent about 2 hours
cleaning the channel out then priming, and sealing it.  They fit the trim
and then installed the w/s to a perfect fit.  All without duct tape!
Customer statisfied.  The major caveat would be to be sure they have P-car
experience and have customer references to support that.

Needless to say, Safelite will get no more of my business.  I've already
scheduled another replacement for another car with Raleigh Glass and Mirror.
Safelite ended up eating 2 w/s's and 3 trim strips.  They will likely never
sell another w/s to a PCA member in this area.  I guess what pissed me off
the most was their attitude on the 2nd w/s and possibly their condescending
nature at every communication.

Got it off my chest!
