To those interested,
  While waiting for my tires to be mounted last year at an auto shop, I read 
an article on paint-less dent repair in a magazine for 4-wheel drive trucks. 
It described how to create the tools, and how to use them. The tools were 
simply steel rods that on one end had been heated and hammered into a smooth 
spoon shape, then annealed. Various lengths with bends were suggested to reach 
difficult spots inside doors, fenders, etc... With the proper tool in hand, 
the spoon shaped end was rubbed in a circular motion from the back side of the 
dent (requires removal of the door panel, etc..). The massaging motion 
described was spiral in nature, but I do not recall if it started in the 
center of the dent, or the perimeter. It suggested working slowly so as not to 
push the dent out too far. I would imagine that rubbing even a smooth piece of 
metal on the interior of a door panel or hood would take some amount of paint 
off. Perhaps a piece of tape could be used on the interior surface of the 
panel in question to protect the paint, but I don't know what the 
"professionals" do.. It didn't appear to be all that difficult. The article 
suggested re-creating the dent if it was pushed out too far, and then trying 
again. Someday I will give it a try.. Perhaps if you are armed at least with 
the above rudimentary understanding of the procedure, a "professional" will be 
more willing to let you watch, or participate in the repair. There is no BIG 
secret as to the technique....

Good Luck!

Ezra
