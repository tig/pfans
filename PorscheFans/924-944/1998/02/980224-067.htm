>The interesting thread on welders begs for my two cents:


I'll add another two cents.
I've had my 110v Mig for almost 15 years (I forget the name brand and I
removed the print on the side when cleaning it with thinner!). I brought it
for $250 +/- and it has served me faithfully ever since. These things are
indispensable. I have made special tools in minutes (last ones were a
sprocket holder for belt changes and a trans drain plug removal tool).
It really doesn't take long to learn and then you can weld all sorts of
things. Great tool for removing broken bolts and stripped screw heads.
If you really need to weld metal plate over 1/4" thick it won't work, but I
don't believe I had any plate metal that thick on my car.
It sits in my shop next to the body leading tools...but thats another story!
