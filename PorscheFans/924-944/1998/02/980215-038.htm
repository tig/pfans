The description in the Haynes manual is pretty good for CV joints.  I also
used a great FAQ on CV's (?? search for CV Joints and FAQ) but the main thing
it said was to carefully clean the old grease and replace it with new.  It
also you can swap left to right on CV joints as long s as you keep the inside
joint on the inside (and outers as outers).  One of my CV;s was clicking
pretty bad.  Found damaged inner race on both sides.  Cleaned and greased
them, and swapped sides.  Worked!  No noise, runs fine.  Don't think it will
last long, but saved some bucks for a while.

Servicing the CV's is an easy job.  The ring clip on the axle end is a bitch
without a spreader tool.  Made mine by grinding a pointed end ring clip tool
to have flat ends.
