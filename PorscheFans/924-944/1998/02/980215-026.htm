I test drove an 88 version yesterday and would like to know whether the following behaviour is normal: the car accelerated powerfully in 2nd gear until at a high engine speed the power suddenly cut, or at least levelled out suddenly.

No the car should not cut out or "level out". This is assuming you were
shifting in the right range. In 2nd gear red line comes up quick once
boost is on. The true test with any boost measurment is to wait until at
least
4th gear. Completely open the throttle, if the car cuts out you
definately have a boost related problem. 

> This happened twice whilst I was test driving but the whole thing was so quick that I didn't get a good feel for what was going on. Is there a rev-limiter or a turbo waste-gate cutting it at some point or is it likely to be a fault on the car?

Yes the dme cuts out fuel if it senses an overboost situation. This may
or may not be serious, it could be something as simple as a vaccum line
dangling.
If after re testing in 4th gear it still cuts out you will need to check
out the problem before buying.
