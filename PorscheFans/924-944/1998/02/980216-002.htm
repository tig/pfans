Hi PFans,

Recently, my 87 951 developed a 'fluttering' boost problem which gradually got worse.  At first, it would sometimes just lose a little boost under WOT--maybe dropping to 1.6 or 1.7 (vs. 2.0), but for the past two weeks it has been pretty much stuck at 1.2 on the gauge.  I've been through this enough to know where all the vacuum lines are, so I was really puzzled on this one.  The strangest thing is that if I drove very carefully after first starting the car cold, making sure to keep the boost needle below 1.0 on the gauge, then I would eventually be able to get the car to boost one time (one gear) before dropping back to the default mode.  I ended up replacing the "turbo timed valve" on the advice of SCCA/PCA 951 racer Rob Clark.  I also replaced the all the rubber hoses which connect directly to this valve:  wastegate line, the boost line, and one other which connects up to that metal mass of lines under the manifold.  The result is that the car now makes full boost again--maybe better than it has in quite a while, which is probably due to the old "timed" valve gradually failing.  As an aside, my local dealership only had a part number for the valve-to-wastegate line, saying they would have to sell me the other two already attached to that mass of metal lines.  Ouch.  I ended up using some fuel lines intended for a carbureted car, but I worry that they may not be able to take 15 psi of pressure.  Looking back, maybe I should have just ordered an extra valve-to-wastegate hoses and used that.
