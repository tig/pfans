My opinion of women like that is "Get a Life!"

I think thats probably because most women couldn't tell you what a Porsche
looks like unless its a 911.  Thats the only Porsche "image" thats been
burnt into their clueless brains through movies.  Besides how many Porsche
commercials have you seen versus Camaro?  I would say more women could
identify a Camaro before they could a Porsche.

>I think that most girls just dont " get " the car.

This is probably true.  Most girls don't "get" any car.

>    I do notice that almost half the Porsches I see are driven by women,

I have to disagree with you on this.  At least where I live, I haven't seen
any other female driving a Porsche.  That's not to say that there aren't
any, I just haven't seen them.

Just a humble opinion from one of the few females on the list.
