Hi,

Still not feeling too hot.  Went to see the insurance company.  As usual,
they treated me quite well (this company is known for being jerks) and 
processed everything like a good company should.  The only bad part is,
to do a proper job, they WILL have to re-paint the door because of the
damage from prying at the window frame (it yanked up the rail under it
a slight bit).

I hate painting parts of cars, especially red cars, but oh well, at least
some scum is enjoying my radio right now.

THe total repair cost will likely fall around C$1500-2000 or so once all
is said and done.  Ridiculous, all for a $200 CD player.  I'm also out of
pocket $100 for a deductible.

Anyhow, enough crying from me.  My local shop has a great price on LSD
transaxles for the 951.  The price is C$1700 + shipping.  You can go
to their website at http://www.weissach.com or email them at
parts@weissach.com or call them at (604)738-3911, ask for Asgar, pronounced
as it is spelled.  The C$1700 works out to around US$1200 with the current
exchange rate.  They bought out some stores inventory or something and they
had a few of these units laying around.

Make sure you say I sent you because I think this is a special price.  He
told me to let my friends know, I don't think he expected me to tell 1800
of them :)

I took a look at the control arms going in.  Wierd is all I really have to
say.  One side is the normal Turbo S part.  The other side is a 944 part
number with obviously re-enforced areas and a different ball joint.  They
showed me the document from Germany that says they will continue to use the
one side 951 part number until they run out, then both will be 944 part
numbers.  Both arms had the same bushing in them.  The 944 part number is
manufactured in 1997, the 951 part was manufactured in 1988!

I don't know if the above is supposed to be that way, but I'm so fed up
right now with bad luck, I don't want to even know if it's wrong.  As long
as I can drive my car again, I'll be fine.

Farzaan.
