Hi P-fans,

Well, I was real worried after some of the list members' warnings about the
bad fuel pressure regulator:  "Don't Drive It!"    Against better judgment,
I went for a spirited drive.  I pushed it hard.  No hasitation, no black
smoke, no problems...no gasoline smell.  I don't get it.  My machanic said
I have a bad FPR, that the "diaphram has failed," and that's where the
gasoline smell came from.  

I do smell gasoline smell sometimes, which was why I took it in.  After
better grounding the engine block, the irratic temp. has gone away (in
tonight's drive anyway).  Can someone tell me, is it possible for the FPR
diaphram to have failed and I still drive hard like that?  Please help, I'm
sick of almost spending money to fix something not broken, like my radiator
that isn't leaking at all, but was diagnosed "cracked."  

Thanks for any reassurance on this matter,
-tony
