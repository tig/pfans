I dunno.....seems to me that the lower center pod that currently does
not contain any bulb receptacle in it is what they are refering to. That
one is actually used as simply a reflector in the US only market. In my
MB 450SEL, the long wheel base sedan, they use the pod w/ the reflector
as the standard running marker lamp and another pod containing a
receptacle for a higher wattage bulb.....more like a 15W versus a 5W
bulb. Now, it is interesting after studying the schematic on pg 209 of
the Haynes 944 manual (sometimes it's helpful, other times it don't know
Diddley!), it seems to me that one lead goes to the common ground. The
other side is shown as a hash-marked line w/ the wire color code of
Grey/White. This probably means that the wire is all Grey w/ a White
stripe running down its length. Both the left assembly and the right
assembly shows the Grey/White wires joining to the bus at the right
middle of the page. I'm gonna assume (don't say it!!!) that it would be
the left lamp bus. What this bus looks like, I'm not sure but I'll try
to find out because I want to hook up these empty pods too and make
these buggers work. I, too, want rear  lamps instead of extensions of
the standard running lamps, like that kit Performance Products is
selling on pg 38 in the left hand upper corner quoted as  "rear light
update" kit, item A. priced at US$23.95 excluding s/h costs. Anyway,
sorry for digressing...... the Grey/White wire wanders off to what the
book labels as a rear foglight relay. Another Grey/White wire is also
coming off of the same relay but shares power w/ the front fog light
relay. Another wire shown as Gr/bu (Grey or Green/blue my guess) shows
leading off to the rear window defogger switch on the right bottom of pg
212. I think this should be significant to the operation of the rear fog
lights. What do you think? Oh, I have to remember that you are speaking
for your 944 which you are referring to the schematics for 85 and newer.
I'm gonna be digging in the 83 only schematics, pgs 198 thru 202. I'll
continue in my quest for bright reds. Let me know what you come up with
and I'll do the same.
