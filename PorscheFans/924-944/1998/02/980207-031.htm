One thing for sure: it's going to have to come apart again.  No way around it.  Once 
inside then the mechanic may find anything from grease on the disc facing to a bent 
driveshaft from the rebuild.  Maybe the bolts holding the pressure plate to the flywheel 
were incorrectly torqued and pulled in two (Did that one myself!).  Maybe the pilot 
bearing was defective.  Maybe the diaphragm spring of the pressure plate broke.  Maybe 
some of the facing came off of the driven disc.  It could be anything and it may or may 
not be anyone's fault.  These things happen.

Bite the bullet and get it fixed because it ain't going to get better by itself.

Good luck,
