P-fans:

I don't think that there is any real mystery about 968 prices.  Although it is
true that the differences between model years are not profound, the market
reflects a large premium for later model years and low mileage.  Cabrios
always cost at least $5k more than corresponding coupes.  So a 95 cabrio with
10k miles will cost in the high thirties, while a 92 coupe with 80k miles will
cost $17-18k.  I think what confused some people is that Lee's 93 coupe cost
only $17,500 or so (I think he said).  But this car had over 90k miles and was
a 93, so it was relatively cheaper.

I paid $20k for for a 92 coupe with 49k miles, and $33,650 for a 92 cabrio
with 3k miles in the same year.  No mystery, just very different levels of
desirability.  And I can tell you that my wife and I get lots of stares and
thumbs up when we drive the cabrio, but few even notice us in the coupe.  So
why does she get to drive the cabrio, while I get the coupe?....
