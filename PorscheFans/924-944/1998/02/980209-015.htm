The 944 Turbo Cabriolet was produced as part of a special run in the first
half of 1991. There were approximately 525 of them built with about 255
exported outside Germany. The Turbo Cab is of the Turbo S layout. However,
the performance numbers are slightly less than the Turbo S. This comes from
the extra 110 lbs. of weight added to the Cab to stiffen the body.  The
information I have indicates that the Turbo Cabriolet does use firmer
suspension components that were intentionally not used on the S2.  This
leads me to believe that the S2 did not receive the same amount of body
stiffening as the Turbo Cabriolet. The only information I have about Turbo
Cabriolets exports indicate that none were imported to the US. I have heard
rumors that some did make it to Canada. Perhaps someone else has some
additional export information.
