Hi P-Fans,

My leaking windshield seal project has mushroomed into dashboard/headliner
as-long-as-you're-in-there-syndrome.  The cost, originally $75, has now
exceeded $765.00.  OUCH!  Another money spending opportunity reared its
ugly head when a friend suggested I have the windows tinted to help the car
stay cooler in the summer.  Well, as long as the glass is out....

So my questions are:

1:  What should I expect to pay?  You are all aware of the cash register
sounds in vendors' minds 	when the word Porsche is mentioned, of course.
Keep in mind that the glass is out of the 	car.  Ought to be pretty easy
(read cheaper), right?

2:  There are many films available.  Does anyone have specific
recommendations (or warnings!) to 	offer?  One of the ads touted their "All
Metal" films with lifetime guarantee.  Would the metal 	films increase my
car's radar return strength or decrease the range of my radar detector?

3:  I'm not looking for the "Drug Dealer LimoTint", but rather a lighter
shade to compliment my Slate 	Blue Metallic paint.  Will I sacrifice heat
rejection by going with a lighter shade?  North  	Carolina has a law
limiting the degree of tinting and I would just as soon they didn't get too
	interested in any of my vehicles during an inspection.

As always, thanks in advance for all replies,

-Bill
