Cabriolet Owners,

I wanted to take my 944S2 Cab. to play at Driver's Ed events,
which require a roll bar.  Installation of a standard bolt-in
bar is complicated by the Cab's double floor-pan.  I finally
had a local custom bar/cage manufacturer do the following for
installing an Autopower bar, and I'm posting it if other Cab.
owners are considering a roll bar

1.  Cut square holes in the top floor pan the same size as
the bar's hoop mounting plates.

2.  Measure the depth between the floor pans, and cut a piece
of steel stock of the proper thickness to act as a spacer.

3.  Weld the spacer and the cut-out floor piece back into the floor.

4.  Drill mounting holes and mount the bar as usual.

Sounds a bit scary, but the bar will be removable and it's
as sturdy as possible.  The car feels incrementally bit
stiffer. Also pretty cheap - about $100 to do the work.  I
view this as far superior to a custom bar that bolts to the
seat-belt mounting points -- which is probably suicidal
if the car really turns over. My bar has a removable cross
brace  and harness brace, convenient for using the back
seat when not going to the track.

The only problem left is the rear interior trim pieces.
Since the roll bar braces mount well to the outside of the
wheel wells, the trim pieces that usually cover the rear
speakers and the tops raising/lowering transmission
don't fit (unless I take the bar out). I'll look into
getting custom-fitted trim pieces.

TKL
90 944 S2 -- track ready now.
