Just a note.  I've been using Autoglym products for six years now, but
am slowly changing to other products.  Autoglym Super Resing Polish works
very well, the Extra Gloss Protection is like adding depth to your paint,
worked wonders on a heavily scratched 951 hood recently.  So why change?
For some reason, the product quality has been going down.  The Leather
Care Cream used to work very well, leaving a very nice dull, but rich
finish.  The new stuff leaves a "Armoral" like finish which dries in
different stages, so you get ugly shiny and dull spots all over the car.
The car shampoo also seems to be more "consumer" now, with less cleaning
power.

Paul and I have found that on a black car, Meguiars High Tech Wash works
better as it seems to smear the hairline swirls so you can't see them,
but on the my red car, the Autoglym Car Shampoo seems to work better where
hairline swirl marks cannot be seen anyways.

An interesting product I picked up recently that works really well is
Meguiars Plastic Polish.  I used it on my speedo/tach console and it
made all the scratchy marks disapear completely, pretty neat stuff.
Autoglym's Window Polish also works really well.

For reference, this is what I use on my car:
Wash     Autoglym Car Shampoo
Clean    Autoglym Super Resin Polish (only if necessary)
Protect  Meguiars #26 Yellow Wax
Interior Looking for something better than Autoglym Leather Care Cream
Wheels   Autoglym Car Shampoo and wax with Super Resing Polish

If my car gets to the point where there are lots of hairline scratches,
I'd use Extra Gloss Protection along the line somewhere just for the
oils.
