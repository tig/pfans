Hi P-Fans,
                I recently flushed and changed my
radiator coolant and have some questions.  When I 
drained the system I only unpluged the radiator plug
and not the engine block, was this alright?  Also do I 
have to re-bleed the system every time I add coolant?
Finally, it feels like the car is driving better with the
new coolant, would that be related to the change?  
This was the first project that I did at my high school
shop, it is a very nice garage with four lifts.  I hope to
soon put in new motor mounts.  Are these worth the trouble
of installing and can a novice put them in with help from
an experienced shop teacher.  TIA.
