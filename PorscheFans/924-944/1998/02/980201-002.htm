Tom,
   Good catch. I went back and looked at the article again. For everyone's
benefit, the 1987 944 Turbo the 5th gear should be .829 instead of .089.
That was a misprint on my part. Also, the 4th gear should have been 1.034
instead of .034. That was actually a misprint in the article. The overall
gear ratios for those two misprints is correct. Sorry about that. Once
again good catch by Tom.

Clark,

Thanks for the info.

>1987 944 Turbo (Final Drive 3.375 : 1)
>1st  Gear:		3.500 			13.61 : 1			  40 MPH
>2nd Gear:		2.059			  9.94 : 1			  68 MPH

>4th Gear:		  .034			  3.48 : 1			132 MPH
>5th Gear:		  .089			  2.79 : 1			152 MPH

Couple of typos above... 4th is 1.034 and 5th is 0.829, just the same as
the 944S below.

These results don't make sense.  The S2 can't go faster than the 968 in
2nd and 3rd if it has a higher overall ratio.  At a redline of 6500 rpm
for my S2 I compute speeds in gears of 35, 60, 88, 120, and 159 (not
obtainable).  As you can see in 3rd gear the overall ratio for the S2 and
968 are nearly the same, but the quoted speeds are 10 mph different.
