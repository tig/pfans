Dynamic European Technologies----i had mine rebuilt there during the 
whole UPS strike (bas**rd union workers) so it had been 3 weeks so i 
went down there to teach a course on the internet and was about 3 
blocks away...long story short it is a nice little place there work 
was exceptional and the people were nice..in addition if you want 
they will give you your arm back meaning if you were careful you wont 
need an alignment...they are on gulfton st. if you are from 
houston...oh yeah if you tell them you are with PCA they will do it 
for 119$ or at least they would 4 months ago...everyone ready for the 
big race a TWS on the 22nd???
