With all this talk about:


>Carb venturis giving way to manifold pressure-based systems, which
gave way to air mass-based systems.  Both the air flow meter and the
hot-wire sensor fall into the latter category.<<


and

I was just going thru Porsche Fact Books for '92, '93, '94, & '95, and
under "Fuel Supply", the '95 968 lists (and, I quote):

	Electronic

	Multi-point Fuel Injected (earlier books just say "Fuel Injected)

	DME Controlled

and, here is where the '95 contains an additional line of print

	<bold>HOT WIRE AIR MASS SENSOR</bold> 


Not that any of this means a whole lot to me, but I thought that some
of you might be interested.

so far)
