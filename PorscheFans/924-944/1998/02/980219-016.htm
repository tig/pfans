I've tried double-clutch shifting and when I do it right, it makes shifts=
 very smooth and you can tell that syncros aren't necessary, but in the h=
eat of battle, I don't do it as well and I just heel-toe downshift. I fig=
ure I bought the stinking syncros, I might as well use them.  :-)     I d=
on't really "heel and toe" to downshift I use my toe on the brake and kin=
d of roll my
ankle over to the gas, it works well for me. Basically, I'm using my big =
toe on the brake and the side of my foot for the gas.

u need to 'double declutch'. (at least thats what I know it as) Using the=
 heel toe methods described in the earlier postings you use the syncros t=
o bring the drive shaft up to the transmission RPM. The rev matching that=
 the driver is attempting to accomplish takes place at the flywheel / clu=
tch interface.

ch. As mentioned earlier this is tough to do perfectly and errors can res=
ult in $$damage$$. This is actually quite common in purpose built race ca=
rs that use transmissions affectionately called 'crash boxes'.
