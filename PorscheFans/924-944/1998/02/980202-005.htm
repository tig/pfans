Hi Lee,

Can't give you any advice on the CO tester, except possibly to talk to SnapOn.
As far as the torque wrench is concerned, I believe Sears has a
re-calibration service for them, if that seems to be the problem.  Also, in
case you or anyone else isn't aware, after using a torque wrench, you
should always reset it to 0.  I have used one Craftsman 1/2 drive
"click-type" torque wrench for the past 5-6 years on my wheels and,
following the above resetting procedure, it has maintained its accuracy +/-
1ft-lb.  BTW, I also store it in a canvas bag with the corresponding
extension and socket.  FWIW.
