I cannot agree more.  When I told my friends that I had bought a 944, their
first reaction was how expensive it was going to be to maintain.  They
politely reminded me how much I complained about maintenance prices for
previous car which was a 91 Capri Convertible (Mercury import from Austraila).

I was so happy to show them my maintenance records for a full year of
ownership on the 944 vs. a full year of ownership on the Capri.  I included
gas, oil changes, belt changes, insurance, and anything that pertained to
keeping the car on the road.  There was a $200 difference.  To my surprise,
the 944 was cheaper.  During the past year the 944 got new oil cooler
seals, DME unit, timing belt, water pump, and all the stuff normally
recommended when doing the belt and pump.  The Capri got a new headlight
motor, power window motor, and convertible top.

At least with the 944, even though things may be expensive, I can usually
get them the same or next day.  With the Capri, everything was always a
special order or dealer item.

Just my experience,
