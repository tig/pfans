Seems like the starving masses accepted the 944 better than the 928,
perhaps this was because of the lower price. Is the 944 or a 928
considered a true Porsche? We all know only the 911 is a real
Porsche......Just kidding!! No flames!!

Bill,

I agree. I truly enjoy being able to buy the 944/951's at what I think
are incredible prices for the amount of car you get..hell I wish 911's
devalued as well so I could have a few of those. I wouldn't mind a 928
either!
