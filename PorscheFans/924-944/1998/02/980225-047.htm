Clark and other P-fans,

I have an '86 944 and had the fron aligned at an NTB in Houston for about $95.

The shop I went to had an expensive computerized alignment setup.  This
system had a CD-ROM complete with beautiful diagrams of exactly which screw
had to be loosened in order to adjust things.  

The diagrams really were excellent; showed the technician precisely what to
do.  I felt like it was an idiot-proof process.  I have little knowledge
about how to do an alignment, but I could have done it by following the
on-screen directions given by that machine.  

I have had no problems with the alignment (about 8 weeks ago.)  The price
was right too!

Hope this helps
