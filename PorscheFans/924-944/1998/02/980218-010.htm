My 1988 951 has 116,000 mostly highway miles on it and was dinged in
the left front with minor frame damage over a year ago (and repaired).
 I recently put adjustable Koni shocks in the front and non-adjustable
Konis in the rear (the car had needed shocks for some time).  In
addition, I run 16" R1s (225/50F and 245/45R) on the street full time.

The problem is that the car's ride is terrible, even with the front
shocks on full soft.  Specifically, the car jounces over anything
except smooth pavement and hops through bumpy corners.  What could be
causing such a horrible ride (I have been in three 951s with similar
stock suspensions and the ride was nowhere as bad)?  I plan on
checking the upper strut bearings as well as replacing the control
arms shortly.  Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!
