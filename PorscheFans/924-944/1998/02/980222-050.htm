thought what a better place to ask questions than my friends here on this=

post. What I am looking for is a small welder for home use in my shop. No=
w,
I call this a shop when in fact its really my garage. I want something th=
at
will work off of 110 volt household current. I find two that interest me
but I am unsure of what the difference really is. Look at page 100 of the=

Sears tool catalog and you will find two styles that I am interested in
purchasing.
1) Mig welder (item A)
2) Gasless wire feed welder (item B)
For general purpose welding ... ?
a) Mig welder will do more types of welding?
b) Gasless is just about the same as a Mig welder?
c) Which has more flexibility around the shop?
d) Which is easier to work with?<

John,

If you want to know about welding, sign up for a welding class at adult
education or your community college.  Once you learn about welding, you
will probably decide neither of these welders is what you want.  The 110
does not give you enough amps to do thick metal.  My experience with the
110 units is that they are only ok to stick together a broken handle on
your lawn mower or weld an exhaust bracket.  Anything that is critical or=

heavy like cars, axles, trailers, frames, etc. should be welded with a 22=
0
machine.

The MIG (metal inert gas) is a wire welder that uses an inert gas as an
oxygen barrier.  The preferred gas is argon, it is heavy and stays where
you are welding.  The welding wire is on a coil and is fed by the machine=
=2E =

A good  220 MIG welder is the fastest welding machine, produces an
excellent weld and is the easiest to use.  You can produce good welds wit=
h
the shortest amount of practice.  The MIG can weld all positions,
horizontal, vertical and overhead.  You can weld both thin and thick meta=
l.
 If you are good enough, you can weld sheet metal on cars. The MIG machin=
e
is more of a production rather than a shop machine (unless you are buildi=
ng
a trailer or other large project).

The wire welder (gasless) is simular to the MIG but uses a flux core
welding wire.  The flux core produces an atmosphere that holds away the
oxygen.  The welds are not as good as those from a MIG machine and it is
easier to burn holes in thin metal.  This machine is marketed for the hom=
e
market.  Its value is questionable IMHO.

For basic shop use a 220 arc welder would be my choice.  Using 6011 rod y=
ou
can weld in all positions and on dirty metal.The welds are almost as nice=

as a MIG weld.  Arc welding requires a lot of practice and is harder to d=
o
than MIG.

Most of the time you have to cut the metal before you weld it.  Your
hacksaw is not the trick tool for cutting anything you want to weld.  If
you are buying a welder, you will need an oxy/acetylene cutting torch and=

gas welder.  You can weld thin metals with the gas torch. You can learn t=
o
use the cutting torch in a short period of time but the gas welding
requires a good deal of practice.

For the price of a MIG machine, you can buy an arc welder and oxy/acetyle=
ne
outfit.  Or if you have the bucks, buy a 220 MIG and oxy/acetylene torch.=
 =

Your garage probably has 220 for a dryer.  You can use this to run your
welder.  Once you learn to weld, you will wonder how you managed without
it.
