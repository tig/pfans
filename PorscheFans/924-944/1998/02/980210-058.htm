I noticed the tire prices for D40M2's listed and I'll suggest to anyone
that RE71's are far better and just about the same price mail order. I got
my set a few months ago and they just keep getting better. It's been
raining cats and dogs lately and I've yet to get them to slide or
hydroplane. They come with very deep grooves compared to most tires, and
when new, I noticed some sqirminess, but as they wear in, they keep
improving their grip. Wear seems to be very good despite their low
treadwear rating. Prices at Tire Rack for my sizes:
225/50-16.......112
245/45-16.......119
My 2 percent of a dollar.
