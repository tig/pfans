From reading the posts on copying manuals to CD's, it seems to me that a
simpler idea than doing the whole manual on CD ROM is to just copy from the
3-ring binder manaul a few pages and mail or fax them to the needy party.
Said needy party could rely on the Haynes manual the rest of the time, or
the microfiche if he has access to a reader, which I do if I drive 20
minutes to the library.

One post says that the manual has pictures that are great. I guess the fiche
does not? I understand the fiche is all black and white and some wiring
diagrams are in color. But surely not many of the photos in the manual are
color? Are all the photos actually present in the fiche, just a few not in
color?

I am trying to get together enough information to attempt the checking, now,
and in a year, the replacement of belts. The Haynes manual is virtually
silent on this, saying only to take it to a dealer with the tool. How many
pages in the manual are there on this subject? Would somebody be willing to
copy and mail or fax those pages to me? If not, would somebody tell me if
the pages on this topic are equally well covered on the fiche? Are the
photos all there in the fiche? I am willing to buy the fiche, but I have not
found a printer for the fiche yet.

By the way, I spoke to a mechanic in Honolulu who says that changing the
belts is not all there is to the job. It may well be that idlers and
sprockets need to be replaced. They should be removed and spun by hand, and
if not completely smooth turning, they should be replaced, at maybe $30 each
for the bad ones only.

Regarding scanning. My son in Baltimore is an imaging, etc., consultant and
knows many installations where 120 page per minute paper page scanners are
in use in or near DC, some of them do both sides of the page at once (front
and back). At that rate a 240 page paper manual is only 2 minutes to scan at
readable resolution where handwriting must be viewable and readable. I
believe it is not unusual to scan them to a CD for shipment to a remote
location for cheap keying in of data to go with the images. So it must be
that some service bureaus have this equipment, too. For hire. (They
sometimes ship stuff offshore for keying). The copyright is still a problem.
But I don't think the copyright would prevent the owner of the fiche from
printing a manual for his own use, at least not the one he owns, since he
has already paid for the material. I'll ask my son if he knows of any that
can also copy fiche to CD, and give you an update. Maybe the cost would be
lower if many fiche owners all asked for the same CD, since only one scan
would be made and many CD's. If this works, we can seek permission from the
fiche sales outlet or Porsche, and I think we would have to be given it. How
could they say no? We might place a lot of orders for fiche if they say yes,
although the more expensive paper manual sales might decline.
