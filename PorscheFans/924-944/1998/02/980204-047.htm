Some people have been inquiring about MAF conversion on the 951, and I
have one, so here are my answers...


> 
> How long have you run MAF on your car?

  Since the beginning- mine was the original APE beta test vehicle and
the one that the dyno runs describe.


> Have you had any problems?

  No, not really.  Sometimes wish that the cold running map was a little
leaner but only occassionally.

> Did you notice power increase

  Yes, you really feel it, not just on a dyno sheet.

>better throttle response

  very good throttle response, probably the best of any engine I've ever
driven.  Much of this has to do with just being a well designed engine,
but the MAF probably helped some.

>torque increase after installation?

  There is a quantitative increase in torque, pretty much everywhere.
The cars have a different feel than the stage 2 chips from APE that the
car used to have.  The car feels more like a highly tuned
normally-aspirated car. Another way of saying this is that the power
curve has shifted up in RPM, something not too surprising, given the
type of modification this is.

> What are your car specs? (stock, K27,test pipe, ported head,

  Entirely stock except for the MAF

> stroker)
> Would you recommend the MAF kit after your experience ?

  Yes, especially for those who want more power than the chips.  Porsche
HP is never cheap but this is surely some of the cheapest power on a
951.  It also mirrors the newer cars in that it is technology that the
factory later themselves added.  The actual mass-flow sensor is quite
large (77mm?) and will probaly flow to 400-500 HP as it normally is sold
in the aftermarket as a hopup for 5.0 Rustangs.


> Anybody has comparable DYNO results?

  Powerhaus sells the APE kit with a K27 and modified chips and claims
good power. I don't really know what the dyno numbers are for them. APE
claims 310HP for the small turbo (86-87) cars and 330 for the S models. 
Interestingly, race gas nets about 10-20 more HP, according to their
dyno tests.


From another post:

  Why?

  Mine is *very* tractable and there are no problems of which I am aware
of cool vs hot air.  APE actually "paints" the K&N they provide with a
plastic paint to reduce hot air intake from the top of the filter.  If
you were really concerned about the air source, you could extend the
filter farther out and lower but there is very little room.  One
alternativce for track cars is to lose the headlight opening and draw
air in from there.

  One final note: my 87 951 had around 90K on it when the AMF went on. 
It has over 130K now and the engine still has the original head gasket. 
The car has basically been like most 951s that are maintained: pretty
reliable but expensive when anything (even regular wear items like
clutches) need to be replaced.  I wondered about the sensibility of
adding so much power to an already "experienced" engine but so far it
has been the paragon of reliability (for a Porsche..).  Just goes to
show that even the turbo cars have a lot of engineering headroom right
from the factory.
