I'm sure it would be quite an endeavor, but there are a few ways this can be
done .. 1 would be pdf files (acrobat reader) .. the other would be HTML ..
where the manuel can be recreated using straight text and scanned images for
the illistrations. this can be easily done... I would be more than happy to
create such a program(s) out of the 944 manuels have it cut into cdroms and
make them available to the list for the cost of the blank cd's (approx $20
each) .. the only problem I can see would be with copyrights and such ..
