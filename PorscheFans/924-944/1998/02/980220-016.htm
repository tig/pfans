<Get on the soapbox>

Wow, I probably should not be surprised at the lack of knowledge this
article displays, but still, it is offensive.  

So the 914/4 was the only Porsche car with chronic corrosion problems and
mechanical problems?  Hmm, let's get a bunch of 73 911 Targas with the
doors open, the top off and have someone jump in the cars and see how many
fold in half.  Or even better let's check the plugs of an early 911 for
fouling.  Or like you can find a 74-77 911 that will not self-destruct if
you do not change the fan blade, add the oil cooler, etc. Yeah right.  And
the 924 was the only Porsche with an Audi involvement?  Hmm, everyone who
has seen the Audi logo stamped on the body parts of their 944 raise their
mouse.  I am surprised the article did not say the new Boxsters built in
Scandinavia are not true Porsches (they are not built in Zuffenhausen
after all).

It is a sad article.  I cannot wait till I get off work to drive my sorry
not-true-Porsche Neckarsulum-built 944 Turbo and whip the air-cooled rear
end of some throughbred Porsche. 

<Off the soapbox>

Note 1: I hope my use of the Rev Limiter clause does not offend.
Note 2: I have nothing against the 911, it will bring grins to my face,
too.
