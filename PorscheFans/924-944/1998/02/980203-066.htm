Zdeslaw;

I read a few years ago a comprehensive story in a US magazine called =
"European Car" about performance upgrades for a 1980 US 924, 115 hp (0r =
110 depending on who you ask) version. 

If I can find the magazine I will send you more details but as I recall =
the story, the "easy" modifications, throttle body, air filter, exhaust =
yielded essentially zero performance increase. The authors had access to =
an engine dynamometer so this was hard fact, not opinion.

Only when "Big Valve" head, higher lift cam, two twin throat weber carbs, =
special manifolds and headers were installed was performance measurably =
increased. Actually, the result was quite good, money aside, but all this =
stuff cost something like 3500 USD for parts, to say nothing of the =
labor. 

These engines were not designed by the Trabant people, the inexpensive =
performance enhancements are already done by the factory. If you really =
want more performance, remember that old American expression; "speed =
costs money, how fast do you want to go?"

Best regards,

John R .Asp
