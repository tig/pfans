Am I missing something here?  If the clutch is IN all the time during the
downshift, there is no way you will be able to downshift with no synchro
action.  The transmission will still have to speed-up the input shaft for
proper gear meshing.  The only way to downshift without syncro action is
to double clutch, i.e., release the clutch as you downshift while passing
through neutral.  THEN you blip the throttle appropriately to bring the
trans input shaft up to speed.  Then you put the clutch IN again and
finish the shift.  Admittedly, this is a lot more work and harder to do.
Since I have not driven my car on the track yet, maybe it's not necessary
to do it that way, but it's the only way that makes sense to me.

Ah... the noise.  Hearing those McClaren BMW GT-1s downshifting at Laguna
Seca was *quite* a thrill.  Almost as much as hearing them under full
throttle :-)  Wow!
