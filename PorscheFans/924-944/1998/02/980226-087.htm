Not complicated, but you have to be sure to take the necessary
measurements before you drop the torsion tube.

I don't know what the total range is but on US cars the adjuster
can be used to lower the rear of the car about 3/4" from the
near-center position. So maybe the total high-to-low range is
twice that.

The torsion bars are indexed using differential splines. One end
of the bar has more splines than the other. To index the bar about
1 degree CW, you will index the end of the bar with the most
splines 1 spline CCW and the end of the bar with the least splines
1 spline CW.

I say "about 1 degree" because I don't remember how many splines
are on each end of the bar. I want to say 40 and 36. Someone will
tell me I am sure if this is incorrect.

There is a spec in the Technical Specification booklet for how
much height each degree of rotation will produce (or the arm could
be measured from spindle center to torsion bar end cap center and
the value calculated).

The camber and toe adjustments can generally be made in such a way
as to minimize the change to ride height. If you are close to the
desired settings leave them as they are before starting.

Here is what I have done. Start with the car in a good state of alignment.
Remove the anti-roll bar. Bounce the rear of the car or drive back and
forth a couple of times to settle the rear. Leave the car down on the
ground. Make a little gauge out of very stiff cardboard or thin sheet metal
that will allow you to measure the position of the center of the spring
plate as close as you can to where it bolts to the trailing arm. This
measurement should be in relation to the torsion bar bearing cap, the alloy
part with four bolts holding it to the torsion tube. I hate this but here
is a picture:


              -----
-------------| o o | <-- Torsion Tube Bearing Cap, 4 bolts
)       o o  |  O  |     with torsion bar end in center
-------------| o o |
              -----

The gauge needs to align with something on the end cap. I cut
holes in the cardboard for two of the bolt heads so it looks
something like this:

    ---
   |   |    
   |    -----------
   |           o o |
   |               |
    ---------------           

Error is minimized if the gauge is long enough to get as far out as
possible on the spring plate.

Now, when the gauge is placed on the bolt heads the left hand side of the
gauge can be used to mark the position of the spring plate on the gauge.
It is good to measure and mark with pencil the center of the spring plate
out near the trailing arm to aid in this. Make the same measurement on each
side of the car with the car in the desired load configuration (driver, 1/2
tank gas, etc.) This measurement will be the loaded ride height reference.

Jack up both sides of the rear, use brush or spray paint to mark the
position of the trailing arms on the spring plates (don't scribe!), remove
the trailing arms and make the same measurement as above on each side of
the car. This will be the unloaded ride height.

The difference in the two marks on the gauge will be the suspension travel
between completely unloaded and loaded. Your goal is to install the new
torsion bars so that the correct unloaded measurement is obtained for the
new torsion bar stiffness.

I assume you are putting in larger torsion bars. So the desired new
unloaded height will be less than the old unloaded height because the new
bars will have to twist less than the old ones to support the same amount
of weight. Simple, yes?

For example, say the distance between the two marks on your gauge is 2 inch.
Multiply this distance by the ratio of the old bar stiffness to the new bar
stiffness. Stiffness for solid bars is proportional to the diameter to the
4th power. Hollow bars will have a "solid bar equivalent" stiffness so use
that. Say the old bar was 23.5mm and the new one is 28mm (both solid). Then
calculate the new unloaded position (on the gauge, relative to loaded):

2 inch * (23.5 ^ 4) / (28 ^ 4) = .99 inch

So you measure down 1 inch from the "loaded" mark on the gauge and index
the bars to align the spring plates with that mark. This is a little
tedious because my gauge requires you trial fit the bearing cap and
at least a couple of the bolts (not completely tightened but not loose
either) to get a reference. Maybe you can think of something better to
use as a reference but the important thing is that it has to be referenced
to the torsion tube axis when the tube has been dropped from the car.

Don't make the mistake of taking measurements only to find your reference
point gone when the bar is down!

A couple of other points. After you make the measurements and before you
drop the tube, reset the ride height eccentric to the center of the range.
This will provide you with a little adjustment range for corner weighting,
ride height trimming, etc. At first you might think that you'll blow your
measurements but remember we are making everything relative to the spring
plate out near the trailing arm, removing the eccentric from the
measurement.

Replace any fasteners that show any signs of corrosion. White oxidation
on whatever they plate them with is OK but orange or red rust means
the thing should be trashed. Definitely replace the lock nuts on the
height eccentric and the fixed bolt there. Also the bolts and lock nuts
on the trailing arm to spring plate, regardless of their state of corrosion,
because they usually get munged up during alignments.

You will have to remove the alloy chassis brace parallel to and forward
of the torsion tube. It also helps to rotate the torsion tube a little CW
(when viewed from right side of car) as it comes down to clear the dogs
on the transaxle.

Inspect the new torsion bars for nicks or scratches in the paint and
re-paint any problem areas. Grease the bars with bearing grease and
coat the splines with moly-based CV joint grease or similar before
installation. Take care not to scrape the bars on the torsion tube
diring insertion. Any scratch through the paint will allow for the
formation of rust creating a stress riser and increasing the odds
for sudden failure.

The parking brake cables can be left attached to the trailing arms if
you can stand to leave the arms under the car while you work. This will
save you a little time.

Almost forgot, when you put the tube back up, one side of the chassis has a
hole for the bearing (the torsion tube to chassis bearing, down low with
axis perpendicular to the tube axis) and the other side has an elongated
hole. I think the right side has the hole (gotta start writing some of this
down). Be sure to align the tube/bearing to the side with the hole or you
will get the tube up there and find that you can't get the bolt in!

I asked some of these same questions a couple of years ago and Kevin
Gross was kind enough to give me some pointers. So maybe this will help
someone else.

Usual disclaimers apply. I don't do this for a living (a good thing too
because I'd starve!) so there are I am sure lots of tricks the pros play.

Sorry about the English units.
