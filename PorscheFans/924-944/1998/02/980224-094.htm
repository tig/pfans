Here are some responses to a couple of posts. 
re belt noise: There may be some differences between 944S and 944/924S belt
noises, but I just did mine in December on an 87 924S, and it whined like a
turbine with bad bearings. After 600 miles and no change, I set the idler
roller on the balance belt so that it just barely touched the belt with no
defelection, in reality the belt now slabs it as it vibrates keeping the
roller in constant motion slower than the belt. The book called for 0-1 mm of
deflection in the belt, which is how it was originally set, with 1mm of
deflection. Without the belt deflection the whine was gone. It only makes
sense, due to the toothed belt and non-toothed roller, each tooth slaps the
roller. 

re Jim Crow's steering rack hose connection, that is a vent line which allows
the air pressure to equalize from one side of the rack to the other when you
steer, so the boots don't act like accordians, the air from the compressing
boot is displace to the other side of the rack, the expanding one. My car also
had this same exact problem, I managed to pull the 90m degree fitting just far
enough out of the house to get it into the rack and then push everything
together as best as I could. I have not checked it since, but I should. My
guess is the hose is plastic and shrinks, maybe made of the same stuff as the
dash! The danger of not having it in properly is dirt or water getting sucked
into the rack, and if your are really concerned you could pull the boots back
to clean, but I would not bother since 
a: the holes are far up on the rack and
b: these racks fail quickly enough anyway due to hydraulic seal problems. 
I would get it back in there though. Your could likely  fashion an extension
with some hose and nylon ties, if you cut back the original hose a bit.
