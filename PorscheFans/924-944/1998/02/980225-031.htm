=0AHi Greg=0A=09I DO NOT agree with your statment: =93Gas torches for wel=
ding, do not belong in=0Aautomotive body shops, period!=94. While I think=
 I understand what your statment=0Asaying or implying about a fire hazard=
, but  I have quite a few line asembly=0Avideos showing BMW/Porsche/MB us=
ing a gas torch to flash or seal the weld=0Aseams! Not for the main weld =
just to cover up the seam. Ture most modern body=0Ashops do not want a po=
tential fire hazard but that is not how the car was=0Abuilt! And any body=
 shop idiot that would use it for a structure weld is just=0Aplain dumb. =
BUT - Germans (and others) have used and are using gas torches to=0Aseal =
certain welded areas (area where the quarters pannels join, or fenders=0A=
join to the body) in their body shops durring the asemblt process. Have e=
ver=0Aseen how a E-36 (325i series or a 356) was made? =0A=0ABest regards=
,=0ADavid Jalali=0A=0A------------=0AGreg Wrote....=0A=0A=0AGas torches f=
or welding do not belong in automotive body shops, period!  I-CAR=0Aand =
=0ATech-Cor standards for collision repair specify mig welding only.  I c=
an think=0Aof only =0Aone use for a gas torch and that would be for stres=
s relieving during frame =0Astraightening.  Gas torches should never, nev=
er, never be used for any sheet=0Ametal in a =0Avehicle, and especially s=
o if it is structural metal.  If you are not properly=0Aequipped =0A& tra=
ined then hire the job out to someone who is.  End of story.=0A=0Ap.s  Do=
n't even discuss brazing.  I don't want to hear it!  Gas torches have=0Ap=
ushed my =0Abutton ever since I worked a claim (I'm an insurance adjuster=
) where two=0Apeople were =0Akilled who should have easily lived because =
some idiot brazed structure parts=0Aof a car =0Atogether and the parts fa=
