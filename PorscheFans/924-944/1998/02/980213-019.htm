It's interesting someone brought up the Girl/Porsche interaction. I've
found that overall, its usually not positive. When I first got my car, I
figured the girl I was dating would be happy that I would be driving her
around in a nice, clean, beautiful Porsche instead of my beat up honda CRX.
I was puzzled by her lack of reaction, and only later when we broke up did
I find out that she thought I was stupid to buy that "money pit" because
she wanted someone who would save all his pennies so that she wouldnt have
to work and could stay home with the kids. 
   I've never had a girl look twice at me while driving that car, but when
it was being repaired after a minor collision, I rented a Camaro, and all
sorts of girls gave me the eye. 
    I think that most girls just dont " get " the car. They think I must
have bought it to scam on girls and assume Im some kind of Romeo that wants
a flashy car to impress the girls. Actually, I would own that car if I was
the only one left alive on the planet. Its purely for my enjoyment. I did
have one ex girlfreind run out and by a NA 944 after driving mine and she
got it for its status value.(she bought an automatic...Yeech.)
    I do notice that almost half the Porsches I see are driven by women,
yet 99 percent of us on the list are male, and I've only seen one girl at a
PCA autocross. 
     Oh well, Vive la differance!
Any observations from others?
