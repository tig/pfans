Hi,

I attended a dyno day yesterday for some friend's cars and thought the
numbers would make for some interesting reading:

1993 RX-7 Turbo, converted to single turbo, lots and lots of mods, an 
intercooler bigger than our radiator!  315hp @ 6800rpm and 257ft-lb @ 6400rpm
at the wheels.  The car had a big stumble around 6300-6600rpm so the numbers
could be a bit higher.  Unusual torque peak for a turbo car, but I don't
know anything about rotories.  This car was running only 0.7bar boost.

1993 RX-7 20B, converted to a tri-rotor normally aspirated motor.  310hp @
7200rpm and 225ft-lb @ 7000rpm.  Once again, a low torque number at a very
high RPM.  Above 7000rpm, the torque dropped off quite a bit to its 9000rpm
rev limiter.  The owner wants to bump the limiter up to 10,500rpm.

1989 944 Turbo (not mine) with APE chips, cat-con bypass, aftermarket
muffler and port matched intake manifold.  240hp @ 5250rpm and 275ft-lb @
4250rpm.  The car was run with the A/C on by accident so the HP is likely
a bit lower than it should be, perhaps 5-10hp.  The car was running 1bar
boost.

1996 Pontiac Trans-Am with a bunch of engine bolt-on stuff.  No forced 
induction, 300hp and 300ft-lb of torque.  I don't remember the RPM's, but
they were fairly low compared to the higher strung cars.

All above figures are at the wheels measured on a dynojet.  I think I now
officialy have the 3rd slowest car in the group (at least on the dyno that
is) :(
