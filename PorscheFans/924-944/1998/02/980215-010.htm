Two questions for the list.  Lately when my 87 924S sits outside =
overnite and it's cold (I live in Pitttsburgh PA), when I start the car =
in the morning it runs very rich for 10-20 seconds.  It blows some black =
smoke out the exhaust and then runs perfectly.  My first thought was =
that an injector was leaking fuel into a clynder after the engine was =
shut off but if the car sits at work for 8-10 hours it does not run rich =
when started.  Any ideas what it could be?  Problem #2 recently my temp =
gauge started going up to the mark past the 1/2 mark on the temp gauge =
while driving on the highway.  It never gets into the red zone but is =
warmer than usual.  No coolent leaks and the coolent level has stayed =
ok.  I replaced the thermostat and the problem went away for about two =
weeks, it is now doing the same thing.  Any ideas what to check next?
Thanks
