Here in the Los Angeles South Bay area, I'd wager to say almost 2/3 of the
944 drivers I've seen are women.  911 is still primarily men, though.  But,
no offense meant to women 944 drivers here, take one of my female coworkers
for example.  She came in to work a couple months ago saying she bought a
944.  I'm like, "Awesome!  Turbo or normally aspirated?"  I got a blank
look and a "Huh?" in response.  Right then she should have turned over her
keys to me and walked away in shame. :)

I too have not received any second looks from the fairer sex in my
excellent condition 944.  Sad thing is, there's so many of them out here.
Porsches that is.  Well, and the women too.  I see more 911's than Camaros
every day.  Back when I lived in Michigan and was looking to buy a 951, my
girlfriend and her friends were all oohing and ahhing over it.  Out here
it's mroe like "Oh, you own one too?" or "Why don't you put lots of VTEC
stickers, bright blue driving lights, a 8" polished exhaust tip, and 2"
wheel spacers on it?  Oh, and give the wheel 10degrees of camber."  I
thought the dark window tint the PO had was bad enough.

So Roxy, if you happen to have any 20-something friends in Southern
California that can appriciate a great car kept in great shape, I'm
accepting phone numbers. ;)

I have noticed one big change in people's reactions since getting my 944.
When I drove my rather aged Nissan, I was usually the first off the line at
a green light, and everyone else would just take off at a nice, slow
comfortable speed.  But in my 944, leaving the line at about the same
speed, everyone seems to feel the need to go faster.  From Jeeps to Chevy
Vans to other old Nissan Sentra drivers.
