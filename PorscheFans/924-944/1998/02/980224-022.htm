     Due to the whole Mobile 1 discussion, I thought I'd ad my experience 
     as I'm new to the 944.  The PO ran standard oil in the car, but 
     changed it frequently (every 2k once the car hit 100k).  The car now 
     has 139k on the original motor.  I've been running Castrol full 
     synthetic in my other vehicle for the last two years, and so when I 
     changed the 944, I added it.  When I purchased the car (on the old 
     oil)  it ran 5 bar oil pressure at startup, once it was fully warmed 
     it ran 3 bar at idle and hit 5 bar at around 3k.  Only on one very hot 
     day sitting (it took 40 minutes to go 3 miles) did the pressure drop 
     to just under 3 bar.  After changing to the Castrol Synthetic the car 
     now idles at 4+ bar even after the motor is warm.  Maybe some more 
     experienced guys could comment, but I am confused as to how the car 
     would produce more oil pressure at idle from just Synthetic oil?  
     Should I suspect my gauge?
     
     Just rambling,
