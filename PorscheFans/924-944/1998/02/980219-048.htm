ROW cars turn on the left rear fog lamp when the front fogs are on, except
Japan where it is the right one. Only one rear fog is lit. I bet that the
wire is hot when the front fog is on if you check it with a meter. But you
might have to put a relay or fuse in the front box.

	I've been looking at the schematics in the back of the
	Haynes manual the past couple of nights.  Specifically
	the diagram on page 209 (1990 edition, though the back
	page lists cars as new as 1995...)

	It definately states that the extra lights are for
	rear fogs.  But shows the wiring also being connected
	to the 'USA only' side marker lamps.  (This makes some
	sense as the side marker lights are daisy-chained from the
	rear taillight assembly.)

	Do the ROW cars actually have seperate instrument panel
	switch for front and rear fog lights?  Because that is
	what the diagram seems to show at the top of the page.
	My (USA) car only has one fog switch, and I note that
	there is a blank spot next to it.  If ROW cars have seperate
	switches for front and rear fogs, where does the switch
	for the extra driving lights go for ROW S/Turbo models?
	Or am I missing something obvious?

	I'm now wondering if there is some sort of patch in US cars
	to apply side marker power to the lead - even though
	this isn't shown in the Haynes manual.  I won't have a
	chance to actually look at the car until the weekend.
