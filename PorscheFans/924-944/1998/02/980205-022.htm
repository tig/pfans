Hello everybody,

I need help, but thats the beside the point, I had to drive my baby in too
much snow this morning.  Now I have a hose that is where it shouldn't be.

Along the driver's side rocker panel, I now have a hose that is just
hanging there.  It was attached just under the panel with tie straps.  The
hose itself is about 1/4" to 1/2" inner diameter.  I tried tracing under
the car to see where it comes from but I reach a dead end just by the wheel
well.  It appears to go into the engine compartment from there.

Could this be a vacuum hose or is it something else?  I didn't notice the
car running rough though.

TIA,

Roxanne
