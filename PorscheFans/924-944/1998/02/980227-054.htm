There is a position in the VIN that can be either 'N' or 'S', 
indicating a build location of 'Neckarsulm' (i.e. Audi) or 'Stuttgart' 
(i.e. Porsche).
I don't know how faithfully Porsche used that VIN position to indicate 
the actual build location of every given car (i.e. maybe they just 
used 'N' for ALL 944's, because they initially unquestionably got 
built there). Given that it seems from past discussions (specifically 
on the 928 list) that options codes on the sticker and actual options 
present in the car don't always match, I have to wonder.
Anyway, maybe people can go check their VIN's and respond with model, 
model year, and N vs. S so we can collect statistics on this. (I'm 
willing to collect responses and post summary to the list; mail me 
directly at chrisrom@attachmate.com)

Hello P-Fans

	If my memory serves me right, Porsche took over production from Audi 
for the
924/944 series II, sometime in 1988. I thought starting with late '88 
M.Y.
production, the cars were all built by Porsche in Stutgart.

	Does anyone else have more light to shed on this subject?
