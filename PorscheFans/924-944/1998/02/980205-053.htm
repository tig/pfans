The height of the wheel tire combo is not the defining constraint for
fitment. (I am assuming here that you are alluding to the number of
revolutions for the ABS sensor pickups derived from the height/diameter)
The the more pragmatic problem is the size of the calipers on the ABS
equiped cars.  The 15" wheels will not clear the calipers (at least on my
car). 

>Does anyone have hard data as to what the case really is?

I am going to provide the information in a slightly different manner -
rather than wheel offsets for each car - I am going to list the wheel type,
corresponding part number and it's offset relative to the car/s it will
fit. (restricted to the 944)

Since I am a two finger typist, (I couldn't ask my secretary to type
blatantly non work related stuff)  this is the one and only time I am going
to post this info on the list. (Yes! I do know how to use the save button) 

The factory technical bulletin goes like this:
944 up to 1986 will accept the following FUCHS:

6JX15	911-361-020-10	36.0mm 	
	911-361-020-90	36.0mm

7JX15	911-361-020-41	23.3mm
	911-361-020-93	23.3mm

8JX15	911-361-020-42	10.6mm
	911-361-020-94	10.6mm

6JX16	911-361-020-43	36.0mm
	911-361-020-97	36.0mm
or
	911-362-113-00	36.0mm
	911-362-113-90	36.0mm

8JX16	951-362-117-00*	23.3mm
	951-362-117-90*	23.3mm
*these will also fit up to 1986 turbo

944 up to 1987, 944S, and 944 turbo up to 1998
will accept the light alloy forged (S4) as follows

6JX16	477-601-026-D		53.0mm

6JX16	944-362-113-00	52.3mm
	944-362-113-01	52.3mm

7JX16	944-362-113-00	52.3mm
	944-362-115-01	52.3mm

944 turbo S and 944 turbo 1989 and up will accept (S4) as follows:
(will also fit 944 turbo 1997/98 although the factory does not say so)

7JX16	928-362-115-00	65.0mm
	928-362-115-01	65.0mm

8JX16	928-362-117-00	52.3mm
	928-362-117-01	52.3mm

944 turbo S and 944 turbo 1989 and up will accept light alloy forged club
sport (seven spoke) as follows:
(will also fit 944 turbo 1997/98 although the factory does not say so)

7JX16	951-362-115-30	65.0mm
	951-362-115-31	65.0mm

8JX16	928-362-117-30	60.0mm
	928-362-117-31	60.0mm

944 up to 1986 will accept the following Phonedials:

6JX15	911-361-023-46	36.0mm

944, and 944 turbo up to 1986 will accept the following Phonedials:

7JX15	951-362-104-00	23.3mm

7JX16	951-362-114-00	23.3mm

8JX16	951-362-116-00	23.3mm

924S only, will accept the following phonedials:
(don't ask me why)

6JX15	944-362-102-00	52.3mm

944 up to 1987, 944S, and 944 turbo up to 1998
will accept phonedials as follows:

7JX16	951-362-114-01	52.3mm

8JX16	951-362-116-01	52.3mm

944, and 944S 1987 and up will accept the following phonedials:

7JX15	944-362-104-00	52.3mm

944 up to 1996 will accept the following "Cookie Cutters"

6JX15	911-361-023-40	36.0mm
	911-361-023-44	36.0mm
	911-361-023-45	36.0mm

7JX15	911-361-023-50	23.3mm
	911-361-023-54	23.3mm
	911-361-023-55	23.3mm

Now the list knows as much as I do (most probably a lot more) about wheel
offsets for the various 944 types.  Perhaps someone has a list of wheels
p/ns and offsets for the S2 and 968 types.

Hope this helps. BTW do not blame (or flame) the typist for errors.
