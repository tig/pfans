In case anyone is interested in maintenance data for the 951, here is some
more information.  Jim Crow, you had also asked for this.

Last night I picked my car up from the shop.  It has 75000 miles and I had
the timing and balance shaft belts replaced, three rollers(2 toothed, on
smooth) along with the water pump and the coolant hose going from the pump
to the turbo cooling pump.

The PO had cut corners once more and installed an non-Porsche timing belt. 
It was noticeably narrower than the Porsche belt that was installed.  The
dry rotting on the belt was minimal.  Given the width difference though I
can see why some belts snap like they do and am glad I did not wait the
45k miles to change it.

Taking the pump out was not easy, some of the bolts were frozen.  Also,
the hose to the turbo coolant pump did not like the fitting on the new
pump and started swelling when put under pressure.  It was replaced.  The
old pump did make bearing noise so it was prudent to have it replaced. 
The new pump is not new at all, it is a Porsche-rebuilt pump, cost $279,
but I get the 2 year warranty with it, so it will do (and hopefully last
more than 2 years or PCNA will hear about it).

Two of the three rollers replaced made bearing noises and the third one
had play in it.

Total of about $1000 for all of this.  

Regardless of what the shop says, I will drain the green antifreeze, flush
the cooling system with water multiple times (to get rid of the 5% ^ N
leftovers) and probably use the Autobahn brand antifreeze.  The Porsche
dealer actually sells it a $1 less than the VW dealer that is across the
street and gives me the PCNA discount on top. Another possibility is the
MB or the BMW antifreeze.  I have not been able to find Valvoline or
Prestone suitable offerings in St. Louis and Volvo charges a ridiculous
amount. 

I hope this is useful to someone.
