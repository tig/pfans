Mark,

Sorry to hear about what you found out.  I would think that the car has
been licensed in a state other than yours if your title does not say
salvage/rebuild.  Unfortunately, title procedures are not the same in all
states and what qualifies as a salvage/rebuild title in one state may not
in another.  I know that doesn't ease your pain any but if you are planning
on keeping the car for awhile, make it your baby and try to find out as
much as about what was done to get the vehicle back into a saleable state
after it was totalled.  That way you can at least know what isn't
"original" on it and also know of possible potential problems with it in
the future.

Once again, sorry for your bad news.

Roxanne
