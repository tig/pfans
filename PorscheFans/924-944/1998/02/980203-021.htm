I asked this question the other day and did not get any response so I
thought I would try one more time.  I have the head back on and torqued
and will finish installing the cam assembly tonight.  My timing belts I
ordered will be here tomorrow.  I would like to install them but am not
sure of the procedure.  I do not have the special tensioning tool.  Is
this tool needed to apply the tension or to set the tension or both.
Does the 89 have an automatic tensioner and how does it work.

I have been told by two knowledgeable mechanics that it is possible to
set the tension on the belt without the tool.  The mechanic in Memphis
who was recommended by PCA does not own the tool and tensions the belt
from experience.  I plan to take it to him and let him check it but I
need the car running.  Should I leave the old belts on and let him do
the changing?  I am not afraid to tackle the job but I need advice and
maybe special tools, I don't know.  In any case I have to at least
retension the old belt to drive the car to a shop.  I have searched
through some of the old archives and have been unable to find a
procedure.  The procedure in the service manual is for using the special
tool and the Haynes manual is not clear.  Thanks,

Randall Morton
