If any of you have been following my posts you will know I have been
making a few mods to my 89 944T.  The mods were:  PowerHaus head &
manifold, K-27 turbo, PowerHaus clutch & lightened flywheel.  I also
have the drilled cycling valve, Autothority chips and Bursch bypass
pipe.

I got the car back yesterday and am loving it.  I am running about 17
lbs. of boost(not as much as when I blew the head gasket, 24 to 30lbs)
but it feels close to as fast now as it was with the higher boost
before.  The idle is slightly rougher, I believe due to the lightened
clutch & flywheel, but most people would not even notice.  The clutch
pedal is a little heavier but I am getting used to it quickly.  The off
idle(before turbo) response is much improved and makes the car much more
enjoyable to drive.  The car also has new SO2's which is also an
improvement over the old Pirelli's(the rear ones were slick).

The car now makes me smile whenever I drive it, even at lower RPM under
part throttle.  I believe there is slightly more lag with the K-27 DR
than with the stock turbo but the improved bottom end makes this less of
a factor.  When the turbo kicks in, it does nail you to the seat and the
SO2's hold traction much better than the old Pirelli's.  I have a 95 993
C4 which is a beautiful car but I had rather drive the 944.

I have not upgraded the chips yet for the K-27 as I might go with the
Mass Flow Sensor instead which comes with a different set of chips.  I
will definitely get it Dynoed before I do any more major mods and will
let everyone know the results.

I did not do the clutch, water pump or timing belts myself, but I did do
the turbo, manifold and head and learned quite a bit about the car.  The
more I learn about this car the more it amazes me.  I believe it is
still one of the best sports cars you can buy to drive on the street
every day at any price.  I'd rather have an F-50 but who can afford one
and who would drive it on the street if they could?

Happy motoring,  Randall Morton
