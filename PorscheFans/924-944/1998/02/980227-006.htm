Robert,

Yes, the wheel should come off.  The procedure is strait forward.  According
to the good book the only special care recommended is storing the bag facing
up in a safe place.  They actually go as far as recommending locking it up if
it is to be stored for more than a day or two.

There are two Allen head screws that secure the air bag to the wheel.  They
are located behind the wheel on either side and point toward the driver's
seat.  Remove both fasteners.

The bag can then be pulled forward and tilted down.  There is a clip on wire
connector (the detonator) attached to the back side of the air bag, pull this
free and store the bag face up where it will not be disturbed.

There is a large nut on the steering wheel that must be removed and the wheel
can be yanked off.  However, you should mark the orientation of the wheel
relative to the threaded shaft to insure correct alignment when refitting.

Once the wheel is off, remove the black plastic panel behind the wheel (four
Phillips screws) and you should then have enough clearance to remove the
instrument cluster.

Do not try to remove the cluster without removing the wheel.  While the non
air bag equipped cars can get the cluster out without too much effort, the air
bag wheel is larger and prevents safe cluster removal.  A previous owner did
that to my car and broke the cluster.  I had to order about $100 in parts to
fix it.

The manual did not say anything about removing the battery.  The air bag
system also retains a charge after power is disconnected, but I do not know
the length of that charge.  I did not disconnect my battery, but you can do as
you feel.  Since the air bag system contains an explosive charge, you should
exercise caution when working with the system.
