There is a tool that Porsche sells that you put between the idler pulley and
the lower balance shaft pulley (with balance shaft belt on).  Your suppose to
turn the idler pulley clockwise until it is touching the tool, then tighten it
down.

The tool is nothing more than a bent sheet of metal.

If I remember correctly the manual states that a .5mm feeler gauge can be
substituted for the tool.  In all, it is a PITA to make sure the pulleys don't
budge while you tighten them.

I believe it is suppose to be set to the run in tension.  I don't remember the
manual specifying it though.  I used mine for my new belt and when I
retensioned it.  The newly designed back belt covers don't allow enough room to
put the belt gauge between the timing belt and back cover without applying
tension to the timing belt.

The faq has a procedure for using the auto tensioner.  Last time I looked it
says to back off 1.5 teeth on the timing belt.  Do not back off when using the
auto-tensioner (only back off when using the tensioning tool)

The bad thing is the auto tensioner is only for the timing belt.

Don't know anything about the rest of the questions.

Sometimes, small things come in big packages but
  once in awhile, a big thing is crammed in to a
    small package, and the package breaks.
