Samual,

I purchased my rebuilt pump from Auto Atlanta last fall.  I also bought all
the rollers and belts from them too.  The main reason for using AA is that
they are only a few miles away and the dealer is clear across town.  If I
had it to do over again I would have purchased everything from the dealer.
I think the dealer had a rebuilt pump for $149.  AA gave me wrong parts and
I kept having to go back.  They didn't have all the parts for the update
kit.  As a matter of fact, they don't keep much in stock for 944's.  They
get them from a parts wholesaler in Atlanta.  I can't tell you how many
times I've gone by there and they tell me they don't have "it" in stock but
"they can get it in a couple of hours".  One roller I bought from AA for
$66 was $24 at the dealer.  Sean who works the parts counter is a great guy
and is more than willing to help but the whole water pump experience has
soured me on AA.  I usually just go to the dealer now.

I also noticed you mentioned Sikkens (pronounced sick-ens) paint.  I was at
the gym yesterday and this man I see in there all the time mentioned he was
in Mexico City for business.  I knew he worked for an International company
and asked him who it was.  He told me the name (can't remember) and they're
based in Holland.  I asked what they did and he said the division he works
for makes paint for cars.  I asked what brand and he said Sikkens.  I've
always heard from people I know in the autobody repair business that it is
great paint.  Some shops won't use it because you have to use special spray
guns (paint canister is at the top of the gun) and most times you have to
attend a school to learn how to apply it properly.  I've seen some awesome
looking paint jobs with Sikkens.  I don't think you could go wrong using
it.  As far as cost goes, it has been a very long time since I've had to
pay for a paint job, but I would imagine if you wanted a first rate paint
job it would cost between $2000-$3000.

I restored an '88 MGB a few years ago and my friend in NC owns a paint shop
and painted it for me.  I stripped the entire car until it was a metal tub
when I took it into the shop.  No interior, no engine, just 4 wheels and a
steering column.  He owed me a favor so it didn't cost anything except
materials.  He used Duron Centari enamel.  I asked how much he would have
charged someone off the street and he said $1200 because the car was pretty
easy since I had already stripped off the parts (many more than they would
have).  Plus he replace the 2 rear quarter panels  and 2 door skins.  The
car turn out great but it wasn't a show quality paint job.  The cost is
going to depend on how good of a job you want done.  

Good luck with everything.
