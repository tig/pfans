    Thanks for the response. I am really surprised the ckt only checks at=

startup, that is a bummer. Where exactly is the circuit located? I ask be=

I would like to try and take advantage of the sensor in my oil pan by buy=

installing it. Is this just another little black box, or is it built into=
 the =

dash or DME? Anyone have the electronics for sale?
Thanks,
       Ezra
