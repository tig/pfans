Having completed my cylinder-head R & R, 8 valves, guides, and stem seals,
water pump, all hoses, all belts, all front seals, and clutch on my '87 944
about 3000 miles ago, I an now getting down to the more obscure questions
and problems.

I am hoping one of you have a factory manual or the knowledge to assist me
with these questions...

1.  What is the correct procedure for adjusting the position of the "idle"
pulley for the balance-shaft belt?  I have heard so many opinions on this my
head is spinning, I'd like to hear what the factory manual has to say on
this one.

2.  Is the "automatic" spring tensioner on the '87 designed to properly
tension a new belt or a run-in belt?  I.E. should I allow the automatic
tensioner re-tension my now run-in belt?  I don't have the $500 tension tool
; (

3.  The previous owner had screwed up the throttle body, the return spring
was all stretched out and the "stop screw" was missing.  I have replaced the
return spring and installed a "stop screw" and lock nut.  What is Porsche's
procedure to set this stop screw?  This is the screw that is supposed to
keep the throttle from closing completely, I suppose to keep the throttle
body and throttle plate from wearing on one-another.  I am sure there is
some specific gap I should be setting this to.

4.  Related to question 3, once I get the throttle plate "stop screw" set
right, what is the correct procedure to set the "base idle" with the idle
adjuster on the throttle body?  I have read in a service manual for the
earlier cars that you disconnect and plug the idle control motor's plumbing,
and set the idle to a specific "base idle", then re-enable the idle control
motor.  However, the manual says that  is not the correct procedure for my
'87, but they do not give the correct procedure.  I hope someone has this
outlined in a factory manual and they'd be willing to share it with me.

5.  I have been following the recent thread on the micro-switch in the
center of the sun-roof.  What does this switch control?  I think it has
something to do with sensing if the roof is installed or not.  Mine seems to
have no function, and I am wondering if it is shorted somewhere or if the
previous owner may have by-passed it.

6.  I have heard that a quart of oil every 700 miles is the limit set by
Porsche for acceptable oil consumption.  Mine uses about a quart every 1000
miles.  Is that an unusually high amount for a car with new valve guides and
stem seals?  It isn't leaking out of the engine anywhere, and it never
smokes. There is now about 104K miles on the car.  I am using 10W-40
Valvoline, non synthetic, no additives, in Florida.

7.  How do I replace the bulb behind the clock (87 style dash)?

These questions I have asked earlier, but received no response...

8.  Any advice on replacing a rack-and-pinion input (pinion) shaft seal?
Mine leaks so badly that I have removed the power steering belt and am
living without PS for now.  I don't mind, but my wife wants the PS working.

9.  Any tips, advice, comments from someone who has had their transaxle
apart?  Mine has a bad bearing that makes it difficult to shift while
stooped, and makes noise.  I found parts of I believe to be the "bearing
retainer" or "bearing cage" in the fluid.  I think it was the victim of a
bad clutch rubber center, I am not sure how long the previous owner had
driven the car that way, but I think the clutch "hammered" the transaxle to
death.

Thanks again to all of you on this list for all the help so far.  I am
enjoying the car a great deal,  and it has been coming along nicely.  Now
that the car is back on the road, I have been tackling the little,
"annoying" problems.  I sure wish the PorscheFans site had a search ability,
since I suppose most of these things have been discussed in the past.
