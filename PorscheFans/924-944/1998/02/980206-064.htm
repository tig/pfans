Hi P-Fans,

Ha! The day AFTER I just about gave up on my door handle, Mr.SV056@aol.com
delivers.  I got the part, and all is good.  So forgive me for being a
pesimist.  3 for 3, this list has been a life ($$$) saver.  

Thanks all,
-tony

>This is a response to the sale of car parts for the 1986 car by

>I purchased a much needed passenger door handle from him.  Can't complain
about the price, but the problem is, he got the check on 1/23/98, but I've
yet gotten my part.  I'm NOT saying he'll take my money for nothing, but
until I get my part, I feel I should give fair warning to the rest of the
P-Fan list.  Hope I don't piss him off, or I'll never get a door handle.
Hope SV056@aol.com and the list understand my need to communicate this,
because I would appreciate it if someone does the same.

ASAP service.  He probably still have a some stuff left, mostly parts from
a 87&88 944.
