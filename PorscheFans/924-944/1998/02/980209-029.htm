Before everyone gets all cranked up about this project, the copyright issue
needs to be addressed. Porsche does not sleep when it comes to unauthorized
use of the crest, so I imagine it would not look to favorably on copying
and distributing the workshop manuals. Lets face it, Porsche probably makes
a profit on the manuals, so this would be competition for those dollars.
Before you consider some clever way to put them on a disk as an archive
copy of someone's microfiche, keep in mind that if Porsche thinks it is a
violation of its copyright, do any of you have the bucks to defend against
Porsche's claim? And if you do have the bucks, do you really want to spend
it defending against this type of claim?

Best thing to do is address it head on and see if Porsche will grant
permission to make and sell the workshop manuals on CD. Perhaps they will
do it on a royalty basis.

Just my opinion.
