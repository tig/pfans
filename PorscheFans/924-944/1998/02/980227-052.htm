     I just bought a '94 968 Cab. with 23k miles - in beautiful condition 
     cosmetically as well as mechanically. I almost can't contain myself - 
     I've always wanted a Porsche - I still go out to the garage and make 
     sure its really there. Actually my wife wanted it more than I did, and 
     for at least as long - besides - it's her car - I get to drive a Ford 
     Taurus - company car - but it's free. So I live for the weekends....
     
     I don't know anything about the car - except that I love it. Reputable 
     mechanics in the area tell me it's a great car. But I want to know what 
     to watch out for - what to baby-sit, and any way to enhance performance 
     without incurring undue stress on the engine. After market exhaust is 
     tempting to improve both the sound (a bit too quiet as is) and gain a 
     few horse. I've read several items to make me wary of chipping - as it 
     sounds like the computer will reject anything other than factory spec. 
     And - if you could get around that - will it take 50k miles of the life 
     of the engine? We just turned in a Volvo 850 Turbo, so I miss the kick, 
     but can't complain above 4000RPM....
     
     Any feedback/opinions/conjecture would be welcome.
