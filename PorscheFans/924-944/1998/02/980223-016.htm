Hi all,

I've been reading the list for a while now, but this is my very first
contribution. First of all, let me commend everyone for sharing their
expertise with other p-fans. I've learned a great deal about Porsches from
reading this list. 

After searching for months, I finally purchased my first Porsche last
Saturday: a '93 slate-grey 968 Coupe, with 41K miles on it. For those of
you in the Mid-Atlantic region, I got it from Don Rosen Imports, in
Conshohocken, PA. I paid $23,450 for the car. For any prospective 968
owners out there, I'll be glad to share the specifics of my purchase
experience off-line. Just drop me a note if you're interested. 

The car is in excellent shape overall. The interior is almost perfect,
with a few dings and dents on the body; nothing major. The dealer removed
an AutoThority chip that the PO had installed, as this chip "voided the
Porsche certification" (I got a 1 year warranty direct from Porsche). He
was kind enough to give me the chip, however (more on that in later
posts).

The engine feels solid, plenty of low end torque, and the clutch/gearbox
are really tight. I am a little concerned about the engine noise, however:
Never having owned a 944/968 before, I'm not familiar with their "normal"
engine noise. This car sounds a lot more high-pitch than other 4-cylinders
that I've owned in the past (Saturn, Honda Civic SI). In 1st and 2nd gears
the engine almost "whines", although the noise loses intensity as you
shift up to higher gears (and increase the speed). At highway speed, the
noise is not noticeable (or perhaps it's drowned in road noise :-).

Is this normal? Since this car is under warranty, I could take it to the
dealer to ask for their opinion, but I wanted to get your collective
opinion first.

[ Almost forgot, in case it makes any difference, this car has a
limited-slip differential ].

Thanks!
