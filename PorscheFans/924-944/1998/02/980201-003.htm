I can tell that you are having you car serviced by a Porsche dealer. For
the price of a tray of beer you can have your steering rack disassembled
and inspected by someone who knows what they are doing. Having your rack
rebuilt is a lot cheaper than buying a "rebuilt" or new rack.  Spend a
couple of minutes brousing the yellow pages for a good hydralic
specialist. If you live in a big city you should have a ZF ( they make
the rack for Porsche ) qualified technician not far away either.

Greetings,
While having my 944T serviced, we noticed a small leak in the steering
rack on both sides. It was recommended to replace the entire rack
instead of seals due to possible scoring  inside the unit.
Does anyone recommend a good place to purchase a rebuilt steering
assembly? Is there anything else that should be replaced at this time?
As always, your feedback is welcomed.
