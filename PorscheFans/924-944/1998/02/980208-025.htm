Paolo and folks,

I've seen pictures of a Turbo Cabriolet in the UK.
Looks just like the S2 Cab with the exception of
the "Turbo" lettering on the right side of the rear,
just below the trunk lid.

Since the Cab wasn't introduced until 89, I would expect
this to be a Turbo S engine.  Now MY question is, does
anyone know if this car had the Turbo S suspension?  I
know that Porsche Cars N.A. does NOT recommend stiff
suspension components on the S2 Cab -- they don't want
to feed strong suspension loads into the Cab chassis.
They didn't even offer the Koni sport shock option on
the S2 Cab (though I've put them in and have had no trouble).

A Turbo Cab. would be much fun indeed!

TKL
90 944 S2 Cab.
