I did compare the C4 to numerous 944's.  I owned and loved a 3.0 944 and my
friend has a Turbo with chips etc (~275HP?), great cars, may even be faster
than my stock C4, but not the single minded drivers car the 911 is.  I must
turn it around, have YOU driven a modern 911 on a fun road or autox course?

I think most will agree that the 911 has better, more timeless, styling and
certainly has the best sounding engine of any car, except maybe 12 cylinder
Ferraris, so the only way the 944 could be better is feel.  While this is
very subjective, I felt much more part of the 911 than the 944.  I know
this sounds like 944 bashing, but it is not.  I just think the 944's are
the second best cars, with the 911's being best.  On a value basis, I think
you have to say the 944 is a better all around car, being $10-15K for nice
examples as compared to $30k+ for C4's, but the C4 is a better drivers car
without question for me.  Remember, this all started when someone asked
which to buy, and I said drive both and decide.  They are both good but
different cars, the 944 better all around, the 911 better for pure driving
pleasure.
