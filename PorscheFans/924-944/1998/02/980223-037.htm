Are you happy with the 20$ H4 conversions?  How do they compare to Hella
or Cibie lenses?

They seem to work just fine for me. I had Hella's 7" on my MGB and they
were good too. The problem I have with the Autopal's are that I tend to
get a higher beam pattern compared when in low beam. I'm trying to
adjust the lamps so that I can get a compromise between the low and high
beam spread pattern. The low beam is very good. The high beam pattern
tends to be very narrow and straight ahead with very little side
illumination. The straight ahead illumination for objects far away is
good. My stock fog lamps makes up for that by providing a wide spread
illumination area, lighting up the sides/curbs/street shoulders so that
I can stay on track when travelling at above normal highway speeds. This
is my opinion. I never tried the Cibie lamps because I don't have a
source to purchase them from. I do know that they make aftermarket lamps
for rare and abnormal applications, i.e. -- Jaguar XJS, XJ6 or 12 large
headlamp pods, Mercedes-Benzes, Ferrari's, etc. as far as Euro cars go.
Never driven in a car outfitted w/ Cibie lamps, so I can't give a fair
product analysis. Perhaps someone else on the list who has driven a
vehicle can give a summary of how they compare to other H4 lamps. My
450SEL has Bosch H4 lamps but they're the customized assembly with the
built-in widespread beam patterned fog lamps, kinda like our factory US
spec Hella fog lamps. They are very well made though their oversized
reflector bowls were made for the body contour.
Hope this helps somewhat.
