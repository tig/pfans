Wes, 
    Thanks for the info on the software. I've been on a web site recently
that had all these calculations. However, I can't remember the name of it.
I'll do some investigation into the FDR for the S2. As it turns out, we've
discovered a number of errors in the gear ratios from the Excellence
article. It wouldn't surprise me if this was also in error. I'd like to
know for sure because I'm keeping these numbers in a Word document table
for my notes. Perhaps Tom Pultz could verify the final drive ratio for us. 

Tom, 
S2 final drive ratio -   3.889 : 1 or 3.875 : 1?

TIA
Clark
