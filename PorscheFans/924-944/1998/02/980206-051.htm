MT-90 is pretty similar to 75W90NS except it does not contain the
additives for GL-5.  Like the NS, it is "non-slippery" formula which
enhances syncro action.  I run regular MTL in my Honda 5-speed and it
works great, hot or cold.  Honda just uses normal 10W30 or 10W40 motor
oil, which are equivalent viscosity ranges to MTL and MT-90.  For a 944 I
would hesitate to use MTL or MT-90 because they don't contain the
additives to protect hypoid gears as well as the 75W90 gear oil.

What you can do is use all 75W90NS and then add enough Red Line friction
modifier (just a few ounces) until LSD clutch chatter just disappears.  I
use straight NS formula in my S2 non-LSD trans and it shifts very nicely.
