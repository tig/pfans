 Just to keep everyone informed the Midwest gathering will be a go!!  I have
already had 13
responses that were positive.  I am currently waiting to hear from the
speedway, but even 
if we cant hold ot there I have gotten the feeling that we would all have just
as much fun if we met in a park or sumthin!?  Once again, I thank everyone for
the enthusiasm and look forward
to meeting all of you in person.  I am currently fighting with my ISP as they
are putting
in a new HTML server.  I am thinking of putting my page up on my corporation
server, in 
which case I have as much disk space as I want. (funny how that works when your
a Net Admin)
Then perhaps we can put pictures from the meet on thier own (Midwest Meet)
page? Ill post more info as it becomes available:-)

Safe-Driving
Laters,
-Nick
