I've been watching this thread for the past couple of days with some
interest as I'm finishing up a total "rustoration" and conversion of a
914.  Previously - I've done restorations on three 911's and done some
welding on my 86 951.  What have I used?  An oxy/acetylene, arc, gasless
MIG and gas MIG...  A couple of things for those considering welding.

First, you do not have to get a cutting torch for any type of welding.
Buy either a Makita or other quality 4" high speed grinder with a set of
cut-off wheels.  It's a tool that you will use constantly for a number
of welding and cutting tasks - grinding metal down, cutting body
sheets/bar stock, grinding welds, etc.  Cutting with an oxy/acetylene
will leave a seam that is not flush and the edges are not finished
enough to butt weld anything.

The quality of the welds with a gas vs. gasless MIGs is true - the gas
will provide a cleaner burn which yields a cleaner weld. However, for
occasional use, a gasless MIG is fine for almost any job - including
welding sheet metal.  However, the gasless will require more practice to
achieve similar finish characteristics to the weld.  Warping sheet metal
is an outcome of poor welding practices - not gas MIGs vs. gasless
MIGs.  Someone on the 914 list (Mike Cooley) wrote a pretty good article
on how to do it a couple of months ago which I linked off my 914 web
page (http://www.wgss.com/914).  To this point, I've attached factory
steel flares to my 914 in the last three weeks using a gasless MIG -
without a single warp or wrinkle - and at about $1500 per set of flares,
it's not something I'd do without confidence in the welding system.  Oh
yea, its this same system I've rebuilt the entire 914 structure with -
from lockposts to trailing arms (again, some photos on the web page).
Proper welding technique and practice (and as importantly - preparation
of the surfaces to be welded!) will prevent some costly errors.

IMHO, for someone who wants to start welding - get a *quality* brand MIG
- either type, and spend your first 5 - 10 hours just practicing on
something other then your car.
