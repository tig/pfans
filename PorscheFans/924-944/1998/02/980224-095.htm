The rear crank seal is a one piece type seal, rubber spring loaded lip with
metal frame. They are not expensive - 15 bucks or so, I think, try vertex,
etc. They are a real hassle to get at though, so you might as well do the
clutch etc, while you are at it, unless cars with a manual are any easier,
which I doubt. One thing to be extra careful of if you do go for it is to make
sure there are no bits of the old seal stuck the wall of the case, which will
cause leaking of the new one. When you get the old seal out, if there are any
pockets in the outer rubber face, or maybe cavities is a better way to
describe them, you need to go in there with mirrors and flashlights and get
that thing surgically clean, or you get to do the whole thing twice. I was
saved that embarassment last fall by someone who had posted their experience
with same shortly before my project. The rubber sticks on stubbornly and I had
to very gently get it off with a chisel exacto knife blade, but you don't want
to scratch the soft aluminum either. My advice: don't replace it until you
need to do a clutch.
