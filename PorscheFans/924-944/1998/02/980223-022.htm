I've done the job a couple of times.  It is a major chore, and you're 
looking at 8 to 10 hours labor, not counting time to realign the car 
afterwards.  You need to remove the exhaust and transmission, mostly 
disconnect the rear semi-trailing arms, then drop the torsion bar 
carrier out (or partially out) of the car.

That's the easy part.  The hard part is then installing the new torsion 
bars and indexing them.  They're a vernier design, meaning unequal 
count of splines at each end.  You need to take very careful 
measurements off of the suspension pieces, before and after, to be sure 
you end up with the correct ride height.  You also need to take into 
consideration the fact that stiffer or softer bars, when installed, 
will compress less/more when loaded, and this goes as the fourth power 
of their diameter.  And if you want to change the static ride height, 
you also will want to take this into consideration so that the ride 
height adjustment eccentric is as close to centred as possible.

Kevin

P.S.  Don't forget to take driver's weight into consideration.  Set the 
car up for an even ride height with your weight in the driver's seat.
