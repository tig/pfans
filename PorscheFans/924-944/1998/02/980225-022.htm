	The rear wiper removal is quite simple, or atleast the
installation of it on my 85.5 944 was simple.  I am assuming that your 88
is very similar to my 85.5, (gulp).
	There is one main attachement with two supporting rods.

	0:  Remove the interior cover and disconnect the wiring plug.

	1: Flip the cap up on the rear wiper arm revealing a 13 (I think)
		nut.  This holds the arm onto to motor.

	2: Once the wiper arm is removed there should be a much larger 
		(I cannot remember the size) thin black nut holding the
		wiper to the rear glass.  This basicly pinches and
		sandwhiches the glass between the motor and the top plate.
		So with some support on the other side, unscrew this nut.

	3:  Below this nut should be a series in this order of washers an
		gromets.  Metal top-plate / rubber seal / [Glass] / rubber
		seal / motor/

	4:  The motor is also held to the rear of the glass with two pins. 
		When you have the motor released from the glass gently
		pull it forward (towards front of the car) and these pins
		should come out of the holes in the rear of the hatch.

	5:   That should be it, with the assumption that your 88 is
		similar to my 85.5


			Good luck
