Rudy,
   I knew that scanning the microfiche was not an option. Also, taking it
to a photographer that can read negatives and digitize them is not an
option. 
The only option is to use a setup that zooms in on the microfiche image
first and then captures the image. I went to a photographer yesterday who
has one of these setups. We tried to zoom the microfiche frame and then
capture the image and import it into a photoshop program. However, with the
lens on his setup, we couldn't focus the text in the frame sharp enough. We
got it to where it was readable but, the text was still fuzzy. Perhaps a
photographer that has a more advanced setup could do this but, I don't have
any in my area. I don't know exact how microfiche is made but, the same
technology could probably be applied to pulling the image off the
microfiche and then digitizing it.

Keep trying,
Clark
