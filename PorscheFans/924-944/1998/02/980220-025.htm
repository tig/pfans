Subject:	RE:  Brake modifications

I did three track days at Mid Ohio last year no brake problems whatsoever.

[Michael G. Wachholz replies]  Mid-Ohio is not that tough on brakes.  Try 
Blackhawk Farms.  That is possibly one of the tracks toughest on brakes. 
 Lee will back me on this.

A trick is to replace the stock rear brake pressure regulator from the 
stock 18 bar (PN 951 355 305 01) to the next step up; 33 bar (PN 928 355 
305 01).  There is also a 45 (PN 964 355 305 01) and 55 bar (PN 930 355 305 
01) available but I wouldn't recommend either of these with the stock, 
non-M030 calipers.

My car already has large plastic scoops that direct lots of air to the 
front
rotors.  I have always assumed that these were stock on all 968s.  Do you 
not have these?  The only thing I have ever considered to improve cooling 
is removing the shield behind the rotor.

[Michael G. Wachholz replies:]  Those plastic scoops are stock on all 968s. 
 They are the most cost effective rotor cooling you can get.  If you have 
lost them for one reason or another the cost to replace is approximately 
$40 per side.  These inexpensive little scoop are quite effective.  They is 
not a Cool Rotor kit available for the 968 like there is for 944s and 911. 
 And those are substantially more expensive.

>recommendations?

[Michael G. Wachholz replies:]  Main thing with the stainless steel brake 
lines is to get the DOT approved versions.  They are Teflon lined and will 
withstand the demand of street/track driving better than the standard 
stainless steel types.

Squishiness was not a problem for me at all.  My pedal was consistently 
firm on each of my three track days.  I think a proper flush and bleed with 
fresh high temp fluid right before a track event is more important than 
steel brake lines.  Cheaper too.

[Michael G. Wachholz replies:]  I would agree, although the DOT approved 
stainless steel brake lines cost about $80-$90 for a set of four.  In 
Porsche-land, pretty cheap.

>3)  Motul (?) 600 brake fluid.  It's supposed to have a high 500's
>(~580ish?) dry boiling point temp.  I believe this is higher that ATE
>Super Blue, which I'm using now.  It's only $12ish per pint (or whatever
>size it comes in) which is about the same as the super blue.  Castrol

I also use ATE Super Blue.  I have heard good things about the Motul, but 
right now with good results I have no reason to switch.

[Michael G. Wachholz replies:]  No offense meant here guys, but the Motul 
and ATE, IMHO, is a huge waste of $$.  The Ford High-Performance fluid has 
the same specs (over 550 degrees dry boiling point) and costs less than $3 
a pint. The ATE turns the entire system blue making it impossible to tell 
if your fluid as gotten dirty. In my region, probably 60-75% of the club 
racers are using the Ford fluid with great results.

>4)  Racing pads.  I've heard every opinion around about brake pads.  It
>seems each person or group of people swear buy one brand or another.  > Is 
there any sort of consensus on this list?

I don't think you'll ever find a consensus on the type of pad.  The only
real consensus is that its best to use track pads on the track and street
pads on the street.  Anything else is an unacceptable compromise.  Street 
pads suck on the track, and track pads dust like crazy and eat rotors at 
street temperatures.  Pads are easy to change on the 968 too.  It should 
take you less than an hour (including wheels on/off).  FWIW I use stock 
pads on the street and Porterfield pads on the track.  I chose Porterfield 
simply because I heard good things about them and I got a good deal on 
them.  I wouldn't be averse to trying a different track pad though.

[Michael G. Wachholz replies:]  Everyone seems to have their own story on 
pads all without hard evidence to back it up. I have tried Porterfields and 
Pagids.  I track the usage (track and street miles).  So far the Pagids, 
although costing $100 more per car set are getting much better mileage than 
the Porterfields.  I have a set of Hawk Blue in the garage ready for this 
season to try.

>5)  S4/951S Calipers.  Obviously the most expensive option due to the
>necessary rotors, pads, and billet adapter which will accompany the
>upgrade.

At least for now I'm not prepared to spend that kind of money for something 
that I don't perceive to be much of a problem.  Maybe someday...

[Michael G. Wachholz replies:]  I put the 89 951 calipers on my 93 968. 
 They made a HUGE difference in reducing the amount of brake fade I 
experienced under aggressive braking situations.  At Road America and 
Blackhawk Farms I could, with the stock calipers boil the brake fluid 
within a 30 minute session.  With the 951 calipers I don't get this 
problem.  Not really that expensive an upgrade either.  You can find used 
89 951 calipers for $350 a pair, will need the billet caliper adapters, 
I've seen those used for $150 a pair or $225-$265 new, and finally new 89 
951 rotors for <$100 each.  Total cost for the upgrade, <$700 if you are 
resourceful on the parts.  Well worth it.

Now here is a question for *you*.  What size R1s are you getting?  I have F 
235/45 and R 275/40.  I wanted to go wider in the front, but I was told 
that the 245/45 would be too tall.  BFG doesn't make 245/40, but Hoosier 
does, so I was thinking of trying them next time.  What are you hearing?

[Michael G. Wachholz replies:]  I also am running 17" Forgelines and R1s at 
the track. The R1s are F 245/45 on 8 x 17 and R 275/40 on 9.5 x 17.  I know 
you can get as large as 255 on 8.5 x 17 on the front and up to a 10 x 17 on 
the rear.
