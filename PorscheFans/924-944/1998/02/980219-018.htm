=======================================================

Just to refresh some memories, back in January when this first came up, I
told the list that I would try to get Mike from Speed Bleeders to work up a
"cross-reference" of the correct sizes for the different Porsche models,
since he doesn't have that listed on his website, only the specific sizes
he makes.  At that time, he was just going on vacation, so I faxed him
copies of the bleeder pages with OEM part numbers from the Automotion and
Tweeks catalogs.  I e-mailed him a reminder this morning and said there
were a bunch of recent inquiries from this list, so hopefully he will
respond to me in a timely fashion, at which point I will forward the
information to PorscheFans.
