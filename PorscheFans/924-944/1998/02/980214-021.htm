I was dating my girlfriend before I purchased my 944.  In fact she was with
me when I test drove the car.  She knew that that I had been looking for
over 6 months for just the right one.  At first, she thought the car was
nice looking & a good value.  After a few months she got jealous of all of
the time I spent on the car, not to mention how much I talked about it.

Then winter came.  I stopped driving the car for a few months.  Instead I
was driving my Pontiac Grand Am (nice, but not a Porsche).  One day she
confessed to me in the car, "I miss the 944, I feel alot safer in it."  I
agree, the brakes, suspension and acceleration do make it a "safer" car to
drive.

She understands that I plan to always own at least one Porsche.  In fact,
she has even expressed her willingness to own a 914, you know, the "cute
Porsche".
