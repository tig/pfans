Someone was asking about coolant.  To summarize, if it does not say
phosphate-free do not use it.  Since I was arguing this with my mechanic,
it is fresh in my mind and I include a message that Lee Archie was very
gracious in mailing to me.

From: "Lee C. Archie" <larchie@lander.edu>

Porsche Technical Bulletin #83-03: "Phospahte-free coolant/antifreeze is
installed in cooling system of all vehicles during production.  When
replacing coolant/antifreeze solution, only a phosphate-free product must be
used, Part No. PNA 000 200.  Caution: Antifreeze other than specified by
Porsche may cause corrosion of cooling system thus leading to engine
overheating and damage."

[snip]
Possibly what the mechanic means is the use of a "Flush" such as Prestone
"Super Flush" introduces phosphates into the cooling system which cannot be
easily and completely removed afterward.  On a non-aluminium engine, the
instructions would run (1) drain coolant, (2) add the flush with water, (3)
run engine, (4) drain, (5) add water, (6) run engine, (7) drain, and (8) add
antifreeze/coolant.  The mechanic is right--normal flushing procedures would
leave phosphate residue in the cooling system.

Prestone "Super Flush does not say on the container that it contains
phosphate.  I have been told, but do not know first-hand that most flushes
including Preston contain phosphate because this is what cleans the rust
deposits, grease, and oily residues; consequently, they should not be used
with aluminium engines.  The rule of thumb is, "If it doesn't say it doesn't
contain phosphate, it does."

Some shops have a machine which will clean the cooling system.  I have been
told (by the same Porsche guru) that these machines are not cost effective
for a shop because few customers will pay the labor and time charges for a
"safe flush."

For do-it-yourselfers flushing the system completely is a fairly long
process but well worthwhile.  Hanes Techbook "Automotive Heating & Air
Conditioning" has a 13-step procedure on pp 76-77.   Water is used as a
flush and this method ensures the entire cooling and heating systems are
cleaned out..  If anyone wants a copy, I'll be glad to send it.
