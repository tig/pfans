With fear of being bugged to death about my size, I give you the following
details:

Height:   5' 5"
Weight:   120lbs on a good day, 115lb is more normal
Shoe  :   9-9.5 (Nike)
Waist :   A paltry 28 if measured proper, 29 or 30 with pants that are
          popular of my generation.

Just as a reference, Villeneuve has a similar height, but is larger overall.
So there!

At least my karting coach is happy as pie about my weight.  His only
challenge is to figure out how to maximise the utility of adding 40lbs
of ballast to my kart to meet the min. req.
