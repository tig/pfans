Hi! I'm not too sure what year your 944 may be but if it isn't a 951,
then my friend, you were looking at it because you found it. Many
manuals may simply refer to the both of them as "engine speed sensors",
which is far from it. I have the blue Bosch Engine Management Systems
book and the yellow officially released Bosch Motronic Engine Management
Systems book. They aren't in my possession because they're at home, not
at my work office. However, I recall when trying to troubleshoot a
problem that I had with my engine hard starting when cold only. Those
two sensors are actually two different sensors. One is an engine speed
sensor which uses the actual flywheel as the reference to indicate
engine speed to the DME by magnetic induction. The number of flywheel
teeth that passes by per second is what it registers. Now, the second
sensor is what measures the engine's timing via one single peg that is
on a parallel row next to the row of flywheel teeth. (The flywheel teeth
is also the same teeth that the starter engages with to turn over the
engine.) Every complete revolution the engine makes, that peg swings
past that corresponding sensor, sending a signal to the DME indicating
TDC. The DME uses this to readjust the timing -- i.e. retarding or
advancing, to prevent knocking and pinging in conjunction with the knock
sensor located on the side of the engine block. Now, which one of the
sensors is the right one that indicates TDC, honestly I cannot remember.
Again, my books are at home. If you'd like, I can look it up for you.
I'm sure you'd want to save yourself some money by buying one
replacement sensor. The other item I can suggest is to just remove both
of them and peer down the holes with a small Maglite and see which hole
looks empty or clear and which other hole has the flywheel teeth. The
one without the flywheel teeth is your TDC sensor.

W A R N I N G !!! -- please, please keep all loose debris, tools and
screws away from those holes. If anything falls into these holes, you'll
have problems galore. So, when removing those allen head bolts that
retain the sensors, keep  a good grip on them so as to not let them go
bye-bye down those "black holes of disaster". If you have to leave those
holes open for any period of time unattended, may I suggest that you
cover them with something like cling wrap or duct tape just to protect
yourself and the holes. I don't remember what size allen key it was but
it was metric. I would suggest using one that is fitted into a socket
(maybe 3/8'' drive) and either a long, long extension or borrow a bunch
of extensions from your friends and joing them all together to make a
long extension to get the most torque to remove the allen bolts. If you
try using a standard "L" shaped allen key, you'll never move those
bolts. Furthermore, the space you have between the firewall and the rear
end of the engine block is very tight -- not enough space to fit a large
hand to work in. Let me know how it went and if you still want me or
someone else in the list to look up which sensor is the TDC sensor
versus the engine speed sensor. If someone out there on the list that
has the seven volumes of the factory service manuals, please check for
this gentleman on what it says concerning the reference sensors. The
Haynes manuals don't say crap referring to the sensors.

Standing by for your results.....
