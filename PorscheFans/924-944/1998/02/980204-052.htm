I'm no expert on these matters, but idea of the hot-wire sensor is seems
straightforward.  The platinum resistance wires are cooled by the intake
air--the more air, the more cooling. Since the hot wires are heated to a
temperature differential of 100 degrees C above the incoming air, as it is
cooled, the control circuits apply more voltage to keep the same
differential--a voltage signal which the control unit monitors.  Hence the
electronic air-mass sensor requires no correction for changes in the density
of air due to temperature or altitude, as would previous systems.  So there
is no need for compensation sensors or correcting comuptations in the
control unit with the hot-wire sensor.  It has no moving parts and responds
in milliseconds--much faster than the vane of the air-flow sensor and little
or no resistance to air (the wires are finer than a human hair--70
micrometers).
I suppose the quantitative data would come from a run over the Rockies.
Multi-point (or port injection) delivers fuel at the engine intake ports in
contrast to (single-point) injection where the intake manifold carries
air-fuel mixture.  All Bosch systems are multi-point.
