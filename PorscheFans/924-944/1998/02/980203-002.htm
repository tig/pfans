Whether or not you will get rubbing on the fenders with combination on a
86 car is dependant on a number of factors. Firstly ride height, the
lower you car is the more chance of rubbing. Secondly tires vary in
width. The Dunlops D40 M2s that I had on my 89 951 were wider than the
Bridgestone S0-2s I now have on (what's left of) my car. The tires will
fit on the stock wheels you have without any problem. Once you have
fitted these tires and if you do experience rubbing an experienced body
shop should be able to roll your fender lips. Any number of P-fans will
be able to recommend a good shop in your area. Good luck.

Hello everyone!
I am so happy to be part of you elite group of Porsche lovers.

I have a simple questions  and I hope someone will know an answer to

Will 225/55 fit on front and 245/50 fit on back on my car without
robbing?

Thanks in advance. I am sure I will get many replies.
