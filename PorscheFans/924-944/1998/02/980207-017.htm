You all may wish to wait on the G-Tech purchase.... I spoke with TESLA
about 3 weeks back and due to a significant demand, they are working on
a unit that measures 1/8 mile times as oppossed to 1/4 mile times that
should be out by spring.  I have used similar devices on my Mustang drag
cars and found them to be invaluable in tuning the car quickly without
relying on "seat of the pants" as a gauge for performance.  The 1/8 mile
unit, however, is FAR more practical on the street - 1/8 mile trap
speeds do not approach those required to run a full 1/4 mile, but
provide just as significant an indicator of performance.  Since trips to
the dragstrip during the engine development on my '72 Mustange were too
inconvienant, the analyser was a Godsend - however, even on the deserted
airport service road were I did my testing, running at well over 100 mph
on the street was a little unnerving.  The 1/8 mile unit is Far better
for those who do not have access to a drag strip.  If you would prefer
the 1/8 unit, please send e-mail to Tesla by going to their website
(http://www.gtechpro.com) and mentioning your interest in the 1/8 mile
unit.
