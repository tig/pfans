What do you mean by relay kit?  I am a novice with electricity but do want 
to upgrade to Hella lights.  I have an 89 951 with sylvania sealed beams. 
 I noticed that automotion has H4s with the 55/60 bulb for about $40 each, 
is this a good deal and is this the part I want?  What about euro Porsche 
part numbers, do you have access to those or are the actually Hella H4s?

Thanks for the help!!!!
