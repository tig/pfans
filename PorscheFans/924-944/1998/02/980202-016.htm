Dear P fans,

I know there was a discussion about this recently but I can't seem to find
it in my notes.  After a recent car wash/inspection session my son noticed
my '87 944NA has a good bit of water in the rear tail light.  I guess I
could put a few goldfish in there for that "70's retro look" but I'd rather
fix it.  I know that the gasket behind the lens will need replaced to
correct the problem.  I have pulled back the carpeting in the rear and
removed the bulb assembly and the (6) flare nuts from the back of the lens
assembly.  But the lens assembly still won't budge.  I tried some light
tapping with a rubber mallet on the back of te assembly but it didn't seem
to want to come out.  Before doing anything I might regret I thought I would
ask for advice (just guessing but I would assume this a "stupid" priced
part).  Is the assembly ready to come out and just needs a little patient
tapping/tugging or is there something else I'm missing.  I don't have the
repair manuals and of course my Haynes manual isn't very helpful.

TIA.....
