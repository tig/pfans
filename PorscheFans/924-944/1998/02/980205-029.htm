     Having finally acquired an 87 NA after much searching, I must ask some 
     simple questions to other owners of 87s. (Go easy on a new guy)  Just 
     for background info, the car is in very excellent condition and you 
     really can't tell it has 130k miles.  The transaxle is new (about 30k) 
     miles and the engine passed a pre-purchase inspection with flying 
     colors.  The car appears to have been driven gently.  My questions 
     are:
     
     
     1.  What are the big problems with this particular year?  I've hear 
     the oil cooler seals are problamatic, is this true?  Mine have already 
     been replaced.  Do you follow the 30k or 45k belt replacement?  Are 
     water pumps are fragile as on earlier models?
     
     2.  What kind of transaxle oil is best?  I want to use a synthetic.  
     The car won't see any competition, it is a daily driver that might see 
     a driving school or two.  Is there any real difference between using 
     Redline gearbox oil and a gearbox oil such as Mobil 1 or Castrol?  I 
     run Castrol synthetic motor oil in all my engines.
     
     3.  Where should the temp. gauge be?  Mine doesn't get much above the 
     first big mark.  In stop and go it got to the second, but in driving, 
     it stays low on the gauge, nowhere near the middle.  I live in 
     Florida, the temp has been around 45-55 degrees.
     
     4.  This may sound really dumb, but what shiftpoints do other 
     commuters use?  On daily commuting I usually shift a car around 3k, 
     but this car seems to drive (and shift) a lot better shifting around 
     4k.  I go pretty easy on cars during my daily commutes and only push 
     them when I can :)  Do other commuters shift at 3, 3.5, or 5?  I want 
     the car to last as long as possible and so want to go easy on it when 
     it doesn't make any difference (my commute is mostly stop and go).
     
     I know these questions sound ignorant to the best out there, but I'm 
     just new to the 944 and would like to tap the vast resource of your 
     experiences.
     
     Thanks in advance for all the help,
     Samuel
