Hi All

I have to add a note or two about some of the comments about head studs and
nuts on the 944T

I have to take difference with the comments that the studs must be replaced as
they are of the stretch variety.

Reasoning as follows:

1. Manual does not call for replacement.  audi and vw manuals state models
that should have the BOLTS replaced at servicing.  And with the detail
included in the manual, I feel it would have been included the STUDS needed
replacing.

2. The original torque specs on the 944 was a ftlbs value.  It is a later
program used on all 944Ts that calls for the 14lbs and two 90 deg pulls.  No
other mod (ie new studs etc) required.  Considering the variation in the
torque required to move the nut  when the washer began to turn, it seems the
two 90 pull method would be more consistant.  If the washer was to turn and I
continued to a set torque, the bolt would be much too tight.  Migh even lead
to breakage.

I hate to have misinformation spread and I have yet to see any documentation
otherwise.

Also I found two exaust valve guide seals loose on inspection and replace all
of them.  Yes the guides were within tolerence.

I'm amazed that the block showed no wear or lip in the cylinders at 95k miles.

Hopefully have the belts on and running by this weekend.
