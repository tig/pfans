Subject:	RE: Oil Level Warning Light

On the 944/968 there is a float gauge that shows when the oil is below the ½
way between two marks. It is a lock and hold switch so that cutting the
power for a few mins will not effect it.

 On a 944/68 when you are at the fill mark you are in trouble, the PCA
correct fill line is about ½ qt over the fill line, more if you are tracking
the car!  

So when that light goes on add a Qt.

And remember that all 944/68 motors use oil (make that consume). The spec
book will tell you what the valid range of oil consummation is.

I assumed the two storage area's in the back were for keeping Oil, tools,
and CD-players rather than just water.
	Regards,

Dan

	Funny how my problems tend to show up on the list right when I'm
having them
	:-)

	My oil level light has done the same thing a few times lately. My
oil level
	is also right in the middle of the range. It seems that if I start
the car
	and only go for a few hundred yards, turn the engine off and leave
it off
	for a few minutes (Gas station, cleaners, etc), and start it up
again, the
	light comes on and stays on! Turning the engine of and on does NOT
make it
	go away. Only after the car has been sitting for an extended period
of time
	does it not come on when the car is started again.

	Thefirst time it happened it scared me really bad as I had to drive
20 miles
	with the oil light on. I had checked and double checked the level,
but a
	little light like that can still make you nervous!

	I'll be looking for other replies about a possible fix.
