Hi Tony
	It is possible for the fuel pressure regulator to fail intermitantly! It
happened to me! Sometimes my car ran great other times it ran like crap and
sounded like the fuel pump was about to explode! The FPR is cheap at $70 and
should be replaced even if just for a preventative measure. When it finally
fails, it will dump alot of fuel onto your hot engine! The FPR took care of my
problem. 
	As far as an eradic coolant gauge. Check the connections on the back of the
instrument pannel for the gas/coolant gauge. I had to replace my two gauges to
really fix the problem! The gauge costs about $100. 

Good Luck
David Jalali

Subject: Fuel pressure regulator, again

Hi P-fans,

Well, I was real worried after some of the list members' warnings about the
bad fuel pressure regulator:  "Don't Drive It!"    Against better judgment,
I went for a spirited drive.  I pushed it hard.  No hasitation, no black
smoke, no problems...no gasoline smell.  I don't get it.  My machanic said
I have a bad FPR, that the "diaphram has failed," and that's where the
gasoline smell came from.  

I do smell gasoline smell sometimes, which was why I took it in.  After
better grounding the engine block, the irratic temp. has gone away (in
tonight's drive anyway).  Can someone tell me, is it possible for the FPR
diaphram to have failed and I still drive hard like that?  Please help, I'm
sick of almost spending money to fix something not broken, like my radiator
that isn't leaking at all, but was diagnosed "cracked."  

Thanks for any reassurance on this matter,
