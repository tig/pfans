You should get this slack out of your belt by just setting the preload
higher and therefore bealt squealing should get better (not a good idea
for the bearings of your alternator).
Like I wrote it didn't helped for me. And the bealt squealt loudest if
the car was warm in my case.

My belt didn't get polished, it was roughned only on one side. But the
belt was brand new. If the rubber of the belt is old and hardened it
can get very slippery on the surface. In that case I would try a new
one, it's simply to cheap to try a lot of tricks on it. And an old one
is more likely to fail...

Just my thoughts
