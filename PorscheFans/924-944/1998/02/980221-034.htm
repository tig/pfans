1)  Seems like every head requires a different technique for removal. 
 Some
    just come right off, others require the mallet.  What's the most 
frequent
     mode of release for the 944 head?

Never had this problem.

2)  Gasket and surface prep:  Is clean of old gasket, dirt and oil good 
enough
    before reinstallation or do I need some exotic German sealant or 
cleaner
    to make sure my new head gasket won't leak.

Cleanliness is 90% of the battle.  Scrape the surfaces down with 
straight-edge razor blades, clean with carb cleaner.  No, don't use any 
sealant, just the new head gasket.

3)  Valve seals:  Any tricks here to make this go easier.  Any special 
tools,
    I have a c-type valve spring compressor.

Porsche sells this really nice slap-hammer type tool for removing them. 
 It is extremely useful for the sixteen valve heads because it is 
otherwise very difficult to get access to the stem seals.  You can use 
a socket of the matching size to press new ones on, or there are sporty 
tools that do the same thing.  Porsche wants you to use a Crazy Glue 
product plus activator on the new seals, but I have not found this to 
be necessary.
