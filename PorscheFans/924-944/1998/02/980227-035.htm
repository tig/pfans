	I noticed in the automotion catalog that the rear combination light
lens/cover has a 951. prefix;  Does anyone know if these will bolt up to a
944.  I have a cracked set and think these would look much better than the
stock units.  

	Also, could someone point me to the approximate dates of the
threads on overboosting.

	One more thing, (Am I starting to sound like Columbo?), I have
recently recovered the center console with leather, as well as making a
new shifter boot.  This was VERY EASY,  I have never sewn before, nor do I
have any prior experience with upholstering.  The results are very
professional, and the only cost was material and thread ($10).  The
recovering only took about 25 minutes per item, including cutting,
removal, fitting, and reinstallation.  About as much time as I spend
waxing the car with an orbital buffer.  As a side note, after that I redid
the seats (this was much harder, took about two weeks, but I hand stitched
and replaced the centers with leather and got factory results) --Anyway,
if anyone is interested, I can provide detailed instructions on the
procedures.  I beleive anyone can do it in their spare time.

I can be reached at srbakane@iupui.edu

Thanks in advance
