Gas torches for welding do not belong in automotive body shops, period!  I-CAR and 
Tech-Cor standards for collision repair specify mig welding only.  I can think of only 
one use for a gas torch and that would be for stress relieving during frame 
straightening.  Gas torches should never, never, never be used for any sheet metal in a 
vehicle, and especially so if it is structural metal.  If you are not properly equipped 
& trained then hire the job out to someone who is.  End of story.

p.s  Don't even discuss brazing.  I don't want to hear it!  Gas torches have pushed my 
button ever since I worked a claim (I'm an insurance adjuster) where two people were 
killed who should have easily lived because some idiot brazed structure parts of a car 
together and the parts failed in a subsequent collision.
