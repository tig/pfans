I like to use the following procedure:  First, loosen the old oil filter just
a bit (to make sure you can get it off), then puch a hole in the top with an
ice pick.  This will allow air in so it will drain.  This will remove most,
but not all of the oil remaining in the filter, reducing the spillage.

As to why Porsche designed it that way--who knows?
