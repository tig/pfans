There are those of us with unusually thick cranial bone structures who
could really benefit from seeing every second of the procedure.  Somethings
just aren't easy too visualize from two photos and a text description,
especially for those with minimal prior autmotive repair experience.  As
for text and stills, yes, they can be useful, which is why Haynes sells so
many of their (sometimes worthless) books, and peoplea re willing to shell
out a couple hundred for factory repair manuals.  Maybe it would be a good
venture for list members to create a better-than-Haynes reference, but
personlly I would rather see the video.  Stills can easilly be pulled from
the video at a later time and compiled in whatever format we see fit.

Just my 2/100ths of a USD.
