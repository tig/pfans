I couldn't stand it any longer, I have to know.  I went ahead and
ordered one from PowerHouse today, but I think it will be a little over
a week before I get it.  Autothority is supposed to send it to PH Monday
and when they get it they make the adapter for the K-27 and then send it
to me.

I talked to Autothority this morning and they told me the MFS made most
improvement on top end.  They said the air flow meter could not flow
enough air because of size and restriction of openingc and that the chip
was programmed to pull the boost back down after about 4000 rpm because
the engine could not get the air needed.  They said there would be a
small gain on low end.

David Reins at PowerHaus told me the exact opposite.  He said most of
the gains will be on the low end.  Funny how you get different answers
from people who are supposed to know.  I believe David because his
company has built so many of these engines.

I finally got my K-27 chips installed today.  I'm not sure how much they
helped, the car was very fast before.  I'll know more about how much the
MFS helps.  I finally got the dyno scheduled for Sunday at 2PM.  I'll
get another one after I get the MFS and let everyone know who is right
and if it is really worth installing.  I'll also post the results from
Sunday's dyno as soon as I can.
