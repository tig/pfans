Randall,
        You asked how to adjust your timing belts so you can drive your car to 
someone with the tensioning tool. Fortunately your engine has the spring 
loaded mechanical cam belt tensioner, so your task is greatly simplified. The 
"auto" cam belt tensioner is located below the upper balance shaft, it has a 
roller attached to a spring assembly, two bolts hold it in place. You will 
need to compress it to install the new cam belt, you probably loosened it when 
removing your old belts, I use a lever to compress the assembly, then lightly 
tighten the two bolts holding it in place to keep it in its compressed state. 
Assuming your rollers are clean and in good health, your engine is at TDC for 
#1, install your NEW belts being careful not to kink them or get grease on 
them.  Loosen the two bolts on the "auto" tensioner so as to gradually take up 
the slack and apply tension, then tighten the bolts to 20Nm. Adjust your 
balance shaft belt tension so it feels about the same as the cam belt. I would 
then rotate the engine by hand until you are at TDC for #1 again, and repeat 
the tension procedure by loosening the two bolts, then checking the mobility 
of the "auto" tensioner, then re-torquing the bolts to 20Nm. On our '86 NA 944 
(newer engine with "auto" tensioner), I tensioned as above, never had anyone 
check it with the P9201 tool, and put on close to 20K miles last summer with 
no problems. (I did check the belts a couple of times..).

  You also asked about power steering leaks. Our system was leaking profusely. 
I was able to remove all leaks completely for less than $10. There are two 
problems with the system. 1) The reservoir tank has seams on the nipples from 
casting the tank, and 2) the hose clamps are garbage. I removed the reservoir, 
carefully shaved the seams with an exacto blade, re-installed with new hose 
clamps, and replaced the brass compression washers on the P/S pump. Again, 
close to 20K miles and not a leak! You should also check the O-ring on the 
reservoir cap, it probably needs replacing.

  To de-grease, use an environmentally friendly degreaser product such as 
Simple Green along with paper towels, tooth brushes, etc.. and water to rinse 
up. When I worked on our engine (seals, rollers, belts, etc..), it was the 
cleaning that took most of the time.

Good Luck, if you get stuck, you can give me a call at home:
