                      4th:     6100 rpm   @    133 mph 
 
                      Time to Speed:                   
                       0- 30 mph............   2.0 sec.
                       0- 40 mph............   2.6 sec.

                       0- 60 mph............   5.1 sec.
                       0- 70 mph............   6.3 sec.
                       0- 80 mph............   8.5 sec.
                       0- 90 mph............  10.2 sec.
                       0-100 mph............  12.2 sec.
 
                      Time to Distance:                
                       0- 100 ft............   3.0 sec.

                       0-1320 ft.(1/4 mile).  13.7 sec.
                                          @  103.5 mph 

Take a look at the 1/4 mile figures.  This is for a 300hp, 300ft-lbs of
torque car.  Basically, I took my dyno peak numbers and plugged them in.
We ran 13.9 @ 103.5 and 14.0 @ 102.7, pretty close eh?

Here is the 6-sp info with everything else the same:

                     Number of Gears:            6       
                     Gear Ratio 1st:          3.18 :1    
                     Gear Ratio 2nd:          2.00 :1    
                     Gear Ratio 3rd:          1.44 :1    
                     Gear Ratio 4th:          1.11 :1    
                     Gear Ratio 5th:          0.91 :1    
                     Gear Ratio 6th:          0.78 :1    
                     Final drive ratio:       3.78 :1    

                     Optimum Shift Points:            
                      1st:     6500 rpm   @     40 mph 
                      2nd:     6500 rpm   @     64 mph 
                      3rd:     6440 rpm   @     89 mph 
                      4th:     6320 rpm   @    114 mph 
                      5th:     6200 rpm   @    137 mph 
 
                      Time to Speed:                   
                       0- 30 mph............   2.0 sec.
                       0- 40 mph............   2.6 sec.
                       0- 50 mph............   4.1 sec.
                       0- 60 mph............   5.1 sec.
                       0- 70 mph............   6.9 sec.
                       0- 80 mph............   8.3 sec.
                       0- 90 mph............  10.7 sec.
                       0-100 mph............  12.7 sec.
 
                      Time to Distance:                
                       0- 100 ft............   3.0 sec.
                       0- 500 ft............   7.6 sec.
                       0-1320 ft.(1/4 mile).  13.8 sec.
                                          @  104.8 mph 

The program did give some screwy numbers for top speed.  It gave 157mph
at 6500rpm for the 5-sp and 164mph at 6500rpm for the 6-sp.  I recall
reading that the top speed of the 951(S) is 162mph stock, so I assume
something is wrong with the gearing above or the computer program is 
hooped.

NOTE: This a computer calculated output.  I have not tested any gear
ratios or anything like that, just plugged the 968's numbers into a 
951 engine setup.  I have not personally tested any of this and don't
intend to.  I'll just add enough power to make the gears feel too short :)
