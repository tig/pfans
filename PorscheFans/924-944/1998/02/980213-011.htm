Thanks to everyone who responded with help on my engine cleaning job. 
Gonna try the Simple Green this weekend.

Next question is about my wheels.  I've got an '86 951, Guards Red 
with 16"Fuchs (that's what I assume, from looking at pictures in 
books, and such).  The rims and spokes are non-shiny (annodized?) 
metal, but the area around the cut-out portions is the same color as 
the car, and I'm not real fond of the look.  I've seen the same 
wheels on 911's with the entire inside painted black, and it looks 
pretty cool.  Anyhow, I at least want to paint the red areas 
black,and see how that looks, and then maybe paint the whole insides 
black.  So the question is, what kind of paint to use, and do I need 
to try to get the red off first?  It looks like getting the red off 
might be quite a job, and might screw up the non-painted portions of 
the wheel.  So, any suggestions?

TIA
Jim Crow
I can't stop thinking, talking and dreaming about my car
