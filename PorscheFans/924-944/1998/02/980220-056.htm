As long as this subject has been brought up, I thought this would be a
good time to inform everyone that 10:00am on Sunday, March 8, 1998,
PCA/Chicago Region will hold its 3rd Annual Concours School/Chili
Tasting/Edible Art Contest (FREE) at Napleton Porsche in Elmhurst, IL
(western suburb of Chicago).


The Concours School will be presented by several Chicago Region members
who have concoured (and done very well) at a national level.  As an
added bonus, this year's school will include the following guests:

	"<bold>Larry Emmons</bold> of Emmons CoachWorks, giving product
demonstrations on how to cure a multitude of your car care sins."

	"<bold>Steve Kuchuris</bold> will be demonstrating the proper way to
handle a buffing tool to restore your paint to like-new brilliance."

	"<bold>Stan Chewining</bold> of DentBusters will be demonstrating the
Paintless Dent Removal System that can save you from tears and hundreds
of dollars."


My Midnight Blue Metallic 968 will be one of the demonstration vehicles
(for car care and/or buffing).  If any of you need additional
information or have questions, feel free to e-mail me.

weekend)
