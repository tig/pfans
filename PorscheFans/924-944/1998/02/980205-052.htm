Hi Donovan,
I have had stuck lifters on two of my previous cars - Audi Turbos - and in
both cases the shop mechanic took me aside and told me to take the car home
and to add about half a litre of automatic transmission fluid in with the
oil and to let the car idle (under no load) for 10-15 minutes.  The fluid
is apparently very good as a cleaning agent and will remove any sludge from
the engine.  In both cases my lifters were unstuck.  No more loud clacking
Noise! The mechanic was not allowed to suggest this at the dealer or he
would have lost his job.  They obviously were more inclined to replace
lifters as a good business tactic.  You must drain and change the oil and
filter before you use the car.  Remember you CANNOT drive the car with the
fluid in the crankcase.  

I was told that products like "Forte" or "Lubromoly" engine cleaner can
also be used in this way.  Both of these products have been recommended by
knowledgeable mechanics.

Hope this helps save you some money.
