All -

Someone in the last couple of weeks was asking about oil cosumption in 
the 944 series cars.  I responded directly and said I would report my oil 
consumption as I also thought it was getting quite high on my 944 with 
over 139000 miles.

Well, some initial results are as follows:

		1) around town and very short trips, I find that I use 
		   about a quart of oil for every 250-300 miles.

		2) on longer hauls, like this weekends Porsche tour to 
		   San Simeon and back, I used only 1/3 quart after 
		   almost 700 miles of 65-85 crusining and some short 
		   areas of close to 100. 

Specifics: Use Redline Synthetic 10W-40

I think the around town stuff doesn't allow the engine to heat up enough 
to allow things (clearences) to get to tolerences which might allow more 
oil to be burned up.  Also, the synthetic oil is very thin which would 
allow it to seep out through various gaskets and onto the ground more 
when the car sits frequently.

Any other thoughts?
