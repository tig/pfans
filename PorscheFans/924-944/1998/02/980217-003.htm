Unfortunately, Jay Pineau was killed in a parasailing accident last year.

He was a good guy, the first in the USA to break the PCNA monopoly on
944 waterpumps (I remember when they were only available at $660 each).
I first met Jay at the Cincinnati Porsche Parade, where he was working
the autocross tech line. I proudly pointed out to him the waterpump that
he had rebuilt and had been installed on my car a few years earlier.
The pump is is still installed and working fine...

I don't know if the business will continue or not.
