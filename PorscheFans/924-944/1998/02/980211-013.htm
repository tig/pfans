In an effort to determine the legalities of reproducing Porsche
publications, I am drafting a letter to Porsche to pose a variety of
questions on the subject of copyrights.
This note is to solicit the input of members of the list so that all of our
questions can be answered. I will first send the letter to Porsche Cars
North America and give them the opportunity to reply. If I receive no
definitive answers from PCNA, I will then forward the letter to Stuttgart.
Below are a few of my own questions or questions that have been provided by
other list members. If anyone has additional questions or would like to see
the following questions revised, please provide your input.

1.  Has Porsche considered producing workshop and parts publications in a
format suitable for the personal computer? If so, will they be made
available to the customer?

2.  If a person purchases a microfiche copy of a workshop or parts manual,
can the reproduce printed copies of the material from the microfiche?

3.  Can I, on a non-profit basis, reproduce workshop and parts manuals in a
format suitable for the personal computer and distribute it to Porsche
customers who can prove that they have as a minimum purchased a microfiche
copy of the material they are to receive?

I hesitate to suggest the option of royalties right away.  If it is
perceived that we would be willing to pay a royalty to reproduce this
material, the answer to the above questions would almost certainly be no.

Any input, either positive or negative, is appreciated.


Thank,
Clark Fletcher
