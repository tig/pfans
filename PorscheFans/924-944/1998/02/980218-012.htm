Hello,

> addition, I run 16" R1s (225/50F and 245/45R) on the street full time.
> The problem is that the car's ride is terrible, even with the front

I think you just answered your own question. R1's are NOT known
for their comfortable ride. In fact, they have got to be the WORST
riding tires ever invented! They do work well on the track though.

> causing such a horrible ride (I have been in three 951s with similar

What tires did those cars have? If they had street tires, and you
have R1's, then that's the answer. If those cars are also on R1's,
and your car still has a worse ride, then check alignment, springs,
swaybars, swaybar bushings, control arm bushings, etc.

good luck,
