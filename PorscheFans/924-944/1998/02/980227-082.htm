>I've heard some
people say that you should bring them to the track, drive them for one
run group and take them off for the rest of the event to allow for
rebonding.  Others just say take them out on the street & drive like mad
for awhile.  I know the tire rack has a brief heat cycle article, and
the method they discussed (in addition to the "Tire Rack" heat cycling
process) is driving 100 continuous highway miles.  <


I have a set of Toyo track tires that came with a set of rims I bought. =

They were heat cycled by the P.O.. I do not know what method he used but =
it
didn't do much to increase the wear.  After my first event, I had to have=

them shaved.  After my second event and fireball spin, I have to have the=
m
shaved again.  They were flat spotted big time which was expected but als=
o
the edges showed cupping.   Granted my driving style leaves a bit to be
desired and I am hard on tires.

Last summer we purchased a set of R1s from Skip Carter one of the owners =
of
Trackside Products and PCA-SD past president.  Skip heat cycles his tires=

by baking them in a huge oven (don't try this at home).  Two of us drove
the snot out of the S2 for the second half of the a-x season and the R1s
still look and drive good.  Heat cycling if done properly definately
extends tire life and does not affect them sticking to the track.  =


Skip can be reached at Trackside Prods, (619)281-0200 or FAX 281-5013.  H=
e
can ship or deliver by burro.
