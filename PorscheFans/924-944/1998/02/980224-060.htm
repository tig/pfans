Bring it on!  ;-)

Stock HP is 217 HP *not* 207.  Second, shall we compare Oranges to Oranges?
 Try comparing a chipped 951 to a chipped 964.  Then the 951 will have the
clear advantage.  Third, Farazaan owns an '89 951, so with chips in it it
will easily beat the 964 in HP.

I really don't find the 951 sound to be *that* great.  I'll take a 911 or
even my M3 over the sound of the 951 anyday.

If 0-60 times were everything, we'd all own Mustangs with superchargers.
The 993 beats the 964 with all the little things...  On the track this is
fairly obvious.
