Hey, cool! I think the cloth conversion might be a favorable route to
take. Though the Miami WX is currently in the upper 60's to lower 70's
and some rain, the trademark sun, heat and humidity is lurking around
the corner. I had vinyl seats in my (now wrecked) 80 MGB Anniversary
Edition and may I add that they most definitely did not feel good at
all, especially when the top was down. I will need to conduct a freon
leak check and refill on the A/C system. I think the low pressure switch
is activated to prevent damage to the compressor, since it won't clutch
in but the blower fan goes on. The seat covers I currently have is
exactly that -- seat covers. The elastics allow the covers to move
around too much, especially when I get older passenger who aren't able
to lift their leg over the door sill out to the ground. Instead, they
reel themselves to the side, twisting my seat covers in the process and
undoing the anchors (I hate it when the anchors break!) and lift their
legs up and out. Sometimes they'd even twist the floor mats crooked.
Since they are senior to me, I bite my tongue and hold my respect for my
elders. I just fix the items shifted back to my liking at my next
convenience. Anyway, I most sincerely appreciate you sharing w/ me of
what you did and I will look into getting my seats reupholstered soon.
Thanks very much.
