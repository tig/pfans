I just got off the phone with the Porsche Customer Commitment Hotline and I
think I am now just about ready to be commited.

Can anyone tell me whether a 1979 model 931 transaxle and tube will fit into
my 1980 model?

The girl on the PCCH seemed floored by my questions.  When I assured her that
I had previously talked to someone else there about this and that they needed
my VIN to check on compatabilities, she started to loosen up a bit.  She
took my VIN and quickly told me what I already knew, that I have a G31/02
transaxle, which I believe is the same thing as a 016/Z.  However, she balked 
when I told her I was wanting to use a tranny from a 1979 924 turbo.  Her 
response was, "They don't exist!"  After some prompting she found that the 1979 
model 924 turbo was sold in Europe and that the transmission type for the 1979 
was shown as G31/02 in one place and G31.01 in another.  When I brought up the
question of the tube and bellhousing, she admitted she could not answer my 
question and said it was a question for their technical hotline.  Problem is, 
she could not give me the number for this tech hotline.  It's a service offered 
to dealers for a fee and is not made public.

I think I remember hearing (or reading) that the US 5-speed version of the 924 
NA for 1979 had the same tranny as the 5-speed 924 and 931 in 1980.  I suspect 
the european 5-speed 931 in 1979 has the same tranny also.  The $64,000 
question is, are the torque tubes also the same?  In the back of my mind I also
seem to recall some discussion about stronger gears in the turbo application.

Any info on this would be greatly appreciated.  Please also send a copy of your
response to "bro@hpcc.epa.gov" as I only get the digest.

Thanks in advance.
