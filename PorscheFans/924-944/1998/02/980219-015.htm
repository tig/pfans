Hello Clark,

The important thing is to be able to blip the throttle while braking.
It doesn't really matter how you do it, as long as you do it.  The
'standard' practice of using the ball of your foot on the brake and the
heel of your foot on the throttle is because the braking is more
important than the blipping. Since you typically brake with the ball of
your foot, continuing to do that when heel - toeing is easier for most
people to learn. However, as noted, people come in different sizes,
cars have different pedal arrangements, etc. As long as you can
continue to use max braking as you blip the throttle, you are
heel-toeing just fine.

If you have access to some sort of data aquisition system (like a G
analyst) you can see how good you are at heel - toeing. The data
recorded for braking force should not change when the car is
downshifted. Last time I recorded data, at Bridgehampton. I saw that I
lost a little braking force when I downshifted. I was not able to
maintain full braking when blipping the throttle. Something for me to
work on.

One final comment about shoes. If you look at race boots, you'll
see that most of them continue the sole of the right boot up onto
the right side of the foot. Hmmm, I wonder why they do that?
