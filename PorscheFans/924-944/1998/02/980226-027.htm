My question was whether one could consider the 944 a true Porsche
but not the 928.  The biggest difference between the 924 and 944
was the engine, which was basically half a 928 engine, right?

No, the 928 never sold in huge numbers, and the if the current
resale value is any indication, it still has a relatively small
(but extremely passionate!) following, myself included.  We 928
owners are constantly torn between being puzzled that our cars
aren't worth more and delighted that we can afford to buy such
a wonderful car for so little.

Isn't this somewhat true of 924s and 944s as well?  I still can't
believe how little I paid for my 944, and when I think about the
price/performance ratio for a 944 turbo, the only reason I can
think of for not owning one already is that I don't have anyplace
to park it... yet.
