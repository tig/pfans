I was the original author of this article, and did the modification on my
car.  The chime will not sound, as no modification was made to that part
of the circuit. The relay is switched from terminal 15, meaning the fog
lights will go off with the key.. thus no chime, and no battery drain. 

If you choose to give the relay constant power (terminal 30) you are on 
your own. The chime will not see the modification, and your battery will 
run flat if you forget and leave your fog lights on via the dash switch.
