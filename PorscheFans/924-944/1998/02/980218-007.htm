>how come they never seem to be able to CLOSE the door... not slam it?  Hah!
It's funny you should mention about slamming doors. Many passengers do
this practically all the time. By the time you attempt to say
"....Don't sl...." it's too late. Then they turn to you slowly with
some sheepish, toothy grin and a slanted, head angle with the intent to
say "....sorry...". Man, I tell ya! 

>Anyone out there have a recommendation for seat covers for a 83 NA 944? As
for your seat covers, I guess it all depends on how much you wanna
spend. I bought my 83 944na w/ vinyl seats. Though the seats follow to
what appears to be the original stitching pattern, I'm debating if they
were ever original. There's nothing on my option code sticker that
mentions any of the sort. And, oh did I mention that the two front
seats have many tears at the lower seat backs? Guess when I have more
pennies accumulated in my "piggy bank", I'll reupholster them. Then,
there's that blasted center cassette console arm rest thingy. I don't
have any broken hinges but actually it's the top itself. The cover's
vinyl covering is torn as well as distorted. The screws won't stay in.
Instead of having a hinge replacement kit, it ought to be the hinge and
cover!!! How does any 944 owner w/ the older interior expect to do a
proper restoration? Hmmmm, the world may never know.
