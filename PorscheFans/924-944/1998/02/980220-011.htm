You can also buy racing shoes at any racing supply store. They are very
supple and soft, and fit your feet like a glove.  Some of them have the
tread wrap around the outside of your foot so you can just roll your foot
between the brake and gas pedals with no edge to get in the way.  Like any
special purpose shoes, you don't wear them anywhere except in your car. 

At racing supply stores you can also find brake and gas pedal plates to
modify the layout of the pedals to fit your feet.  You want to get the
pedals as close to level as you can.  

Finally, the only way to learn heel and toe is to practice, practice,
practice!  You can practice everywhere you go, even from a stop.  I have a
note taped to the top of my steering wheel that says "HEEL AND TOE."  My
instructors have told me there is no way to drive a track well until heel
and toeing becomes instinctual.  It's not that hard once you realize that
the point is simply to keep the engine revved up so you don't drop rpm's
and then have to make up the time on the other side of the turn.  No big
mystery.  

I don't mean to imply that I'm good at it, but it sure is fun to practice!
It's like a holiday on your way to work.
