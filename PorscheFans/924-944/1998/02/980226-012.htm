I was wondering if anyone is running 18" wheels on their 951 out
there?  I remember seeing an article on a 951 in European Car many
years ago that was running 8.5X18 and 9.5X18 Anteras (yuck!) with
235/40f and 265/35r tires.  I plan on keeping my set of 16" R1s for
the track.

In addition, in reading the "Re:  Powerhaus parts" posts lately, I
wanted to let the group know my experiences and varying successes with
upgrades.  I originally modified my stock 951 (in one single upgrade)
with the K-27T6, APE chips, gutted cat, lightened flywheel, and carbon
fibre/kevlar clutch.  The car felt dead(!) until about 3000 rpms or so
and then had an absolutely wicked top end.  The weak bottom-end may be
due to the high miles on my motor.  To compensate, I installed the
short gears from a 1990 944S2.  This helped get the car on boost
"faster" but due to the gearing, probably hurt my performance after
60mph as the car would benefit from a longer gear and less shifting. 
To compensate for this, I replaced the K-27 with a K-26S and ordered
the Mass Air kit from Powerhaus.  What a difference!!!!!!!!!  The car
has near instantaneous boost and will light up the R1s (on the street,
in cold weather) in all of first and second gear and part of third.  I
am now craving the longer gears as well as considering moving up to
the K-27DR.

Contrary to some of the statements I've heard (and obviously a matter
of personal preference), I love the sound of the rush of air into the
Mass Air's cone filter and the whistling sound from the blow-off valve
when you let off the gas!!

Sorry about the sidetrack but my experience with Powerhaus has been
that they very professional and knowledgable and immediately willing
to correct any problems (they originally sent the wrong Mass Air chips
but overnighted a set the same day).  In addition, Todd Zuccone left
Powerhaus some time ago to open up Zuc's Performance which, although
concentrating more on 911s, has stolen a lot of the business from
Powerhaus and typically offers very competetive prices.  He can be
reached at 602/816-4362 (typical disclaimer, this is not an
endorsement of either Powerhaus or Zuc's... yadda-yadda-yadda).
