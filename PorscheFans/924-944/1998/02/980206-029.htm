>The most reliable way to check the alignment of the balance
shafts is 
to
>remove the sprockets. The spockets are aligned with the engine
set to 
TDC.
>With the engine set at TDC, the woodruff key slots on both
balance 
shafts
>should face up(12 o'clock position). The balance shaft drive
gears

----I understood everything up to here, I don´t understand what
the drive gear is, is the sprocket not the drive gear??------ 

 
>each have two grooves for the woodruff key. One groove has an "O"
stamped beside
>it and the other has a "U" stamped beside it. For the upper
balance 
shaft,
>the drive gear is installed with the "O" groove on the woodruff
key. 
the
>lower is installed with the "U" groove on the woodruff key.
>
> If you don't have a timing belt tool or a spanner for the
sprockets, 
take
>a heavy piece of wire and slide it into each of the grooves on
the
>sprocket. Obviously, the groove with the least penetration is
where the
>woodruff key is. 

----Also, I did not understand all this about the spanner and
having to 
slide pieces of wires?? I have had the belt spanned already, my
mechanic 
has a good "Feel", if that is what you are referring to.


----And lastly, was is a "woodruff key"??


Thank you.
