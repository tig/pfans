My '87 944 has the factory-style wheel locks and of course, no key.  What is
the best way to remove these locks?  Can Porsche cut me a new key from the
VIN number?

Once I have those pesky wheel locks off, what is the correct procedure for
adjusting the front wheel bearings?  I remember reading something about
being able to turn the thrust washer behind the adjusting nut, but I don't
remember the exact procedure.

My rack-and-pinion leaks at the pinion shaft seal.  I am planning to fix
this when I do my engine mounts, have any of you ever had to replace this
seal, and if so, any advice?

And last, but certainly not least, can anyone offer tips on dismantling a
transaxle?  Special tools, special procedures?  When I changed my gear oil,
I found pieces of a bearing.  The previous owner had been driving the car
with a broken clutch center, and I suspect the shock to the drivetrain "ate"
the bearing.  Now the transaxle works fine, is a little stiff to shift, and
makes some noise, mostly a whine, and sometimes chattering noises at low
speed, while trying to creep forward, I.E. let the clutch out a little,
start moving forward, push the clutch back in, transaxle goes
chatter-chatter-chatter...  I'd like to replace the bearing and save the
transaxle as everything else about it seems O.K.
