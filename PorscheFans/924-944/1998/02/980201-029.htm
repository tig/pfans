Pfans,

I ran some numbers today to check the gears ratio numbers published in the
December 1992 issue of Excellence. I found some additional misprints from
the article. Specifically, the overall ratios for the 1987 944 Turbo in 1st
and 2nd  gears were incorrect. I have corrected those plus the errors that
Tom Pultz found and am providing a reprint of the ratios below.  I think we
must realize that top speed numbers can be very deceiving since they
are based on the red line for the individual model and the stock tire size
for that model. In order to get a more representative comparison of the
different gear sets and ring and pinions, I calculated some "theoretical"
top speeds using the same RPM and same tire size for each gear set. The
944/968 series has used a number of different tire sizes. I decided to go
with the 225/50VR16 (which gives a circumference of  78.1 inches). 
Additionally, I decided to use 6400 RPM to calculate the "theoretical" top
speeds. The only number that looks really suspicious to me is the 5th gear
for the early 944. It looks way too low and yields a theoretical top speed
that seems way out of line with the other cars. If anyone has different
numbers for these gear sets please let me know.

1992 968 (Final Drive 3.778 : 1)
1st  Gear:          3.182       12.02 : 1     35 MPH      39 MPH
2nd Gear:          2.000         7.56 : 1     60 MPH      62 MPH
3rd Gear:           1.435         5.42 : 1     80 MPH      87 MPH

6th Gear:             .778         2.93 : 1    156 MPH    161 MPH

Interestingly, if you were to combine the 944 Turbo ring and pinion with
the 968 gear set a theoretical top speed of 180 mph would be obtained. If
anyone finds any errors in these calculations or has any question about
them, please let me know.

Hope this helps,
Clark Fletcher
