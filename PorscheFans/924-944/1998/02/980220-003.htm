Hey guys sorry about the late post but have a few comments on rear fogs.  I
personally dont think my Porsche needs any more brake lights, the ones it has
are excelent.  also as far as schematics on them havent had a chance to look
but from experience here is what I know.  BOTH rear fogs come on  on every
Porsche car I have seen some models have an extra switch for rear fogs others
have a 3 position switch ( off-fog-fog and rear fog) never seen them come on
in conjunction with front fogs.  Just my .02 cents worth    <Lived in Germany

ROW cars turn on the left rear fog lamp when the front fogs are on, except
Japan where it is the right one. Only one rear fog is lit. I bet that the
wire is hot when the front fog is on if you check it with a meter. But you
might have to put a relay or fuse in the front box.
