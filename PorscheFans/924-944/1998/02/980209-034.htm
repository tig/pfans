I had recently purchased an alarm system for the Porsche(Mine does not have
the standard factory install).  Once I had the the system in hand I went to
find a shop to install it.  I have installed a few systems in some other
cars but would prefer to have some professionals do it in this case.  To my
surprise I could not find a shop willing to do it.  So I decided to go
ahead and do it myself.  Unfortunately the first thing I tackled was the
remote lock/unlock function of the alarm.  The workshop manual does not
even cover the wiring of the power door locks.  Is there anybody out there
with the information I would need.  What I am looking for is the following:

1)   What type of door lock system is it...
                        3 wire positive grounded
                        3 wire negative grounded    or
                        5 wire pulse/switched.

2)  The switch in the console has 4 wires but only 2 are used for the lock
and unlock functions.  Of the 4 wires  I can follow 3 to the brain/control
unit.  At the brain there are 11 wires connected (3 from the switch, 5 that
I managed to follow to the door switches and last 3 go of to never, never
land,...I think since I don't have the wiring diagram).  Does anybody have
the Info to tell me what is going on here?

From there it was pretty easy to install the function to close the windows
and sunroof when the alarm is armed etc etc but the doors are a stumper.  I
have a 88 Porsche 944 Turbo.

Thanks and regards
Leon
