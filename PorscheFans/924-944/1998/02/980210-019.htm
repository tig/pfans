Leon:

Here is a repost of that procedure:
> Porsche 944 Foglight modification. Original poster was: Gregor email: g=
sdiseth@efn.org
>=20
> I wrote a mini article distilled from a Panorama piece back in June.  I=
 dug through my pile of diskettes and recovered the post. See below.
>=20
> There is an article in the February 1997 issue of Panorama article re: =
Porsche electrical systems, and in particular, how to modify the fog ligh=
ts to operate independently of the headlights.  I decided to tackle this =
and I took notes as I went along. =20
> =20
> I just walked in from the garage after completing the modification.  Ve=
ry easy.  It took less than an hour and I didn't have to take apart the c=
entral electric board!  I will post my little mini procedure below, disti=
lled from the Panorama article.  Take a look at it if you have a
> copy.. however these instructions should be thorough. See the article s=
hould your car not conform to what I have described.=20
> =20
> There are many reasons to perform this modification.  In the US (and po=
ssibly other countries as well) the fog lights are disabled when the head=
lights are off or on high beam.  First, I want to run the fog lights as '=
daytime running lights' without having the parking lights and the dash il=
lumination on all the time.  Second, on a deserted highway at night, I wa=
nt to run the fog lights with the high beams for added lighting.=20
> =20
> Here is the procedure.  I did this on my '89 NA 944.  This should apply=
 to most '85/2 and on cars.  Please take the usual precautions - disconne=
ct battery negative cable, etc.
> =20
> 1.	Unclip and remove the central electric panel cover.
> =20
> 	2.	Unplug and remove the G6 bridge adaptor (it looks like a really sho=
rt  relay, only about =BD inch tall).  The part number stamped on mine is=
  944.610.183.06.  The label inside of the central electric panel cover l=
abels it as 'G6 spare links' although the Panorama article refers to it a=
s a 'bridge adaptor.'  Do not confuse it with G19, which is called an 'al=
arm bridge adaptor' according to the label.
> =20
> 3.	Open the G6 adapter.  Mine has a plastic cover.  I just spread the b=
ase enough with my fingernails to allow the bakelite base with the contac=
ts sticking out to come free.  If yours has a metal cover or otherwise di=
ffers from my description, well, use your ingenuity to open it. ;-)=20
> Be careful when you remove the cover, or all of the connectors will fal=
l out, and you will have created a puzzle.  Guess who did that :-)  Stick=
 bits of tape on the connector spades to keep=20
> them in place, if desired. The insides of the G6 adaptor are very simpl=
e.  Just a few links between
> spades, and two diodes.  Draw yourself a diagram of the interior so you=
 can put things back to stock should you get cold feet during the procedu=
re or want to restore the car to original.  Or you can buy a new G6 adapt=
er.
> =20
> 4.	Here is the actual modification.  The spade on the G6 adapter you ar=
e interested in is #9.  It is soldered at the junction between the two di=
odes.  You need to desolder and remove the spade.  Be sure to leave the t=
wo diodes connected. Or, if you do not solder, you can just cut or bend o=
ff the spade.  If you cut off the spade, put a piece of  black electrical=
 tape over the vacated spot to prevent shorts.
> =20
> Briefly, what you are actually doing (should you be wondering) is disco=
nnecting the relay coil voltage source (from the headlight low beam power=
) to the fog light switch, and replacing it with a terminal 15 source, so=
 your foglights operate independently of the lights, and switch
> off with the ignition.=20
> =20
> 5.	Almost done.  Look where G6 used to be plugged in.  You will see eac=
h slot that accepts the spades are numbered.  Strip a 4 inch piece of wir=
e on each end, and insert one end into <slot #9> on the central electric =
board.  This corresponds to the #9 spade you removed from the G6   module=
..  You will want to stick a short spade in with the wire so it makes firm=
 contact, but leave the top of the socket as flush as possible.  You will=
 be plugging G6 back in over the top of the wire you just inserted.  The =
other end goes under a fuse leg (nearest the center of the fuse panel, so=
 the wire is actually fused).  This should be terminal 15 or X, so your f=
oglights will shut off with the key.  I chose fuse 25, which is heated se=
ats (which does not exist on my car - unused circuit).  I would not pick =
a sensitive circuit, like anything for the DME, instruments, radio, etc.,=
 just to be on the safe side.  However, the draw needed by the coil in th=
e fog light relay is very tiny, just a fraction of an ampere, so don't wo=
rry. Please be sure there is no exposed bare wire when you are done, and =
that there are no stray strands that could potentially cause a short!
> =20
> 6.	Carefully plug the G6 adapter back into the central electric panel (=
over the wire you inserted into slot 9).  Reconnect the battery negative,=
 and get your keys!
> =20
> Testing:
> =20
> A.	With the key in the RUN position (dash lights on) you should be able=
 to flash the fog lights with the high beam stalk (original flash to pass=
 function with headlights retracted, parking lights OFF).
> =20
> B.	[New function] The fog lights should turn on with the switch, with t=
he headlights and parking lights OFF (daytime running light mode, if desi=
red).
> =20
> C.	Fog lights should work with the low (dipped) beams on, like usual.
> =20
> D.	[New function] Fog lights should work with the high beams on.
> =20
> E.	With fog lights ON, they should switch OFF with the key.
> =20
> That's it!  The procedure is really easier than it looks.  E-mail me if=
 you note an error, or with any questions should you get stuck. =20
> =20
> Disclaimer:  I am not liable for potential damage caused to your car if=
 you use this procedure.=20
