My 944 NA is a euro spec 1988 model and I am now unsure whether I have an
anti-knock sensor!
One Pfan said that only Turbos had them but I'm sure the 944S and S2 had
them. The  PCGB 944 technical advisor thought it did have one. Where would
the sensor located?

My car only pinks under heavy acceleration and only if I use 97 octane
(leaded). It is fine with 98 octane unleaded.
