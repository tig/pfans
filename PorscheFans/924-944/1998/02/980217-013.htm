Michael,
      Water pumps are just like any other mass produced item you buy.
Sometimes you get a good one, sometimes you get a bad one. The point is,
while your rebuilt pump has lasted much longer than your original, that
isn't always true. I know three different Porsche repair shop owners in
three different locations (NJ, NC, SC), and all three prefer new water
pumps over rebuilt. Each has experienced a larger number of premature
failures with rebuilt pumps than with original ones.  At one shop, the
owner received (on more than one occasion) rebuilt water pumps that did not
last 10,000 miles.  Having said that, I will also say that it is becoming
increasingly difficult to find original water pumps.  As a result, I plan
on using rebuilt pumps in the future but, I intend to buy them from a
supplier I know and trust. Hopefully, I won't experience similar problems.
Thanks for sharing your experience. By the way, from whom did you get your
rebuilt pump?

TIA,
Clark Fletcher
