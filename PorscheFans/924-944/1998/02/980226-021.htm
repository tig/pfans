Casey,

It sounds like you are dealing with a very honest 924 seller.  I have had a
1980 924 turbo for over ten years and would have to say that it is not in its
best element on city streets or stop and go traffic.  I guess it depends on the
type of driving you do every day.  I relied on mine as a daily driver for about
5 years and it was trying at times, but the long distance trips made it all 
worth it.

I never owned a normally aspirated (NA) 924, but I did drive a few before I 
bought my 924 turbo (a.k.a., 931).  I found the 924 NA to be underpowered and
somehow a bit more rattly than the 931 that I eventually bought.  However, 
there are a lot more EXPENSIVE parts to maintain on the 931.  A friend once
said to me "Babes can't tell the difference, so what's the use of a 931?"
He obviously was not a car guy.

All 924s suffer from some under-engineered interior mechanicals like the
heater controls, speedometer, etc., and I gather that 944s are not that much
different.  But you don't buy a Porsche for the knobs inside.  Drive the 931,
take her thru some twisties at maybe just a bit over the speed limit posted
to protect the lower percentiles of the public, then point her toward a distant
location and start getting there quickly, smoothly and efficiently, and I bet
you'll buy the car.  Be prepared to turn a wrench occasionally and shell out
some bucks to a trusted mechanic when you have to.  But most of all, have fun.

When it stops being fun and too expensive to maintain, take her apart and sell
the pieces to me. :-)
