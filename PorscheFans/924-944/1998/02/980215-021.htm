I have noticed one big change in people's reactions since getting my 944.
When I drove my rather aged Nissan, I was usually the first off the line at
a green light, and everyone else would just take off at a nice, slow
comfortable speed.  But in my 944, leaving the line at about the same
speed, everyone seems to feel the need to go faster.  From Jeeps to Chevy
Vans to other old Nissan Sentra drivers.

I rather think that the actual difference is the super lame performance of
a 944NA off the line...

in a "nice, slow comfortable"  casual start (shift around 3200rpm), as you
describe, almost any crummy four door passenger car with an automatic
transmission will jump the line on a 944... I mean, you can dig and roll to
4500 or 5000rpm, but then you're no longer casual...

my favorite trick is to roll a 3200rpm 1-2 shift to signal that I'm not
racing anybody, then pull a 4000rpm 2-3 shift, and well, I think we all
know what happens next... I just love third gear in a turn... the mental
effect they feel of being on the brakes while I pull away and vanish around
a corner is far more devastating than what I feel when I lose by a length
off the line...

Maximas, Lexus, Jeeps, BMWs all have decent low end grunt to deal with
their inherent largeness, but this largeness leaves 'em dead when the
smiles rack up the quickest...

take a jab, knock them out...

if you want to see truly hilarious, get on a motorcycle, and notice people
in cars wanting to race you...
