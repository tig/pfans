For those of you who have been following the ups and downs of my 2.95
stroker turbo engine rebuild, it is update time.  For those who have
questioned my absense from the list for the last two months, my list of
excuses are as follows:   My computer went south (big time), I went way
south of the border twice for most of January and my engine builder's
contractor went south on the shop expansion project.  On the plus side, i=
n
December, I finished my rookie autocross year in the S2 with a few of the=

semi-fast guys starting to look over their shoulders.  Also there isn't a=
n
orange cone that doesn't cringe when my name is mentioned.

When my computer melted down, the data recovery bandits wanted between $6=
00
to $1000 to recover my files (backup? don't ask).  One of the crooks had
the nerve to ask for $195 to reformat the drive and reload Windows
(probably an ex Andial employee).  Give me a break!  Although my list fil=
es
were gold, for that kind of money, they can stay in never never land. =


At the end of December, my engine builder and I finally work out a rebuil=
d
schedule ("I'll start on your engine the first of the year") a minor
problem arises.  The general contractor that was going to do his shop
expansion bails out on him.   A little 20' high dividing wall has to come=

down, a 600 sq ft loft has to be built, a second lift put in and his new
lathe and new gonzo mega amp TIG welder installed.  He starts paying rent=

on the adjoining space in two weeks so panic sets in.  Like a fool, I had=

mentioned that I would trade him some labor if he needed help on the
building project.   He asks my help, I consider his time constraint and
open negotiations.  I state that the logic of a one man shop having two
lifts eludes me.  The extra lift should be dedicated to my car, he
reluctantly agrees.  Negotiations end and work begins.  Right off the bat=
,
my engine builder hits his thumb with my favorite framing hammer.  Instan=
t
role reversal, I am now the master.  =


Not wanting to be bothered by annoying building permits, inspectors or
engineering plans, Mr. Unlicenced Contractor will work at night and on
weekends with the doors closed.  As with most of my construction projects=
,
the job takes three times longer than I had estimated.  In a blur of roto=

hammers, screwguns and demo saws the wall comes down, the loft goes up an=
d
the equipment is installed.  Suspecting that the "light stuff" he claims
will be stored on the loft really consists of heads, cranks and assorted
tons of metal, I build the loft with 2 x 10 joists on 12" centers.  My
builder can store one of his Vettes on the loft if he can get it up the
stairs.  =


The customer with the 57 Chevy Nomad, that is having an IROC frame and
engine spliced on, comes in.  He is pleased that I hadn't dropped the wal=
l
on his car and that the engine builder and I haven't killed each other.  =
He
sees the new lift and has hopes of driving his car by summer.  I point ou=
t
that my car has priority on the lift.  His eyes glaze over when it sinks =
in
that there is little chance that he will still be young enough to drive t=
he
Nomad when it is finally finished.

Once again we draw up a battle plan for finishing my engine.  At long las=
t
it looks like we have all the answers and parts.  The stock turbo intake
manifold is a compromise between good design and room under the hood.  As=

it stands, the number four cylinder runs too lean (too hot) due to poor
manifold design.  Having cooked off two head gaskets and one piston in #4=

cylinder, I should be the poster boy for challenged intake manifolds.  My=

manifold has been chopped apart on the milling machine, the intake runner=
s
shortened and a plenem box built.  Instead of spending my time pounding o=
n
the computer keyboard, I should be out fitting a clear plastic window to
the top of the plenum box.  This is so the smoke air flow to each of the
runners can be observed on the flow bench.  Once the flow is equal to eac=
h
cylinder, an aluminum panel will be TIG welded over the window hole.

The fuel flow and ignition problems will be addressed with a programable
system from Racetech.  The local rice burner builder has built some kille=
r
non-exploding engines using the Racetech system so we go with his
recommendation.   A custom chip could be burned for the DME but it would =
be
a shot in the dark.  With all the variables, programable is the only way =
to
go. The larger deplacement requires more fuel hence larger injectors.  We=

decide on Bosch 403 injectors.  The flow rate is about right and I can't
bring myself to use Lucas even though their flow rate is a better match. =

My experience with a Triumph TR6 cramed with crapo Lucas parts is not
forgotten.  A pox on Lucas.  An adjustable fuel pressure requlator on eac=
h
end of the fuel rail will supply even pressure to each injector.

By increasing the stroke, a pressure wave is created in the oil pan.  Thi=
s
wave forces the oil up the cylinder walls.  When this happens, two things=

may occur.  The oil pickup may become uncovered and the #2 rod bearing ma=
y
be spun or oil gets sucked through the breather tube into the turbo
compressor throught the innercooler and into the cylinders.  The oil has =
a
counter prodective effect on the $4 per gallon racing fuel thus causing
detonation.  The solution to this is to drill holes between the cylinder
webs to releave the pressure.  My builder's idea of a crankcase evacuatio=
n
line to the exhaust created negative crankcase pressure but did not solve=

the oil in the manifold problem.  We had considered drilling holes during=

the first rebuild but were concerned with weakening the block.  John Joes=
ph
researched this and found a racer that had been running a drilled stroker=

block on the track for several years.  =


We will be running an aftermarket wastegate, blowoff valve, HKS boost
controller and a 911 turbo fuel pump.  The MSD multispark portion of the
MSD ignition/boost package is the only thing that is staying.  Allthough =
I
have not tried the Magnacore sparkplug wires yet, I am convinced that the=
y
are the way to go and have bought a set.   From personal experience the
Nology wires are only good for tying shut garbage bags and emptying your
wallet.

The turbo is still a question mark, Garrett is a possibility.  Opinions a=
re
welcome.

Next week the triggers on the flywheel are being repositioned for the
Racetech ignition.  The J&E pistons are being hone fitted to the liners a=
s
we speak.  Project Fireball is finally moving forward again. The lust for=

engine building has once again raised its head.

I was once told that the first page of the Engine Builders Bible said
something to the effect of once you stray from stock, reliability becomes=
 a
thing of the past.  That is why I have to have two P cars, one to
experiment  with and one to drive.
