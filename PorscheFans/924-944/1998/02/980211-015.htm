Barry,

I see where you were coming from -- everything else did look like it might
be more at home at the Oshkosh experimental air show by comparison!! It was
amazing to see one on the track again and I hope they do try and compete at
Sebring so we can see them again. It does make you think though -- well, if
I just... nah, that's crazy!!

And yes, when it comes to the 911 ranks there are some very serious cars at
lowly DE events here as well. My favorite was a brand new 911 GT2 fresh from
the factory. However, none sound as well endowed as the ones you mentioned
from out east. I guess it just amazes me to think of the incredible amount
of time and money that goes into those cars and then to be regulars at DE's.

I bet you could sell seats on the bridge next time that 911 tries to knock
it down. What an incredible rush that must have been.
