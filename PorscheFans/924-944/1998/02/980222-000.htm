Jeff,

look at the boost hose that goes to your intercooler.  the one that
snakes in an S above your air cleaner.  Reach under it to the left of
the strap holding it to the air cleaner and see if when the lat time
someone replaced your waterpump/thermostat they left the hose clamp
screw at the top.  If so, chances are it has rubbed a hole in the boost
hose.  This is fairly common on the 951's with a less than perfect shop.


Also the cycle valve "blow off valve" can go bad over time and reduce
boost.  

In either event, A qualified mechanic would be able to notice either of
these as opposed to just say it doesn't seem as strong as other cars ;-)




[Subject: '86 951 boost

Hi all

I'm hoping that someone will be able to point me in the right direction
with a problem I've got with my '86 951.

On full throttle the maximum boost that shows on the gauge is 1.6 bar.
I'm led to believe 
that it should boost to 1.8 bar.  Firstly is it correct that I should be
getting 1.8 ? and if so
what could cause the loss in boost pressure ?  My mechanic says that the
car doesn't feel as strong 
as other 951 '86 that he's driven so its unlikely to be that gauge.

I was wondering if it could be the wastegate has gone 'soft'.  I've had
the car for 6 months and 17,000 miles
and its always only boosted to 1.6.

Help


Regards
