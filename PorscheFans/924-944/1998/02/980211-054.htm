Just FYI:

The latest 951(S) control arm part numbers are as follows:

944.341.927.031
944.341.928.031

These numbers supercede the old numbers:

951.341.027.031
951.341.028.031

My shop has not been able to get 944.341.927.031, so they called all over
the place including Germany and were told that they would have to use
951.341.027.031 until the parts supply runs out, then they would start
shipping the new 944.etc unit.

By visually looking at the new control arm, I did side-by-side comparisons.
This is what I noticed:

- the new arm has "webbing" I guess to make it stronger
- larger buildup of aluminum around the ball joint
- larger buildup of aluminum around the anti-roll bar mounting hole
- anti-roll bar mounting hole is enlarged on new unit
- the ball joint bottom is larger and hangs below the control arm hole (hard
  to describe;  the 951 unit sits flush at the bottom)

Otherwise, the dimensions are the same.  The new unit is stamped as a 1997
manufacture, the 951 part has a 1988 stamp.

Anyways, hope the mismatch parts don't affect the car in any way.

I'm still waiting for his 951 to return from the doctor.  I've got a Grand
Jeep Cherokee Laredo as a rental car.  Pretty nice truck, steering is
made up of rubber bands that attach steering column to tie-rod ends :)

I'm not getting grumpy here, but can people using new and high tech
email readers please take the time to understand how the software works
and to shut off HTML coding and any other funky extensions, as it becomes
very hard to read on the web interface and in the digest.  Perhaps take
a few minutes to check it out on the web interface and see if your email
is coming out goobered.  As I said, it doesn't really bother me, but I've
had to skip a message about a topic I would have liked to read because it's
filled with "@&html&$$&email&%%&sucks%##&really@@%bad@%" kind of things.
