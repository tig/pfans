The oil-level warning light only comes on on starting.
When there's not enough oil in your motor, a floating device will sensor
this and turn the light on. The sensor electronics can only be reset by
shutting down the car for about 2 minutes, thus off contact.
I had this intermittend fault a while ago. The floating device was
defect. However, don't buy a new one immediate. They can be repared.
For those who are interested: I've made a drawing of the sensor. Send me
an email and I'll return the GIF file directly to you.
Easy to repair, at almost no cost (only a new gasket).

At the top of the sensor, there is a soldered joint. A reedcontact
(magnetically powered contact) is soldered to there.
Now, when you're driving your car you get good vibes, huh?
These exact same vibrations loosen the reedswitch from the joint. (This
takes years to happen.) Therefore this fault only occurs when the engine
is hot. Mind: the oil-level has no effect on this particular event
(unless it is beneath 1/4 between high and low level).
A good sensor only lights up the frightened dash light when the oillevel
is at 1/4 between high and low level or lower.
When the engine is hot, everithing is slightly bigger. Heat expands
materials, some famous person discovered that a long time ago.
The gap between the reedcontact-pin and the solder is also bigger. The
chance is greatest that the both do not contact when the gap is biggest.

As said before, when the engine is cold, there is no problem. When the
engine is hot, the fault could occur.
I know, the note of exclamation makes you nervous. It did make me
nervous.

So, if you suffer by this thing:
Remove the sensor (while changing oil). Desolder the top of the sensor
(use a tin-sucker!). The solder it again. Since there is relative a lot
of metal to the joint, you need a high power soldering iron.
Replace the sensor using a new gasket (cost about $4 original part, but
saves your heart).

Now you have an accurate low oil level reading.

Good luck.
