Jim,
    The factory coating on our 15" 5-spoke fuchs was as follows: The "rim" was 
painted silver and clear coated, the "spokes" were painted with semi-gloss 
black. It is possible the "rims" were anodized, but since they were clear 
coated, I doubt it.. Last summer after being damaged by a tire shop, I had 
them re-finished at Rennsport. However, I am now in the process of 
re-finishing them as the polished "rims" developed some slight pitting from 
salt that collected from those occasional drives in the winter(I am using 
buffing wheels with different compounds to do this). I was actually surprised 
that Rennsport didn't protect the finish better (yes I had waxed them several 
times).

   When painting, I find it best to strip all the way down to metal. I don't 
like the look of thick paint layers. I have used automotive paint reducer 
(thinner) to remove paint by applying the thinner to paper towels and 
scrubbing the paint off. Make sure you wear a charcoal mask to protect your 
nervous system from those nasty fumes (well worth the $30->$40 investment) and 
strip the work outdoors. I use thick black rubber gloves to protect my hands. 
If you only want to re-finish the spokes, you will have to protect the "rim" 
section so you don't damage that area while stripping the "spokes". If you 
apply thin coats of a high quality paint from a spray can, and let the 
coatings dry between applications, a very nice finish can be achieved.

Good Luck!
 Ezra
