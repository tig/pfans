Several threads on rough idle prompts me to suggest three
easy-to-check-and-test possibilities.  In general, the problem can probably
only be isolated by troubleshooting the entire ignition and fuel injection
system. But then, again, the problem might lie elsewhere.
 In the past, I have occasionally found a loose or leaking vacuum line.
On two occasions, a spark plug wire was faulty.  The resistance of the wire
was high when cold and low when warm.
A third possibility, often overlooked, I ran across in Probst's manual of
Bosch Fuel Injection (thanks for the reference to this book to Doug H.)  The
substance is this:  Rough idle can be caused by one fuel injector clogging
so that the cylinder runs lean.  The lambda sensor compensates by enriching
the mixture for all cylinders and the car runs rough.  Without pulling the
injectors, one can suspect this is the cause from noting (1) the engine
fails an emission test or (2) fuel economy falls up to 25% or (3) the owner
uses low-detergent fuels with high carbon content and has been driving for
short periods (at least 15 min) and parking for 45 min or more.  (The fuel
on the tip of the injector breaks down and causes the deposit).
