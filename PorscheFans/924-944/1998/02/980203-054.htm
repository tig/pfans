Thanks a lot, Bruce Anderson!  I've had my '88 Turbo S on the market for
several months now and no one has made me an offer lower than my $13,000
asking price until today!  The guy told me he'd just read the article,
but, funny thing, when I talked to him a week ago, $13,000 seemed to be
OK with him.  No, my car's not in "excellent" condition, but I just
can't afford to take less than that.  Besides, I'm convinced that,
considering the performance, these cars can't be worth less than $10,000
if they're in decent condition.  I personally believe that the market is
artificially low because of all the non-Porsche people buying these
cars, finding out how much proper maintenance costs, and then selling
them at bargain-basement prices just to get rid of them.  I've met too
many people who weren't Porsche enthusiasts and bought these cars new,
to think otherwise.  A lot of 944s, especially the turbos, are being
converted to track cars, so hopefully as the supply of streetable cars
goes down, the prices will go back up.  I think I'll do my part in
reducing the supply by putting mine up on jack stands in my basement and
telling anyone that expresses an interest in it to take a hike (probably
not, I'm just in a foul mood right now).
