Hi all,

  I am grinning now because I just picked up my new ride, an '87
951 with ABS and the performance handling package, Weltmeister 
Stage 2, Indischrot.  It has 85,000 miles and was most recently 
owned by a Porsche mechanic.  I just wrecked my '83 944 one week 
ago today on wet grating on a bridge.  There is *definitely* a
difference between the two.  Unfortunately it was a letdown from
the car I drove earlier in the day, which was an '87 951 as well.
It had *much* more boost...but that was because when I took it
in for the pre-purchase inspection they told me the wastegate 
wasn't working!  The oil cooler was held in place by a nylon
cable tie, and the control arms and bushing needed replacing.
But boy, did it go!  One of the mechanics asked how much they
wanted for it and offered me his at the same price ($9,000), 
which is the one I picked up in perfect condition, except the 
right front fender needs to be replaced.

  So, if anyone knows where to get a right front fender cheap,
please let me know.  I can get one retail for $500.

  If anyone in the Oregon area has been wondering about the
951 that Berg Car Co. has been advertising in the Oregonian,
stay away from it.  They have had it since the summer and should
have it forever unless they drop the price to $5k or so.  It
died on me on the freeway when I sustained 5000 RPM for a few
seconds.  Since the battery was dead from sitting so long and 
didn't have enough juice to start again, I popped the clutch to 
get it running again on the off-ramp.
  
  Does anyone know if the Mass Flow sensor passes environmental
regulations in Oregon?  Apparently it passes the sniffer test, 
but if they know about the sensor they won't let you through?

  Lastly, I still have my wrecked '83.  The wheel is buckled in 
at the top, about 25-30 degrees.  The fender is smashed in, the
lower spoiler and the piece that holds the badge is also smashed
in.  The nosepiece with the bumper on it is ok structurally, 
though the paint is scraped.  Underneath the control arms look
OK, but the part that comes from the top of the wheel well (don't
know the name for it) that holds the wheel is bent.  Any guesses
as to how much all of this will cost to fix?  Aren't these all
bolt-on parts (except if the arms are hosed, of course)?

Thanks!
