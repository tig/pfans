Another suggestion is to check edmunds (http://www.edmunds.com).  They also
list used car prices.  I have used KBB before, sometimes they are "correct"
sometimes they are off by a good amount.  I have also heard complaints that
their wholesale prices are too low, and their retail prices are too high.

One suggestion is to key out the vehicle in Kelly Blue Book, www.kbb.com/ ,
according to zip code, accessories, etc. In SC, for example, it would sell
for under $3K.

Subject: RE:  Rough running

Gary,
    When you say you replaced the injector relay, do you mean the DME
relay? The reason I ask is because those are classic symptoms of a DME
relay failing. If you did replace the DME relay, I would next try cleaning
the contacts on the throttle position switch. Although I doubt is that is
the problem it's a quick and easy check. I sounds like your DME control
unit could be failing but, unless your mechanic has a spare, you don't
won't to buy one and later find out that isn't the problem. There are
several other problems that could cause this including a bad crank position
or reference sensor. I've even seen the ignition switches cause similar
problems. A bad head temperature sensor can cause the car to run rough but,
shouldn't keep it from starting. Based on your symptoms, I believe the two
most likely causes are the DME relay or the DME control unit itself. Keep
us posted.

Good Luck,
Clark Fletcher

Clark,

I appreciate the feedback, but I am a little bit confused.  I had the
impression that all 944 water pumps these days, even from ther dealer were
rebuilt.  I did not have the chance to call the dealer and ask for the
part to check prices.  I will feel a lot better if there do exist new
pumps, I felt robbed when the shop mentioned $280 for what I thought was
a rebuilt pump.

This would imply that the later 88 turbo S only benefitted from the 247 hp

the Turbo S goodies (suspension, brakes, etc).  The only difference between
the silver rose cars and the other Turbo S models was int/ext colors and the

Subject: Turbo waterpump always running

Hi All;

It's been a long while since I have been on the list.  It's good to be
back!

Now I have a problem with my 1989 944 Turbo.  This morning the battery
was dead when I tried to start it up.  After getting it started and
returning from a short drive, I noticed the Turbo waterpump continued to
run longer than 30 seconds.  I stopped it by removing the fuse.  When I
reinstalled the fuse the pump did not start running again.  I think this
is what caused the battery to run down in the first place.

Any ideas how to fix this?  The car had been sitting since last Sunday.
The only stupid thing I have done lately is clean the engine with a
pressure washer.  I tried to be careful about where I sprayed, but I may
have gotten something wet that is now shorting out causing the pump to
continue running.

Please reply directly to wtmeyer@erols.com.  Thanks in advance.

Menenaos and all,

The reman pump I just had installed cost $150 and I thought that was a
bit much.  The shop (Porsche specialists) said they only used Porsche
remanufactured water pumps???  I was happy with the job until I screwed
up about 400 miles later (yesterdays 'Trouble" post).  I feel better
about the price I paid now!  If I can set it up with the mechanic, I may
have a bearing replacement video to contribute to the video project.

Here in the Los Angeles South Bay area, I'd wager to say almost 2/3 of the
944 drivers I've seen are women.  911 is still primarily men, though.  But,
no offense meant to women 944 drivers here, take one of my female coworkers
for example.  She came in to work a couple months ago saying she bought a
944.  I'm like, "Awesome!  Turbo or normally aspirated?"  I got a blank
look and a "Huh?" in response.  Right then she should have turned over her
keys to me and walked away in shame. :)

I too have not received any second looks from the fairer sex in my
excellent condition 944.  Sad thing is, there's so many of them out here.
Porsches that is.  Well, and the women too.  I see more 911's than Camaros
every day.  Back when I lived in Michigan and was looking to buy a 951, my
girlfriend and her friends were all oohing and ahhing over it.  Out here
it's mroe like "Oh, you own one too?" or "Why don't you put lots of VTEC
stickers, bright blue driving lights, a 8" polished exhaust tip, and 2"
wheel spacers on it?  Oh, and give the wheel 10degrees of camber."  I
thought the dark window tint the PO had was bad enough.

So Roxy, if you happen to have any 20-something friends in Southern
California that can appriciate a great car kept in great shape, I'm
accepting phone numbers. ;)

I have noticed one big change in people's reactions since getting my 944.
When I drove my rather aged Nissan, I was usually the first off the line at
a green light, and everyone else would just take off at a nice, slow
comfortable speed.  But in my 944, leaving the line at about the same
speed, everyone seems to feel the need to go faster.  From Jeeps to Chevy
Vans to other old Nissan Sentra drivers.

There are indeed new pumps available, and I wouldn't recommend anything
but.  The Porsche pump rebuilding program tends to yeild poor results (on
the other hand, I've never heard or ahd a problem with Merced-Benz rebuilt
pumps), building pumps with very short life spans.  Some rebuilders may do
a great job, granted, but there's no way of really knowing if your pump is
one of the good ones.

As for the price...  I don't know if this is average or not, but I jsut got
a quote on a new water pump for my 85.5 944: $400.  Still, $280 might be a
little high for a rebuilt.  Although Performance Products sells rebuilts
for $129.50.  What confuses me is they say an additional core charge of
$100 will be refunded upon return of your old pump....  I can't imagine
their pumps end up being only 29.50, so that $129.50 figure is probably
AFTER core return.  And remember that if oyu have an older 944 (pre-1986 I
beleive) that has not had a pump replaced since 86 (again, I'm winging it,
don't remember for sure), you will need a water pump update kit for the
newest pumps to fit.  I believe the kits run about $60.

I would also like to find a source of an inexpensive O2 sensor for my 944S.
I'm not about to pay the dealers price of $180.  An ad in the Excellence
magazine lists Bosh sensors for $30 (1 wire universal ) and $69 ( 3 wire) from
GERMAN PARTS AND RESTORATION  (gprmail@fix.net--- Phone # 800 -321-5432  ).  I
have never replaced my O2 sensor in 167,000 mi. and just think if the price
were right it may be a good maintenance thing to do.  There was also  a thread
a while back about someone using an inexpensive Mustang O2 sensor on his
Porsche.  Don't know the outcome of that though.

The CV joint bolts use a 6mm triple square bolt head.

Porsche 944s do not take kindly to too many burnouts.  Clutch, transaxle,

CV joints tend to fail as a result. (My conclusion, let them beat you off
the line, catch them in the corners...)

You probably haven't broken the splines on the halfshaft, more likely have
broken the ring and pinion...

Subject: Water Pump World

I would appreciate hearing from anyone with opinions on water pump replacements.

I just received a water pump from a mail order outfit, that shall remain
nameless, that offered a rebuilt pump, but the part was an outdated style
(944.106.124.1R as marked on the casting) and it still has the guard rail.
The problem is the thermostat mounting is offset from the new version by 2.5
mm and the new thermostat will not fit.  Is the old thermostat still available?

The date casting is stamped 86 28 which I assume is the 28th week of 1986.
However, the Tech Bulletin #1 states that July 1986 was the start date of the
new style water pump on Porsche engines.

I am leaning toward returning the pump and buying a brand new one as the price
is only $70 more and I can't imagine any benefits with a rebuilt pump.
Certainly, any monetary benefits have evaporated with the need to return the
pump I have now, not to mention that both garage bays are, once again, filled
up with one car that doesn't run.

I was dating my girlfriend before I purchased my 944.  In fact she was with
me when I test drove the car.  She knew that that I had been looking for
over 6 months for just the right one.  At first, she thought the car was
nice looking & a good value.  After a few months she got jealous of all of
the time I spent on the car, not to mention how much I talked about it.

Then winter came.  I stopped driving the car for a few months.  Instead I
was driving my Pontiac Grand Am (nice, but not a Porsche).  One day she
confessed to me in the car, "I miss the 944, I feel alot safer in it."  I
agree, the brakes, suspension and acceleration do make it a "safer" car to
drive.

She understands that I plan to always own at least one Porsche.  In fact,
she has even expressed her willingness to own a 914, you know, the "cute
Porsche".

Takes a few little tricks with pulling the door inthe right direction while
fidgeting with the handle to get it open.  I have the door panel off right
now and was looking at the latching mechanism.  The door handle lever just
isn't forcing the bar attached to the latch down enough.  Maybe 2mm more
would get the latch to release as it should.  What's the easiest way to
adjust this?

Funny, a flashlight would help me a lot.  I moved here 4 months ago and
still haven't figure out which box I packed it in.

Also, on the other door, the window seems to change speeds a few times
while it's going down.  Bad motor probably?  Both windows are dreadfully
slow as it is, at least comapred to my previous cars, is that normal?

Sorry to hear about what you found out.  I would think that the car has
been licensed in a state other than yours if your title does not say
salvage/rebuild.  Unfortunately, title procedures are not the same in all
states and what qualifies as a salvage/rebuild title in one state may not
in another.  I know that doesn't ease your pain any but if you are planning
on keeping the car for awhile, make it your baby and try to find out as
much as about what was done to get the vehicle back into a saleable state
after it was totalled.  That way you can at least know what isn't
"original" on it and also know of possible potential problems with it in
the future.

Once again, sorry for your bad news.

Subject: A/C and overheating problem

Dear Fans:
        I have not used my A/C for a couple months (a no-no according to
the Manual) because of a broken switch on the climate control panel. Last
week, I put in another unit. Using the A/C today, the temperature gauge
gradually rose from the lower white mark, which is where it is anchored
most of the time, nearly to the higher white hashmark.   At the time I was
travelling in moderate traffic at about 45 mph and the temp. was showing no
signs of going down--maybe rising a bit, so I turned off the A/C system.
The temperature gauge returned to normal in a couple minutes.
        Reading the FAQ, I wonder if the 2nd A/C fan is not turning on, or
if the relays are really screwed up and the fans are shutting down when I
turn on the A/C. I'll go out to my car and turn on the A/C while the beast
is still warm and see if the fans go on. Any other ideas would be
appreciated.

Khal Spencer

Subject: Nippondenso a/c

a/c clutch will not engage at any control setting. Clutch will engage if
12V is jumpered to it. Seem to have narrowed problem down to Nippondenso
amplifier (077300-0320). Inputs to amplifier change as a/c controls are
moved and I can hear a relay closing inside the amplifier when a/c is
turned on.  But, I do not know what the actual inputs should be. There is
no output to the clutch at any control setting. Low pressure switch,
condenser and evap fans working okay. Continuity from amplifier (blk/wht
lead) to clutch okay.

Does anyone know how to test this amplifier? What about a source for a
schematic or wiring diagram for the amplifier?

I don't use my 944 to attract women--my wife hates it when I date!  I will
say, however, that here in the Pacific Northwest, we have numerous women P-
fans, of which my wife is one.  She and I have autocrossed both a 911and a 944
for the past several years.  I think it has made us both way better drivers,
and on at least one occasion she thinks her auto-x experience saved her from a
serious freeway accident when her Honda began aquaplaning.  She also attends
DE days, but hasn't yet been convinced to drive.  I run at SIR, and it's
pretty scary there if you screw up.  We are planning to attend a Jim Russell
school together this summer, though, so maybe she'll get over her timidity.

Bottom line:  if you want your significant other to get intersted in the P-
car, buy her a helmet, point the car at some cones, and tell her there's
absolutely no way to hurt the car.  It worked for me--now she's as hooked as I
am.

By the way  Farzaan:  I'm very sorry to hear of your bad experience getting
your car repaired.  Best of luck in your dealings with the shop--give 'em
hell!

Bill, the 'deeper knock' you describe could be the #2 connecting rod
bearing.  I had this happen during a driver's ed.  You can replace them by
dropping the oil pan.  Hopefully you haven't spun a bearing.  As for the
loud tick, usually this indicates a hydraulic lifter noise.  Lifter
replacement involves removing the cam shaft carrier.  You will need the cam
belt tensioning tool if you decide to do this one.

Subject: negative report on Zims

   Hey P-fans,
      I wanted to share my most recent learning experience. I have been
replacing my front end in my 1985.5 NA,( steering rack tie rods, struts) and
needed the passenger-side conrol arm (a-arm) , the late aluminium  one . I
checked all the usual sources , ads in Excellence, Tweeks, Auto Alanta, etc.
and called Zims. Their ad said  $129 exchange, with rebuildable core charge of
$150. On the phone was quoted  $199 exchange, same core charge. The part
arrived quickly, looked good, and had been fitted with a grease zert fitting.
So far , so good.
The problem arose upon the return of my core. Instead of $ 150 credit they
gave me 50 dollars because they claimed the bushings needed replacing in my
core.
If  my part was good, I wouldn't  have replaced it! I feel like Zims charged
me  for something that they would have had to do anyway. I would asume that a
reconditioned a-arm would automatically include a new ball joint and new
bushings.
If it is Zims practice to sell remanufactored parts with used bushings I would
think the list should know about this. If on the other hand they charge you
for your new bushings and charge you for new ones in your core, this is
deceptive practice. A company that will decieve in on instance probably will
in others. Either their safety and quality are suspect or their eithics are. I
won't use them again and would caution others not to either.
By the way, the other guys who rebuild these things, i forget their name, but
they are in Houston, Texas  are selling them for $179  or $199, installed! I
got their ad 2 days after I ordered from Zims.
Oh , Well at least my car handles well. The Lone Star  Region PCA auto-X is
tomorrow but we have a 80% chance of rain ! Bummer....

Hello Chris & P-fans


        The explanation point ( ! ) only comes on when one of the warning monito
ring
circuits is triggered. Turn the ignition key to the on position, all of the
lit warning lights that come, can trigger a explanation point ( ! )  light.
        Circiuts that are monitored are things like: Brake pad wear, brake fluid
level, parking brake is left on, coolant temp too high (or bad/loose
connection), ABS, airbags, oil pressure, battery volatge/charging.
        Of course check what you were messing around with just before the light
came
on! Start tugging and see what happens.

        As far as I know there is no way to read or access which circiut has the
problem. I would check things like parking brake wire(s) next to drivers seat.
Also the brake pad wear  might also be a good place to look for wear or loose
connection.

Good Luck, Davidjalai@aol.com

Subject: Blue Headlights

I saw the thread some time ago about the new Blue headlights.  Has anyone
tried the Blue Ion bulbs from Auto Atlanta?  I understand that there is
more to the blue healights in the new cars than the bulb but....

I know nothing about the Auto Atlanta headlights (as I do not have the
catalog).  From what I know, the true blue lights require a high voltage
AC system and the package costs between several hunderds of USD.  The
system generates lots of RFI so it requires extensive shielding, plus of
course a place to install it.  You are correct, there is more to it than
the bulb. MB offers it as an option in the C class I think, I wonder if a
visit to that dealership will be educational.

Does anyone have a written procedure for bleeding brake lines on a 951?
