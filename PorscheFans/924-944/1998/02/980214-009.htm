<< What actually occurred (at least to the best of my knowledge) was that the
 original silver rose/burgundy plaid models were truly a limited edition
 (1000 copies) to celebrate the '87 Euro Turbo Cup car.  At that time, the
 factory was still shipping the 217hp version of the standard turbo.  They
 discontinued the manufacturing of the 217hp engine, and when those supplies
 were exhausted, they began shipping all turbos with the 247hp (S) engine in
 the standard interior/exterior colors >>

This would imply that the later 88 turbo S only benefitted from the 247 hp
motor.  In fact, those cars (I have one of the 51 in maraschino red) have all
the Turbo S goodies (suspension, brakes, etc).  The only difference between
the silver rose cars and the other Turbo S models was int/ext colors and the
way luxury options were packaged.
