Hello Chris & P-fans


	The explanation point ( ! ) only comes on when one of the warning monitoring
circuits is triggered. Turn the ignition key to the on position, all of the
lit warning lights that come, can trigger a explanation point ( ! )  light. 
	Circiuts that are monitored are things like: Brake pad wear, brake fluid
level, parking brake is left on, coolant temp too high (or bad/loose
connection), ABS, airbags, oil pressure, battery volatge/charging. 
	Of course check what you were messing around with just before the light came
on! Start tugging and see what happens. 

	As far as I know there is no way to read or access which circiut has the
problem. I would check things like parking brake wire(s) next to drivers seat.
Also the brake pad wear  might also be a good place to look for wear or loose
connection. 

Good Luck, Davidjalai@aol.com

Subject: Exclamation point lights up, help!

I have an 87' porsche 944 turbo.  I pulled the fuse to the dash lights
yesterday while the car was running and put it back in.  I also yanked a
bit on a wire behind the fuse box.  Now when I turn the car on the
exclamation point, air bag, and seatbelt lights stay lit.  I
disconnected the negataive battery cable (with car off) for 5 mins or so
and the light still stays on.  I have the turbo addendum shop manual and
can't find anything on that light.  Anyone know what will cause this or
how to shut it off.

I also noticed a vacuum hose unplugged and put it back in.  It did no
good...
