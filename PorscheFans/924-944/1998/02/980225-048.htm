Yep, I made my own too from a broken lens but intact fog reflectors.

I instead used the factory installed Daytime Running Light relay (on my
1991 at least) but not hooked up in the USA models. The driving light now
is my DRL and I didn't need to add a seperate switch. This way other 944
owners scratch there head when I pass them by, wondering how I have
driving lights on without the headlights or parking lights on.

When I put my system together, I did'nt find any existing connector for
the driving lights.
