I cant help thinking that until your motor is developing in excess of
375 hp with a corresponding amount of torque this is rather a pointless
question. An unsympathetic driver could destroy a  951 box with the
stock 217 hp. The people claiming this ( I recall seeing something on
Windward's web site ) don't state what exactly will break. You can sheer
teeth with almost no horse power if you drive like a fool but destroying
a pinion is probably a result of poor power transmission than too much
power. Ask anyone who has broken a pinion in a NA 944 after driving on a
clutch with a worn out rubber damper. The torsion diff in later 968's is
simply a "better" way of getting power to the ground rather than giving
the transaxle any more strength. I must point out that I never did
gearbox 101 so please consider my comments those of a lay person.

I've heard that the 951 transaxle can only withstand about 375 hp
without
breaking.  What about the 968 6-speed, particularly the 94 and 95 with
the
torsion differential?
