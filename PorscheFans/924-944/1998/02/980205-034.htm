Wrong. If you are doing 80mph in 5th gear you will see 3k RPM in a 944
and a lower RPM in a 944S, not higher. If you saw a higher RPM in the
944S for the same (5th) gear and speed as the 944, it would end up with
a lower top speed (given the same 6.5k RPM redline). See the FAQ -- the
944S has an 11mph higher rated top speed over the 944.

You are also confusing the term "taller" with a higher drive ratio. In
fact it works exactly in reverse. The "taller" a car is geared, the
lower the drive ratio drops, and conversely the "shorter" gears of an
early 944 give it a higher drive ratio. The "shorter" and "taller"
simply refer to the physical dimensions of the gears. So the 944S is
geared "taller" than the early 8v 944, and consequently has a lower
final drive ratio and a higher top speed.

If you can make any 944 (8v or 16v) engine "flatten out" you deserve a
lot of respect! Have you ever driven a 2,670lb (the 16v and later 944s
weigh in at ~3,000lb) 8v 944 with the 1:3.89 box, on the track? There is
no "flattening out" until you are past 125mph and holding on for dear
life. No turbo lag, no 16v sluggishness, just continuous, smooth power
all the way from 2k-6.5k RPM in every gear.

Don't get me wrong, this is no F-50! No turbo rush, and a "limited" top
speed if you have the skill and courage to go faster than 130mph on any
kind of track or auto-x in a street car. But Porsche did not put the
shorter gear-set in the early 8v 944 without good reason. I am sure the
16v 944 is quieter on the highway, although I didn't think so. It
probably is more fuel efficient with the taller gears (although it is
heavier). It certainly has a higher top speed.

But to claim that the 16v car is more spirited is incorrect. That is
exactly where it is lacking, and whether you take it above 4k RPM or up
to 6.5k RPM you will still see an early 8v 944 pass you with ease, at
anything less than 110mph. Go to a local SCCA Solo event or a PCA
time-trial and compare the times between an early 8v and a 16v.

Having said all that Patrick, any example of an early 8v car you can
find will be 13-15 yrs old. The 16v car will be newer. Much more likely
for you to find a low-mileage, well cared-for 16v car than a similar 8v
car with the 1:3.89 box('83-'85). But if you do find one I would grab
it. 

1983-85 was a time when the 944 was a sensation at the Geneva show, the
first water-cooled car since the 240Z to excite enthusiasts all over the
world. It was pronounced (with the "sport" package) the best-handling
street car in the world in several road tests. Many of the early 8v cars
were ordered with the "sport" option including Bilsteins, bigger
springs, thicker sway-bars, 7J and 8J Fuchs, the 14" 4-spoke wheel and a
limited slip. People who bought it tended to be enthusiasts who cared
more for performance than stereos or hood badges (although two months
ago Road & Track(?) said the '83 944 is one of the 10 most drop-dead
beautiful cars in the world!). If you can find a single-owner,
low-mileage (60-90k mi) early 944 you will have a truly historic,
simple, reliable and fun car -- good luck!
