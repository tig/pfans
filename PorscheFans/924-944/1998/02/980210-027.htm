Recently my 17 year old son's 87 924S (no I'm not accepting applications 
for more children) started developing intermittent electrical problems.  
When we first bought the car the AC controls would stop working sometimes, 
mostly due to a blown 25 amp fuse. Two weeks ago the radiator fans 
wouldn't come on, so I replaced the thermo switch on the radiator.  
Problem solved.  Last Friday night, all at once, the radiator fans stopped 
working, the headlights would not come up or on, the AC would not turn on, 
the fresh air fans would not run. This time fuses look ok.  Where the AC 
fuse attaches in the fuse block, there is evidence that it has been hot 
before.  The same is true of the other fuse block, on I believe #5 fuse.  
I understand this is not uncommon for the AC fuse.  I wired in a temporary 
toggle switch for the radiator fans so the car could be driven during the 
day. Yesterday, the headlight, AC fans, fresh air fans miracously healed 
themselves. I suspect the radiator fans have too, but I still have the 
normal wiring bypassed on them.  Any ideas out there?  In addition, does 
anyone know if there is a specific repair book for the '87 924S other than 
the factory manuals, especially the electronics, or is the wiring diagram 
for the 84-85 in the 944 Haynes manual correct?
