My wife (version 1.0) was looking through one of those kid clothes magazine 
and found an interesting car seat.  It is a padded back with a five point 
harness on the front.  There is no bottom to it so the child's butt 
actually rests on the seat.  The unit is held in place by the original 
seatbelt it appears.  Don't know that I will try one just because I am a 
stickler about the interior and usually small kids (mine at least) mean 
large spills.

Info: The catalog is called "Sensational Beginnings" Spring 98; phone 
800-444-2147; 987 Stewart Road, Monroe, MI, 48162.
The unit is made by COSCO and it is called a "Travel Vest".  Item number is 
K935X (in this catalog) and it sells for $39.95.

Good Luck!
