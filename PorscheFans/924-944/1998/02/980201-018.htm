Hello everyone,

       I just completed the belt and rollor change. After starting the
engine (heart pumping very heard) I was checking for engine vibration.
At idle I do have vibration,but at high rpm's vibration is gone. This
is same as before the belt change. It seem that I need motor mounts.
When I looked at the mounts I noticed that the nuts were missing on
the passenger side and were on the mount on the driver side. My
question is did the mount collapse and the nuts fell off or is the
mount threaded and the bolts do not have the said nuts. It looks like
I cound not get the nuts in now, not enough room. Most pictures I have
looked at in the manual show the nuts. But I am the Second or third
owner. I do not know if the mount has been changed before. Thx
