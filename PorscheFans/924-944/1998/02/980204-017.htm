I have long debated about whether to install MAF on my 951. I'm currently
working on a 2.8L engine to go in my car and will have it ready to install
soon. Consequently, I will be forced to make a decision about MAF in the
very near future. I don't really want to go to the trouble and expense of
having the current chips remapped for the 2.8L and then turn around and
replace then down the road if I decide to go with MAF.

From everyone I've talk to and everything I've read, most people seem to
think the MAF doesn't make that noticeable a difference in the horsepower
of the car.  However, those same people believe it does make a big
difference in the throttle response (as John pointed out).

From people who race prep 944s for a living, the one thing you hear over
and over is that as you increase the displacement of these engines toward
3.0L, the limiting factors are the capability of the fuel management system
and the limit on the amount of air that the stock intake system will pass.
Consequently, anything you can do to reduce the restriction of flow in the
intake improves the overall performance. (i.e., get rid of the flapper box,
larger throttle bodies, extrude honing).

Also, while it is true that the injectors are based on volumetric flow, the
potential for errors in the fuel/air mixture due to changes in specific
gravity and fuel temperature are significantly less than the errors
produced by changes in air density with changing temperature (which is the
main reason you do see MAF systems around and why you don't see any MFF
(Mass Fuel Flow) kits).

So, the real question is this ---  Is the cost of a MAF system justified by
the increase in performance?  My answer is -- for a stock displacement
street driven car ---- no way ---- for a street driven, autocrossed stroker
engine ---- maybe ---- for a full blow club racer --- definitely.  It's
like they say,  "Speed costs, how fast do you want to go?"

Just my two cents,
Clark Fletcher
