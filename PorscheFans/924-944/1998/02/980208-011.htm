I have an '87 944 turbo that I am basically very pleased with.  However,
it seems to be just a little noisy on the highway-particularly from the
rear of the car.  I suspect it is just tire noise/lack of sound
insulation (with the rear tires so close behind the driver). I am near
the point of needing new rear tires, so can anyone recommend a "quiet"
Z- rated tire to replace my Dunlop D-40M2s?   I don't mind sacrificing a
little grip(wet or dry) if necessary.  FYI, I am also running yellow
Koni shocks. Will these cause more noise to be transmitted?  How about
adding sound insulation (Dynamt, etc.)?  I don't want to turn it into a
Cadillac, but I think it would be more pleasant as a daily driver. 
Also, has anybody swapped in a 968 motor to gain low-end torque (at the
obvious sacrifice to top-end power-I am currently running an'89S
turbocharger and APE mass-flow package, among other minor mods)?
