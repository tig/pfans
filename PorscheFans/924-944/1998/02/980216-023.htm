Hi all!

I just read a stack of email and was noticing the thread from
falcon@wolfenet.com (Tom Pultz) about tri electrode bosch plugs.

I have toyed with the idea of trying them for awhile, since my fiancee's VW
Fox (which has been (ahem) turboed for 150,000 miles, ask Vaughn Scott, he
knows) uses the WR7DTC plug from the factory, believe it or not.  We have
always been good and replaced them faithfully.  

Other than stating the obvious and admitting that I should go to a range or
two cooler plug with the turbo motor in the VW, why did you switch to the
higher heat range (WR7) from the original WR5 that was in your car? (I am
of course, assuming that 5 is a cooler range than 7, which may get me the
"GONG," but I like living 'on-the-edge').

Also, on this porsche's and women thread- 
in my limited
dirty-blond-crewcut-25ish-revo-wearing-american-male-without-baseball-cap
experience in upstate NY and Massachusetts I have noticed approximately 1/3
of the P-car operators (911 and 944 but not 928) are female and like to
wave and that I get noticed most by the 40+ women in lincolns (with or
without their kids) and the bleach-blond teens in the passenger seats of
5.0 mustangs; the above not being without a certain merit, I am on my
second black stickerless (factory or otherwise) fairly low-key 944 and am
just as happy when 95% of the people out there have no idea what it is [as
I am passing them]. Of course, the acknowledgement from the 5% of the
population that is clued in is all the better this way.....

85.5 NA in a box kit
88 944S
90 VW 'Thunderfox' <---- also very low key, no stickers, aluminum rims or
nuthin'

PS- anybody out there have a set of 4 point or pseudo four points that they
would like to rid themselves of...?
