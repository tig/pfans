Hello P-Fans=0A=09My =9186 owners manual says to use GL-5!!!!! I am using=
 SWEPCO 80/90wt in my=0Atrans/diff. The SWEPCO fluid shifts fine hot, and=
 is "slightly" notchy when=0Acold but I can live with that. Since I just =
overhauled my trans last year I am=0Anot taking any chances, and will alw=
ays use the SWPECO for added peace of mind=0Aand protection. =0A=0A=09I w=
as using the Porsche fluid G-50 (rated GL-4), @35/liter!  VW & Audi also=
=0Ause this stuff as a factory fill oil. Great shifting when cold! Also m=
akes=0Ashifting easier in general. But since it has a rating of GL-4, I b=
elieve that=0Ain the Porsche trans this will cause problems over time. =
=0A=0A=09I have also use Mobil-1 (rated GL-5) in the trans/diff. I did no=
t like it=0Abecause the shifting effort was VERY hard when the fluid was =
cold! I do like=0Aother Mobil-1 products but not their trans stuff! =0A=
=0A=09I also have use BG products "Syncro-Shift" (rated GL-4, for front w=
heel drive=0Acars). The "Syncro-Shift" had great shifting feel, and seeme=
d to relieve some=0Aof the worn syncros before my rebuild. But since it w=
as designed for FWD AND=0AGL-4, I do not think it is worth while in this =
application. =0A=0A=09My advise would be to use what has universally been=
 accepted (by P-experts)=0Aas one of the best trans fluids: SWEPCO. I wou=
