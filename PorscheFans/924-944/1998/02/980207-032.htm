<< Thanks to Q Moola for the tip on using Auto Tranny Fluid to un-stick
 my noisy lifter problem.  I will be giving this a try over the weekend
 if I have the time, and will let the list know how it goes.  Clark
 mentioned that someone had also recommended using ATF in the fuel tank
 to clean the system, has anyone else ever heard of this?  >>

Donovan,

I can't believe you guys have never heard of this before . . . . . maybe
you're just too young!!!!!!  This is an OLD trick that has been around for
ages.  We used to do this all the time on our cars in the 50's and 60's
(mostly Detroit iron hot rods, etc.).  I've also used it on some rice-burner
engines successfully but I've just never used it on the Porsche (maybe I've
just been too scared).  ATF is super-high-detergent oil and it really can
clean an engine out.
