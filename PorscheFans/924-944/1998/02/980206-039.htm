>A question for any electrical/stereo guys on the list, my system (all
>aftermarket) has developed a high-pitched whining sound which rises
>and falls with engine RPM.  Any ideas?

Typically caused by bad or insufficient grounding. You can never have a =
good enough ground for car stereo equipment. Look for the closest piece =
of significant metal to ground the equipment to. The bigger the =
grounding cable the better and don't rely on the factory ground in the =
harness. There is an awful lot of electrical noise generated in a car =
and the the equipment can act as a antenna if not grounded well. Finding =
the right ground attachment can be a trail and error process, don't =
reinstall everything until you have tested it with the engine running.

Have Fun
