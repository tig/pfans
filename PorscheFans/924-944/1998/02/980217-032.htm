While I can't comment on a dash cover for 85.5+ models, I did do a 924 once
that has the same dash as Chucks '83 944.

Since I was replacing a PO attempt to install one, it became obvious when
mine arrived in the mail that there are different models from different
suppliers. I replaced a Coverlay that fit bad and didn't totally surround
the instrument pod, with a dash cover from Tweaks. It was styled better,
fit better and even had a better finish. Can't say that Tweaks uses the
same supplier for all models however. 

The point is, not all dash covers are the same. Probably most need
improvement.

The installation is critical as well. Do not start until you have trial
fitted with wedges at the windshield and weights (I emptied my *huge* penny
jar into Ziplock bags).

Any black plastic finish can be improved with a can of Satin finish spray
color from a professional auto trim shop. I do not endorse similar products
from your local BillyBob Speed 'n Sport.
