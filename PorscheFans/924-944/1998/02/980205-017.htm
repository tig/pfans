Hi Todd,
   We - Brey Krause- were one of the sponsors of the #58 car 
amoung others.  It was entered and built by Al Broadfoot of 
Technical Demensions.  The guys had a ball and actually placed 
10th in GT-2 in the prize money.  It was a hoot and we had alot 
of fun backing them.
   The car was built in 11 days and had a few teething 
problems.  When they got to the track, they had not slept in 2 
days.  They still had smiles on their faces all weekend.  It is 
fun to work with people like that.
   The car will be back better than ever.  Look for it at 
Sebring.

Good Luck,
Dodge
.
