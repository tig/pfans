>Hard to say if your original Koni's were factory installed as part of a
M474 package or if they were installed by dealer as replacements for the
original Boge's. Even when these cars came original with Koni (on the cars
with rebuildable struts) the fronts still would have been a Koni insert into

side of the equation and somehow gets transferred to the 944. I won't
confuse you with the 911 stuff unless you want to know.
