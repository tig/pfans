With regards to yesterdays post about fitting missles to 924 models.
We (our then watercooled PORSCHE Club) looked into the possibility of
fitting roof rack mounted launchers to our 924 models to allow them
toast any air-cooled cars that tried to burn them off. Using cheap
leftover Eastern bloc ordinance the project looked extremly viable. The
technical side of the conversion did not pose a problem. We had plenty
of members with computer knowledge and our magazine producer was (still
is) a missle technician in the RAF.

In the end the project was dropped. For athough we had the expertise and
the ordinance was freely available at prices much less than genuine
PORSCHE parts. None of our people could afford the outragous price of
the PORSCHE roofracks which in some cases cost more than the cars to
which they were to be fitted!
