=0A=0AHello P-Fans=0A=0A=09The following post/question reminded me of a c=
onversation I had with AL=0ACollins and Lary Bernshtein, then over at Aut=
othority a quite a few years ago.=0ALarry is now heading up the  new Cynt=
ex chip company in near Phili, Pa. He=0Ashould have products (chips) in a=
 few month(s) ? =0A=09=0A=09I was first introduced to APE back in 1988 wh=
en a freind of mine, James Sly=0Awrote a series of articles in a magazine=
 called European Car (formley=0AVW/Porsche Magazine). Over the years Larr=
y and Al used two of my past cars=0A(VW's:  a '90 G-60 and '92 VR6 Corrad=
o's) for chip development and Betta=0Atesting. I spent quite alot of time=
 over at APE. =0A=0A>=0A> How much more hp do you get when you chip a 944=
?=0A>Anyone seen/have a web where they talk about that?=0A>=0A=0A=09I ask=
 Larry and Al, how much HP the 944 Turbo makes in stock form. They told=
=0Ame that they just happened to had one on the engine dyno-stand and tha=
t they=0Ahave seen a range of 195 - 202 hp at the crankshaft. Even though=
 it was rated=0Awith 217 hp. Plus once the intercooler would heat up (lik=
e in the then current=0AESCORT Series) after a few heat runs, then the HP=
 really start to fall! =0A=09I don=92t remember what the HP numbers were =
for the  various =93chip(s)=94, but APE=0Adid not (and still does not) ge=
t too caught up in the  quotable numbers game.=0AThey felt that it was mo=
re important that the engine makes plenty of torque,=0Agood throttle resp=
onse, and good =93seat of the pants=94 feels fast. I know when=0Ait came =
to the =93program code=94, the program/mapping of that =93chip=94 version=
,=0Athey did not go for absolute HP numbers but what felt smooth and torq=
uey. I=0Abelieve that this is a better way to =93fine tune=94 the end chi=
p version. Do not=0Aget me wrong, APE did tune for acceleration and dyno =
numbers. But when it came=0Adown to making 1 hp at only one data point or=
 smoothing out the =93feel=94 over=0Asay a  transition at that particular=
 data point. APE tuned for the =93seat of=0Athe pants=94 mode and good to=
rque.=0A=0A=09I remember taking their shop beater car, a =9186 951 limite=
d edition =93club=0Asport=94, down the street for some "test laps". The  =
bench mark was go down the=0Astreet wit a stop watch, look for local poli=
ce ( APE is located on picket St.,=0Aknown locally as =93Ticket ST.=94), =
make a U-turn at the bottom of the hill and=0Aaccelerate hard in 2nd gear=
 (starting the stop watch at the fire hydrant ) up=0Athe hill and the sto=
pping it (the stopwatch) at the speed 35 mph limit sign.=0ABy that time y=
ou were well past the double nickel!  APE would just use this as=0Aa feel=
 and time/acceleration  imprompto-test. The car felt really good. I=0Arem=
ember one set of chips Al drove around with that had a lot of Hp, I think=
=0Amore than 330 Hp! I think I remember Al or Larry saying that about 340=
 Hp is=0Athe max power the stock fuel injectors will flow. =0A=09=0A=09On=
e thing that I like about APE is that they are constantly going back and=
=0Are- doing their chips. Offering upgrade to old customers, when they be=
come=0Aavailable. =0A=0A=09First they had the V1.0, which I think was onl=
y  had WOT mapping. Then they=0Ahad a second Generation chip=0A ( V2.0 ?)=
, part throttle and full throttle mapping. Then the currant one=0AV2.7, w=
hich was just a further refinement on a great product, WOT and part=0Athr=
ottle changes. =0A=0A=09The Stage II chips are good for 60-70 Hp for  tur=
bo "non-S" models. And for=0A"S" models can make another 15 Hp, over the =
"non-S" due to the big er turbo=0Aand the faster processor in the chip. A=
 chipped engine makes more boost (1.0=0Abar, 2.0 bar on the gauge) than s=
tock (1.7 bar). The engine makes more torque=0Adown low and pulls stronge=
r thru all the up the rev range. My car a stock 951=0Awith just APE stage=
 II and a test pipe, starts to make boost at 2200 rpms and=0Amakes full b=
oost at 3200 rpm, and really pulls hard from 4000 rpms and up. =0A=0A=09W=
ell that in my take on things as I remember them.=0A=0A-Davidjalai@aol.co=
