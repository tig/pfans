As promised, a post that announces the open registration for the PCA Zone 7 AX
School.  You can get the registration form by accessing the PCA Golden Gate
region web page via www.glenhhills.com.  This event always gets full almost
immediately, i.e, within a few weeks, if not days, after registration opens.
So if you are thinking about attending, go to the web page, get the form, fill
it out, and send it, along with yor check to the co-chair, Masuo.  Or send e-
mail to Masuo (address below) and he will send you the form via US Mail.

Anyone is welcomed to sign up and attend, as long as they are driving a
Porsche.   I cannot tell you how much fun this is-- you'll have to try it and
see for
yourself.  It is worth planning a mini-vacation around, if you live within a
reasonable distance of the SF Bay Area.  

Thanks again to Henry Watts, the original author of the post that follows.
For those of you who don't know Hank, he has written two books about cars.
One of them is called Secrets of Solo Racing, which is all about AX and solo
track event driving.  Great book-- you get one with your $98 entry fee for the
School.  Also makes an excellent gift.

Let's see some water pumpers out there!

Subject: 1998 Northern California Autocross School


>The dates have been set for the 1998 Zone 7 Beginner and Intermediate 
>Autocross School.  May 2 & 3 at Candlestick Park (3COM for the 
>infidels among you).  This 2-day school spends Saturday on basic
>exercises (skidpad, braking, decreasing-radius, linked turns, slalom, etc.)
>then features two autocross courses on Sunday.  Enrollment is limited
>to 90 students and it will fill up very fast once the notices hit the Zone
>7 regional newsletters in either the Jan or Feb issues.  There will be
>about 60 instructors, so the student-instructor ratio is very good.
>
>I can absolutely recommend this weekend as one of the best ways to
>get into competitive driving or to hone your skills.  I ran the school for
>a number of years.  Chairmen Masuo Robinson and Jeff Sykes took
>over last year.  All their changes have been for the better.
>
>We have had a number of people travel to the school from the southland
>and from Oregon/Washington.  Those who have done so reported that
>it was a worthwhile trip.  I would suggest that the Bay Area is a nice
>place to visit with your Porsche anyway, but the school schedule is
>pretty strenuous with lots of course time and no one's going to want
>to party very much either evening.
>
>Cost is $98.
>
>To proceed, contact Masuo:  
>	"Masuo Robinson" <masuo@ix.netcom.com> OR access the PCA Golden Gate Region
web page via www.Glenhhills.com
