Menelaos,
    I think you'll be happy you replaced the water pump. Even if it isn't
actively leaking right now, I would have replaced it just because it had
shown signs of leakage. Of course, I've had a water pump lock up less than
1000 miles after a belt change when it had shown no signs of leakage.  944
water pumps tend to scare me because I know that a catastrophic failure can
destroy your timing belt and cost you a valve job. Water pumps are strange
creatures. I've seen pumps go out at 25,000 miles while others have lasted
90,000 miles. A lot of it has to do with how the car is driven and weather
conditions. Short trips and cold winters seem to be much harder on water
pump seals. I tend to shy away from rebuilt water pumps unless I know  the
rebuilder. Some are very reliable while others will use cheaper bearings
and seals to maximize profit. 

Good Luck,
Clark Fletcher
