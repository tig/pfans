Hi gang

Following up on my request on Monday for help with a couple of things, I am
still looking for a way to remove the Porsche CR-1 radio from the
console/dash.  Will I have to take apart the console??

I have completed the replacement of the cigarette lighter.  I did have to
completely remove the glove box in order to gain access to the lighter
receptacle.....not that bad of a process, just a bunch of screws to take
out and having to pop out the little interior light, being careful not to
bend the contacts.  Probably the two most difficult things to do were: 1)
trying to get that stupid steel clip back over the plastic clips around the
lighter receptacle; and 2) keeping the rubber hose attached to the back of
the cabin temp sensor opening fitting (finally solved that by using a thin
cable tie.....lucky for me I'm in the electrical business-have lots of them
around).

I confirmed that the lighter receptacle was bad, since there was power at
the connector to it, but not inside the receptacle itself.  While I had
access to the wires, I tapped off of them for an extra 2-wire connector for
additional accessories(routed so that it lays in the glove box when not in
use, and hangs down behind the glove box door for use).  The replacement
lighter assembly (around $45-48 in most mail-order catalogs) was $34.26
(after 15% PCA discount) plus sales tax from my local Porsche dealer.

I guess my next major job (besides the radio) will be to remove the seats
to fix the seatbelt warning light wiring and to install my competition lap
belts and anti-sub straps.

Until the next time...........Let not the sands of time get in your lunch.
