John,

If you went by the Excellence article you'd have to run away, wouldn't you!
And from some of the prices I've heard talked about lately on the list here
for Turbo S's in other parts of the country it SOUNDS LIKE there's some
"deals" to be had.

Personally IMHO, I think the price is quite fair. Although I would look
particularly hard for "storage damage" given the exceedingly low mileage for
a 9 year old car, 22K is hardly broken in and a "new" Turbo S for this money
sounds fantastic to me. This of course assumes the mechanical condition and
documentation is as flawless as the outward appearance. And I believe you
already understand the importance of reviewing records as opposed to taking
the PO's word for it.

My perspective is based on watching Pano and Autoweek ads for more than 2
years and on purchase experience. My current '88 Turbo S, Stone Grey
Metallic/Light Grey with about 67K, excellent service records (new clutch,
belts, H2O pump and all the regular problem areas) and was quite clean with
only the usual stone nicks on the front and needed new carpeting--$17,500,
Chicago, 1997.  An '89 Turbo Cobalt Blue/linen with 83K, spotty service
records but equally clean $13,500, Columbus, 1996 (put about $3K service
costs 1st 4 mo.). An '89 Turbo, White/Linen and 37K, never saw snow,
flawless in every way $21,000, Atlanta, 1997.

Sure, there may be "deals" floating around out there and I'm sure we'll
continue to hear about them. So often, though, when you go to look at them
you find someone else's perspective on "flawless" is obviously different
than your own.

And then there is the topic of priorities. Some people seek perfection in
everything they do and own -- to them it MUST be flawless or they wouldn't
be happy. Other people are less concerned with the details and just want "to
own and S", or simply enjoy driving the car. If you just want to own an "S",
I'm sure you can find a better deal. If this car is "perfect", I would
suggest snapping it up quickly.
