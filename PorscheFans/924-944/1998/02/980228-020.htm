      Someone wrote (and I paraphrase):
<can we drop the bra stuff...blah,blah,blah>

Speaking for myself I enjoy waiting and anticipating what other's such =
as Lee and Jim Richmond are going to come back with, and I think a lot =
of us enjoy it. What's wrong with some good 'ol banter. Is your gripe bec=
ause it was off topic or you just didn't find it amusing? If you don't =
find it amusing hit delete.  But the tone was more like we shouldn't have=
 gotten off topic. I don't understand why we can't get off topic every =
now and then. We're Porsche owners talking...so what if its not always =
about THE Porsche. Just 'cause somebody had a bad day shouldn't keep the =
rest of us from having a good time.
