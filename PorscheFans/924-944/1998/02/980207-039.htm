Hey everybody!  First, I'd like to thank everyone for helping me with all my
questions about getting a Porsche (944 vs 951). Anyway I ended up buying a 951
(cranberry in color, new clutch, chipped, 112000 miles, perfect interior) for
8100.00.  I thought it was a great buy. My problem is, it has GOTTI wheels
(aluminum with gold )  I need to know how to locate a dealer who sells these
because 2 of the wheels are missing the little cap that goes at the center of
the wheel.  If anyone has any info on these I'd really appreciate it.  I live
in Richmond,Va (if that helps)  My email is JSHARRY@AOL.COM.  Thanks for the
help.  Oh yeah, I pulled up to a light the other day and a mid-80's 911 pulled
beside me.  I guess he thought he could take me.  To give make the list proud,
I dusted him!!  CHIP YOUR 951.  It's not expensive and it's a world of
difference.


86 951 chipped (raaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!!!)  AKA: 911 EATER
