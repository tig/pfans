I don't know if this matters, but in the article which started
this thread, the original poster did not say that he was having 
"excessive" pinging, just pinging/knocking to some unknown extent
in his NA (not turbo) 944.  (I believe the later 944s were fitted
with knock sensors due to their raised compression ratio). Perhaps
the poster could elaborate on the frequency of the pinging/knocking.

In his book, _Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management_,
Charles Probst gives a similar procedure for testing knock
sensors in Motronic systems, only he recommends revving the
engine to 2500rpm and checking the timing to make certain 
that it retards or "jumps out of its window" when the knock 
sensor is lightly tapped. He says that if it doesn't, then
the knock sensor is "most likely" bad.
