Hello John & P-fans

	While I do not mean to belittle your mechanical ablility, have you checked
your clutch slave cylinder? Typically the slave will leak/weep and drip down
around to the oil pan. This looks like the rear main is leaking, when in fact
it is the slave! Also check the master cylinder, under the clutch/brake/gas
pedal area for leaks (are your floor matts wet?) It is far more common for the
slave/master to go than it is for the rae main. If it is indeed the rear main
seal, I would only replace it when also replacing the clutch. Lots of work! 

Good Luck
David Jalali

Subject: Oil Leak?


        Lately I have seen a spot of oil on my garage floor so I 
decided to investigate.  Upon putting my car on the lift, at my high
school garage,  I found that my rear crank seal appears to be leaking,
it is located at the rear of the oil pan, yes or no, and that there is
oiling coming from an area by the oil pressure sending unit.  These 
leaks are both minor.  Should I bother fixing them?  My oil consumption
is about 1/2 quart every 1200 miles.  My shop teacher says that replacing
the rear crank seal is hard but fun.  TIA.

P.S.    About how much is the rear crank seal and is it a 1 or 2 piece seal?
