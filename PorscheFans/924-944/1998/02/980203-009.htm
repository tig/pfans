As I have said in a thread some time earlier this year, my 83 944 na was
purchased fm a doctor for $1,350. He just wanted to get rid of it. He
too upgraded to a 911 Carrera. You were quite lucky still to get yours
for such a decent price considering you had your heads rebuilt and belts
redone @ 91k miles on the odometer. As for myself, my 944's odo stopped
@ 94,726 and who knows how long ago this bugger stopped working. The
problems I encountered were few but rather critical, even vital for
proper functioning: the oil cooler leak and the DME system had bad
reference sensors on the flywheel bell housing. Go figure...... the
common problems that everyone on the list has experienced. Still, it
seems to me that the earlier 944's were the ones that seem to be lower
estimated in value and the ones 85.5 on up to the 968's are priced quite
higher.
