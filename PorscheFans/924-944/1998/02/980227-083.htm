	[Trapp, Benjamin]  I think last month's Panorama Magazine
featured a letter from the PCA president(?) that encouraged all Porsche
owners to continue the traditional "salute" of flashing one's lights at
the other Porsche driver.  I'm not sure if this person was the PCA
president or whatever (she's the blonde one with her hair up in the
picture, and if you examine the photos of all the PCA officers on the
last page of each Panorama, she's the ONLY person who looks like they
had their picture taken after 1963!), but she probably doesn't own a
944.  Ever try and flash someone in your 944 during the day time?  For
some reason, the other Porsche drivers never pay attention!  Just
another 911-biased conspiracy by the air-cooled guys to keep us
water-cooled guys down!  (And I don't want to hear about you people in
other countries with those fancy-shmancy European "driving lights" that
you can use to flash people with!)
		Anyway, I always wave at other Porsche owners and I
actually feel bad if someone waves to me but I'm too busy adjusting my
radio that I can't return the favor without swerving into a mailbox.
Hey, I waved to the driver of a light-blue metallic 944 turbo owner this
afternoon, are you out there?  (I was in the red 951.)
		Lee, is it harder to flash other driver's with your new
bra?  Sorry John.

Ben
