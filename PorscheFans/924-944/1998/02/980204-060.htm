Sorry, guys, but the 944 is just not worth what you think it is.

I agree that the car is the most bang for the buck, but that is because
prices are low.

With regards to Mike Fields' post, sorry, but I just purchased an east coast
89 Turbo for $12,500.  While shopping for the car, I met a lot of people
that overpriced their car and were not interested in budging.  I imagine
they still have their ride, because more than one had the attitued that they
would rather mothball the car than let it go.  I suppose that they think
that the value will go up in a year or two?

Look, the market sets the price, not Bruce, not you, and not me!  If you
feel bad, take heart, you could have bought the car new at $50k !

Best,

Mitch Tracy
