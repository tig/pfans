Just to be somewhat offbeat and off topic for a wee bit.......

Just think about it; what do you think of when one says "high-mounted
third brake light" and why did it come about as a common item on modern
manufactured vehicles?

Ok, this is what comes to my mind and why it's there: a "high-mounted
third brake light," in my opinion is a brake light that is mounted at
DRIVER'S EYE LEVEL and it's purpose is to give the driver of the
following vehicle warning to imminent stopping. This lamp is
intentionally mounted eye-level so that it would practically be in a
driver's field of vision (or in his/her way, so to speak) to be
effective. So, can someone please tell me why in the world are vehicles
"engineered" w/ this lamp mounted 3 to 5 feet taller than any normal
driver's eye-sight level? i.e. -- the new full-sized passenger vans,
mini-vans, etc. Not complaining, just a passing thought to throw out to
you to ponder on.
