In a recent service, I had the transmission fluid replaced.  I fluid that 
came out was in perfect condition and was replaced by Valvoline fluid.
Following the service, I have noticed that going from 1st to 2nd gear seems 
very notchy:
I am driving in 1st, ready to go into 2nd; I depress the clutch and shift 
the lever to 2nd.  If I go through in a singe motion, I can feel some 
resistance/grinding.  On the other hand, if I pause in neutral for a second 
and then shift into 2nd, there is no problem.  I have noticed that with 
going from 3rd to 4th but not to the same extent.
The strange thing is that the 1st to 2nd scenario existed with the old 
fluid aswell, except after the car had warmed up there was no problems.  
With the new fluid, I am noticing this on a continuous basis even after the 
car has been run for some time.
The car is just turning 60,000 miles.  Any advise would be appreciated.
