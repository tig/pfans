The last alignment I had done was by a reputable local
tire/brake/suspension shop. Before this alignment, my car always drifted
a little and never quite handled like it should.

I sprung for their $65 4-wheel alignment package (ok, so I'm a
cheapskate.) The tech spent three hours under my car cursing at it and
the entire nation of Germany, I think. He finally emerged from under my
car, covered in grease, and handed me the printout -- right on. 

The car handles significantly better now, considering that the
shocks/springs need replacement, and tracks perfectly. As for the shop,
they swore they would never, ever touch a Porsche 944 again. But I got a
cheap, good alignment, so I'm happy. I promised to send all my friends
there. <g> Essentially, I think that it all depends on the determination
of the individual working on your car.

Alex.
'84 944.

PS. While we're talking suspension, do strut braces really do anything
useful? Weltmeister vs. Racing Dynamics? Any downsides?
