To Alex and Everyone anoyed with the non P-car drivers.
Well for some time I thought it was normal that the cups stop me every
Friday night. But after listning to you guys I'm not sure any more. I am a
senior in college and one of only three who drive p-cars to school. Lately
I've been stopped by the cops twice, for no good reason and been harrased
by the parking gurds in school. This is getting too much. To top things
off yeasterday comming home from the library (a bar) I was at a stop sign
and this truck pulls next to me and start reving his engine. I really
wanted to step out of the car and knock some sense to him, but I let the
idiot go. 
I never get this kind of treetment when I drive my VW beetle around town.
I am convinced it's either my skin color or the car I drive. Since most
cops are color blind I assume it's the car I drive. I't nice to have a
place like this to let off steem. 
I've had a lot of people ask me how I can afford to keep a car like this,
and I just smile. ("If you did your own work, you can keep a car like this
too stupid" )that's what I really wanted to say. 
Anyway I talked to the student attorney and a few more stops by the cops
and I will be filing a harrasment sute against the city. Just wanted to
share my pain with everyone.
Now I feel more relaxed. Thanks for listning guys/gals.
