Hi, Carol,

Thanks for the advice. The question was whether the 94 Speedster Cab was
the right one for me.  It was arrestingly beautiful, but after driving it I
decided that having an armrest, a door handle, and power side mirrors
--comfort items, all-- were too important to me.  The Speedster is a
stripped-down sports convertible two seater with a fiberglass rear cover
that hides the convertible top and curves around the two seats. There were
only 409 made in 94.  I'm looking for a true sports car, not luxury, but I
expect to keep it for ten years and that's just too long to me to go
without ever resting my elbows.

If you've never driven an NSX, especially on a track, you really are
missing something.  It takes your breath away. You have never felt a sports
car hug the track like the NSX.  You can take a cloverleaf exit ramp at 90
mph and feel as if you are going 25. There are specific reasons why you can
do that--much having to do with special tires, two intentionally toed in
and the other two toed out, each specially made for their corner of the
car, and they last only 6,000-12,000 miles. It is nearly impossible to
break contact with the pavement, but once you do, it is spectacular, and
not in the good sense.  The car gives even a poor driver total control.  

Which is one reason so many people condemn these wonderful cars. We stand
on the sidelines and mutter, "that didn't require any skill" as they
consistently make excellent track times. If skill was truly the sole
standard, then getting a good track time in a Pinto would be the ultimate
macho track test.  

No, the NSX is condemned because it is too perfect. Other than the
intentional "tire wear problem," it has no foibles or quirks or bugs
affectionately known as "features." That makes it seem personality-less.  

On the other hand, the Porsche's strong personality has been loved despite
its oddities, its quirks, funny shape, air cooled engine, fake air
conditioning, throw-back analog gadgetry, and off-balance weight and engine
placement that makes it so easy to spin on the track. Or perhaps _because
of_ these things. 

The 944 is the Boxster of yesteryear.  It fixed many of the 911's quirks
with a water cooled engine, real AC, and well-balanced front engine
placement. This is why so many serious racers drive 944's on the
track--they have the advantages of the 911, but without the drawbacks.
Most of the 911's on the track are just people who want to drive their car
as close to its limits as they dare, because it takes serious, serious
skill to overcome its disadvantages and truly race a 911.

My original problem was that I wanted to get the Speedster at 47k, but my
husband counter-offered me by saying that if I would go for a new Audi A6
(my share would be $20k), then he would also give me half of his NSX as
well so I would drive a sports car half-time.  I won't go into how great
Audi's are here, since they're not sports cars, but now you should see why
it was so hard to make the decision--the NSX is an awesome car, and I'd
have two excellent cars for less than half the price of one 911.

But ultimately the decision came down to the fact that I just wouldn't be
happy driving a sports car _half_ the time, even if it is a great car.  I'm
now looking to buy a 95 Cabriolet, guards red, he's keeping his NSX, and
together we're buying a used Audi A6.  If I can just be patient and wait a
little longer, I may even be able to afford a newer or even new one soon.
And he thinks I'm going to give up my 944 in this whole deal, but I'm not.
It's an almost perfect car, with personality. ;-)
