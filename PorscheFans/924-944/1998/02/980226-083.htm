  I am sure a lot of 944 owners have this problem, but I haven't seen it
addressed on this page yet.  The plastic covering below the windshield that
covers some of the climate controls or whatever is severely cracked on my '87
944.  I've tried taping the cracks etc., but it is getting beyond the point of
repair.  I am assuming that if I let it go, too much water will get in there
and probably ruin somehting, causing an obnoxiously expensive repair.  The
usual loss of a $20 part causing a $500 repair.
  Does anyone know where you can get a replacement for this item?  I have
never seen them in any of the parts supplier catalogs.   Has anyone tried to
fabricate anything for that?  Could I just remove it, or would that be
inviting disaster?

Thanks for any help.  Please post your reply to the P-Fans page as I am sure
others probably wonder about this as well.
