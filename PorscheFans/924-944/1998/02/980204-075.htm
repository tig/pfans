I was there too Todd.  It sure was a pleasant surprise to see this old
944 at Daytona!!  I noticed that during qualifying, it had very few, if
any, decals on it (sponsers, etc.).  On race day, it decals all over it!
The starting line-up listed it 75th out of 77 cars.  The drivers of this
car surely spent much time looking in their mirrors!!  Nevertheless, I
am sure they had the time of their life.  I'd give anything to have been
in their shoes.  They finished 66th.  If only they had finished the
race!!  

There was also one 968 in the race - Finished 62nd.  They did not appear
to be running much faster!
