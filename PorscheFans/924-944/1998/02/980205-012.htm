Zdeslaw,

John Asp's response to you quoting a magazine article saying that the
Webber "Big Throat" made no noticeable increase of power on the dyno, is
misleading.  I have a 1982 924 that I had previously installed a Weber on
and it did make a difference.  While overall horsepower ratings may not
have changed, the torque curve and response time sure did.  The power came
on at a much lower RPM, and throttle response was drastically improved.
Not bad for a $150.00 US investment.

I have since decided to spend the real money and installed a set of Webber
40mm side draft carbs.  Big increase in power and response, 34% reduction
in fuel mileage, not very smooth when cold and you definitely must tinker
with them on a fairly regular basis to keep them balanced.  

Unless you are addicted to tinkering on your car, I would suggest the
throttle body upgrade.  For the money of the carburetors, plus the
headaches, take the cost of a set plus sell your car, and buy a 944. 

Unfortunately for my wife, I just can't leave anything alone.
