	      Hi folks,  I do not post much to this list because I do not like =
to spread disinformation!  I do most of my own work and would appreciate =
the manuals on disk as much as anyone else.  However, I do have an area =
where I do know what is going on, that of the law.  Now, this is not my =
actual area of expertise. (I am a prosecutor)  But, my wife is also a =
lawyer and she does some of this stuff.  We talked the copyright issue =
over and came to the conclusion that this would not work without some =
form of permission from the almighty Porsche.  Our understanding of the =
coping issue is that you are allowed to copy a document once for =
personal use.  (that means for yourself)  Any form of duplication and =
dissemination would incur the wrath of the copyright police.  Believe me =
I know what jerks lawyers can be!  Thus, you do not want that.  Someone, =
must write to the publication department at Porsche and propose this =
idea, with of course how you plan on paying homage to their original =
publication. (that converts to someone has to pay them for this idea)  I =
can only hope that they would see this as a good idea and not a threat =
to the sale of their somewhat costly manuals.  When the exact details =
have been worked out let me know and I could write them a detailed =
letter.  Someone also must figure out who to write this letter to.  So, =
the bottom line here is don't go off and copy these things without some =
form of approval from the source.  No flames guys, I will be out of town =
 thus, unable to defend myself!

 Brian - (Not a flame hear) How does this apply to the 'buy a copy of =
the microfisch and recieve your own CD backup copy idea' ? It would seem =
to me that it fits with the letter of the law (maybe not the spirit). It =
would be perfectly alright if each person made their own backup copies =
on CD of their own microfiche so what if someone lends them a hand to =
backup their manuals?
