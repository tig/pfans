One important factor to keep in mind when comparing mail order services is
their willingness to admit their mistakes.  When dealing with Zims,
Automotion, and Performance, I have easily come to an agreement over
disputed claims.  Unlike some of the other businesses, AutoAtlanta, although
having in general lower prices, has sales returns cut into sales reps
commissions.  In the past two years, I have bought almost $3000 in parts
from AA, about $300 of that were wrong or defective parts--not returnable
for one (advertised) reason or another.  In addition, AutoAtlanta won't take
the time, at least in my case, to respond to Better Business Bureau
inquiries to find a fair solution.  Personally, I now gladly pay more for
fair service and return policies than pay for less expensive parts from a
company who seems to assume the customer is always wrong.  I certainly do
not intend my opinion to be a flame--it's just the experience of only one
person who purchases $3-4K of OEM Porsche parts a year.
