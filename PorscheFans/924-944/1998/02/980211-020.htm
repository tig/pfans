Why not just buy the damn things? They represent a small fraction of the
cost of even a year of tires/oil/gas for your car. And if you think
about how much money they will save you the first time you do a job at
home instead of letting a shop do it, they are clearly one of the best
investments you can make, Porsche wise.>>>>>

I guess I am just cheap. I can't see spending $400 for a $100 tool and I
can't see buying the entire 924 series, the 944 series, and the turbo
book for well over $600.

Making illegal copies of copyright material is against the law. That is
why every library in the country has a Xerox machine in the reference
section. You are breaking the law! Stop it right now! Enclosed is my $20
for the bootleg CD version.
