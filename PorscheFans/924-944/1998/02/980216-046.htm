Spark Plugs for 951

I have tried the Bosch tri electrode plugs in both of my 951s.  They seem to
be a little "zippier" than the stock units.  Not quantifiable though.  These
can be had cheapest at the dealer.  A suggestion for cars running chips and
much greater than stock boost: use colder plugs. This was suggested by Jon
Milledge for my '87 which runs 1.1-1.2 bar.  I use the normal electrode 5
series (haven't yet found a tri electrode in a five series) in this car.

Transmission Oil

In my big BMW, I use Redline MTL, and it works great.  BUT in the Porsches, I
follow Bruce Anderson's age-old advice and run Swepco.  I have been using this
stuff for 10 years in 944 and 951 boxes.  Although Bruce's 951 price charts
are a little conservative for my tastes (after all I own a pristine $22,000
'89 951-- that is my opinion), his experience with Swepco dates back to
Porsche endurance racing.

Turbo S Sway Bars

I don't know what size came in back in the 88 year.  Both of the '89 951 cars
which I have owned have had 16 mm rear bars to go with the 26.8 mm (4mm thick)
front bars.  (Lee, the sales brochure is wrong-- I have two that contain this
misinformation).

Caster Blocks

This is very important.  Porsche has updated the caster blocks for 951 cars
sometime after or during1987 model year production.  In fact, the change may
have occured even more recently.  I have posted on this before.  The two
current versions (regular and M030) are different from what was stock.  The
stock versions in my '87 had the rubber break down which caused some unwanted
suspension movement under cornering or braking forces.  The newer version has
a clearly different design, seemingly to prevent this.  The difference between
regular and M030 as George has suggested is indeed the hardness (e.g.,
duromoter) of the rubber material.  Also, there is a service bulletin which
suggests an updated caster eccentric bolt is required for 17 inch wheels, to
allow more caster.  Not sure whether this updated part was ever in 944 or 951
production, but it is available from your dealer.  I just bought two to try
for more caster.

Accusump

Most race cars use the largest unit they can fit.  Usually seen in the
passenger side footwell, with a -12 line going through the firewall.  I have
seen some neat installs which use a Canton Meca filter with a fitting on top
to route the line to the Accusump.  The filter is easier to deal with than
normal type, and screws right onto the existing fitting.  Sometimes people
mount the Accusump in the right rear storage bin, but this is much less
desirable than the footwell (distance matters).

Wheel Offset

A number of people have asked why the wheel offset changed for 87 and later 94
and 951 cars.  The answer is ABS.  ABS requires a negative scrub radius.  Even
though not all of the cars had ABS in the beginning, it only makes sense to
buy one style of parts, so the offsets (and related parts) were changed.

Porsche Club of America

If you live in an area where there is a PCA region, join.  Go to some events.
Consider the purchase of several volumes of Up-fixen der Porsche, the
PCA/Panorama compilation books.  These things are like encyclopedias.  If you
live anywhere near the upcoming tech event mentioned by George B. in the
Northeast, go.  If you live in the Bay Area, come out to AX and learn how to
really have fun in your car in a safe environment.  Peggy Fleming did.
