>>Can somebody discuss the procedure for the replacement of the in-tank
      fuel filter/screen, and perhaps supply a part number? 

Fuel Filter in where? I have an 83 944na. I do recall that the fuel pump
itself is located adjacent to the tank just to the right of it and then
the actual inline fuel filter is forward of the tank right where the CV
joint crosses over fm the transaxle to the swingarm and of course,
there's a check valve inline somewhere in the system. Now, if this
"screen" or some sort of wire mesh is located inside of the tank and it
appears that you're saying that you're having problems, then that means
you have large debris blocking proper fuel flow? Just asking because you
didn't really say why you needed to get to that screen. I'm assuming to
clean it or replace it. As for the actual part nr, I checked my catalogs
for Auto Atlanta (new and old ones), Automotion, Performance Products
and Tweeks and no joy in finding such animal. They have complete tanks
and the other components that go inline of the system but thats it.
Perhaps someone else on the list may have some info.
