Hi Rob,

It sounds like we have the same exact setup.  I too have a '92 968 with R1's
on 17" Forgelines and no M030 package.  I did three track days at Mid Ohio
last year no brake problems whatsoever.  In fact I thought braking
performance was one of the best things about the car.  I brake aggressively
too.  I also have a '93 Twin Turbo RX7 which I have driven at Mid Ohio and I
like the braking performance on the 968 much better.  In response to your
questions:

>1)  Increase venting to the rotors.  The fellow I spoke with mentioned
>adding a "vent" which is directed on the center of the rotors.  Since
>heat is the big enemy of braking, this sounds logical.  Has anyone

My car already has large plastic scoops that direct lots of air to the front
rotors.  I have always assumed that these were stock on all 968s.  Do you
not have these?  The only thing I have ever considered to improve cooling is
removing the shield behind the rotor.       


>2)  Steel brake lines.  When the rubber lines get hot, they flex, thus

Squishiness was not a problem for me at all.  My pedal was consistently firm
on each of my three track days.  I think a proper flush and bleed with fresh
high temp fluid right before a track event is more important than steel
brake lines.  Cheaper too.  


>3)  Motul (?) 600 brake fluid.  It's supposed to have a high 500's
>(~580ish?) dry boiling point temp.  I believe this is higher that ATE
>Super Blue, which I'm using now.  It's only $12ish per pint (or whatever

>600 is another option, but it's $60/pint.  Not cheap.  Any thoughts
>here?


I also use ATE Super Blue.  I have heard good things about the Motul, but
right now with good results I have no reason to switch.  


>4)  Racing pads.  I've heard every opinion around about brake pads.  It
>seems each person or group of people swear buy one brand or another.  Is
>there any sort of consensus on this list?


I don't think you'll ever find a consensus on the type of pad.  The only
real consensus is that its best to use track pads on the track and street
pads on the street.  Anything else is an unacceptable compromise.  Street
pads suck on the track, and track pads dust like crazy and eat rotors at
street temperatures.  Pads are easy to change on the 968 too.  It should
take you less than an hour (including wheels on/off).  FWIW I use stock pads
on the street and Porterfield pads on the track.  I chose Porterfield simply
because I heard good things about them and I got a good deal on them.  I
wouldn't be averse to trying a different track pad though.  


>5)  S4/951S Calipers.  Obviously the most expensive option due to the
>necessary rotors, pads, and billet adapter which will accompany the
>upgrade.      


At least for now I'm not prepared to spend that kind of money for something
that I don't perceive to be much of a problem.  Maybe someday...  


Now here is a question for *you*.  What size R1s are you getting?  I have F
235/45 and R 275/40.  I wanted to go wider in the front, but I was told that
the 245/45 would be too tall.  BFG doesn't make 245/40, but Hoosier does, so
I was thinking of trying them next time.  What are you hearing?
