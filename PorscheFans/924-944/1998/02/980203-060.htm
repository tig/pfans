Hello all, I am finishing the interior reconditioning of my 944S and I am
considering different options concerning the seats. The seats are in fairly
good condition except for at the front of the seat under the leg. I think the
leather was not taken care of at some time and the leather dried and created a
small tear at the seam. I have had it looked at by an upholstery shop, and
they said the entire seat would need to be recovered. The cost was some where
around $1200 for both. Since I have the Porsche sport seats, I dont want to
just change them out, but are there any good cover kits out there that dont
look really bad? I was considering just having them re-done in vinyl, but I
dont like that idea either. If I keep them the way they are, what is suggested
as a wax or conditioner. If it werent for the tear, the seats really would be
in good condition.
Thanks,
Terry
