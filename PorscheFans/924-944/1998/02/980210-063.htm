I'm sure many of you have been contacted by me asking for you to videotape
your repair operations.  Some have agreed, some have no time or no means.
That's ok.  I really appreciate the enthusiasm I've gotten for this little
project.

Right now, we have eight contributors with twelve projects.  Everything from
simple "How to install a baby seat" to a Timing Belt Replacement.  This is
gonna be great!

If you are planning on doing any repairs or maintenance operations, I as
well as the rest of the list would appreciate your contribution.  Check out
my web page at http://www.millcomm.com/~mneustad then follow the Service
Video Link.  If you're into stream of consiousness rambling, you can check
out the Porsche Therapy thing too.  I'm so tired of winter....

Anyway let's also not forget that the service video is a way to put faces
with names on the list so EVEN IF YOU DON'T DO A REPAIR I'd still like to
see a tape of you.  I'm envisioning a repair, a little track footage, an
introduction of a list member, another repair, etc...  This will be so
great!
