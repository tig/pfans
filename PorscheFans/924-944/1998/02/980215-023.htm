I purchased my 90S2Cab in october, and there was a consistent smell of
gasoline inside the car.  Before I put it away for the winter, I took it to
the dealership to have them fix it.  They replaced the fuel filler, and told
me that would take care of it.  Today, I filled up the gas tank, and the smell
returned.

Has anyone experienced a problem like this before?  The smell seems to be
eminating from behind the passenger rear seat (next to the fuel filler).  Does
anyone have any ideas of why this is happening, or it's seriousness of the
problem?  I am not leaking gas, at least there is none on the garage floor,
and the smell is only on the inside of the car.  Is it the dealer's
resonsibility to fix the problem, if I brought in again?

Thanks for any help,
-Paolo
