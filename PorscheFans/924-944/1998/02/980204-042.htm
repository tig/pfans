I have personally spoken with several people who purchased the Auto Thority
Mass Flow kit with and without the K-27 turbo.  Many of them like it.  They
spent the money so they have to.  At least two people I know had it de-
installed.  One was a guy whose 951 car was described in Excellence in 1995.

The two guys I know who got rid of this stuff have/will have Milledge motors.
I have been told by a variety of sources that have done the dyno work, that
the stock air flap box will flow enough air for about 400 bhp.  So unless you
are going to/above that level the mass flow sensor may not be cost-effective.
If it were say $100, I might buy one just to have better access to the front
of my motor.  Otherwise, forget it.
