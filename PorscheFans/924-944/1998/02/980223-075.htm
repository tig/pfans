The TDC mark next to the dist. cap should be close to the center of the
access hole.  At the very bottom of the flywheel is a notch.  it may
have white paint as well, i can't remember.  This should line up exactly
in the center of the small access slot in the bottom of the clutch
housing.  A little to the left (driver's side) of the top of the
flywheel is a third TDC mark.  A large square opening in the
clutch/flywheel housing exists.  it is not far from the oil filler.  You
will need a flashlite to find it.  You will likely also have to move the
wiring/harness's in the area above the flywheel to find it.  It is there
- beleive me.  Once you have found it, it will not be hard to find
again, but you will need a flashlight always.  Line the TDC mark on the
flywheel (marked OT from the top) with the notch on the right
(passenger) side of the flywheel (as can be seen in most service books. 
You may check for the notch at the bottom of the flywheel for
verification that you have the flywheel perfectly aligned.  Both marks
on the flywheel will exactly line up.  the notch near the dist. cap will
be within the access hole, but not exactly the center.

Hope some of this helps.
