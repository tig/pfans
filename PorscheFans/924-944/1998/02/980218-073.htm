I'm just completely out of luck nowadays. Regarding my alternator trouble I
went for a listmember's advice to charge the car for 15 minutes and drive
for 5, charge, drive etc. until I get to a repair shop. Well, I tried
anyway. I got a friend to hook up the wires between the cars. What he didn't
know, and what I didn't think of at the moment, was that my + cable has
always been black, and that the new ground cable I bought just last year was
red. Well, guess what happened. No, the battery didn't explode. Luckily he
connected the + from the other car to the - on my battery, and the - on the
other car to a ground point on my car (i.e. not the + on the battery).

The only problem is - what he referred to when saying "that looks like a
good ground point" was the hood locking mechanism. So what he effectively
did was turn the other battery into a super-duper welding device, and now
the hood is completely stuck.

So... Has anyone here tried to open the hood from underneath? Is it
possible, or even easy? Nothing would please my wallet more than a friendly
tip.
