Hi Greg,

Sorry to hear about the accident.  I am an insurance adjuster myself and specialize in 
wrecked cars.  I am also the President of the Wichita I-CAR Committee, a volunteer 
organization for continuing collision training of body shop and insurance people.

My first concern is that your shop is using jigs for structure work.  Jigs are great but 
only within certain limitations.  The primary concern is that jigs work only on the 
lower box of the structure.  

Please allow me to explain: Every vehicle has three levels, or boxes, of structure.  The 
first is the lower box and on a pickup truck this would be the actual frame itself.  
Porsches do not have a separate frame so this box would be the floor, suspension 
crossmembers and other structure at that level.  The second is the beltline box, located 
at the top of the cowl, top of the shock towers, etc.  The third box is at roof level.  

For a proper repair, one must first square each box and make sure that all the boxes are 
square with each other.  Therein lies the rub with a jig system.  Typically they work 
only on the lower box.  With attachments they might be able to reach the top of the 
shock towers but that would be as far as they would go into the beltline box.  The roof 
box is simply out of reach.  Question: How will they know that they have all three boxes 
square with each other?

Can a quality shop achieve a quality repair with a jig?  Yes, providing that they have a 
proper measuring system and adequate pulling capacity in their frame equipment.  It is 
very time consuming in most cases however because one doesn't dare use the jigs to pull 
with.  They are only intended for measuring and would bend under pressure.   One has to 
pull and then check against the jig.  Remove the jig, pull, reassemble the jig and check 
again.  Etc. Etc.  What happens if one is measuring against an already bent jig?  Ugh.

In Wichita we junked that system a decade ago.  Now we use modern frame equipment, such 
as a Chief EasyLiner with multiple pulling attachments and laser/computer measuring 
systems.  Does a fantastic job, incredibly accurate, and has no problem in squaring all 
boxes to themselves and each other.

I would also insist upon a HEATED DOWNDRAFT PAINT BOOTH along with refinish technicians 
that are I-CAR certified or have been to a proper factory paint school and have the 
certificates to prove it.  No booth then no job as far as I am concerned.

This is NOT a direct knock on your shop.  I've never been there and do not know them at 
all.  Don't even know what state they are located in.  Having said that, your list of 
problems scares me.  I have been around shops that supposedly have reputation but it 
turns out that the reputation comes only from the facts that (a) they charge so much 
that everyone thinks that they MUST know what they are doing and (b) they are the only 
ones in the area that typically fool with off-breed vehicles such as Porsche.  They 
achieve a certain intimidation factor that they use when dealing with adjusters and 
customers but the actual truth is that they are below-average in terms of knowledge and 
quality of repairs.  If any of this sounds familiar to you than my suggestion is to run, 
not walk, to the nearest mainline collision center.

Checkout the yellow pages for the largest ads (They are usually good candidates) then 
take a personal tour of them.  The reception area should be much like a doctor's office 
with receptionist, carpet, waiting area, etc.  The shop itself should be clean, neat, 
productive, and professional.  A good measuring system, frame machine, and proper paint 
booth are manditory.  There should be diplomas on the wall and the estimate should be 
computerized.  There should be a written, lifetime guarantee on the repair.  No need to 
get estimates - your insurance adjuster can handle that for you.  Just be an informed 
consumer and do some shopping before deciding on a particular shop.

Tiny, one or two man shops are a thing of the past.  Slow, expensive, and typically with 
below-average work quality, they really can't compete with the big boys anymore. 

Also, it would be a good idea to keep all collision related repairs - even mechanical - 
with just one shop.  Otherwise there is a lot of finger-pointing from one shop to 
another if something goes wrong in the repair.  With only one shop responsible then 
there is no question about who has to stand behind it.

Good luck,
