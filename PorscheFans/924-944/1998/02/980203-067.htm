Wow, I've received TONS of sympathetic responses to my rant. I therefore
submit to all a list of vehicles to avoid: (If I bag on something you
drive, I'm just making broad generalizations about vehicles. Don't take
it personally. <g>)

1) The Rice-Boy Rice-Rocket. Basically the decked-out Hondas or Acura
Integras. Tend to be driven by 17-22 year old kids, but purchased by
their parents. Decked out to look fast, but isn't. You'll hear the
exhaust system a mile away.
2) The VW Hippie-Bus. Old VW Micro-Bus, sometimes sporting a "custom"
paint job, perhaps a nice set of curtains, or a "too slow, too bad"
bumper sticker. Jerry's dead, man. When floored, goes 40 up a hill.
3) Van-Man. Trashed, dented old Chevy or Dodge van, generally brown with
a few 4" wide trim stripes. May have a painting of a peaceful sunset on
the rear window. One headlight out. Don't expect him to signal, it
doesn't work any more.
4) BMW 740i. Sorry BMW drivers, gotta say that these people love to cut
you off. Probably on purpose. No, they don't care. They're on the phone.
Would the world would stop if they hung up and drove? Of course, silly
of me to ask.
5) King Monster Truck. A standard Toyota pickup, with 4 foot ground
clearance, six foot CB antenna, and KC lights. Rolled it over when he
tried to take it off-road.
6) King Rusty Truck. Big ol' Detroit Iron. Body rusted through, but
disguised with an amateur camoflouge paint job. Don't hit it, the
bumpers fell off last week.
7) The Clunker. Usually a Datsun B210, Ford Fiesta, or Citation. Dating
from 1977-1981, these few classic pieces of Americana (well, not the
Datsun) demonstrate the remarkable ability of an engine to run 300,000
miles or more through the simple disabling of one cylinder, both
headlights, the horn, turn signals, windshield wipers, air conditioning,
and exhaust system. One window must also be removed and covered by a
plastic bag, and a rag is substituted for the gas cap. The highway
patrol drives by these wrecks and goes after me instead because they
know I will show up to court and pay my radar tax. Besides, I still have
license plates.

Later all,
Alex.
'84 944, with all safety equipment in place and functional. Signals at
all turns.
