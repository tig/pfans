Sam,
  Congrats on your new (to you) 944! I know you will enjoy it. I really 
enjoy mine. As for the concerns, here is my 2 cents worth:

1) Oil cooler Leaks: Yes, they do happen on that year too. Mine had one.
2) Waterpumps: Yes, they break just as much. 
3) I use the old 30K rule in regards to belt replacement.
4) Your Temp. Gauge is normal. Make sure it does'nt get above the 3rd mark 
or the warning light will appear. It should'nt if the cooling system is 
running normal. I live in central Florida, and mine stays cool. 
5) I usually shift at 4K. If I am running on fumes, I might choose to shift 
at 3K. If you are fine with the performance, 3K will let things last longer, 
obviously. Since we don't have turbos, it is a judgement call. 
6) Watch out for a brown film developing inside the coolant tank. Also check 
for dripping moisture under the oil filler cap (w/ cold engine). Those are 
warnings of a possible oil cooler leak. 
7) I have never touched the differential fluid since I bought the car. 
8) Check for oil deposits inside the air intake hose. This is the hose just 
after the MAPP sensor box. It should be silver in there. If there are oil 
deposits, the PVC valve might be shot. 
9) If the brake fluid has not been changed, do it. 
10) The thermostat can cause overheating problems if it is old. DO NOT BUY 
ONE FROM A REGULAR PARTS STORE!! Get it from PORSCHE ONLY!! The part store 
ones do not open as far, have a smaller opening, and WILL cause major 
overheating!! Been there, done that. 
11) Those are my major gripes. Keep informed with the daily listings and you 
will learn all sorts of neat things.....like where the blinker fluid tank is,
 for example. 

    Good Luck,
      Todd Kent
