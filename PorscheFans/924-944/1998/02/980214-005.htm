Gary,
    When you say you replaced the injector relay, do you mean the DME
relay? The reason I ask is because those are classic symptoms of a DME
relay failing. If you did replace the DME relay, I would next try cleaning
the contacts on the throttle position switch. Although I doubt is that is
the problem it's a quick and easy check. I sounds like your DME control
unit could be failing but, unless your mechanic has a spare, you don't
won't to buy one and later find out that isn't the problem. There are
several other problems that could cause this including a bad crank position
or reference sensor. I've even seen the ignition switches cause similar
problems. A bad head temperature sensor can cause the car to run rough but,
shouldn't keep it from starting. Based on your symptoms, I believe the two
most likely causes are the DME relay or the DME control unit itself. Keep
us posted.

Good Luck,
Clark Fletcher
