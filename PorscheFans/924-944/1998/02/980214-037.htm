   Hey P-fans,
      I wanted to share my most recent learning experience. I have been
replacing my front end in my 1985.5 NA,( steering rack tie rods, struts) and
needed the passenger-side conrol arm (a-arm) , the late aluminium  one . I
checked all the usual sources , ads in Excellence, Tweeks, Auto Alanta, etc.
and called Zims. Their ad said  $129 exchange, with rebuildable core charge of
$150. On the phone was quoted  $199 exchange, same core charge. The part
arrived quickly, looked good, and had been fitted with a grease zert fitting.
So far , so good.
The problem arose upon the return of my core. Instead of $ 150 credit they
gave me 50 dollars because they claimed the bushings needed replacing in my
core.
If  my part was good, I wouldn't  have replaced it! I feel like Zims charged
me  for something that they would have had to do anyway. I would asume that a
reconditioned a-arm would automatically include a new ball joint and new
bushings.
If it is Zims practice to sell remanufactored parts with used bushings I would
think the list should know about this. If on the other hand they charge you
for your new bushings and charge you for new ones in your core, this is
deceptive practice. A company that will decieve in on instance probably will
in others. Either their safety and quality are suspect or their eithics are. I
won't use them again and would caution others not to either.
By the way, the other guys who rebuild these things, i forget their name, but
they are in Houston, Texas  are selling them for $179  or $199, installed! I
got their ad 2 days after I ordered from Zims. 
Oh , Well at least my car handles well. The Lone Star  Region PCA auto-X is
tomorrow but we have a 80% chance of rain ! Bummer....
