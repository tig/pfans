Hi all,

Just thought I'd warn anyone looking for an '89 944 turbo that they =
should
definitely *avoid* the car owned by Barry Robertson from Powell, TN.  It
is listed in the February issue of Panorama.

This is the *same* car I was going to purchase last November from Rick
Hill Imports in Kingsport, TN.  I even flew down from Seattle to purchase
it after it was supposedly "checked out" and given the green light by the
local PCA mechanic (a.k.a., scam artist).  At the time they told me it =
had
been traded in by Mr. Robertson.  Could be, but if so, that means he
bought it back.

Anyway, as list members will remember, the car was a disaster: horrible
looking painted factory forged wheels, bald tires, worn-out brakes and
discs, repainted door, bleached out carpets, broken odds and ends,
dashboard like the grand canyon, etc, etc.

Now get this, the car is now listed for $21,500!  At the time I was going
to pay $17,800 for it (asking price $19,995) but after seeing it I said
"no way, I'm outta here."  The dealer tried to get me to buy the car for
$16,000 and said they'd put new tires on it.  Still no deal.  I wouldn't
have given them $10K for it.

So, be smart.  When it comes to buying a Porsche, DON'T TRUST ANYONE you
don't know personally, and be leery of even those "pristine" cars from
Pano.

Regards,
