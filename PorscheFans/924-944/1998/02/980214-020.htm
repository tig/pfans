I would appreciate hearing from anyone with opinions on water pump replacements.

I just received a water pump from a mail order outfit, that shall remain
nameless, that offered a rebuilt pump, but the part was an outdated style
(944.106.124.1R as marked on the casting) and it still has the guard rail. 
The problem is the thermostat mounting is offset from the new version by 2.5
mm and the new thermostat will not fit.  Is the old thermostat still available?

The date casting is stamped 86 28 which I assume is the 28th week of 1986. 
However, the Tech Bulletin #1 states that July 1986 was the start date of the
new style water pump on Porsche engines.

I am leaning toward returning the pump and buying a brand new one as the price
is only $70 more and I can't imagine any benefits with a rebuilt pump. 
Certainly, any monetary benefits have evaporated with the need to return the
pump I have now, not to mention that both garage bays are, once again, filled
up with one car that doesn't run.

Off road again.
