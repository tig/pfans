Back in 95 I bought my car from an out of state owner. I live in
NY, the car was in Florida. I had the owner make a videotape of
the car, sitting the garage, out in the driveway, as it was 
being driven, etc. When that looked good, I made an offer, 
pursuant on the car passing a prepurchase inspection. Everything
was fine, so I flew down, bought the car, and drove it home.

Other than having to replace the waterpump right away (the
shop noticed 'a small drip', my mechanic said 'look, you're
going to be driving this thing on the track, take care of
it right') I've been happy ever since.
