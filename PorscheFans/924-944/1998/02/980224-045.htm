To what I recall fm some of the "944" history books that I have at home,
the only thing that really was considered to be of non-Porsche was the
gearbox or transaxle as it is normally called. The transaxle is Audi
designed and built, at least to what I remember. The 944's engine
starting fm the 2.5L on up was all original Porsche, unlike the 924
which had a VW designed engine and built by Audi. The 924 project was
bought fm VW by Porsche. So, one could say that the original concept of
the 924 could be thought of as VW? We all know that the 944 was really
the first water-cooled production car that was world-wide accepted as a
"Porsche" and not a hybrid. I do know that the 944 shares similar, if
not, the same electrical components as some VW or Audi, i.e. -- Hella or
Bosch components and some parts found on the interior I have found the
VW/Audi emblems imprinted or stamped on them, like the old styled
steering wheel has when the center horm panel is removed. I'm only going
by what I've experienced so far. I don't profess myself as a Porsche
historian, so folks please be merciful on me. You can reschedule the
public stoning on a federal government holiday so that the U.S. Coast
Guard won't dock me one day of leave from my books!!! :-)
