     Hi Everybody,
     
        Recently I test drove a 1988 944 Turbo S.  It has 48,460 miles, is 
     in excellent condition in and out, and drove real well.  It was also 
     maintained very well as the owner's stack of receipts show.
     So far I am very happy that I found this rare example of a super car. 
     Aside from the A/C not working it seems to be a great find.  
     
        However I have a few questions from this test drive that I would 
     like to address that will go a long way to determining whether I will 
     buy it.  Here they are:  
      
          1)  The idle speed was 1,200 RPM (smooth, no hunting) when the 
     engine was cold and hot.  Is this normal for a 944TS?  If not what 
     is normal and what could be wrong?
     
          2)  The steering wheel vibrated at speeds over 50 MPH.  The owner
     had the stock wheels re-finished but never had balancing weights 
     installed when the tires were mounted.  I found this to be very odd as 
     the cost of mounting usually includes a high speed balance. In the 944 
     FAQ there is mention of a problem causing the wheel to shimmy at higher 
     speeds.  If I can talk the owner into getting them balanced, and the 
     wheels steering wheel still vibrates, what could the problem be?  
     
          3)  There are a set of four driving lights on the front.  The two 
     outer ones work, but the two inners do not work.  Are all four 
     supposed to work?
     
          4)  I called PCNA and verified the car is a genuine 944TS.  They 
     also gave me the 8 digit engine code.  This should be stamped on the 
     engine.  Where would it be located?
     
          5)  The oil pressure gauge stayed over 4 bar for the entire test 
     drive (about 1/2 hour), even at idle.  Is this normal?  He states he uses
     Mobil 1 10W/30 motor oil.  Also when I looked at the oil filter it was much 
     longer than the factory filter, and had a gray outer shell (I could not 
     make out the name brand).
     
          6)  There was a ticking noise from the top of the engine.  The 
     owner states it is the fuel system.  Is he correct?
     
     Thank you.
     
     Tom
