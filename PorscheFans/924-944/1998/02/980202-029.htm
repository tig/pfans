Or use a fine drill and install drain points in the lenses.

There is a factory goldfish food dispenser for the tail lights if you want
it.

	Subject:	Rear Tail Light Lens Removal

	Dear P fans,

	I know there was a discussion about this recently but I can't seem
to find
	it in my notes.  After a recent car wash/inspection session my son
noticed
	my '87 944NA has a good bit of water in the rear tail light.  I
guess I
	could put a few goldfish in there for that "70's retro look" but I'd
rather
	fix it.  I know that the gasket behind the lens will need replaced
to
	correct the problem.  I have pulled back the carpeting in the rear
and
	removed the bulb assembly and the (6) flare nuts from the back of
the lens
	assembly.  But the lens assembly still won't budge.  I tried some
light
	tapping with a rubber mallet on the back of te assembly but it
didn't seem
	to want to come out.  Before doing anything I might regret I thought
I would
	ask for advice (just guessing but I would assume this a "stupid"
priced
	part).  Is the assembly ready to come out and just needs a little
patient
	tapping/tugging or is there something else I'm missing.  I don't
have the
	repair manuals and of course my Haynes manual isn't very helpful.

	TIA.....
