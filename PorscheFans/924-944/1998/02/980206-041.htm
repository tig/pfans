Thanks, Doug, for the info and please do send me by email the three articles
you mention. I would appreciate a little more on what the "90 degree twist"
to set
the timing belt tension by hand means or how you apply it. What I do
understand is what 90 degrees is. What I don't understand is all the rest. 

I would presume that you first tension the belt, and then twist it, and if
it will twist 90 degrees with an amount of effort an average person might be
able to exert on the belt by hand, and between two rollers spaced a certain
distance apart, then it is about right. But where do you apply the twist, if
the rest is right? Or, how many inches of span between rollers do you want
where you twist?

Is the balance belt done the same way? Is it less critical? Is it 90
degrees, too? Where do you twist or how many inches between the rollers?

When you set the tension with the tool, does the tool appear to be a device
that measures tension ("push" on the belt)? Could the amount of push
(tension) be duplicated with the fish scale approach mentioned by another
fan below? I.e.: is the 9201 tool more like a spring-loaded thing which
pushes against the belt and shows you by a reading when the right number of
pounds of pressure are being exerted, or is it more like a torque-wrench?
Either way, could the amount of pressure be measured with a scale and
applied with some other available tool such as an extension handle? [Then
checked afterward by the 90 degree twist.]

It would be helpful to have the instructions on tensioning with the 9201
tool, too. It might explain something I am missing.

I think you are being properly cautious when you say that the 90 degree
twist test was recommended for a different and less damage-susceptible
engine, but is the 90 degree twist on the 928 a comparable VALUE compared
with the 944 (that is, is the distance between the appropriate rollers the
same and the belt the same and the reading on the 9201 tool the same)?

What about the belt difference described by Steve Timmins ("new" belts don't
have the same history of breaking, and now have steel in them where they had
cotton-like material before)? Would the rule still apply? When you (or
Steve) last tested a new type belt did it still seem that 90 degrees was
about right? [Steve quoted below, too.]

From a fan who may wish to remain anonymous and quoting a former owner:

>He said the the Porsche tension tool can get various readings based on
where you place it on the belt.  I'm new to all this so I don't know.
>
>I do agree with you that there must be a low cost, and possibly more
accurate method to tensioning.  I had thoughts similar to your's-so much
force to deflect the bellt so far.  I was thinking that a digital fishing
scale, super accurate and cheap (~$40), could be used to measure the force
used to deflect the belt a given distance.  If someone with the P tool could
do a side by side comparison of both methods it might save us all a lot of $.
