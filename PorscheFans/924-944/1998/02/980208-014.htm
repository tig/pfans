Randall,

I thought you were converting from stock -- ahh ha.  You couldn't blow the
head gasket at 20-24 lbs? How long/miles did it last at that pressure? I
can't remember the pounds to bar conversion but isn't stock 951S about 14
lbs and 16 lbs w/ the APE Stage II, or something like that? I was also
curious if your head gasket was modified/O-ringed yet or not? As you didn't
have performance data, I imagine it never saw a dyno either -- that would
REALLY be interested. You've probably seen Farzaan's web page with dyno
graphs. They really are helpful.

Thanks for keeping us posted.
