In the particular sample above, U1 is the lower/main body color and V9
designates the black targa/cabriolet top.  In other words, the cars, at
least in the "earlier" years were given a double set of codes to handle the
two-tone concept.

Hopefully, I will be able to pick up a schedule of any new colors/codes
this weekend at the Chicago Auto Show, as I plan on attending on Saturday,
2/7.

The database I attached to my note last night was a compilation of assorted
color charts, brochures, and Porsche Fact Books I have accumulated over the
years, along with some information which has been submitted/volunteered by
other Pfans listmembers.  Unfortunately, I don't have a web page, so if
anyone else wants to add the data to theirs, be my guest.
