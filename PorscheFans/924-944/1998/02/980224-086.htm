<mwachholz@m-c-r-inc.com> so eloquently stated:

These rotor prices are "inflated" because of the cross drilling holes.
Standard 951S would be just as good or better at half the price.  =
Besides,
for all but really fast track work the stock brakes should work pretty
well.

This is correct.  I priced the rear shocks, helper springs and mounts
today.  The shocks are about $121 each, the springs $112 pair, and the
mounts $27 each.  These are 20% off prices from Sonnen Motorcars.

Mostly because of the rear pseudo coil over shocks and the bigger front
and rear stabilizer bars.

I still think you are wrong about this.  According to my dealer the 968
M030 has the 44/36 pistons just like the 951S.

RD Enterprises in San Diego has the front 951S Koni sport struts in

OK, I'll bite.  How?
