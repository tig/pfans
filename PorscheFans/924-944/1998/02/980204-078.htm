<< I think the
 leather was not taken care of at some time and the leather dried and created
a
 small tear at the seam. I have had it looked at by an upholstery shop, and
 they said the entire seat would need to be recovered. The cost was some where
 around $1200 for both. Since I have the Porsche sport seats, I dont want to
 just change them out, but are there any good cover kits out there that dont
 look really bad? >>

I don't know where or how bad the "small tear" is but there are ways of
repairing leather that are undetectible.  I'm in the furniture business and
there are people who can repair leather that even I find it hard to believe .
.. . . . I've seen holes as large as a nickel filled, grained and dyed that
cannot be detected.  Before you resort to the expense of the upholstery shop,
check with a furniture store in your area that does alot of business in
leather . . . . . they should be able to put you in contact with someone who
knows what they're doing and won't go laughing all the way to the bank with
your money.

Good Luck,
