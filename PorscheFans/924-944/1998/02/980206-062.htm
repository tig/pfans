On the topic of 944 VS 944S's, I think we need to either keep the comparison
between these two models, or open it to all models. If you wish to compare
only the 944 and 944S, why would you not go with the S? Yes there are
maintanance advantages to the 8 valve engine, but for all the other benefits,
its worth it. I have had the privilidge of my way up the marque food chain, I
started with a 924. I will say that all of my cars are kept in excellent
condition. This way they are all on the same playing  field for this
comparison. The 924 was nice, it was quick, but lacked the handling of either
of the other two cars. The 944 was a large improvement in both handling and
speed. Not to mention the interior and exterior styling. Now that I own a 1987
944S, I can say it is the best so far. I have recently driven a 1989 951. And
it is definately a faster car at the top, but I would still prefer my S off
the line. The key to this comparison MAINTANANCE IS THE KEY! If you keep your
car in the shape it should be kept, go with the S. 
On the topic of personalized plates. I have a California personalized plate
that says MY 944S. I am going to be purchasing a 951 soon, and the plate will
be hanging on the wall in my office unless someone from the list would like it
on there car. I will not sell it to be used as a wall hanger, but it does look
great on a car. If you are interested, let me know. You will only need to pay
the transfer fee. I dont want any money for it.
