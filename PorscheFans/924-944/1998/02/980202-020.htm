Definitely an overboost condition...

Your klr is limiting boost in order to save the engine...

Your wastegate may be stuck, or nonfunctional... No reason to take
the head off.

Take it to a good mechanic. Stop wasting your money on bad mechanics...

Good Luck!

> Spark - ok
> Boost - ok, not going into an over boost condition
> Most vacuum lines replaced - no change in problem
> Turbo boost timer delay valve replaced - no change
> Throttle position switch replace - no change
