pfolks,
Roxanne and I may be the only two interested in this but I am posting to =
the list in case someone else needs to do the same repair.

I finally got around to doing something about my shifter trim. If you rec=
all after having the interior redone the upholsterer glued down the shift=
 trim carpet and the plastic trim piece that is normally under the carpet=
 he left on top not fixed down.

I hope to someday get it back to original so this may only be a temporary=
 fix. I used Velcro strips. I found the Velcro in the fabric section of =
a local discount store. It comes in a roll with an adhesive backing. I =
cut the roll lengthwise down the middle because the strips need to be nar=
rower than the roll of Velcro. Then just cut lengths of Velcro to fit aro=
und the perimeter of the trim piece. Remember you have two parts to Velcr=
o--the hook side, and the loop side. It doesn't matter which goes on whic=
h surface. But you need to cut strips of the other part to match the stri=
ps on the trim piece and then stick these down onto the carpet in the app=
ropriate position to match to the trim piece.

To get the best results the Velcro should completely surround the bottom =
perimeter of the shifter trim piece.

It seems to be doing the job. It holds well and it makes the shift trim =
removable. So I'm satisfied for now.

BTW, I recall there should be another plastic piece that the shift trim =
snaps down onto. When I got the car back this piece was missing. I don't =
remember what it looks like. Can someone describe it to me?
