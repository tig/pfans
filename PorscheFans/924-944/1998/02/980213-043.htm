As I was thinking about the last long trip my 944 and how comfortable, I am
reminded of a very quite race I ran as a navigator, it was a best time run
no classes, no handicap. The Track was the US from Conn. to California, and
we did it in an MG-TC. The 914 with headers has more heat, twice the leg
room, and a good 10" of more space between the driver and passenger. Yes it
was damn tight!

We did it in 36h 8min, and then hired a truck to take the car back because
we both refused to get back in the car. In fact we parked the car and took a
cab to the hotel from the finish line, but then again we had been drinking a
bit.

	Hello everyone,

	I'm moving from Portland to Iowa at the end of this month - and want
to 
	drive my newly purchased '86 951, by way of San Francisco, Phoenix, 
	Witchita, then to Cedar Falls.

	(shipping all my belongings, including my '79 Corvette direct.)

	Has anyone experienced any problems long distance driving a 951
(4000 
	miles in ten days, at least), besides the occasional speeding
ticket?

	All of your input would be greatly appreciated. And if any of you
are in 
	those cities, I'd be happy to met for beer!

	All the best,

	John Carroll
	mailto:jcarroll7@hotmail.com

	'86 Blk 951
	'79 Forrest Green Corvette

	By the way - anyone know of good mechanic in Eastern Iowa?
