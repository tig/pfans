For the guy in Hawaii who was talking about moving to a different tire
rating and someone replied suggesting going to the same size tires front
and rear.  I don't know about the ratings but I do have some experience
with running the same size tires.  When I purchased my 88 951, it had
225/50s all around, 3 SP8 and 1 RE940.  It sucked!  Tramlined like a son of
a gun.  I took the best 2 SP8s and put them on the front and put 245/45 on
the rears and I'm much happier.  Still tramlines a bit but not as much and
the handling felt more stable.  Now that I've got the new tires on, the old
setup felt a bit squirrely as if the suspension was spending longer looking
for an equilibrium point when tracking in corners.  And this was at
reasonable speeds on the street, not the track.

P.S.  I've still got an almost new RE940 sitting in my garage. I don't know
what possessed me to keep it except it was almost new.  Anybody wants it,
it's theirs for the cost of shipping UPS.  I'm in central CA.
