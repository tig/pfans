Hi Pfans.. Allow me to vent for a few minutes, if you would...

Could somebody please explain what requires every single IDIOT on the
roads in this town to:
a) tailgate behind me, when I'm already speeding anyway
b) Make a big deal of pushing their Geo Metro to its limits to pass a
Porsche
c) at yield on left turn intersections, not yield, just turn at their
whim. No signals, of course
d) pull right into the nice space I allow between me and the driver in
front of me
e) demonstrate the wonderful acceleration of their '81 Citation by
merging onto the freeway at 50 mph
f) use their high beams as a substitute for a burned out headlight
g) slam on their brakes at the sight of an accident on the shoulder, a
person changing a flat tire, the Highway Patrol, CalTrans trimming
trees, or a tow truck.

Speaking of trucks, I would appreciate it if they didn't pull up right
behind me as I'm doing 75 in the fast lane, wait for me to move to the
next lane, pass me, then pull in front of me and slow to 60. It's really
annoying. And while I'm in a bad mood, would it really kill CalTrans to
fix the 101 through Santa Barbara in stretches of more than 50 feet at a
time? You guys spent years ripping up the freeway, widened it a little
in some places, but ignored the potholes that are big enough to fall
into. I do like how they left the marks from the old lane reflectors
that they pulled out. It's funny to watch people try and drive in the
"old lanes."
	
Sorry about the bandwidth, guys, but I'm just really pissed (and a bit
shaken) by nearly getting mashed by a moron in a trashed out old van
with one headlight, who decided to turn left without signalling on a
yield on left turn intersection as I was driving through it, forcing me
to squeal into an illegal left turn the wrong way down a one way street,
thankfully empty at the time. HANG UP THE PHONE AND DRIVE, PEOPLE!

Alex.
