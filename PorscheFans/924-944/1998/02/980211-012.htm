P-Fans,

Well, I'm back at the homestead again and, although this has been a "dead
issue" since I left, I do want to make good on my promised to bring together
some of the really great information so many have contributed on
the "great transmission debate" lately. In particular, Clark Fletcher and
Guenter Berner sorted through a lot of conflicting information to finally
bring us a very accurate summary of the alternatives. And Tom Putz even gave
us the formula so we could do our own calculations. Great job guys and
thanks from all of us following this thread. Before summarizing the info,
though, I have another idea to throw into the fire -- changing the 951 gear
set.

I spoke with Chris Fisher at Powerhaus II (says they're not directly
connected to Powerhaus?) as they advertise gearsets and transmissions for
911's. The have a custom gearset available for the 951 that is designed
primarily for the track. It includes new gears for 3rd, 4th & 5th with
ratios of 1.58;  1.29;  .96. When used with the stock 3.375 ring and pinion
and stock 1st and 2nd gears, this setup provides much more tightly spaced
gearing (close-ratio) for 2nd through 5th. This has been a popular (so how
many have done this?) revision for the track by giving 4 useable gears. With
the new gears, the 951 tranny would have final drive ratios of 11.81;  6.95;
5.33;  4.35;  3.24. Notice how close 2nd, 3rd and 4th are, and even 5th
isn't far off.

After comparing the statistics Guenter and Clark arrived at, they appear to
closely agree when you account for the differences in rpm, and to be quite
accurate. (I haven't verified his math for top speeds, but we haven't heard
from our mathemetician Tom Putz regarding the theoretical speeds so I expect
they are pretty good data.) The Excellence info was not so excellent. I've
decided to reprint Clark's because I agree that selecting a constant tire
size and rpm is the only way to realistically COMPARE the alternatives.
Given all the variables when comparing top speeds, I also like the
theoretical speed comparison because it eliminates those variables and
improves the quality of the data points.

correct ratio is .829, but the data has not been re-calculated.)

This data is quite insightful, but I have re-charted the final drive ratios
to try and give us a
clearer picture when comparing the different choices available:

Ratios Compared      1st      2nd      3rd       4th        5th       6th
Stock 951 w/3.375   11.81   6.95     4.73     3.49     2.80     --
Stock 951 w/3.89     13.61   8.00     5.44     4.02     3.22     --
Custom gear/3.375  11.81   6.95     5.33     4.35     3.24     --
6-speed w/3.778      12.02   7.56     5.42     4.20     3.45    2.93

Another way to compare the information is to look at the size of the "steps"
between gears. The advantages of a close-ratio gearbox allowing an engine to
remain in it's power band is a widely recognized. The following chart
shows us how big the steps are:

Steps Compared       1st-2nd     2nd-3rd     3rd-4th     4th-5th     5th-6th
Stock 951 w/3.375       4.86           2.22          1.24          .69
Stock 951 w/3.89         5.61           2.56          1.42          .80
Custom gear/3.375      4.86           1.62            .98        1.11
6-speed w/3.778          4.46           2.14          1.22          .75
..52

Lastly, speeds in gears is a way for us to translate the ratios into a "real
world" situation by giving us a rough idea of our shift points. This might
arguably be our least reliable data but it's provided as yet another
potentially useful point to compare. I'm using Clark's THEORETICALspeeds in
mph:

Speeds Compared    1st      2nd      3rd       4th      5th       6th
Stock 951 w/3.375     40       68       100     136      169
Stock 951 w/3.89       35       59          87     117      147
Custom Gear/3/375   40       68          90     111      147
6-speed w/3.778        39       63          87     113      137    161

As I review this info, the stock setup provides a reasonable compromise
between acceleration and top speed, and is a nice overall box. The 3.89
conversion provides stronger acceleration but sacrifices highway speed and
comfort, however it exagerates the steps between gears which means more
difficulty finding the right gear on the track and in the twistys. The
custom gears give stronger acceleration for 3rd-5th and retain a more track
useable 2nd gear. Highway speed and comfort is lost as with the 3.89. With
2-3 and 3-4 being so close they should offer the best track performance.

I like the 6-speed best because the ratios are much closer than the stock
transmission and nearly equal to the custom track gears. And with a 6th
ratio, highway performance isn't sacrificed. First is nearly the same as
stock, 2nd will pull harder than anything except the 3.89, 3rd will pull as
hard as the 3.89;  4th runs nearly as good as the custom set;  5th will pull
the same as the stock 4th gear;  and 6th provides just a little compromise
in top speed.

What's it cost and is it "worth it"?

I don't have many final figures, but the 3.89 ring and pinion sells for
about $1200. The custom track gears cost $2685. The 6-speed sells used for
about $3000 but also requires the 968 shift linkage and half-shafts and a
custom machined adapter between the torque tube and the tranny which ought
to bring it to about $4000+. All would also require installation labor --
your's or their's.

"Is it worth it" is subjective -- of course it depends on how much you have
and your priorities. But are there real world advantages that are
significant?  I pulled out Farzaan's dyno charts, and found the 951S w/APE
stage II is within 10% of peak torque from 3500 to 5500rpm and has lost 35%
below 3000rpm;  and within 10% of peak horsepower from 4500 to 6000rpm and
has lost more than 50 hp below 3000rpm. Stock, the  differences are even
greater.

My conclusion is I doubt the 6-speed is going to have as much effect on zero
to whatever speeds as $4000+ spend directly on the engine. However, when it
comes to real world spirited driving, either on the track or street, I have
to think having the right gear always available would significantly improve
the performance. I hope to locate a six-speed and make the change myself...
and of course I'll certainly keep everyone posted if I do.
