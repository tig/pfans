Carl and P-Fans,

I, too, was bothered by the lack of the little plastic covers.  Much to my
amazement, I found three wrecked 924's in the local salvage yard and was able to
retreive four of these items along with a headlight motor relay, a rear lid
release linkage and a driving light lens for $20.  I love junk yards!!
