Hi all!

Was underneath my '86 951 this weekend, cleaning off the oil and 
sludge from a leak (that hopefully I fixed) and noticed a 
problem.  I'm just learning with 'my baby' so you'll have to forgive 
my overall ignorance, but as I was looking up at what I assumed was 
the steering rack, I noticed what looks like a hard, black plastic 
tube, about the diameter of a pencil, it's strapped to the rack and 
on each end has a fitting that makes a 90 degree turn and goes into a 
hole in the rack.  The problem is that on the passenger side, the 
fitting has come out of the hole, and no matter how hard I pulled.  I 
couldn't 'stretch' this tube far enough so that the fitting would go 
back into the hole.  If I kept up, I knew I would break something.  
So, I know this is something that needs to be fixed, but what is this 
tube, what purpose does it serve, and how quickly must I get it 
fixed?  I've had the car for about 4 1/2 months now, and I'm sure the 
PO never looked into it.  

thanks for any advice,

Jim Crow
