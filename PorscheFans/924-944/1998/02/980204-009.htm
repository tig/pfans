  Once the belt is properly tensioned, use a feeler gage to set the distance 
from the belt to the roller to ~0.5mm. The roller is there to help dampen belt 
flapping, but is not meant to be in constant contact with the belt.

According to the Factory workshop manuals, the tension set with this tensioner 
is correct for a new belt. I re-tensioned after ~200 miles, then at a ~2,000 
miles. Checking the tension often is the best way to prevent belt failure, 
plus you can inspect for damage, oil, etc...

>7.  How do I replace the bulb behind the clock (87 style dash)?

You will need to remove the piece of plastic trim that covers the front of the 
clock to gain access to the screws holding the clock in place. The screws 
holding the plastic trim in place are located on the left under the heater 
control faceplate, and on the right behind the little plastic cover under the 
passenger side heater vent, and on the dash on the far right surface (open the 
passenger door to see them). There is also a screw behind the little round 
lovered cover for the interior temperature sensor, carefully rotate it counter 
clockwise to remove it for access to the screw. With the clock removed, it 
should be obvious what to do. I don't recall if the glove box had to be 
removed to get the clock out. If you need more details let me know and I will 
take a look at my dash to remind myself of the details..

Good Luck,
 Ezra
