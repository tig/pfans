I've never dont anything with the rear speakers, so I can't help in that
department (although they're the missing link in my stereo, so they will be
done soon), but for the fronts I used Boston Acoustic 4x6 plate speakers.
I don't recall the part number off hand, but if oyu want I can find it.
I've seen them at most Good Guys and some Best Buys even.  The screw holes
in the plate weren't quite positioned right, so I had to drill some myself,
but it's thin plastic, only took a few seconds.  Polk Audio also makes a
component 4x6 plate speaker with the same form factor.

These are very good quality speakers in my opinion, and can sound every bit
as full as a cheaper (Sony or Pioneer class) 6x9.  Admittedly, they don't
quite get the bass, but an oval shaped 6x9 sounds like crap with bass.  I
went with a single Polk 8" subwoofer to cover the bass.  But then again, I
was just looking for a full, tight, accurate sound over the entire
frequency range, not a boom box on four very expensive wheels.
