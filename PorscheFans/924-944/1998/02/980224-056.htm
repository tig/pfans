I should leave this alone, but thought I needed to add a few cents more for
the 911 listers.

>Normally, I'm pretty "middle of the road" when it comes to these debates,

I wouldn't exactly say you were "middle" of the road, I think we could both
move a little closer to the middle.

>"may even be faster"?  Try, "it IS faster".  My 951 and every chipped 951
>in the world has more HP and Torque at the rear wheels than the C2 or C4
>has at the flywheel! 

Lets compare apples to apples here, most stock 944 turbos have 207 HP and
poor torque versus stock 964's with 250HP and fairly strong torque curves.
Once you start talking modifications, only money and driveability limit HP.
 If you have a "S" or '89 Turbo you are closer in HP, but most only have
the 207.

>While the 911 sound is excellent, a 951 on full boost is Ferrari like in
>pitch and 911 like in depth, hard to describe, just very 962 like.

This is where you are way off middle of the road.  A 4 cylinder turbo
sounds like a 12 cylinder Ferrari, come on.

I live in San Diego, so rain is not a factor (well usually not, El Nino
seems to be over, clear skies for next week or two now).  I agree here, the
C2 allows for more tail out track driving.  I just like the C4 for a
change.  I have had 4 rear wheel drive Porsches and loved them.  Got a
Quattro which is terribly underpowered but fun in corners so I thought the
C4 would be a nice change.  Getting on the gas earlier in corners is more
of a rush, FOR ME, than the hinderance of weight takes away.

Aesthetics aside, I have not read of that much of a difference in the 964
vs 993 performance.  The 993 has 30 more HP and 6 speeds, but weighs more.
Road and Track has better 0-60 times for the 964 than the 993's.  Don't
remember the other performance criteria comparison.  Of course I would
rather have the 993, but the price difference of $20k and more depreciation
was just not justifiable for my limited income, which in my opinion is the
best arguement you can make as to why the 951 is better than the C4 --price--.
