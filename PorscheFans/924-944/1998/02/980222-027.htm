Wow, Adrien, you are a real macho hotshot. So you you're speaking of your
own experience driving them, then?

You have to ask the question why... is it because there's so little demand
(which is what I have concluded), or because nobody who wants them can find
them? I know of two that are sitting begging right now, both beautiful cars.

Au contraire, ours is worth more today than we paid nearly two years ago.

I've owned both a 91 Lotus Esprit and a 94 NSX... and unlike the Speedster,
they both had door handles and power mirrors.  Sexy... don't you want to
damn the Lotus for only being 4 cylinders despite its massive horsepower?
I'll give you the fact that a Lotus still smells like leather, wonderful
Connoly leather, even seven years from the factory, but that's as far as
I'll go.  Other than that, you don't know what in the heck you're talking
about.
