 Help!!!!!

Will "normal" (not M030) struts from the Turbo fit an S2??? There are
different dimensions to the strut housings and the lengths of the struts...
by 50mm.  The control arms are the same... the top hats are the same... the
spindles are the same... but the springs are different lengths... and the
strut housings are different lengths... so, could they still work when
everything else is the same?????  By the way... I wouldn't mind dropping
the car 3/4 of an inch in front or so if that comes as a result.   Will
there be any alignment problems?  And would it be aligned to S2 or Turbo
specs???

It would be nice if this would work... as it would open uo the aftermarket
world for springs, etc.  Currently, this is a real problem with S2's... as
there are no aftermarket companies who make items like springs for the S2
(and if they exist... I sure don't know who they are!!!! I have spent a lot
of time looking!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

  If you can be of further assistance... please don't hesitate to respond.
It will be very  greatly appreciated.

Thank you.
