Would you not know it?  This morning I found the battery in my 951 dead
(maybe I should not have fixed the clock last week :-) ).  Eventually I
got a new one in and took the car to the shop for belts/alignment.

Apparently, the weep hole on the water pump shows signs of having leaked
in the past.  I thought the new pumps were supposed to last for a long
time (longer than 30000 miles).  The catch is, there are no records of
what kind of a pump was used (new/rebuilt/Porsche-brand/bubba-brand, etc.) 
I have told the shop to go ahead and replace the pump, am I being
over-cautious?  I just wish they had a decent PCA discount.  Hopefully,
this pump will last me a long, long time( at least 60,000 miles)

The morale of this story as I see it:
1) I am happy I did not pay much for this car.  I knew the belt service
was overdue and had questions about the quality of the water pump.
2) Deduct for lack of proper maintenance records when buying(ie what water
pump was used?)
3) Keep some extra cash in the bank after buying in case things come up.

I am still happy I bought the car, but I am starting to feel a little bit
like Lee. I have driven it only about 50 miles. :-( At least I get Monday
off (President's Day) when I get to pick up the car. :-)  If it is dry I
hope to spend some time waxing it!
