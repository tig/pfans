<< I guess I'm like the parents of the story.  I'm not getting rid of the car.
 I love it just as much, but now I... how can I phrase it?  My baby isn't
 perfect.  I guess I've lost a little pride in it as now when I see other
 951s I'll know that mine is rebuilt and theirs (probably) isn't. >>

First of all, your car is the same one you had before you spent the $12.50 for
the report.  You shouldn't feel any different about it now and it certainly
shouldn't diminish your pride in it.  It's still a Porsche and it's "family
tree" is the same regardless of how it's been treated.

Secondly, no one's car is "perfect" so don't ever think it is.  You might be
surprised to find out that the "other 951" had a harder life than yours did!
Enjoy your "baby" for the fine heritage it stands for and just think of
yourself as it's current caretaker . . . . . it's your job to keep it on the
road in the finest condition you can.

Ask any parent of a handicapped child and they will tell you that they
couldn't love the child more even if it was "perfect".
