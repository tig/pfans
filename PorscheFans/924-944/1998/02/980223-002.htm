>Thanks for the advice. The question was whether the 94 Speedster Cab was
the right one for me.  It was arrestingly beautiful, but after driving it I
decided that having an armrest, a door handle, and power side mirrors
--comfort items, all-- were too important to me.  The Speedster is a
stripped-down sports convertible two seater with a fiberglass rear cover
that hides the convertible top and curves around the two seats. There were
only 409 made in 94.  I'm looking for a true sports car, not luxury, but I
expect to keep it for ten years and that's just too long to me to go
without ever resting my elbows.
If you've never driven an NSX, especially on a track, you really are
missing something.  It takes your breath away. You have never felt a sports
car hug the track like the NSX.  You can take a cloverleaf exit ramp at 90
mph and feel as if you are going 25. There are specific reasons why you can
do that--much having to do with special tires, two intentionally toed in
and the other two toed out, each specially made for their corner of the
car, and they last only 6,000-12,000 miles. It is nearly impossible to
break contact with the pavement, but once you do, it is spectacular, and
not in the good sense.  The car gives even a poor driver total control.
Which is one reason so many people condemn these wonderful cars. We stand
on the sidelines and mutter, "that didn't require any skill" as they
consistently make excellent track times. If skill was truly the sole
standard, then getting a good track time in a Pinto would be the ultimate
macho track test.
No, the NSX is condemned because it is too perfect. Other than the
intentional "tire wear problem," it has no foibles or quirks or bugs
affectionately known as "features." That makes it seem personality-less.
On the other hand, the Porsche's strong personality has been loved despite
its oddities, its quirks, funny shape, air cooled engine, fake air
conditioning, throw-back analog gadgetry, and off-balance weight and engine
placement that makes it so easy to spin on the track. Or perhaps _because
of_ these things.
The 944 is the Boxster of yesteryear.  It fixed many of the 911's quirks
with a water cooled engine, real AC, and well-balanced front engine
placement. This is why so many serious racers drive 944's on the
track--they have the advantages of the 911, but without the drawbacks.
Most of the 911's on the track are just people who want to drive their car
as close to its limits as they dare, because it takes serious, serious
skill to overcome its disadvantages and truly race a 911.<

Kerry,
      While you're at it, maybe you should sell the 944 and get 300 ZX.
Let's face it, the 944 has more "quirks and bugs" than the 300 ZX so, it
only seems the logical thing to do.
