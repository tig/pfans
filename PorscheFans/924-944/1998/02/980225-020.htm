   I don't know about Windward's turbo.  I call Windward and talk to a computer.  I
call PowerHaus and talk to David Reins, the owner.  Adapters were included, not
worth $500.00.  Adapters were my biggest problem with the Turbo.  The coolant temp
probe was great, the stock one is too tall, PowerHaus Probe easily fits under
manifold.  The adapter for the intake air on front of turbo was a problem but after
much aggravation and modifying the adaptor with my crude tools I made it work.
I've complained to PH abouth this adaptor but I guess its all they've got.  You
have to cut off the J-pipe beween air flow meter and intake of turbo and adapt it
to fit the larger intake of the K-27.  With the parts PH sends you it is a problem.

  I'm not sure what is doing what since I did several things at once.  Also I've
not had the mixture adjusted since the project and my Autothority upgrade chips for
the K-27 are due in today I hope.  The car idles fine, very steady with just a
small amount greater vibration than before, hardly noticeable.  I'm not sure if
this is the lightened flywheel and clutch or not.  I had my mechanic change my
timing belts.  He told me the balance shafts were off by one tooth, I wonder if the
were better before he changed it.  Again the vibration is so small I'm not going to
worry about it.

  The car is a joy to drive, the low end response feels like I've added two
cylinders.  I'm not sure if the K-27 is helping or not, but the other mods I think
were well worth it.  I was boosting 24 lbs before and I am running about 16-17 lbs
now.  The car felt faster before, but 24lbs is too much.
I also got new tires which are a lot stickier so I don't get as much wheel spin.  I
was breaking them loose in 3rd gear before, now they don't break in 2nd.  They tell
me I need a mass flow sensor to realize the benefits of the K-27.  I bought one of
the first Mass flow sensors from Autothority several years ago and it did not do
anything I could feel except make a lot of hissing noises which I hated.  I believe
it would help the K-27 now but the car feels so good and sounds so fine I'm just
going to run it the way it is now and enjoy it.  Farzaan is right it does have a
Ferrari like sound especially in the higher gears, or maybe like a big inline four
cylinder bike with a Kerkur Header.  I've tried to schedule a Dyno but it seems
almost impossible in Memphis.  There is no stall or hesitation of any sort in this
car, it feels like I have a new car and I look forward to driving it all the time.
I can't wait for the next drivers ed.

   If I were you, I would start out with a good aftermarket boost gauge and
chips(if you don't already have).  Drill the cycling valve or buy one already
drilled from PH and change to 3 Bar fuel pressure regulator and update the
Compressor Bypass valve to the 993 valve.  Also get a Bursch Cat bypass pipe(cheap
mod and well worth it).  I learned a lot of this stuff from reading Farzaan's
post.  Try running up to 17lbs boost and using octane boost to lessen chance of
detonation and see if you like it.

   I would also recomment the lightweight clutch and flywheel plus the ExtrudeHone
manifold and O-ringed flow Matched Head with increased compression(8.3:1).  These
are more expensive and serious mods though, and you may be happy with less.  I
believe they are the mods that helped out my low end so much though and that is
what really makes the car so much more fun to drive.  I'm still undecided about the
K-27, I think there is a little more lag but I've got the stronger bottom end and
the lag is of less concern, but I wonder what my current setup would feel like with
the K26.
  I believe everyone is right about the MFS being what the K-27 needs.  The barn
door air sensor is my last bottleneck and I'm sure I will eventually try one.  Good
luck with whatever you decide.
