Subject:  RE: A pillar screw

Mark,
      If the screw you are referring to is much larger than the other two,
it is probably a plug.  On the cars that were not equipped with rear seat
shoulder harnesses, a large screw was used to cover the hole for the
shoulder harness mounting point. On my car, this plug/cover screw is made
of plastic. You may be able to force a larger allen head into the hole or
drive a large flat tip screwdriver into the hole with a hammer. If yours is
similar to mine, you shouldn't have any trouble driving something into the
soft plastic to get it out.

Good Luck,
Clark Fletcher
