Years ago, a well-respected mechanic and so-called "expert" at the local
Porsche dealership once told me that 924s and 944s were actually
assembled at the Audi factory, under contract from Porsche, although
the 968 was constructed "in-house".

I'm sure someone will tell me if this is not true.


>To what I recall fm some of the "944" history books that I have at home,
>the only thing that really was considered to be of non-Porsche was the
>gearbox or transaxle as it is normally called. The transaxle is Audi
>designed and built, at least to what I remember. The 944's engine
>starting fm the 2.5L on up was all original Porsche, unlike the 924
>which had a VW designed engine and built by Audi. The 924 project was
>bought fm VW by Porsche. So, one could say that the original concept of
>the 924 could be thought of as VW? We all know that the 944 was really
>the first water-cooled production car that was world-wide accepted as a
