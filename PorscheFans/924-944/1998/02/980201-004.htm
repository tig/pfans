	Sometime ago my friend and I Slick 50'd a late model Mazda that he had.
This car had belonged to his mother, it was well serviced and was not
run hard. It met its end less than 10,000 miles later. We opened up the
engine to find out what went wrong. The inside looked as though it had
been caramelized. The build up around the engine rings had caused them
to fail scoring the bore of one of the cylinders badly. YOU can take
your chances with additives and treatments but I'll stick with regular
oil changes and PULP ( premium unleaded petrol ).
	On the liner front, I noticed in a back issue of European Car ( can't
remember issue # ) that the new Merc V engines are aluminum with a
ALUSIL type liner. The liner appeared to be about 1/4  inch thick. Now
wouldn't be nice if Porsche had though of this way back when they
designed our blocks.
