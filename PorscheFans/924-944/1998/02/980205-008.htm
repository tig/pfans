Hi Porshe Fans,

I am new to the cult just having purchased a '87 924S.  The car is perfect
with 89K on the odometer and has sucked me in, for life.  I can not see my
garage without a Porshe in it again.

My question is this.  The past 2 days when I start up the car the Oil
Warning light starts blinking.  It is a constant blink about one a second. 
The Oil Pressure reads 5 (bar?) and their is plenty of oil in the motor. 
Is this a warning light for time to change the oil or a bad sending unit or
could it be a faulty wire or worse case not enough oil flow in the engine.

I have really learned a lot about this series of Porshe since becoming a
member of the newsgroup.  I enjoy in reading all of the advice and tips
discussed here.
