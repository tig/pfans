Did anyone else go??
I'm only about an hour away and went yesterday the only day I was able =
to go. It didn't dawn on me til I was half way there that I should have =
asked the list BEFORE Mardi Gras if anyone was going.
We could have had a mini Porschefans meet. Well definately next year we'l=
l need to plan something ahead of time. If you haven't been to Mardi Gras=
 there is nothing like it. You've got to experience it.
Anyway I didn't see any other P cars. Not even air cooled?! A white 98 =
vette pulled up beside me and for a moment out of the corner of my eye =
thought it was a 968. But alas it wasn't. I was on Canal St. (lots of ped=
estrians) so no stop light racing but don't think I would have challenged=
 him anyway :)
