I want to change the transaxle oil and coolant in my 84 NA 944
What oil should I use? I have quite a bit of caltex hypoid? at home
it says high quality etc also suitable for LSD (which my car is NOT).
Castrol is also easily available.
I'm also going to dump the cooling system and flush it.
What coolant is safe for the engine. The porsche dealer
here recommended the pre-mixed BP coolant, the parts guy
(who I have quite a bit of faith in said not to worry about
mixing it myself-I think he thinks I couldn't mix a solution!)
The most commonly available coolants here are:
Castrol.
BP.
tectaloy (a local brand I don't have much faith in)
The castrol is the easiest to find, BP I'd have to look around
for. I can also usually find american products if I look hard!

Please reply to the list or to me direct.
