I found it amusing that someone else just tried this change. I have a =
1991 S2 that had the Bosch platinum plugs (WR5DP with ~ 10,000 miles on =
them) when I purchased the car last November. I had heard poor reports =
on the platinum plugs because the platinum electrode is so thin that it =
does not provide a broad spark front. So last week I installed the Bosch =
tri-tips. (FR5DTC, I could not find the WR5DTC's. The only deference =
between the "F" and the "W" is the "F" has a 16mm hex head and the "W" =
has a 21mm head. Anyway I diverge.) I had heard that the tri-tips were =
specifically designed for 4-valve heads. Does any one know if this was =
true? I used the FR5DTC's instead of the WR7DTC's to stay in the same =
heat range as the original plugs. The FR5DTC's are also used by the C2 =
and C4's

My seat of the pants analysis is that the engine runs much smother and =
has a much more linear power curve. I have know way of telling if the =
total output at full throttle is any greater as I have not yet clocked =
the car. Anyone else with comments?
