Howdy

For the driving lights (next to fogs):
I made the reflector and
adjuster system from a generic driving light set.  
(can buy new lens/reflector @ 130 ea.)

I then ran wiring to the fuse box.  

Using the Porsche factory schematics for ROW cars:

Special modificatins were made both to the
underside of the fuse box AND to that
doggle plug (bridge) to make the 
allready included (there but unused in US)
high beam aux relay
behave correctly.  (aux driving light 
come on only with HB and not with
rear defroster on)

A doggle/bridge from a ROW car would
be easier than the modification to US version!

The H4 headlights plug in (relay optional
for high wattage bulbs)

ALL THIS APPLIES TO A '86 951

I'm in the process of putting driving lights in my '89 S2. I've gone 
over the 
factory wiring diagrams in the workshop manuals and also talked to some 
people who 
have the combo lights up front. You're right--- there are two switchs to 
the left of 
the light switch. one is fogs, the other is the rear fog. There is no 
switch for the 
driving lights -- they come on with the high-beams only.... I'm trying 
to set mine 
up on a seperate switch so I can keep them off in town ( especially if I 
use 100wt 
bulb). The wiring for the different lighting configurations (ROW, Japan, 
US, ect ) 
seems to center around the G6 relay/bridge in the fuse box. 

This weekend I'm going to look for the connector up front for the 
driving lights. I 
don't think Porsche would have different harnesses for the different 
markets. I have 
a fuse in the slot for driving lights in my car. I've checked, and all 
the ROW 
relays are the same except the G6. I've been told that ROW cars use 2 G6 
type 
bridges. Haven't checked it out yet.... Since my chain tensioner let go 
a couple of 
weeks ago, the lights seem rather insignificant !!!!!
