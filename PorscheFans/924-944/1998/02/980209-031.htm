I'm sure it would be quite an endeavor, but there are a few ways this =
can be
done .. 1 would be pdf files (acrobat reader) .. the other would be HTML =
...
where the manuel can be recreated using straight text and scanned images =
for
the illistrations. this can be easily done... I would be more than happy =
to
create such a program(s) out of the 944 manuels have it cut into cdroms =
and
make them available to the list for the cost of the blank cd's (approx =
$20
each) .. the only problem I can see would be with copyrights and such ..

I happen to have the manuals, a scanner and a CD-RW. I thought about the =
feasibility of producing the CD's since I remember having to wait a year =
to get my copy. It would be nice to have a second copy that I could get =
all greasy anyway. The problem is that each volume is approx. 200 double =
sided pages with about an average of 2 pictures per page. Times 6 =
volumes (non turbo type guy) this adds up to 2400 pages. I'm getting a =
headache!! Does anyone have an idea what format and what size each page =
would be when saved with graphics?? The real beauty of the manuals is =
the pictures that go with the text. (Thats why I opted against the micro =
method.)
Any great Ideas??
BTW- I typically get my blank CDRs for about $1 to a $1.50 each
