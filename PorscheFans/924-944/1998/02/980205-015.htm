Mitch,
	What most people think is :

1.	They go to the newspaper and look what others are asking for their
car.
2.	They then assume that their car is in much better shape than the
others, plus they bought the cool (sound system, wheels, trim, whatever).
3.	So their car is worth x grand more than what others are asking, they
print that in the paper and the cycle goes on.

	What happens is, they get a few people who look at the car offer
either a fair or low price, the owner blows them off and sits on the car for
a while, eventually they either use it as a trade in, where the dealer
inflates the new car or gives them wholesale for it, and they tell everyone
they got what they wanted for it.

	I have bought cars that had been on the market 9 months for a lot
less than what the first guy offered for it.

	My son is in the car business, and what they do when they see a
overpriced deal in the paper is call the guy up tell them they have a buyer
for the car, the guy brings the car over and the "Used car manager" looks it
over and gives the guy a real low ball offer. ( 2 or 3k under wholesale).

	The guy gets pissed off and leaves, they wait 2 - 3 weeks call the
guy up and say that the "manager" will split the difference between
wholesale and what he offered (800 - 1500) and the guy jumps at the deal.

	I have bought cars in the past year at these $'s
		83 - 944 (near perfect) $3000
	 	86 - Carrera (ready to go) $17.5k
		87 - 944S (needed clutch) $5000
		70 - 914/6 (original, needed rust work, motor freshing,
brakes, etc) $1650.

		All of these cars had not sold at what the owners thought
they were worth, and the owners were ready to move on. I view the upper
three ones as fair deals for both sides, the 6 is still a question, in that
I will have put $12k into by the time it hits the street.


	Regards,

Dan

	Sorry, guys, but the 944 is just not worth what you think it is.

	I agree that the car is the most bang for the buck, but that is
because
	prices are low.

	With regards to Mike Fields' post, sorry, but I just purchased an
east coast
	89 Turbo for $12,500.  While shopping for the car, I met a lot of
people
	that overpriced their car and were not interested in budging.  I
imagine
	they still have their ride, because more than one had the attitued
that they
	would rather mothball the car than let it go.  I suppose that they
think
	that the value will go up in a year or two?

	Look, the market sets the price, not Bruce, not you, and not me!  If
you
	feel bad, take heart, you could have bought the car new at $50k !

	Best,

	Mitch Tracy
