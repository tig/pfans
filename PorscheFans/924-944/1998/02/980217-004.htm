I have a '92 968, and I just ordered a set of 17" Forgelines w/ R1's.
With this increased grip, I figure I will need more braking power since
I should, in theory, be going faster around the track.  I've heard of
other 968 owners having trouble with the brake fluid boiling, and I
would like to avoid this problem at all costs.  I do not have the M030
package, so I have the "smaller" calipers up front.  I've been given a
few suggestions for increasing braking performance before moving to
928S4/951S calipers.  I would love to hear everyone's input and
suggestions on the following:

1)  Increase venting to the rotors.  The fellow I spoke with mentioned
adding a "vent" which is directed on the center of the rotors.  Since
heat is the big enemy of braking, this sounds logical.  Has anyone
performed such a modification on a 944 series car?

2)  Steel brake lines.  When the rubber lines get hot, they flex, thus
giving your brakes a "squishier" feel.  Steel brake lines are supposed
to alleviate this problem.  Again, anybody have any brand
recommendations?

3)  Motul (?) 600 brake fluid.  It's supposed to have a high 500's
(~580ish?) dry boiling point temp.  I believe this is higher that ATE
Super Blue, which I'm using now.  It's only $12ish per pint (or whatever
size it comes in) which is about the same as the super blue.  Castrol
600 is another option, but it's $60/pint.  Not cheap.  Any thoughts
here?

4)  Racing pads.  I've heard every opinion around about brake pads.  It
seems each person or group of people swear buy one brand or another.  Is
there any sort of consensus on this list?

5)  S4/951S Calipers.  Obviously the most expensive option due to the
necessary rotors, pads, and billet adapter which will accompany the
upgrade.  


Thanks for the input!
