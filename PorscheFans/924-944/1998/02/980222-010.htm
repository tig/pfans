Randall,
 In 97 my 86 951 was repainted. The color is guards red.
Before the repaint I checked a few shops that feature Glasurit and liked
the results, after all this is the factory paint. Then I checked out a
Sikkens job. The car looked as though it was still wet. Anyway in 97
the job cost about $3000.00. This price also included a new door sill.
They took any body rubber and plastic off before painting. The sikkens
paint job is not just a respray but a process that gives the car a wet
look that has to be seen to be believed.
