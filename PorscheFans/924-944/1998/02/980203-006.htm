Good Morning,

	First time post but I have been a subscriber for several months (great
group BTW, I just recently unsubscribed from the Corrado group after many
years). I have a new (to me) 88 944NA with 81K miles and a curious clutch
chatter. I hope I am using the right term, by chatter I mean a shaking or
vibration when the clutch is released. The odd thing is, that the chatter
goes away when the car is driven about 10-15 minutes or about 5-10 miles
and then the clutch feels smooth. I can park the car for several hours and
the chatter will not return, but always does overnight. Why would a clutch
quit chattering when it is warm? I assume the clutch is the original as I
do not have records from the first owner but have all records from the
second (I am the third). Mechanically the car is very sound, appears not to
have been abused or driven aggressively and checked out well on a pre-sale
inspection but they did not detect the chatter, probably because the car
was warm when it was inspected.  From what I read I don't think it is the
rubber center in the clutch but is it possible the rubber could swell when
warm and take up slack. The right motor mount was replaced after inspection
but not the other mounts, could it be the transmission mount? Thanks for
any input.
