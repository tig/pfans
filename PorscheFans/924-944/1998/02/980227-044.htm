So, I decided to remove the driver's seat in my 968 last night to take care
of a little problem with the wiring for the seatbelt warning light.  Along
with a small assortment of miscellaneous paper shrapnel, I garnered $1.52
in U.S. change left by the previous owner.  Also, there was a gold-colored
coin, about 1" diameter, with the following information on it, and I was
wondering if anyone on the list could tell me what, if any, value it might
represent:

	side 1	a "cross-like" design with some "people likenesses" inside
and having the denomination value of "10 Sk"

	side 2	a shield with a double "cross" inside and the words
"Slovenska Republika" with a mint date of 1993.

It would be easy for me to presume that it is from Slovenia, but other than
that, I am curious as to its worth (which, I am sure, won't be much).

TIA
