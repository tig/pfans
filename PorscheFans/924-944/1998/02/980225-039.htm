Hi David,

Please allow me to expand on gas welders in regard to collision repair of=
 vehicles.  My=20
concern is not of fire hazzard, although more than one car has been torch=
ed that way. =20
The true concern is in regard to improper welding that will not pass dest=
ructive tests=20
and thereby endangers the safety of the passengers and the integrity of t=
he vehicle=20
itself. =20

There is also a liability issue for repairing shops.  I-CAR gives an exam=
ple of an=20
Alabama shop that allegedly did improper welding of structural joints and=
 had their=20
welds come apart in a subsequent accident.  The passenger in this subsequ=
ent accident is=20
now brain damaged and requires 24-hour care as a result.  The body shop l=
ost a $1.2=20
million court settlement.

The only -- repeat -- only welding recommended by I-CAR for automotive co=
llision repair=20
for either sheet metal or structural is MIG welding.  The most recommende=
d shielding gas=20
for MIG welding steels in collision repair is 75% Argon/25% C02.  Modern =
vehicles use=20
galvanized steels and the heat of a gas torch would vaporize these coatin=
gs, allowing=20
rust to form which would allow cosmetic damage and possibly structural da=
mage later on.=20
Proper weld-through primer must be used prior to welding and rust prevent=
ion coatings=20
must be reapplied afterwards to restore the vehicle to pre-accident condi=
tion.  Heat=20
control is required to ensure proper strength of the final repair.  MIG c=
an do it=20
whereas gas torches cannot.  The gas torch also contaminates the weld its=
elf, reducing=20
its strength, while the shielding gas of the MIG prevents such contaminat=
ion.

Some vehicle makers use silicon bronze MIG wire for joints on exterior pa=
nel joints,=20
such as sail panels, where a cosmetic water-tight joint is needed.  This =
is still a MIG=20
repair.

The only time that a torch might be used on a vehicle in a manufacturing =
process that I=20
am aware of is if they use the torch to melt lead into a cosmetic joint. =
 Perhaps this=20
is what you have seen.  It is an obsolete technique and was usually reser=
ved for the=20
sail panel joint but perhaps someone is still using it.

Gas torches are dangerous around a body shop simply because some fool mig=
ht be tempted=20
to use one.  The only place they belong is near the frame machine for use=
 in stress=20
relieving with a rosebud tip.  They aren't even any good for cutting meta=
l as they=20
destroy the edges of the cut by changing the metalurgy.  Use a large sabr=
e saw or a=20
wheel saw made for the purpose or a plasma cutter instead.

If you do not know what HHS means (High Strength Steel) or which panels u=
se it then you=20
should not be welding on a vehicle.  Heat management is CRITICAL on HHS a=
nd it is found=20
in many panels all over the car.  Again, if you do not have proper traini=
ng and/or do=20
not have the proper equipment then you should not be welding on a vehicle=
..  Simply=20
hooking up wrong can blow every computer onboard.

All welds must be exactly as the factory did them in order to restore bot=
h proper=20
strength and proper crushability to the part.  Yes, it is quite possible =
to make an=20
improper repair by making your welds TOO strong and thereby destroying th=
e crushability.=20
This is serious business and should be left to those who know what they a=
re doing.


Sorry about getting carried away here, but safety and proper collision re=
pair are two of=20
my hot buttons.
