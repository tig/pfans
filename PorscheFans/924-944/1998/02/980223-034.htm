Everything is adjustable on the 951.  To get a very nice light feel to
the steering system, use the factory settings for front alignment.  
Essentially, the two key areas are caster and toe.  Set the caster to
2deg 30min, and set the toe to +5min each side for a total of 10min toe-in.
Jay Pasha, in many articles in Excellence recommends a higher toe and caster
setting to help eliminate the front end's steering sensitivity (wheel wobble)
I believe it was 3deg 0min caster and +10min toe each side for a total
of 20min toe-in (I know the caster is correct, but I may be off with the toe,
perhaps someone can quickly verify, Jay?)

So far, trying many different alignment, this is what I feel is the best
compromise for steet/track driving w/o sacrificing tire life:

            Camber         Caster          Toe          Total Toe
Front       -1deg          2deg 30min      +5min        +10min toe-in
Rear        -1deg 30min                    0min         0min

1deg = 60min so -1deg 30min = -1.5deg.  Is caster spelled castor or caster??

With the above alignment, the car drifts very nicely with the rear end 
being the first to go, gives nice turn in and a nice light feel to the 
steering.  When you start to push it, the steering becomes heavier,
basically relaying the info from the contact patch.

Age can be the culprit of a shock absorber too, not just mileage, but all
951(S) I've seen have an easy to push down rear end and a stiff front end.
The 951(S) also seems to squat quite a bit under acceleration, but then all
Porsches seem to do that.

Jason @ Paragon can probably help you figure out if they are worn.  The
only tell-tale signs I know of are oil on the housing, unusual noises,
or scratched piston rods.  The best way to test is to take it out, that
is the only way to check for wear (without any external signs).

Some pads transfer a lot of heat to the rotor.  The Metal Master, when 
driven hard through mountain passes (actually, it was my fault, I was
chickening out and standing on the binders) can warp the rotors.  In
comparison, a good street/track pad like the PF or Porterfield transfers
heat more effectively balancing between caliper and rotor.  Like I said,
I managed to warp my front rotors a while back, but luckily, it was not
permanent.  I was chasing Don Nimi's Toyota Supra TT through the mountain
passes near Whistler.

You can warp a rotor in 5 miles after installing them, so age or mileage
has nothing to do with it.

>What is the current pad consensus for hard street and light autocross?

Most people like the Metal Master or Performance Friction street pad.
Pads are a personal issue and are dependant on your climate, use and
determination (cleaning a race pad's muck is a nightmare).

>Any difference between shops that turn rotors, is there a higher accuracy
>method or are they all the same?

My recommendation, don't turn the rotor.  By taking mass off the rotor,
you are making it more likely to warp again.  If there is tons of material
left (no lip on the rotor edge), then perhaps it's worth the effort, but
if the rotor is even 25% worn, I would just replace it.  Be sure to use
factory style units as some of the aftermarket units have warped in friend's
951's much easier than the factory units.

>    Rear suspension on an 89, is the rear end supposed to be looser than an
>88? Perhaps the Koni's are set full soft? 

The Turbo S information guide I have has a specific setting for the rear
Koni's, something like 1/2 turn from full soft, I'll look it up tonight
or David J. will probably beat me too it.  Most 951's that have been tracked
usually have the rears turned up to full hard.

All chips produce similar power.  If you feel most comfortable with the
Weltmeister, go for it.  Remember that the WM chips require the wastegate
shim which is a PITB to install.  APE uses a boost bolt, Jim Conforti (sp?)
is now making chips (very well known in the BMW circles, all my BMW friends
swear by his chips), Milledge has chips that are supposed to be very fast,
and many other companies offer them.

If I had to do it again, I'd go Milledge or (if a return policy is
available) test out the Conforti chips.  I highly recommend you dyno your
car before and after the chip installation and make sure the car is running
at 100% before installing chips.  Chips are not designed to fix or cover
up problems, they are there to enhance a good, strong motor.  I'm sure your
89 is in tip-top condition.

Anyways, these are my opinions.
