Hi,

While looking through some of the Tech Bulletins at my local dealer today
I ran across one that was interesting since I may be experiencing the
concern raised.  Here's the info:

Models: 944 S2, model years 1989 and 1990.

Concern: Hydraulic noise (humming/droning) heard from the engine and/or
the external oil cooler area at around 1600 rpm can be caused by the oil
pressure relief valve.

Repair Information:  A new oil pressure relief valve with offset relief
bores can be installed.

Parts Information: New version valve: PN 944 107 035 02 (contains blue =
dot
on the hex head).

Vehicle Information:  The new version oil pressure relief valve is
installed in production from engine number: 42 L 05160

----------------------------------
Since I have engine number 42 L 02498 and my engine does make some kind =
of
weird noise at almost exactly 1600 rpm I wonder if this could be the
problem.  I have been thinking all along that is was a belt/roller noise,
but now I'm not so sure.

Anyone experience this and retrofit this new relief valve with success?

TIA,
