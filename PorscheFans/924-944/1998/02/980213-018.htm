I tend to use 951(S) so vendors know what parts I'm looking for, etc.  Just
as an interesting note, cars from 1990 onwards were not the same as the 89
and 88S versions.  You had to specify the M030 suspension, etc. to get it.
I've seen one 1990 that didn't have the sport suspension, but they do come
with the newer style S2 wing.  Keep in mind, these cars were brought into
Canada up till 1991.  Excellence never seems to mention this, I guess they
are only concerned with their US readers.  Apparently, they were so expensive
in 1990 and 91 that they had to option out a bunch of stuff to bring the
base price down to a decent level.  Anyone on the list in Canada own a 90
or 91 951?

For someone that wants the ultimate 951, they can come up to Canada and hunt
around for a 91 or 90 with M030.  A black 1990 951 sold up here not so long
ago for C$35,000 or US$24,000.  The car had VERY low km, something like
15,000km.  It was a sale from an associate to his friend, so I was not able
to get the info out before the sale.
