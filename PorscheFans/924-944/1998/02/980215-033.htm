Hi all,

I just changed the spark plugs in my S2 to the Bosch tri-electrode WR7DTC
which is standard on the 968.  The plugs I pulled (WR5DC) only had about
5K miles on them according to the PO's records, but I wanted to try (no
pun intended) the 968 variety.  Results?

A definite seat of the pants improvement :-)  Throttle response was so
much better than when I first attempted to pull out of the driveway the
rpm shot way up as I gave it the usual amount of throttle and slipped the
clutch.  The engine seems raring to go and part throttle torque feels
better and the engine is even smoother than before.  I'm very happy with
the results.  My wife will be driving the S2 tomorrow, as well as my son
Scott.  Hopefully they'll report the same impressions.

I also plan to install a set of these plugs in Scott's 951S.  I'm not =
sure
his 8 valve head will respond like the 16 valve, but it's worth a try.

Any others done this "mod" with similar results?
