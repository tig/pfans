     Sorry for the late post, I'm on Digest.
     
     I've always done the heel and toe with the right and left side of my 
     foot, rather than actually the "heel and toe."  I believe from reading 
     Vic Elford's book (Porsche Driving Handbook, which is highly 
     recommended if you're new to this thing) that this is also the method 
     he uses.  It should be noted that I have a large foot (shoe size 
     12-14, depending on the maker).  I'm new to my 944, and I don't know 
     what other drivers might say, but the 944 doesn't heel and toe as 
     readily as other cars I've driven/owned.  This is only in street 
     driving however, I have not driven the car on the track (yet!).  It 
     will probably take a while before I am comfortable.  
     
     Other guys on the list could probably provide more input, but I often 
     double-clutch on leisurely down shifts on the street where the speed 
     of the shift doesn't matter.  I remember a BMW club racer once saying 
     it was easier on the gearbox ( I assume putting less stress on the 
     synchros?)  I don't know if that's true or not, but with other cars 
     I've driven it does produce a much smoother shift than just using the 
     synchros (ie not double-clutching) and thus would seem to be easier on 
     the gearbox.
