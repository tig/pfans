Greetings,
I am looking at the different types of welders currently on the market =
and thought what a better place to ask questions than my friends here on =
this post. What I am looking for is a small welder for home use in my =
shop. Now, I call this a shop when in fact its really my garage. I want =
something that will work off of 110 volt household current. I find two =
that interest me but I am unsure of what the difference really is. Look =
at page 100 of the Sears tool catalog and you will find two styles that =
I am interested in purchasing.
1) Mig welder (item A)
2) Gasless wire feed welder (item B)
For general purpose welding ... ?
a) Mig welder will do more types of welding?
b) Gasless is just about the same as a Mig welder?
c) Which has more flexibility around the shop?
d) Which is easier to work with?
Any feed back is always welcomed. There are several manufactures of =
these types of welders, but Sears tools always seem to work well.=20
Thank you,
John
