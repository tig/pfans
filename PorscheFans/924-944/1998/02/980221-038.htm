Hi Folks . . .

Just wanted to share a sad tale of woe:   Got mine a year ago for $5000 with
only 47,000 on the clock.  Not much wear, just a lot of old stuff that gave
up the ghost after recent use.

Since then, I've replaced the Flex Plate Damper, water pump, all the hoses,
all the belts, a couple of rollers, the front pads, motor mounts, main seal,
front seals, redid the cvs, tranny, and filled up the differential . . .
After having my mech rename all of his children after me, and after funding
their ways through college, I am still frustrated . . . does anyone know a
good source (cheap, as I have no money left) for the little rectangular
plastic console covers . . . you know, the ones that cover the holes near
where the power door lock and mirror switches are?  Odd as it may seem,
after all of this work, this little discrepancy is driving me up the wall .
.. . *laugh*  Couldn't find 'em in Automotion or Performance . . . maybe I'm
not looking hard enough.

My wife, bless her caring soul . . . hasn't said a word about all the money
spent . . . I think she understands . . . she must, as she took it out
shopping today, and left me with the minivan!  Happy Motoring all . . .
