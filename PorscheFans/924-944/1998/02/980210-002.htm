Water droplets under the oil filler cap: I see this symptom from time to
time, and on my current 84 I see it more than on the old, forever gone
85.5 944 I had.

I also feared the infamous oil cooler seal leakage/failure (PO records
indicate it was resealed four years ago). I have no oil in the coolant
tank, and the dipstick is clean oil. And, my dipstick ain't rusting
(must be that fresh oil). Well...I also see ripe territory here for
analogy, too...

Condensation in the motor? Does anybody else in wet, above-freezing
climates see this condition?

For me, it *is* winter here in N. CA, and you can say we've had some
rain in the last few weeks. And, I found out a week ago tonight in an
especially memorable storm that a 944 will traverse a few inches' deep
mudslide mixed with rockes and branches:
