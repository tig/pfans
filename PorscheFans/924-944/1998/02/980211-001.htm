Hi P-fans,

I want ask, just how much is a complete set of shop manual; and do you
think the price is overinflated?  

A CD-ROM version would be nice, as per the idea of printing out the pages
you need to get them dirty if need be, and also for efficient search of
subjects.  

One person pointed out that if a Manual is duplicated in the form of CD,
and not sold for profit, the PCNA may not care about it.  Well, for every
CD made, though not-for-profit, is a lost of potential manual sell by PCNA.
 On those grounds they can still get on your case and sue you.  

One of the reasons PCNA have delayed their CD version of shop manual may be
because CDs are easy to copy.  There is no such thing as a unaggressive 7
or 8 copies... CDs can be duplicted for $3 or less.  

A little FYI from the internet piracy medium termed WAREZ.  The most
popular pirate software are overpriced games and Microsoft programs.
Remember, to make a CD is $3 retail, $1 or less commercially.  You have 2CD
MS-Office for $450 .  No wonder people are upset enough to defy federal law
and distribute them freely on the web.  

My personal opinion is that most of us on the list appear to love Porsche,
and perhaps PCNA too.  It's not hard for one person to fight overpricing of
software, and perhaps make a profit at it, if the determination behind the
act is fueled by anger of overpricing.  If the item is resonably
affordable, the amount of work involved in duplication process and the risk
of federal prosecution will deter such an act.  

I of course cannot afford an expensive $300 CD-writing equipment, $100
scanner, $Free unregistered WAREZ web site (sponsored by WAREZ affiliates
utilizing U.S. military web design of untracable, unblockable server
location), and hundreds of demand for affordable Porsche shop manuals, or
the knowledge of shop maunal cost; which is a premise of spiteful
determination for quality self-help.  

NOTE: I do not participate in illegal software transfer.  I voluntarily go
the the store, conciously and competently allow myself to be overcharged
for an item in the great spirit of suppy-demand and monopoly.  

Nuff said,
