Yeah, it was this very same thread that not too long ago I mentioned to
someone in this list that I bought the Autopal H4 7" halogen Eurospec
headlamps fm AutoAtlanta. The pair ran me exactly $20 US and this
includes the H4 55/60W bulbs and the two smaller pilot lamps that act as
parking lamps when the headlight bulbs are turned off. They give a
pretty cool white glow when just the parking lights are turned on. When
I turn on my headlights, the headlight pods rise up. Then when I
extinguish the headlights and leave the parking lights on, the headlight
pods stay up and I can show off my cool parking lights within the
headlight reflector bowl! If it wasn't for this feature, I would have
went ahead and bought the Bosch H4 7" conversions. I hope you like the
Hellas. I had Hella 7" H4s on my 80 MGB Anniversary Edition.......until
some other guy forced me to introduce my MG to the center wall on I-95
southbound! The Hellas were wonderful! Pity though.....I had just tuned
and synchronized those Weber 45DCOE9 side draft carbs. The blasted car
was simply too light for the power.....couldn't keep traction well onto
the pavement. Oh well.....may she rest it pieces! :-(
