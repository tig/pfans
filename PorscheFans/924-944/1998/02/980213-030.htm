As I mentioned I just purchased my 88 turbo S on the 10th of this month
in Oklahoma.  It was a 2 owner with 74,000 miles all original down to
the radio except for the seats, the factory cloth had worn, and the
dealer, not knowing any better recovered ALL the seats with burgandy
cloth (matches the carpet).  But aside from that it is pretty close to
perfect.  I would rate the car a 9.  All dealer serviced and book
stamped.  I paid $11,800 for the car.  They were asking $13,900.  And
they had no idea that it was an S.  The Kelly Blue Book Value
(www.kbb.com) said $12,095 retail.

there is a 89 grey turbo right down the street from me for sale with
45,000 miles on it, it appears to truly be perfect ( I would rate it a
10 even with the miles ) and it's for sale at $21,000.

I hope this helps you with current prices.  I personally think I came
out of my deal on top considering it was at a dealer.

Good Luck,
Gary
