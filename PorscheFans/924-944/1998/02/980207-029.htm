I hesitate to keep the non-Porsche stuff going but realize there are a lot
of people out there who have to wade through emails like this one looking
for the good stuff.  I wanted to post a followup to some emails regarding
Eudora and filtering.  I use Eudora Pro v4.0 under Win95 and I don't know
how it may differ from the free version.  For me, setting up a filter is as
easy as right clicking on an email and selecting Make Filter.  That's it,
from then on email from that user goes into it's own folder.  Or, by
clicking on a radio button, you can change to filter based on recipient or
words in the subject.  And the folder it goes into can be the trash folder.
 No manual required, no click on tools, click on filters, etc.  Just a thought.
