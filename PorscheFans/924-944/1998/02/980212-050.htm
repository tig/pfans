Mark Leeber <mleeber@mindspring.com> asks:
> What do you mean by relay kit?

He is running seperate, thicker, wires to the battery and
switching them using a new relay in order to handle the extra
currrent requirements of the higher wattage bulbs he is using.
However he is making the point that this may be useful even
with the 55/60 watt bulbs.

David: Was your 10 volt measurement an 'open circuit' voltage?
On the low beams?  Or on the high beams?  Is it possible you
have some corrosion problems from the salty air in Hawaii?

Automotion sells both 'DOT-legal' Hella and 'off road European
spec' Zelmot H4 lights.  I ended up purchasing a set of European
spec Hellas from someone on the net.  These Hellas are quite
similar to the Zelmots that Automotion sells and are great.
The Autopal lights that were mentioned in a different posting
also sound kind of neat.

The European spec lights seem to be the way to go if you don't
mind the 'off road use only' disclaimer.  I used European Hella
H4s twenty years ago in my '78 Buick Turbo Regal - which had come
with tungsten lights.  Never was hassled once - and I lived in
Arizona and Nevada which had periodic vehicle inspections.  Since
almost all U.S. cars from about 1980 on have halogens, albeit DOT
crippled, I suspect that the odds of being hassled are between
slim and none.

I predict that you will be very happy with any of the above new
lights - even without fussing with new wiring and relays.
