Dear Fans:
        I have not used my A/C for a couple months (a no-no according to
the Manual) because of a broken switch on the climate control panel. Last
week, I put in another unit. Using the A/C today, the temperature gauge
gradually rose from the lower white mark, which is where it is anchored
most of the time, nearly to the higher white hashmark.   At the time I was
travelling in moderate traffic at about 45 mph and the temp. was showing no
signs of going down--maybe rising a bit, so I turned off the A/C system.
The temperature gauge returned to normal in a couple minutes.
        Reading the FAQ, I wonder if the 2nd A/C fan is not turning on, or
if the relays are really screwed up and the fans are shutting down when I
turn on the A/C. I'll go out to my car and turn on the A/C while the beast
is still warm and see if the fans go on. Any other ideas would be
appreciated.

Regards,
Khal Spencer
