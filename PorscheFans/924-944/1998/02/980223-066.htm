<snip>....Most of the time you have to cut the metal before you weld it.
Your hacksaw is not the trick tool for cutting anything you want to weld. 
If
you are buying a welder, you will need an oxy/acetylene cutting torch and
gas welder.  You can weld thin metals with the gas torch. You can learn to
use the cutting torch in a short period of time but the gas welding
requires a good deal of practice....<snip>

I agree with the first whole half of jims comment, but I dont agree with is
welding thin metals with a gas torch. yes it can be done, but the biggest
problem with the gas torch is heat, too much of it. For body work the heat
will distort the the metal a lot if it is not tacked right. Tacking is a
art of its own, and can make big difference in how the finished product
will look. The ultimate choice would be a tig welder, but that would be big
bucks. 

The mig welder is a little more expensive because you have to buy a
regulator, and rent or buy a argon tank for it.  But in my personal opinion
I would choose the mig welder over the gasless because it can turn out
cleaner welds.
