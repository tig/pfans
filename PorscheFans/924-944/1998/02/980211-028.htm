Dear John,

I own an 88 944S and have the same problem. The level gets down just a hair
past half way on the dipstick and my oil level light comes on. I panicked at
first, so I went to Squires Autowerk here in Seattle (one of the most
trusted Porsche garages in the state of WA) and Squire said no worries.
Apparently the sensors are designed to go on "somewhere between half and the
bottom of the dipstick range". He said 944's, with fresh rings (less than
40000 miles!!) or fully broken in will use oil. Sometimes quite a bit.
(Porsche says that depending on driving habits, 944's can use up to 1.5
liters of oil per 1000km!!) And likewise they rely on the cooling properties
of oil far more than other cars on the road.

Also he said, that if he had a 16 valve 944 (S1 or S2 specifically), a full
crackcase of high quality oil would be his first priority. This is due to
the price of a new head and/or cams from running hard with a lack of oil. 

From then on, I keep a full qt. behind my seat. I also noticed that there is
the sticker by the gas filler cap that says to check the oil every fill up.
It is no wonder, huh? Basically the light should be interpreted as an
indicator of when to put in oil, not a warning of a problem. I can sleep
easier now.

Hope this helps and makes you feel better like it did me!
