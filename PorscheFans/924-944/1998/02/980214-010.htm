Hi All;

It's been a long while since I have been on the list.  It's good to be
back!

Now I have a problem with my 1989 944 Turbo.  This morning the battery
was dead when I tried to start it up.  After getting it started and
returning from a short drive, I noticed the Turbo waterpump continued to
run longer than 30 seconds.  I stopped it by removing the fuse.  When I
reinstalled the fuse the pump did not start running again.  I think this
is what caused the battery to run down in the first place.

Any ideas how to fix this?  The car had been sitting since last Sunday. 
The only stupid thing I have done lately is clean the engine with a
pressure washer.  I tried to be careful about where I sprayed, but I may
have gotten something wet that is now shorting out causing the pump to
continue running.

Please reply directly to wtmeyer@erols.com.  Thanks in advance.

Tracy Meyer
