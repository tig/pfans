I have an extra grey Technalon Evolution 3 (or 4, not sure) car cover that
I do not need. The code on it is B-34 and it has the Performance Products
logo on the front (the hood area).  I called Covercraft, the maker of the
car cover who says this cover fits all 944 models.  It does not fit
my 951 well, but I would expect it to fit the 944 decently given it was
made for it and possibly the 924 even better (since it is narrower). 

If you are interested let me know.  My storage space is limited, I would
rather sell it cheap than keep it so if you want to pick up a cover
without spending much this could be your chance.
