Greetings to the list:

	My name is Bill, and I live in northern NJ. I don't as yet have a 944,
but I'm looking. Thanks to the posts of the experts, and others, you
have saved me many thousands of dollars. Last fall, I saw an ad for a
1986 944. No color or millage listed, $3500. Had I seen this ad before I
subscribed to the list, I would have bought it. Then, how much would it
have cost to put it right?

	On the subject of maintainence costs, my daily driver is a 1990 Ford
van, Diesel. Oil and filter change and chassis lube is $60. Exhaust
system $400. Brakes $650. I don't mind spending the money, as long as I
have reliability. My wife's car is a 1988 Mazda 626. Here again, oil and
filter change is $25. 120M mile service was $650. Exhaust system $350.
Brakes $350. Based on what I'm paying for service now compared to costs
for similar work on a Porsche, some service costs on a Porsche seem
reasonable.

	I found a Testors model of a 944S at a model train show in Springfield,
Mass. Turns out the guy who had this particular display also had an
interest in owning a 944. When he found out what they cost to maintain,
he stopped looking. He now collects models of Porsches.

	I don't know how many people on the list have had, or are having the
problem of convincing their SO that they need and/or desperatly want a
944, but I did. I have a solution. It worked for me. Maybe the subject
of another post.

	Regards, Bill
