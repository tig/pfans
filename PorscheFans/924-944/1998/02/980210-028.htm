Since there has been some interest in my repair of odometers, I have
compiled instructions for doing so.  This repair is for units with a
functioning speedometer and a broken odometer.  If you speedometer doesn't
work, you have additional problems not covered here. These instructions are
for early 944 and all 924,  although the actual repair of the odometer
itself is the same for later 944 and possibly 968.  I have successfully
repaired the odometer on my '84 and '85 and so can you.  The problem is the
misalignment of one small gear when the odometer is reset while moving.
Other list members have found a broken gear and glued it together, but that
was not the case with me.

Tools needed:
24 mm socket with 5 inch extension.
one common screwdriver.
one small thin blade common screwdriver or an awl for prying the
speedometer bezel.
one small to medium phillips head screwdriver.
one very small to small phillips head screwdriver.
extra gauge bulbs in both sizes, or an entire set

Time:
One to one and a half hours.

INSTRUMENT CLUSTER REMOVAL:

DISCONNECT THE BATTERY.
1. Carefully remove the horn pad by lifting it evenly and disconnect the wire.
2. Using a 24 mm socket remove the steering wheel retaining nut and then
the washer.
3. Make the relationship between the steering shaft and the steering wheel
so that you may return the wheel to its original position.
4. Remove the steering wheel.
5. Remove the two phillips head screws inside the left and right openings
for the instruments.  (top of the opening, halfway back)
6. Remove the two phillips head screws holding the upper and lower plastic
cover for the steering column.  (access from the bottom with a thin
screwdriver)
7.Remove the upper and lower covers.  This may take a little wiggling, but
they will come free.  They will break if not careful.
8. Detach one of the wiring connectors of the turn signal assembly at lower
right of steering column.  (If it were a clock face it would be the 4 - 5
o'clock position.  You can detach all of the connectors to fully remove the
assembly)
9. Remove the three slotted screws on the face of the turn signal assembly.
10. Pull the assembly off of the steering shaft and set aside or let dangle
free depending on if you removed one connector or all of them.
11.  The instrument cluster is now ready for removal.  Pull it out of the
dash until you feel resistance from the speedometer cable.  Then rotate the
cluster so that the right side of the cluster is closer to you than the
left side.  With your right hand reach behind the cluster an unscrew the
connection for the speedometer cable.
12. Once the cable is disconnected the cluster will come out with all the
wires attached to the back of the instruments.  Diagram the connections and
disconnect  them all.   Remove cluster from dash.
13.  Installation is the reverse.

ODOMETER REPAIR

1. Slide the speedometer out of the front of the instrument cluster.
2. VERY CAREFULLY remove the bezel by prying up on the lip of the bezel (on
the back side) along the entire circumference, and then pulling it off.
Then remove the clear plastic lens.  Keep your fingers off the dial (face)
of the speedometer and indicator needle.
3. Unscrew the two screws holding the metal chassis on the back side and
slide the metal chassis from the speedometer.
4. The nonaligned gear is on the left of the unit (looking at the back)
even with the top row odometer numbers.  The gear is red and is driven (or
is suppose to be) by a white worm gear below it, which in turn is driven by
the large white gear.  The red gear need only to be repositioned outward so
the worm gear below can engage it.  THAT'S THE REPAIR!
5. Use a drill with a phillips head bit in the hole for the cable to drive
the unit and test for correct operation.
6. Clean the clear plastic with plain water and dry with a nonabrasive
towel.  Don't get fingerprints on it.
7. Assemble the speedometer and carefully push the edge of the bezel down
so that it stays on.
8. Install the speedometer in the cluster using the alignment tab on the
bottom as a guide.

ADDITIONAL:

If your arm and hand are large, you may have difficulty removing and
especially installing the speedometer cable.  Arrange an assistant for this
step.  It is not otherwise difficult.
You can remove and clean the bulbs or replace them all.  Dust settles on
them and burns making the bulb a little dark.  Illumination is slightly
increased after cleaning.

BEFORE attaching the speedo cable, connect the battery and check the gauge
lights.  Replace as needed.  Twice I had bulbs blow.  Maybe age and
movement cause it.  Disconnect the battery and finish installation.

Don't do the job without extra bulbs unless:
you feel very lucky
want to test your night vision
want to tear the dash apart a second time to install new bulbs
want your car tied up while you wait for ordered bulbs to arrive.

The battery should always be disconnected when working on the vehicle's
electrical system.

Time is unkind to plastic - be careful

Overall the job is not difficult and is within the skills of an adventurous
novice and above.

If anyone finds fault or error in my procedure (I write this from memory)
please let us all know.

DISCLAIMER:  Although I have written these instructions from actual
experience and believe them to be accurate, I will bear no responsibility
for you damaging your vehicle.  If you are in doubt at all about your
skills, any speedometer shop will gladly take your money and hopefully
offer some recourse if something goes wrong.

Good Luck,
