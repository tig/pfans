Well, I finally got the head off.  It was almost as big a job as the
K-27, mainly because of the stripped allen bolt.  It would have been a
big job still without the bolt problems.  I can't see any evidence of
the Gasket being blown.  I called my friendly Porche mechanic(I'm going
to let him do my clutch) and he said if I didn't drive the car very far
with the gasket blown that many times you can't tell by looking at the
gasket.  I only drove my car about a half mile after it blew to my
house.

The piston tops had a little carbon deposits but the cylinder walls look
smooth and clean.  Everything looked fine as far as I could tell on the
old head.  I now have to remove the exaust manifold and put it on the
new PowerHaus modified head, clean the engine surface up a little and
I'll be ready to mount the new head.  I should be getting my new timing
belts and manifold in this week. I hope the belts are easier than the
head and turbo.  If anyone has any suggestions or helpful hints(other
than taking it to a real mechanic) feel free to jump in.  Thanks,

Randall Morton
