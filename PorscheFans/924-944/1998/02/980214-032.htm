I don't use my 944 to attract women--my wife hates it when I date!  I will
say, however, that here in the Pacific Northwest, we have numerous women P-
fans, of which my wife is one.  She and I have autocrossed both a 911and a 944
for the past several years.  I think it has made us both way better drivers,
and on at least one occasion she thinks her auto-x experience saved her from a
serious freeway accident when her Honda began aquaplaning.  She also attends
DE days, but hasn't yet been convinced to drive.  I run at SIR, and it's
pretty scary there if you screw up.  We are planning to attend a Jim Russell
school together this summer, though, so maybe she'll get over her timidity.  

Bottom line:  if you want your significant other to get intersted in the P-
car, buy her a helmet, point the car at some cones, and tell her there's
absolutely no way to hurt the car.  It worked for me--now she's as hooked as I
am.

By the way  Farzaan:  I'm very sorry to hear of your bad experience getting
your car repaired.  Best of luck in your dealings with the shop--give 'em
hell!
