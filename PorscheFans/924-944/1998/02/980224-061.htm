I just bought a Mig welder so here's some of the info I learned.

	The MIG Welder on Page 100 doesn't have enough power. You should get
something that will go up to at least 1/4 inch. I bought the 120-volt MIG
Welder on page 101 (G). I didn't get it from Sears though I got it from Price
Club (Costco) for $100 less ($399.00). The welder on page 100 costs $299.00
but you have to add $60 for shipping charges. So you might as well spend the
extra and get the (G) welder from Price Club.  I have a cousin who has a
120-volt welder (Millermatic) and he uses it semiprofessionally. He says that
having a 120-volt welder is great because you can use it anywhere. He's had
welding buddies try to swap even with him for 220-volt welders and won't do
it. 

As far as metal thickness goes, I think 1/4" is pretty thick. A welder that
will do up to 1/4" is definitely enough for around the home/farm type stuff. 

I was also told to stay away from the low end Lincoln electric welders (Home
Depot Style) because they're poorly constructed.

Anyway, I love my welder and they are really easy to use. There's a Haynes
Welding manual that has a lot of information also.
