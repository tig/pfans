      litre 8v motor?

Mr Wulff, please be sure to post any findings onto the listing. I'm
curious like hell to find out if there is any miracle "add-on" or
"bolt-on" item that would add more muscle to our beloved powerplants.
Then again, I believe I read on the 944 faq that ".....if the guys at
Zuffenshausen (sp?) could have squeezed out more hp in this standard
form without sacrificing efficiency and reliability, they would have
done so." And you know what? I think that statement could very well hold
true. Remember, the na 8v 2.5L engine was in it's most primitive and
non-modified form. Hence the evolution of the 2.7L, 3.0L, 16 valving,
and of course the addition of the turbo and later, intercooling. I guess
the Porsche company did this to have a variety of models to choose from
and they also like to create powerplants with "room to grow", just like
the air-cooled siblings in the 911 genre. Look at them, they've modified
and modified until they can't absolutely do no more! So much, that
they've now turned to water-cooling! Again, the process of evolution.

Sorry for rambling on like this. Hope I was at least entertaining!
