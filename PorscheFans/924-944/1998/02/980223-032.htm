Hi guys, well I had my first long mountain road drive in my new 89 951.
Much different feel than my 88. Its much flatter cornering but seems a
little more jerky and bouncy. Also, the power steering assist is a lot
higher. I actually like the 88 steering feel better, less assist, more
feedback. I'm wondering if its adjustable?
    I noticed the rear is easy to push up and down while the front is very
stiff. Is this normal, or are my rear shocks set to soft? I cant beleive
they are worn out yet(21000 miles). 
    The only imperfection I found is the front rotors seem to be warped. I
get a pulsing vibration through the pedal at higher speeds and light pedal
application. I'm suprised at this low mileage that they could be warped.
Anyone else have similar probs with the S4 brakes? The pads are almost to
the sensors, so maybe the PO was brake happy. 
   Anyway, heres my questions for the day.
How long between pad changes and rotor resurfacing is average?
What is the current pad consensus for hard street and light autocross?
Any difference between shops that turn rotors, is there a higher accuracy
method or are they all the same?
    Rear suspension on an 89, is the rear end supposed to be looser than an
88? Perhaps the Koni's are set full soft? 
    Any advice on chips? I'm leaning towards Weltmeister, but maybe thats
cause I have a couple of freinds who work there and I like the way they
explain their approach to chips. But I'd like some experienced opinions
please. 
Thats it for now, thanx.
