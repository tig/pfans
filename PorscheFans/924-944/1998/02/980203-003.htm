Zdeslav I suspect that the local authorities in your area are not
concerned with the emissions from your cars exhaust. This is good if you
want to develop more power. The easiest thing to do if you are not
interested in opening up your motor would be a pair of Weber carburetors
and a set of custom extractors/headers ( call them what you like ) to
hook up to your new exhaust. This should provide a good jump in power
without you having to spend too much money or sacrificing much
reliability.

My car is 1983 production year, Euromodel with  125 hp ( little bit
higher since I've  put the K&N filter, SplitFire spark plugs and REMUS
performance exaust on it)
Does anyone knows for any other performance upgrades for 924's ?  I
don't want to open my motor in order to do any of the upgrades tricks
since I don't know how this is going to affect the durability of my
motor.
