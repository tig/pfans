Hi Tracy & P-fans,
	I am glad your electric H20 pump problem is fixed. Or fixed fro the time
being? You might just want to take a smal screw driver and pry off the relay's
black plastic cover. Inspect the relay for water and also for any "cold
solder" joints. The solder might look slightly distorted.

	The parts diagram was from the "924/944/928 parts and technical reference
guide: models '77-'88", Porsche part#PNA-000-147-A. It cost about $10 and is
money well spent!

	The 951 engine diagram is from a Porsche book called: "1985  944 Turbo
Information Technik Book", Porsche part#WKD-491-321. I am not sure if it still
available from Porsche. Check with your dealer or "MY-Porsche".  I have found
the Porsche service intro books have plenty of great information. Note there
is also a simular book with the same title but for the 1986 model year. It has
a little less info than the '85 M.Y. book.
	There is also a book called: "1985  944 Turbo DME/KLR Test Plan info technik
book". Porsche part#WKD-453-920.  Again, I am not sure if it still available.
Check with a dealer. This book show a step by step diagnostic procedure of the
two black boxes. It contain a wealth of info.
	There is also a book on the 944 Turbo-S model. Porsche Part #WKD-495-021. It
covers the differences between the "S" and "non-S" models. Also a handy
reference guide. 

As always.... Good Luck
