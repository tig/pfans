The S box has hardened 1st and 2nd gears, a LSD and oil cooler. The
Quaife diff is a torsen type which transfers drive from the wheel to the
other as it looses traction where as a normal LSD just locks. Most
manufacturers use torsen type diffs now and they seem to be the way to
go. Although you could by a whole S box for the price of a new Quaife
diff.

What is the difference between a 951 and 951 S box?  As I am one of
those
people without LSD, I was planning to go the Quaife route, but if I
could
do equally (if not better) with the S box it might be a better (and less
expensive) option....
