Ed,
I seem to recall a thread indicating that the supplemental fuse panel on some
of these cars is subject to overheating due to some slightly undersized metal
or something, anyway, since this strip controls power to headlights, fans,
a/c, power windows, and fuel pump (not sure which one) I suspect that is your
culprit. I had an old saab that had this same kind of problem, and the heat
was caused by slight corrosion in some pressed together fittings. I could feel
that it was running too hot, tried cleaning and tightening all the
connections, which did nothing. Replaced it at last and it ran cool as a
cucumber. I kept thinking the heat was due to a circuit drawing too much
current, but it was not so. As mine heated up and cooled down different things
would go intermittent, as the heat caused expansion resulting in contacts not
doing their thing. If anything looks the least bit melty or feels hot, I would
just replace the strip. I don't think they are that expensive, though
switching out the wires could be a hassle. Also check your grounds. They are:
-On the frame near each headlight (brown wires connected)
-Battery to frame in battery box (big wire)
-battery to engine behind and under heater valve (hard to find - 2 wires come
out of harness and connect in this area - I don't think they are serving these
circuits though)
-in driver foot well - go to far front left corner of foot well and look up,
at top is a little cluster with brown wires connected.
Oh, and if you go to change the fuse strip, I believe there is some kind of
tool available to make it easier to get the wire-end connectors out of the
strip without destroying them. It might be possible to use the right micro-
screwdriver too.  I am not sure if you are referring to the haynes manual on
the 944 or 924. For the 924S, the early 944 diagram seems to be correct (the
factory 944 manual set includes the 924S diagrams, and they are drawn
differently but seem to be the same wiring. By the way, the factory 944
manuals, in one form or another are a most worthwhile investment if you are
going to do much work yourself(selves) on this car. Good Luck
