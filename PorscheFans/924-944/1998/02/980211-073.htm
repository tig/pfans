	>"What do you mean by relay kit?" 

	 Most places that sell high wattage headlight bulbs, also sell pre-made
wiring relay kits. The kits are under $40.  Simply plug your cars headlight
wiring harness into the "kit and route the relay "kits" wires to the battery.
Whala...more juice available at you newly installed flame throwers! 
	Two places that I know sell (as seen in the back of AutoWeek) these pre-made
relay kits are: 
Jazz Concepts, at 1-800-414-BULB
Competition Limited, 1-800-770-5553
www.htnews.com/comptitd

	I have only used/bought bulbs from Compitition. I think that IMPARTS also
sells H.P. relay kits.  ? 

-Good Luck
