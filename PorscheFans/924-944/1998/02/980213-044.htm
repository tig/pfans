The 574 stuff is a little hard to find locally.  You can get it from 
Automotion or EBS.  I buy it from Wurth, their brand not Loctite. 
 Wurth also carries the green stuff used for tighter fits, such as 
transmission side covers.

A PCA friend who works for Loctite recently recommended a different 
product as superior to 574: their 518 sealant.  Oddly enough, the 518 
is available at local auto parts places, and is not terribly expensive. 
 I haven't tried it yet, but I know a friend's shop has been using it 
and they're happy with the stuff.

Regarding assembly lube, use it if you've got it, else use engine oil. 
 All you're doing is ensuring lubrication until the oil pressure comes 
up, no big deal so long as something is there doing the job.  I 
wouldn't be too concerned about caking - the engine oil will move and 
dilute any assembly lube quite effectively. Remember it's a detergent 
and is very good at mixing with and suspending particulates, etc.
