Indexing the torsion bars sounds really complicated.
So i have some more questions:
1.what ride height difference range can be adjusted with the
  eccentric bolt on the trailing arm?

Roughly 3/4".

2.What's the effective height difference if the torsion bar
  is indexed one teeth more? (Or by how many degrees will the
  trailing arm be rotated?)

Not exactly sure.  Last did I did the job, I took measurements from the 
top of the spring plate to the "fin" that sweeps up from the torsion 
bar carrier and bolts to the chassis.  Which is probably pretty close 
to the ride height difference.  If you move the outer end (mounting 
flange) one spline, without moving the inner end, the difference was 30 
mm.  If you moved both, the difference was 4 mm.  It may be as much as 
50% more than that in ride height, depending on the distance between 
the axle centreline and the end of the springplate at which I measure 
things.

Bottom line is that the vernier effect gives you somewhere from 4 to 6  
 mm in static ride height sensitivity..

3.Do the bolts for camber and toe adjustment have a markable
  influence on the ride height? Shall we bring these also to
  a center position before adjusting the ride heihgt?

No, they don't.

>P.S.  Don't forget to take driver's weight into consideration.  Set 
the
>car up for an even ride height with your weight in the driver's seat.

What about the fuel tank? I think a half full one would be the best.

Yes, of course this is true if you're starting from scratch with a car 
that's out of kilter.  Good point.  When you go through the process, 
you have to start with a total change you want in fin-to-spring plate 
angle, based on unevenness in current set-up, plus desired change in 
static ride height, plus change due to different torsion bars.  On the 
last count, if you put in larger bars, the static ride height will go 
up because they compress less.

Once you're doing the measuring and fiddling, the rear suspension is 
totally unweighted.
