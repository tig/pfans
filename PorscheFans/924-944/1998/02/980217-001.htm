Hi,

Just wanted to give an update on what the shop said after I complained to
them.  In a situation like this, a shop can easily start to point fingers
and lay blame elsewhere, ie, they scratched your hood, but we'll take care
of it because you are our customer.  Well, my shop says it is not acceptable
for them to have let a car leave their shop in the condition I described
and they will take full responsibility to return it to its previous level.
No finger pointing, no blame laid.  "If it comes through my shop, it's my
responsibility to ensure the work was done right" is what he said exactly.

In addition to that, they have offered to send a 993 to my workplace, leave
the 993 there, take my 944T and rectify all the problems.  Once I am fully
satisfied, they will then take the 993 back (if they can pry my fingers off
the keys!)

Now, here is where I drop my head in a bit of shame.  Even though I was
very unhappy with what had happened before, I felt a bit ashamed that I 
had caused such a stir.  Over the last two years, I've become good friends
with my service manager and to have him apologize felt a bit unusual.
Once this whole thing is over and things work out ok, I'll buy a pair of
hockey or basketball tickets or something and give 'em to him along with a
"happy happy" letter to him cc'ed to his boss.

It was quite difficult writing the above paragraph, but I felt it needed to
be said.

Farzaan.
