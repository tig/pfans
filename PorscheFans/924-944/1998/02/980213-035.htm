Dear List Denizens:
        Would users of RE-71's mind indicating to me how many miles they
are getting out of a set of Bridgestone RE-71's? The guy at the tire store
indicated to me they might last "about a year or two". When I pressed him
for milage, he guessed 10-15 K miles if one drives them conservatively
(conservatively?? why buy a 944??).  By contrast, Lee ( lee@pmsales.com)
said he was still driving his at 30k.  That kinda milage would be more than
adequate for my miserliness.
        I would have them on an '89 951; 245's in back and 225's in front.
My driving habits are to be bored and slow when the road is straight and to
wake up and play when it gets twisty.  My other tire considerations are all
in the UTQG range of 200. I realize that like anything else, "your milage
may vary".

Thanks, and Happy Valentine's Day,

Khal Spencer
Honolulu
