I have two views on this.

One is the single men, 944 "getting-Women-to-look-at-you" inquiry.

    On this subject, I think that most women feel that a 944 is not a true
    Porsche (like a BMW 318ti in relation to BMers).  They probably think that
    you are "trying" to be a Porsche guy, but you really don't have the money
    to own a "true" Porsche.  For some reason, probably through ignorance,
    they feel that camaro guys are more true to form...and really know cars
    (or something like that...it almost sounds ridiculous...but you get my
    point).  Anyway,I think that a true "women-appealing" Porsche is the 911
    ....Boxster..or 968. Especially the 968 because many non-Porsche women are
    unfamiliar with it, and wonder "wow..what is that??". It also has an
    incredibly sexy shape.  Rob...back me up on this??

Second View is on the whole...getting your woman to love the Porsche as much
as you do issue.

    Probably impossible, unless it is their blood?? (like Roxy...).  I have
    been looking for my first Porsche for the past 8 months..trying to find
    the right one. My girl has gone from being really supportive, to outright
    angry,..and we are back to the supportive stage.  Although I try to
    explain everything to her, I don't think that she really "gets" it. OF
    course, I don't think that she is going to mind riding in it all summer!!

    For them to really understand it all,..the feeling, the rush, the quality
    that is built into these cars, I think that they have to WANT to
    understand it...

    NOTE:  A no point during the girlfriend's emotional swings did I ever
    change my mind in respect to getting the Porsche..!!

>Porsches that is.  Well, and the women too.  I see more 911's than Camaros
>every day.  Back when I lived in Michigan and was looking to buy a 951, my

>it's mroe like "Oh, you own one too?" or "Why don't you put lots of VTEC
