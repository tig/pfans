Surya and Fellow P-fans,
I was also looking for a replacement fog light lens for my turbo after a rock
kissed it.I ordered my replacement lens from http://www.oklahomaforeign.com
and after reading Surya's letter about just getting the glass lens, I was
concerned that was what I was going to get.Well, the new replacement lens
showed up this morning and to my relief it came as an assembly, complete with
new screws and gskt. The price was $110.00. Surya, what was the price that
AutoAtlanta charged you for the lens?
Another P-Fans was asking about how to remove the wire connectors from the
mirror plug. The way I removed them was to take needle nose pliers and try to
grab the connector from behind and give it a yank. All of them came out
sucessfully but one I had to solder back together.Be sure to spread the barbs
back out before you stick them back in the plug or they won't hold.
