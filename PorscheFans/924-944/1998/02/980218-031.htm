Mark;
I've thought alot about your post and the feelings of discovering that   
your car isn't what you hoped for.  I bought my 86 951 only 2 months ago.   
 Like you, I love my car and the way it runs.  Unfortunately, I looked at   
a lot of really bad 944's while searching for one to buy and I see a lot   
of bad ones on the road.  This makes me really appreciate the good ones!   
 I can appreciate the work that current owners put into their cars to   
keep them in top condition.  What's more, I can respect them for wanting   
to maintain a great car!

I bought my car knowing that it had seen a fair amount of neglect from   
the PO's and had even been in some 'minor' wrecks.  The important thing   
though is that I'm putting my time and effort into this car to make it   
the best possible.  This car was spiraling down when I got it, but not   
anymore!  I feel great satisfaction knowing that I've reversed that trend   
and I am resurrecting a great car!  It would be nice to buy a perfect   
car, but if that's not possible then I sure enjoy trying to get it back   
to where it belongs.
