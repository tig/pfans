Ok guys, I couldn't pass this up, as I  just eliminated my 911 to
purchase a water cooled Porsche ( started out for a 928, but found a
great deal on this 88 951 S).  I owned my 81 911SC since 93 to this
month, so I have been through it all with the car.  I went to my repair
shop last night and told the owner I would never go back to a 911.

In my assessment the 944 Turbo has obviously much more power than my
stock 178 hp 911SC had, but there is so much more.  The 951S handles
hands down better, has a more comfortable ride, is all around smoother.
Plus the shifting! I had just had a trans/clutch job in the 911 and this
951 is still a DREAM to shift compared!  The A/C in the 911 cars is just
plain poor compared, now the latter ones such as C2's are better, but in
the 993's you will notice the familiar climate control paned of the
951!  the heater in the 911 does work better, to the point of melting
your shoes (once you figure out how to work the levers, hehehehe ).

I guess the big deal for me was my last road trip.  During the Christmas
holidays, I drove from Oklahoma to atlanta, then down to tampa florida,
stayed a week and drove back.  I was a flawless drive at speeds rarely
under 100 mph in my 911( I am totally serious, some 120 mph steady runs
for 100 miles at a time).  I think the entire trip was like 3,000
miles.  The car performed as expected, but I tell you I had to "drive"
that car the entire way.  Even city driving in a 911 is total
concentration.  As soon as you start thinking about the wife,dog,kids,
you suddenly realize you can't get the 911 in second gear, or worse, you
have the embarrassment of killing the car at a light!  On the other hand
this 951 you can sit back and just "ride" in, with all and more of the
performance and creature comforts, but you can still "drive" the 951
anytime you feel like it.  the funny thing is I sold the 81 911 for much
more than I bought my 88 951S, so I don't understand the value for the
$$ with the 911's.  I must say I have totally lost the "wave" factor
with the 951S.  With the 911 (blk/blk) everyone was always looking and
pointing, but I don't think anybody knows this one is a Porsche!  And
really that's ok ;-)

These are just my thoughts on the comparison from my point of view, I
just re read this and it sounds like I am just getting old! haha

Thanks,
Gary
