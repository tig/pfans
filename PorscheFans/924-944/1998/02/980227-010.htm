If new 928s sold for the same price as new 944s, I bet they could
have sold quite a few more.  In '87 my brand-new 944 had a sticker
price of about $28K.  The '87 928 I bought last fall originally
stickered at close to $65K!  Ten years later new 993s could be found
cheaper than that.

Well we may know better, but the average guy - who also thinks
"Porsche" is a one-syllable word - more often than not would
probably agree with that statement.  I have met a number of such
individuals who came into some money and bought a new Porsche as
a status symbol - and you can guess which model they bought.
Most of them didn't even know Porsche made anything else.
