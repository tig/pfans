Hello everyone,

I am brand new to the list, but not to Porsche.  I have owned most every model
the boys from Stuttgart make, have visted the factory and Wessiach, and I am a
professional Porsche mechanic (in training).  Needless to say, Porsche is the
best there is.  My current car is a 86 951, and I have just purchased the
factory service manuals for it (all 6 944 manuals and the turbo sup.) so if
anybody wants any information, I'll be happy to help.


I'd like to respond to several messages-

Menelaos N. Karamichalis:  

You asked about the Bilstien R-2000, and I have some information.  Pick up the
latest copy of Motor Trend (March) and there is a small article on the
subject.  The Machine is basically a big filter, able to filter out 2 microns
of particles.  The stock filter can maybe go as low as 20, so you see the
advantage.  It costs about 100 bucks and you can call 1-800-655-0090 to find a
location nearest you. 

I would, however, caution against it if your car has high mileage.  Many of
the deposits around the seals in the engine could break free, resulting a
horrible leaking problems.  You see, the sludge in the engine is definietly
not good for anything, but it does form a film around seals.  When this sludge
is cleaned, you run the risk of leaks galore.  The phenomenon is similar to
people discovering leaks after swtiching to Synthetic oil on higher mileage
cars.  The synthetic cleans the engine, removing the grime and causing leaks
everywhere.  

That said, the R-2000 is a big help otherwise.  It will prolong the life of
your engine considerably, and helps in small performance ways too.  

Ole Olsen and Lenny B. Ramjattan - 

In response to your Audi / VW heritage questions, the answer is simple.
Lenny's history is almost correct, except for the fact that the 924 was a
Porsche designed model.  As early as 1973 VW wanted Porsche to design a
sucessor to the 914 for the VW lineup, and it came in the form of the 924.
But VW faltered and gave up on the idea of building it as a VW, and Porsche
bought their own design back.  All 924's and 944's were made at Neckarsulm, an
Audi plant North of Ingolstadht (where the Audi A8 is made today).  But the
engines starting with the 944 2.5 were all Zuffenhausen, in fact they are half
of the 928 block.  

The relationship of Porsche/ Audi/ VW is that of a constortium.  VW owns Audi
outright.  It looked like Porsche was going to be bought by VW in the early
70's, but Porsche managed to retain family controlling interest by going
public (stock).  But the companies all share parts and designs.  Some notable
on the 944 are the CV joints and most electronics (Bosch).  But make sure the
VW/ Audi part you buy is correctly matched to the Porsche standards before you
buy.  Most VW dealers have a cross-reference list availble.  You will see the
four rings and the VW sign on many parts, just look for them.

"Bad"  Bob-

In response to your caliper rebuilding issue, it all comes down to the type of
caliper you have.  If it is a floating caliper, the job is fairly simple.
Removing the piston and seal is no big job, and I believe you can get
replacement shim pins from Porsche.  

But if the job is a fixed caliper, it is harder.  Porsche does not recommend
that you split the caliper, ever!  I agree, as an imperfect seal would cause
brake fluid to leak out.  So, the question is how to I get the pistons out and
the seals.  The answer is harder yet.  You can use shop air to blow the
pistons out (BE CAREFULL) but undoubtably one will come out before the others
and the air will leak away.  Once this happens, you have to take a rubber
insert (sold at most brake places) that acts as a suction device the blocks
the remaining holes up while the other pistons can be freed.  After all this
comes the difficult task of bleeding the caliper.  In order to fully do this,
you have to rotate the claiper to make sure all the air is out.  By rotating,
the air is motivated by gravity to come out.  It is very hard.  If you need
help, I have the factory service manuals and several brake job books.
