Hi Mark-
I'll be swapping transaxles in a little while and I could do some work =
with that. I did have a thought - would it make more sense to use stills =
with text and graphics? I like the video idea but when I try and figure =
out hot to shoot the transaxle swap while doing the work my self I can't =
figure out how to make it work nice. Tough to get a good camera position =
and be in the shot at the same time!! A good series of stills would =
contain more detail and the images could be annotated and have an =
accompanying text. Sort of like the PorscheFans official factory manual. =
(I wouldn't be surprised if some of the factory manual text =
'accidentally' showed up, or something just dissimilar enough to keep =
the lawyers happy.) This could be transmitted over the net, burned on to =
CDs real easy. If some folks still wanted to include video we could add =
in video clips to the CD!=20
Just my two cents - I think that text and stills (lots of stills) will =
show the procedures better. It might even convince me to buy a digital =
camera. (just played with some last weekend, great toys.)
I should have mentioned this earlier but it just came to mind after the =
recent discussion about the factory manuals and then marks note about =
the videos.
