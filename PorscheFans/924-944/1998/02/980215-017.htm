Okay, I'm beginning to not like the shop I got service quotes from.  To do
a belt & water pump replacement, this is what he gave me:

Auxiliary Shaft Belt, Parts Information; 944.102.219.04 ; $41.70
Timing Belt, Parts Information; 944:105.157.04; $13.30
Timing Belt Tensioner, Roller; 944.105.273.02; $23.45
Timing Belt Tensioner, Gear; 944.105.027.04; $41.70
Water Pump w/out Turbo; 951.106.921.X; $400
Water Pump Replacement, w/out Turbo; 8.4hr @ 60/hr; $504

So with our nice 8.25 LA County sales tax, that comes to $1067.06 for the job.

What really gets me is the water pump.  I see people talking of new ones
for under $200, with a returnable core refund between $50-$100.  I'm
curious as to what others think of this pricing and est labor time, and
recommend in the way of alternative pump suppliers.

Also, I'm getting a little disgusted with the few shops I've talked to in
my area, can anyone else recommend a good Porsche shop in the LA/South Bay
area?
