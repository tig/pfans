Well El Nino struck last night!  Trying to get around a semi during 
torrential rain yesterday I hit a freeway pothole at about 50 mph.  
The front rim is bent and the tire cut.  I need a decent stock front 
wheel.  This is the 86' non-ABS standard 7Jx16(front) pressure cast light
aluminum alloy wheel.  The wheel does not have to be 'perfect' but 
should be in relatively good condition(a few normal tire change 
scratches is OK.)  If anyone has one wheel they are willing to sell, 
please email me directly.

Also, a few other questions:
1: Regarding the above incident, what should I look at in the way of 
damage to the suspension?  Visually the A-arm looks straight.  There 
is maybe a tiny bit of extra play in the upper attachment point of 
the strut compared to the other side, but the car does have 115,000 
miles and the original shocks.

2: I want to replace the power steering hose with the updated 
version.  It leaks and the hose clamp has gouged the end to the point 
it won't stop leaking. (I already sanded the seams smooth on the 
resevour).  The price on the hose to the pump from Zims was $29.50 
plus a different fitting fro $5.45.  The other hose was $149.95!  Do 
most people replace both hoses?  Both seem to be leaking, but it 
appeared the more expensive hose might be easy to get rebuilt.  It 
this a good alternative???

3: Finally, regarding the wheel, where would you suggest I call in 
terms of salvage yards here in Southern California to find it if the 
list doesn't come up with one?

Thanks to anyone who can help.
