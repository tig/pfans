Sorry Gary, I didn't have your email address so I sent this to the list.
There does not seem to be anything wrong with buying a used set of chips
as long as the seller is someone you know and trust.  I purchased a set
of chips through this list and have had no problems with it.  Autothority
verified that it is one of their chips and purchased legit.

I have a set that will work in an 88S that is the APE Stage II.  I have
the set which I purchased as mentioned above and I also have a set that
came with Paul's car.  I will sell either set for US$200 including
shipping to your door.  You get your choice of boost bolts, one is
slightly higher boost than the other.

This offer, of course is open to anyone else too :)
