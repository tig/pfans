Everyone who has a leaky steering gear...listen up, I've found an
inexpensive cure!  Instead of doing something like calling Griffith's
and  dealing with an extremely RUDE and impatient person about buying
another rack, or shopping around for the best price on one, try this. 
At a local gas station, I found some STP Power Steering Fluid/Stop
Leak!  Now, I was skeptical at first, since there was no dexron-III
rating on the bottle.  But I was tired of adding a quart of that red
stuff every week.  Heck, at that point, I didn't even CARE if I ruined
the pump.  So I bought it and poured it in.  Not much of a difference,
until after the 2nd bottle, when the red lines I was leaving in the
driveway started turning to dribbles.  Finally, after the 3rd bottle,
there was no sign of a leak, anywhere!  Now it's 2 months later and
everything is still fine, even the pump.  This stuff could probably be
found fairly easily at an auto parts store, or convenience store. Give
it a try if you've got those leaky seal blues!
