Wow,  I did not mean to strike a nerve, but strike one I did.  I offer my 
apologies for creating an atmosphere of discontent.

This morning I did not have time to fully research my statements, but 
nothing I said was incorrect.

I will try to reiterate what I said, and I can provide my reference 
material this time.

First, the question of gearing.  I pulled my 944S owners manual, which is 
really the same manual for all three models (944, 944S, and 944 Turbo).  
The manual transmission variants are as follows for the 1987 U.S. models:

  944
1st   3.600 : 1
2nd   2.125 : 1
3rd   1.458 : 1
4th   1.071 : 1
5th   0.730 : 1
Axle  3.889 : 1

  944S
1st   3.500 : 1
2nd   2.059 : 1
3rd   1.400 : 1
4th   1.034 : 1
5th   0.829 : 1
Axle  3.889 : 1

  944 Turbo
1st   3.500 : 1
2nd   2.059 : 1
3rd   1.400 : 1
4th   1.034 : 1
5th   0.829 : 1
Axle  3.375 : 1

Again, this is strait from the Porsche owner's manual and it is obvious 
that the 944S has the same final axle ratio, but the gear ratios are the 
same as the Turbo.  As you can see that the lower the gear ratio, the 
faster the car will travel for a given rpm.  Comparing 5th gear between 
the 944 and the 944S you will see that the 944S has a HIGHER number, 
therefore it MUST have a lower velocity at the same rpms.  Remember, the 
final axle ratio is the same for the 944 as the 944S.

David Coleman's article "Porsche 944S: Proud Heir" (Excellence, August 
1988) cites that 944S is geared lower and that "The S shares the same 
gear ratios with the Turbo. The only twixt the two is the substitution in 
the S of the base 944's rear axle ratio of 3.889:1 for the Turbo's taller 
3.375:1. The compromise gearing of the S allows it to keep its 16 valves 
operating at maximum efficiency more often, turning a busy 2,900 rpm at 
60 mph in top gear. This compares to the Turbo's lazy 2,300 rpm count at 
60, and even the standard 944's relaxed 2,450 rpm for the same speed" 
(Excellence, 1987, pp. 51).

Even though the 944S winds the tachometer needle further for the same 
forward velocity that the 944 requires, the top speed of the 944S exceeds 
the 944 due to the extra horse power (40 hp).  When the 944 tops out at 
the factory claimed 131 mph it is turning about 5,350 rpm. When the 944S 
is traveling at the claimed top speed of 142 mph it is turning 6,860 (red 
line).  The 944 is drag limited due to its lower power.  Again, these are 
factory specifications.

I have never pushed the 944S to its limits, but I have put the 944 to its 
top speed limits and 131 mph is about right.  My Turbo will make both 
cars seem like they are running on two cylinders, topping out at 162 mph 
(red line limited).

As for the driving style of the two cars, this is a bit more subjective, 
but I would believe that most people would agree that the 944S, with its 
16 valve peaky motor, will beg to be driven in the upper rpm range wher 
it works best.  Coleman wrote "Although the S never felt particularly 
strong below 4,000 rpm, the extra 30 horsepower of the S powerplant 
immediately manifested themselves, and at this point, the 16 valve car 
would simply rocket away from the standard 944. Unfortunately, this 
tended to happen at such patently illegal speeds that the comparison 
becomes moot in normal driving" (Excellence, 1988, pp. 48).  Coleman 
further states "because the 944 produces more torque below 2,000 rpm than 
the S, the marginally lighter 944 jumps the S off the line in 
acceleration, turning a slightly quicker time from 0 to 100 feet (3.2 
seconds vs. 3.3 for the S). Once the S begins coming on the cams, there 
is no contest between the two, as the S snatches the lead for good above 
30 mph" (Excellence, 1987, pp. 48).

Factory weights for the 944 and 944S come in at 2778 and 2866 pounds 
(curb weight).  The extra 88 pounds does not mean too much as far as 
performance goes.  Other years may have different curb weights.  
Nevertheles, the 944S, in stock trim, is faster than a stock 944, but not 
by a whole lot.

Some personal observations:

Another thing that the S shares with the S2 is the infamous plastic valve 
chain guide that requires periodic replacement.  Failure to do so can set 
your bank account back a cool $3,000 to $4,000 when Mister Piston and is 
associates meet Mister Valve and friends for an unscheduled meeting.  
Cost of ownership is a bit pricier than the standard 944, but not as bad 
as the Turbo models.

If this is your first car, I would recommend the 944 as a good entry 
point.  Moving to the 16 valve cars or the Turbo is a logical progression 
when you fully understand, and accept, how much financial damage you can 
do if something goes wrong.  It is better to not get beaten up too badly 
when you become a new Porsche owner.

The 944S has a streak of rarity, but it does not change the price too 
much compared to the 944.  I like my S and I am happy with the car, but 
for trolling around in a leisurely way, the 944 is a better fit.  If you 
like to make the engine sign at high rpm, the S has a rewarding torque 
peak at the 4,300 rpm range, where as the 944 remains flat as a pancake 
until it drops at about 5,300 rpm.  Compare this to the S where it 
remains nearly level until 6,000 rpm and then drops off to the red line.

Although I disagree with Ganguly on the ability and personality of the 
stock 944 and stock 944S, Ganguly is right on the mark with his closing 
paragraphs.  The 944 is not a car, it is a marque, and one that I enjoy 
every day of my life.

Post Script:

Patrick, I appoligize for not having your address.

Cut for brevity...
>>Having said all that Patrick, any example of an early 8v car you can find
