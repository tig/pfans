Bill Bechtold inquired if others had Gold Fuchs wheels, and from my
conversation today with George Beuselinck, I have those wheels, and probably
the gold variety. What I can tell you for sure about the color is that the
background is gold in the crest area, so presume that means they are the
gold ones. Otherwise, they are 7J x 15 on front and 8J x 15 on rear, not the
16 inch ones mentioned in your post as stock for the Turbo.

While on the keyboard, let me tell you that George B. gave me the Zim's
phone number (800) 356-2964 for parts, and I have to agree with George that
the prices are better than I have been hearing. I had heard $65 and up for
slave cylinder for 944 clutch, and if I heard right, they are $50.50 at
Zim's. I ordered them, so will advise if the price is not as stated. Zim's
also said the rebuilt water pump is more reliable than new, based on their
return experience, and costs only $69.50 plus the old core (or $100 if you
don't have a core). Timing belt is only $8.95, and balance shaft belt $24.95.

I've started to video the clutch slave replacement, and am indebted to
George for some tips like raise the rear end of the car when bleeding it
after the installation.

Thanks, George.
