     Thanks for the info.  Here's a new clue.  When I drove the car home 
     from work, it drove perfectly.  We have had record rainfall here in 
     Florida the last month.  When I told my wife what happened she 
     reminded me that yesterday morning and the other morning I complained 
     about the idle were both Mondays.  In both cases the Mondays followed 
     Sundays during which the car was not driven and it rained like you 
     wouldn't believe.  The car was outside in the rain both times.  My 
     idea is that something must be getting damp and after it has time to 
     dry out, it doesn't affect the running of the motor. This in mind, I 
     drove the car to work this morning and it ran perfectly normal. Does 
     this lead to any particular culprit?
     
     Thanks in advance for all help,
     Samuel

Sam,
     
You have a vacuum leak in the induction system, or a vacuum line 
has cracked or come off somewhere.   Check everywhere downstream 
from the air flow meter.
