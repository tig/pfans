hi all,

I have decided to start autocrossing !

my friend talked me into it and he just found a local club for us to 
race in.  

I remembered reading an article of a guy who had just bought a harness 
and compared the difference of seatbelt/harness to using the steering 
wheel as a grab bar/steering utensil. I really want to beat my friend so 
I figured I needed all the help I could. He has autocrossed before but 
not too much. He has a 1st Generation RX7 vs. my 1980 924. I hope I win 
:) I usually beat him outta the lights but he is getting better all the 
time :(.  anyway I am looking for a cheap harness

it must have- 5 inch nylon belt ( i think they all do )
            - 5 or 6 point ( i dont care which one )
             
- I don't know a whole lot about em so if you respond try to sell it to 
me,Tell me everything you know about it . 

Basically I am looking for something cheap which i can put in and out 
once a month or so dosent have to look good just as long as it will hold 
me good.

thx 
danl
