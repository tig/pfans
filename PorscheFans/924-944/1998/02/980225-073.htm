There was discussion about this a while back, but....
After replacing the heater valve on my '86 951, I wish to bleed the air
from the cooling lines.  Someone recommended using an old resovoir cap
and pressurizing the system, but, not having the inclination to make
such a device, I wish to bleed it hot with the engine running.  Before
doing so I hoped to get some advice.  The location of the bleeder on my
engine has the screw pointing right at the timing cover and it appears
likely that much coolant will spew forth into my newly replaced belts
and all over the front of the engine.  Someone else recommended large
quantities of paper towels, but I would imagine that the volume of hot
coolant coming out would not prevent soaking the front of the engine. 
Are there any other recomendations, or should I just go for it and bleed
away without worry?
Secondly, after replacing the valve, there was moisture inside the small
relief/hole on the top of the bellhousing that appears to look down into
the clutch and pressure plate.  Instead of driving the car, I hoped that
letting it sit for a few days and allowing the coolant to evaporate was
better than spreading whatever coolant accumulated throughout the clutch
and into the throwout bearing.  The clutch is only 8000 miles old, and
the leak is recent.  How much damage has been done, or am I okay for a
while?  Thanks!!
