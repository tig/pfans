On Tue, 3 Feb 1998 14:15:52 EST, BadBob951@aol.com so eloquently stated:

>In a message dated 98-02-03 12:48:56 EST, you write:

><< The S box has hardened 1st and 2nd gears, a LSD and oil cooler.

Non-S turbos were available with oil cooler and limited slip, but these
were not standard.  Type 016R, Code 5P had the cooler, and Code 5R had
both cooler and LSD.  Type 016S, Code UY had no cooler or LSD, and Code =
9U
had no cooler, but LSD.

So that means the only real difference for the S box is blasting (some
type of shot peening) of 1st and 2nd gears, which is not really the same
as hardening, which implies heat treatment.  If you are doing an overhaul
you can do this at the same time.

>Also, regular diffs wear out.  They use a friction surface (like a =
clutch or
>brake) to transfer the torque to the wheel that's not spinning.

You can enhance lock-up by using Red Line synthetic 75W90NS, which is =
"non
slippery" formula.

>The Torsion diff uses a worm gear type arangement and doesn't wear

Actually, it is Torsen, which is named after the inventor.

>normal LSD can transfer up to about 60% of the torque to the wheel

I think the Porsche LSD is set at around 40%.  Racing diffs are set =
higher
and work appropriately less smoothly.

> a torsion LSD transfers up to about 95% of the torque to the wheel

As long as the wheel that is wants to slip is on the ground.  If that
wheel comes off the ground (unlikely in a 944), you essentially have an
open differential.
