I agree with Chris.  Given how zealously Porsche is protecting their
crest (you can't even buy a Porsche crest horn button for your Momo
anymore!), I'm sure they would nail anyone who tried to do this without
their permission.  I wonder if another way around this is to use our
leverage with the PCA (I bet this list represents a sizable portion of
their membership) and have them contact Porsche directly.  If the PCA
has as much political pull with Porsche as the BMWCCA has with BMW, they
might be able to convince Zuffenhausen (or Atlanta) to either A) finally
produce a soft copy, B) let us do it, or C) let the PCA do it.
