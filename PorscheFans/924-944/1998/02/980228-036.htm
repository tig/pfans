You said:

<<So I was thinking,
since that tape holder lid is busted anyway (altohugh usable thanks to the
winderful invention of Velcro(tm)), maybe that could be replaced by a piece
with a hole or two for holding drinks.  I've plastic vacuum and injection
molding equipment for pieces about that size, but wasn't sure what the
depth was.  Is it possible to go any deeper than the tray is now?
Otherwise I can raise the height a bit, but if it looks too tacky, I won't
even bother.>>

I thought about the same thing a few years ago.  Unfortunately, when you take
the cassette holder off, you run into trans tunnel.  A drink holder would have
to be very shallow, and would interfere with your elbow during shifting, I'm
afraid.  I took out all the cassette holder plates and found the console
holder is perfect for storing the Valentine One out of sight ot prying eyes
when the car is parked.
