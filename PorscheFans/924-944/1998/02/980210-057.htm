To All:

The Haynes manuals for the 944 ARE grossly incomplete. I have told
readers about this problem. If you have a 944 and need more info on the
transaxle, you need to buy the 924 manual as that has the info for the
924 turbo gearbox which is the same as most of those following except
the units with oil coolers. This is an example.
For a 931 owner with 4-wheel disc brakes, you have to buy the 944 manual
to get that info. We have tried to bridge this lack of information buy
offering articles in Excellence Magazine for the last fout years.

Another example is the 1986 944 wiring diagram which is actually a 951
diagram. Most of the information you need is there, except things that
really go wrong, like the sunroof mechanism, remote hatch latch, etc.
But one warning to any 944 owner, DO NOT use the information on timing
and balance shaft belt replacement for any more than just replacement.
You MUST USE a tensioner gauge to verify and all adjustments and tension
on the 944/924S/968 belts. The Haynes info will get things back into
place correctly, if followed, but there are many gaps in their process
which could result in a belt failure or worse, especially in a 16V
engine.

Follow the factory procedure or my interpetation of it.
