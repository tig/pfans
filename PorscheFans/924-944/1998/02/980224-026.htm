>Hi Nick, did'nt you change your suspension to aftermkt upgraded parts?

Yes, Wes, my S2 suspension has been replaced throughout, so it's stiffer
than usual, but it's only lowered 3/8 inches.  The 968 I drove had
non-sport suspension, but it felt almost as stiffly sprung as mine, as
judged by "push-down-on-the-front-and-back" tests and mildly spirited
driving on curves.  Part of the feel may have been the wider17 inch wheels
with major rubber.  But still, the seat felt higher, not necessarily the
ride height.

Tom, it didn't feel loosely connected, just detached.  I think my
impression was that the 968 chassis was stiffer.

Yeah, there's the rub. Would have to start over again on the suspension. 
But I've essentially got all the 968 M030 stuff on my S2, and it cost
around $2200.  Less if I'd installed the torsion bars myself. 

Maybe there comes a time to stick w/ what you've got. What's another 26-28
hp anyway? (I have a bad cold, or I would never say that.)

I agree w/ Jim Richmond's post. We all need 2 Porsches. One for
experimenting, and the other playing backup so we don't go insane not
having a Porsche to drive.

And no, Adrien, I'm not in charge of taking Lee's chronically neglected 968
for walks thru the Chicago countryside.
