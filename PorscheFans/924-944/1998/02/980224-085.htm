My stock plugs were single electrode WR5DC (used only a few thousand
miles).  I replaced them with the tri-electrode WR7DTC.  For a daily
driver the '7' would be better as it reaches operating temp faster.  I
just filled up today after driving 403 miles on the last tank of gas and =
I
got 23.7 mpg.  Prior to that the best I had gotten in the same daily type
driving was 22.1 (7% increase), so it appears that they indeed do work, =
at
least in the 16-valve engines like my S2.

List price on the plugs from Porsche was $5.80.  I paid $4.93 or 15% off.
