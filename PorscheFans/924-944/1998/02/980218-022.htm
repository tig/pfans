Yes, and it depends.  How much time are you willing to spend
on the job?

I changed the water pump and belts on my car, and the only
previous kind of work I had done was oil/brake pad changes
and valve adjustments.  I bought the factory service manuals,
belt tension tool, and various other Porsche tools.  I read
George B.'s water pump replacement procedure and Jim Pasha's 
_Excellence_ article (both list members).

It took me over a month.  That was two years ago and the car
has run great since.

It's really not that hard if you're _patient_ and you're
willing to buy the necessary tools and manuals.  The nice
part is that if you get into trouble, you can always fall
back on the advice of the list.
