Derek,

You make a convincing argument for the MFS.  If the extra noises it
makes coincides with huge increase in performance I'm sure I would grow
to like the sounds.  My previous experience with MFS was negative as I
got the noise but no power increase.  My car was totally stock then
except for the MFS.  I'm sure I'm going to try it again soon as it is my
bottle neck in the chain of flow.  Unlike your car, my car has a great
bottom end(I like my car like I like my women), with a less dramatic
surge in power when my K27DR kicks in.

Have you had any problems with the MFS or did you just install and go.
Did your car have to be retuned after installing or on later dates.
Any info will be appreciated.

Randall Morton
