>Well, I have this to add to the NSX/Porsche debate:

>Hondas were my favorite cars for the past eight years.  Until I 
purchased my
>944T.  Sure, Hondas have excellent reliability, but, they are 
'soulless'
>machines.  I really liked my Civic EX Coupe:  started everyday, rarely 
had a
>problem (dash lights, warped rotors), and got great gas mileage.  I 
even
>thought it was fast.  Enter the 944.  Well, what can I say?  There is 
no
>comparison at all.  Of coures this is a US93$13,800 Civic compared to a
>US87$29,000 944 Turbo.
>
>I have only sat in an NSX, never driven one.  My Honda service advisor 
drove
>one and advised me that it was everything I thought it could be.
>
>After a few late night drags with NSXs, I must say that it is less.  I 
have
>never seen the back of an NSX from the cockpit of my 951. :)

Boy if I was called hotmacho for my remark, I'm just guessing what she 
would call you Clark...
