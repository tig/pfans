Well 
I guess I called wolf and learned something.
When the stud gave a little.  What I was refering to was a loss in effort
required to turn the nut.  My first thought was that this expensive block just
let loose or something equally dreadful.

As it turns out...

The washer under the nut had begin to move.

The comment in the manual about making sure the washer does not turn was worth
note.  When the slip surface moved from the nut/washer combo to the washer
head combo the torque required to move the nut dropped quite a bit.  

I can see that if you were torqueing to a ft lbs value the movement of the
washer would through it way off and possibly result in over torqueing.

Oh well alls well that ends well. I guess

As for the groups' video, I could have knocked out several chapters in the
last few days.  Head, H20 pump, rollers, belts.......

Had to go back to work tonight and won't be able to finish up till sometime
during the week.
