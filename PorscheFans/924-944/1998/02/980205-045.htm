Dave,
  I might have an idea what is going on. I have an 87' 944 that had similar 
problems when I first bought it. The wiper controls would act really wierd. 
I got bold, and took apart the switch assembly under the steering wheel. 
Remember the cartoons where someone unscrews one screw in a clock, and the 
clock explodes in their face with springs, parts, etc. flying in all 
directions? Same potential here. The mechanism that holds all this together 
is pop riveted together. You have to (carefully) drill out the pop rivits to 

get it opened up. What might be going on, is the complex layers of switch 
contacts, levers, and springs might have come apart in a couple of places. 
There is no way for me to tell you which ones. You have to be a bit of a 
scientist to figure out how it works by just looking at it. Just make sure 
you take it apart VERY SLOWLY!! If not, "toon time!" I used zip ties to lock 

it back together. Sounds hoakey, but it holds. Just cut the locking end off 
one, feed in a new one, and place the cut off lock on the other end. Do this 

for all the pop rivits you drill out. Some hobby clamps help as a second set 

of hands to hold it together as you put the zip ties in. Make sure all 
levers work before you put it back in the car. None of the positions should 
grap or be hard to engage. Might want to clean all contacts with some 
electrical contact cleaner while you have it open too. Just take your time.  


  I WILL ISSUE THIS WARNING....IF YOU ARE NOT GOOD WITH SMALL, COMPLEX 
MECHANISMS, DO NOT TAKE THIS THING APART!! 
  If you are not willing to take this thing apart, you may have to just buy 
a new one from PORSCHE (hold on to your wallet though). This switch assembly 

is the only thing I can think of that would cause your problem. Good Luck!

     Todd Kent
     87' 944 NA (still bleading from it's heart attack)
     ((Thanks to the other Dave at mcn.net of your opinion about that! I am 
going to let the mechanic install the valve.))
