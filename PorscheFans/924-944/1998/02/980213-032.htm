Hi all,

I received my block from Motor Works the other day.  Total bill was $720
(including $80 shipping fee).  Bill was something like:

$75 hone 3 cylinders
$75 deck block
$250 liner
$200 liner installation.

I don't know how the prices compare with anything else, but I guess I'm happy
to have the block back.  The 2-4 cylinders are smooth and clean and the 1st one
is brand new.

I now need to transfer the raceware head studs from my old engine to my new
one.  The method seems to be heat up the block, double nut the studs and
unscrew them out.

When I put them in, what loctite should I use?  I guess I want a loctite that
doesn't make it impossible to get the studs out, but does keep the studs in the
block.

THanks!
