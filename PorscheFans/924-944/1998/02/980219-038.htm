I've been looking at the schematics in the back of the
Haynes manual the past couple of nights.  Specifically
the diagram on page 209 (1990 edition, though the back
page lists cars as new as 1995...)

It definately states that the extra lights are for
rear fogs.  But shows the wiring also being connected
to the 'USA only' side marker lamps.  (This makes some
sense as the side marker lights are daisy-chained from the
rear taillight assembly.)

Do the ROW cars actually have seperate instrument panel
switch for front and rear fog lights?  Because that is
what the diagram seems to show at the top of the page.
My (USA) car only has one fog switch, and I note that
there is a blank spot next to it.  If ROW cars have seperate
switches for front and rear fogs, where does the switch
for the extra driving lights go for ROW S/Turbo models?
Or am I missing something obvious?

I'm now wondering if there is some sort of patch in US cars
to apply side marker power to the lead - even though
this isn't shown in the Haynes manual.  I won't have a
chance to actually look at the car until the weekend.
