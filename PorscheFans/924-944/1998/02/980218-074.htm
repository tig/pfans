The Haynes manual does a pretty good job on this one. I would add that it was easier to remove the shift lever and thereby gain some working room to to slide the shift rod forward. After removing the shift boot etc as per Haynes; pry back the front and back of the rubber boot at the base of the shift lever. There will be 2 10mm bolts, one in front and one in back. Remove them and work the lever out. Do not push the rod too far forward or you may get into the brake lines

Like another responder, I favor removing the transmission entirely at this point to gain working room and also a lighter unit to manuever later when seperating the clutch bell housing.

 Follow the Haynes directions and yes as you ask below you must use something to 'shim' the driveshaft tourque tube so it does not 'hang'. I have not used the piece they depict, but the next time I think it worthwhile to make one to use! Also, you need to support the front of the engine. With all the stuff removed from the aft end the engine is going to pivot nosedown on the mounts. This will exacerbate the torque tube sag and ALSO make it even harder to reach to pesky clutch bellhousing bolts!

Having removed the transmission you can do the above AFTER:

opening the bellhousing. Cause you cant get room to seperate the bell housing and the drive tube and then work the bell housing out! The driveshaft will protrude too far forward. So you must do as specified in Haynes and pull the torque tube with bell housing back to gain just enough (plenty really) of access to remove the clutch pressure plate and disc per Haynes THEN you can remove the bellhousing from the tube. (Loosen the 17mm bolts holding the bell housing and tube together before seperating the bell housing from the block. They may be REAL tight after all these years and it will be harder to loosen while they flop around)

Plugs should not be a problem but you will probably have to remove the starter. Oops. Starter is already off for the rest of the job. I forgot. Other wise, if the nuts have been on there it can be a ?#@%& getting at acouple of them. Enjoy.

4 speed, 5 speed, same difference for your purposes. The only significant difference to this procedure is between the Porsche and Audi units ( /9 or /Z aka Snail Shell).

No, you convince me; I had a hell of a time getting that sucker out. Yes, replace it.. Haynes is maybe a little wrong in my limited experience. The bearing I got came as a complete unit for the low low Porsche price of $79. AW shoot. Cant find the bolt. The forward end of the bearing unit is threaded. Get the new one then get a bolt that will fit and long enough to go all the way through and out the front. You will have trouble finding a bolt long enough to thread in and still protrude far enough to get vise grips on with room enought to knock the bearing out; but you can keep stuffing bits of hard wooden dowel in and then running the bolt down on that untill the bearing is forced out. Use the same bolt to gently tap the new bearing into place.
