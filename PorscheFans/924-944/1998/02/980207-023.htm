««I sent a list of questions last week, but I only got 2
responses...Maybe 
I am being ignored since I am not like George B., or Mr. Istook, or 
something...anyway, here they are again:»»
              ------ From 5 Feb -------

Hi everybody,
when I read this message, it had make me think. I haven't repost to the
author just because I don't know the answers.
I've learned a lot in this digest, and I hope that when I have a
question someone answers me, even if I'm not one of the most known
personages, or I don't write a very good English, or I own a 924 (not
so performant as the 944), or...
In some months reading the digest religiously every day (sometimes with
1 or 2 days delay), my special thanks to Vaughan Scott, Thore B.
Karlsen and some others (mainly who answered to one of my first posts,
"Oil pressure failure"). I hope that I can count on you when I need.
There are not many Porsches around here, and sometimes I really need
help.
Please, boys, keep helping who is not so experienced with this cars.
Just my thoughts. Sorry for the bandwidth, but it is weekend, and there
are more bw free.
Regards,
Jorge Mota Veiga
jorgemotaveiga@mail.telepac.pt
Proudly owning a 924.
