I purchased an 85.5 944 two weeks ago, and have since put on 800 miles,
mostly LA city/highway driving (remember highway driving here is more stop
& go than city driving).  The PO has used Castrol GTX 20W50 for the 30,000
miles he owned the car.  Anyway, in the 800 miles I've put on, I've used
about half a quart.

I had been considering switching to Mobil1, but one mech I talked to
recommended against it considering this car has seen 155k miles using
naturals.  He said it would experience a bit of a "shock" going to a
synthetic.  Same for switching transmission fluids to synthetics, he says. 
Can anyone debunk or verify his assertations?
