The Haynes manual only discusses the power antenna that was
present on 1995 and prior models.  From 1995.5 onwards, the
antenna is in the windshield.

There are actually two connections.  The first one is obvious - the
coaxial input itself.  The second is less so - it is the power
connection for the Fuba preamp.  This wire is routed along with
the coax thru a length of tubing.  Symptoms of a disconnected
preamp are:

	- Almost zero AM reception (unless you are a mile or less
	from the transmit site)
	- Only strong FM stations can be received.

The power lead should be connected to the 'power antenna' connection
on your radio.

The preamp itself is on the underside of the battery box, i.e.,
the other side of the firewall from what Lee is describing.  (It
is a small black box behind the glove box which says 'FUBA' on it.)
There is only one connection - the wire leading to the windshield.
The coax/power lead is soldered to the preamp board so is not
likely to fail.
