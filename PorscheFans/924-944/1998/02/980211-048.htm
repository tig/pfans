The circuit is a simple bridge, but again it would only be valid at startup.
Once you get the oil moving all sorts of variable come into play. 

*	How hot it is effects how quickly it comes back down to pan.
*	How fast the motor is running effects pump flow rate

In an ideal system, you would keep the oil out of the pan (dry sump) and let
it be cooled ans then pumped though the motor dropped to pan then pumped out
to cooler.

	Dan,
	    Thanks for the response. I am really surprised the ckt only
checks at 
	startup, that is a bummer. Where exactly is the circuit located? I
ask because 
	I would like to try and take advantage of the sensor in my oil pan
by buying 
	the electronics used, or building my own version of the electronics,
and 
	installing it. Is this just another little black box, or is it built
into the 
	dash or DME? Anyone have the electronics for sale?
	Thanks,
	       Ezra
