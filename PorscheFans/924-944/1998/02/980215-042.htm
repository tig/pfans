All:

Today, after a spirited drive in the country, my S2 began leaking coolant onto
my garage floor.  Dreading a failed water pump, I opened the hood, expecting
the worst.  I found that the leak emanated from a steel fitting that is
interference fit into the aluminum throttle body.  Coolant drawn through a
rubber hose from the overflow tank is circulated through the throttle body,
evidently to warm and/or cool the incoming mixture (another steel fitting next
to the one that leaked removes the coolant).  Mine had worked its way loose.
Like a dope, I pulled on the fitting a bit, and the built up pressure caused
it to fly out, giving me a nice green shower.  After I toweled off, I saw that
the fitting is knurled, and I guess over the years the exposure to hot and
cold had loosened it up from the aluminum.

Has anyone else experienced this phenomenon? (The loose fitting, not the
shower.)  Do you turbo guys have anything similar?  It seems like a device
that is virtually guaranteed to fail, so be aware.  

BTW, I repaired mine the way I repair everything in my life--with a big old
glob of JB Weld.
