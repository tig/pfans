Well, I went to my first autocross this weekend in my 924S. I'm a pretty
experienced autocrosser, but have been out of it for the last year or
so. I did pretty good, I competed in a PAXed (equalized) street tire
class and got second place. I thought that was pretted good considering
the car had zero prep.  The funny thing was that the although the car
feels pretty firm on the street, it felt totally mushy on the track. The
most recent cars I've autocrossed are a Neon ACR, a Shelby GLHS and a
"Street Prepared" RX-7.  The 924 felt very balanced, just mushy, so....

Are the Koni's that are available for the 924/944 (non-M030 suspension)
adjustable without removing them from the car? (both front and rear)
Does anyone know if Tokico Illuminas are available for this application?

One item that I know can make a huge difference in feel in an autocross
is tires. A crummy tire can make the a car feel like it has massive body
roll, etc.  I don't want to go with a race tire (R1, Kuhmo, Hoosier or
something) because I'm to lazy to switch back and forth etc. (I've
decided that I don't have time to be that serious, so why go through the
trouble). Does anyone have any experience with the Yoko AVS
intermediates compared to an "R" tire? I'm not so concerned with
ultimate grip, I'm more concerned with "feel". It's hard to find a Z or
V rated tire in a 205/60, I'm not so concerned with the speed rating,
but a higher speed rating generally implies a stiffer sidewall. Any
suggestions? Heck, I might just get a set of Yoko A023s  and just plan
on buying tires twice a year.

The other mushy part was the brakes. I flushed/bled the brakes good
before the event, but the brakes still felt really mushy. I probably
just need to do pads/lines and that will solve that problem, any
suggestions for pads? I want a pad that is easy on rotors but good for
an occasional lapping session and an occasional autocross.

Geez, was that enough questions?
