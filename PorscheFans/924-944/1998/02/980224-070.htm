Hello p-fans,
  I have been following the list for a few months
now. This list has a great bunch of people and is
a wonderful source of information, and I have learnt 
quite a bit from it but I am still very new to car 
maintenance so bear with me.

I have a overheating problem with my 86 944na,
which I bought 5 months ago.

The temperature guage climbs all the way right up 
to the red mark and I have to turn the heater on to 
get it down a bit. The problem gets exacerbated 
during highway driving. Stop and go driving with
periods of idling at traffic lights helps -> radiator ?

Fans turn on when the temp gets up to the 2/3rd mark.
I checked the airflow after the cooling fans come on while 
idling and noticed a perceptible drop in the air's temperature 
within half a minute or so, though the guage doesn't show 
any significant change in the temp reading. (The fans
always come on together and I saw here in some posts that
one is for the AC and they shouldn't come on together!).

There doesn't seem to be any obvious coolant leak though
I have had to add a bit of fluid in the last month. Not 
knowing when the coolant was last replaced I drained and 
flushed the radiator. Problem persists though not as bad 
as before (I have a 50/50 mixture of water and coolant, 
should I use more water? The FAQ suggests a 2:1 ratio for 
water:coolant, while the instructions on the coolant bottle 
reccomends a range between 1:1 and 3:7).

Also, while idling at normal or above normal temps the
hoses don't seem to be pressurized, i.e. I can squeeze 
them easily, no resistance. Does this imply a leak ?
How do I find where the leak may be? Would the pressure
loss and the resultant lowering in the boiling point
cause this type of problem ?

I have not checked the thermostat as it seems to be a bit
difficult to get out but will do it if necessary.

What should I do now? TIA for your input.

ps: I did an oil change and I have the same question as
    Dieter Schulze about the oil filter.
