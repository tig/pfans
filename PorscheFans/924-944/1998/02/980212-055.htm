I tried the new Cyntex chip which are, from what I understand, manufactured by
the guy who originally did it for Autothority. Made my 89 951 REALLY fast and
definitely stronger than a stage II but, the first ignition chip was bad and
now I'm getting another set because I keep getting fuel shut off. It appears
the DME is sensing an overpressure condition. It limits boost to 1.2 and if you
keep your foot on the floor it tends to cycle at 1.6. Only once did this occur
with max boost, and it seems to have a mind of it's own only wanting to  slow
me down when it wants to. All hoses from the banjo to the waste gate are tight
and in good condition. The cyntex rep is doing a good job trying to make me
happy and is a little puzzled himself. Any one out there got any ideas?
I'll keep you posted on the new set works.
