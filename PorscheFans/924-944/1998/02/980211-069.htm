Well, here is my 2 cents on the manual reproduction debate. Having shelled out
the large bucks for the printed 944 set, which covers most of, but not all of
my 924S, I am glad to have it, and though shocked at the cost upon first
glance, it has paid for itself in short order. Compared to the cost of the
cars, and the parts, the manuals are well, proportional. If I had known about
the 35 dollar micro fiche version I would have gone that route, but I am glad
I did not know.  Now it seems to me that unlike, say a copy of Microsoft
office, which can not be legally had for 15% of its full price in another
version, the price of the fiche represents the value of the INFORMATION
contained within to pcna. Presumeably the high cost of the printed version is
seen as a reasonable price for a dealer to pay, who will be using it
commercially on a frequent and ongoing basis, as opposed to an individual
owner on an occasionaly basis. The latter is clearly being gouged if they want
the printed version. It should not be hard to get pcna to agree to licensing
distribution of a cd rom version to individual owners for something
approaching the cost of the fiche, and they would not even have to provide the
product, just collect some revenues. I'm sure automotion, being in the silicon
valley and all would be happy to make it available for a modest fee. Anybody
from any of those big catalog houses listening? Clearly any unauthorized use
would be bogus, so we should just forget about bootlegging this thing on a
large scale, imho.
