Hi,

So, I've got this 89 Carrera and have been given strict instructions that
I can't take it to the track while in my care :)  I thought I'd give you
guys my impressions of having it for a night, in comparison to my 89 951.

I was expecting there to be many differences between an air cooled 911
and a water cooled 944T, but the exact opposite was the outcome.  Both
cars have a similar feel to them, built strong, doors that shut with
a thud, very satifying controls, good tactile feel, excellent steering,
strong acceleration at the top end of the rpm range, powerful brakes,
good handling and the aura of a Porsche.

There is one area that I just can't get over, it's the sound this 911
makes.  I don't know if it has an exhaust or something, but this thing
sounds soooo good.  It's hard to describe, it sounds so good that I drove
up and down my alley four times last night in 1st gear at 4000rpm just
to hear it bounce off the fences :)  The best sound comes when you get 
up to around 4500rpm in 2nd and let off the throttle, the noise changes
to this very satisfying growl.

The controls on the dash made me laugh out loud the first time I got
to an area where I could see the damn switches.  The sunroof switch is
under the top console, the power mirror controller is nearby the sunroof
switch, the heaters are controlled by levers!  Thank God this car has
seat heaters because for the life of me, I couldn't get anything better
than luke warm air out of the heaters and there was no way I was going to
shut the windows with that glorious exhaust noise trying to get in.
I don't know if I pulled the wrong lever or something, but these cars 
sure stink of oil when you get on it.

The handling of the 911 is very similar to my 944T(S)  Perhaps it's the
stiffer suspension of the "S" parts that make it feel like this, but they
feel very similar in action, both cars oversteer when pushed, the 911
does seem to understeer a bit more at low speeds, but it has a more
positive initial turn-in than my 944T.  The 911 feels very solid going
over railroad tracks, whereas my 944T seems to creak a bit and show it is
less torsionally rigid than the Carrera.  The steering on the 944T is
legendary for a reason, it communicates the truth better than the Carrera.
The 911 is always moving around even when you can see that there is 
no reason for it to be moving.  When the 944's steering moves, you know
there is something happening on the road.  What's interesting is that
the 911 has no power assist, whereas the 944T does, but both feel very
similar at speed, a compliment to the 944T's power steering engineer.

The power of the 911 is pretty damn good.  It's up high so none of this
low end torque crap :)  Once it hits around 4500rpm, it rockets off pretty
good.  I find this engine much more satisfying than the 964 C4 I drove not
so long ago.  I did start to lose interest in the motor though after a few
romps on the loud pedal, it needs another 40-50hp to really keep things
exciting.

The gearbox on the 911 is old, old, old.  Half the time, you pray that it
went into third, a few times it went into fifth, don't worry, I never 
went 2nd to 1st :)  Heel and toe seems impossible, maybe with size 13
German feet you might be able to, but I can't figure out how with anything
smaller.

If you know someone that is looking for a really nice Carrera, perhaps
they should give these guys a call.  The car has 109,000km on it, is
Baltic Blue, runs really, really nice.  It feels like a 40,000km car.
It has heated sport seats, CD player, AC, don't know if it has a heater!

If our new store takes off this summer, I think I'm going to have to add
an air cooled car to the collection, maybe a C2 Turbo or a Carrera.  For
those of you water cooled guys that envy the air cooled dudes, you really
shouldn't, these cars are a lot more alike than you think.

In the end, both cars are a joy to drive;  now, if only I could keep
BOTH of them!

Farzaan.
