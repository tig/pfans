As the subject line states, I have just subscribed to the digest and need
your collective wisdom.

I am looking at buying a 1990 944S2 that I test drove today.  Details are as
follows:

Burgandy in color (sorry, don't know the Official Porsche name)
Linen color leather interior
110,000 miles
NO body damage noted, no dings or paintwork that I can tell
Second owner claims it has never been wrecked
Everything appears to be working (elec. windows, sunroof, pwr mirrors, A/C,
elec adj drivers seat, heat, etc)
The "labeling" on some of the switches is fairly worn so you have to "know"
what the switch does.
Records are complete until 60,000.

This second owner has only had the car 9 mos and says he bought it from a
friend.
He wants to buy a 914 and "fix it up".  He gave me the original owners name
and said I am free to contact him.

I asked him about the gap in the records.  He said that one of the mechanics
at the
local Porsche/BMW/Audi dealer was doing work "on the side" and he took it
directly to him and did not go through the dealer.  Therefore, same quality
work at lower cost.  Guy did not want to document service that the dealer
could tell had not been "purchased" through them.

I called the local dealer and ask for the service department, then asked for
this individual.  He indeed works there, and says he knows the car well, and
it has been serviced to Porsche speck.  This guy confirms the timing belts
were changed at 101,xxx and the car has never had to have anything done
except routine service.

The car drives nicely, and pulls strong.  A small "creak" from the passenger
side area was all that I noted.

The radio disappointed me.  Blaupunkt AM/FM, tape.  I would probably change
this out to an indash CD unit with a little better speakers.

I am having a prepurchase inspection performed in the next few days by a
reputable mechanic that will go through it with a fine tooth comb.

Now my questions are, assuming all is well with the car,

What is a fair price?

How many miles, assuming I continue quality service, can I expect this
engine to last?   I drive about 20K miles/year and am looking to keep this
car 2-3 years.  Just long enough to get my 944 fix.  My commute is 35 miles
one way and is 80% highway, and the remainder nice smooth country 2 lane
roads.  A Porsche kind of commute.

What are things I should be aware of with this car.  This would be my first
Porsche.  I am currently on my second BMW 325i.

I am not familiar with the maintainence regime for this car.  I know it has
timing belts that have to be changed around 60K.  I don't not believe this
car requires "manual" valve adjustments.  What are some of the other big
items to be aware of?

I will knock it off here, because I know I am rambling on.  Looking forward
to hearing from the truly informed and hope to be a regular member of the
digest.

TIA
