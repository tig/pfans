Well guys and gals, I did it.  This past weekend I purchased the 1990 944 S2
that I had been looking at (and asked your collective advice on).

The car has 110K on the odometer but seems to run like new.  Car is in real
good shape and basically needs nothing except a new radio.  Stock radio is
TERRIBLE!

I am looking for good, reasonably priced alternatives to the stock Blaupunkt
Reno 2.  One preferably with an in-dash CD unit.  I'm sure I will have to
improve the speakers to better the quality of the sound, but I am looking to
remain basically stock.  Any suggestions?

Also, someone (Bill Bechtold ?) posted a message about a Jim C chip for
Porsche's.  I am familiar with him from the BMW digest and have one of his
chips in my 92 325i.  Did not know he made them for Porsche as well.  Bill,
or anyone, can you point me in the direction where I can obtain some
information on his chips for Porsche.

One last question.  How can I find out the official Porsche name for the
color of my car.  I call it a "light maroon"?

Look forward to participating on the digest..
