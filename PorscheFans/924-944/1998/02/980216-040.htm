Yes, there are several lower temp thermoswitches available... Won't do much
good without a lower temp thermostat at the same time...

On a turbo, you cannot remove the oil pan without removing the exhaust
crossover pipe and dropping the engine supporting crossmember... Budget a
lot of time for doing both (I would guess about 12-15 hours). While you're
at it, you may as well check/replace your rod bearings to see how much life
you have left in the engine bottom end...

Good Luck!
