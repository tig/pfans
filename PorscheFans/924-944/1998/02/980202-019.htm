How bad can it be if a 951 has been low on coolant for a couple of weeks,
possibly a month but not driven much(~10 miles total)?  I saw a local 87
951 on Saturday morning and it leaks the dreaded green liquid.  The
owner's father said the car was not getting good heat and I immediately
thought of Farzaan's low coolant situation. The heat works now that the
car got more coolant in it.  I am afraid the car may have been damaged by
rust forming internally in the heater core or radiator while the level was
low.  Am I being paranoid? 

Social obligations did not allow me the time to dive in the engine bay on
the spot and see if it was a hose, water pump, head gasket, heater valve
or whatever leak.  

As always, TIA.
