<< The S box has hardened 1st and 2nd gears, a LSD and oil cooler. The
 Quaife diff is a torsen type which transfers drive from the wheel to the
 other as it looses traction where as a normal LSD just locks. Most
 manufacturers use torsen type diffs now and they seem to be the way to
 go. Although you could by a whole S box for the price of a new Quaife
 diff. >>

Also, regular diffs wear out.  They use a friction surface (like a clutch or
brake) to transfer the torque to the wheel that's not spinning.  The Torsion
diff uses a worm gear type arangement and doesn't wear (please hold back with
the "everything wears!" comments).  Finally, from what I've heard, a normal
LSD can transfer up to about 60% of the torque to the wheel that's not
spinning, where a torsion LSD transfers up to about 95% of the torque to the
wheel that's not spinning.
