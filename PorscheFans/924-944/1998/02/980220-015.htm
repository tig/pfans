That's what I recall...

I had _all_ four belts changed, and _all_ rollers and tensioners.  The =
car
had 30,917 miles on it at the time with all parts original.  Prior to =
this
work the engine made a semi-screechy noise when first started for a =
second
or two, and then if you revved it slowly in neutral to about 1600 rpm and
hunted around for the critical speed you could really get it to make the
noise.  This is one of the reasons I had all the rollers, etc. replaced.
That, and the fact that the belts were 8 years old :-)

After replacement everything was dead quiet.  After 1800 miles I had the
tension reset.  Now I'm getting essentially the same noises I got before
all the work.  The shop told me the belts had loosened and this was =
normal
when they are retightened.  They also told me they have been "chasing"
noises in S2s for some time and they never seem to get them to go away.
The engine is quiet when started, but during transient rpm swings through
2000 it will make noise.  It's not really a belt whine, but more of a
noisy bearing sound.  They point to the much wider S2 cam belt as the
culprit.

I talked to the mechanic yesterday, but the owner wasn't available.  I =
may
stop by again today and have him listen to it.  I have about 800 miles on
the car since the retensioning.  I'm not worried about anything breaking,
I just don't like the noise.
