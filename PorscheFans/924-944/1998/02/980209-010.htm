Okay, few more questions from the new 944 owner.

First off, I'm noticing a a slight scraping-like noise from the tranny
while driving.  Only audible when the clutch is out.  If the clutch is
engaged, it's silent as could be.  The tranny fluid level was just a tad
low, nothing I'd normally worry about.  Not knowing what the previous owner
used in there, what should I do to fill it up?  Change the fluid all
together, or is it safe to add something else to it?  Any ideas on the
cause of the noise?  Would it be worth switching to something like Mobil 1
to see if that eliminates the noise?

Second, I can't supply any tactical weapons, but I may be able to sneak a
few FLIR (Forward Looking InfraRed) tracking systems off the production
floor.  Probably work great for picking up those air-coolers ahead of you. 
Installation will of course be discounted for PFans list members.  ATFLIR
units feature multi-target simultaneous tracking & targetting information
for up to 40 targets, with signiture identification.  Dash HUD extra.

Thanks,
