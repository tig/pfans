HI P-fans,

Farzaan, sorry to hear about your bashed window.  It has created more
conserns for my car since it only has stock alarm, which no one would know
even if all the glass were bashed with a metal trashcan.  

You said that you have intergrated the stock alarm into another alarm
system, how did you do it?  My understanding was that 2 alarms were hard to
hook up, especially to match the shut-down times of alarms, so they don't
trigger a forever-going chain effect of horns and sirens.  

Please give advise, system type, more info.  Any help regarding this issue
by anyone is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
tony c.
