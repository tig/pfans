If you are allowed cross drilled *OR* slotted rotors, I would go for the
slotted pieces.  If however, you are limited to cross drilled units, I
would not use anything except the Porsche rotors where the holes are
cast in (hope that makes sense).  Windward claims to have the original
Turbo Cup units in stock, but even these still crack sooner than a normal
rotor.  Slotting is the way to go right now in my opinion.

If you are trying to reduce unsprung weight, then cross drilling is what
you'd want, if cleaning the pad and removing pad-rotor gases is what you
want, then slotting will work fine.

As a side note, when talking to OG Racing (a great guy BTW) recently, they
said the PF pads do not like slotting or drilling, just a nice smooth
surface.  The OG guys have been VERY good to me in the past, ordered lots
of stuff from them including a bunch of helmets.  Since everyone seems to
be running PF pads now, I'm going to make the switch and report the results.

On my future race car, it's AMM or CI rotors all the way!
