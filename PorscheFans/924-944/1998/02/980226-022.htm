Bill,

Quite frankly as I remember it, the 928 was not accepted as a true
Porsche. It was destined to replace the 911 and did not. From a sales
standpoint it did not do all that well.
The press did like it and I myself love ALL Porsches but lets face it.
The "Porschefans" of the era did not embrace it.
Please correct me if I am wrong, It happens now and than :)

How do you figure that?  Are you forgetting the 928?  By my
(possible flawed) recollection, the 944 was introduced in
late '82 as a '83 model.  The first 928s came out in late
'77 as a '78 model.  Are you suggesting that the 944 was
accepted as a true "Porsche" and the 928 was not?
