Years ago I did some professional vinyl and leather repair.  I would first
say that any product that is packaged for retail sale is garbage.  It will
not do want you want.  As to the repair of leather, it does not come out as
well as vinyl.  The reason being that the vinyl melts a little to form a
stronger bond.  If anyone wants to try to repair their own vinyl or
leather, here is what you need (available at automotive paint suppliers):

A heat gun that produces 600 - 800 degrees F.
Marhyde brand vinyl repair - $25 US
Marhyde brand vinyl dyes - $12 per 32 oz 
Small hobby trowel $5
A graining pad - a piece of vinyl with a similar grain to the damaged material
A method of applying the dye - an air brush works best $25
Iron-on patch material used for clothing

The most important thing to remember is that the repair will only be as
good as the material you are repairing.  If you leather or vinyl is hard
and has cracked open,  forget it.  The patch may last a couple of weeks but
will fail in a short time.  If you have good material that has been
punctured because you forgot a screwdriver in your pocket, you have a good
candidate for repair.

I've only worked with Marhyde products so I mention them by name.  There
may be others.

Obviously, the smaller the damage the better.  Anything over 3 inches is
questionable but can be done.  Dark colors are better than light with black
being the best.  Other colors will require custom mixing of different color
dyes to match the material to be fixed.  This can be difficult.  For a
beige color, white, black, brown, yellow and red dyes may be needed.  A
burgundy color might require red, blue, white, black and yellow.

Unless you have some of the equipment required, the expense of gathering it
may be prohibitive.

The steps to be taken:
1. Material to be repaired should be clean and dry.  Any residue of
silicone dressings will cause the patch or dye to fail.
2.Cut a piece of the iron-on patch that is about 15% larger then the damage. 
3. Insert the patch sticky side up into the tear and flatten it out.  It
should look smooth and not dip in.  Fill with some cotton   (cotton balls)
to bring up to level if necessary.
4.  Apply enough heat from the gun to activate the glue on the patch and
then press down with your graining pad.  You should get a good seal around
the perimeter of the repair.  This is your base for the repair and the
smoother it is the better the repair will look.
5. Apply a thin, smooth layer of the repair compound with the trowel to the
area within the tear, bringing the compound just over the edge.  Heat
evenly until the white compound turns clear and just begins to smoke.
Remove the heat and press gently with the grain pad.  The molten repair
compound with take the grain of the vinyl pad.
6. Repeat until the repaired area is level with the surrounding material.
No more than 3 -5 coats or less if the repair is very small.
7.  Mix dye to match and spray on the repair in thin coats until covered.
Watch the over-spray

I strongly suggest practicing before doing this on your Porsche as it took
me some time before I could make nearly invisible repairs.
