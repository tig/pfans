Greetings PFans,

	I just purchased my first Porsche, a Guards Red 1985.5 944, Monday
evening, and have been delaying this post as I've found myself out until
the very latest hours driving instead of home at my computer.

	As is inevitable, though, I've begun noticing many flaws that I could
swear didn't exist when I checked the car out Saturday.  Most of them very
minor little things, rattles and the like, but the two I'm finding most
annoying right now I'm hoping I can get some advise on.

	First, my speedometer.  Starting last night it has a habit of not working
until the car hits a good bump or some other sort of jolt.  Any thoughts?

	Second, my hatch does not seem to stay latched.  I'll make sure it's
securly closed, only to hear it start to rattle 2 miles down the road. 
More than once it's popped open jsut as I've pulled over to check it. 
Other times only the driver's side was unlatched.  I've adjusted the posts
in expermimentation so that they aren't putting any pressure on the hatch,
but it still continues to unlatch at times.  Somewhat related, the lock
release switch for the hatch usually takes 5 or 6 presses and wiggly before
it actually unlocks the hatch.

	I've been keeping a list of all the little things and hope to eliminate
every last one of them this weekend once I have some free time (might have
nothing better to do if the storms hit us again).

	I bought the car with high mileage (154k), but in otherwise excellent
shape.  Before purchasing, I did have a local Porsche shop insept it, with
no complaints other than rear suspension, but I would like to take it in
for a major service soon for a little piece of mind (it's not really due
for another 5,000).  Can anyone recommend a good mech in the South Bay area
of SoCal?  I'm not particularly fond of some of the staff at my local
dealer (Vasek Polak), but any suggestions are welcome.

Thnaks in advance,

						Matthew
