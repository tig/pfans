Hello all,

   I have been using AGIP synthetic in my car for quite a while now 
and have had nothing but positive results.

Smooth shifting in the coldest temps, crisper shifting, it seems like the 
syncros engage a little better with the synthetic.

I also have a question about paint codes and painting-
I am in the process of stripping down my 83 944 and am going to 
paint it. (it is moroon met.) I am some what handy with a paint gun
but have not yet upgraded to HVLP, and want to achieve the best finish
possible
I have heard good things about Glasurit, Sikkens, and PPG, but have
experience
only with PPG (the only thing available locally)
 I am going with a factory Porsche color, and am painting the whole car,
inside 
and out and was wondering-

1) Is there a web site that would list the Porsche paint codes, along with
a chip?
(I am looking for either a blue/silver or a brown/silver [Champagne])

2) Does anyone have experience with all three paints, knowing the benefits
and 
drawbacks of each?

Thanks again for all your help,

  Percy.
