Michael and pfolks,
I have been using Prestone Extended Life. It is labeled silicate and phos=
phate free. It is orange!
An interesting anecdote Before flushing the old coolant and putting in =
the Extended Life I had a couple of coolant leaks. One was at the drain =
cock the other I was never able to isolate but I think it was at a hose =
fitting.
It has been several months now and those leaks have gradually stopped. =
I haven't added coolant in several weeks. Before I was adding about a qua=
rt a week.
You can definately tell with this stuff if you have a leak. It leaves a =
orangy deposit around leaks.
