Indexing the torsion bars sounds really complicated.
So i have some more questions:
1.what ride height difference range can be adjusted with the
  eccentric bolt on the trailing arm?

+/- 11/16

2.What's the effective height difference if the torsion bar
  is indexed one teeth more? (Or by how many degrees will the
  trailing arm be rotated?)

Spline counts are 40 and 44.  Rotating inner spline CCW and outers CW yields
exactly (as close as I can measure) 1/8" change in height.

3.Do the bolts for camber and toe adjustment have a markable
  influence on the ride height? Shall we bring these also to
  a center position before adjusting the ride heihgt?

No.

>P.S.  Don't forget to take driver's weight into consideration.  Set the 
>car up for an even ride height with your weight in the driver's seat.

What about the fuel tank? I think a half full one would be the
best.

Use your track set-up for fuel.  If street only, 1/2 should be good.

Good Luck.  Email privately if you have other ?
