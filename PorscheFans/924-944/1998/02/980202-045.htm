I do not know the official factory setting, but 1200 RPMs does seem too high.

I think this is mostly on the earlier cars (pre-'85.5)

The rims could be bent, you could have warped rotors, or many other things....

Hmm, it is hard to say by your description.  There are only two fog lights
on every 951 I have seen.  It may look like there are two right next to
each other on each side, but this is just the lense design.  If so, the
lights sound fully functional.

I cannot help here...

Yes, the car will run right at 5 for the first 15 minutes or so.  Only then
when the engine is at idle it should go down to around 3 on the gauge.
This means you have reached a good warm running temperature, and that you
can now feel free to explore higher RPMs and more boost.

He should use 15-50 (unless you are in a much different climate.)

Could be.  Try this also.  Pop the hood up while it idles.  Rev the engine
from under the hod and then quickly release it.  If you here some loud
clakity-clack noise from the cam cover you are hearing your belts slap it.
This means you need new belts ASAP (improper tension).  Of course, you
should get new belts anyway unless they were done recently and that it is
documented....

Good luck,
