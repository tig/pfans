Hi Greg & P-Fans

	I guess I should have re-read my first post, Sorry. What I meant to say about
welding (MIG & GAS use) was that I have seen, and I still believe to be in
currant use, is that  using a torch for body panel repair is OK for cosmetic
repair. Like for smoothing out 1/4 panel seams or joints. But it is not OK for
stuctural repairs. 

	Thanks for correcting me Greg.
