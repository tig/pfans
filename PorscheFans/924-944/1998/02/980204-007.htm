John, I count myself one of the doubters.  It is certainly true that 
induction design has changed over the years a number of times to 
improve the quality of air mass metering.  Carb venturis have way to 
manifold pressure-based systems, which gave way to air mass-based 
systems.  Both the air flow meter and the hot-wire sensor fall into the 
latter category.

Measuring air mass is better than air volume, because you want to 
control the air/fuel mass ratio - that's what affects combustion, not 
volumes.  Interestingly, fuel injectors meter volume and not mass, and 
that's less than ideal.  This is why, for bleeding edge race 
applications, it is best to stick with one brand of fuel, whose 
specific gravity will not vary.

Having said all this, though, I have never seen anything quantitative 
and trustworthy that even begins to make me think that a hot-wire 
sensor is measurably better at measuring air mass than an air flow 
barndoor box.  Perhaps you can shed some light on this for me.

Kevin
