>==================================

I presume you are talking about an antenna built into the windshield, and
if so, there would be at least two connections to check on.

1)	a connection into the back of the stereo unit itself, usually
accessible by pulling the stereo out of its slot in the dash.

2)	at the bottom of the windshield, passenger side, accessible with
the engine hood up, there is a metal removable cover which conceals the
connector to the windshield (in case the windshield has to be replaced,
this is what is disconnected by the glass installer).

There may be some other connection behind/under the dash - kind of
difficult to determine when previous owners are involved.

Hope this helps some.
