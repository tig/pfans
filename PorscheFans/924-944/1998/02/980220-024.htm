First the first time in my 944, I tried using the heater last night.  I had
been on the road a good 30 minutes, so the car was quite warmed up.  The
temp control knob was turned as far clockwise as it would go, but the air
temp never changed from what it was with the temp knob at 0. Pretty much
outside air temp.

What could cause this?  I think I've pretty much ruled out a bad
thermostat, as it appears the A/C doesn't work either!  Although, the PO
did say he thought it needed to be recharged.  But when the A/C comes on,
should I be able to hear the magnetic clutch engage, or feel any power loss
if engine is under heavy load?

Thanks,

Matthew
