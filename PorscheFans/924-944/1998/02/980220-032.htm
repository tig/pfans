<<I just got thru yesterday's digest, and had to go thrash today's
archive a
bit too.  I was pretty suspicious about the early heel/toe descriptions
which didn't include the double clutching effort saving wear on the
syncros.  

But it sounds like the point is- heel/toe at the track w/o double
clutching
for a quick gear change that won't unbalance your car (since you are
presumably 'playing' near the limit of adhesion).

If you want to save your syncros though, you'd better double clutch
too.....  

Do I have my one brain cell on the proper wavelength? >>

Hi CG,

Sorry, you missed the boat. Go visit the Wizard of Oz for a bigger
brain. <g>

The whole point of having syncros is to eliminate the need for
double-clutching. Unless you are driving one of those big rigs when you
are not racing your P-car, forget about double clutching - those were
the "good ole days".
