This is in response to John Steczkowski's posting regarding auto-x'ing his
924S.  John, my experience has been on the track & street with my '87 924S,
but I think it pretty much applies.

1.  Koni sport front strut inserts are externally adjustable by way of a
plastic knob at the top of the shaft.  The rears must be unbolted to be
adjusted. (Good prices & service from Paragon Products) 

2.  The brakes should be very hard when properly bled.  I haven't changed the
flexible lines yet and my brakes are generally fine, just getting a bit soft
at high (track) temperatures.  I don't know what pads would be best for auto-
x, but I had good results with Metal Master pads (very inexpensive), and am
having great results now with Cool Carbons.  The Cool Carbons do need to have
some heat in them to hook up properly.

3.  Most 924S's came with a small diameter front sway bar, and no rear bar at
all, and exhibit lots of body roll.  A common and very effective upgrade is to
install the front and rear sway bars from a 944 Turbo or Turbo S, which are
available used at reasonable prices. (Talk to George at 944 Ecology)  It's a
simple bolt-on procedure, as long as you have all the pieces. 

These shock and sway bar upgrades will really make a significant difference.
It'll feel like a different car.

(I don't have any affiliation with the sources I've mentioned, I've just had
good experiences with them.)
