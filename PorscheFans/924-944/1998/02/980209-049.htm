<cjscott@lazerlink.com> so eloquently stated:

>Within the next six months, I want to buy a '86-'89 944 turbo.

Then start looking now as it could take this long to find a car that
hasn't been trashed.

>Does anyone have any information on the following:
>
>1) Average maintenance costs for 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989 944 turbo?

=46rom zip to the sky's the limit.  I believe this is one instance where
doing your homework and getting a great car initially could really pay =
off
in reduced maintenance.  My son paid a hefty price for his 951S but in =
the
18 months he has owned it the car has been 100% reliable.

>2) Top ten most expensive things to replace on a 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989 =
944 turbo?

1) Driver
2) Engine
3) Trans
4) Exhaust, especially on '86 if not updated.
5) Clutch, all years, high labor charge.
6) Turbo, rarely fails if you change the oil.

>3) Top ten least reliable parts on a 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989 944 turbo?

Don't know.  Nothing has failed yet, but I would suspect heater controls,
sunroof, clutch if abused.  Others probably have better idea.

>4) General information on a certain year to stay away from?

Any first year car such as the '86 turbo is more likely to have problems.
The later years had many changes and improvements, especially in the
exhaust and suspension.  On the other hand the '86 is the lightest and
cheapest so you might find a really nice car at a great price.  Worst
thing is the wheels on the '86 as these non-ABS cars had different wheel
offsets, making wheel upgrades harder.

>5) Any other (helpful) information/opinions on 944 Turbos would be =
greatly appreciated!!

These are great cars if properly maintained, and terrible cars if not.
Many 2nd, 3rd, or 4th owners didn't maintain them very well and as a
consequence there is a lot of trash on the roads.  Buyer beware!
