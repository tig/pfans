I am looking to try and find the "Official" Porsche color for the 1990 944
S2 that I just purchased.

The sticker that is next to the fuse box, in the engine compartment, has
faded beyond readability.  The sticker next to the spare tire, that should
also have the color code, is not there.  The warranty/maintenance manual
lists the color code as LM3U.

Another P-fans member said this is not a legitimate code.  Can anyone help?
I refer to the color as a "light maroon" but it is probably in the red
family.
