Well I finally got my car back together.  I put the K-27 DR, ported &
polished head and manifold to match.  The car started on the second try,
I couldn't believe it.  I haven't driven it much yet but it is smoking
quite a bit burning oil off and I may have a small coolant leak.  It is
dripping under the water pump but I can't see where it is coming from.
It has slowed considerably so maybe it is the overflow?  Also car is
only boosting to .6 bar(1.2 on Porsche gauge), I've had that problem
before and I know it can be hard to trace down.  The car feels very
strong to be boosting only .6 especially on the bottom end.

I did not replace my timing belts yet as I didn't feel totally
comfortable doing that and I was tired of working on the car.  I'm going
to let my mechanic trace the boost and antifreeze problem when he
installs my clutch.  I'm just thrilled to have it running so I can drive
it to my mechanic.

The PowerHaus K-27 DR turbo adapter did not work very well.  The only
way I could get everything back together was with a bind in my
hoses-airbox fittings.  I tried modifying the adapter three or four
different times and could not get it to fit correctly.  I'm going to
call PowerHaus Monday and see if I've done something wrong, I hate it
when things don't fit exactly right.

It really did feel great driving my 944 again, I really like the car
better than my C4 993.  I will give an update when I get the car running
right,(1.5 bar boost) and new chips.  Also I would like to thank all who
came to my aid on several different occasions, the help was greatly
appreciated.

Randall Morton
