I own two 924s (82 924 & 80 931) so obviously I like em for what I want
to do. Play and tinker. Having said that. It aint a collector car. In
general I dont think ANY 924 should be over about $3000 to MAYBE $4000.
Including the turbo (931). Usually much less, half those amounts or even
less. The 944s of 83/84 vintage are around for that, so why pay more for
the earlier version? I have seen some very nice very clean 924S for
$5500 to $6500.

To echo a thread that was on the site just a few day back about the
944s. These cars were purchased new at pretty rediculous prices. It
becomes almost impossible for an average original or early owner to sell
it at market. Kind of like my wife is every time we have sold a house.
