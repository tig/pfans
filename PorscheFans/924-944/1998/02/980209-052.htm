Hello All,
          I have an 87 951, upon investigating the motor 
mounts it looks like the passenger side is bad. I purchased
the car about 2+ years ago with 60k miles. The driver side is
still the old style. My question is did any model year come
with the updated mount but only on one side. The mount has
colapsed about 1/2 inch. and is very brittle. I received my 
parts today and will replace this weekend. I almost got 
caught in the change belts,rollers and water pump syndrome. 
While I was looking at the mounts tonight I noticed that 
there was coolant leaking. It turned out to be the upper
hose clamp was loose. I just changed the belts and rollers 
and adjusted. Only time will tell. Thanks for all the help.

David 951 87burg
