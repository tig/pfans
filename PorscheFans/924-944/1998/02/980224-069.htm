I know what you mean, yesterday on my 10 mile drive home I had 3
close-calls with people planing, making sudden oversteers out of puddles
(ie, small lakes), etc..  As for SoCal salvage yards, I only know of one.
Aase Brothers in Anahiem keeps a good stock of salvaged German autos,
mostly Pcars. (714) 956-2419 or (800) 444-7444.  They're on Cyrpess St if
you're familiar with the area.  Unfortuantely I can't remember where on
Cypress.

There is also another salvage yard in the SanFran area that has almost
everything and will do mail order quite reasonable.  Used to be Porsheaven,
not PartsHeaven I believe.  Don't have a phone number handy, but they do
have a webpage if you want to search for it.
