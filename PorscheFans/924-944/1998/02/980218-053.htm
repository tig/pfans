John - My feet are 11 1/2's and it works great for me. you do need =
supple shoes though. I have one pair of dress shoes that give me fits =
while heal toeing. My personal favorite are well broken in boat shoes =
(dock siders whatever you want to call them). Although it seems odd =
sneakers are not too good. They have too much traction and you actually =
need to have some slipping because of the different motions of the two =
pedals.=20
The top racers are small so they don't impact the power to weight ration =
as much as us 'bigfoots'!!! Remember that even for us 100 lbs light for =
driver and car is like getting 4% more horsepower and 4% bigger brakes =
and 4% sticker tires. If you factor that down to a 1200 lb formula car =
you are close to a 10% disadvantage.

>I'm curious to ask, Farzan, what size are your feet. I'm pretty =
coordinated
but I wear a size 12 and when I try heel and toeing I end up hanging up =
my
feet as there isnt much clearance under there. I have a pair of hiking
boots I cant even drive the car with. I've noticed that most of the top
race car drivers are fairly small people, now I think I know why.
