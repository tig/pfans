Hello Pfans!

After 1 year of looking (4 months serious) I finally bought my first   
Porsche.
I have been on the list for a year, and at first I was a little taken   
aback at all
the problems people were reporting.  But, if you factor in the sheer   
number
of list members (1600 or so) there aren't that many problems as first   
seem.
Also, the quality of the advice is fantastic.  Like everyone else, I love   
this list.

Anyway, upon driving my 86 951 111,000 miles back to Dayton, OH from   
Connecticut
I had the opportunity to test the acceleration a bit.  On the interstate   
at about 75 MPH a BMW 328is blew by me and I put my foot in it a little   
to catch up.  The boost kicked in <big grin> and at 2 bar and about 90 or   
100 MPH it shut down completely, no boost.
After I let the pedal off, normal operation continued.  So, I ask, what   
causes this safety measure to kick in.  I experimented a little and it   
doesn't happen in the lower gears, only 5th gear, 90 MPH.

Thanks again, especially to Steve Timmins, Marv DeBeque, Alan Whiteside,   
Clark Fletcher, and the guy kind enough to sell me his 951!

Pictures soon on my website!
