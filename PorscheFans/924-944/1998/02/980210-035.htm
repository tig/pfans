> Within the next six months, I want to buy a '86-'89 944 turbo.

Good plan to start gathering info now.

> 1) Average maintenance costs for 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989 944 turbo?

I don't think the year of the car really matters. The 86's do
have some problems with exhaust manifolds, and the brakes and control
arms are a little different, but that's the only real difference.
The 89 is a turboS, so they cost more, but have more power.

I don't drive my car often enough to get a real good idea on yearly
maintenance. I do track is a lot, so my maintenance is done a lot
more often than a daily driver kind of car.

> 3) Top ten least reliable parts on a 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989 944 turbo?

Things that are likely to go wrong (and check the FAQ for the complete
list, but don't let it scare you) are:
1. clutch 	$500 part	$2000 for a shop to do
2. motormounts	$150 parts	?$500 for a shop
3. waterpump	$100 part	$1000 for a shop
4. control arm	$150 each (rebuilt)	no idea
5. sunroof		no idea
6. steering rack	no idea
7. oil seals	$100 parts	?$500 shop
8. Transaxle	big bucks	bug bucks
9. Engine (bearings)	bigger bucks
10. everything else

> 4) General information on a certain year to stay away from?

The 86 was the first year of the 951. People have difference opinions
of these. Some people say to stay away because the 86's have bad exhaust
manifolds, different offset wheels, different brake rotors, and potential
fuel line problems. Others say that Porsche took extra care building the
86's so they are better cars, and they're a little lighter.

In 87, you could get ABS and dual airbags. 

In 88 you could get the turbo S. That had more HP (250 vs 220) better 
brakes, a stiffer suspension, better wheels, and a luxury interior 
(better sounds system, cuise control etc. standard).

The 89 is the same as the 88 turbo S. 

> 5) Any other (helpful) information/opinions on 944 Turbos would be greatly appreciated!!

Yeah, good luck! These are great cars if you get a good one. If you don't,
you'll curse it every day.
