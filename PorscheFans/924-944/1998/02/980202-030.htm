Two questions for the wise ones:

1. I ordered a fog-lamp lens from Auto Atlanta and got exactly that -- a
piece of glass. For some reason I thought this would be a bolt-on piece,
but apparently I need to rip the remnants of the old lens off the frame
and glue the new one on. I have never glued glass, what does one use to
glue glass to plastic with a good watertight seal?

2. This weekend I had the pleasure of accidentally opening up the
Air-Flow Meter cover while trying to get at an air-hose. While I had it
open I cleaned up, repositioned the rheostat arms to sweep a new part of
the resistor, cleaned terminals etc. Now what do you seal the AFM with?
Looks like clear RTV on the seams now. I plan to take a hair-dryer to it
to get rid of all moisture and then seal it up. The person who had
posted this procedure on the list, please let me know what you used to
seal the cover. This thing was surgically clean when I opened up (after
14 years) so I want to make sure it stays that way. TIA.
