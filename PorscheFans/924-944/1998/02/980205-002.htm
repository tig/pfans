Patrick,

I have sold my 87 944 about 9 months ago, but still have my 87 944S.  
Having seat time in both models and both being in outstanding running 
condition, I can make a few observations.

First, if low end torque is your goal, then you would be very 
disappointed with the 944S.  The king of the hill in that domain would 
befall the 968.  Perhaps, the 928 should be mentioned, but if you have a 
desire to stay with the four cylinder, water cooled, Porsche camp, then 
the 968 is the undisputed winner, followed closely by the crowning of the 
944S2.

Ganguly is correct about the 16 valve head supporting extra breathing 
beyond the middle rpm ranges, however, I am confused about his 
description of final drive ratios.  The 944, if I have the term correct, 
is geared taller than the 944S.  That is, if you match speeds, and gears 
(i.e., 5th gears) with the two cars, you will see a higher rpm on the 
944S than the 944.

This was done to better fit the torque and horse power curves of the 
944S.  The 944S's erogenous zone is squarely planted above 4,000 rpm and 
the car is set up to be driven there.  Off the line, the 944S seems 
lethargic, but not such as the Turbo.  However, once above 4,000 rpm, the 
944S is very playful and the engine feels light and agile, spinning up to 
the rev limiter freely under load.

The extra 40 horses are not as sharply defined as one might expect.  This 
is due to the character difference from the lower final drive ratio and 
the peaky 16 valve power plant.  The car is alive when driven in the play 
zone and exalts in a different feel than the 8 valve sibling.  When the 8 
valve engine is flattening out, the 16 valve engine is coming on.  The 
944S was clearly meant, from the onset, to be a car driven in a spirited 
fashion, where as the 8 valve engine attempts to appeal to a wider 
audience over a broad range of driving conditions.

On the back roads, the 944S is a blast in tight twisties when the engine 
is lit up.  On the highway, the car has noticeably better acceleration 
(again, when on the pipe) to and beyond 80 mph.  It is just easier to 
cruise at higher speeds, however, once settled into a cruising speed, you 
keep reaching for a sixth gear which isn't there.  On the highway my 944 
Turbo is much better.  In fact, I can match the same speed and rpm of the 
944S in 5th gear with the Turbo in 4th gear!

The 944S is a great car.  It is spirited, playful, and rewarding to drive 
at its limits, but not the low end torque monster you wanted.
