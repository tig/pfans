Hello Fans,

When I bought BFG Comp T/As at NTB, I had them
do a 4 wheel alignment to the tune of $100.  I don't
know if they've done 944s prior to mine (they said they
did) because it took them 3 hours (I believe it was
because the bolts were hard to break).  In-fact, I had
them take me back to work while they continued to
work on it.  The result was awesome!  The car was
smooth up to 90 (didn't want to push my luck with
speeding).  Prior to the alignment, I could tell I was
going 65 without looking at the speedo by the
shimming in the steering wheel.  The point is for $100
(NTB's standard is $50) the alignment was dead on. 
Personally, dealerships are the last places I would
take my cars simply because of their labor charges. 
Its a misconception, I believe, that they know more
about their product than an independent shop or a
place like NTB.

My $.02 worth!
