I have talked to a few people about gearbox changes for the Turbo and Turbo S.
The ring and pinion change is very expensive for what you end up with.  I have
been on the track with several cars that have had this change, and they aren't
appreciably faster because of it.  If you are going to have the box serviced
anyway, then maybe it could make sense, depending upon your overall goals
(e.g, particular tracks your run, bracket racing, et, cetera).

A change to the Turbo S box is very nice for cars that don't have an LSD or an
oil cooler, that see some AX and track time.  The Turbo S boxes can be had
used for as little as $1200 if you shop hard.

I wouldn't believe Powerhaus or others who claim that the 951 and/or 951s box
can't handle a certain amount of bhp.  I would believe the real racers: Jeff
Chandler (JCM) in Colorado, the Stone brothers at Kelly Moss Racing or Jon
Milledge.

I have spoken with Jeff Stone at KMR and some folks at a shop out East (I
believe it was Dougherty) that have specific experience with the 968 box
fitted to a Turbo S.  I'd talk to them about this if I were interested. (I
almost got involved in an experiement to try a special Tilton clutch with a
968 box and optical pick-up system that KMR was interested in).
