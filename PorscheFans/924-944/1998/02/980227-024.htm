<<I have the ability to cross drill the brake rotors on my car (87 951) 
using CNC machining equipment at work.  Does anyone out there have any 
information regarding the preferable size of the holes and their 
location?  Once I know the size and locations, drilling the holes is 
trivial.  Also, any tips as to where I might find this information 
would be appreciated.

If anyone has put cross drilled rotors on a 951, have you experienced 
any stress/heat cracking or other types of failures?  The car is a 
daily driver, but will eventually find its way to the track.  Thanks 
in advance.>>

Hi Mike,

The conventional wisdom says don't do it unless you own a rotor
manufacturing plant. Cross drilled rotors will crack and fail much
sooner. You can accomplish the same thing by slotting the rotors or
pads. Another alternative would be to modify your brakes to use the
993tt or 968 M030 'drilled' rotors which are actually cast holes...
