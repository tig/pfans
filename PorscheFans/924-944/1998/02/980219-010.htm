>Am I missing something here?  If the clutch is IN all the time during =
the
downshift, there is no way you will be able to downshift with no synchro
action.  The transmission will still have to speed-up the input shaft =
for
proper gear meshing.  The only way to downshift without syncro action is
to double clutch, i.e., release the clutch as you downshift while =
passing
through neutral.  THEN you blip the throttle appropriately to bring the
trans input shaft up to speed.  Then you put the clutch IN again and
finish the shift.  Admittedly, this is a lot more work and harder to do.
Since I have not driven my car on the track yet, maybe it's not =
necessary
to do it that way, but it's the only way that makes sense to me.<

You are 100% correct! If you want to downshift with no syncro action you =
need to 'double declutch'. (at least thats what I know it as) Using the =
heel toe methods described in the earlier postings you use the syncros =
to bring the drive shaft up to the transmission RPM. The rev matching =
that the driver is attempting to accomplish takes place at the flywheel =
/ clutch interface.
BTW - Just to split hairs - the other way to downshift (or upshift) with =
out using the syncros is to rev match and shift with out using the =
clutch. As mentioned earlier this is tough to do perfectly and errors =
can result in $$damage$$. This is actually quite common in purpose built =
race cars that use transmissions affectionately called 'crash boxes'.
