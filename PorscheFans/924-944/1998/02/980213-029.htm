P-Folks,

Relying on a gut feeling, I did tow my 944 in for a belt job.  I was
glad I did.  I just picked up my '84 944 from the mechanic yesterday.  I
had the belts (slick except for the teeth), tensioners (one frozen, one
loose), waterpump and thermostat replaced.  I felt real good about it.
The mechanic told me the PO had not set one of the balance shafts
correctly and that a lot of the vibration I was experiencing would be
gone.  He was right.  I drove the car to school that afternoon and then
home.  A good 300 mile drive.  Today when I drove, I was a little to
heavy on the acceleration and missed a shift.  I, too, have seen the
redline, but it was not as plesant an experience as Dennis had.  Now, my
beautiful machine has a louder lifter "tick" and a deeper knock in the
bowels.  Would all you experienced p-car fans tell me what I have done
and how best I can fix it.  I shudder at your responses!

TIA,

Bill Catchings
