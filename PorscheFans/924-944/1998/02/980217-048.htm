Just to be sure i try to tell you all what i think i know now. Please 
correct me if i'm wrong and/or forgot parts:

a) The CylinderHead is made for higher compression (10.9:1) and the air 
intakes (tunnels) are larger than on the plain 150HP-Cylinderhead.

b) the exaust system is completly like to 944Turbo system.

c) the DME is differnet (setup is different) than on 944 150HP Engines. 

I just wanna talk about the engine, not the rest (which is really nice 
;) 

Please help me out getting more information about the differences 
between these two engine's.

Daniel
