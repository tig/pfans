You are correct in assuming that the WR7 is a hotter plug than the WR5.
The initial reasons I went with the WR7 were simple... it is standard
equipment on the 968 and my dealer had them in stock.

At first I was a bit concerned about the heat range since the normal plug
called out for the S2 is the WR5DC.  BUT... reading the manual, the WR7DC
is also listed... and if you read the fine print in the tech bulletin
concerning the use of these plugs, you will see that all S2s delivered
after August 1990 came with the WR7DC plugs (which is also the standard
plug for all turbos).  The advantage of the WR7DC is it comes up to
operating temp faster and is much better suited for cars that make =
shorter
trips or get driven infrequently.  My car doesn't really fall into this
category, but since the plugs were listed as being interchangeable I felt
it was a no-brainer to make the switch.  Glad I did!
