I need help....
about five days ago, while I was driving, I experienced sudden power loss,
it lasted only a split second so I dismissed it as water in the intake for a
second (since I live in LA  and everythings been flooded lateley). It
happened again the next day, but hasn't happened since. In addition, I have
been experiencing, upon cold starts in the morning, that after I back up,
the idle drops and the car almost stalls, it bounces up and down for a
couple seconds and then stabilizes back at 1k. The worst symptoms have just
started in the last few days though, two days ago, the car wouldn't start
after I had driven it (so the engine was warm), I got out, moved some plug
wires around, got back in (slammed the door) and the car started. I didn't
experience any problems for the rest of the day, and then last night, I went
to the store, and when I came out, the car wouldn't start, I did the same
thing with the wires and got back in, still wouldn't start, I got back out
did it again, got in and slammed the door, and it started. Then when I left
the parking lot, I was waiting at a light, and the car stalled at idle. It
restarted though w/o a problem. Now today, I took the distributor cap off to
check for possible moisture in the system, and after I put everything back
on, I took the car around the block, and it stalled while I was
accelerating. I pulled off and tried starting it, it wouldn't start, then I
tried again and it started.
If anyone has any ideas please send them to me ASAP, I'm suspect my problem
is somewhere in the ignition system, or with the fuel injectors or pressure
regulator or something.
TIA
