For those interested there is a German specialty place up the street that 
has had an 86 Turbo for some time.  I stop in occasionally hoping that they 
want to give it away but....   They are asking $9200.  As I recall it has 
67K miles, is black with a linen interior and I was really taken with the 
fit of all the body panels, everything fits very well and it does not look 
like it has ever needed any body work.  Generally, it looks like it has 
been well cared for.  They don't have all records and it will need tires. 
 The car is North of Atlanta GA. All disclaimers apply, I don't benefit in 
any way from the sale nor do I make any material representation about the 
cars ultimate condition.
