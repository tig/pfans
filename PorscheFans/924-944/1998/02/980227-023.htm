Raminder,
There is one more thing to check before tackling the T-stat. 
I have found it is possible to gat a vapor lock in the cooling
system that prevents the system from cooling properly.
symptoms are: soft hoses, High temp, cool radiator.
It works like this: The engine temp goes up, and cunducts
heat to the radiator but doesn't flow water through it
hence the soft hoses.  When the fans do kick in it only
cools the water in the radiator at the time since no coolant
is flowing through it.  Rest easy that your pump is still working
if it wasn't you wouldn't be able to cool the engine with the
heater core:-)  I would try Bleeding the cooling system from the
bleeder plug.  It is described prety well in the Haynes manual.
If it doesn't help the t-stat isn't too bad if your patient. But
I imagine the bleeding will help.
NOTE: when bleeding if steam is coming from the bleeder plug try
helping the pump by squeezing the top hose once and a while.
And have someone watch the temp guage, it climbs fast!!
Good Luck,
-Nick Miller
