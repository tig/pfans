Jeff, I took my car out of storage about 3 weeks ago.  I could not stand it 
any more as the weather has been exceptionally good here in Southwest 
Ontario (Chatham).  I remember last year on the Feb.  14, 15, 16th long 
weekend was when I had go to Pennsylvania  to see the car and buy it.  On 
the way back, I was stuck in a snow storm outside TO.  

Any way... happy driving.
