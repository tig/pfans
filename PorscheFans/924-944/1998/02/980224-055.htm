     I am planning on replacing my plugs this weekend and want to try these 
     new Bosch tri-electrodes.  As I remember the plug that was being used 
     (by Tom?) is the WR5DTC or the FR5DTC.  Is this correct?  Brumos (the 
     local dealer) said the correct plug is the WR7DTC.  The car is used as 
     a daily driver so would 7 be the proper temp range?  Mine is a 
     normally aspirated 8 valver.  Out of curiousity are these available 
     from anywhere except the dealership?  I checked a couple of parts 
     places last weekend and nobody knew what I was talking about though 
     they all tried to sell my Bosch Platnum plugs or NGK copper.  One 
     place finally found the number in their Bosch book and just said 
     "that's for a Porsche and only the dealer would have those and they'll 
     cost four times as much!"
     
     Thanks,
