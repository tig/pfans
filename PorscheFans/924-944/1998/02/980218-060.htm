Fellow P-Fans
After buying new hood struts for my 951, I attempted to install them. Of
course nothing is as easy as it seems, at least for me. I sucessfully remove
the old strut from the passengers side and put the new one on. Easy enough I
thought. I moved over to the drivers side, I yanked and pried at the bottom
joint and pop it came loose. Allright!, I almost have the task completed. I
look down and the ball joint came out with the old  strut, now there was no
way to connect the new strut at the lower mounting point. In my search for a
replacement part, I stumbled into the local John Deere dealership and was able
to find a suitable replacement. A little guards red paint on it and it will be
a Porsche part.I have the JD part no. if anyone needs it. You never know where
you will find a part for your Porsche!
Hope to see some of you at Steamboat Springs!
