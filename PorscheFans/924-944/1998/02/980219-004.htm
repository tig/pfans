Jeff,

Make sure you check prices carefully.  I took for granted the Porsche
dealer was going to be way more expensive than independent dealers.  I
bought most of my stuff at Automobile Atlanta but they actually weren't
much help with the update pieces.  They even gave me a few wrong rollers.
Then some wrong parts got back ordered so I went to the Porsche dealer.
One roller that AA charged $66 for was $24 at the dealer.  Also, make sure
you get the update kit for the pump and the seal kit.  The update kit
should have a belt guide, larger roller that replaces the smallest smooth
roller at the top, and a template to cutout the rear cover.  

A note on the rear timing belt cover.  I saw a new rear cover and, bare
with me on the description, the entire bottom section that rests against
the pump was cut out.  That is exactly how I cut mine.  

A note on removing the pump.  Don't just start cracking bolts loose on the
pump (like i did).  Some of the bolts actually go into the water jacket and
could be corroded.  One of my bolts snapped and it turned a 5 hour job into
a 2 day job (well that and all the wrong parts from AA).  I actually had to
drill, tap, and helicoil one of the bolts on the lower right side.  Talk
about being scared.  Lucky for me I have a ton of experience with helicoils.  

Also, when reinstalling the pump, I had several list members tell me they
thought the torque specs were a little light.  I can't remember what they
are but I thought the same thing and gave them a couple of extra in-lbs.
Lastly, there is a big debate on using gasket sealer.  Most were split on
whether or not to use it.  I did use it because the last thing I wanted to
do was to have to tear the front end of the engine back down because of a
leak.

One tool that may come in handy is the one that holds the balance shaft
pulleys.  I bought one from Automotion for reinstallation because using 2
punches and vise grips sucked.  I was fortunate another list member who
lives in the Atlanta area was nice enough to lend me the tension tool.

Good luck, take your time, and don't forget to breath when you crank the
engine for the first time.  I think I checked and recheck the belt time 100
times before turning over the engine.
