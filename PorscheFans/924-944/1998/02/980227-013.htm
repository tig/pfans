I think it might be a good idea to add a little to this section.

13.4 Ignition wires are HOW MUCH!? What's so special about Porsche wire?

After about 4 hours of searching I found that the original porsche wires
(OEM) were not manufactured by porsche.  Although I did not get the
exact company name the manufactured them, you can purchase them from:

Vertex
(305)-442-2727
http://www.web2000.net/waa/vertex/specials.htm.

for $79 [ 944 '83-88 944-T].

The OEM ignition wires are 15 year old 7mm "carbon core" wires.  A
better deal (in my opinion) would be the "magnacore" 8 1/2mm Ultra High
Efficiency Plug Wire Kit available from:

windward performance products
(802)-387-4500
http://www.windward-perf.com/

for $69.

These wires have new technology that should allow them to last longer.
>From what i hear the carbon core wires are prone to have the core crack
after a while.  Also check out Bosche tri-electrode spark plug ($4.99
each) form windward performance.

NOTE:  To purchase an OEM carbon core set through porsche was over
$200.  These are certaintly being marked way up, and there is NOTHING
better about them.
