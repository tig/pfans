1991 944 CAB with 56Kmiles.  Here are my concerns, which aren't many

The rear deck seal (trunk) is broken, and there is 5 inches of water in the
truck area tire well.  If that isn't enough, it is "leaking" out to the
ground.  The seal I can fix, but the fact that the water leaks out, is this an
even more item of concern.

They had a custom radio in it; when they pulled it out, the replacement has
one volume, too loud.  This is probabl a no-rainer.

The top is power (guessing this is normal), with "manual" release of the top.

Haven't yet done a leak/compression test.  What should it look like to be
acceptable.  

And I one time had a 924, which was ok.... but this 944 gives me "heat".  Any
particular concerns for a 91 944 cab.... since I'm new to this conference
(spending my tie in the 911 instead ... sorry)

My problem, I have a 82 911 cab that I'm looking atnd this 91 944 CAB, both
about the same price (more or less).  So I'm looking for some help, knowing
the decision is mine, but would love some help....
