Jeanette,

Yes, I am quite aware of the restricter. You have a turbo and it would make a
big difference. The primary reason for the restricter is to balance vacuum for
the distributor advance/retard. For the US models, it also makes the fuel
enrichment curve a little different for the CIS airflow sensor plate. Being
this is based on vacuum draw against the plate, a restricter can affect the
enrichment curve.

We removed it to get more airflow after enrichening the mixture and changing
the advance curves of our 1977 924s. This was over 20 years ago. I don't
mention it much anymore because there are few people interested in doing this
to a 924 anymore. BTW, the 1980-82 924 normal with the lambda does not need
this removed as the lambda system and frequency valve do an excellent job of
maintaining balance and those engines have 10 more real horsepower over the
1977.5 to early 1980 924.

Your turbo is a 1979-80 which has a primary/secondary venturi. The 1981/82 931
does not but the throttle plate and fuel management system is very different
from yours.

Just as a hint, we also used to rig the secondary to open a bit sooner for
better throttle response. No more HP, but it seemed to feelbetter while
autocrossing. They use to throw the 924 into the improved class in
autocrossing which meant I had to run against 356 Speedsters. I could beat
them on the faster courses, even giving them a 700 pound advantage.
