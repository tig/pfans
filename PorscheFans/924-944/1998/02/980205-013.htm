Well.. I finally got my shock and struts in.  Boges, cause I simply
couldn't affortd the upgrade to Konis.  My 83 944 haas 101k miles on
her.  I grabbed my buddy who opened up his shop (with a lift! Wahoo!!)
and we tore into my baby.

My option codes on the car did not show performance shocks.. but when I
started to pull the shocks off the back, and scraped the grime and
roadscum off of them.. they were YELLOW!  I had been told by several
folks that meant Konis... and sure enough, they were Konis - with
Porsche part numbers.

The Boges fit.. and I had to decide whether or not to try and pull the
struts.  After all, I had been told that Koni cartridges wouldn't fit
into Boge struts.  Two beers and a pizza later, we had the struts off.
Opening them.. yep, yellow Koni cartridges.  I almost cried.  But to my
surprise, the Boges fit into the struts just fine.  

My question?  What's the deal here?  I mean, I'm glad they worked and
all... but did the guys at the dealer and at Zims simply not know what
they were talking about?
