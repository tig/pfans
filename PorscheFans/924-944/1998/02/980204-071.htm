My 85.5 does this a bit too.  Not only at 70, but anytime I'm really
putting my foot in it.  I submit that when pushing that much exhaust
through the system, you're getting a leak from that crack in your
exhaust manifold and it's coming through your ventilation into the
cabin.  Anyway, mine has a crack on the manifold that I haven't gotten
around to fixing yet, and I attribute the foot on the floor exhaust
smell to that.  Sound reasonable?
