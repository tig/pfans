Does the car really need nothing? I think belts are probably a replacement
item due to the age. Steering rack seals? Engine gaskets starting to weep?
Cam, balance shaft and crank seals?

I think it safe to assume that after being driven so little in 9 years some
of these items are reasonable concerns and could be used to reduce the asking
