<<Mike,

You raise some valid points.  For me, the big interest in the 6-speed
conversion is that the shorter gearing results (theoretically) in faster
acceleration AND improved throttle response, yet doesn't place any
additional strain on the car.  Also, unlike a ring & pinion only
conversion, the sixth gear keeps the car livable on the freeway.   I
already have Autothority stage II chips and hesitate to add anything
else to the engine that will shorten its life.  Although my engine is
very strong (1% leakdown), it does have 85k miles on it and the thought
of adding a bigger turbo, going crazy with boost, or something else
along those lines makes me a little nervous -- broken 951 motors cause
serious and unforeseen hardships to bank accounts.  

I guess the big question that you raise concerns the price to
performance ratio.  In other words, how much added performance (both
outright acceleration and drivability) do you gain for the dollar
investment required?  Your $2500-$3500 estimate on cost is the first I
have associated with this subject.  Has anyone else come across a price
for this conversion?  A few days ago someone posted info on a SW program
that, as I recall, allows you to change certain performance related
variables of a car and then it outputs an estimated change in the
vehicle's performance.  If that software allows you to change gear
ratios, it would be interesting to see how big an improvement is
predicted by switching from the 951's 5-speed to the 968's 6-speed.

Interesting.  Recall that I have two 951 cars.  One is an '89 with the Auto
Thority stage 2 set-up.. It makes 0.9 - 1 bar of boost (1.9 - 2.0 on the
gauge).  This car has 33,00 miles, and is a pristine concours winner.  The
other car is an '87 with 93,000 miles.  It has the K26/#8 turbo, just like a
Turbo S or an '89 (remember, the larger hot side creates more, not less lag).
It has custom designed chips (Milledge) and runs 1.1 - 1.2 bar of boost (a lot
of boost-- must be careful with the gas and gas pedal).  This car is very
fast.  The strange thing is, it is torquey even at the low end.  And the
throttle response is spectacular.  Even my co-driver/wife/sponsor can tell the
difference!  We have managable power and torque, even for AX!  This is not
true of the '89/Auto Thority car.  It is no fun to AX.

Of course, one question is "would the '87/Milledge-chipped car be as fun in a
straight line with less boost-- say 1 bar."  The answer is yes.  Milledge
generally suggests less boost for a street car.  Another question might be
"aren't you stressing the engine a lot with the Milledge high boost set-up?"
The answer is yes and no.  We have had this car for two years and done about
15-20 two day, two driver track days.  That's a lot of hours.  I use a 50-50
mix of race/street gas for the track only.  We have also done about 40 two-
driver AX events in the same period.  Street gas (max boost generally cannot
be achieved in AX).  Plus about 8000 miles on the street each year.

So far, the head gasket has blown once, and it went from old age at 80,00
miles.  When I pulled out the rod bearings, they were scuffed just a little
bit.

So my point is, you can get there with engine management changes which are
much cheaper than a gearbox change, and are fairly reliable.  You must take
care of your car.  Preventive maintenance is absolutley key.

As an aside, a friend with an '89/Auto Thority car has had his head gasket go
twice in the same period with about 1/2 of the hard driving hours!  I know of
at least one professional engine builder who has a data base of head gasket
failures corresponding to the different Auto Thority software revisions.

I do not want to slam Auto Thority-- they and the Weltmesiter (actually Dinan)
people make excellent products for the masses.  My point (again) is that you
can get to a more enjoyable level of "drivability" with engine management.

Plus, what about the suspension?  How many people are running around out there
in 951s without the proper alignment as suggested by the experts?  A proper
alignment (just beyond the "specs") plus some slight changes to the suspension
can actually transform a 944 or 951.  I have experienced this myself, and have
witnessed the change in others as they've pulled the car off of the alignement
rack.

To me, the gearbox is amongst the least cost-effective areas to change, except
for a true expert DIY person or a competitive racer.
