            My mechanic got his in the end.
            I have been pretty satisfied with my non-Porsche mechanic but=
 he did "scare" me into replacing a leaking rear main seal just after I =
bought the car.
           When he got in there he found a busted up clutch disc. Yeah =
it cost me a little more but it tied up his shop for 2 weeks and he didn'=
t have the nerve to charge me what it was worth.
            Thanks to this list I know more now and he won't "hose" me =
again.
