     I'm new to the 944 world, and although I love to work on cars I'm no 
     great mechanic.  That being said, here is my problem:  I drive to work 
     in stop and go traffic, and spend a lot of time idling.  The car will 
     now not idle in the morning.  I crank the car and it's fine, drive a 
     few miles and the car will not idle smoothly at all to the point of 
     stalling if I do not rev the engine.  The engine knocks as if all 
     cylinders are not firing and hesitates when accelerating to 2,000 rpm. 
      If I hold the motor at 2k or above, the motor does not hesitate, all 
     cylinders fire, and the car does not stall.  Obviously, it is 
     unacceptable to have a car that will not idle!  The problem has 
     gradually gotten worse, to the point that it was an occasional "knock" 
     as if all cylinders were not firing which was cured by revving the 
     engine, to today the car could not idle at 1k or it would stall.  When 
     the problem occurred previously on two other occasions, the car idled 
     perfectly on the way home after work!    
     
     It has been suggested that the coil be replaced as output was less 
     than it should be and I was planning to do that along with replacing 
     the spark plugs this week.  Could this cause this problem?  It doesn't 
     seem the likely culprit to me.  Any advice on where to start?  
     
     As always thanks in advance for all help,
