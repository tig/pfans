I know nothing about the Super 4.  I was under the impression though from
comments on this list that the tri-electrode Bosch plugs usually work
better (provide better output) than the normal (single electrode) plugs
partly because they do not require indexing,.  I wonder if the Super 4 is
the next evolutionary step. 

This is not by any means meant as a flame.

Hello P-Fans

=09I think we are all getting carried away with this three/four tipped sp=
ark=0Aplug talk. Remember you don=92t get something for nothing! It doesn=
=92t matter if=0Aa spark plug has 1/2/3/4/or what ever number of electrod=
es! We do have the=0Alaws of physics here to deal with. The energy can on=
ly travel from center=0Aelectrode to ONE of the outer electrodes!!! The r=
eason most late model cars=0Ause these plugs is because: the plugs have t=
o last 100K (US federal emmision=0Awarranty) miles, 3 or 4 electrodes hav=
e more surface area for the spark/flame=0Ato wear over time.
=09I think what people feel when they replace their plugs with new plugs =
(wether=0Abe it 2/3/4 electrodes, splitfire or Bosch) is the performance =
gain of =93just=94=0Aplain =93new=94 spark plugs! That=92s all! 
=09Personally I have found the three electrode plugs to have a rough idle=
 and to=0Abe prone to carbon flakes to get stuck in one of the electrodes=
, causing a=0Adrivabilty problem. Since the coil energy will only travel =
to one of the three=0Aouter electrodes, one of the unused electrodes tend=
 to get a small piece of=0Acarbon stuck into it. The shop I work in found=
 out that by replacing the=0Athree-electrode spark plugs with a single el=
ectrode variety always solves this=0Aproblem. We like using Bosch Silver =
plugs, like WR7DS (S stands for Silver). I=0Ahave also heard that Silver =
Stone plugs are good. 

=09BTW, have you heard that Bosch filled a law suit against Split-fire a =
few=0Ayears ago? Remember the Split-fire adds, show TWO electrodes being =
fired from=0Athe center of the plug to the outer electrode, seems that is=
 physically=0Aimpossible. They ended up settling out of court, Bosch won!=
 Now the Split-fire=0Aadds only show ONE energy zap!

Good Luck
