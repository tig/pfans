On the subject of a summer meeting - is anybody going to be at this year's
parade in Steamboat Springs?  We could arrange to meet if enough of us are
going to be there. Hell, I would be happy to meet even if there was just
one other Pfan there.  I do not know Steamboat Springs, so I cannot suggest
a venue.  (A few years ago, a bunch of us -"Porschephiles"- met in Portland
during the parade and spent a very pleasant time together.)
Any interest in a repeat performance?

Second question: Any knowledge of reasonably priced accommodation at
Steamboat Springs.  I hate spending a bazilion dollars just to crash on a
bed, especially since it is not expensible. Clean, safe and serviceable are
my requirements.

Third question:  I have not yet received my January Pano.  Mine usually
arrives at the end of the month.  Were your's late in arriving this time
around?

I will be happy to start a list of possible "meeters" until the details are
finalized.
