Question, Jeff.......are you referring to the oil pressure sending unit
for your oil pressure gauge? Sometime recently, I think it was in the
944 faq that informed me that if you insert your ignition key and the
oil pressure gauge pegs out at max, then the sending unit was bad. I
replaced it and that did the trick. Can't believe that it was the exact
same symptom! You can get to it underneath the right front side of the
car.......if you're skinny like me, probably you can slide under the
front apron/spoiler w/out jacking up the car. First slide the rubber
weather boots for the terminals. I had to wipe away the oil and grime
(mixed w/ road sand) buildup before doing anything first. Using small
sockets on a 1/4 in drive, I took the retaining nuts and washers off,
put them away safely from the work area (things have a habit of
wandering off when I work!!!), then using a crescent wrench or if you
have the right sized open-end spanner, remove the sender unit. Expect a
little bit of oil to drip out so have either a drip container or a rag
handy to catch the falling oil. Replace w/ the new one and reconnect the
terminals. Oh, by the way.........just in case you don't know where it's
at, the sender unit is on the same assembly housing of the built-in oil
cooler where the oil filter screws onto. This is on a normally aspirated
engine. If you're on a turbo, I'm not familiar of the location and then
my directions would be way off. I think the turbo engine would have an
external oil cooler. 951 owners, help me out on this one,
please......don't want to be passing bad info. I hope this may be of
some help......
