Well P-Fans

The 968 came with H4s from the factory as well as H1 and H3 driving and fog 
lights respectively.  I have upgraded the wattage somewhat however.  The 
H4s are 130/100, the H1s are 130 and the H3 are 100 watt.  Since they are 
all relay switched from the factory and all fused individually, the only 
thing I did was increase the size of the fuse.  Now when you hit the high 
beams and they and the driving lights come on, its like driving at noon on 
a sunny day.  I have yet to have an issue with any of Minnesota's finest 
(at least regarding the headlights!) The 968 is wired from the factory that 
when you select the high beams the driving lights automatically come on. 
 No way to disable this other than to remove the fuse for the driving 
lights.  This is the best lighting I have ever had in a car.

Hello P-Fans
	I actually bought a set of Hella H-4's before I bought my 944! I would 
highly
recommend installing "euro" headlights into any car (that has those US DOT
sealed headlights) driven in North America. The bulb pattern is far 
superior
to the US DOT sealed headlights!
	At first I simply used 55/60 watt bulbs with no other relays or mods to 
the
electrical system. I did upgrade the fuses from 7.5 amp (OEM stock) to 10 
amp
fuses though.
	About a year latter I upgraded to 55/100 watt bulbs with 30 amp relays.
Before I installed the relay kit, just for fun I measured the voltage
available at the back of the headlight connector. To my surprise I only had
10.2 volts, instead of the 12.8 volts available at the battery. As the cars
wiring ages, the resistance of the wires increases and less and less 
battery
voltage gets to the headlights. I would highly recommend to use a relay kit
EVEN if you do not have higher output bulbs!

Has anyone on the list convert the light to H4 bulbs.

Part 13YV9317U Price 16.95 55/??? watt
Part 88YV9556X Price 18.95  80/100 watt

If so, do you need to change anything else.
