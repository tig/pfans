Guten Tag,
 All right Y'all I have a question for ya.
Im finally going to do it: a solo belt change!  I have read the Haynes Manual
and kept most of the 
notes Ive seen fly by here on the list that had to do with the change.  My only
problem is how
do I use my super-duper(lets not forget damn expensive) tension tool?  Is it
supposed to come
with any directions?  Anyway,  I figured Ive "blueprinted" two engines V8s, 
This shouldn't scare me too much. If I could get the following advice:
1: how do I use the tension tool/ calib spring?
2: With all the talk, what is a good tension for the new belts?
3: Why am I so nervous about it?
4: Any phone numbers out there in case I get in a bind?(or chew all my finger
nails off)

I also open an invitation to anyone near Lafayette, Indiana. as I will be
moving soon to a 
new home with a bigger garage I will have plenty of space to keep my SUN
Diagnostic mach.
where I can pull right in and hook'er up.  If anybody close would like to have
an emissions
check, true tach reading, ignition analysis(primary, and secandary). Or hell
just drop by to chat:-) drop me a line.

Thanks for any advice you can spare,
laters,
-Nick
