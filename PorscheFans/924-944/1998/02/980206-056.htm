<< Given that here on Maui it is close to impossible to find a place (with a
 reasonable degree of safety) to get up to 120 mph, much less hold that
 speed, I'm wondering if it might be a wise choice to put the next rating
 down (120 mph) tires on the rear of the car. Save a little money, maybe get
 better tire mileage, and maybe with a little less stickiness on the rear
 even out the steering characteristics. >>

Sorry about the double reply.  If you want to go with the lower speed rated
tires, why don't you go with the lower speed rated tires on all four corners,
but the same size tires on all four corners.   This would drop the price even
more.  also, It just hit me that by putting different compound tires front to
back, you may end up with different breakaway points front  to back.  Meaning
theres a point where the tire starts to slide, and a point where it goes, the
amount of time you have in between those points may end up being different
front to back.  If this is the case, could it lead to unpredictable handling?
