     I had a chance to drive a 1993 968 and compare it to my 1986 951
yesterday.  The 968 has 40k miles and my 951 129k miles as of this weekend.
I like the 968, I like it a lot, but it certainly doesn't have the kick you
in the
pants kind of feel the 951 has.  The suspension on the 968 felt more
precise,
maybe because it has 90k miles less time on it than mine, and the car felt,
"smaller".  Part of this might be the difference in the front end look.  It
doesn't
seem as wide when you are in the driver's seat.  Low end torque on the
968 seems a lot better than on my 951.  The car feels like it wants to
really
move off the line, while my 951 likes to be coaxed.  I could get a much
better launch with the 968.  Lastly, the six-speed gearbox in the 968 is
wonderful.
The clutch feels much the same as in my car, but lever action feels much
more precise,
and the car seems happier in spiining up from low revs in any gear.  The
only
thing I miss is the rush that shoves you back in your seat when you punch
the Turbo above 3k rpm.  I'd really like to race the 968 and stock 951
against
each other from a rolling start at 40mph.
     I grew up with Star Trek and Battlestar Galactica, so forgive this
comparison,
but the 951 reminds me a lot of a Colonial Viper, and the 968 like some
kind
of small Star Fleet ship with warp drive.  You know the Federation
technology
is better and will last longer, but the Viper really gives you a thrill
when the Turbos
kick in.
     I think my 951 needs suspension work and a tune-up.
     Anyway, I think I'll keep my 951.  I know where the bugs are, I only
owe about 4k
on the car at this point, and the paint is much prettier.  However, the 968
is for sale, mechanically
sound, the dealership is going to fix the paint before it is sold, and I
think for $22k you would have
a really nice piece.  I can get more info on the 968 if anyone is
interested.
