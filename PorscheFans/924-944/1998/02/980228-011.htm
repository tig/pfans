Hi, Lenny,

Actually, there was a long thread on K&N filters some time back.

This is not meant to be a flame to new PorscheFans members, but a lot of
recent questions are on things that have been discussed over and over
again on this list.  It would save everyone a lot of time and effort if
the new members would consider doing what I did.  When I first joined
the list about two years ago, I started going through the archive every
day until I had read every post to the 924-944 list.  That brought me up
to speed with the rest of the members and the posts that I thought may
be useful later, I saved to my hard drive.  The archive is there for a
reason and you would be hard pressed to find another source of
information where you could learn so much in such a short period of
time.

Again, this is not a flame, but merely a suggestion that I think would
benefit everyone, especially the new members.
