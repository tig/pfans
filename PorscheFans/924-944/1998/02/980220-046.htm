I'd assume both taillights connected up, but only one actually
has a bulb in it?

What style bulb is used?

The Haynes manual seems to be completely wrong when it comes
to rear fogs.  In my car the wire doesn't seem to be in the
harness at all (perhaps they used a different wiring harness
for US spec cars?)  And they show the side markers connected
wrong.

Also, if it works as you say, why would the Haynes manual
show seperate switches for front and rear fogs?  The manual
must also be wrong here as well.  I assume the blank switch
area is used for the European driving lights (on Turbo and
S).

Well they do qualify the diagram as 'typical'...
