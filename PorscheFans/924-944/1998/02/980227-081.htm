Pfans:

Just some info on a cruise control fix.=A0 My CC was very erratic; didn't=
 hold
speed, would speed up and then drop all together.=A0 First I took apart the
servo unit in the engine compartment and cleaned up the track areas and
reassembled - no change.

Finally I got around to taking the control unit out to inspect it.=A0 For=
 the
early 85's the unit is located behind the radio, close to the firewall and
comes out from the drivers side.=A0 Just pry the connector off, then it is
secured via two screws and a trim piece needs to be removed to get to the=
 unit.

I took the pc board out of the box and it looked brand new.=A0 I cleaned the
entire board and connector plate.=A0 I noticed a small crack about 1/8 inch
from the top of the board and it ran from one side to the other. I bent the
entire board back slightly hoping to compensate for this.

Put it all back and it actually works.=A0 It holds speed (even low ones)
without a problem (so far). Needless to say it might be worthwhile to check
your out if you have similar problems.=A0I used a radio shack product called
"Electronic Cleaner" part #64-4327, but I assume any cleaner such as Blue
Shower should work.

Thanks to Ben McDaniel for putting it up.=A0=A0
