"... Stills can easilly be pulled from
the video at a later time and compiled in whatever format we see fit."

I also would rather see a good video of a repair procedure than a couple
of photos. You'll want to get some good lighting under the car so the
video will look good. But if you eventually will want some photos, I'd
use a 35-mm camera to get some high-quality shots.

I do a lot of work with video and photos, and I have learned that
getting a good still shot from video is more difficult than it sounds.
Close-up video shots work better than long shots for making photos, but
still the photo usually looks very grainy. Then there is the matter of
getting a good print made. If you capture the video frame with a
computer, the graphic will be a low-resolution file. Commercial printers
want high-res graphics to produce good color photos. If you print it on
a color laser printer, you'll lose some detail and it will be very
contrasty. If you use the graphic on the web, it might be OK, but in all
cases a photo shot with a good camera will be far more useful.
