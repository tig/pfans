=0A=0A=0A=0A=0AHello Bill & P-fans,=0A=0A=09Sometimes when a engine is no=
t started for a few days (like when it is in a=0Arepair shop) the engine=
=92s lifters will go tick-tick-tick, for awhile. Check=0Athe engine oil l=
evel, and just drive the car for a few miles. The lifter noise=0Ashould g=
o away after a few miles/days. =0A=09Usually this is a tale-tale that the=
 engines oil has not been change all that=0Afrequently! Sluge and varnish=
 tends to build up in the cylinder head lifters=0Adue to long oil change =
interval(s).  When left to harden for a couple of days=0A(weeks) the nois=
e occours because the lifters can not pump up and pump out the=0Asluge in=
side of the lifter(s). =0A=0A=09Try driving the car for awhile. Of course=
 there is always the ATF solution. =0A=0AGood Luck, Davidjalai@aol.com=0A=

 up my '84 944 from the mechanic yesterday.  I=0Ahad the belts (slick exc=

 the car to school that afternoon and then=0Ahome.  A good 300 mile drive=
