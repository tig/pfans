I agree that for the street, it's not necessary to heel toe your downshifts.
Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't, it depends on the corner, and my mood.
On the autocross course, and DEFINATELY on the track, you HAVE to heel toe 
for good lap times.

Note that heel toe has NOTHING to do with engine braking, and EVERYTHING
to do with matching the speed of the engine to the speed of the rear
wheels when downshifting. 

If you don't rev the engine when you let out the clutch after
downshifting, the rear wheels will do it for you. When on the track
(either autocross or race track) this is bad because you typically have
the rear wheels right at the edge of traction. Letting the clutch out
(without matching engine speed with throttle) will unsettle the rear
wheels, and may cause them to lock up. That will force you to reduce
braking until they start to roll again. This will cost time, and that's
what you're trying to save. Racing is all about balance, and heel toe
downshifts result in the most balanced downshifts there are.

Folks, please don't try this on your syncromesh equipped Porsche (or is
it Audi?) transaxle. The syncro's will not like you. If you have a 
crash box, then give it a try. Again, the reason racers shift without
the clutch is that it's faster. There are lots of stories about racers
such as Vic Elford telling the Porsche engineers to build non synromesh
transmissions for racing, but Porsche's response was 'we sell syncromesh
trans, so we race syncromesh trans'. Or something like that.

Agreed!
