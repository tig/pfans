What to look for when choosing a body shop to have paint work done.  Th=
ese
aren't  always the case but general rules.  I have been in little dirty=
 shops
that produce great results and been in clean, big shops that turn out p=
oor
results.

1.  On German cars (all cars really), Sikkens or Glasuruit (spell) pain=
t is
used and are sprayted by  painters who are trained in how to use it.
2.  Even though I work here, shops that use the 3M Paint Refinishing sy=
stem are
the higher end shops.  Many shops now use this system so this isn't the=
 best
indicator.  These are the shops who are paying quite a bit more for the=

refinishing products and are the most concerned about the finish the cu=
stomer
sees.
3.  Quality shops usually work on the higher end cars.  Check out the c=
ars in
the parking lot and see what is parked in front.
4.  Quality shops guarantee their paint work for the life of the automo=
bile.
If you are ever dissatisfied with anything regarding the work done on t=
he car,
they will fix it.  This is always in writing on the contract.  Low qual=
ity
shops will not even offer a contract.
5.  .Any shop that will not guarantee a perfect paint color match, don'=
t walk
away, run.  With today's technology, a perfect match is almost a certai=
nty
unless you have a pearl paint job.  White, black and red are the hardes=
t colors
to match.
6.  If you have a metallic color, ask the painter how he/she controls f=
lop of
the flakes.  If they give you a blank stare, this is not good.
7.  Ask what the final step is on the paint before it is returned to yo=
u.  The
last step should use 3M Perfect-It Foam Pad Polishing Glaze with the fo=
am Pad
(then the car will be washed).
8.  Good shops have a downdraft paint booth.  This significantly reduce=
s the
amount of dust nibs and other junk that gets on the paint during sprayi=
ng.  Ask
what kind of lights are in the booth.  There are special lights that mi=
mic the
spectral output of the sun.  This ensures correct color match when outd=
oors.
Be aware that to perfectly match paint under all types of lighting situ=
ations
is impossible.  The color will look somewhat different under fluorescen=
t lights
(at a gas station at night for example) then it will look during the da=
y in the
bright sun.  The effect is called metamerism
9.  Good paint shops, as a rule of thumb, are generally clean.  You pro=
bably
will not be able to eat off of the floors (although I have been in some=
 shops
where you can), but it generally it is a good sign.
10.  MAACO's Imperial Special isn't.
11.  Earl Schweib's special $199.00 dollar job is worst than MAACO.
12.  In good shops you won't be compelled to ask the question if they a=
re going
to replace, vs repair, damaged body panels.
13.  High end shops usually have nice clean reception areas.
14.  Poor quality shops do not stay in business long.  Ask how long the=
 shop
you are at has been in business.

Other things to consider:

1.  Call a local automotive distributor (one who distributes the above =
listed
paints), and ask their opinion as to the best shop..  If you are having=

mechanical work vs. body work, one shop may not do both well.  They may=

specialize in one or the other.  Ask this distributor if the recommende=
d shop
pays their bills on time (this is a big indicator of quality shops that=
 have
few customer problems).
2  Call you local Benz, BMW, Porsche, Audi dealer and ask where they ha=
ve their
work done.
3.  Find out who the Sikkens or Glasuruit sales rep is from the paint
distributor and ask them who, in their opinion, are the best three shop=
s in
their territory.  You can do the same with the local 3M rep.  These guy=
s visit
many shops every day and know which ones are the best.  Visit all 3 of =
the
shops recommended.
4.  Talk to local rodders and ask where their work is done.  These guys=
 are
usually paying over $5,000 for a paint job so their demands may be diff=
erent
than yours.
5.  Ask you Porsche Club members, they all know where to go.

If I have offended anyone on the P-fans list, I am sorry.  I have been =
in a few
hundred shops in my days and generally this is the case.
