Hi all,
I have heard a few things about the G-tech/Pro on this mailing list and
have been looking into buying one (for those of you not familiar with
this device, it is an accelerometer based, automotive performance meter
that plugs into the cigarette lighter and measures:0 -60 & 1/4 times,
G-Force, Braking and Horsepower)
Today on the BMW Digest, I noticed a post that explained how Tesla
Electronics is giving BMW CCA members a group discount on the
G-Tech/Pro.  I spoke with Jovo Majstorovic (the owner of the company) to
see if we could get a similar deal for P-Fans.  He said that if at least
12 people from this list agree to buy a unit this month, we'll receive a
$20 discount on each unit.  This means we pay $119.95 + $10
shipping/handling.

If you want to take advantage of this and buy the G-tech, let me know.
I will compile the names and, if we have enough firm commitments ,pass
them on to Jovo.  You may then order directly from Tesla at the $119.95
rate.  If you want more info on the product, check out their Web site at
http://www.gtechpro.com

BTW anyone who saw the BMW Digest post will notice that our discount is
only $20 as opposed to their $30 discount.  Jovo told me that the $30
post was in error and that he is only offering them the standard $20
group rate discount.  So we are getting the same deal.
