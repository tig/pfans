I did a conversion to the Autopal H4 halogen headlamps. They, as most H4
headlamps i.e.-- Bosch, Hella, etc., are a direct replacement and fit
right in the standard tungsten 7" sealed beam headlight pods. Just pull
off the rubber boot cover from the retractable headlight motor inside
the engine bay and rotate the knob until the lights are fully elevated.
Using a phillips screwdriver, remove the two screws that hold the
headlight door (the black plastic panel that surrounds the headlight
when the headlights are elevated), pull the headlight door off, and
remove the smaller screws holding the chrome trim ring that the
headlight fits into. The H4 bulbs are a direct plug in, no mods needed.
Afterwards, just reverse your removal steps.

The Autopal H4 headlamps are a wee bit different, however, in the aspect
that it contains the very small pilot lamp within the reflector bowl.
This lamp is wired up to the parking/side lamps so that when the
headlamps are elevated but the headlights are extinguished, the small
lamp softly glows in the reflector bowl. This gives the car an authentic
European look.....like the H4 European headlamps used in the
Mercedes-Benz. If it wasn't for this parking lamp feature, I'd go
straight over to the Bosch H4 lamps.

Oh, by the way, the Autopal H4 headlamps are found in the Auto Atlanta
924-944 catalog w/ the black cover (the older one) on page 108 near the
back cover. They have it listed for $20 for the pair. Please keep in
mind that the package comes w/ two headlamps itself, two H4 55/60w bulbs
(don't touch them w/ your bare hands; I blew mine up that way!!!), two
rubber weather boots to fit over the back of the H4 bulbs, and the two
small parking pilot lamps. Not a bad bargain compared to the higher
priced Bosch or Hella conversions.

One last thing, the FHP (Florida Highway Patrol) never gave me any flack
for utilizing H4s on my 944. It's probably because of that new clause in
which the DOT now allows the European or Rest of the World type of
headlamp lens fluting versus the American lens fluting. In case some
people haven't noticed that the newer cars like the Toyotas, Hondas,
Mercedes-Benz that are imported now have the European lens type fluting
on the American market cars but they utilize a different bulb instead of
the H4 bulb. If you notice, when the H4 bulbs are in low beam, they
illuminate only the upper half of the reflector bowl and, depending on
how your country's traffic pattern is set -- right hand side or left
hand side driven on the road, the bulb allows a bit more spread of light
to utilize that little extra cut out lens to illuminate the road without
blinding oncoming traffic. The bulbs that are used in the American
version illuminates the entire reflector bowl when in low beam. I have
no idea why they did this. Good example is the headlights the 911s use.
There are the H4 and then they have the H5 American styled lens w/ the
H5 bulbs. Now, the question is this: if they are now allowing the
European type lens into the American market but use different bulbs, why
are the H4 aftermarket lamps still say "For off road use only"? Probably
because the usage of the H4 bulbs in itself is the reason why. But heck,
like Nike says, "Just do it". You'll like the new profile your car will
have as well as how less fatigued you'll be driving at night.

Hope I've "shed some light" on this topic for you!!
