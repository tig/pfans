be extremely careful as simple green will eat the paint off the car 
not to mention many other items...it is a very harsh detergent and if 
you use it straight it will eat the motor oil and every thing 
else...my roomate thought it would be a good idea to use it on his 
corvettes motor as recommended by someone on his list...he now has an 
LT-4 (Grand sport motor) with no paint on the valve covers, ate right 
through it....before you go to simple green try an engine 
degreaser..a little worse for the environment but much better for the 
car...just make sure you get it all off and that the one you get is 
safe for aluminum....
