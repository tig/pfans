Hi, folks.  Only six more week until the beginning of track season at Lime
Rock!  On a more immediate topic, can anyone help me with a slight problem
concerning a-arm bushings?  I'm replacing my a-arm bushings with solid
Weltmeister bushings (thanks, Jason @ Paragon) and am stuck trying to remove
the original bushings from my steel a-arms.  The rear bushings have a steel
sleeve through which the rear pivot shaft runs, and they're frozen up solid.
I went so far as to cut all the rubber off one of them and thoroughly heat it
with a propane torch, but even then I could barely turn it with a pipe wrench.
Bad for the shaft surface.  Nothing I've read suggests these are installed
with a press,  but I'm beginning to think I'll need to have them pressed out.
Any ideas?  While we're on the topic, does anyone have any tips on how to
remove the rubber bushings and steel sleeves from the front pivots?  Any help
would be much appreciated.  Thanks.
Matt Brady
