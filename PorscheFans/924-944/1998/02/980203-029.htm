Except it cost just under $25,000...


While I previously blabbered:

I gave my earlier sold-for price based on what the dealer (World Auto 
of Bellevue, WA) had told me even after the car was already sold to 
Jeff.
So not only did they lie to me while I was working with them on a 
price-agreement, but even after they had already pocketed the money 
from the sale.
The lesson to be learned (again) by everybody is that you can't trust 
any used-car dealer, no matter how nice they may initially appear.
