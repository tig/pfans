=0AHello P-Fans=0A=09Here is what I found to be the culprit for my fuel o=
dors on my 951. =0A=0A=09Pull out the trumk carpet, there is a round blac=
k cover that covers the fuel=0Alevel sensor. The sensor has a rubber gask=
et that with age will disintegrate=0Ainto the gas tank. I noticed this wh=
en I was replacing my sensor. I simply=0Aused a square audio-sound proofi=
ng tile with a self adhesive backing. This=0Atook care of my in car gas o=
dors. On my car I would notice the odors more with=0Aa full tank. =0A=09A=
lso the carbon canister system can cause odors. The vent line hoes from t=
he=0Agas tank, under the left side of the car up to just right of the bel=
l housing,=0Aover the rear of the firewall and over to the left (drivers)=
 fender. Inside=0Athe drivers fender lies the carbon canister. The carbon=
 canister has a 3/4=94=0Afiber hose that can leak or the hose clamps can =
work themselves loose. Make=0Asure all of the lines are tight and not dam=
age due to runing over something.=0AAlso from the carbon canister (inside=
 the drivers rear fender area) to the=0Aunderside of the drivers floor ar=
ea (where those plastic covers are under the=0Abody), their is another ho=
se about a 2 ft long to vent the fumes under the=0Acar. Porsche acme out =
with a bulletin to shorten this hose to six inches to=0Aprevent iceing ov=
er and causing gas odors.=0A=09Check all of those fuel lines under the ho=
od. Make sure the foward hose has a=0Adouble crimp on the fuel rail to pr=
event hose failures. Remove the rubber=0Ainsulation on each fuel feed/ret=
urn hose. Sometimes the hoses can start to=0Aleak and the outer hose cove=
rs the leak.=0A=0AGood Luck=0ADavidjalai@aol.com=0A=0A=0A----------------=

>=0A=0ASubject: Strong Fuel Smell=0A=0AHello!=0A=0AI got my 1987 951 out =
of winter hibernation yesterday and went for a =3D=0Anice, long drive.  I=
t was great!!  This morning, however, I stuck my =3D=0Ahead inside the ca=
r and noticed a fairly strong smell of gas.  I know =3D=0Athat there have=
 been postings about this in the past but I was not =3D=0Aaffected so I d=
idn't pay much attention to the replies.  Can someone =3D=0Aplease give m=
e some clues for where to start my fuel odor source search?=0A=0AThanks!=
