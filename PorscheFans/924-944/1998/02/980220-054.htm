This is a little off the Porsche topic but...

OK, I will be happy to race your M5 with my Quattro on my next ski trip
with four people and skis inside the car (no rack required) through fresh
snow to the ski run.  Have fun with your chains!  Actually the BMW is a
great car, but for me was way too big to be fun.  The Audi has all of the
practicality of SUV's (which I HATE but that is another story-rolled
4runner), while still having character.  Last Christmas going up to Tahoe
during a blizzard a BMW and I were having fun through the twisties in the
foothills where it was raining, granted he had the advantage, but then we
hit snow.  I was then able to play with the 4x4 trucks in the snow, no
competition there.  Never saw the beemer again and as long as I stay on the
road, the trucks have no chance.  I have also seen two Beemers lose it in
the rain by my house, driver error of course, but quattro would have
prevented the situation.

I am of course biased toward the AWD advantages as both the Porsche and
Audi have it, even though I live in San Diego and don't NEED it except for
ski trips in the Audi. I still feel Porsche + Audi is the best combo!  To
each his own.
