Raminder: congratulations on your purchase!

The standard 93degree fan switch on your car will allow the gauge to
climb to just short of red before starting the cooling fans. If you live
anyplace but Alaska you may want to get a lower temp fan switch, to
start the fans at half-gauge or lower (87degree or 85degree). If you
have the factory fan switch you probably have the factory t-stat as
well. Highway driving at any temperature should keep your 944 cool, so
you need to get a lower temp thermostat that will start the cooling
cycle earlier than it is starting now. The fact that stop and go traffic
is keeping your 944 cooler than the highway implies that your cooling
fans are doing all the work, which is not ideal. The idea is to start
the cooling system as soon as your motor has reached an efficient
operating temp, and then use the cooling fans for short periods only
when the cooling system cannot cope or does not have enough air-flow
through the radiator for heat dissipation.

I think I have an 80 degree thermostat and an 87 degree fan switch and
highway driving keeps my temp gauge to the first slash, even in 80
degree summers. My fans come on at half or 3/4 temp gauge, and the
engine cools down very fast after they have triggered, but ideally I
would like the temp gauge to never read more than half, so I will get a
lower temp fan switch in the future.

You don't really need to worry about the temp gauge until you see red!
It is nice to have a cooler running 944 esp. when you need the A/C in
stop and go traffic, but you are not damaging anything at 2/3 gauge. The
fans have their own mind and seem to operate differently in different
years of the 944, and with different versions of the fan switch. Both
the fans on my car start up at the same time, and the A/C triggers them
both as well. The only time one fan works, is when I turn the ignition
off and the car is still hot. Bottom line: if both your fans work to
bring the temp down fast, and your temp gauge is out of the red, don't
worry about the fan cycles.

Check that you used a phosphate-free coolant. 50/50 is fine.

If you are losing very little coolant over time, try a new expansion
tank cap. They get old and stop holding 15 psi and you will see
mysterious, slow leaks. If you still lose coolant, have the system
pressure tested. You don't want a bad water pump going unnoticed.

On a more general note, if your car has miles in whole multiples of
30,000 on the odometer, and no records of a recent timing belt and water
pump r/r, you should get this done ASAP. Good luck.
