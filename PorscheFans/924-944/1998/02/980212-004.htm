I couldn't find a knock sensor for the 88 (or 89) 944 in the 
wiring diagram of the factory service manual.  I am guessing
that the diagram applies to your car, since the engine type 
was the same for all 88 944s worldwide, except for Australia.
I apologize for giving you incorrect information earlier.

I did find two knock sensors on the 944S, and of course, one
on the turbo.  A photo in the manual shows the 944S knock sensors 
mounted between intake runners 1/2 and 3/4 next to the fuel rail.

My first guess would be carbon deposits, but I've never had the 
opportunity to diagnose such a problem on a 944, so I wouldn't
know for certain.
