Ill give you some input on adding a Bursch test pipe and cat-back to a late
'85 944, plus a K&N flat filter in the air box.  Keep in mind that this was
done above 7000 ft, so performance is down on a normally aspirated engine. 
The Bursch cat-back alone is about 10-15 dB louder, and adding the test
pipe didn't increase the noise level that much. I'd guess the combo of the
stock cat-back and test pipe adds about 10 dB.  I let someone test drive
it, and it was pleasant to hear the engine rev thru the gears, but it gets
to be a pain on a long highway trip. On the other hand, I just sold the
cat-back, and the new owner loves it.  I have a cone filter on my
Pathfinder (don't as me why) and it makes quite a bit of noise, but not
unpleasant. 

As far as performance, comparing a late '85 with a Turbo S is apples and
oranges, but I didn't notice much difference with all 3 components in
place. My main goal was to get some pull in 5th above 115 mph, and it
didn't.  Regarding the cone filter, do you really think that the stock
induction system is that restrictive? Try one run with no filter at all (on
a day when the air's really clean).
