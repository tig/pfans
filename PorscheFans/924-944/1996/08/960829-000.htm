Karl:

I own all three of the cars that have been mentioned in this thread
(a Porsche -- a hotrod 914/6 in my case -- an MR2-Turbo, and an
NSX), and while you're right about the Porsche being the only "raw"
car of the group, the NSX isn't really "soulless"... It DOES have a
personality; it just takes a while before you notice it.

The 914 has the same personality as the mid-engined Ferraris that
Luigi Chinetti, Jr., desribed thusly:

    "They're not friendly.  They don't say, 'Let's go for a ride.'
    They holler, "Hey! Wanna go for a ride?  Me, too!  Let's see who
    wins.'"

The NSX and the MR2-T, on the other hand, ARE friendly.  Maybe I'm
getting old -- I hit the big Three-Oh this month -- but I enjoy
driving the NSX more than the Porsche.

The Porsche's more FUN to drive than the NSX -- as you say, it has
that raw Teutonic feel -- but it's also much more demanding; it's
nowhere near as effortlessly fast and smooth.

It's that easy smoothness that hides the NSX's personality.  I mean,
until you're near its performance limit, EVERY car feels pretty much
the same... And the NSX has extraordinarily high limits.

Once you get up there, though, the car really does have a very
responsive, tactile feel... High-speed handling is absolutely superb
and the engine starts to feel REALLY good above 5000 RPM.

If I had to anthropomorphize the two cars, I'd say that the NSX is
like a publicly-reserved-but-privately-lusty wife, and the Porsche 
reminds me of the psychotic nympho girlfriend that I DIDN'T marry.

P.S.  By the way, the MR2 does have one thing that the other two
      cars can't even touch:  Absolutely the best factory stereo
      that I've heard in ANY car.
