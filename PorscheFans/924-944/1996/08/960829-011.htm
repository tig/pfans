The injectors usually make a clicking noise as they open/close.  It is a very
noticeable noise.  My '84 944's injectors were louder than my '89 951.

This isn't that unusual.  My older car made the noise, my newer one has had the
tranny recently redone.

My '84 944 had hood insulation.  Nasty stuff, slowly fell apart into the
engine.  My '89 951 doesn't have it, it may have been removed.
