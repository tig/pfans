Hello Phello PorscheFans,
	Sorry to hear about your transmission Pete, what year is your 
car?  You are lucky for it to last 150K, mine only lasted 82K on my 
former '88 944!  I was very happy to find a limited slip 944S tranny for 
$600 from a guy who was parting out his whole car.  I've heard that all 
parts, especially used are hard to find/expensive in Germany.  
	As for making it home, the best of luck!  When mine broke it was 
totally immobile.  Not to mention I was on a date with one of the best 
looking girls in my college.  She laughed as I pushed the car in the rain 
and mud back to a parking lot.  Now that I look back on it it was kinda 
funny.  Best of luck...

Jay Karolyi
