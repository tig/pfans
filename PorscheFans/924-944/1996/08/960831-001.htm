<< As I said in previous posts, I was going to investigate some power
upgrades
 for this car.  My race teammate in the Talon just bought a monster turbo
 and larger injectors for his car.  This mod usually nets 1/4 mile MPH
 of 115-120mph and ET's of 11.30 - 11.90!  I know I won't touch him in
 the ET department with the AWD, but I would like to at least bring
 the Porsche up to 110-115mph on pump gas.  Once again, I am not a drag
 racer, but I do use drag racing as a guide on how much power the car
 is making.
 
 To achieve this level of performance, I have laid out the following goals.
 I want 300hp at the rear wheels and approx. 350hp at the flywheel.  I know
 the transmission can't take much more than 375hp so this should be right
 in the comfort zone.

Farzaan, 
I, too, am amused by your posts because you are going down a road that has
been much traveled and I know what is going to happen. It is nice to have
performance goals but you had best have budget goals also. It is not too
difficult to get the kind of performance you wish. What is difficult is
keeping it all together. You are building an expensive grenade. A 951 engine,
putting out 350 BHP is going to eat head gaskets like potato chips not to
mention rod bearings. You can probably get away for it on the street for
awhile but certainly not on the track, where you are under sustained full
throttle situations. 
The reason is that under the pressures you are talking about the head will
stretch the head studs enough that the gasket will have a short life. In the
US you will not get much change from your $1000 bill for a head gasket job.
You can fix this a bit if you replace the head studs with Raceware Products
and replace the head gasket with the "Wide Fire Ring" number. This is the
route most guys that I race with in the PCA Race Series take on their
modified engines.
The next problem area is the #2 rod bearing. When this goes, and it will, you
will be looking for a new crank as well if you are lucky. Now we are talking
lots of thousands of $$'s. You are using Mobil 1 aren't you?
If you are building a race engine, and you are, then be prepared to do race
car maintenance. Just be realistic. The cheapest part of your project is
achieving your performance goals. The expensive part is making it reliable. I
hope you have a very healthy maintenance budget. You can build a reliable car
if you keep the flywheel horsepower at about 300HP. At 350 you are have an
expensive cash flow machine IMHO.
BTW you got rid of the hot set up for track wheels. 8.5" x 17" and 10" x 17"
on the back is the way to go. That way you use 255 x 17's on the front and
275 x 17's on the back. 
Good Luck!!
