I do have the budget to some extent.

Ok then, my past post actually had the rear wheel HP at 260hp.  I wanted
300hp, but it's quite a leap and like you said, many shops don't want
to sell that much HP, until the block and head are upgraded.  How
does 260hp at the rear wheels sound for reliability?

I have done that, but you must understand that the car is a daily driver
and having to fight the steering wheel over every little bump was very
annoying.  The first thing I said when I got the new wheels put on was:
"Now, this is how a Porsche should feel".
