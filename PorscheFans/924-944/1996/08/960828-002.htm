Thought I'd also mention that I've ordered a set of Cup wheels.  These
are the fat spoke ones.  I've noticed that when ordering these wheels,
there were about three different iterations of this one wheel, the thin
spoke, the thin spoke with indented center and the fat spoke.  I feel
the fat spoke looks nicest and decided to order them.  Don't assume that
Carrera Cup means the fat one either as three large parts companies each
had their own idea of what the Cup wheels look like.

The size I've ordered is 17x7.5 front with 225/45R17 Dunlop SP8000 and 
17x9 rear with 255/40R17 Dunlop SP8000.  I currently have on the car 17x8
up front with 235/45R17 Yokohama AVS tires and 17x9 rear with 255/40R17
Yokohama AVS tires.  The steering feels awful with lots of rut tracking
and tramlining.  The AVS tires feel like you're driving on a Hoosier
slick!  I had SP8000s on my Talon and loved them so I'm giving them a 
try here and am sure they will feel much better than the Yokes.

Farzaan.
