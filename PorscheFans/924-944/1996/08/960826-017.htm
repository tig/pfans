A word about chips in normally aspirated 944s.  I just completed time trials
this past weekend at Summit Point.  With my '89 944 Turbo I ran in E class
with chipped non-S turbos and 3.2 911s.  There was one guy who had chipped
his 944S2 that was bumped up from F to E because of the chip.  Suffice it to
say the chipped S2, while overall a great car, was out of its league in E
class with only a chip and no suspension mods.

BTW, the best time in F class went to a driver in an S2.  I would think a
stock 968 would have a distinct advantage over a stock 944 S2 in F class.
Does anyone know why the 968 does not run in E class with the 944 Turbo S
cars?  There is only a small (11?) HP disadvantage with the same or better
suspension\brake packages available (M030).
