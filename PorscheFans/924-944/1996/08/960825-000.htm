Howdy guys,

I picked up the Porsche on Friday.  This is one sweet car to drive,
nice soft (but controlled) suspension, big wide tires, gobs of power,
and of course, it's red too.  I was expecting more people to give
me bad stares, but people in general have no idea it's a Porsche so
that's good.  Being 21 and having a nice car don't usually go too well
with some people.

Anyways, onto more important subjects.  Do your guys' 951(S) feel like
it's lurching as boost builds.  Rather than it being progressive, it
kind of lurches under part throttle, but under full throttle, it's
fine.  I was thinking it might be the barn door air flow sensor
causing that.  Perhaps the Autothority MAS upgrade might solve that.
Any comments?

Second thing is boost pressure.  What boost pressure do you 951
and 951(S) guys show on your factory gauge.  I think my Turbo S has
a boost chip in it because the boost is running at 1.9-2.0 bar which
translates into somewhere around 14.5 psi.  If I am correct, the
factory boost is 10.5 psi so that's a substantial gain.  I am not
complaining though as this car has already equaled my very fast 
Talon on a stretch of road I use for testing.

Here are a few comments if there are people lurking on the list
thinking about the 944 Turbo S.  It is a truly amazing car.  It
is beyond anything that Japan has to offer, whether it be a TT Supra,
RX-7, NSX, whatever, they cannot touch this car.  I know because I
drove all of those before buying this car and I've driven modified
ones also as a comparison.  The motor is just a jem.  It's like liquid
smooth and very refined.  There is no repair bill that could come my
way that would convince me to sell this car, no way.  The way I look at
it is, a new Supra TT goes for C$65,000.  I purchased this Turbo S for
around C$30,000.  That leaves me with C$35,000 to put into repairs
if ever the need arrises :)  I still feel I'd come out ahead even
if I did have to spend that much, it really is that much better of a
car.

Another note, the car has the factory sport seats.  They are fantastic
seats, but getting in and out is posing a problem, even for a small
5' 5" 115lb person like myself.  I'm putting in my Momo F-1 montecarlo
wheel which has a flat bottom;  that should help a bit.

On the suspension side, I would like to tighten the car up a bit, but
I don't want to disturb the perfect balance that much.  Any suggestions
to help alleviate that wavery feel when accelerating?  Keep in mind that
the Talon I drove was rock hard so any kind of movement feels unusual to
me.

Parts on order:
~ front strut tower brace
~ short throw shifter
~ front lip splitter

Farzaan.
