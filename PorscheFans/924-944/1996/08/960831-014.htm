Rotate the crank clockwise so that the belt makes at least one
complete cycle to even out the tension (more if you really want to be sure) and
stop at TDC. Then rotate the crank counter-clockwise, looking at the cam
sprocket
to make sure it moves only one and a half teeth. Only now should you measure
the tension:

New belt: 4.0 +/- 0.3 up to approx. 3000 km

Very important: Re-tension belt after 3000 km to 2.7 +/- 0.3 as it will be
quite loose
                after breaking-in. I know...my new belt started making a
funny noise
                before I re-tensioned after the 3000 km stretch.
