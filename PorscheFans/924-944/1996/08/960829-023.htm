Help! -  Earlier this summer I had a problem with my 86 951. While at the
track, it suddenly began running very rough, followed by the engine cutting
out, It was sensitive to throttle position. A Porsche master technician
happened to be at the track and took a look at it for me. He said the fuel
was shutting off for some reason and began poking around. He found the cover
had come loose on the air flow sensor and there was a lot of debris inside
the unit. A thorough cleaning of the resistive element and wiper with rubbing
alcohol and a few gentle blasts of compressed air, followed by re-sealing the
unit with RTV seemed to cure the problems -  What I have now is a similar,
but different problem. The engine runs fine up to red line in first through
third gears, with boost maxing out at 1.2 bar. Once I'm cruising in fourth
gear at 3000 rpm, if I gradually floor it, the revs build up to 4000rpm,
boost jumps up to 1.8 bar and the engine starts to miss and cut out - very
similar to the earlier air flow sensor problem, but it doesn't seem confined
to a "bad spot" on the sensor resistive element. Backing off the throttle
causes the car to run normally. At first, it didn't do this consistently. I
can duplicate these conditions and get it to act up more frequently now. It
does not do it while in neutral with the engine revved up. It seems to have
something to do with the load on the engine. Since it doesn't act up in the
first three gears, regardless of throttle position or rpms, it doesn't seem
the air flow sensor is the answer. According to the electrical tests and
specs in Haynes, it's okay. It's not the rev limiter since it occurs before
6500 rpm where the limiter kicks in. The difference in maximum boost between
the lower gears and fourth makes me wonder if it's something to do with the
turbo. Any thoughts on what this could be? TIA
