Has anyone on the list had any experiences with different turbos on there 951s?

I currently have a slightly modified K-27.  I was looking in Execellence and
have seen adds for other turbos (T44 is the main one).

What kind of experiences have people had with other turbos (than the stock) on
their cars?

>From an idle my car hits ~80% full boost by 2500rpm.  My car rockets at about
4000rpm (even though full boost has been acheived from about 3000rpm).  Boost
for 1st and 2nd never goes above 1.8 bar (on the gauge).  In third it'll go up
to 2 bar (again on the gauge), 4th and 5th are the same as third.
