  OFFICE MEMO          brake caliper problems                 Date:8/30/96

Hi P-Fans,
My '86 951 was making some creaking noises from both front calipers when I
applied firm pedal pressure, with the car stationary (engine on or off).  I
noticed this the day I was taking the car to be inspected (New Jersey), but I
wasn't too concerned since the last time I drove the car was a few weeks ago
at Lime Rock where I did my personal best laps.  Anyway, I was surprised when
the car failed inspection due to excessive front/rear brake differential.  
  With the front tires off, the creaking noise was definitely coming from both
front calipers.  The Cool Carbon pads all had 1/8 - 3/16" left.  After
removing the pads, pushing pack the pistons and installing fresh pads, and
bleeding, the creaking was gone.  Back at the inspection station I was now
told I had just marginally failed due to a 300 lb. differential between the
front left and right, but he waived it.
  Any thoughts on what caused the creaking noise and why these differentials
exist?  Is a rebuild kit available for these calipers?

Thanks,
-Jon  '86 944 Turbo, "Rejected"
