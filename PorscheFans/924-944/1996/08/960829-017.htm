944's ok?  ;-)

With my '89 944 I hear the injector solenoids clicking away happily at
idle, but off idle, there is more 'clicky/thrashy' noise which sounds like
lifters.. almost sounds like a valve adjustment is needed, but of course
that is a moot point with our hydraulic lifters.  Not sure if it is the
injectors or valves.  I wish it was quieter.  I am used to CIS cars and
their silent injectors.

With the clutch out in neutral, the driveshaft is driven, and due to the
long drivetrain and gearset, you may hear a slight rattle at idle.  5th
gear is the offender here.  PCNA apparently knows about it and says it is
normal.  Apparently the slightly looser tolerances allow it to move around
slightly on its shaft.  The type of lubricant in the box can have affect
on this noise. 

On a side note, I get a sort of metallic 'growl' from the transmission (or
the driveshaft tube, can't really tell) right off launch in first gear,
and can be heard again if I shift too early into second.  It goes away
above 1500 rpm or so.  I remember this from my ex 1979 924, and one of
the reasons I sold it was because of this noise..  couldn't afford to fix
the transmission.  It was much worse, however, and I automatically 
assumed the transmission was worn.

Nope!  No turbo  ;-(
