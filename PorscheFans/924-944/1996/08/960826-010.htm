>Could anyone answer a question I have ?

>I have just got my '86 944 Turbo back from the shop where I had my belts
>adjusted (after replacement) and the throttle switch changed replaced (burnt
>out).  Also an oil change (for good measure), but they used mineral oil and
>HD oil additive (neither of which I requested BTW - I have used Mobil 1
>since I bought the vehicle - no additives).
>
>I have had the car 4 days since the work, and twice it has been sitting at
>idle (about 1000rpm - used to be 850), and the entire car has been 'jumping'
>around.
>The first time (in CA) I thought maybe a tremor, the second time no (backed
>up by mine was the only car moving....and everyone around peering at me in a
>strange manner.)
>
>Does anyone have any idea why this is happening ?
>
>Also seems to be making some sort of grinding noise from the frot passenger
>side of the engine.
>
>BTW what is HD oil additive and should it be in these engines.  Can it be
>flushed out if required ?
