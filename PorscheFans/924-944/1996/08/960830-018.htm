As I said in previous posts, I was going to investigate some power upgrades
for this car.  My race teammate in the Talon just bought a monster turbo
and larger injectors for his car.  This mod usually nets 1/4 mile MPH
of 115-120mph and ET's of 11.30 - 11.90!  I know I won't touch him in
the ET department with the AWD, but I would like to at least bring
the Porsche up to 110-115mph on pump gas.  Once again, I am not a drag
racer, but I do use drag racing as a guide on how much power the car
is making.

To achieve this level of performance, I have laid out the following goals.
I want 300hp at the rear wheels and approx. 350hp at the flywheel.  I know
the transmission can't take much more than 375hp so this should be right
in the comfort zone.

I've so far spoken to Winward performance and this is what they recommended
to reach my goal.  BTW - using goals is the best way to build up a car,
rather than just throwing stuff on, it gives people who are selling you
something an onus of responsibility because if you don't reach your goal,
you're gonna be pissed.

~ K27-8T turbo upgrade.  You send in a Turbo S turbo and they change the
  compressor and ship it back to you.  This type of upgrade worked wonders
  on my Talon.  Moved it from 15.4 in the 1/4 to 13.1, 89mph to 104mph.
  $799 (send in core), $1399 (brand new off-the-shelf).
~ K&N cone filter (I don't like these anymore, but it may be worth a try
  as it's not very expensive).
  $99
~ 8.5mm Plug wire set (I'm going to try and get Magnecore wires for the
  car as they worked great on the Talon, no arcing, no burning).
  $89
~ Factory Bosch fuel pump upgrade.  Apparently replaces the factory unit.
  Provides fuel at a higher pressure.  This worked great in my Talon,
  we used a Dodge Stealth TT pump as an in tank replacement and it worked
  really, really well.
  $199
~ Factory Bosch adjustable fuel pressure regulator.  3-8psi higher pressure.
  I never used one of these before on the Talon, it had a boost sensitive
  one that worked fine, but Windward says it'll work.  Any opinions?
  $239
~ B&B Exhaust
  $699

Windward claims this will put the rear wheel HP at 300hp.  I am not making
any claims here, I am just giving exactly what they've told me.  Now, I'm
asking you guys with modified turbos to assist me in explaining whether
this will actually produce the result I want.  The parts in total would
seem to be what I want since it follows the same upgrade path used in
my Talon which worked great, so I'm pretty confident that it will give
the results, but I need more info from you guys.

Here is what I'm considering purchasing:

~ K27-8T turbo upgrade          $799
~ K&N conicle filter             $99
~ Fuel pump                     $199
~ Pressure regulator            $239
~ 8.5mm plug wires               $89
                                ----
Total                          $1425

Windward says to leave my current Alan Johnson Racing chip in and see how
it runs.  If it doesn't run well, they will sell their usual Autothority
stage II chip which they say works quite well.  $1425 is dirt cheap
for the level of performance they are promising.  Head gaskets should
not blow because there should no detonation with all the added fuel
being dumped in, plus boost will only be turned up to 15-17psi in
the future if the 14psi doesn't yeild the results I want.  I say only
because in the Talon camp, we all pretty much run 20psi out of the
upgraded turbos and 23psi from the mother turbos, so 14-17psi is like
stock boost to me :)

Now, what do you guys think?  I know I'm asking a lot of questions, but
once I get some reasonable opinions on these parts, I will buy them and
then I can give you guys some advice back.  If you want to see some stuff
I did for the Talon guys, check out:
