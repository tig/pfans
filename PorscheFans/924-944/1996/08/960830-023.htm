As for noises, I'm in the process of replacing my belts and I removed the 
idlers and rollers to check them.  My car also made this "clicking" noise 
which sounds exactly like valvetrain noise.  Now that I have the rollers 
and tensioners off, they are ALL bad, and at idle or greater would 
probably make this clicking noise.  I'll try to remember to let you all 
know for sure once I get it back together this weekend.

So, you out there with "clicking" sounds might want to check your 
belt-change schedules!  The newer rollers have plastic housings (the 
toothed section) and larger-diameter ball bearings.  The apparent cause 
of failure for my bearings was that the seals didn't keep the grease in 
and the dirt out.  Also, the balls are "scaling"- you can actually feel 
the ridges in the balls themselves, which doesn't please me.  Hopefully 
these new-style bearings are higher quality.

If anyone is interested, INA bearing company has distributors in the US 
and they make the rollers/tensioners for the 944.  The only catch is that 
they are all made at their German plant.  Prices don't seem to be any 
better than a parts place.

My 944 also has the throw-out bearing noise.  Anyone know what causes 
this?
