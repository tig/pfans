Tried some new things on the car today and thought I'd let you guys know
the result.  I replaced the factory air filter with a K&N filter.  When
removing the factory cold air intake and the filter cover, the rear
screws stay in the holes and the front ones are supposed to also, but I've
noticed that most slide through the holes and if you aren't fast enough,
you drop the screw in the engine bay and they get caught in that dreaded
aero engine cover (I lost two screws this way!).

It took about 10 minutes to change the filter.  I noticed a slightly
louder induction noise, less turbo lag, more responsive throttle, BUT
the flat spots in the engine power band were now amplified.  The car
also didn't seem to have as much top end power with the K&N installed.
Bizarre why that would be considering the K&N definitely looks to flow
better than the factory thick unit, but run after run, the car felt
choked in the top end and didn't feel like it was enjoying itself
past 6000rpm.  I brought the car back home and changed it back to the
factory unit and all was good again;  the car felt proper in the top end.
I made sure it was the right part number and it was, but the K&N just
didn't work too well for me;  the flat spots were annoying, the throttle
response was definitely nicer, but the top end flatness was very
noticeable.  I've stumbled upon this problem a couple of times now,
where the factory really has done their homework and what they have 
installed works the best.  Improving this beast is a tought task.

I'm still happy with the car's power, and don't forsee any power upgrades
for the near future.

Farzaan.
