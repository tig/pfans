Just thought you guys would like to know how the 951(S) did against a
modified Talon.  It's my best friend's Talon.  It runs high 12's and
low 13's in the 1/4 with an AWD launch.  His car basically has all of
my Talon's old parts on it except my turbo.  He's running a slightly
smaller Garrett turbo instead of my more responsive Mitsubishi.

We both started off at idle and both accelerated in first.  We did not
launch as he would leave me for dead with the AWD launch.  To my
surprise, his car has virtually no lag compared to my 951(S).  He
hits boost, accelerates like a bat out of hell and when he's done with
first and shifting into second is when my boost comes on strong in 
FIRST!  From then on though, I have to play catchup which is kind of 
fun.  I managed in one race to catch up to his door and in the second
race, I managed to pass him, but on both occasions, he misshifted and
I did not so had he not misshifted, he would have won both races.

This does not bother me though as my car is basically stock except for
maybe a chip (haven't gotten around to opening the 50 million screws to
get to the computers) and his car is a very fast machine.  Also, I can
do it with a nice quiet and luxurious ride :)

Decided to not get the short shift kit and the front strut brace.  Many
racers said there would be no benefit so why bother.  I am still getting
the front splitter though as I like the looks.

Farzaan.
