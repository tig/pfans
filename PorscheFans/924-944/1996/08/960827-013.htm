I wouldn't.  I can't live without that awesome turbo rush.  An NSX
is a very nice car, but it's very different than a Porsche, any of
them for that matter.  There's more to driving than just how it feels
from the driver's seat.  I love it when I go to work in the morning and
shut my driver's door and hear that precise thunk as the door shuts,
no binds, no creaks, just a perfect thunk.

I must say that the engine materials used in the NSX are quite wild,
but once again, I'd take a pre-historic turbo motor over a normally
aspirated high tech wonder any day.  Actually, I prefer a pre-historic
turbo motor instead of the newer turbo motors simply for the reason that
they are much more fun waiting for the boost to build and then wammo,
gotta dial in that countersteer.

The Canadian model did not come with airbags or maybe the previous
owner did not order them.  He did order the sport seats, and I am
greatful for that!  The only bad part is, I sprained something
getting out of the car this morning, I have to master a new technique.

On the boost chip note, I found out that I do in fact have some sort
of EPROM mod.  The computer was shipped out to Alan Johnson Racing or
what is now known as AJ-USA.  This was done when the car was new in
1989 so I expect the chip just turns the boost up with maybe a bit more
fuel added in here and there.  It won't be as sophisticated as the
new Authothority two stage chips.

I had the opportunity to go for a boot in a fellow racer's car with
the Autothority stage II chip with the orifice thing.  It has much more
midrange than my car does and gets rid of that surging (which all 
Turbo S's do from the posts I got back) under part throttle in the lower
RPMs.  It might just be perception because the midrange is stronger,
but I feel my car is much faster;  when I hit boost in 1st, the rear
tires start to spin and only catch around 6500rpm and then it's soon
time to switch to second and again a little bobble from the back
and off it goes.  His car would hook fine and built boost much more
progressive.  Maybe Autothority wanted to make the car feel more
linear;  I prefer the explosion effect, but I bet the linear method
would be faster around a track, but I'll stick with my slower, but much
funner method.  And, anyways, who the hell drives in the midrange 
anyways in these cars :)

Farzaan.
