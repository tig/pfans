My understanding is that you are at least as likely to tear up the socket
head of a hex allen as a triple-square, insofar as it is only a question
of design strength.  I don't think that it is quite true that the head always
strips on removal, and I believe that if you treat them as single-use parts,
you're going to generally be OK.

If you do want to go with an allen, make sure the grip and thread lengths
match the original part, as well as material strength matching (10.9).
