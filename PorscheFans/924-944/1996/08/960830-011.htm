I'm picking up the Carrera Cup 17" wheels today so I decided to take
a close look at the OZ 3-pce wheels on the car at this time before
I trade them in.  It turns out that they are HUGE.  The front's are
17x8.5 with 235/45R17 and the rear's are 17x10 with 255/40R17.  Wow,
I'm kind of downgrading by going to 17x7.5 and 17x9, but I think these
will rub at track days.

Boost pressure.  Hooked up the autometer boost gauge from my Talon
on the Porsche and found the boost pressure exactly where I expected it.
The boost builds up to 14psi, sometimes 15psi.  At high, high rpm's,
like 6500rpm right before the limiter, the boost starts to pull
down to around 11-13psi.  Stock boost for a 951(S) I believe is
10.5 psi, right?

I'm considering a newer, larger turbo for the car to bring the car's
performance one step above my Talon's (in a straight line that is)
and some added fuel.

For the people who enjoy my posts, I'll warn you that I will tell good
news as well as bad news, so you may hear in the future that I ended
up blowing something up or hitting something at the track.  I've had
an interesting past with cars.  I had a 1992 FWD Talon which was
crushed by a drunk driver (C$32,000 in damage, write off).  I then
bought a 1994 AWD Talon and 20km out of the dealership, the engine
caught fire (C$30,000 in damage, write off).  I then purchased,
guess what, a 1992 AWD Talon which I raced for a little over a year.
I blew all sorts of things in that car, a turbo, 2 clutches (Centerforce
Clutches!), numerous sets of pads and rotors.  I ran the car for
40 laps with *NO* coolant in it because I wanted to pass this pesky
911.  Once I passed him, I pulled in.  8 months later, I had to pull
to top off the motor to re-ring it from scored cylinder walls from
that overheating incident.  I don't intend on breaking that much
stuff on the Porsche, but it may happen so be prepared :)

Farzaan.
1989 944 Turbo S - 14psi.
