What boost pressures are you getting in gears 1-3 and wide open throttle (WOT)?
If it is really 1.2 bar then something is wrong. You should be getting 1.8 bar
in ALL gears, especially 1-3. 

To me, is seems like there's a problem with one of the sensors that controls
the turbo boost, or something like that. It sounds boost related.

At idle, and even at part throttle, you aren't developing enough boost to
cause a problem.

Lets start with some simple things. When was the last time the spark plugs, 
wires, distributor cap and rotor were changed? How about the fuel injectors?
If any of those components are in poor condition, the car is not going to
be able to develop full boost.
