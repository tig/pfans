    Advice needed:

    Problem- Cruising down the hwy, temp gauge starts quickly moving to
    red. Pull over, coolant has sprayed all over the left side of the
    engine. (Facing the engine).

    Look down at waterpump, main hose is loose and is leaking coolant out
    the seam/connection point to the water pump. Tighten hose clamp,
    re-fill coolant reservoir with water, start her up. Starts fine, as we
    accelerate back up to speed temp gauge starts moving to red zone again.
    After 1-2 minutes we red warning (temp light comes on). Make it to a
    gas station and shut her down within 2 more minutes.

    At this stage I have it towed to the garage.

    I am thinking water pump, possible head gasket.

    Mechanic is not convinced it is a water pump when I call, because he
    says it is still pressurizing. They also do a leak down test, negative.

    At this point they think it was a faulty/worn radiator cap, replace
    this, they say temp is at normal. I tell him about the hose and he says
    he will check it for tightness.

    Has anyone experienced this type of a sudden temp spike, with a faulty
    cap, and a possible loose hose as the problem(s). Want to make sure
    they have found everything or the right problem.

    thanks,

    Byron
