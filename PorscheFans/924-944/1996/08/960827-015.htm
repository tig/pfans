Just wanted some input from you guys, especially the ones that track
drive their cars (and also opinions from street drivers too).

When you removed your cat convertor, what were the changes you noticed,
ie. noise, performance, throttle response, etc.  I would only be doing
this on the track or at auto-x, but unlikely on the street.

What is the list's opinion on changing the OEM air filter to a conicle
K&N unit conversion that you can purchase from Windward, etc.  My 
thoughts are that the colder air coming from the duct is probably
better than sucking in all the hot engine air, but the duct may also
be limiting the amount of air that can be sucked in.  Plus, I would
expect that the K&N would produce some wild induction noises when
the boost comes on.  Any opinions, thoughts, experiences gladly accepted!

Thanks,
Farzaan.
