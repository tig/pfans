Adam,

FWIW, my '87 944 Turbo uses a quart of Mobil 1 about every 600 miles, and=
 has since new (now has about 53,000 miles on it).

At the track, that consumption increases substantially -- I will usually =
end up adding about a half quart per day at the track.

So, I quit worrying about 5 years ago.

--Lou

I know that the oil consumption rate as listed by Porsche in the
owners manual is relatively high, but at what point does this become
excessive?

I have a 1989 944 Turbo S, with 69k miles on the odometer - which is
burning quite consistently about a quart every 400 to 500 miles.
The engine does *not* leak oil (I've checked, and had three independent
verifications), and the compression is even and good across all four
cylinders.  I've been using Mobil 1 for the past year, though the previou=
s
two owners used Castrol.  The car hasn't been tracked (yet) and is used
about 50/50 for city/highway driving.

Any ideas on where all this oil is going?  Should I be worried?  Is
is time to think of the oil rings, or the valve guides, or...?

Thanks for any input,
Adam.
