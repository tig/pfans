Just wanted to get some people'e experiences about noises coming form
their 951(S).

~ Injector noise seems to be obnoxious on this car and the firing order
  seems to make a rhythmatic cycling sound as you drive around 3-4000rpm.
  Is that the injectors I'm hearing?

~ Throwout bearing or gearbox noise when the clutch is out and the gear
  box is in neutral.  When you put the clutch in or load the box, the
  noise goes away.  I've been told it's throwout bearing or 5th gear.
  Both are apparently quite normal.

Has anyone tried the heat mat from Automotion for the 944 Turbo?  Do
the non "S" models come with hood insulation?  I would love to quiet 
down those noisy injectors and to protect the hood paint too, but I
don't want to compromise anything by adding that.  Who knows why the
Porsche engineers didn't stick it on, maybe weight, maybe cooling???

Wheels are going on the car tommorow, then I'll put some pics up.

We have quite the Porsche gathering out here now in our local racing
club in Vancouver, B.C.  We now have:
~ 1996 AWD 911 Turbo
~ 1989 944 Turbo S (red, mine)
~ 1989 944 Turbo S (black, Patrick Tsai)
~ 1988 944 Turbo S (oyster, Tim Stark)
~ 1991 944 S2 (red, Wes Shew)
~ 1986 944 Turbo (white, Rich Hoffman)
~ 1986 911 Carrera LW (silver, Harry Dether)

Not bad considering that the club only has about 120 members!  Another
interesting thing about the 944 Turbos is that each and every one has
a chip or is modified.  Should make for an interesting racing season.

Farzaan.
