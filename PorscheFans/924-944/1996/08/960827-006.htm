Hi Adam:

Near the end of Porschephile's life, I conducted a quasi-survey on 944/951 
oil consumption.  The incentive for the survey was one of my friends ('87 
944) had exactly the same concern as yours.  Basically, the survey result 
was that one qt. in 400-500 miles is quite high, but might be a result of 
driving style.  If you drive your 951 hard consistently, it will use lots of 
oil.  Hard driving was what my friend was doing, and he found that oil 
consumption decreased significantly when he drove his p-car more chalmly 
(during an almost-all interstate trip, it increased from your level to about 
one quart per 1500 miles).

Cheers,

Pete Morley
another '87 944
