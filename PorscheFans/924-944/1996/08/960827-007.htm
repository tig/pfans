Adam, my 951S generally gets about 2,500 miles per quart of oil. However,
when driving in Montana (140+) it gets about 400 miles per quart of oil ;)
What's your driving style like?

The use of Mobil 1 is probably the answer. My understanding is that going
from synthetic to regular oil is ok but going from regular oil to synthetic
results in the synthetic running right through the engine.
