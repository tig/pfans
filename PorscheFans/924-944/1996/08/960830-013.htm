I have an 83 944 and as you may know the rear end is raked up to meet bumper
hieght regs.  Does anyone know how and what parts are needed to level out
the car?  And maybe lower it as well.  The front doesn't seem to be a
problem, there's enough spring kits around to solve that problem it's just
the rear.
By the way I have the same trans. noises but haven't noticed any noise in
5th.  However, each time I depress the clutch I get a click.  I talked to a
transmission guy (the best in my small town) and he wasn't too worried about
it YET. Hmmmm?
