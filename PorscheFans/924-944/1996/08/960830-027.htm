I had trouble understanding that table.  The way I read it, the
two columns are miles at which the original failed, and miles
since replacement (ie. the replacements are still running).  Not
a handle on MTBF on the new pump.

If OTOH, the second column is indeed failures of the replaced
pump, then the sample space is not too representative -- for eg,
it does not represent the person who told me (when I had my
water break), that his japanese water pump replacment failed
again in just a month, and I should pass on it.

I agree with you there in suspecting that installation care and
torques should make a big difference, alongwith part quality.
Not to mention proper coolant bleeding to avoid collateral
head-gasket damage.

I got the Euroselect part, and had the job done by the wrench in
the entire town that impressed me the most on a phone interview
for technical thoroughness, never mind the labour rate. (The
pump broke on the highway miles from home).  

(my data: 924, failure at 90k miles, dont know if it was factory
orig, 4000 miles on euroselect, touch wood).
