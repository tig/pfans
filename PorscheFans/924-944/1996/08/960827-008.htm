    This may be a repost due to some Post Office movement at my site, so
    sorry if it is. I saw a post where someone was interested in H2O pump
    failures.

    Well, after a 4000K mile/30 day trip thru Nevada, Utah, Wyoming and
    back to California, within 100K miles of San Jose my waterpump blew.
    This pump according to the records was installed almost *exactly* 10K
    miles ago, not due to failure but to belt maintenance etc. (The car 88-
    944TS) now has 51K miles.

    It is now at the shop, I have not yet received a estimate but gather
    that approx 1000.00 will be needed. Since all the belts were done 10K
    miles ago should they also be replaced or can they be safely reused or
    is this an issue? I am also going to get tires soon, and gather that
    most everyone like BFG ZR's. The seem good to me. (3 year old BFG's
    currently.)

    As a side note I replaced the stock Reno cassette with a Blaupunkt New
    Orleans unit, which sucked in every way. (One of the worst tuners in
    history). Now have a Sony CD/MD 0610 detachable, 35X4 unit in there and
    it is excellent. It has a 3 second memory buffer, so it will rarely
    skip, and has excellent stock power, plus a unique auto sun sensing
    display switch, (from default amber to a silver/green color) so you can
    see the display clearly in direct sunlight. Get this is you are in the
    market for one. I paid 520.00 installed. 470 approx, mailorder.

    Anyway, trip was fun, 140.00 mph blasts, no tickets. (Also bought a
    cordless bell, 745 or 850sti i believe, performed well.)

    Now if that waterpump will only last 50K miles or more...
