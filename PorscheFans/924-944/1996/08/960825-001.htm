Outwardly, it is virtually identical to any ordinary motorcycle front fork.
Go look at a motorcycle. The optional shock absorber is INSIDE the fork tube.
(Shock absorber is not the same thing as elastomeric spring elements).

The "Headshok" (Cannondale?) design doesn't have a shock between the fork
tubes. That red thing you see in the ads between the fork tubes is the
headtube of the bicycle frame, which goes between the upper and lower triple
clamps. Any shock absorbing elements have to be installed inside one or both
fork tubes. The Porsche front fork is essentially similar except that the
Cannondales are what is called an "inverted fork" in motorcycle practice, the
Porsche isn't. The Porsche has the larger diameter tube, the slider, at the
bottom, and the smaller stanchions at the top, attached to the frame with
triple clamps. The fork used in the Porsche bike also has a few other design
refinements (the way the handlebars stiffen the fork, for instance).

The Porsche forks are made by Votec in Germany. Votec is in Tiefenbronn,
another small village about 5 miles from Weissach.

Marzocchi makes forks for motorcycles and now for mountain bikes. They are
not inverted designs, they have the fat end at the bottom, but they don't
have the triple clamp design of the Porsche/Votec or Cannondale/Headshok.
They just have a single tube which enters the bottom of the headtube. These
are $500 forks. 

>What is the payoff of using hydraulic brakes without discs? Given that there
is usually
a weight penalty with hydraulics and that the conventional brake systems
(e.g. new Shimano XTR?) offer lightness, and one-finger operation is there
really any
advantage? 

Much better brake feel. No cables to stretch. Pads move in squarely toward
rim, not on an arc. Also note that even if you were to get a Headshok front
fork for your bike and wanted Shimanos on it, you can't have them; the ads
say "disk brake only." The Porsche designs come either way (rim brake on low
end, disk brake on high end).

>Does the Porsche bike have rear suspension? It seems this is the trend with
the
high-end mtn bikes.

Porsche has two bikes, one without, one with rear suspension. The rear
suspension is by Fox Alps 4 shock.
