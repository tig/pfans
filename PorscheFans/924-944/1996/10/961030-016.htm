I need to clarify what I wrote earlier:  The brake callipers were MY86, but
the
spindles and rotors were (and need to be) MY87.  As some may know, Porsche
diddled the suspension geometry a tad for MY87, both to accomodate ABS and
to introduce "negative scrub radius", the nuance of which elude me at the
moment.

Oh yeah, and when you slap those big callipers on, your 15" rims no longer
fit!

I would say that updating to the turbo brakes made for me a night-and-day
difference.  They are so much better than the single-pot, floating calliper
brakes.  There are not too many changes I've made to my car which are
so direct and noticeable; this was one for sure.
