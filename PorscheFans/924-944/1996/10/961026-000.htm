Hi everyone on the list. I just discovered PorscheFans last night via
Automotion.
So this is my first message.
I bought a 944-automatic from 1985 in may this year. The car is in a
reasonable shape, but I will sure have some
work to do on it. Since I'm new to this kind of stuff, I have some questions.

To start with, it leaks engine oil. Is it possible to replace oilseals
(front engine (crank) seal, rear engine seal, etc) without
taking out the engine?

Second, when turning the steeringwheel while standing still or moving very
slow their is some noise coming from the
right lower front. Is this the steeringhouse that's asking to be replaced or
do I just need to lubricate some parts?

When the car is just started, e.g. is cold, switching the transmission into
reverse works smoothly. But after driving for
about half an hour or so, when things got warmed up, shifting into reverse
goes along with a firm shock you can feel
and hear. Does anyone knows what's wrong and how to cure this?

My rear window (sounds like it really is the glass) makes a strange
crackling noise when driving on rough roads.
Is this normal for these cars? That's what I've been told.

I'm using unleaded fuel at the moment (octane 98). I've been told that on
these old cars leaded fuel will give me
longer valve lifes. Is this true and should I switch to leaded fuel?

Most of the time my turnsignal works fine, but there are moments that it
does nothing! Do I need to buy a new one or
is it possible to take it apart and clean or fix it?

Where can I get some more info on the car? A good maintenance manual, a FAQ,
etc.

I ran into Automotion on the internet. They sell parts much less expensive
then the regular Porsche dealer.
Does anyone has any experience with their parts, is it good quality or
should I just stick with original Porsche stuff?

Ok, that's it for now. I have a feeling You will be hearing more from me in
time to come.

Best regards,

J.Graanoogst  ( mickey@worldaccess.nl )
