Maybe it's been redesigned:  The OEM replacement I got from Zim's did not have a
split.   

I had also written:

Your comment is, I'm sure, in regard to preventing the rod knock (if that's what
is was).  But the possible lifter problem would not be helped by priming the
system. My understanding is that when the lifter problem *does* occur, it is the
consequence of 1) deposits building up in the passages of the lifter,
effectively ending normal oil circulation through the lifter, and trapping the
oil that is in there (hence they maintain their desired height during engine
operation, perhaps with *some* makeup), 2) the trapped oil seeping out over an
extended non-running period, and then 3) when the engine is subsequently run,
the deposits prevent oil from reentering and pumping the lifter back up to the
height neccessary to eliminate the lash.  

That I did not have this problem to any significant degree is consistent with
the absence of deposits I saw behind the crank oil seal.  I suppose that Castrol
GTX did its job.
