My 89 951s *always* turns ~5 times before it starts.  Even if the car has just
been shut off.   Also my older 84 944 :) usually fired up right away (except if
it was cold (<20 degrees), then it never fired :( ).

Since it takes 5 turns to start right after I shut the engine off, I'm assuming
the DME has something to do with with not sparking the engine until it has spun
a couple of times.  (I'm assuming there is still gas present in the system, so
the reason it doesn't start is not because of no gas)

It's not a bug...it's a FEATURE... :)
