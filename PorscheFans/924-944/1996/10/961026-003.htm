The parts which circulate water into the interior of the car are separate
from the stuff you were working on (at least in the earlier cars).  Double
check that there really isn't hot water circulating into the interior of
the car by either touching the metal hose on the passenger's side, under
the center console, where it feeds into the interior radiator, or else by
hitting the "defrost" button with the heat turned up all the way.  If you
still don't get any heat, check in the engine compartment for the water
shutoff valve and see if it's stuck or something (although it normally gets
stuck open, not closed).

If you're for sure not getting heat into the interior, then try
disconnecting either one of the two vacuum lines to the solenoid-operated
vacuum valve on the passenger's side.  If you remove the glove box, it's
easy to access.  There's two valves, both marked Nippondenso.  The lower
one is what controls that shutoff valve in the engine bay.  If you
disconnect either one of the vacuum lines and you have hot water, then the
valve needs to be replaced.

If you are getting heat into the interior radiator, then you've got a
problem similar to one posted here recently, which is probably a small
plastic piece on the driver's side which controls the flaps that direct the
incoming air past the radiator.  That's what it was in my car.  If you poke
your head underneath the driver's side with the engine off and the key on
(so the fans work), you can fiddle with the temperature control and you'll
notice a small rod which moves a flap.  The plastic on the end of that rod
was the culprit on my car.  Hope this helps!
