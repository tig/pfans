Sounds like you’re almost there.  You will need to disconnect the accelerator
actuator rod and remove the pedal.  Now, simply add about three or four
washers over the right hand pedal mounting stud.  Then, bend the accelerator
actuator rod to the left with either large channel locks or a web belt
wrapped around it.  Make sure the accelerator actuator rod is in alignment
with the pedal.  Re-install the pedal and enjoy.  I've done this mod myself
and it does help.  However, you may have to experiment with the exact number
of washers.
