I agree...however, if the idlers and tensioners have been replaced, the
whirring can be caused by the belts (usually the balance shaft belt) being
tensioned too tightly.  They are gonna make more noise when new until they
break in, but if the noise is very noticeable, check the tension & see if
the idlers have bee replaced.
