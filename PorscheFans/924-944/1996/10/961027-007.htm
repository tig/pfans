The shift quality of an auto-trans. is controlled by vacuum. Usually there is
a vacuum line running from the intake manifold to a vacuum modulator on the
transmission. This modulator controls how hard or soft the shifts are. If there
is too much vacuum, you can get slipping and the engine will rev before it
completes the shift. If there is not enough vacuum, the shift will be hard
and will 'clunk' when it shifts. There may also be other inline vacuum control
valves which are activated dependent on engine temperature. Perhaps there is
a vacuum leak somewhere in the line that goes to the modulator? I know on
Mercedes' transmissions there is a little key in the vacuum modulator that you
can rotate to adjust for a softer or firmer shift, but to have to do this
if the transmission was previously ok, is usually considered a band-aid
solution.

- Check that the fluid level is correct
- Check for vacuum leaks if this applies to the 944 auto
- Replace the transmission filter

If the problem still persists, I'd get it checked out professionally.

Though Automotion is usually a trouble-free and safe place to buy parts from,
I'd consider their prices one of the more 'dealer-like' of the mail-order
outfits...in other words, most other places are cheaper.

Another 'trick' they like to pull is to send you mailers declaring a XX % off
sale on all parts. What they don't stress is that the discount is on their new
prices which have gone up from their current catalog. The resulting discount 
is usually not very significant.
