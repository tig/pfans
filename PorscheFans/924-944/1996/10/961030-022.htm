Are you getting a handheld or a transportable one for the car? I just 
bought a Nokia 2160 from AT&T for $240 with no yearly contract required 
but you do need to activate with their new PCS service but you cancel 
after 30 days. There is no cancellation fee. I am not sure how long the 
promotion run as well as if the promotion is available in your area since 
the PCS service may not be available in your area.
 
It's special promotion deal from them. I've seen most places are selling 
them for around $370. It's the latest generation of digital cell phone, 
IS-136 digital channel control. It is also a dual mode phone i.e. you 
can switch from digital to analog. I am using it with their new PCS 
digital service. Oh! The phone double as a pager, it can receive numeric 
and text message, it has bunch of features like caller id, voice 
messaging, calling waiting, 3 way calling and call forwarding. 

Also in the first quarter you going to see a bunch of new cell phones 
coming on the market, since every wireless companies are jumping on the 
PCS bandwagon. There are going to be about three different types of new 
phones coming out i.e. TMDA/D-AMPS(IS-136) like mine, PCS1900 and CDMA 
phones. 

Ericsson also has phone that are IS-136 standard but I like the bigger 
display on the Nokia plus the very user friendly menu with online help text.
