        From what I've gleaned from the literature, the main concern was
price. The 2.5 liter engine was there at the time of 944 turbo development,
so they used it, as was the case with the 924 racing turbos. At the time,
Porsche saw no need to go to the 16-valve configuration or a larger
displacement with the addition of a turbo. After the 3.0 liter was
developed, Porsche did produce a limited number of 968 Turbos (we never saw
it over here) that I think was a twin-turbo design.  300+ hp in street and
racing levels.  

Concerns with increasing power on both the 2.5  and 3.0 liter turbos was
(1) internal competition and pricing relative to the 911, (2) the cost of
building up the 944/968 to match the added power and (3) pricing relative
to other companies.  Porsche had a tough time rationaizing a 944/968 that
was as expensive as its 911s, and the 944/968s were already more expensive
the competitors like Mazda, Mitsubishi and Nissan, even tho the Porsche had
less hp. Adding more power would have made the cost differential worse.

Porsche had plans to produce a 300+ hp 944 after the 944S Turbo - too bad
they didn't. They thought that they couldn't afford turning the 944/968
into supercar when the 911 was perceived as the "real" Porsche, and the
944/968 market was shrinking. I wonder if they were correct.

Anyway -- my interpretation of this segment of Porsche history.
