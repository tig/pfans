I have an `84 944 that I have owned since new (and put about 60,000 miles on),
and I've finally gotten around to paying some long overdue attention to it,
having been distracted for some years by work, family, and kart racing (not
necessarily in that order).  I took the car out of service in January when I
noticed a little puddle of anti-freeze under the right front every time I parked
it. In July I started the obligatory waterpump/ belts/ rollers/ etc. job.  Last
week my buddy who owns the tension gage finally found time to come check the
belts (the gage comes only with operator <g>), and last night I cranked it up.
Given this leisurely pace, here's a few  observations from along the way:

-Wrench clearance around the bolt heads is a problem when removing the starter
motor, and I couldn't seem to find a metric wrench that fit any closer or better
than a 3/4" boxend.  With the front up on jackstands, there is insufficient
floor clearance to get a cheater on the wrench for leverage, but a medium size
ball pein hammer does the trick, both at removal and reinstallation.

-The OEM cam belt was a Gates.  The belt I *had* installed at 39,000 mi was, it
turns out now, also a Gates.  Neither one looked the worse for wear when they
were removed.  This time, I ordered up a bunch of parts from Zim's, and the belt
that arrived looked different from the Gates belts:  It had a looser weave on
the fabric surface of the teeth.  And it had no indication of the manufacturer's
name.  When I inadvertently rotated the tension roller all the way through its
travel and heard a faint "pop", I called Zim's to get the name of the
manufacturer, so I could call them for counsel.  In that conversation I learned
that Zim's is supplied by a half dozen belt manufacturers, and they had no idea
who made mine.  So I called Gates, and spoke to one of their engineers.  Here I
learned several things:  1) Porsche uses the HTD tooth profile on their belts
(same as what I use on my racing kart, BTW), 2) the HTD profile (which minimizes
stresses at the root of the tooth, the usual failure site) was invented by US
Rubber, whose timing belt business Gates bought out years ago, and continues to
operate, 3) Gates is an OEM supplier to Porsche today for timing belts (*and*
timing gears, if I recall correctly), and 4) Gates makes the house-brand timing
belts sold by the NAPA auto parts chain.  Being a creature of logic, my next
move was to `can the anonymous Zims belt and drive down to the local NAPA store
for a replacement I could trust.  I think I paid $18.

-I bought seals to do all four shafts (crank/cam/bal/bal) at the front of the
engine, but, based on minimal evidence of oil leakage, and the advice of Tom
Charlsworth, I decided to change only the crank seal.  When I removed this item,
I noticed a thin shiny groove on the sealing surface of the splined sleeve that
drives the oil pump, undoubtedly worn into it by the rubber seal (funny how that
can be, but it is).  Reasoning that a new seal has little liklihood of sealing
against such a wear pattern, I replaced the sleeve too (about $53).

-When I removed the distributer cap, I noted that the grey plastic dust shield
behind the rotor was split radially.  The thought occurred to me that this may
have been done intentionally by the shop that replaced the belts the last time,
as it would save removing the rotor when removing the cam gear cover -- and the
rotor did turn out to be time consuming to get off.  

-When I removed the water pump, I saw what was to prove the worst news of the
whole job (and that should tell you something):  There was corrosion on all the
screws and studs that fasten the pump to the block.  Judging by the wettish,
yellowish, cruddy appearance, I concluded this was galvanic corrosion between
the cadmium plating of the fasteners and the aluminum of the block, promoted by
coolant seepage through the gasket joint.  When I installed the new (rebuilt)
pump, I inadvertently pulled the first thread or two out of one of the tapped
holes (on the long screw).  Thereafter, I was afraid to put full torque on this
one. If the joint leaks, my backup plan is to put in a longer screw (custom made
if necessary), to grab more threads.  This screw is accessible with all the belt
covers, etc., installed.

-Zims will only sell you a pump rebuilt on a core identical to yours, i.e early
for early, mid for mid, late style for late style.  Mine is mid style (gasket on
thermostat sealing surface, but no casting feature to prevent cam belt contact
between top and bottom courses).  What *came* was early style, so I had to send
it back.  The purpose of the gasket is apparently to speed up heater warmup when
the thermostat is closed.  The casting feature would be nice to have as a "risk
management" item, but my favorable experience with Gates belts *not* slackening
reduces the value of that.  The only time the previous belts were tensioned was
at installation and 1000 miles later.

-Although this is not as timely as it might have been 12 years ago, my
preventive for a repeat of the corrosion problem is to make up the coolant using
deionized water (non-conductive).  That, and the use of threadlocker on the
(new) pump fasteners.

-I had no problem at all bleeding the cooling system of air.  I may be wrong,
but I think the *air* of this problem originates not from the passages filled by
the rising liquid, but from the water itself.  The deionized water I used had
absolutely no bubbles clinging to the walls of the plastic jugs I had it in.
Perhaps one could get the same effect by simply letting your mix water, e.g. tap
water, stand for a few days before mixing with antifreeze.  As for the other
possibility, I *did* put in the coolant with the front end jacked up, and then
let down the RF for final topoff. When I warmed up the engine and opened the
bleed screw, there didn't appear to be any bubbles in the liquid that came out.
Incidentally, I used Prestone phosphate/silicate-free (silver jug, orange cap,
orange color liquid).  I had ordinary Prestone "for aluminum engines" in before,
but even so, there was hardly any coating on the water passage I could see when
the top fitting was off, nor on the water pump cavity.

-I fixed (I hope) my longstanding power steering pump leak, at the
reservoir/hose joint, with the new, short-cut-to-the-pump, hose, and *two*
ordinary hose clamps, straddling the ridge on the spigot.

-Since I saw only a trace of varnish buildup on the backside of the crank seal
(i.e. on the sleeve surface right behind this seal), I was reassured that
changing from Castrol GTX to Mobil 1 would cause no problems with seal leakage.
Someone please advise if I'm mistaken.

-My biggest anxiety upon startup was that the lifters wouldn't pump up.  In the
event, I got what I guess was a rod knocking for perhaps a second, as the oil
pressure came up.  There was some lifter-sounding noise but it gradually
subsided to what I best remember it sounded like before I took it out of
service.

Despite the time it took *me* to do this job (at which time I did a bunch of
convenient side jobs as well), it was not all that bad.  At first glance it
looks daunting, due to the close quarters of the engine bay, but it is
straightforward to remove all the components you *should* to gain access.  There
are no knuckle busters if you do this.  The biggest bang for the buck,
effortwise, is when you drop the fan assembly.  Applause to Porsche for
serviceability.
