Don't know if they break often, but with age they do tend to get brittle &
can crack along the neck and down the seams.  If it is cracked, replace it.
 I've tried repairing one, & it just doesn't hold up.  Epoxy starts leaking
about 30 min after use, so I don't think that anything will fix them once
they have cracked.
