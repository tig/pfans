Barry: May have missed your post but I take it from the response that it was 
about towing with a Jeep Cherokee.  Came back from a time trial last nite and 
passed a club member towing a closed trailer(22', 2700#) with a 2300# car.  He 
had a new Jeep Cherokee Super Grand Limited whatever with the V-8 and was 
tucked in behind a Tractor trailer, drafting, so I assume it was a bit of a 
load for him to pull with any stability.  I have a Ford E350 van, 460 V-8.  
Whistles along at 75 with 4500# in the rear......I've always felt that those 
SUV's had too small a wheelbase to be pulling that kind of weight.  Don't 
think they're stable enough but quite a few guys use 'em.
