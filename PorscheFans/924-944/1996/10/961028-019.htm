Due to the rash of Motor Mount questions recently I am re posting my less
than definitive description on which mounts to use and how to install them.
Have fun!!

Guide to 944 Motor Mount replacement

This is a straight forward mechanical job that doesn’t require any special
gauges, tool, etc. but it is far from easy. I did it in a day without a lift
or a helper, both of which would be beneficial. It does require patience, a
reasonable amount of skill and some more patience. 
I am sure there are other ways to do this but I’ll relate how I did it
successfully on two different cars. Feel free to read a manual or use a
different  sequence. I did this on an 89 Turbo so there may be some
differences in your car.

1.  Get the right parts. The newest mounts are #951 375 042 04. I paid $160
for two. Usually the left mount will be OK but replace it anyway since you
really don’t want to do this job twice. You also need 4 bolts. Size 8mm x
40mm. Interestingly enough Porsche now packages two mounts to a box. Draw
your own conclusions
2.  Get the car up on jack stands as high as possible and make sure that you
did a good job of this. It’s going to ruin your day if the car falls off the
stands. 
3.  Take off the front wheels. (you did loosen them before you jacked it up?)
4.  Remove the belly pan and put all the little nuts, bolt and screws in a
container.
5.  Remove the front sway bar. Unbolt it from the control arm and the frame
and set it aside. It gets in the way of everything.
6.  Remove the sheet metal heat shields that block access to the motor
mounts. (like they did any good in the first place) 10mm bolts here.
7.  Remove both the lower motor mount nuts. One on each side where the mount
goes through the crossmember. This is 17mm and requires an open end wrench
and patience.
8.  Remove the upper motor mount bolts. They are difficult to reach
(especially the front one) and you again will need patience and two 13mm
wrenches. They were particularly difficult in my car since the nuts were
imbedded in the collapsed motor mount, which is rubber. When you get these
bolts loose discard them so you don’t mistakenly reuse them as they are too
long for the new mounts. Save the thick washers.
9.  At this point you need to support the engine. Get a board and use it to
distribute the force when you jack up the engine on the oil pan. Jack it up
until the tension is taken off the motor mounts. Be very careful you don’t
jack the front of the car off the jack stands. 
10.  Take a sharp instrument and make a scribe mark around the rear of the
control arm where two bolts hold it to the chassis. If you do this you *may*
avoid a realignment when you are finished.
11.   Unbolt the crossmember from the chassis. There are two 19mm bolts in
the front and the two aforementioned bolts at the rear of the control arm
(17mm). The whole crossmember should now drop down. 
12.   Remove the old mounts ( you will have to twist them around a bit) but
be sure and note their orientation. There is a stud that indexes in the
crossmember and you can put these on improperly. It is a struggle to get
these out and a struggle to get the new ones in. Make sure the rubber "ear"
of the new mount is tucked into the side of the crossmember and the
projection on the bottom of the new mount corresponds to the stud on the old
ones. It will be obvious how this works if you compare the old to the new.
13.  You are now ready to put everything back together. This is probably the
hardest part of the job because the engine bosses and the new mounts have to
line up or you won’t be able to able to start the NEW 8 x 40 bolts that hold
the mounts to the engine bosses. These bolts go through the engine bosses and
into the mounts. Be sure and use one of the old, thick,  washers with these
bolts. I had to bolt the crossmember back on to the frame lightly and raise
and lower the engine a number of times until I got all four bolts started. I
also had to horse the crossmember around a number of times to achieve this.
Be patient and don’t cross thread those bolts. They must start cleanly or
everything is not lined up. You are now home free when this happens.
14.  When you bolt everything back together, if you are very lucky, you will
be able to bolt the rear control arm bolts back up and have the control arm
line up with those scribe marks. If you can’t achieve this (on one car I did
and the other I couldn’t ) you won’t need to re align the car. You can move
the crossmember around to a certain extent but it still isn’t easy to get
those damn marks to align. 
15.  Replace everything that you removed and tighten all bolts to spec. I
don’t remember the torque specs of the various chassis bolts since I don’t
have a manual handy. Maybe someone can supply these torque figures.
16.  Start the engine and be amazed at the difference!!
