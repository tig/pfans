Okay, here is the deal.  I am trying to decide wether to use my newly 
acquired 90 944 S2 more often than I had planned.  I had expected to use 
this car mainly as an autox and track car and drive my Audi quattro as 
the daily driver.  I find myself wanting a nicer car for the daily drive 
and need to make a decision.  Do I use the 944 or buy another large 
Mercedes?  I know they are completly different cars, so lets not enter 
that discussion.  It comes down to economics:

What will a 90 944 S2 with about 90k miles on it be worth in 4 years?

What will the same car be worth with 150k miles in 4 years?

I need to figure out if the cost of driving it is worth it to me.

Thanks for the input.
