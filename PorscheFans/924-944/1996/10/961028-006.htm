I have a question about motor mounts for the 944 Turbo.  My '87 Model is =
due for a motor mount change and I have started to look for the best =
replacement mounts.  The Porsche dealers have the mounts for about $110 =
each but one supplier in Atlanta has what they call the 'Club Sport' =
Mount for $145 each.  They say these are better.  Does anyone have any =
experience with the 'Club Sport' mounts and are they any better than the =
turbo mounts? Or are they the same thing as the turbo mount, just with a =
different name?

In a related question, Is there any danger in running the car for a =
while with worn mounts? I have only experienced the vibration for a few =
months, and I only drive the car on the weekends. The Porsche dealer =
says the mounts are 'collapsed' and need to be replaced since this puts =
stress on the other components.  I assume that the 'collapse' is from =
the fluid leaking out, although I thought the Turbos had better mounts =
than the standard 944s and none of the fluid.  Anyhow, do I really risk =
any damage if I run for a while before I replace them?  The vibration is =
not that bad, and is worse when cold or the A/C is on but it is =
experienced only at idle.  The only determiental behavior I have =
experienced is some vibration when launching from a start, especially =
when cold - the engine vibrates a little worse.  I have to slip the =
clutch a bit sometimes to avoid the vibration, but the clutch is OK - =
saith my authoized Porsche dealer.  Anyway I figure I can replace them a =
little cheaper than the $500 figure the dealer quoted.

Thanks to the list members who gave me advice on how to replace the =
mounts.  Your experience and advice is greatly appreciated.

Thanx,
J. Dean Roberson
