          Well, the 968 Turbo (really called the 968 Turbo S) was in fact
the 968's 3 liter engine, but it used the 2valve head from a 944 Turbo.  The
output was around 305 horses.  This is a street legal car, but the real one
you want to look for is the 968 Turbo RS (330 horse) race version.  And they
were both SINGLE turbo engines.

The problem (with 944 and 968 Turbos) is that they are faster than all the
911s. That is why Porsche detuned the 951, and doesn't even make a 968T.
Porsche could have slapped that $50 chip in to give it 300hp, and make it
able to blow a Carrera off the road, but NO WAY in HELL they'd do that!

But I'm sure the larger displacement of the 968T as opposed to the 944T put
its performance in a whole new class.
