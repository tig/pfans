Jerry,
This fellow (if he's the same one I'm thinking about) drove to our Summit
Point event in September.  Beautiful RUF turbo.  He blew the turbo at the
event and I had to tow him home.  He was real happy that some people do tow
to events...  And I must say that his RUF looked mighty nice behind my
truck on the highway, I could get used to that...   :-)
