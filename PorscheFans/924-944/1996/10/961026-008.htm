In reply to Ken's question about the 944 power steering, the Porsche 85.5
944 factory brochure states: 

"When the front wheels experience maximum torque then the full hydraulic
[steering] assistance becomes effective.  The amount of force necessary to
steer when driving slowly and when parking is limited to a comfortable
value.  With increasing engine torque, the steering oil pump ensures that
the power assistance is reduced slightly.  When driving fast into corners,
it automatically adjusts to the lower torque produced.  This level of
assistance gives comfortable steering and at the same time ensures exact
feedback on the condition of the road and the performance of the vehicle.
When driving straight ahead and with low torque, the power assistance works
without hydraulic support as with mechanical steering."

In other words, it appears that 944 power steering is *not* speed sensitive
as such, but compensates in such a way as that impression could presumably
be gained.

Battery at the rear:  I don't know about left hand drive models, but my RHD
86 951 has the battery in the left rear storage compartment in the luggage
compartment.  Moving the steering column over for RHD resulted in too little
depth in the engine bay for the battery on the right side, and of course the
left side is occupied by the fuse box.

Re:  Capt. Squid's Parts and Technical Reference Catalog, Water Cooled 924,
944, 928 Models 1977-1988, # PNA 000 147 A.  Anyone know a friendly PCA
dealer who'd be willing to send a copy airmail to Australia on receipt of
credit card details etc. etc.?  I suspect (but have yet to check) that this
item won't be so readily available over here!
