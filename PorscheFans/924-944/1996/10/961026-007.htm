Hi P Fans,

Fazaan had asked how I blew the head gasket on my 87 951 and why I was going for
the total rebuild.  Figured I would post my answer as I usually write better if
I have a perceived audience. 

 From what we can deduce, the engine was running too lean (plugs were white)
thus causing detonation (knock sensor did not save me)and hence goodbye #4
cylinder.  One too many power runs may have caused the inter cooler to become
heat soaked thus adding to the lean problem.  We were running colder plugs, Cup
Car turbo, chips, Power Box (putting out 50 to 70 pounds of fuel) and the boost
valve set at 15 pounds or 1 bar.  The fuel curve was probably not rich enough.
It is my understanding, with the increased boost and chips, the injectors need
to stay open almost continuously during high RPM.  This is why I will probably
go to a Turbo S DME and splice in a multi spark MSD unit.  This is beyond my
limited knowledge so my engine builder will figure out the final set up.

I towed my car to the shop but  the Porsche doctor had other patients (mostly
non- german) jamming his shop. The doctor was kind or devious enough to let me
start pulling the head in his shop after I got off work.  Armed with the
knowledge that the anti-freeze would etch the cylinder walls if it remained too
long, I laid my first serious wrench on the Porsche.   As an over the hill
desert motorcycle racer, I had turned a wrench or two on, what I thought was, a
wide variety of iron.  Just how difficult would it be to pull a Porsche head?  I
found out.  I took far longer than I thought I should (the 6 1/2 hour flat rate
is a joke the first time) and had to ask for help too many times.  I both
admired and cursed the German engineering at the same time.  What I considered
to be a complete tool box turned out to be not so complete.  Now I know why
there are flex head ratchets, wobble extensions and thin wall universal sockets,
thank you Porsche.

Finally, I had the head off.  Bad day at Blackrock, two of the cylinders walls
were scored.  The "Master", as I was now calling him, indicated the engine would
have to come out and then pointed out several microscopic grease specks that I
had missed when I cleaned the floor of my work area with shop rags for the
umpteenth time.  Did I mention that shop rags cost $.18 each to be cleaned?

Pull the engine?  Dollar signs flashed before my eyes, then the Master said I
had better get started and walked off.  Decision time, if I killed the Master,
no court in the land would convict me, but I would have no one to put this thing
back together.  I already have another toy (P-1800 Volvo) tucked away that has
been awaiting restoration for the last ten years so that was not an option.
What to do?

 What did I want?  The answer was obvious, the same thing most Porsche owners
want, more POWER.  My friend  has a S2 that is great off the line and through
midrange but does not have the top end turbo rush.  The answer, of course, was a
3.0 liter turbo!  Try and find a 3.0 or short block in California that they do
not want a king's ransom for.  This was before I knew about George B., he
probably has his warehouse full of them.  The 3.0 was out.  

A call to Andial about their stroker kit brought on more sticker shock.  A S2
3.0 crank, special Mahle pistons and Carello rods listed at $5800 with wholesale
dealer at four thousand something.  The stroker was out.

Enter the Master.  The master indicates he could design liners and have pistons
forged for less than the cost of the Mahle pistons.  He could have a crank
billet ground if we could get a copy of the 3.0 blueprint.  Just try to get
anything out of Porsche.  Flush another idea.

I start throwing out feelers.  A German importer friend contacts his sources in
Germany and gets crank and piston prices higher than we were quoted here.
Scratch going direct.

Bingo!  My Net classified ad on the Porsche Owners Page (free) brings a new S2
crank for $1600.  The Master checks it out and has it Magna-fluxed, I buy it.
Now engine removal takes on a new meaning.  Blood, sweat, grease and parts fly
in all directions.  Once again, I'm on my hands and knees cleaning up balls of
grease, the rag bucket overflows at $.18 each.

The Raceware studs and wide fire ring head gasket were delivered.  The gasket
was measured and matched to the liner design.   We originally considered
O-ringing the block or head, but received a different story from each shop that
did the work.  The general consensus, and my builder agreed, was that stainless
O-rings worked best with the aluminum head and block.  However, our cast iron
liners would require copper O-rings for a softer crush. The problem we found
with both the stainless and copper O-rings was there was a wide variety of
opinions as to O-ring diameter, groove depth and radius.  One engine builder of
850 hp 3.8 liter racing engines uses a custom Felpro head gasket with a built in
O-ring.  He indicated if we went up in cube and compression, we would blow the
gasket without the pressure ring. The Master then decided to design the liners
to sit a few thousands above the deck of the block to act as a pressure ring
against the head and gasket. The liners will be fusion bonded to the cylinder
walls with a special heat transferring adhesive, none of that interference fit
stuff for us.

The engine was finally out, through the bottom I may add.  The Master's attempt
to pull the engine out the top was foiled by an unmovable crank pulley bolt (had
to be heated) and a hidden bolt on the clutch housing.  Score one minor point
for the apprentice.  The Master now pulled the engine apart in a flash after I
had done all the real work.  The skirt on #4 piston showed abnormal wear, two
cylinder walls were scored (cause unknown), the exhaust valves were shot, the
oil rings were gummed up (70,000 miles with the oil changed every three to four
thousand ???), my upgraded (40,000 miles on it) clutch was shot, two pressure
plate bolts had to be drilled, the head studs had to be heated and cranked out
with a big wrench but everything else was in good shape.

The eight week wait for the custom J&E pistons is probably just as well.  The
technical data my builder requires is difficult to obtain.  Anyone have an in at
the factory?  During the wait, he has ported, polished and milled the head, port
matched the intake, fabricated an adjustable cam gear on his milling machine,
measured the head volume to figure the final compression ratio (8.5 or 9 to 1,
still up in the air) and checked the stroker crank with the stock rods (looks
like with a bit of machining on the girdle, we can save the cost of custom
rods).

To answer the question "why go the whole 9 yards?".  There are thousands of 951s
tooling around but only a handful of 2.8 951s.  This is a chance to have an
almost one of a kind engine in a car I really enjoy (rationalize the cost).  I
am having a great time doing part of the research and mechanical work.  There is
really no way to attach a price to having a smile on your face when you are
driving (rationalize the cost).  Driving anything else that I have or can afford
is not the same as the Porsche.  "It is not the destination but the journey"
(probably written by a Chinese Porsche owner attempting to rationalize the
cost).
