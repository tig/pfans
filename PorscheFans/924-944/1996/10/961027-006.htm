>To start with, it leaks engine oil. Is it possible to replace oilseals
>(front engine (crank) seal, rear engine seal, etc) without
>taking out the engine?

Yes, they can all be done with the engine in the car.  Which does not
mean that the job is particularly easy.  To do the front seals, you will
need to buy the workshop manual set and the tensioning tool for the cam
timing belt and the balance shaft belt.

Check your power steering fluid level.  Typically, this is a sign that it
is low, or that you have a clogged hose, or perhaps a slipping V-belt.

Sorry, automatic transmissions are a thing of mystery to me...

There are two cone-headed bolts which stick out from the bottom of the
window and engage in the rear valence to lock the window down.  Their
length is adjustable.  First loosen the jam nut on each bolt.  Then adjust
the bolt until the hatch still engages, but does not have free play when
you press down on the rear spoiler.

You should also lubricate the jaws in the rear valence which engage these
bolts.  They can stick open, and as such will not engage the bolt and allow
the hatch to rattle.  Also lubricate the hinges at the top of the window
with a penetrating lubricant like Wurth HHS-2000.

>I'm using unleaded fuel at the moment (octane 98). I've been told that on
>these old cars leaded fuel will give me
>longer valve lifes. Is this true and should I switch to leaded fuel?

No, it's not true.  Leaded fuel will also poison your catalytic converter
if you have one.  Bruce Anderson checked the valve seat hardness of 356's
some time ago, and found that even these old cars have sufficiently hard
valve seats that leaded fuel is unnecessary.  I have never seen a 944
with valve seat recession.

>Most of the time my turnsignal works fine, but there are moments that it
>does nothing! Do I need to buy a new one or
>is it possible to take it apart and clean or fix it?

Probably a problem with the switch in the steering column.  But I'd get out
a multimeter and chase down the problem.

>Where can I get some more info on the car? A good maintenance manual, a FAQ,
>etc.

Depends what you want to know.  I'd invest in a factoru workshop manual
set, paper or microfiche as suits your taste.

>Does anyone has any experience with their parts, is it good quality or
>should I just stick with original Porsche stuff?

One big advantage buying parts from Porsche is that they come with a two-
year (I think) guarantee.  If a bad oil filter ruins your engine, Porsche
buys you an engine.  You don't get that kind of guarantee from any after-
market supplier.  Having said that, though, I've had very positive
experiences with Automotion.
