Hope I'm not boring people with stuff that will never change...

Does this mean that the 3.0L block is not the same block as the 2.5?  I'm under
the assumption that the same block was used throughout the series.  Only bore
and stroke were increased, not the actual engine block.  In '89 the 944 had
2.7L of displacement, the 944s2 had 3.0L displacement.  The 944 had a larger
bore (over the 2.5), the 944s2 had same bore as the 944, and a longer stroke.
 It seems that it would have been more cost efficient for Porsche to simply use
the 944 and 944s2 block (2.7L, to gain 3.0L the 944s2 had an increased stroke),
instead of having to bore out two different sizes into the blocks.

(the 968 may have used another engine block)

Yes, and extra valves let the engine drink...

Agreed, there were quite a few variations of the 944 line.  However I am
curious, why did the price jump dramatically from '85 to '89.  There was an
~$15000 dollar price increase through out the line.  That virtually made the
car uncompetitive in the small engine sports car market  (unless you really
wanted a PORSCHE).  I don't think the car reflected a $15000 change from '85 to
'89.  (but I love the car anyway)

Do the conditions of Germany and the U.S. throughout that time justify the
price increase?
