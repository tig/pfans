Mark, tried mailing you, but it didn't go through... :(
anyways was wondering about the manuals:

Are they any good?  I.e. by flipping through them do you get a sense
that there is some good info in it?  I know that the Haynes are pretty
lame, but how are these chiltons?

Might be interested in the 911 book and the 356-911 book, as I have
a 69 911 w/73 2.4 engine in it....

Charles

My apologizes to anyone who didn't want to see it....

Update on my 86' 951:

Did weld my exhaust (myself) and its MUCH quieter, the 1/4 manifold
was split on the seam, the 2/3 was cracked half way around on the
base of the "Y" of the manifold, wow!, no wonder it sounded like a Harley. :)

This weekend , front seals, races, waterpump, and misc., bleed brakes ...
and off she goes !!!!  -finally-
