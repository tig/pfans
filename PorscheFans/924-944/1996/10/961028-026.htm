Depends on how lucky you feel.  I wouldn't dream of doing it without the tool,
but I'm funny that way.

Most common leaks are from the two hoses as they enter the P/S reservoir.
Replace the solid band factory clamps with "Zebra" clamps, preferably with
rolled edges that won't cut the hose over time.  Porsche recognized that a
mistake had been made here and offered the clamps per a tech bulletin.

There is also a similar hose clamp on a banjo fitting on the P/S pump.  Same
problem, same solution.

Finally, the P/S pump will itself leak.  There is a big o-ring between its
case halves which is serviceable, if you can find a new o-ring.  If this is
the case for you, I'd ask Jay Pineau whether he can help.  He rebuilds
water pumps and advertizes in Panorama.

Yes, you need a reader, and that's something of an investment.  Some people
prefer the fiche to paper, a matter of taste.  Some people gets the parts
fiche as well, which isn't available on paper.  With respect to buying the
manuals, shop around.  I'd call your local dealership parts guy and ask what
price he'll sell them to you -- you might be pleasantly surprised.  When the
manuals come from PCNA, they come fully stocked with the supplements.  From
the aftermarket, you take your chances.
