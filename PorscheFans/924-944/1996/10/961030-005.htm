The dust shield is manufactured and shipped with that split in it.

Jay Pineau will rebuild your core pump for you, so that you don't have to worry about
improper substitutions. His ads are in Panorama and Excellence.

A simple procedure is to prime the oil pump with oil through the filter flange hole.
You can then crank the motor with the DME disconnected, until the oil pressure comes
up to normal.

Good Luck!
