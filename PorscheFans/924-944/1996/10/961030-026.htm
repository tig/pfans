Hi List,

The wisdom of the list has spoken, and I wish to thank *all* the kind folks 
who replied to my recent "Winter Car?" letter.  The responses were so much 
alike I thought I would post the results so you could read them...  As it's 
non-P-car, I will be brief.

- The Beemer is a *bad*, *bad* winter car.  Shame on me for considering it...  
It is light in the pants (rear end), and heavy in the nose.  Spontaneous 
snow-360s have been reported on many major and secondary roads. ;-)

- The Audi Quattro was mentioned in 3 responses as a great car for winter.  I 
neglected to mention that I'm in upstate NY (many many inches of snow), and 
travel frequently to DownEast Maine to visit family (many many inches of 
snow).

- A few folks suggested putting snow tires on the Porsche and driving it this 
winter.  But, with the amount of heavy salting here in NY, and the copious 
amounts of pea-gravel they use in Maine, I would do a *lot* of damage to my 
paint and alloys if I were to do that.  My Ford Explorer (sold last spring), 
went through 2 windshields last year due to stone chips.

- Final assessment?  Audi Quattro or small 4x4 pickup.

Special thanks to Leonard Laub, Rodney Wiggins, Jeff Trang, Marvin Debeque, 
Steve Verona, and Tracy Nelson for your helpful replies.
