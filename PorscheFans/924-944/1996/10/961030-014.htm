Farzaan -

	I first switched to a K&N replacement air filter, and I believe it was
worth 5-8 hp.  The sound was no different.   The MAF came with a cone filter
which replaced the stock induction setup.  I did not notice any difference in
sound that I would attribute to the MAF.  The K27 and associated wastegate
sounds are certainly different, more noticeable, and (I believe) a pleasure to
hear.  I don't believe the MAF into a stock turbo would sound noticeably
different, but I'm not sure.  My mechanic noticed a significant
seat-of-the-pants power improvement at the high end with the MAF (20+ HP?)
connected to the K27.

	The MAF is an easy install (relative to a new turbo), so you may want to
try it out before switching your turbo.  I have heard that the MAF should also
improve low-RPM performance, but I can't verify that because I changed my Turbo
before the MAF.

	As always, suspension mods offer more bang-for-the buck if you are
looking to improve lap times on a road course.  I would not recommend the K27
for autocross.

	My current frustration is the tall gearing for the tracks I drive (Lime
Rock and NHIS).  Larger tires (275/40 17's) lengthen the gears by about 4%.
Some turns are too fast for second and too slow for third (NHIS) and too fast
for third but too slow for forth (Lime Rock).  951's can generate 300+ HP, but
at 2.5 litres we give up some engine flexibility relative to the larger motors.

Good Luck,
Mike Woodward
