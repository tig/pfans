Hi List,

You may recall several messages from me in the past complaining about the 
response of my 944S.  It was a D  O  G!  (Canis Major).  The symptoms were 
*very* slow takeoff from a standing start, requiring feathering of the clutch 
and gas, inability to accelerate quickly or to pass even slow-moving traffic, 
and unsteady acceleration, punctuated with surges and hesitations at 
approximately the same RPMs in every gear.

Steve Travis, another list member, sent me his Air Flow Meter and I had it 
installed today.  What a difference!  The car, while still relatively weak in 
low-end torque, climbs very quickly from 2,000, and really hauls from 3,000 to 
6,500!  At the very least, passing is now an option... ;-)

Next, I'm taking out my DME and shipping it to Steve Chatfield so he can test 
the curves and reprogram in any modifications I want...  Hmmmm.  He offered 
this service for ~$100.
