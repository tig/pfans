Yes the 3.0 Liter and the 2.7 Liter motors have a bore of 104mm, vice 100mm for the 
2.5L earlier cars.  Radically different block, completely different in the buttressing
of the cylinder walls, near the crankshaft.

Using the 3.0 liter crankshaft to stroke a 2.5 liter motor to 2.8 liters without changing
the bore is one improvement that is being made around the country for some club
racers.
