NOT! Actually I am hoping for answers to a idle mystery. 

The scene, Monday a cold and rainy day, I drove to work. My 951 sat in the
rain all day. That evening when I started it, I noticed it the idle was
rough. I drove home, nine miles, I noticed the idle was smooth. 

The clues, when first starting cold, the car idles slowly. On the Tach there
are three ticks before the 1. I assume that each tick represents 200 RPM and
that the tach starts at 400. Cold it idles between the first and second
tick, say 500 to 600 RPM fluctuating roughly. The boost gauge is also
fluctuating just off the first tick. After 5 minutes or so the idle will be
between 600 and 800 and much smoother. After 20 minutes it idles at just
under 1000 say 900 or so, smoothly. After the warm the fluctuation of the
boost gauge is barely perceptable.

Another clues, that it will not show more than slightly past the 1st tick
beyond 1 on the boost gauge no matter what. Before the problem boost would
go up to a tick or so below 2! 

My summary, the problem started suddenly. It was cold and rainy. It is now
cool and clear. The idle is rough and surging at first, then smooths out. It
doesn't generate normal levels of boost.

My first thought was Oh No! the motor mounts are gone. Now I'm thinking a
vacumm line, but if it is a vacumm leak why does it smooth out. Does the
computer take over after it warms up making the best of whatever is wrong?
Also why the diminished boost? Please solve this mystery. Your help will be
much appreciated.
