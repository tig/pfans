Doesn't matter as far as the hydraulics are concerned, since the clutch
is fed by a separate line from the reservoir.  BTW, to contradict what
Barry said (sorry!), you can get a 7 mm wrench on the bleeder w/out
removing the starter.  However, there's a large, unfused +12 line going
to the starter -- be careful or disconnect the battery first.

Sometimes new belts will make this noise for a while, sometimes they
will make it forever.  Be sure that it's the belt, and not a bad roller or
overtensioned belt; get your mechanic to give it a listen if you're not
sure.
