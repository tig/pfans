Hello list,

Warning...  Warning...  Non-Porsche content detected ahead...

I have to put my 944S funwagon away for the winter soon, and I need another 
car to drive.  I'm looking at a BMW 325 and was wondering if any of you could 
help me out (read: talk me out of it if I am being stupid).

I just need a winter vehicle, nothing fancy.  But I don't want a maintenance 
problem either.  It's a 1987 325 with 107K miles and an impressive sheaf of 
maintenance paperwork.  It looks like the oil was changed very regularly, the 
timing belts were done, at least at 60K and 80K, and it was basically 
maintained in a very proper manner.  (Although that many maintenance papers 
makes it look *expensive* to keep one of these cars on the road, even moreso 
than my Porsche).

Do these cars have the same problems as my 944S?  Anything particular to them?

Aside from some repaint work on the rear (I can find no evidence of a 
collision), the paint is repeeling a bit, but it looks, runs, and drives very 
solidly.  I will, of course, have it pre-purchase inspected by a different 
dealer if nobody steps forward to tell me I'm being stupid.

Thanks in advance for any feedback!
