Has anyone done a 3.0l conversion for the 951?  From looking at specs,
the 951 has always had the same 2.5l engine (for U.S. import).  I'm
curious for the reasons *not* increasing the engine size for the turbo.

The first increase in engine displacement occured with the 944s.
Porsche increased the bore of the engine by .2l to a total of 2.7l
(I don't have the exact bore and stroke measurements with me).
For the 944s2, the stroke was also increased .3l for a total of
3.0l of displacement.

For a 2.8l conversion, the stroke is increased to the 944s2 specifications.
Usually the 3.0l crank is used in this conversion.

Since I don't know the exact specifications of the aluminum engine block
used, I don't know how strong the block is.  (is it able to handle the
additional power given by an increase in bore for the turbo?)

It seems to me, it would have been easier for Porsche to manufacture
blocks and heads with the same specifications as the 944 as for the 951.
(so they could share the same engine, even though it basically is the
same engine, only bigger for the 944(s(2))).

Any comments or opinions on the preceeding are welcome.

(actually I'm asking for any speculations on why Porsche stuck with the
old engine dimensions for the turbo)

thanks
