I'm not sure what you are saying is correct:  I'll investigate further, to be
sure, but what gave me the idea of doing this was that deionized water is what
we use when we hydrostatically pressure test large aluminum alloy vessels, to
*prevent* corrosion resulting from the water.  The water I used was produced
through a process that involves forcing it through a resin bed.  I'll get back
to the list with some answers probably next week.
