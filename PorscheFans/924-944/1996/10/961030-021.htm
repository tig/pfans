"-Although this is not as timely as it might have been 12 years ago, my
preventive for a repeat of the corrosion problem is to make up the
coolant using deionized water (non-conductive).  "

Hey, I've got to let you know that you should never use deionized water
with anything metal.  For filling your radiator, use either distilled water, or
water that has been put through reverse osmosis.  De-ionized water has
had the ions removed, and thus is 'hungry'.  That is, it has an affinity for
metal ions.  If you put it into your cooling system, it becomes re-ionized,
and the ions are coming from your engine block.  If you don't believe me,
use a turkey baster to put some of your recently replaced coolant in a
clean glass and check the resistance with a multimeter.

Just FYI,
