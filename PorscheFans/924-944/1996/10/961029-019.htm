Wierd ! Herman goes bananas :)

Could it be that the segmented contacts in the headlight motor
have shifted slightly loose on-axis? I am talking about the
thingummy that provides run-juice to the motor throughout
mid-travel. So when the motor reaches the end of its travel, it
does not kill itself off like it is supposed to but keeps going
and going and going ..?  (Egads! The Eveready bunny has
infiltrated this Porsche!)

Or, another theory -- does the 3-5 mins coincide with something
else in the car turning itself off ? Perhaps a courtesy light,
or perhaps the thermostat driving the fans ? OR are you
frantically jiggling the light switch during the time ? (Dont do
that, and see if the bunny keep going on and on). If so, then I
hypothesise that a short ckt or loose wire is passing kickback
juice to the start-contacts in headlight motors on the sly.

Maybe, Unplug headlight motor harness at the motor. Hot wire
"the appropriate pins" on the motor to battery to test motor
behaviour. You *will* need a detailed ckt diagram to do this
kind of a thing. And watch that motor, it can turn on without
warning whilst you are fiddling about.

Any other theories ?

Best of luck on this one. I am curious to know what the real
diagnosis turns out to be.
