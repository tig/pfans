Here is my two cents on this topic, a buddy of mine bought a 1996
carrera 4S this summer. He took me for lunch and asked me to run it
through a few gears and give him my opinion. After testing it out he
proceeded to tell me that he wasn't very happy with it.  I looked around
at the car (black on black - $115,000 Canadian) and asked him how in the
world was it possible not to be happy with his car. His reply - "two
weeks ago a buddy of mine bought the same car you have (944 turbo S -
albeit it his is chipped and mine isn't) they raced and my buddy with
the new Carrera 4S LOST!
I must say that I spent the next few minutes chuckling. BTW, he got rid
of it.
