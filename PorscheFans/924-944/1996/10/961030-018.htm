Darren Foo asks

>	OK, so what's the fastest way to get a start from 0? I don't wanna
drop my clutch knowing that a 2000 dollar transmission replace moves
up by another half a year each time I drop it. Thing is... without
dropping the clutch the engine bogs really badly... My friend says
something about slipping the clutch right at friction point... But
I'm still way to scared of that enormous bill... I know many of you
are autocrossers... how do you get good starts? A good start must be
even more important on a roadrace... if it's not rolling...

Exact technique varies from car to car. Basic idea is that you want the
engine to be developing enough torque to spin the tires A LITTLE; big engined
American cars have so much torque that they will break the tires loose at
will, and you will just sit there making big clouds of white smoke. So for
them, you hold revs at anywhere from 1200 to 2000, then pop the clutch and
simultaneously floor the throttle. Some wheelspin. 

For most cars, you want to hold them at max torque rpm, pop clutch and floor
throttle all the way. Done right, the clutch should not be slipped. Clutches
should be in or out (OK, so we slip them a bit in street driving; that's a
different story). Clutches should not be slipped because they're expensive to
replace. Tires should take the slip because they're basically disposable.
When launched at the right rpm, you should see the revs hold steady briefly
as the tires slip, then pick up and go toward redline. If you picked too low
an rpm, the revs will drop when you engage the clutch. If you picked too high
an rpm, the revs will climb immediately as the tires break loose too much. 

Forget trying this with any 4wd car. You will probably toast the clutch. I
heard that the rocket scientists at some magazine, uh, Red Track? destroyed a
993 Turbo that way. 

Turbos -- turbos don't make torque unless they're on boost. So holding them
at a constant rpm and then popping the clutch won't work. For those, I floor
the throttle from idle and step off the clutch quickly (but not sidestep the
pedal) when I reach the desired launch rpm. Again revs should pause
momentarily at that rpm before climbing, as the tires slip. For the 911 Turbo
this rpm is surprisingly low, about 3500. 

Holding the car on the rev limiter and then popping the clutch is 1) slow and
2) expensive. But some magazines test that way. (It's not their 'expensive').

I just drove the Boxster. That car has 1) such wide rear tires, 255/40 x 17
on this one, and 2) such a high peak torque rpm, that I launched it at about
5500 rpm in the best of the three quick attempts I made. Done that way, it
spins even those big sticky tires enough to lay 15-foot patches of rubber.
Given more time, I would try to bring that rpm down to 5000. 4500 is too low,
it bogs.

Note that all of these techniques are intended for competition only. If you
do this every time, you will wear something out. Done occasionally, at
slaloms or races or such, you should be OK. With some test cars, I have done
dozens of starts in this way with absolutely no sign of  any clutch problems.

>Thing is... without dropping the clutch the engine bogs really badly...

Use higher rpm. 


>My friend says something about slipping the clutch right at friction
point... 

For this sort of thing, clutch should be in or out, not slipping. THAT'S
where the wear comes in; clutch slip = heat = glazing and wear. If it can't
slip, it can't get hot. For lower-torque street driving, the slip is not a
problem.
