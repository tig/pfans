I have found that a van has been most conveneint for several reasons:

1) THey don;'t hold their value very well, so you can pick one up used

2) They have ALOT more space than a pickup or suburban

3) You can haul large metal objects, plywood, furniture, and thereby
convince the wife that it's a great investment, so you can pick up
building supplies

I would have NEVER concidered a van.  A freind in the club replaced his with anew and offered me first crack at his, so I offered him much less than I thought he'd take and I was wrong.  SO I had the van.  Set up for towing, 351C, etc. set me back $1200.

Now I really don't mind driving it.  And It's a handy place to sleep when it's too 
dark or rainy to pitch a tent!
