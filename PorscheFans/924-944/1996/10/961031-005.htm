     I had a BMW that had a similar problem.  The dealer replaced the fuel 
     injectors (it was a long time ago, I think it was the injectors).  
     After replacement the car started instantly.  How are your injectors?
     
     I don't know if you have a problem though.  Seems to me a lot of 
     things could contribute to the slower starting syndrome, but I would 
     only worry if this is symptomatic of a component slowly failing, or 
     de-tuning.  If this has been this way since you got the machine, and 
     there is no degeneration in running over a long period of time (how 
     long have you had it?), then I would not worry.
     
     As for any benefits; yes it might help prime the oil pump.  Some 
     people I have heard talk about adding a pre-lube oil pump (electric I 
     think) to circulate oil before ever starting the car.  I never heard 
     of one on a Porsche, but it seems like a good idea.  Most of the wear 
     on an engine is during the first few seconds of starting.  After that 
     the wear is much much less when running under normal conditions.

Marvin, my 951S always turns over 4 or 5 times before it fires up. My 84 
944 fired up immediately. I've been trying to find a way to have my 951S 
fire up right away (new plugs, cap, rotor etc). From what you've posted 
is it better that it turns over several times first? Should I leave it 
the way it is?
