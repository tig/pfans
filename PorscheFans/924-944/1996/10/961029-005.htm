The 3.0L block is supposed to be able to go up to 3.2 to 3.4L but Porsche
thought 3.0 was enough as it was the largest displacement 4-cyl in 
production at the time. The 3.0L engine took Porsche two years to develop
after the 2.5L was perfected.

Jochen Freund, senior project manager for the 944 was quote as saying,
"The turbo engine doesn't need extra valves. A turbocharger makes it
breathe as heard as you want. Two hundred forty seven hp is enough"

The saleability of a larger Turbo engine probably wouldn't have justified
the development costs. This surely would have bumped up the price tag and
944's were becoming expensive. If you think about it, for a relatively
small auto manufacturer, Porsche had quite a few model variations already
in the 944 line.
