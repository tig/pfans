Hello Thore, first of all I want to thank you for your reaction.
I really like the way this Internet works. Nice, reactions from all over the
world.

I don't know yet, if the thump is normal, but I think it is not. I've been
told in another
reaction to change the filter and oil of the transmission. I will do this
and will let you know the result.

No, I don't have the clicking noise you are talking about. So don't know
what it could be.
Sure that it is not one of your tires?
I've got some other reactions on the noise made by the hatch:
Lubricate the hinges (penetrating oil or silicone spray), lubricate the
hatch-seal with silicone gell.

In the mean time I did some reading on this. The 944 I own is meant to be
using unleaded fuel,
I don't know about your 924.

I have the Haynes manual, but I'm not satisfied at all with it. 
The faq was sent to me as a response to my questions, nice.

I ran into Tweeks and Performance Products allready on internet. Did not
know about
autoatlanta yet. I'll check them out.

>Good luck with your Porsche! They sure are fun.. :)

Think so too, having a lot of plessure with the car allready, thanks and
luck too.

Regards,

Jurmic
