It's too late. The 944 turbo S blows away all Carerra's except for the 
new 993 models. With the chip, you can still keep up.

The real problem was $$$. The 951S cost more than a 911 (base price
for 951S was $47,432 vs. $45,985 for 911 Club Sport), and people
weren't willing to pay that much money. 

Then in 1990, the Nissan 300 ZX Twin Turbo came out. For much less money
you got 300 horsepower, and less lag. Continue that with progress with
the Mazda RX 7 R1 and the Mitsubishi 3000 GT VR 4, and Porsche saw the light, 
and got out that market.

Fast forward to 1994, and Porsche comes out with a vastly better, faster
and CHEAPER 911, and happy times are here again.

Now Porsche has the last laugh, as the 300 ZX is dead, the RX 7
is almost dead, and none of those cars have held their value as well as
the 944 turbo (which pales in comparison to a 911).

From todays paper:
	Mazda 93 RX 7 R1 twin turbo. 30K miles, mint, loaded, $19,500
	Mazda 93 RX 7 R1 twin turbo. red/tan lea, 34K mi, $18,500
	Nissan 91 300 ZX TT, 29K mi, mint, t-tops, $18,9 or BO
	Nissan 90 300 ZX TT, triple black, mint, $13,900
	Nissan 90 300 ZX TT, pearl white, 5 spd, t-tops, $14,900 / BO
	Mitsu 93 3000 GT a/t, 45k mi $11,900
	Mitsu 92 3000 GT VR 4, 5 sp, loaded, mint, $14K
	Mitsu 92 3000 GT 49K, looks new, $15,500

So there you have it. What was the question again?
