Hal,
The best deck and speakers built now days for Porsche 924-944 are
perfect in every way and definately good equipment.  These are just
suggestions of course but my stereo in my Porsche was purchased and
put in with the help of one of my friends who is first place in the
state of Colorado in car audio, so hopefully you'll trust me on this
one.  
Deck:Pioneer detachable face CD player(all of the pioneer CD players
are very nice and affordable)
Front Speakers:Pioneer 3 1/2in. tweeters
Front Door Speakers:Pioneer 5in. mid range
Rear Speaker 2+2:Pioneer 4x6in. plate
Rear Hatch Subwoofer:Kicker 12in. w/ 6in. horn tweeters
(I recommend building your own box for the speakers to fit the
special shape of the rear hatch in your 944)
Amp:300 watts (doesn't  really matter what company you purchase,
power is power; make sure you wire the deck directly to the battery,
so you don't get such a huge power drain)
With this set up you'll be able to pull up to those punks in their
piece of crap bass mobiles and show them what real sound is!  Good
Luck!
