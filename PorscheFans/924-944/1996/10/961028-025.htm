I and at least one other person recently discovered that BOTH bolts which
hold on the A/C compressor had sheared off, leaving the compressor hanging
by the belt and some friction.  This was enough to cause some serious
vibration, although I don't know if I'd go so far as to call it knocking.
In fact, when I had my system examined (it suddenly stopped engaging), the
guy didn't even notice that the thing was just hanging there!  Replacing
the bolts is a fairly straightforward job, once you get out the old bolt
pieces.  Anyhow, check that before you do anything else.

As for removing the compressor, to do that you have to disconnect the
hoses, which lets out all the Freon.  Double check the wires to the
compressor, to make sure they don't look frayed or something equally
obvious.

There is a good side to all of this-- there's a product out by Pennzoil
called FRIGC which is supposed to be a direct replacement for R-12.  So, if
you're intent on doing things yourself, you might be able to get away
cheaper by using this FR-12 (as it's called) instead of R-12.  Again, this
only applies if you're planning on opening the system, which you probably
shouldn't do if it's still cooling.  Some other members of the group have
used this FR-12 FRIGC and seem to like it.  There's a site on it
http://www.frigc.com

For what it's worth!
