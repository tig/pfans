Yes, it is a simple operation to remove the clutch from the compressor
with the hoses still attached. In fact, you should be able to do it
without unbolting the compressor.

You will find some notches cut into the outside front edge of the
pulley. I braced a length of wood between one of these and the garage
floor to break the pulley nut free. If you don't do something like
that you will have to use a strap wrench or unbolt the compressor
and hang it down to get at the nut with an impact wrench.

There are some large diameter threads cut into the inside of the
pulley. If a large bolt is theaded there it will press against the
compressor shaft and force the pulley off. Sorry, I don't have the
specs on the required bolt at hand. If you don't use a bolt you will
have to use a gear puller and this might require hanging the compressor
to provide enough clearance for the puller.
