I don't know the cause but it happens. While I was working at Porsche, I came
into the parking lot one morning and there was a 924 with the lights going
up, down, up, down, up, down... somebody finally found the owner and they
took care of it. I don't know how, probably pulled a fuse for the time being.
Just out of curiousity, how many others on this list have had this happen? It
does look pretty silly...
