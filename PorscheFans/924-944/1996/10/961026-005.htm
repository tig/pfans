Well, I surely think that God has smiled upon me...Not only did the owner
of the shop that ruined my clutch take full responsibility for the problem,
she has already agreed to pay all costs associated in having it replaced
(read: I don't have to take the time to do it myself!).  I had it towed to
the only Porsche dealership in town on Thursday (it was pretty interesting
getting it out of the bottom level of a parking deck), and work should
begin on Monday.  I was also able to get a signed statement from her
stating that she was responsible and would pay for all damages associated
with the incident.  

I never would have thought that things would work out so well...

Clint
