after reading the last post on motor mounts I dont think I would have 
tried to replace mine based on the length and complexity of the 
directions.

I know for a fact you can simply loosen some of the air filter nuts 
and raise the engine a little bit, "slide" the old ones out and new 
ones in. (raise the engine a little more if fitting the turbo mounts 
in place of out one.)
No removing of the tires, or stearing arms...
the best way to get under it is use a set of metal wheel ramps,
on the top of a driveway with an incline and pull the car out of the 
garage on to the ramps.  The car is still level with the rear in the 
garage, and you can get under the engine with ease and still have 
your floor jack for raising the engine.  ( I'd place a large piece of 
wood inbetween the jack and engine and raise it on the oil pan.)
(DO THIS INCH BY INCH, MAKE SURE THINS ON TOP)
    (DON'T BREAK AND THAT LOOSEN THE THINGS)
                               (THAT MIGHT!)
I've done it this way with no damage to the car and in a single 
afternoon.  (It help to have a friend to watch the top as you raise
the engine)
