Hello Paul,

>engine is running very well but I suspect that it uses more oil than

My 924S has the same problem: Mine uses about 4 liters of oil for a
distance of 1000 kilometers. (I drive every day about 40 kilometers
to work - mostly Autobahn).

Three or four weeks ago i've done a compression test: The compression
values on all cylinders are ok.

Replacing the valve shaft seals did NOT reduce oil consumption, although
the mechanic told me that that they were worn out. (I haven't seen them)

>I would like. I don't have exact measurements yet but what is normal?

The users manual states that 1-1.5 liters / 1000 km are normal. Don't
you own a users manual? Cause we have the same cars i can send you a
paper copy of my *german* manual. (Send me an e-mail if you want a copy).=

Hello P-Fans,

in the spring of 1997 i'm going to buy my 2nd Porsche: a 944 turbo
or 944 S2 (>=3D 1990 model).

I haven't driven one of these cars until now, but i assume that
they 'll feel even more better than my 924S. Because they cost
nearly the same here in germany (~~20,000-30,000 DM), i'm absolutely
unsure if to buy a 944 turbo(250hp) or a 944 S2(211hp).

What are the pros and cons of these two cars compared to each other?

Which of these cars is more susceptible to wear (Average maintenance
costs)? (I expect to use this car as a daily driver)
