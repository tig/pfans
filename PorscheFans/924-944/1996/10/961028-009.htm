Does anyone out there have any experience with a spring centered clutch kit
/ lightweight flywheel replacement in the 944?  I've heard that the reason
that spring centered clutch replacements fail is that the springs do not
have enough clearance from the flywheel bolts, and that replacing the
flywheel with one that has recessed bolts solves the problem.  Does anyone
know?  I'm looking in particular at a kit offered by Technical Dimensions
the has the Sachs spring clutch kit + a lightweight flywheel with recessed
bolt holes...Any comments or suggestions would be appreciated!

Clint
