I certainly have the fastest 944 in my region, but these upgrades have
necessitated a $3000 brake upgrade and 17" wheels to fit the big brakes (another
$3000 for Fikse's).  These upgrades have also necessitated the use of O-rings to
prevent potential catastrophic head gasket failure (I spun on my own coolant at
Lime Rock when the blown gasket pressurized the coolant).

You absolutely cannot beat the bang-for-the-buck of the Autothority Stage II
chip set.  I would upgrade the head studs and head gasket at first sign of
trouble.  With this power (~275 HP), you can easily overpower your brakes.  I
had excessive fade even with cool carbons, racing fluid, and cool-brake ducts.
I never boiled fluid, but I would loose the front brakes almost entirely after a
few fast laps at Lime Rock.  The problem was not as bad at NHIS. The resulting
lack of confidence ruins your fun on the track. The Turbo S brakes are
significantly better (though still no match for big reds w/13" rotors :-)

After the chip upgrade, you should consider brakes, shocks, wheels & tires, and
possibly heavier front springs (250 lb) offset by a heavier duty adjustible rear
sway bar before you go down the path of bigger turbos, expensive mass flow
sensors, o-rings, etc.

I have noticed that when the Big HP upgrades are removed from cars to prepare
them for PCA club racing, the lap times are not affected nearly as much as you
might expect.
 
Good Luck,

When I rebuilt my 944 engine a few years ago, I turned the engine with 
the starter with the coil wire removed until I saw the oil pressure gauge 
react.  I probably should have disconnected the DME to stop the fuel 
injectors, too (thanks George).  While this did circulate some oil 
through the block (always a good thing), but I would not consider this 
"Priming the engine."

When I rebuild my friends Chevy V8 350ci (please forgive me, it's a road 
race engine!), we always prime the block before starting it.  In this 
design, the oil pump is driven by a shaft in the distributor.  Before 
installing  the distributor, we turn the oil pump without turning the 
engine.  We use a shaft taken from another distributor fitted to an 
electric or pneumatic drill motor.  This lets us pressurize the oiling 
system to about 25 psi. It should fill all the oil gallies, journals, 
filter, cool, etc. with oil and get most of the air out.  When you go to 
start the engine for the first time, it turn easier and faster, and the 
oil pressure comes up quickly.  It give you that warm feeling inside 
that all is good.

Given the 944 oil pump design (front bottom of the engine driven by the 
crankshaft), I don't know how you could accomplish the same thing?  There 
are other ways to prime an engine, though.  I have heard that by 
connecting an external pump and oil source at the oil filter location you 
could pressurize the system, but I have no experience with this.
