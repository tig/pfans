     If your starter spins the engine at 800+ RPM you should be able to 
     stop using gas and run your car on batteries!
     
     Ideally I would believe you should hand coat every moving part in the 
     engine prior to starting. However, I disconnect the coil wire before 
     starting the engine after oil has been changed.  Both of my 944 cars 
     will hardly register on the tach. when cranking away.  
     
     There is an advantage to this low speed rotation.  It allows the oil 
     system time to prime and get oil moving.  Even a relatively low 
     running RPM (900 RPM) there is a substantial risk to dry metal parts 
     wearing under this initial start.  Starting the car at idle to prime 
     the oil pump represents about a 10 times faster rotation than the 
     starter motor will generate.  That is 10 times the wear and tear on 
     your engine.
     
     Turning the  car over with the coil wire disconnected is about the 
     best compromise I know of.
