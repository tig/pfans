Pfans, Happy Halloween, 
My p-car (951) has developed an irritating new problem.
The problem started suddenly Monday. It was cold and rainy. The idle is rough 
and surging at first, then smooths out. It doesn't generate normal levels of
boost.

When first starting cold, the car idles slowly. On the Tach there are three
ticks 
before the 1. I assume that each tick represents 200 RPM and that the tach
starts 
at 400. Cold it idles between the first and second tick, say 500 to 600 RPM 
fluctuating roughly. The boost gauge is also fluctuating just off the first
tick. 
After 5 minutes or so the idle will be between 600 and 800 and much
smoother. After 
20 minutes it idles at just under 1000 say 900 or so, smoothly. After the
warm the fluctuation of the boost gauge is barely perceptable.

Also, it will not show more than slightly past the 1st tick beyond 1 on the
boost 
gauge no matter what. Before the problem boost would go up to a tick or so
below 2! 

Could this be a vacumm leak? Oxygen sensor? My first thought was the motor
mounts 
are gone. Why does it smooth out. Does the computer take over after it warms up 
making the best of whatever is wrong? Also why the diminished boost? 

Sorry for the repeat, ;-(
but I need help!
