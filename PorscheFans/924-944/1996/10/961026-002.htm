By belts I assume you mean timing/balance shaft belts.  Judging by the age
of your car and the noise you describe, it sounds like whoever did the
belts didn't check the idler and tensioners.  The noise you're hearing is
bearing noise from the idlers and tensioners.  I recently replaced my own
belts (at 150,000 miles) and the original-style rollers were still there--
and they were all bad, every one.  The easy way to tell is to see if the
tensioner has metal teeth or plastic ones.  The newer tensioners have
plastic teeth and larger diameter bearings, meaning that they'll handle
larger loads better (read: hopefully they'll last longer).  If the person
who did your belts was in a hurry, they may not have even bothered to
remove the tensioners to check them for noise and play.  The grease in the
bearings in my tensioners had completely leaked out and dirt had gotten
past the seals.  The complete set of tensioners is only about $100-- a
small price to pay to eliminate the noise and avoid the possibility of
having one of those bearings seize (and destroy the belt).  The tensioners
and idler rollers are extremely easy to replace if you've got the car apart
to do the belt.

The reason for the noise appearing "all of a sudden" is probably due to the
new belts and proper tension.  Since the old tensioners were under less
load, they made less noise.  Let us know if this turns out to be the case.
Good luck!
