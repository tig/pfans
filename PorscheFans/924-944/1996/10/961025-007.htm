It's 4:00AM  and I get in my trusty 944 Turbo to set off on a fishing trip.
Fire up the engine and turn on the lights. Notice that on the way up the
headlights hesitate and then go all the way up. At that point the engine
dies. Cranks and cranks but will not refire. Start to smell gas so I unload
car and head towards alternative beater. 
I was late so I didn't try to troubleshoot. Thought about it the whole day
while the fish were avoiding me like the black plague. I was sure I knew what
had happened and when I got home I was proven right. 
The prize, if you guess right, is that you will check your 944 and not let
this happen to you.
I'll post the correct diagnosis but I'm sure someone will guess this real
darn quick.
