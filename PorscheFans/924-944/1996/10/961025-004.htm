Doug, the car doesn't lose coolant (thank goodness) so I'll try to bleed
the system again using the pressure technique.

As for the thermostat, I have a pair of snap ring pliers with various
tips but found that the ends of the snap ring are positioned such that
the plier would have to be horizontal and there isn't enough room (I'ld
like to know who the hell installed the thing in the first place. It
seems you should always position the snap ring so you can get at it when
you install the pump). As you've mentioned I had no success in rotating
the snap ring.
Fortunately I'm thinking I won't need to remove the thermostat at this
time, I think  re-bleeding the system will do the trick, but for future
reference it would be nice to know how to replace the thermostat.

TIA
John Lowe
