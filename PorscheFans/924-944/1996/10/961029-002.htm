This is just my opinion so for what its worth..

I have been participating in Driving Events and Club Races for over ten
years. During that time I have driven to every event within a 1000 mile
radius of my home (Philadelphia suburb). The only exception was Sebring where
a bunch of us got some sponsorship and were able to ship our cars. During
that time I only had to get towed home once and that was from Watkins Glen
which is about 275 miles away. I think it cost about $300 for that little
problem. You don't have to be a genius to figure out that it has cost me $30
a year for towing. 
Now how about the cost of a tow vehicle, not to mention its care and feeding
plus insurance. Seems to me you could afford quite a few tows before you'd
approach the cost of a dedicated tow vehicle. 
Then again I get a kick out of driving my Porsche on the road, to and from
the events, plus I can make better time than driving a rig. Sure space is
limited and I drive on Race Tires and sometimes it rains and and... I just
feel it's part of the experience. 
Sometimes the KISS principal has plenty of merit. 
As an aside I know a fellow that bought a RUF Turbo, brand new Blazer or
something similar, new trailer and off he went in style...For about 30 miles
when he lost control on the PA Turnpike, went over a guard rail, and down an
embankment. The only thing that wasn't totaled was the driver and he never
attended another driving event.
Just some food for thought and only my opinion.
