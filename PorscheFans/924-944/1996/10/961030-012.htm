     Subject: Snow <> Porsche fun, alternative = BMW?
     
     Hello list,
     
     Warning...  Warning...  Non-Porsche content detected ahead...
     
     I have to put my 944S funwagon away for the winter soon, and I need 
     another 
     car to drive.  I'm looking at a BMW 325 and was wondering if any of 
     you could 
     help me out (read: talk me out of it if I am being stupid).
     
     I just need a winter vehicle, nothing fancy.  But I don't want a 
     maintenance 
     problem either.  It's a 1987 325 with 107K miles and an impressive 
     sheaf of 
     maintenance paperwork.  It looks like the oil was changed very 
     regularly, the 
     timing belts were done, at least at 60K and 80K, and it was basically 
     maintained in a very proper manner.  (Although that many maintenance 
     papers 
     makes it look *expensive* to keep one of these cars on the road, even 
     moreso 
     than my Porsche).
     
     Do these cars have the same problems as my 944S?  Anything particular 
     to them?
     
     Aside from some repaint work on the rear (I can find no evidence of a 
     
     collision), the paint is repeeling a bit, but it looks, runs, and 
     drives very 
     solidly.  I will, of course, have it pre-purchase inspected by a 
     different 
     dealer if nobody steps forward to tell me I'm being stupid.
     
     Thanks in advance for any feedback!

     Allen,
     
     I used to own a 1987 325. Bought it new from the dealer. I owned the 
     car for two years before trading it in for a used 1984 944.
     
     Although I have had no bad experiences with that car, there are a few 
     things you should consider...
     
     1) The 325 had what was called a Eta motor (the 1986 325e was the 
     predecessor for the 87).  Redline is 4,500 RPM which is not sporty (0 
     to 60 in about 10 seconds), but the engine is designed for torque and 
     long life not acceleration.  This never went over well in the American 
     market and was swiftly replaced by the popular 325i.  If you drive a 
     944S, you may get tired of the 325 with the low rev limit and may wish 
     to consider the 325i.
     
     2) BMWs are wonderful cars on a dry road, but if someone spits on the 
     road ahead of you, you will get tail happy in the wink of an eye.  In 
     the snow I have pushed more of these cars back onto the road for other 
     drivers than any other car I have seen.  I am not sure I did some of 
     those people a favor by doing that.  I learned to winter drive in 
     Buffalo N.Y. and have driven BMW 320i and 325 cars in the snow often.  
     Successful navigation can be easily done with these cars, but you have 
     to understand their limits and work with the car.  I only had one 
     incident where I could not manage a local hill and was forced to park 
     the car elsewhere for the night.  The problem with the 325 is in the 
     weight distribution.  It is heavily biased in the front, not the rear. 
      I suggest adding 50 to 100 lbs of cat litter in the trunk.  Don't 
     pour it into the trunk, keep the litter in the bags!  That litter can 
     also be used for traction if you do get stuck.  Also a good set of 
     snow tires will make a difference.  Watch out for breaking when 
     slippery conditions exist, ABS will help, but mainly when turning.
     
     3) I never had my 325 long enough to see it rust, but I do see a large 
     number of 320i cars with tail rust (the rear shock towers rusted and 
     the front shock towers tend to crack on the 320i).  I believe that the 
     87 cars offer no rust protection like Porsche does with there cars.
     
     4) Maintenance will be higher than a Honda, but it is a better car.  I 
     had lots of little things go wrong within my warranty, but none were 
     serious and my experiences with the dealer were OK.  I do not know 
     about timing belts for the 325.
     
     5) Between the Porsche and the BMW interior space is suited for rear 
     passengers in the BMW, but I have been able to haul incredible amounts 
     of stuff in my Porsche without damage to cargo and car.
     
     6) Depending on where you live and a host of other factors, insurance 
     will be somewhat less, but I never saw much difference in my policy.
     
     Personally, I favor the 944. You can find excellent examples at very 
     reasonable prices.  The weight distribution is better in the winter 
     and rain.  The maintaince is not dissimilar in cost per mile.  I can 
     haul more odd ball shaped stuff in the 944 than I can get in my 
     girlfriend's Dodge Spirit.  On the other hand if you must transport 
     people, the choice is obvious.
     
     Owning two 944 cars (I have one 87 944 as a daily driver and one 87 
     944S as a "Sunday" car) has not been a bad experience.  Both cars 
     together cost me less than a new Honda Accord, and my insurance 
     company (State Farm) has a policy that I can live with (~$1000 / year 
     for both cars).  When the weather is beautiful, I some times wonder 
     why I own two Porsches.  After all, I can only drive one at a time and 
     the 944S is a beautiful car.  However, when the weather turns nasty, I 
     see all of the other Porsche owners driving their daily drivers.  They 
     don't seem to be smiling much. In fact, the look like the rest of the 
     drivers on the road turning the steering wheel (in those cars it is a 
     request to turn).  MI on the other hand, have a grin from ear to ear.  
     Now I know why I have two Porsches.
