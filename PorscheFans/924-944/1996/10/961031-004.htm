Barry Lenoble asks

>I often see this advice given. I don't understand how it helps. If the
motor is spinning without oil pressure, what difference does it make if
the starter motor is spinning the engine, or the engine is idling?
in both cases the engine is spinning at about idle rpm, with no
load on the engine.
What am I missing?

Starter RPM is even lower than idle rpm. 
(Later) never mind, I see George B. caught that too.

Cranking without combustion pressure in the cylinders puts less load on the
bottom end, wrist pin, and main bearings. 
(Later) Doug Donsbach saw that one...

At a swap meet, ever see one of those snake oil salesmen selling some mouse
milk that lets you run your engine without oil? They have some old iron-block
American engine there, usually a cheap straight-6, pounding away with no oil
pan on it. Last time I saw that, I interrupted the guy's spiel, asked "what
happens if I goose the throttle?" and moved my hand towards the carburetor.
Salesman vetoed that idea real fast... <g>. Because the bearings will not
stand metal-to-metal contact at high rpm and high combustion pressure loads.
