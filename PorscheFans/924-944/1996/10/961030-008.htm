     This E-mail concerns my efforts to convert my 1987 944 suspension and 
     breaks to a 1987 Turbo four piston caliper break system and 
     suspension.  Anyone who has traveled this road would be welcome to add 
     their experiences.  I can be E-Mailed directly if desired at: 
     Marvin_L_Debeque@email.whirlpool.com.
     
     The following is part of an ongoing E-Mail with George Beuselinck of 
     944 Ecology...
     
     >>I am in the process of (getting all the parts) upgrading my 87 944 
     >>suspension and breaks to that of the 87 Turbo.  I now have 
     >>everything I need except the rear aluminum trailing arms (spindles). 
     >>I think the Turbo four piston calipers will not bolt onto a stock 87 
     >>rear spindle (still checking).  When I dismantled the parts from the 
     >>donor (Turbo S rear) I had a case of brain fade and did not get 
     >>those parts.  The remains have since been sold and I would like to 
     >>see if you could quote me on a price for a pair.  I would be glad to 
     >>supply the Porsche part numbers if you require, but I forgot to 
     >>bring the microfiche in to work again.
     
     >You are correct. The turbo calipers require turbo trailing arms. The 
     >stub shaft and the hubs are the same.
     
     >Let me know if we can help...
     
     >Good Luck!

     OK, last night I test fitted one of my rear Turbo calipers and its 
     associated rotor. They did seem to fit, but the offset for the caliper 
     relative to the rotor was biased slightly toward the wheel.
     
     That bias could be compensated with two washers (one for each mounting 
     bolt) as spacers between the caliper and the mount of the trailing 
     arms.  I only need to shift the caliper about 1 mm, so I would think 
     that the structural integrity would not be compromised.  Am I missing 
     anything here?
     
     The other difference between the 87 944 and 87 Turbo trailing arms 
     would be the ABS sensor which I do not need for this car.
     
     I understand that there could be things that I have not accounted for, 
     so I am open to your suggestions.  Breaks (and steering) are the two 
     most critical components of any car.  My mission is not to compromise 
     either of those two, but to enhance both.
     
     Thanks,
     
     Marv ('87 944 & '87 944S)
