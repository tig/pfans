No, you don't. Put snow tires on your car and use it this winter! Michelin
make a winter-only (on in late fall, off in early spring) H-rated
(sustained 130 mph) tire called the X M+S 330 which comes in all 15", 16",
and 17" Porsche sizes.

I just got a set in S4 stock sizes and put them on the stock rims (while
meanwhile supporting the car with rims and tires to GTS spec), and am
looking forward to using my car this winter rather than going nuts waiting
for warmer weather (since my Z-rated tires get hard and unsticky when
they're cold, leading to fishtailing even on clear winter days).

Porsches are particularly good at resisting rust; just make sure to rinse
the crud off the undercarriage whenever feasible.

You may wish to change your oil to a slightly lighter weight (consult your
owner's manual) or use a full synthetic oil in standard weight (synthetics
do not congeal when cold as strongly as do conventional oils). Make sure
your battery's healthy. Check your coolant.

Then, go forth and drive! It doesn't take a clairvoyant to determine that
you really don't want that silly little BMW (which isn't much of a winter
car anyway; a VW Golf or Jetta would give much better traction and be at
least as much fun to drive).
