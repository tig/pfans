How sensitive is this throttle switch?

Scenario:

Anal-retentive me is cleaning plastic and rubber engine parts with 
protectorant putting liberal amount on and wiping down.

30 minutes later start car up and go to local restraunt. Hour later 
come out and car hits for just a second and then nothing. Hour later car 
starts without a hitch and I drive it back home.

Second time this has happened, the first happening after a day of 
wet-sanding on the hood. I don't really see how water got down there the 
first time, but this time the car didn't start the next morning.

My biggest fear is that I am going to take this car on a trip soon and 
do not want to be 2000 miles from home,have this happen and not figuring 
out when the car is going to start again if ever...

Can someone give me somes tips on how to trouble shoot this problem? 
Without being able to recreate the problem, I guess I'm screwed. What 
could it be other than the throttle switch? Is it just coincidence that 
moisture was involved both times? 

Regards,
Brent Smith
