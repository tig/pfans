I often see this advice given. I don't understand how it helps. If the
motor is spinning without oil pressure, what difference does it make if
the starter motor is spinning the engine, or the engine is idling?
in both cases the engine is spinning at about idle rpm, with no
load on the engine.

What am I missing?
