The only way to get to those rear speakers is to peel up the lower rubber
seal around the rear quarter windows and pull out the leatherette (or
whatever it is) that covers that lower panel.  That, combined with the
various screws, will allow you to get the panel off.  It's not too tough,
and the rear quarter window doesn't seem to have suffered in my car.  So,
you don't have to actually remove the rubber seal, just push it up a little.

As for radios, I'm sure everyone has a suggestion.  But, depending on your
tastes, your best bet is to plan it all out before you go buying parts.  If
you like a full range (read: you want bass too), you'd better plan on
getting a separate subwoofer since most 4x6 speakers just can't reproduce
the lows that well.  If you're getting a subwoofer, you may as well get a
power amp as well (and this is how it always starts... pretty soon you've
got a nicer stereo than your wife's, which always makes for some
conflict...).  If you've got a power amp, the head unit's power output
doesn't matter, so you can concentrate more on features and a good
signal-to-noise ratio in the preamp area.  Like how the logic takes you
from a simple head unit change to a full system?  The point I'm trying to
make is to plan it out so you don't get caught by surprise when you spend a
lot of money by trying to constantly "upgrade" the sound.  Enjoy!
