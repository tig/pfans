Pardon me for butting in to a non-aircooled section. But I suspect that the
924 pilot is like most other pilot bearings. I heard of, but never used, a
neat trick for getting those out. Squirt a good amount of wheel bearing
grease into the cavity. Drive a snug but not tight fitting drift into it with
a hammer. Gently, don't want to damage anything if it bottoms. The grease
should keep it from touching the end of the crank anyway. The idea is that
you have a hydraulic ram, the grease has to go somewhere, and it winds up
pushing the pilot bearing out. (I don't know how tight the bearing is in this
application). As a drift, unless the pilot ID is an odd size, you might be
able to use an appropriately sized metric bolt from the local auto parts
store. Use a long bolt, cut off the threads, and check it for sliding but not
sloppy fit in the pilot before trying this. If it's too loose, you get a
faceful of grease. Wear goggles or glasses anyway.
