Yes, there is such a tool, known as a pilot bearing puller.

It has three fingers, which are cammed to the inside of the inner bearing
surface by a conical ram, and a couple of fingers that rest on the surface
of the crankshaft or the block, and a screw to pull the bearing out when
you have everything seated.

I bought one from my local tool outlet for about $25...

Of course, it means that I will never have to use it!!!

Good Luck!
