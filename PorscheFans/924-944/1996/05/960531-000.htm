Pete,
   Thanks for the tip on the MSC tools. I called the 800 # yesterday and talked
to Roz about getting the book. Gave her my address (which is in Germany) and 
what company I work for. When I got to my box # she laughed and said that there
was no way it would fit. So I explained that they would hold it in the special 
area for me and put a note in the box. She says the catalog weighs ~ 12 lbs. 
WOW!! Is this thing like the only catalog you'll ever need for tools in your 
entire lifetime :*). Also, wanted to know where I heard of it. Told her the 
internet. She says that there had been a real upswing in requests in the last 
day.
   I was reading the June 96 issue of european car and saw a blip on "Tufoil" 
lubricant. Guinness Book gave them a certificate as the "world's most efficient
lubricant." Claims to make a car so efficient that it can double the life of 
your engine (hm, sounds like Slick 50 stuff). Anybody on the list know anything
about it. This was in the "Parts Counter" section on page 22.
