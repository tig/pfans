Wow. After reading all the trouble, trials, and tribulations people go
through to remove CV Joint bolts, I wonder why Porsche uses those silly
12 point bolts. I'm almost sure it's so some old German Engineer named
Helmet can get his revenge for being assigned to work on the ass end of
the car, when he wanted to work on the head end.

I'm almost to the point where I think it's better to just order 24 new
bolts (at about $1.00 a piece) and then just rip the original ones out 
with a Vise Grips. I mean, time is money. I have a clutch to replace, and 
I don't really want to spend 2 hours cleaning and removing some silly 
bolts when I could be doing something manly, like wresting with the 
exhaust system or trying to remove the torque tube. 

I'm curious, does anyone who had the shop change the clutch have their
receipt? If so, could you look and see if you were charged for 24 new
CV joint bolts, and 9 new flywheel bolts? I can't see a shop wasting
time trying to remove those bolts when they can charge a customer for
new ones, and do it in 1/10 the time. Personally, I would rather pay
for new hardware than have my shop charge me 2 hours labor (at $70
an hour) to remove the bolts.
