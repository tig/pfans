 hi Guys,
 
 I'm thinking very seriously of club racing at Lime Rock in April.
 
 Is this a good idea?

Hi Barry, 
Well you only live once and if you really have a desire now is the time to do
it with one very important caveat: You have to be willing and financially
able to walk away from the wrecked car that could be yours. This doesn't
happen often but it is a definite possibility. In track events most insurance
companies will cover your first incident, at least. If you in a timed event,
that balled up, smoking hunk of rubber and metal is yours if the worst
happens.
Another factor is that each year it becomes more and more difficult to
compete. Even stock cars are being prepped to the hilt. This costs lots of
money. Or, on the other hand be content to be a back marker. I've been doing
Club Racing since it's inception and my times improve each year.
Unfortunately so do everyone elses. It is amazing the technology and money
that is being expended to make a competitive Club Racer. The modified classes
are unbelievable, the stock classes are unreal.
The other factor is the cajones factor. Are you willing to do the downhill at
Lime Rock without lifting? How about with another car beside you? In track
events you can take a lap off here and there. In Club Racing your are doing
your max every second of the weekend. It's exhilerating but exhausting
physically and mentally. 
I don't want to discourage you but just be realistic. Car preparation to make
it Club Racing legal is the least you need to worry about.
Have Fun and if you need any more advice give me a land line.
Regards, 
Jerry (over 20 Club Races- no podiums)
