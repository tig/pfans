Ok, let's have a vote, which one of the following do you think is
giving me frothy, baby poo like oil:

a) oil cooler seals
b) head gasket

Yah, that's not a joke.  I had to add some oil today and opened the little
oil cover and dumped a bottle of redline in there.  When I yanked it out
(it was dark out), I noticed a bunch of gunk on the sides of the nozzle.

I drove it home and popped the hood and pulled the cap to find lots
of froth and basically water mixed with my oil.  I think it's the oil
cooler seals because performance doesn't feel any different and there
really isn't much coolant missing from the reservoir.  I only wish it
was condensation or something from all the cold we've had here.

Oh well, pretty crappy Christmas, but what can you do...  Maybe this
is the big warranty claim I need to make, maybe they'll go for 
getting a K27 since the K26 will surely be toast in a matter of 
months with that watoil going through it.

If it's the oil cooler seals, I will feel pretty stupid since I
thought mine was immune to that because it's a Turbo S.  Oh well,
I can always go back to my old sayings:

"There's nothing that money can't fix, in relation to cars"
"You've got to pay to play"

Have a Merry Christmas all!

Farzaan.
