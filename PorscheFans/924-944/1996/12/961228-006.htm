Depends on the condition. That's about 100,000 miles. If it has been
treated well, that in itself isn't bad, but if it hasn't been
well-maintained, you could end up spending a lot more than the purchase
price on repairs. Take it to a reputable Porsche repair shop and pay
them to go over it with a fine-tooth comb before you buy it. If the
present owner doesn't want to let you do that, run, don't walk, away
from it. Also, ask for maintenance records. If the owner doesn't have
them, it probably hasn't been well maintained.
