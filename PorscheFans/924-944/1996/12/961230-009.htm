Regarding Turbo Lag:

I have two 951's.  One is an '89 with the Autothority Stage 2 set up.  The 
other is an '87 car which has been COMPLETELY converted to Turbo S specs, using 
parts from an '89 which I (unfortunately) wrecked.  The '87 951 has a custom 
set up from John Milledge.  The mods include DME and KLR chips, a higher than 
stock fuel pressure regulator, wastegate shims, and a drilled cycling valve.

Milledge has told me that he believes his set-up is at least as good, if not 
better than the Autothority version from a (head gasket) longevity standpoint.  
I can tell you from a performance standpoint that there is no comparison.  
While the Autothority is better than stock, the Milledge set up is vastly 
superior!  I can even have fun in autocrosses!  Turbo lag is still noticeable, 
but it is very progressive, and comes in even lower than with the Autothority 
set-up.

As an aside, I recently bought a spare center vent assembly for $25 from 
Partsheaven and made a gauge panel for VDO oil temp and boost units.  The 
latter has shown that my car makes about 15.5 psi or approx. 1.1 bar which is 
higher than the factory gauge can read, and perhaps a bit agressive.  I use 
this gauge panel during the "driving season," reinstalling the original unit in 
the Winter.  If you are unsure of the "true" boost your car is making, I'd 
suggest getting the VDO boost gauge.  Even if you only use it as a "service" 
tool, it's only $26.

The Milledge set-up makes more boost than the Autothority kit in my '89 (which 
makes about .8 bar), but I don't think that is why the '87 is more "driveable."  
I'd encourage anyone considering an update to consider Milledge's along with 
Autothority and Weltmeister.  Incidentally, Milledge was the original 951 chip 
supplier to Automotion/Weltmeister back in the Eighties.  Now they use Dinan, 
the famous BMW tuner located here in CA.

One other thing:

several experts have recommended against boost increasing mods which include a 
drilled cycling valve.  I'd suggest anyone with this fear regarding his set-up  
should speak to Milledge and give him a shot at explaining this in technical 
detail.  His basic point (to me) was that it is not an automatic evil, if you 
know what you are doing and how the system works.
