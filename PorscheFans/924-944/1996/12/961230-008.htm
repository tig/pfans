I have read just about everything I can find on control arms.  I have also 
spoken with the folks at Kelly-Moss Racing, OG Racing, Andial and most of my 
Northern California 944/951 compatriots.  Here are a few points I've picked up:

There is a nice letter to the editor from Andial on control arms in the June 
1995 Pano.

The Fabcar arms are clearly the best way to go, if you can afford them.

We haven't seen many (any) catastrophic arm or balljoint failures in Northern 
Cal.  A friend with a very aggressively set up track car broke an arm off at 
Sears Point, but he believes that the break was due to contact with a large 
rock after he went off, as opposed to a failure.  He is still using factory 
arms.  There have been failures in the East.  Some have been very ugly.  I find 
it very strange that the failures have mostly been described in the East.  
Maybe the tracks are rougher, or the cars are lower.  Or maybe it is the law of 
averages.  This is very perplexing.

Kelly-Moss Racing has been selling used Porsche Motorsports (racing version) 
arms leftover from their IMSA/Firehawk programs.  They would x-ray them and 
sell 'em for less than the new price from Andial.  Last time I spoke with Jeff 
Stone (September?), he had one set left.

There is an ever-increasing number of arm/balljoint rebuilders.  After much 
research, I had mine done by Zims.  I cannot afford the Fabcar units, nor could 
I justify spending a grand for new factory parts with unreplaceable ball 
joints.  This was a difficult decision, as my wife is my co-driver, and she 
drives almost as hard as I do.  I can replace the car...  I check my arms 
frequently, and my car is not lowered too much.

It would be nice if the Fabcar parts were less expensive. More like $500-1000 
as opposed to $1800.  Then I could justify them for peace of mind if nothing 
else.

As a side note, I suggest that you inspect the rear bushings and mounting areas 
frequently.  On one of my cars, I discovered significant cracks in the bushing 
rubber, causing excessive play, e.g., dynamic caster change.  My arms are from 
an 89 951 with only 32,00 miles!  After a very fast trip to So. Cal (average 
speed ~93 mph) I got home and found the right arm dangling from just one of the 
rear mounting bolts.  It seems that the nut plates in the body had worked 
loose, and all of the vibration allowed one bolt to completely unthread.  The 
arm was literally hanging by 4-5 turns on one bolt in the rear!  I had a body 
shop affect the necessary repairs, which is when I installed the new bushings, 
which have an updated design.  KEEP AN EYE OUT!  Imagine what could have 
happened if both bolts had let go on the interstate, or worse on the track!

Anyway, if you are looking for Porsche Motorsport arms, I think your choices 
are KMR or Andial.
