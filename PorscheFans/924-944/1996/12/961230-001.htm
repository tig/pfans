Hi Marv,

> What is the magic trick to successfully bleeding all the air out of the
> clutch hydraulics?

When I first started having clutch problems back in June, I hoped it was
just the salve cylinder. So I removed it, took it apart, and put it back
together (it was fine). Then the fun started when I tried to bleed the
system. I have a (not so) Mityvac that I have successfully used for brake
bleeding, so I tried to use that. However, after going through a pint of
brake fluid, the clutch pedal was still stuck on the floor. Then I had
a friend pump the clutch pedal, and after about 3 pumps it came off the
floor. So I guess the vacuum pumps work for changing fluid, but not
bleeding fluid.

It took me three different occassions of having some one pump the clutch
pedal while I opened and closed the bleed nipple before the clutch pedal
felt right again. Like you said, the best position for me was to have
the rear of the car WAY up there. There are two reasons I could thing of
for that to work better. The first reason is that the bleed nipple is on
the rear of the slave cylinder. Having that up high should allow air to
move to the rear, and then get forced out the nipple. The second reason
is that the area in the brake fluid reservoir that feeds the clutch master
is located at the front of the reservoir. I discovered that if the brake
fuild reservoir gets low, it's VERY easy to suck air into the clutch 
hydraulics. And that really does SUCK! So keeping the rear of the car up
high helps to keep the clutch master full.

I think this is the trick. Like I said, I did this, then drove the car.
At first, the clutch was great, then the pedal got soft. Bled it again,
and again it was initially great, and then got a little soft (not as 
soft as before, but not as firm as I like it to be). One more bleeding
session, and it stayed firm.

I don't think a vacuum works as well as some one pressing the pedal
because if there is air stuck some where below the bleed nipple, the
vacuum will just suck fluid through the system, and won't FORCE the
fluid out. Pressing the pedal, on the other hand, will squeeze any
air out of the system, as the piston will force EVERYTHING out of 
the clyinder, and then fresh fluid will get sucked back into the cyl.

Now, if after bleeding, your clutch feels great, and the next day it's
always soft, I think you have to have a leak somewhere. Perhaps in
the plumbing somewhere?

Good Luck,
Barry

P.S. I started work on the clutch yesterday. Got the garage cleaned up
(1 hour) the car up on blocks (another hour), all bolts hit with liquid
wrench and tapped with a hammer, and finally, all grunge cleaned off of
the CV joint bolts (another hour). So, 3 hours of work, and no real 
clutch work done. Also, I just love the factory manual. Step 1, jack
up car and cover fenders. Step 2, remove exhaust system. Step 3, remove
trans, step 4, remove clutch. (I'm being a little more brief than the
manual, but not too much). I sure am glad I have the FAQ and the Hayens
book. Also, I see one CV joint was ripped. And getting the 12 point
allen bolts out is not going to be fun. I just know they are all going
to strip. Then what, using vice grips and a hammer?
