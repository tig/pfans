Try using stock or factory pads, front and rear.  You most likely have
track or racing pads, which are ineffective until warmed up.  Street pads
have a lower temperature range, and should cure the problem.  I don't 
know for sure, but it seems logical that drilled rotors would have less 
braking area, due to the holes.  This could have an effect.

Fix this now!  Your life could depend on it.
