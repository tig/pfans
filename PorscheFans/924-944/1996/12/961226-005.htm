Rather than risk ruining my bearings (if they already aren't toast),
I'm going to get the car towed into Weissach tommorow.  Any hints,
recommendations, etc?  I'll likely be calling a flat bed.

It looks like I caught the oil/water mixture really early.  There is
no frothy stuff on the dipstick and the coolant looks fine.  There is
about 1/10th of a cup missing from the reservoir under what I would
call normal range, so only a bit has passed (unless they've mixed
evenly in which case the level would be the same anyways!).

My instructions to the dealer are going to be "The oil cooler seals
used in the manifold have likely failed on my car.  Or perhaps it's
a head gasket.  Check both and replace as necessary and also inspect the
bearings as per Porsche's recommendations."  That should take care of it
all.  I really don't think there is any damage because I caught it so early.

Farzaan.
