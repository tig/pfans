Subj:    993 alingment tool for rear, also suspension components

993 alignment tool for adjusting and checking the kinematic toe. This tool
replaces the original tool ( $ 2400) versus mine which is made to measure the
angle of the spindle (caster). It is a lot easier to use than the original
tool, compact, just as accurate and most important is that it works on
factory ride height cars as well as lowered or race car height. The other
benefit for the end user is the fact that you won't pay the dealer price. It
sells for $ 400. There will be a flyer available within the next couple of
weeks. Please call to order and for approximate time of delivery.

As far as suspensions go I have 993 Super Cup shocks, all hardware, springs
and upper spherical bearings. Also available for the 944 and 968 with or
without rear coilover. Upper strut mounts that are as good as everything out
there and CHEAPER. 964 3.8 RSR components as well. For all of these
applications I have spherical bearing pivot points for  the suspension. 944
being made now. What I'm
trying to accomplish is to offer some of these components at a better price
for the budget racer or driver ed guy or gal. Please call with your
questions.
