My '82 924 fires at once when attempting to start after the car had sat for
several hours and the engine is cold. But, it will only run for about 10
seconds then dies from lack of fuel. The car can be instantly restarted, for
another 10 seconds or so. While the engine is running I can run the rpms up
over 2,000 rpm, but it still dies after those 10 seconds. After 8-10
attempts, the engine will then continue to run. It runs well and starts
easily as long as the engine is warm.

The instant start suggests the cold start injector is okay.

Being able to hold the rpm at 2,000+, until it dies, seems to eliminate the
auxiliary air value as a suspect?

That it runs okay after 8-10 attemps to start (warms up the engine somewhat)
suggests the problem is somehow related to engine temp.

There is a referance to the control pressure regulator in the manual,
referring to it as the warm-up value. The terminals check out at about 20 ohms. 

Help! Where do I look next?

Michael
