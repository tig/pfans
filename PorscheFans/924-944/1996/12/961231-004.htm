     I have removed them using the method I described and it doesn't take 
     too long.  The point is, not to have to use a tool (vise grips) that 
     was never intended for that job.  The vise grips do not fit well, can 
     cause further damage to the rubber boots and associated hardware, and 
     not to mention damage to flesh and bone when they slip.  Many a fine 
     mechanic has uttered words not sociably correct under that kind of 
     duress.
     
     If you have taken all the time to clean and pre-lube everything else, 
     go the remaining step and get it right.  Besides, those bolts should 
     not be too tight anyway, but play it safe.

     Good stuff for all.

     Wow. After reading all the trouble, trials, and tribulations people go
     through to remove CV Joint bolts, I wonder why Porsche uses those 
     silly
     12 point bolts. I'm almost sure it's so some old German Engineer named
     Helmet can get his revenge for being assigned to work on the ass end 
     of
     the car, when he wanted to work on the head end.
     
     I'm almost to the point where I think it's better to just order 24 new
     bolts (at about $1.00 a piece) and then just rip the original ones out 
     with a Vise Grips. I mean, time is money. I have a clutch to replace, 
     and 
     I don't really want to spend 2 hours cleaning and removing some silly 
     bolts when I could be doing something manly, like wresting with the 
     exhaust system or trying to remove the torque tube. 
     
     I'm curious, does anyone who had the shop change the clutch have their
     receipt? If so, could you look and see if you were charged for 24 new
     CV joint bolts, and 9 new flywheel bolts? I can't see a shop wasting
     time trying to remove those bolts when they can charge a customer for
     new ones, and do it in 1/10 the time. Personally, I would rather pay
     for new hardware than have my shop charge me 2 hours labor (at $70
     an hour) to remove the bolts.
