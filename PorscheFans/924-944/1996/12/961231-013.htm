One could try just an oil change, I suppose, but you really ought to be able
to get pressure pumping even highly diluted oil.

Was it firing?  Were you pressurizing the cooing system abnormally (BIG
bubbles and overflow?)?

Well it shouldn't, but perhaps in a very marginal situation.....pure
speculation at this point.

Reason might not prevail here, for headgaskets blow in part because of
overheating and resultant flexing of the head, so perhaps yours needs to
warm up to flex enough.  And there is no such thing as white SMOKE from any
engine I ever saw.  Black is fuel SMOKE.  Blue is oil SMOKE.  White is
coolant VAPOR.  You should be able to smell the vapor.

This should indeed be your biggest concern.  A blown gasket won't do much
over the short term.  

What is the general condition of the car?  Mileage, cleanliness, leaks,
known history, etc.  Did both problems/indications start at the same time?
In a complex presentation like this (to me, more than one symptom is always
complex), one needs to beware of red herrings.  At the moment I can't
resolve a coolant vapor problem with anything related to oil pressure, short
of chaos.   Keep in touch.
