It is normal for any internal combustion engine to generate water vapor 
as part of the 'blowby' gasses inside the crankase.  This moisture will 
condense on upper level cool surfaces (since heat rises) until the 
temperature of these surfaces and the oil itself is above the boiling 
point of water.  At this point, any condensed water (which when mixed 
with oil, will have the dreaded gooey brown look) will boil away.

If you drive short trips, or live in an extremely cold climate, you will 
see the brown stuff on the inside of your oil filler cap, or even on the 
dipstick.  You must either (1) drive long enough to boil out any moisture 
(at least 5 miles or so) or change your oil _very_ frequently.

As long as oil hasn't mixed with the coolant (goo in coolant reservoir) it
is safe to assume the oil cooler seals or head gasket are ok.  Otherwise,
you can take a sample of goo and have it tested to see if the moisture
mixed with the oil is plain water from condensation, or coolant from a
broken seal.  A garage can also test for exhaust gasses in the coolant 
reservoir, an indication of a blown head gasket.
