>Yes, you do. You need to prep the car to the hilt to win, but nobody goes
out to WIN their first or second season. Those are to LEARN.

>With a little creativity you can put in your window net and still have a
great looking car. The kill switch is easy, follow the picture in the rule
book. Use a remote pull that comes up out of the hood by the window. When
the race is over, tuck it away.

>Your car won't get trashed. Just remember a few things while your raceing:
>
>1. Stay on your line. Never pull over to "let" a faster car by. He is
expecting you to be in control and not do anything stupid. 
>
>2. Be aware of the other cars, but don't focus on them. A common mistake is
looking in your mirror, seeing a faster car, and then overdriving the corner
(spin or crash or flatspot or just feel stupid) in order to not slow them
up. Go at your own pace.
>
>3. Be very liberal with point-by's. Go as far as to back off on the gas a
little to facilitate their pass. Once they are by, get on thier ass(for as
long as you can) and LEARN.
>
>4. Have fun!

>You WILL have someone to race with. It may be a car that is a lot less
powerfull but with a really good driver, or it may be your twin, seperated
at birth. Either way, You'll grin like and idiot for about a month after the
race.
