Any or all of the above.  A head gasket would be confirmed if you were
getting big bubbles in the coolant reservoir.  White steam is typical of
coolant in the cylinders.  HOWEVER, my first concern would be the oil
pressure.  Don't run that thang when the red light is on.  DON't RUN that
thang when the red light is on.........

Do a compression test.  Drain both coolant and oil and examine them.  If
they look the same you are in trouble, etc.  The alarmist in me would
consider doing the rod bearings, but lets wait for the test results....

Do let us know what you find.
