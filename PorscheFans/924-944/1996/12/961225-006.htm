Greetings P-philes!

I trust everyone had a great holiday and you got what you wanted.  Well back
to the next problem at hand.  I have recently noticed that my drivers side
seat belt is wet, damp not soaking, after it rains.  I haven't encountered
this with the passenger side belt and really have no idea where the water is
from as there is no rust on the rocker panels and/or wheel wells.  I'm
thoroughly confused.

Also I have found that my sunroof latch will fully retract with the car
running. I thought in order for the arms to retract all the way in order to
remove the panel the car's ignition had to be in the 1 position?  Is this a
problem I can fix? 

Thanks to all for the responses on how to fix the clock light.  I will be
attempting to remedy the problem tomorrow.

TIA,
Riff
