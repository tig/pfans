In response to Farzaan's post.
Yes it is normal, at least in my cars here in Edmonton.  Every winter I have
the same frothy mixture on the underside of the oil filler cap and or the
top of the filler neck to varying degrees.  My daily commute to work (to and
from a heated garage) in current minus 35 Celcius temps is about
11kilometres (6.5 miles) and unless I drive a longer distance to burn off
the moisture in the oil it remains until the weather warms up or the oil is
changed.  .  There is never any  oil in the coolant expansion tank or signs
of moisture on the dipstick  otherwise I too would be concerned.  I know of
a few other winter drivers here who seem to have the same problem.  However,
Farzaan, please let us know what the shop finds is causing this.
A belated Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to All
