     a common custom for porsche drivers to flash their lights as a 
     greeting to other porsches (although my flashing often went 
     unrecognized by non-914s :( !!!)
     >since acquiring a 911 about a year ago, i've usually tried a greeting

     >does anyone do this (or some other greeting - like wave) anymore? 
     thanks...

     I remember reading an article a long time ago about Porsche owners and 
     their secret salutes as they pass each other.  If they participated, 
     it went something like this:
     
     1) Owner of a bottom of the line, cheap, each fender a different 
     color, running three different makes of tires, primer spotted paint, 
     rusted, blue smoking, Porsche. ==> Owner waves enthusiastically with 
     both hands, steers with left knee, flashes one remaining working 
     headlight, and cheers loudly! Continues to wave long after vehicle 
     passes over crest of hill.
     
     2) Well kept older car, conservatively postured, driver flashes lights 
     once.  Could be a ghost of a smile seem if side window is down.
     
     3) Newer Porsche, clean and well kept, impeccable street manners.  
     Owner will not flash lights, but can be seen lifting all five fingers 
     from behind the steering wheel.  No facial expression changes.
     
     4) Owner of a Turbo four wheel drive 911, brand new in perfect 
     condition. No window sticker of course!  Owner waits for the last 
     second, then lifts single (not middle) finger above crest of steering 
     wheel and returns to previous grip.  If this response is given by 
     mistake, owner lifts hand off steering wheel and brushes hair - way 
     cool!
     
     Notice the odds of participating are inversely proportional to the 
     cost of the vehicle.  Makes you wonder which drivers are really having 
     more fun for the money?
