For turbocharged cars, tuners usually like to run the car at 12:1 at
WOT.  13:1 is probably where the power peak rests at WOT, but it's 
likely getting too close to detonation for comfort.  Under part throttle
or normal driving or even under moderate boost, 14.7:1 is what the
oxy sensor should be dialing the mixture to.  When I used to drag race
my previous car, I'd set the fuel computer to 13:1 with 94 octane pump
gas and you could feel the timing backing off to prevent detonation.  If
we ran it at 12:1, the timing wouldn't back down as much, but the power
wasn't as good getting off the line and the car felt soft (that's the
best way to describe it).  Whatever the case, the best times came from
running 13:1, but on the street, I always ran 12:1.

As for the cat, it may not be a good idea.  The reasons are that if the
mixture is off, generally too rich, it will soot up the cat rather
quickly.  Now, with the Porsche, we are lucky because our external
wastegate dumps after the cat which helps considerably.  I don't
know what the stockers run, but you can get an aftermarket 3" cat for
a reasonable price.  These units have very little restriction.

I have the K&N A:F mixture gauge.  Where did you tap yours into?  Did
you go straight into the oxy wire, or is there a diagnostic connector
somewhere in the interior?

Brake proportioning valve...

Hmmm... many people on the list have emailed me saying that they've
had that click in their brake pedal since they've had their cars.  I can
definitely feel a reduction in braking power, and since it's under
warranty, I'll let them change it and see what happens.  I hope that fixes
it because the brakes really are quite bad right now.  I bled the brakes
and it didn't make any difference and the pads don't look glazed either.
I'll keep you filled in.
