 Are you really going to do this job on your back in the garage?  You will
 need more than tools, some divine intervention would be better.  This is a
 tough job.  We've done 100's and I don't think anyone in my shop can get it
 done in much less than 8 hours with a hoist, transmission jack, every metric
 tool that you can imagine, and tons of experience.

I can attest that this is one horrible job. I did it once, on my back, in the
middle of winter, in an unheated garage. It was an 86 Turbo and about half
way thru I seriously, really seriously considered packing everything into
boxes and having the car flat bedded to a repair shop. After three weekends
and countless trips to buy or borrow tools I got the job done successfully. I
did feel a feeling of accomplishment but that was blunted by the pain from
strains, bruises and cuts. 
When the clutch failed in my 89 Turbo I took it to a repair shop. I wasted no
time contemplating doing it myself again. Best of luck Barry!!
Regards and Happy Thankgiving to everyone!
Jerry
