Hi Dave,

Thanks so much for the reply.  If you are not careful when engaging gears,
yes they will grind!  This especially includes reverse!  From a standing
cold start, I always engage the clutch, select third gear, then the gear I
want (first, or second) with the clutch still engaged.  If I do not, the
consequences are gear grinding.  First is also just hard to engage as well.
Reverse will grind very easily.

Again, when first gear is engaged with the clutch in, the car will not free
roll backward down a hill.  The car will not move forward on a level
pavement with the clutch engaged.

Once the car is warm (5 to 10 miles of driving), everything is sweet
(nearly perfect).  The warmer it gets, the better it gets.  In hot weather
it seems to work nearly perfect.  My 944S shifting is effortless at 55 K
miles.

Other patient data:

Car has 117 K miles
Clutch slave cylinder replaced @ 110 K miles
Clutch master cylinder replaced @ 117 K miles (started leaking)
Clutch replaced @ 100 K miles
Pilot bearing seems to be original, slightly sluggish with some rough feeling
Fork tube needle bearings very gummy and stiff
Initial clutch inspection shows clutch in good working order
Flywheel not yet inspected.
Torque tube drive shaft bearings seem a little noisy with slight rough feeling
Gearbox has Swepco gear oil replaced @ 110 K miles (no noticeable improvements)

Let me know if there are any more details you need.  Thanks again...


Marv (1987 944 & 1987 944S)
