The AOR is a transmission designation code. It was provided with the
1988 944 Turbo S and the 1989 944 Turbo in the USA. Different gearing
and final drive ratio for Turbos (as opposed to normally aspirated and
16valve cars), special hardening of the 1st and second gears, and the 
oil cooler (which was only available on Turbo transaxles).

The oil cooler is a loop of ribbed pipe, leading from the differential
cover, back towards a couple of coils and ending at the rear of the trans.
According to the tech spec booklet, the 944S2 trans which had oil coolers
were only sold in Switzerland.

If you had an AOR transaxle, it would mean that a PO had made a change. It
was not available on the S2 cars.

You can tell what kind of transaxle you had installed at the factory by looking
at the paper sticker near the spare tire well. My guess is that you have
the AOT or the AOS transaxle.

Good Luck!
