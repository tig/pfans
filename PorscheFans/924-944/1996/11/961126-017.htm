Hay I found a neat trick on start ups! This cold weather sucks and 
mine hates it! So in the morning when I start it (or if it sounds 
like it might fly apart) I give it just enough gat to bring the rpms 
up to 1500 and a funny thing happens.  If you hold the acc. pedal 
there the rpms will come up to 2000 and the engine will sound fine, 
and sense I've started doing this the idle has smoothed out as well!
I think even help lessen the wear on the oil pump.???  Still no good 
way of stopping the car as I know of.

Know you Volks said to keep you posted on my belt squeakage so
here goes...   Right up until Nov. 24 all the belts had been quite, 
it took about two days after I got it back from the shop, but they 
finally stopped squeaking.  Now last night for the first time it got 
below 10 deg. F here.  And on the way home my babe was
a squeaking!  Only on downshifts and starts.  After the car 
warmed up it stopped!


Now I know it's not drive belts (because they're toothed right) and I 
wasn't turning when it would start squeaking, so this rules out power 
steering belt, and I don't have a 'poor charging light' so that XNAYS 
the alt. belt and the A/C works fine. (Too good in the winter) SO 
WHAT THE HE** IS IT!!!

please offer your much needed advice at this time, thanks in advance.
