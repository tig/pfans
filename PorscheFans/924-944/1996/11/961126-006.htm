     Hi Guys,
     Well even though I changed the MAS on the 944, the hesitation is 
     still there.  What I notice now (more than before) is that when the 
     engine is under power, if I let go of the gas for an instant, and then 
     get back on it, the car will actually hold back for about half a 
     second before taking off again.  It is this sluggish response which 
     makes the car less than perfect...  Something is still buggin' me 
     about the vacuum on the inlet side, but I can't find any leaks!
     Also I slapped a set of late C2 rims (16") on the car, which has 
     made it more susceptible to 'tracking' when going down the Interstate. 
     Is this a problem that has been found before?  Can it be easily 
     fixed?
     My gearing has obviously changed, my MPG has changed, and so has my 
     cruisin' speed <g> so my trip to work is now shorter and more fun! 
     Cheers,  Jan
