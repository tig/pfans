How well this idea would work depends on several things:   If you can take care
of them, you've got a chance.  Whether it is a tuned reflex enclosure or a
simple sealed "box", you need to know the internal volume so you can select a
driver with the right parameters.  Maybe you could measure the volume by filling
with a measured amount of water. If it's to be a reflex, the design is more
involved.  However, sealed box designs are not so picky as reflex designs with
regard to matching the driver and the volume:  You might just try it and see
what you get.  Also, the "box" needs to be as rigid and non-resonant as
possible.  If the walls of the cavity flex - or if you have air leaks, for that
matter - you lose efficiency, which will be evident as a bass response curve
that falls off sooner than designed, the lower the frequency.  I'm not so sure
you could practically do much about flex without welding in braces.  

Use 3/4" plywood for the baffle (i.e. the part the speaker is attached to).  Be
sure to line the internal volume with an inch or so of fiberglass insulation,
and eliminate any potential "buzzers".
