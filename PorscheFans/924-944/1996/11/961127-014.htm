SORRY,
     i screwed up. i promise not to send anythign that doesnt have to do with my 
p-car EVER again!!!!!  it has nothing to do with legend or age just something 
that me stop my busy life for a second and think of others, maybe we should all 
do that more often just not here.  my judgement was bad and it wont happen 
again.  if you guys and ladies want to get back at me send as many pics as you 
want to my email address if that will make you happy.  please no more responses 
on that subject and once again im SORRY.]
