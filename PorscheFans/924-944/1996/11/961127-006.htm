This story doesn't contain any useful information, just a detailed
explanation of my bad luck.

Just wanted to thank all the people that responded to my nagging question.
It was becoming a real problem, my car kept on dying and once the battery
died from trying to start it...
I had to abandon it several times.

After reviewing the 15+ very helpful replies, I decided that the first
course of action would be to replace the DME relay. The part costs $CAN59
at the dealer, but I figured I would save on taking it to a mechanic for
diagnosis; I'm pretty broke at this point.
I couldn't trust my car, so I borrowed my mom's while she was at work and
picked up the relay and a Haynes manual.

I replaced it that night after finding the bugger. Had to remove the fuse
board to get a good grip on it. The battery was dead so I got some of my
brother's friends to give me a hand push-starting it.... vroom. Everything
seemed ok, but I wanted to take it for a test drive and charge up the
battery. I decided to go to my friend's house to pick up my knapsack at
1:30am saturday night (I'm nocturnal).

Everything was going great on the way there. It was drizzling a bit, as it
usually does here in Vancouver. I stopped and started the car a few times,
and everything worked perfect. Not conclusive evidence, but my optimism was
growing.... big mistake.

I was travelling on a one-way road towards downtown, in the left lane.
There was a Chevrolet Cavalier a bit ahead of me, driving in the right
lane. All of a sudden, he turns on his left turn signal, and starts to slow
down as he moves into my lane, where I happen to be! I try to avoid
collision by moving into the parking lane (there was a break in cars), but
then he does a 90 deg turn into a street, cutting me off. I try to turn
with him, but it's wet, I'm going too fast for a turn and BAAAMMM!

I jump out of the car and lose it. I was just rear-ended by a Cavalier 2
weeks ago, I just fixed the car finally, and now my entire right-front of
the car was crushed, including bent control arm of the front wheel. I'm
shouting at the guy, mostly because I want him to admit that he just made a
left turn from the right lane. He looks confused and doesn't say much. The
cops show up and issue him a ticket. I watch my newly repaired, crippled
944 get towed away as I stand alone in the middle of a bad part of
town....... better find a cab fast.

Now I'm driving a rental Dodge Neon. It's good in the rain, but it sure
isn't a Porsche.
The guy admitted full fault, so everything will be fixed with no cost to
me, but I've had enough bad luck with this car lately. I don't want to put
it through any more punishment, so as soon as its repaired, off to storage
it goes for the rest of the winter and out comes my 81 'vette.


chevette, that is.

Once again, thanks to everyone for your helpful advice. I'll be sure to
pester you with any further problems, car-related or otherwise. Maybe when
I get the car back, I'll be able to find out if it is truly fixed.
