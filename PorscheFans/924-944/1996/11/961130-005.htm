Hello all ,  

**  Warning - Long winded sob story about to begin - ***
** skip to end for tech question*** 


Well, my one year of P-Car ownership has been interesting to say the least. 
 It started almost exactly one year ago.   Four days before thanksgiving I 
pick up my new (to me) 1986 944......Boy am I in hog heaven.   The night 
before thanksgiving I'm driving around the Washington D.C. Beltway getting 
ready to exit onto  I-95 south, when from my left darts a huge 8 point 
Buck!  (imagine this now, I'm in the far right lane of an area of the 
beltway that has at least 8 lanes of cars moving in either direction at 
65mph+....and this animal makes it across SEVEN of those lanes before 
choosing to ride on my hood <and roof and back window>)  *sigh* (US)$6kplus 
worth of damages and month and a half at the shop and its deep into winter 
by the time I get it back.  Into storage it goes.  Three and a half months 
later the snow is gone enough for me to feel comfortable enough to drive 
around again.

Well, We all thawed out and the ol' girl ran fine for quite some time but 
then.......<Jaws theme as background music>  I let my girlfriend take it 
one day (it must be love)....I get a phone call and she says that when she 
parked it she saw some "smoke" come from underneath the hood.  I asked if 
there was alot and what color, to which she replies "what would you 
consider alot?" <*doh!*>

I zoom down to the parking deck and find that the radiator hose seems to 
have let loose <*whew*>.   I get the car towed (no time to try and repair 
on the spot) and my mechanic says that he sees there's coolant and oil 
mixed and to be prepared for the worst (Happy Turkey-Day!).....he's checked 
the oil cooling unit and the gasket and says there's nothing wrong with 
them <*sigh*>.......soooo, one year later, the "Thanksgiving Day P-Car 
Curse on Me" has struck once again.

***************
QUESTION!

The dreaded mixing problem has struck.  Now, where did this mixing come 
from?
My Mech  had the cooling unit checked for cracks (some UV light test thing 
I think) and the gasket looked fine. So is there anything else we can check 
or do before giving this engine last rites?  If it's not something 
relatively inexpensive (that's relative to the cost of a new or rebuilt 
engine) then I'm gonna have to give up this car or store it for many many 
months before I can get around to doing anything with it.


Thanks!

Jeff
