I personally would be wary of applying voltage to a pump which had a
highly-combustible liquid flowing through it!  My fear would be that a
spark from your power source might trigger a small fire and then your pump
would REALLY be toast (no pun intended...)!  So be careful!

I don't believe that it's possible since the pump is all crimped together
(or at least that's how I remember mine).  The rubber boot does come off--
KEEP IT since you won't get another with the rebuilt pump.  I remember
having to make two thin slits to allow the rubber to move enough to extract
the pump, so it is possible without destroying the rubber.  You might
actually try a few different variety auto-parts stores like Kragen, Chief,
or Foreign Auto Parts since they will occasionally surprise me with better
prices and warranties on things like starters.  If not, Performance
Products is where I got mine and I think I paid like $110.  There are lots
of other sources too.  Write me direct if you need other sources.
