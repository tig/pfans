I was following the discussion on water collecting in the rear storage
compartments (tools, compressor etc.).  That also happens on my 86' 944 when
I wash it and when it rains heavily.  I assumed that it was the rear hatch
seal needing replacement even though I have not been able to find where the
water enters.

Yesterday when filling the gas tank, I inadvertently overfilled, and some
gas entered the small drain hole at the base of the gas filler cap.  While
driving I smelled alot of gas and when I checked the right rear storage
compartment, sure enough, there was a little gas there.

Question:  Is it possible for the water to be entering the trunk through the
small hole by the gas filller cap?  Is there supposed to be a plug on that hole?

Please Advise
