Todd -- I'm curious about your oversteer problem because I rarely
experience it in my S2, and I've spent the last few months dialing out
understeer. Exactly when do you get this oversteer, and how is your S2
suspension set up? The only times I've experienced oversteer on the street
is when the road surface has low traction (water, gravel, tar patch), when
I'm braking VERY hard and turning at the same time, or when I'm carrying
too much speed into a sweeper.  Sounds like your tires are worn, or a brand
that has comparatively little traction.

George B. -- on your comment about worn shocks causing oversteer, did you
mean all shocks worn, or differential wear in the front or back? Seems like
worn shocks would generally increase body roll, and favor understeer - or
am I missing something here?
