Hello,

Just wanted to drop a note about something that was happening to my car
and the solution to it.  I was experiencing a distinct click in my brake
pedal at about 75% travel.  I also felt that the brakes were not up to
what they felt like when I got the car, in essence, they would fade
easily.  You may have read me ranting about how I didn't think the 
Metal Masters were too hot anymore.  Well, the clicking and brake reduction
have been linked to a faulty brake proportioning valve.  The click is
coming from the passenger side footwell or rear of the front wheel well.
Is this where the brake proportioning valve is located on an ABS car?

While the car was at the shop, I also got them to fix a stop in the power
window assembly that must have broken off, as well as a dead seat heater
switch.  All of the above are understandable problems with a car that is
7 years old;  they are also relatively inexpensive to repair.

The funny thing is, none of these very small problems detracted at all 
from the wickedness of driving this awesome engineered drivers machine.

Farzaan.
