Hi Barry,

I think of them as sockets that work where a spanner might be
needed. Also a crowfoot on a 10in ratchet extension works like a
deep-deep-offset wrench, a necessity to adjust the end of my
clutch cable deep in the engine bay -- so its quite versatile.

My copy of Michael Kehr's 944/951 Clutch HowTo (excellent, was
posted on pfiles, you have a copy?) recommends a 13mm and 15mm
flarenut crowsfoot -- one use is to unbolt the turbo.

I'd say a flarenut crowsfoot set makes a better buy than both a
flarenut wrench set and a plain crowfoot set, and a plain
spanner set.

>Also, I don't have any flexhead ratchets or wobble extensions. 
>Do I need to get some before I start work? 

Oh yes you do. No, make that an "OH YESSSS YOU DO!" :)

There were at least half a dozen or more occasions that I was
forced to build a "snake" -- One notorious bolt at the top of
the clutch bell housing required the use of -
  - a 1/2 in drive (54 ft-lb torque spec into the iron block),
  - a 1/2-3/8 adapter, 
  - a 10in extension with wobble (wobble very important!), 
  - a universal joint, and 
  - finally a socket.  :)

Oh, and I forgot, I also had to rapidly evolve an articulated
joint in my forearm bones :-) I took a photo of this one (the
snake, not my forearm), lets see if how it develops.

I found the 10in wobble very rugged, and multipurpose -- the
single most praised tool I bought. I got mine from Pep Boys,
Sears did not seem to carry a wobble. All my other tools are
Sears Craftsman.

BTW, there appear to be two different "Craftsman" branded tools
around there -- one from the regular Sears store is good.  The
other "Craftsman", sold by Parts-America, (which is now owned by
Sears), is _not_ so good.  The tools look very different, even
the consistency of the stamped markings is visibily inferior.

Best ...

PS: My "Two steps fwd, one backwards" saga continues, I think I
have to take the bell housing out again to scoop out a gram or
two of grease from the dinky pilot bearing -- when we tried to
push the torque tube in, the pressure of the grease caused it to
spring right back !!
