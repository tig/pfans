Just for interest, I thought I'd describe the stereo installation I made in my
`84 944 several years ago.  I haven't been on this list all that long, so maybe
others have described similar arrangements before, but if not, perhaps this will
give someone with an `83, `84, or early `85 some ideas.

The unit in the dash is a removable Sony XR-7280 (nice ergonomics), with
AM/FM/Cassette and control functions for the Sony 10 CD changer mounted in the
left rear cubby. It has a 14W/ch power amp built-in, and a line output for a
"rear fader", the control for which balances the output between the line output
and the built-in amps.  My main speakers, fed by the line output, are a pair of
ADS 2002's, which I bought used in 1977 (yes, 1977), integral to a Nakamichi
tape player system.  These are black anodized aluminum boxes each containing a
4" cone woofer and a 1" dome tweeter, biamped by two 40W amps, and the requisite
electronic crossover (1800hz or thereabouts), all inside each box.  These are
mounted atop a subwoofer enclosure that I designed and built from scratch.  The
2002's tops are beneath your mirror sight line to the edge of the spoiler, and
their bottoms are just at the back seat back, sightwise.  The subwoofer box
(nicely finished in satin black) was sized and shaped to fit behind the back
seat back (the cargo cover can be drawn up and over the 2002's). I got
interested in bass reflex design back in the mid seventies, when the Australian
Prof. Thiele's work was rediscovered and subsequently widely applied.  I was
playing in bands at the time, and built some bass guitar speaker enclosures,
with excellent results.  Anyway, this 944 box, my second one for a car, was
designed for a -3db cutoff of 29hz, using an 8" cone driver.  It is driven by an
Alphasonik amp that makes 80W in bridged mono mode.  I used a Proton electronic
crossover to split the fader signal to the subwoofer at 150hz, thus permitting
the 4-inchers in the 2002's to perform much better.  All the latter electronics
are mounted in the right rear cubby.  For both cubbies, the components therein
are mounted on vertical pieces of plywood, cut to contour.  It turned out to be
unnecessary to fasten the plywood to the car in order to have them be snug and
rattle free, and they can simply be lifted out for access to the components.

Back to the front:  I used the XR-7280's amps to feed a 4x6 speaker I installed
in the center dash location that Porsche saw fit to leave empty when they
provided the "four door" speaker option.  The terminals of this single speaker
are connected to the + outputs (only) of the two XR-7280 amp channels, resulting
in the "center channel" effect, whereby only out of phase information gets
amplified.   

At one time, I wired in a digital reverb unit (with pre-reverb delay) and amp to
drive the forward (only) OEM speakers in the doors.  The delayed reverb from the
end of the cabin opposite the main speakers gave the desired spatial effect,
augmented (albeit unrealistically) by whatever "surprise" voice popped up from
the dash "channel".  However, I ended up taking out the reverb set-up (but not
the dash channel set-up), for problemmatic reasons:  The reverb needed to be
adjusted for best results based on the material you were listening to, so the
controls had to be within reach, and I just flat couldn't find a place to put
the unit, other than flopping it in the back seat; and I couldn't keep the
system from picking up ignition noise and such brought on by all the loose
cables, convoluted connections, and ground loops.  Great idea, poor execution...

At the time I put all this in, loud, deep bass capability was rare in car
stereos.  That's changed, of course.  While my system now would be hopelessly
outclassed, at least in DB's, by systems in any number of low-rider pickups
downtown, fortunately I've aged to the point where I no longer give a rat's a**.
Being tri-amped, and utilizing a very efficient subwoofer, it is still MUCH more
than adequate even with these relatively low power amps.

The 2002's perform better than you would think, given their age, partly due to
the fact that I had to upgrade the 4-inchers along the way when the cone
surround on one of them split and started buzzing.  But their Achilles heel is
their vulnerability to heat:  In the summer, they absorb a lot of BTU's, located
as they are, under the back glass.  Even using a car cover, they get hot enough
for the built-in overtemp sensor to kick them out.  This switch usually closes
again within a few miles of driving with the roof and windows open, except on
the hottest days.

Regarding practicality:  The subwoofer box takes up perhaps a third or more of
the volume behind the seat back; and it needs the seat back to be up to keep it
from sliding forward in a crash.  If I need the space, I can just unplug the
thing and remove it.  In this case, I set the L/R balance to one side, select
Mono, and can still at least have the radio coming from the dash.  

If and when I improve on this system, it will be to 1) get better quality 4x6's
for the doors and dash, because even carrying auxiliary information such as
reverb and phase voices, their low quality is noticeable; 2) relocate, or
replace and relocate, the amps/crossovers for the 2002's to a location out of
the sun, perhaps in the areas adjacent to the hatch release mechanisms (The
right rear cubby is full, and I'm resisting the idea of kicking out the spare
tire); 3) install a multipole switch so that when I take the big box assembly
out I can still have decent sound from the four OEM speaker locations.  As it
is, I can travel lightly with great sound, or travel well-equipped with poor
sound.
