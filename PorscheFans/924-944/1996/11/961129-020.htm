Thank you again for your help with my 944 clutch removal.  Having to get
all the way down to the two yard line, and then to have to surrender the
ball was not my idea of fun today.

As you already know, I am trying to replace the pilot bearing at the end of
the crankshaft.  It seems that last year when the clutch was replaced, my
mechanic failed to replace this $10.00 part.  I suspect that the bearing is
at fault due to the behavior of the car when both the car and the outside
temperature are cold.  Basically, when the car is on an incline, the clutch
is engaged, and the transmission in gear, the car will not free roll until
the gear shifter is put into neutral.  Both the slave and master hydraulic
cylinders have been replaced, and adjusted correctly.  The car is also very
hard to get into gear (reverse and first are the worst, with each higher
gear getting better) until warmed up.  My thoughts are that the pilot
bearing is bad causing some drag that keeps the drive shaft turning when
the clutch is engaged.  When the car is warm, the bearing will rotate
freely.

So this Thursday I began the replacement procedure.  I was very happy with
my progress of dismantling the drive train to access the clutch, until I
had to remove the clutch fork tube and the two engine speed sensors at the
top of the bell housing.  It seems that the small housing also needed to be
removed to free the bell housing.  In the end the fork tube gave way with
persistent effort on my part; however, the speed sensors would not yield!
Seems that I am five cents short of a happy meal!  I found it necessary to
utilize a chisel to destroy the small speed sensor housing when only one of
the two socket head screws would relinquish its throne.  Oh well, beats
removing the engine to drill the bugger.

Now that I have removed the bell housing, clutch, and at last, the pilot
bearing, I have made a discovery that disturbs me.  I had expected to find
the pilot bearing very stiff to turn.  Quite the contrary, this bearing
turns very freely.  There seems to be some minor roughness in the spin, but
I am surprised at the freedom of movement.  Could there be a problem with
the transaxle?  What other problems could cause the car to exhibit the
symptoms above.  Cold weather brings the worst out of this problem.  It has
also been a progressively worse issue for almost the last year and a half.

I am somewhat perplexed by this finding, but I also realize that my
assessment of the bearing may be flawed.  I want to be sure that I resolve
this problem while it is dismantled.  I do not want to needlessly repeat
this tear down again.  944 clutch replacement is an odious task, even when
you are prepared for it.  All in all, I have found most of the job
rewarding, even fun at times.  I guess I can not complain too much.  This
is my first time with this magnitude of repair.  A lot of things could have
gone wrong that didn't.  Then again, I have yet to reassemble this critter.

If anyone has any guesses, wisdom, or suggestions about this strange
behavior with the pilot bearing, I would be most grateful.

Thanks George for your suggestions (Obviously, I will need that replacement
part we spoke about).

Thanks to everyone else in advance.  I hope all of your holidays are joyful.
