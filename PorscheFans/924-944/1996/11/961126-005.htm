"Barry Lenoble asked about special tools for his 951 clutch job"

The crowsfoot goes where no man has gone before.  Due to the restricted space,
an extension ( here is where a wobble comes in handy) is usually the hot ticket.
Flexhead rachets are sometimes the only thing that will work.  Get the ones with
the fine tooth rachet gear.  In addition to the regular long handle one, Sears
has a shorty for about $22 that works great in tight spaces.  Yes, Dr. P did
make some tight spaces on this little gem.  Proto makes a socket spinner, that
doubles as a real short (about 3/4") extension, for after you have broken the
nut loose.

Here are some tool catalog sources:

MSC Ind Supply, 1(800)645-7270, Free, weighs about 10 lbs, full of tools and
other stuff.

Sears Ind Tools, 1(800)776-8666, Free, lists things you will not find stocked in
the retail store, great reference.

WW Grainger, 1(800)323-0620, Free, lists tools(Proto) and a ton of other stuff.

McMaster Carr, 1(310)692-5911, L.A. branch #, Free if you can get one, we buy
from them and they will not send us a new catalog.  Hand tools and a ton of
other.

J.C.Whitney, 1(312)431-6102, Free, questionable quality on some items however
they have some unusual cheap things, tools and auto parts

Harbor Freight Tools, 1(800)423-2567, Free, made in China throw away tools, good
for grinding on, welding on & heating and bending, if your brain storm doesn't
work it will have not cost much.

Some of these vendors will only sell to companies, be creative if you have to
when asking for a catalog.
