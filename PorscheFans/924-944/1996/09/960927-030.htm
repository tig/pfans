I dont know where to start, so I will tell the whole story. I just hope that
those of you with the knowledge I want take the time to read this through.
there is a problem in here, I need help with!!!

Those of you that have been following my story know that yesterday I put on a
K&N cone filter and today I was putting in my Autothority chip. Ok, I posted
the results of the Cone yesterday. Today, I add the chip. As I start driving
the only noticable difference low end is that it takes care of the negative
impact of the filter (for those that didnt read about the filter, it was
worse at low RPM but better high). anyway, in the high range I couldnt tell
immediatly if there was really more power, but it was certainly happy reving.
it was much happier reving. I was having a blast. the first time I rev'd
higher than it used to go I was scared stiff. Now it pulls straight to 7000
(they raised the rev limited 400 rpm). 400 rpm doesnt sound like a lot, but
it is in the car! I know you shouldnt go at high rpm all the time, but no one
has ever told me you can never go to the limiter. anyway, I am having a blast
driving. the happier reving makes the car a lot more fun to drive (IMHO) and
the extra rev range makes a big difference passing. anyway, I am 2 miles from
home. THings are going great. I pass a whole line of cars in a lane that just
opened up and then slow for a red light. suddenly my temp gauge (which was
fine a few minutes earlier) was really high! there is smoke coming from under
my hood on the right side!!! I shut off the car, hit the hazzards (get a lot
of laughs from the other cars I just zoomed by. including "ha ha you blew it
up fat boy". I am a bit overweight). The smoke is steam. there are pools of
coolant (I am assuming, it is a green liquid) on the engine block. that burns
off quick. I let the car sit for a minute, since I am only 2 miles from home
I start to drive again. now the gauge is even higher, I again stop (this time
not in a lane) and pop the hood. the cooling fan stops almost immediatly
(usually it goes for a while). I look at the coolant level, and from what I
can tell (it is supposed to be clear, but it doesnt seem to be that clear)
there is none! Anyway, I am assuming that since a service wsa just done on
the car that some hose was not put on tight or something like that. anyway, I
cant see anything off and I am afraid (to stupid or too smart) to open the
cap to add more (I was near a gas station). I hit the hazzards drive home
never reving over 2200rpm. it is now parked. In a few hours I will go and
check the coolant. If there is none as I suspect can I fill it and then drive
it to the service place? or should I not drive it at all? how much damage do
you think was done? I hope nothing serious since it was not run hard this
way. the temp gauge didnt hit the red enough to turn on the light until I was
limping it home, so I did catch it, I think. If a hose burst does this mean I
should forget (I was going to use another word, but this is a public forum)
the chip, or should I just get some good braided hoses? well, any
advice/comments are welcome. DAMN! once this is taken care of, assuming that
it is not a direct problem from the chip I will post a more detailed results
of the chip and cone filter for those of you considering them. I feel sort of
relived right now, when I first saw the smoke on the right side of the engine
bay I thought the chip had burned out the computer (just first gut reaction).
the computer is on the passenger side just above the floor boards, and under
the glove box area. so, this could have been it. anyway, thats all, for those
that did read all of this, thank you. - Doug (pissed off)
