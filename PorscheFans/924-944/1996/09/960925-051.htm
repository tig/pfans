i gotta say i can't believe some of the posts here re: Farzaan and his =
current tinker toy.

jeez guys, if we were practical, we sure as hell would not be a) driving =
pcars, and b) not be wasting our time on the net like this.  why give =
him a hard time?  and what is this crap about "waste of a good porsche"? =
 it's a car folks, not an icon.  these things are toys, and you're =
supposed to play with toys (or did you keep yours on a shelf as a kid?). =
 man, this is the kind of thing that gives a bad name to the whole p-car =
crowd.  porsche does not have the ultimate insight into what everyone =
wants of expects, so hot rod 'em to be what you want (unless you *like* =
being like everyone else).

i've been following with interest Farzaan's posts, 'cause i may get a =
turbo, and do stuff along the same lines.  i've built a really nuts 914 =
with a 2.6 4 cyl, every one said "ah, it'll blow up at the first event", =
and it's just working ducky.  it's also lot's of fun blowing off the odd =
(but not all) mustangs in the stoplight grand prix. =20

hell, maybe i'll just end up putting a 951 engine in the 914 instead of =
upgrading to a smallblock chev.  i'm sure i'll i'll be ridiculed for =
either of those approaches, but i'll have fun.

Farzaan, give 'em hell.  too bad you aren't in rennesport region.=20

anyway, just had to vent a bit... i'm ok now... time for my pills and my =
nap
