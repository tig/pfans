Hi Farzaan,

Easy there, Amigo.  Take a chill-pill, and pull up a seat here by Yer Kindly ol'
Unka Bart.  If you've been into the archives of 'Philes, and it seems to me that
you have, you should also know that you have *NOT* been flamed by anyone here.

Oh yeah, there's been a little irreverent skepticism expressed, and some of it 
may have been a bit impolite, but no real *flames*!  And I haven't even seen 
anything that conveyed any real malicious intent,  If I had, I'd be the first to
point out the difference between a Porsche and a Porcupine.  But since there 
*hasn't* been any real malicious intent expressed, I won't need to point out 
that a with porcupine, the prick is on the outside.

Yer Kindly ol' Unka Bart, a drag-racer in an earlier incarnation (before you 
were born, as a matter of fact) has enjoyed your posts, and he doesn't even own 
a water-pumper (got one of them overgrowed Volkswagens instead).  Methnks that 
yer a mite too touchy, lad, lighten up a bit, we're all friends here!

Well, that's part of the problem.  The other is thin-skinnedness on the part of 
some.  That is usually curable, either by exposure to enough good-natured gives,
or through strong drugs, sex and Rock 'n Roll.  Not, by the way, that I would 
ever recommend that later course of action, even though it's always worked for 
me...(and then, there's Herb, but this is a family-oriented list, so we won't go
into that.)

Farzaan, old rutabega, this has the faint echo of "Maw, make johnnie stop 
hittin' me..."

Here's a final observation.  Bear in mind, that this is not an unfriendly 
message when I observe that there are one or two clues in your message that hint
that the problem is an overly-tender ego that bruises easliy.  Yer Kindly ol' 
Unka Bart's advice, (satisfaction guaranteed or double yer money back) is to
just mutter "@asshole" under yer breath and hit the ol' "D" key when a message 
comes that offends you.  

"Illegitimi non Carborundum" should be your watchword.

Yer Kindly ol' Unka Bart loves ya in any event.
