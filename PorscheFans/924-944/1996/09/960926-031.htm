>My lament is that I ran a Nissan 300 zx Twin Turbo recently and couldn't
keep up. I saw some kind of an aftermarket performance sticker on his
tail so I'm assuming it was chipped (mine isn't - yet). Does anyone know
what kind of performance a 300 zx twin turbo has when chipped?

I have tested 300 ZX Twin Turbos built by Rod Millen and HKS. The HKS one did
a two-way average of 183 mph (measured using state of the art test gear, not
speedo) on a 4-mile desert road. 1/4 mile in 12.80 @ 118 mph, 0-60 in 4.69.

For those of you who think all this tuning might be hazardous to the the life
of your engine, you're right, it can be if done wrong. The first attempt at
top speed, with the tuner driving, resulted in something in the 160s and a
hole through one piston. To try for top speed, they had leaned it out just a
bit too much and 4 miles at wide open throttle was all it took. (The ability
to fool with all sorts of engine parameters now gives you the ability to tune
yourself right out, and blow up your engine at the same time.) HUGE cloud of
white smoke could be seen approaching from about 2 miles away. He drove it
all the way back to LA that way, about 150 miles. Glad it wasn't me at the
wheel. Second attempt was about 3 months later, and that got the 183 average.
