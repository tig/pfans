Hi Jerry, yes  Farzaan is for real. He's a hard working member of our 
local auto-x club. Quite the analytical guy. I think he's approaching the 
mods on his p-car much like he did on his previous car (Talon), which did 
not blow up. I'll have to wait and see if old turbo technology (951) is 
as reliable as the newer cars.

Ohh, didn't you know there are banks more than willing to put you into 
debt if you have a steady job and live at home.

Really guys, Farzaan means well and he's just a bit overjoyed now that he 
has a real sportscar! Let's keep the criticism constructive.
