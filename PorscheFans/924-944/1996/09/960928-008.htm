Since I bought my car (85.5 944) I've had problems with wheel shake at 
65 - 70 mph. I have done a few things to try and cure it, but it never 
seems to get better:

- balance wheels (of course)
- new tires
- straightened two wheels at great cost
- new tie rods and ends
- inspect bushings
- new shocks

I read in 944.faq that this problem is not unusual. The recommendation 
is to balance the wheels on the car. My mechanic says 'Well, it helps.' 
I am also reluctant to do this because of the tire wear/rotation problem 
(the rear tires wear very quickly on the inside).

Then I read in this weeks PorscheFans mail about the placement of the 
wheel lock stud on the wheels. Very interesting, but I cannot find any 
red marks on the studs. I cleaned them up pretty good and looked really 
hard, but there's nothing there. Maybe Po. started this after my car was 
built? Some questions:

- Where is this marked stud relative to the slot where the dust cap is 
removed? Is it consistent? (the slot is between two studs)
- Is it possible to find the correct location of this stud by doing some 
kind of balance test on the rotors?
- Do new (oem and/or aftermarket) rotors have this marking?
- Any other ideas?

This seems to be a problem for many 944 owners. It would be great to 
find the proper solution.

Thx,
