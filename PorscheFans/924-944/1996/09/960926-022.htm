They work lots better. Like last longer and when used with ATE fluid don't
fade as quickly.

The dust is a hell of a lot worse. Like major scrubbing to get it off the
wheel. Coats the side of the car in really heavy driving. Black nasty stuff.

The noise is lots worse. Squeal at every light unless they are really warm.
Great for cutting through the low bass of that pickup in the next lane. I
don't care because I know they work.

I'd probably swap them out for the normal pads after the track if I didn't
enjoy being able to wake all the sleeping Lexus/BMW/Mercedes drivers up at
stop lights with the fingernail-on-chalkbaord sound.

Enjoy,

Doug Donsbach
