These are my personal opinions on the recent posts regarding Farzaan's
writings.  So please direct any flames to my attention via private email to
spare the list more controversy or bandwidth.
A 20 year old listmember with enthusiasm and a passion for Porsches who
dares to articulate ideas however controversial or contrary to ones own is a
refreshing and rare commodity at any time.  
If self discovery is much more potent than learning, then this is the forum
where dialogue of this kind should be welcomed encouraged and nurtured.
Assumptions and absolute certainty about what "IS" invariably kills all new
ideas, exploration and thought.  Besides nothing would ever get done if you
followed the rules. 
The level at which one takes offense usually defines maturity and if this
were the yardstick than Farzaan's reply to a rude post, cravenly written in
the third person was most impressive.  
If you make a habit of talking about your enemies as if they are present,
than just maybe,.... you will not have any.  If on the other hand, you do
not, ........you may not keep your friends either.
