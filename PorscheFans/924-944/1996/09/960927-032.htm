Just a quick bit of more info that I forgot to mention. I did look for any
hoses that were off or burst, I didnt see any. and the engine fan went off
just after I stopped the car (it usually stays on a long time). After the car
sat a few minutes I didnt feel a lot of heat coming from the engine bay (less
than after a normal drive), but the gauge was still reading high enough to
put on the light. i wonder if this means anything. Maybe the engine wasnt
that hot, but the sensor was. Just wanted to add this bit. I will check the
car later tonight or in the morning. I dont want to remove the cap until I
know it is cool. BTW the gauge was never pegged on all the way high. When I
first saw the steam it was not high enough for the dummy light, it was just
touching the red. After I re-started the light was on, but still not pegged,
so I am hopeing no damage was done, please tell me that...someone... - Doug
