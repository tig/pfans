| I read in 944.faq that this problem is not unusual. The recommendation 
| is to balance the wheels on the car. My mechanic says 'Well, it helps.' 
| I am also reluctant to do this because of the tire wear/rotation problem 
| (the rear tires wear very quickly on the inside).

Huh? It  _will_ probably help. I don't understand your justification of
your reluctance (if you'd said you didn't want to spend the money,
that'd be one thing, but what does _rear_ tire wear have to do with
_front_ wheel balance?)

BTW: My 944 seems to shake when the front tires are under inflated --
that wasn't in your list of things you'd checked (I know, kinda like
asking "did you plug it in?").

.....
| - Where is this marked stud relative to the slot where the dust cap is 
| removed? Is it consistent? (the slot is between two studs)

You mark the stud after having the wheels balanced on the car (that is,
let the shop balance the wheels, then when you get home, take them off,
remember which stud had the lock in it, and paint the tip of that stud
with some touch-up paint.)  BTW: Be sure that you have the wheel lock on
the stud closest to the inflation valve -- that way, you'll be able to
easily mount the wheel with the rotating mass in the same place it was
when the wheels were balanced (I'd guess that the valve placement is
more important than wheel locks since it's at a larger radius from the
center of the wheel and about the same mass).

Go talk to Harris and the crew at Gran Tourism East (at Shallowford Road
and Chamblee Tucker).  Best alignment / wheel folk in Atlanta,
