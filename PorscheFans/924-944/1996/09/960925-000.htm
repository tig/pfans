The good news is that your transmission's probably fine (just don't keep
forcing shifts, or your transmission will punish you.)  The bad news:

1.  Your pedal is not releasing the clutch all the way, thus the
transmission shafts are still turning.. and the syncros are preventing
your shifts, since they can't stop the shafts.  Check for adjustment, and
bleed the system if necessary. 

2.  The rubber cushion center of the clutch has broken down, thus causing
the clutch to bang back and forth against its stops, preventing proper
engagement. This would account for the excess play you noticed, and seems
to be most likely the problem from the description you give. 

Best wishes on getting things corrected!

Gregor - '89 944 2.7.  Eugene, OR.
