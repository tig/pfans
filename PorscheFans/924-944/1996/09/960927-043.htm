On my 85.5 it's a hex screw- if you're willing to part with the $5-$10 to
buy the correct metric allen wrench, you'll save yourself a lot of finger
beating and hassle.  It's also easier to get tight than by hand.  I forget
the correct size, but I remember it being pretty big- like 19mm or
something.  I too ended up cutting and then re-soldering the wires.  It
might be worth the effort to buy some quick-disconnects since some of them
don't require soldering and allows for any future disconnects.
