I've been dealing with Carlsen for the past two weeks to the tune of
$800+ in parts and tools.  I've found them to be helpful and fairly
priced.  They were happy to look up part numbers, and even when I had
the numbers, they double checked them for me.  The one "gotcha" in
dealing with them is that they don't necessary come right out and
offer their best prices.

For example, I purchased the 9201 (belt gauge) from them.  At first,
they quoted me $600 or some other ridiculous price.  I told them I'd
heard it's available "street price" was around $380 and they
immediately told me their best price was $360--a price I ended up
taking.  From then on, they automatically gave me their "best price"
on everything and I've found them to be quite competitive with the
discount houses.  (ie, $100 for a Porsche rebuilt old-style water pump
with 2 year warranty)

As for the others, I ordered some stuff from Vertex last year and it
was a huge hassle.  They quoted me quite high prices on everything
that wasn't listed in their ad, and I had to talk them down part by
part including quoting the names of the vendors who were offering the
part for less.  Even at that, they only _matched_ the prices.  I'll
only do that again as a last resort!

Side Note: If any of you in/around Vancouver, BC want to hear a local
mechanic horror story--drop me a note.

Anyhow, that's all my mailorder experiences of the part year or so.  I
hope it helps...
