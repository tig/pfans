My 86 951 had a SACH's clutch in it as standard equipment.  The clutch plate 
had a steel center, four or five springs, and I shattered the hub on a normal
shift from 3rd to 4th at Sebring under full acceleration (except during the
shift).  Rubber centered clutches were in 944s, but not 951s.  Porsche split
the cost of the repair under warrantee even though track driving was disclosed
and clutches were specifically excluded from warrantee.  That led me to
believe there was a manufacturing defect.

During that service discussion, slipping the clutch was the number 1 way to
ruin it.  The material separates from the clutch disk.  Apparently a number of
people had tried that approach.  I was given the impression that just one time
could do it.

It cost about $1800 to fix in 1987.

My uncle is in the market for his first Porsche.  He's looking at an 86 944
Turbo that a local (Memphis) Porsche mechanic is selling.  Since I live in
Florida, I won't have a chance to look at it, and I thought I might solicit
the advice of the list.  Here are the details on the car:

$8500

132K Miles.
Red / Tan.
Paint in very good condition except for several rock chips.
Interior in very good condition except for a seam splitting between the
leather and the cloth inserts.
Chipped.

Recently replaced:
- Timing belt
- Tires
- A/C Compressor
- Crankshaft seals
- Oil pan gasket
- Tensioner pulley
- Motor mounts
- Clutch
- Water pump
- Wheel bearings
- Brakes
- Windshield

He has driven the car and he said it feels very tight.  Naturally, he is
concerned about the mileage, although it looks like most of the problem
spots have been covered.  Should he stay away from this car?  (BTW, He won't
be doing any of the maintenance / repairs himself.)  Is the price reasonable?

He is planning on having the car checked out by an independent mechanic.
Any recommendations for the Memphis area?

Thanks for any advice,
Brian.
