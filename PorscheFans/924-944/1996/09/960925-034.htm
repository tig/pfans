I've seen posts where people are paying HUGE money for a wheel
alignment. Here in Calgary I typically pay $32 CDN or about $25 US for a
four wheel alignment. I insist on a print out of the before and after
specs for my records so I know what has been done. I've seen many prices
for an alignment in the $100 US or more and can't understand why? Am I
missing something or is there something more to it?
