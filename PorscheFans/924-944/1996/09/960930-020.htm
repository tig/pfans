James,

I had similar symptoms at 3050 rpm. I had the belts replaced and checked. The 
transmission had recently been reworked. The clutch had been changed and still the 
anoying vibration. After the clutch change the vibration diminisher by about half. The 
flywheel was machined and I think that had something to do with it. I even had the 
Porsche Canada service rep drive the car. He thought it was exhaust related. That apon 
reflection makes no sense. The problem is still not resolved but it must be the flywheel. 
Maybe that is your problem to.

Sorry I don't have a solution but hopefully this will help.

>Hi, Jim

Has any work been done to the motor recently?

A typical problem occurs when the balance shaft pulleys are removed and
not replaced with the proper keyway aligned to the woodruff key on the
balance shaft itself.

The marks on the pulley are O (for ober - upper balance shaft) and U (for
uber - lower balance shaft).

If it feels like there is a vibrator in the shift lever, that's a likely
culprit...

Good Luck!
