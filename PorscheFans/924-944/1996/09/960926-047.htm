Please do not compare my posts to those of T*d.  I read through some of
his old posts and if you think for a second that I am that arrogant or
a know-it-all, you have read my posts completely wrong or I have written
them completely wrong.  I cannot believe the answers he gave people!

I will always give out my impression of a mod or a change I've made in
my car and like I've said previously, sometimes they will be good, sometimes,
things might break.

When I gave the tire description, those were from my Talon and currently,
the Dunlop's on the Porsche.  Anyone who has tried those tires will surely
stand behind what I said as being truthful, so please do not compare me
to T*d.

The fact that I've stayed this long getting flamed tells you that I am
dedicated to learning as much as I can about the 944 Turbo.  I like to
know when something I've said is dead wrong, but like I said before,
explain it rather than just flame, it does everyone a lot more good.

If we can't get around this, then let me know and I'll unsubscribe.  It's
unusual for me, I used to be one of the top dogs in the Talon/Eclipse/
Laser list run by Todd Day today@dsm.org.  I have various suspension
setup pages on the Net for the Talon and was generally well respected
by the 1000+ members of the T/E/L list.  To come here and to be humiliated
was rather odd.  I was told that the Porsche crowd was quite different
in their ways, but I didn't think this is what they meant.  Perhaps it's
my young age that doesn't bode well with the generally older crowd
on this list.

There are those who are enjoying my posts, and there are those who snicker
and send snide remarks back.  I really don't know whether to post or not
anymore, it just seems to get worse the more I write.  I really thought
that people would be interested to hear the buildup of my 944 Turbo
in the same way the T/E/L list was interested with the build up of
my Talon, but maybe I was wrong.
