I believe the idea to change the reply-to names is excellent.  I only have
one minor thing to add:  My mail folder filter is the elm filter and it does
not allow filtering based on the Cc: field.  Since we are trying to make our
life easier, how does the rest of the list feel about using the To: field
(instead of the Cc: field)  for the porsche list address when feasible?  Or
maybe I am wasting bandwidth.  Just a thought, I still agree wholeheartedly
with Mr. Lommatzsch's idea.
