I am definitely for real, I even put up pics of my car on the web.  I
have a feeling you meant this for private email, but since you posted it
to the list, I will answer your questions and/or rude comments.

I am not on my way to destroying a perfectly good Porsche.  I am just
enhancing the performance of these fine machines.  You have to understand
that regardless of the badge on the car, it's still a car.  Adding a 
MAF sensor is not a way of destroying an engine.  I have taken the time
to speak with many shops as well as racers from around the world to 
determine what is the best upgrade path, then by taking their advice,
I will try them and report them to the list.

Bright, but a bit clueless?  You don't get a 4-cylinder 2.0L motor into
the 12's by being clueless.  I'll admit that I don't do most of the
work on my own car, but I sure as hell set the suspension and power
upgrades up myself.  My suspension design Talon took FTD at the local
autocross this last weekend.  If you think I'm a figment of my own
imagination, ask Wesley SHew who is on this list who was also out at
this weekend's auto-x and came in second behind the Talon 0.9s
back.

How does one acquire such money at a young age?  Education I guess would
be the answer, along with great determination to own a Porsche.  I 
currently work for a large telecom company in B.C. called BC Tel.  I
am a systems support person or my official title is "Application Support
for Business Internet" which is the high speed internet division of
BC Tel.  I support the problems that occur from us selling T1 and Fibre
connections to customers.  This may not be brain surgery, but it does
require some brain power.  BTW - I don't make tons of cash, if I did,
I would have put the MAF in and the K27 without asking anyones opinions.
The fact that I'm asking and sharing information should tell you that
I don't have money to burn, but rather to spend wisely.

Anyways, enough arguing over the list for this week.  If you have anything
further to say, take it private email to me.  Thanks.

Farzaan.
1989 Porsche 944 Turbo S - 14psi.
