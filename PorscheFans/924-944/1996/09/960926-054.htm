        Some of us are nuts about our Porsche while others are very
knowledgable about P cars and some of us are just learning about how much
these 4 wheeled toys/mydailycar can really cost.  
        I've been very lucky with my 83 944.  I bought it at 72k (95k now)
and have spent an enormous amount of time under the car with a Haynes manual
so much so that my wife thought I left her (just joking dear).  
        A clutch job (I learned in the Haynes) is a very time consuming job
and when I looked up in Excellence/Tweeks/Performance/Automotion and saw the
costs and at $80/hr. for the P mechanic I gulped hard.  So, back under the
car I went to measure the slave cylinder etc. 
        I really appreciate my car.  It took me ten years to find the RIGHT
car and I'll be damned if I'm gonna drop/slip/abuse the clutch or any other
part just to get some smoke.  (Yes I have lit the tires a couple of times
and I got sideways going into third on wet road the other day, but 90% of
the time its easy but not necessarily slow.)  
        Which brings me to a question.  The manual says 130MPH top speed,
OK.  As far as I know I don't have a after market chip, and definately no
header, or trick exhaust, etc.  So, is 140+MPH out of line (5600RPM)(heart
rate 120)? Flat highway no tail wind and speedo wasn't shaking. I looked at
the transmission diagram and they seem to matche up.
        I have learned a huge amount here and would hate to see this
resourse , the people how answer our questions, for so many of us disappear.

Keep the Kool
