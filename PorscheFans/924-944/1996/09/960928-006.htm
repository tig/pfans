My 85.5 has had various shakes, rattles, and vibrations, but the one that
bugs me the most comes on right at 3900 RPM and disappears after 4100 RPM.
It's the power steering pump on my car- the bracket is cracked and the pump
is vibrating at high RPM.  I also had a problem with the A/C compressor-
both bolts had sheared, leaving the compressor hanging by the belt and
friction.  Check both of those and make sure the belts are tight.  See if
you can eliminate the compressor from the equation by testing with it both
on and off.  I also had to replace both motor mounts since they were the
old style and replace them with new turbo mounts.  To test the power
steering pump theory, one option is to just remove the fan belt and drive a
short distance at that RPM range.  I wouldn't drive very far since I don't
particularly go for the idea of a power steering rack going without its
pressurized oil.  I hope some of this is useful!
