Just as a recap of whats been done to the car for those who are coming up
with all sorts of wierd ideas about me wanting a $900/month maintenance
bill, etc.

The car only has a boost chip in it that raises boost to 14psi right now.
It tapers off to 12psi at really high RPM.  I tried the Weltmeister chip
and found no real gain from the chip I already had.  Since I intend on
putting on a K27-8 turbo on in the future, Powerhaus recommended that
I return the Weltmeister chips and go for the MAF sensor from Autothority
because they can reprogram the chips for minimal cost when I put the
bigger turbo on.  

The reason why I bought this car was to avoid the $900/month bills the
Talon was generating and so far, it's working great.  This month,
only maintenance bill was an oil change to synthetic and a tranny
oil change to synthetic.  I had a leaking water pump, but that was
covered under my warranty.  I also had my timing belts done at the
same time which was minimal in cost.

Here's an interesting thing I noticed when I changed the tranny oil 
to synthetic.  There is a grinding sensation from the rear LSD when
taking off with the synth oil in there.  My theory is that it is
able to make the differential much more effective thus creating this
"locked" diff kind of sensation.  The shifting is much easier now
though.  I am going to try Redline gear oil (I am going to call
Redline to see if they recommend it's use in a Porsche trans) and
see if I can get the tight rear end without the grinding feel.  The
other person I race with (1988 944 Turbo S) also has this grinding
feel when he changed to synthetic.  Is Swepco synthetic?

For those who believe that my Porsche is a "figment" of my own
imagination, here is the address for the pics again:

Do any of you guys autocross at Kent or Bremerton?  It would be
interesting to see how I do against other Turbo S's.  Let me know.

Farzaan.
1989 Porsche 944 Turbo S - 14psi.
