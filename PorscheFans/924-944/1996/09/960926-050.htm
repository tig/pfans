You're gonna have lotsa fun with this one...

The mirror is attached to the mount by a hollow bolt kept under tension by a
thick
coaxial spring. If you flip the mirror back and forth too much, it is
possible to
eventually unscrew the bolt, losing all tension. The only thing holding your
mirror
on now are probably the wires (for heating and mirror motors) which run thru the
hollow bolt. Here's what I did when mine came loose:

- Remove the inner door panel to get at the nuts holding the mirror mount to
the door.

- Undo the nuts and completely remove the entire mirror assembly from the
car. You'll
  probably have to cut the wires so mark them before hand. Watch the area
around the gasket
  between the mount and the door...it is easy to scratch the paintwork if
there is accumulated
  dirt.

- With the wires cut, it should be easy to separate the mirror unit from the
mount.

- The trick now is the screw the hollow bolt back in, while applying enough
pressure to
  counteract the spring. If you've got strong fingers give it a try.

  After giving it some thought, I resorted to using a long thin threaded
bolt with washers.
  By passing the this bolt thru the hollow bolt, I could tighten a nut on
the thin bolt and
  slowly 'pull' the two pieces together until the hollow bolt made contact
and I could
  screw it into the mount. Tip: choose the length of this thin bolt
carefully; if it is too
  long, you won't be able to get it out once you've screwed in the hollow bolt.

Good Luck.
