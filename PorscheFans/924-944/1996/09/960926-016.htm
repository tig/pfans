Hi Adam,

I've gone to the cup car 30mm tubular front bar and the 19mm 3-way factory
bar in the rear. Along with the yellow Koni's I've done the 250# springs at
the front and did 28mm torsion bars. It works well on the roads where I live
but I don't think it would be much fun to commute in it if I had to drive
over poorly-maintained interstate or city streets. OTOH, I can still drink
coffee from an open cup while driving without sloshing it all over the place.

The 250# springs have about 56% more rate than the stock springs while the
28mm torsion bars have about 100% more rate than the stock bars. Lots of
people use 200# springs and 26mm torsion bars and this gives about a 25%
increase in the front rate and about 50% in the rear. Either of these combos
will decrease the understeer of the car.

With the rear bar in the center position there is just a hint of oversteer
in the testing I've done so far. I will have it on the track next month at
Roebling for the first time since doing all the mods, so we'll see then.

The car is very flat in the turns but I think probably the biggest impact
came from the increase in size of the torsion bars as the car doesn't squat
as much under boost now, and this makes it more balanced in that state. But
you have to do the front and rear as a unit or you will really have a mess
on your hands (BTDT).

I don't know too much about this but did all the work so if you have questions
yell.

Sorry, can't help you there.
