Sounds like maybe the linkage has come undone back on the transmission
side?  Have you pulled the boot off the shift knob and fiddled with the
linkage?  If it jammed, that might explain why it works fine one minute and
not at all the next.

In the knob and/or linkage you mean?  The more I read, the more it sounds
like that linkage (bar) could be rattling around underneath and causing
your trouble...  Or maybe the throw-out bearing (mine makes some noise).

Hmmm.  That sure doesn't sound like linkage.  Could it be a noise unrelated
to the "locked in gear" problem?

>It sounded
>like the noise that my thunderbird's worn rear u-joint makes.

Maybe it's a combination of CV joints and the linkage coming loose?  Sorry
I don't have any definite answers but you DID ask for any input!  Good
luck!  Be sure to tell us what it is when you figure it out!
