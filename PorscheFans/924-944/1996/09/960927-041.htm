My understanding is that the ABS warning light means that something didn't
check out to the computer's satisfaction during its test or while driving.
It would *not* be triggered by something like tire pressure, type of pads,
nor bubbles in your brake system.  If the light is on, then it's probably
telling you that the ABS has disengaged itself for some reason-- you might
be on just normal brakes (ie: no ABS assistance) at that point.  This is a
safety feature since if anything were to go wrong, well, you can imagine
having a system which wouldn't let the brake pads compress onto the rotor...

As for what caused it, that's a tough one.  If the ABS computer didn't
think it had enough voltage, for example, it might shut down.  If one of
the wheel sensors didn't read correctly (due to being loose, dirty, or
whatever), that might also make the system flash a light.  Since brakes are
such a potentially dangerous item, ABS systems are more prone to shut down
and leave you on manual than risk it and and end up with a law suit...  So,
there's a chance that it may be nothing.  A few months ago, my wife's 86
Mercedes ABS light did the same thing you described but hasn't come on
since that one incident.  Sorry that most of what I have to offer is what
it likely is not instead of what might have caused it.
