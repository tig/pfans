Pete, what are you talking about?  I gave my experience using those
tires on the Talon.  I have not yet purchased my race rubber for the
Porsche which will likely be the same I ran on the Talon, Hoosier
Radials.  I owned Talons for four years in which I tried many different
brand names.  The only tire I have yet to try for racing is the BFG R1
and the Goodyear GSC-S.  I have a set of GSC-S's ready in my garage,
but they were for the Talon 225/50R16 :(

>ps what is a talon ?

It is a car which was made by the Diamond Star Motors plant in Normal,
Illinois.  The cars were a collaboration of Mitsubishi and Chrysler 
Corporation.  They came with a 2.0L 4-cylinder turbo motor that was
virtually bullet proof.  Your balance shaft assembly is licensed from
Mitsubishi and is the same as found in the Talon, which are also notorious
for breaking timing belts.

The Talon has won 6 or 7 years in a row of its class in the SCCA World
Challenge races.  This was their last year though as Chrysler is 
stopping the sales of the Talon at the end of this year or next and is
putting its efforts into the Dodge Stratus touring car project.  The
Archer Brothers used to campaign the Talons.

This is an excellent idea!  We normally have a softer start to the course,
but I was in charge of running the event and I had told the course 
designer a couple of months back that I wanted a drag race start, because
I had the AWD Talon which was quite productive off the line.  Little did
I know I would be in a 944 Turbo at the event, at which the drag race
start was not so productive.

I also had this happen to me the second day I had my car.  For me it
was a weak battery.  ABS takes a lot of power to operate and I guess the
computer shuts it down if the battery is too weak to operate it safely.
Mine actually shut off after about 10 minuts of driving and the voltage
gauge was back up where it should have been.  I was demonstrating the
power seats to a friend's mother and left the rear window defogger on
without the car on.  This car drains its battery pretty quick.  Next time
it happens, check the battery voltage and see if it was drained by 
something.

Even though this whole clutch thing kind of got blown out of proportion,
it has brought to light a bunch of information that I had not read
previously, so in some cases, this whole flame fest actually produced
some good information.  I just hope it doesn't take a flame fest to get
the same, or better, level of information out in the future.
