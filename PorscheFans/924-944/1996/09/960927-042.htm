I've had good luck with Parts Heaven in Hayward, CA and Best Deal in
Stanton, CA- they seem to have good availability.  AutoAtlanta has a pretty
extensive catalog with a section labeled "944 hard parts", which has
assembly drawings for most of the entire car.  All three of these deal in
used parts.  Of course, I'm on the West coast, so these are the ones I use.
There are others on the East coast if that's closer to you.

PartsHeaven 800-767-7250
Best Deal 800-354-9202
AutoAtlanta 800-P924-944

You might give these three a try.
