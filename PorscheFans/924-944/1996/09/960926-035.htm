Ok, I am now faced with a tough choice. I have just installed the autothority
carbon fiber air intake (a K&N cone filter with a carbon fiber hose to make
it connect to my 968).

Cons:
1) I have talked to a number of people who say that with these cones, after a
hard day of driving or in dusty conditions that if they take their cone off,
they can actually see and feel small particles that made it through the
filter.
2) It seems to be a negative a lower RPMs. Until the engine winds up, it
actually feels like it is costing me a bit.

Pros:
1) IT SOUNDS GREAT! once the RPMs do get moving, it sounds really nice
2) Once the rpms are in the "power range" it feels a little "crisper" and it
seems to rev a little more freely.
3) <i dont know if this is a pro, but it address the first con>, i have been
told by a Porsche mechanic (I think a good one), that the particles that can
make it through that filter that dont get by the stock one are so small it is
not much of a concern, and most (including dust) will probably burn up.

so, I have 30 days to decide. I am getting my autothority chip tomorow and I
will see how that goes with this. Although I love the sound and the higher
rpm feel, if the chip doesnt make it work better at low rpms, I will most
likely have to return it. That is where this car is the most needy. any
comments welcome - Doug
