Just got finished doing my motor mounts this past weekend. The old style
hydraulic mounts (at least the Turbo mounts) are orange on the bottom and had
bolts and nuts that hold them to the motor bosses. 
The new mounts (part # 951 375 042 04) are all black and attach with just
bolts that come thru the top of the engine boss into the mount. There are no
longer any nuts involved. 
BTW this is a hellofajob but can be done with jack stands and lying on your
back. If anyone is interested I took notes and can post the procedure for the
list. 
Interestingly enough my old mount on the right side was so bad that it came
out in two pieces. The car did vibrate at idle but once off idle it was still
reasonably smooth. With the new mounts it feels like a new car especially at
low speeds.
