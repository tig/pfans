I notice this same feeling when I drive my son's car.  I usually hear it
when starting from a stop and turning at the same time.  I do not know if
his car has synthetic oil though.  Re: Redline, I have it in my little
Honda Si and it is great stuff.  I'm not sure that MTL would be the one to
use in a Porsche though.  Redline makes several versions, including MT90
which is roughly equivalent to 10w40 oil, and two others made more for
hypoid type differentials, one for limited slip and one for without.  One
of these should do the trick.

No (not yet anyway), but I'd like to go see you if you do since I live so
close.

I'll be off the list for a few days as we are moving to a new house and I
don't feel like wading through 100s of emails when I finally get the
computer back online.  I hope I don't miss anything too exciting :-)
