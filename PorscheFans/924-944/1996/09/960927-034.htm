Doug,

I don't think that the problem is directly chip related--but it's close.  I
had almost the exact same thing happen to my car about five years ago.  At
the time, it was unchipped--totally stock--and it was the lower radiator
hose that split wide open, allowing the coolant to run out.  I was driving
at high altitude at the time (on the way to Tahoe) so I figure it was
somehow a combination of thinner air, less air pressure (or more?) and an
old hose which needed replacement.  I stopped at a supermarket parking lot
and all this green stuff was running out from under the car.  I got a few
looks, but no fat boy comments (that SUCKS, I hope you flipped that guy
off!).  Anyway, if I was near a decent auto parts store I probably could
have gotten something to serve as a temporary replacement hose and a couple
of clamps, but I was stuck in Pollock Pines, California (which is nice if
you don't have car trouble) and the local shade-tree mechanic just looked
at my car and shrugged his shoulders.  We ended up duct-tapeing what was
left of the hose and I brought about three gallons of coolant in the car
and limped all the way home.  In any case, all it was was a radiator hose.
The fact that there was coolant all over the engine could mean your hoses
or expansion tank may have been weak to begin with, and the chip may have
simply been the coup de grace.

Good luck!
