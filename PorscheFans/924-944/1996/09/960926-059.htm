Of course if we get 400hp in our cars we'll have lots of blown tranny's and
engines. :)


The only car I've gotten to stop-light race has been a '96 mustange gt.  Of
course the huge torque difference killed me...for the first two feet.
 Unfortunately the mustang really isn't much of a competitor.  There has been
some 3000vr4's and supra TTs floating around town.  I'd like to see how our
cars would do against them...

(the only other time I've actually thought about racing someone was when two
guys asked me to go out on a highway and race their pop's 427 corvette
stingray)
