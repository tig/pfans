Hi all

I've noticed water leaking into my 85.5 944 interior. The water seems to come in around the 
footwells near the hatch release button and the same area on the passanger side. 
I did the "hose" test and put the hose down by the base of the windshield, nothing.
I then put it at the top of the windshield so the water could run down the seam between the A 
piller and the windshield. Bingo! it was anchors away in the car.
My question is this: anyone have a clue where this is coming in? is it actually the winshield 
seam or something at the bottom?
A side note is that I used to have an 86 944, this car had a black rubber seal on the outside of 
the windshield. The 85.5 does not seem to have this. I've looked at other 85.5's and they lack 
it as well.

Any help is greatly appreciated!
