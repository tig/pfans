I autocross my 87 951 in the Suncoast Region in Florida. The track we
normally use is MacDill Air Force Base. Our autocrosses are usually on
*large* tracks, but we always use a flying start. The timing equipment is
probably 30 to 50 yards from the launch point. IMHO, it is the only way to
go for saving clutches.
