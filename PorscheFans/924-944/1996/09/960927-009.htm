I had this problem about 4 years ago, and it's not hard to fix but tedious.
Just wish I could remember exactly what I did. There's a spring in there,
and it's probably not broken. The locking nuts on a long threaded sleeve
connecting the mount and the mirror have probably slipped, and the spring
has no tension.  Haynes covers some of the disassembly of the mirror, which
is necessary to get at the nuts. Wish I could be more specific, but suffice
it to say that the problem will become obvious once you get the mirror
apart. Watch out for the plastic bayonet mount - breaks easily - at least
in a late '85. Maybe they upgraded parts in an S2.
