George B @ Ecology 944 takes complete (if not completely intact) 944s and has 
an absolute  complete selection of good used parts.  I have done business with 
him for a year or so, and along with the parts comes some great advice.

(800) ALL-P944

Usual stuff, no business affiliation, just a satisfied customer.
