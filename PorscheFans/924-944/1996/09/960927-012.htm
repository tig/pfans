This flaming crap is getting ridiculous.  I had assumed that a person
with the wherewithal to afford a Porsche would have the wherewithal to
treat others with respect.  However, a couple of individuals here appear
to prefer hiding behind a computer screen and making the kind of snide
remarks to someone they would never repeat to that person's face.  I
enjoy Farzaan's posts and if I didn't, I could simply refrain from
reading them -- so can you!  If he quits the list, no one will benefit
from his experience and that would be our loss.  

Based on the interaction I've had with many of you through private
e-mail, I doubt that as a group we want to see this list deteriorate
into the typical flame laden usenet group that permeates the Internet.
I propose that if someone blatantly flames a list member, they receive a
warning.  Do it again and they're gone.  Bottom line:  don't ruin it for
the rest of us.
