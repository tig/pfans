I had a similar problem with my 85.5- I went somewhere, parked it, went
inside, and when I came out, the car wouldn't fire.  I thought I'd broken
the cam belt or something, but that wasn't it.  After going through a very
good book on Bosch Fuel Injection systems, I finally came to the two
flywheel sensors.  One measures TDC and the other sits above the teeth on
the flywheel.  One of them had gone bad, so I had to replace it.  That was
it!  If you have an ohm meter, check the resistance between any two of the
three leads for each of the two inductive pickups (the sensors).  What
you'll find (if it's the same problem I had) is that, like Sesame Street,
"one of these things is not like the other".  The one which doesn't measure
a resistance between two of the wires-- but where there is resistance on
the other-- is the bad wire.  I got one from a junk yard and haven't had
that problem since.

Now, if your car is an 87 or earlier, the other thing I had happen which
kept the car from firing is the oil-pressure relief valve.  As it turns
out, the car's brain won't fire the plugs unless you're cranking at a
certain RPM.  If you don't reach that RPM, you get absolutely zero spark.
It's weird since, when I had it happen, it was so on or off- no in between,
no weak spark, which told me that it had to be the computer fooling around.
I was eventually able to confirm the minimum RPM theory.  What happens is
that the oil cooler seals start to go and small amounts of water
contaminate the oil in that area, which just happens to be directly above
the oil-pressure relief valve.  When it jams in the open position, you
won't be able to start since the engine is trying to pump 70psi or more of
oil at the same time you're cranking the engine.  If you actually have it
running when it jams, you blow out the side of the oil filter, all over
your exhaust manifold.  Believe me-- it happened to me.

So, if the flywheel pickups check out, check for oil in your water-- early
87 and earlier cars have a retrofit to the newest 1-piece, treated pressure
relief valve.
