It doesn't matter that the belt is being measured in a state it would normally
not be in. What Porsche has done is to specify a method such that measurements
are repeatable if performed correctly. For example, what if I rotated the crank
to TDC slowly (e.g. at 1 rpm) versus whipping it quickly around to TDC (e.g. at
60 rpm) before taking a reading. The inertia introduced by the rapid
deceleration of the crank in the second case (60 rpm to 0 rpm) is likely to 
result in more belt slack and thus give a lower reading.

By reverse rotating the belt, we are eliminating the effects of inertia and in 
effect 'evening' out the tension for a more consistent reading.
