Thx to the list for all the help I got on fixing the side mirror. What a 
bugger to work on, took almost 3 hours. On my 91 S2 you don't have to 
remove the door panel to remove the mirror, just 1 allen head bolt on the 
outside. I did'nt cut the wires either. Basically you have to screw a 
hollow bolt back into the mirror housing. Sounds Easy BUT that bolt has a 
round head AND has a high tension spring pushing it back out of the 
housing. This combination makes it very difficult to start the bolt back 
into the threads of the mirror housing. Looks like the factory has a 
special tool to tighten the bolt, helped along by the fact the wiring is 
not yet routed thru the hollow part and the mirror is off of the car.

My solution was to use a small pr. of needle nose vise grips on the bolt' 
round head giving me leverage to push it down against the spring 
tension. Still the spring was too strong for me to push the bolt down far 
enough to start on the threads. Ended up trying removing first one then 
both plastic washers/spacers on either side of the spring to relieve some of 
it's pressure. Now I could screw the bolt back in. Everything went back 
together ok after that. Although you do have to be extremely careful 
while working on it because you're right next to the bodywork and the 
mirror is dangling inches from the door while resting on your lap 
(Sitting on a stool/chair next to the car). Tension in the mirror now 
while folding forward or back feels  the same as normal. Only drawback is 
there is slightly more up and down play in the housing now with the 
plastic washers removed. But it's very slight and in the normal position 
it doesn't move around.

To avoid this from reoccuring I would recommend not folding the mirror 
when washing the car (and when I auto-x, so I don't see cones behind me 
in my peripheal vision).

Just washed and quick detailed the p-car and it looks so fine!
