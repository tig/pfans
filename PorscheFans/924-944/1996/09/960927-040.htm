My 85.5 had a similar sound (although being normally aspirated it sure
won't go to 135mph!) coming from around the battery area or roughly the
glove box area.  I would have described the sound more like "boiling water"
and it took me a few weeks to figure it out-- it turned out that there is a
rubber frame which is merely pressed into a groove around the windshield
and during certain conditions it would come loose and vibrate in the wind.
You might check to see if that plastic frame is securely seated.  Mine has
dried out and I ended up applying a few drop of silicon sealant to stick it
down and keep it from rattling.

Hope this helps!
