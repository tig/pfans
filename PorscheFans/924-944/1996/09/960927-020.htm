I'll second this. I've had good service from Carlsen. And they will double
check all parts numbers.

On the other hand, I'd advise staying away from Vertex. They've really
screwed me on an engine rebuild, and you have to remind them to return core
charges.  I'm pissed at these people. They deserve to be boycotted.
