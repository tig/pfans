My post was the one that talked specifically about the red mark.  My car is
a 1987 model, I do not know if the red mark on the end of the stud appeared
in the later models only or not.  The 928s are supposed to have these
marks on the rear wheels, too.  BTW, I double checked and on my 87
phone-dial wheels with the 53.5mm offset, the lock does go adjacent to the
valve as there is a stud hole there, ie there is a point on the pentagon
that is marked by the five stud holes there.  It would be impossible on my
wheels to put the lock opposite of the valve.  Of course, YMMV, I have no
experiences with cookie-cutter, flat-dish or other wheels, the stud hole
arrangement there may be different.

Anything I say about finding the stud by doing a balance test would be
guessing.  I do not know about the slot on the dust cap, I will have to
remove a wheel to find out.
