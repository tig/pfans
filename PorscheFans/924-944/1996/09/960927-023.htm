<< You adjust the shocks to affect the handling of the car, not the ride
quality. >>

first, thank you for the reply. As for adjusting for handling, I know that.
What I was saying is that this is still a street car, not a trcak only car. I
will adjust for handling up to a point, if the ride became too harsh (i.e.
F40) I would not be willing to have it that way. Anyway, I was surprised how
nice the ride remained with the stiffer shocks. as for handling, from what I
have found so far it handles pretty well, and the balance seems nice. I
havent had enough track time to tell for sure. I want the front shocks stiff
because the car (as do most 944 types that i know of) has a tendency to try
to "roll over" the outside front wheel in tight corners. when I set those at
this stiffness, it seemed to reduce this a bit. thanks again for the info -
Doug
