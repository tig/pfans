    I have a 88 Turbo S and it tracks perfectly straight and the wheel lock
    does not line up with the valve stem on any of the tires, (BFG COMP's).
    Not sure if this is an aberation or if this is minor issue or more
    noticeable if alignment or tire pressure or something else is off. Is
    this wheel lock recomendation in writing or in a tech note somewhere?

    -Byron

I had my car aligned two months ago, to the tune of $150...  It was OK for a 
while, although it shimmied at about 65 mph.  I took it back to the shop, and 
told the owner that it was off a little, and asked it this was attributable to 
what I had read about the locking lug nut being misplaced, or the wheel being 
balanced without it.

He said he had never heard of that, and had had no mention of it from any 
other customer...

Now, the car shimmes badly at 65-70 and is starting to float.  I have hit no 
major potholes or speedbumps, and do not track or autocross the car.  I drive 
about 10 miles a day to work, round trip.

Could we review the lug nut thread one more time, just so I can be sure when I 
take my car in sometime in the next couple of days, and know exactly what to 
ask for?
