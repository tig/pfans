     I heard a very disconcerting sound last night and wondered if anyone 
     has any insights: I was racing (stupid and childish I know--but I was 
     winning) a new corvette and at approx 120 I heard a loud buzzing sound 
     which seemed to be coming from the passenger-side dash area. The sound 
     is hard to describe but the closest thing I could imagine would be the 
     sound of an enormous bumble bee. It almost sounded electrical like 
     when the ignition buzzer on my triumph was going bad. It didn't sound 
     engine related, but I didn't get to listen to it long before I decided 
     to back off (this was at 135+ I estimate). The car sees 100mph fairly 
     frequently, but above that is pretty rare. I've never heard such a 
     sound and at those speeds any noise is particularly unnerving. I've 
     looked the car over fairly extensively and can't find anything wrong. 
     Could this have just been some sort of strange "reed effect" of the 
     wind rushing between the windshield and the passenger's wiper blade?
     
     Thanks in advance,
     Rod Wiggins,
