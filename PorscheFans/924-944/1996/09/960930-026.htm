O.K.. Most of the Koni info that's been posted is correct. Koni makes single
and double adjustable shocks in both insert and complete strut units.
The singles are as previously posted, top adjustment on the fronts, remove
and twist the rears to adjust(don't forget to remove the bump stop). Konis
were available on some cars as option#474.
The doubles like advertised by Paragon(where I got mine, the only source for
these I know of) are fronts only and were made by Koni Holland for the 951TS.
They fit cars that have the same spindles as the TS. They are the complete
strut units.
You can also have Koni make some doubles for you if you start with the right
shock(not the inserts on the front).
The front doubles adjust like the singles up top, then on the bottom of the
body of the strut, have a 7(if I remember correctly) click position screw you
turn with a large flat blade. The rear doubles twist like the singles and
also have the screw adjuster on the body of the shock.
It's only money!
