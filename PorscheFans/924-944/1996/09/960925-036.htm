Doug, in the 6 years I had my 84 944 I did a total of 2 burnouts, both
of which were very satisfying. I have yet to do a burnout in my 951S,
primarily because I replaced the clutch this spring and am determined
never to have todo that again (what a PAIN in the ass).
However my question is that the 944 has a rubber centred clutch as
opposed to the spring centred unit on the 951S. I assume that the rubber
centred clutch would be more likely to be damaged by a burnout than the
spring centred clutch. Is this the case? Does anyone have any experience
with this?
