    Without the rule, they might.  With the rule, they can't.

    I guess I misunderstood your original question... I thought that
    you were advocating the replacement of the "minimum tire
    diameter" rule with a "maximum footprint size" rule, but it now
    seems that you don't mind keeping the existing rule, so long as
    the legal limit is adjusted downward.  Is that true?

    I hope so, because...

    As I said before, the size of the contact patch doesn't vary
    appreciably with tire size, all else being equal.
