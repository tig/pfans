and it's just working ducky. 

I have a sort of hot rod 356. Can't tell from outside. Original crankcase and
transmission, numbers match if you care about that sort of thing. But it
performs like a more modern car (OK, so it's no 911...) There is some
self-appointed guru in the Bay Area who says that if you do this and that
your 356 will explode in 15K miles. He writes virtually unreadable
vanity-published books, and if you're in the 356 world you know who he is.
Anyway, I have done exactly the things he says don't work, and by his
yardstick, I should have gone through 5 engines by now. Just turned 80K
miles, running just fine. Oh, yeah, the car was Zone 8 Class A/Stock slalom
champion 2 years in a row with that motor and 2 drivers.

Uh, maybe I should undo all the stuff I've done to restore the incredibly
high collector value of a 356 SC coupe? <g>
