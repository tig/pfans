A new hire with an MR2 turbo was asking the same kinds of questions so I bought
him a single board computer with A/D and digital I/O and an LCD interface. The
idea was for him to write all the code to display and log RPM and some pressures
and temperatures and such for later download to a laptop. The data could then
be imported into a spreadsheet and graphed or whatever. He had it all prototyped
but he eventually roasted some silicon on the board (it is a nasty environment
for the digital generation to play in).

Anyway he is still working on it and if he ever gets it done I'll put the
code up on an ftp site. The cool thing about the board was that it was
under $200 and used some tokenized C variant so it could be programmed from
a PC or Mac. It was slow but could log all the stuff we wanted to log at a
5 Hz rate for longer than a run would last.

There are a bunch of embedded guys on the list here so maybe someone has
done something similar. Yell if you are interested and I'll give you the
sources for the SBC he used.
