I am looking for someone who has had a similar problem.


I parked my 944 for 3 days. Yesterday when I went to go somewhere in it,
It started and ran for maybe 3 seconds, then abruptly died. From then 
on, the car would just turn over but not hit. 

I did the usual cussing, then tried to check a few things, loose wires, 
blown fuses. I smell a little gas but not a strong odor. I tried it 
again this morning, same thing. Its been really wet for the past few 
days, but nothing that I would think would cause any problems.

Two weeks ago, I had the belts replaced and the engine tuned. Everything 
checked out fine then. Running perfect up to then.  I have put maybe 50 
miles on it since the tune up.

Any suggestions?


regards,
Brent Smith
