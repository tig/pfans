     Hello P-fans!
     
     I'm trying to find the best place to pick up miscellaneous interior 
     parts for my 88 944. I need to get a driver's side power window switch 
     place (the thing that holds the pw switches). Also, does anyone know 
     where to find out what type of screws are used in mounting the 
     interior moldings? Apparently some work was done on the sunroof and 
     they could not figure out what happened to some of the screws. I went 
     to a dealer and they could not tell me. 
     
     Also, my offer still stands to send the p-philes message archives to 
     anyone who wants them. Just let me know. I have 90-94 and am working 
     on getting 95 (thanks to Shrikumar ;-))
     
     It's been six months since making my purchase. Reading all those 
     messages sure can make someone PARANOID. This newsgroup is great and I 
     hope to help contribute from a "newbie" perspective. 
     
     
     Thanks to all,
     
     Chris Cyr
     88 944
