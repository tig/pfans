The oil return line from the turbo to the sump is removed at the turbo end
by removing the large hex collar closest to the engine, not the hex fitting
on the turbo oil drain housing.  If you manage to turn the fitting at the
oil drain housing you will likely do damage to the oil return line.  You
should put a wrench on both and turn only the hex collar while holding the
other wrench stationary.  It's a toughy, but that collar will come off with
enough coaxing (and swearing).

Have you been able to remove the oil supply?  It's the line going in at the
top of the turbo housing.  I've found that one to be nearly impossible to get
a wrench on it, and that's were the oil always seems to leak first.
