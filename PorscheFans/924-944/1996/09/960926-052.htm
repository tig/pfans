There's been a lot of discussion on clutches, fried and otherwise, drag strip
or slalom launch technique, and the like.

Farzaan said in a private post (which I suppose it's OK to quote) that he

didn't >want to launch at a lower rpm for fear of the car actually hooking up

Well, different people differ in what they think is a good launch technique.
Car and Driver apparently revs a car up to redline, holds it at the rev
limiter and then sidesteps the clutch. They break a lot of cars, too. 

I do it differently and in 9 years and some 250 cars, I've never yet burned
out a clutch on a production car. Did burn out a Centerforce on some tuner
AWD Mitsubishi Galant but I suspect I wasn't the first to do so. (Many tuner
cars are "developed" by unsuspecting magazine testers...)

Anyway, for a Turbo, like Farzaan's, here's what I do. Clutch down, engine at
idle. Stomp on throttle, wide open. When revs come up through some midrange
rpm chosen as launch rpm, get off clutch. Don't let it snap, just engage
quickly (as Farzaan said, "quickly, but firmly pulled up the clutch foot.")
If the engine revs drop, you picked too low an rpm. If it continues to climb
without hesitation, too high an rpm (and danger of slipping clutch). If the
revs hang momentarily then pick up, you've found the right rpm. 

This method really puts very little strain on the clutch. It's either in or
it's out. There will be tire slip for most cars (unless you have a lot of
sticky tire) and of course it suddenly loads the drive shafts but it's not a
shock load like you get from sidestepping the clutch. 

Here's the rationale. Holding a turbo engine at a steady, high rpm doesn't
get air moving through it. The throttle needs to be just barely cracked to
get 6000 rpm with no load. You're basically just overcoming internal friction
and it doesn't take much power to do that. So you want the engine under load.
Because it takes a while (from a short while to an eternity, depending on the
turbo installation) for a turbo to get air moving through the engine, you
can't expect to snap the throttle open as the clutch is released and have
full power instantly. It might take a half second to a second and that's
wasted time. But if you tromp the throttle at idle, you have all the throttle
opening you can have and it starts the air moving through the system. Inertia
keeps revs from going through the roof instantly; you have a second or two to
watch the tach and "catch" the revs by releasing the clutch. So you have
maximum airflow, wide open throttle, and the rpm for maximum torque. You let
the tires slip, not the clutch.

The reason revving the piss out of it at high idle and dumping the clutch
works at all is because that way, you store energy in the rotating masses
(flywheel etc) and then suddenly withdraw it, lurching the car forward, but
it's not steady state power and when the lurch is gone, you still need to
make power the normal way. And that might take a moment if the throttle has
just been opened. 

Of course, you could get really abusive and tromp on the throttle at idle and
wait to  sidestep the clutch just before the rev limiter cuts in, thus
getting max airflow and stored energy in flywheel, but I for one am not that
brave. 

Testing a normally aspirated car, I don't start out with full throttle at
idle rpm, I hold the rpm at about the desired launch rpm (usually never more
than 4000 rpm unless it's a really tiny car with a tweedy little engine) then
simultaneously let the clutch out and mash the throttle. Basically what you
would do on the street anyway. A normally aspirated car doesn't take nearly
as long to build up airflow as a turbo, so I can get away with this.

Farzaan, since you are in an analytical mood, try the floor-it-from-idle-rpm
and let us know how it works out. Try 3000 rpm as a starting point, adjust up
or down from there.
