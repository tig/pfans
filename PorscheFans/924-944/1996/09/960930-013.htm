You have part of this right.  You can stiffen the rear roll rate which 
actually reduces rear traction until you achive the balance that you are 
looking for.  The bad side to this approach is that you are limiting the 
overall grip of the car.  Another aproach is to reduce the roll-over affect 
on the front without stiffening the front shocks and inducing understeer;  
You need to add some more negative camber to the front alignment.  This will 
allow the tire outside front tire to run flatter and generate more grip.

Another related modification for the understeer (does not help roll-over) is 
to adjust the steering ackerman.  I am new to my Porsche and am not sure if 
this is adjustable on our cars in the conventional sense.  It can be 
adjustested as a dependant characteristic of changing the toe in the front.  
Toe the front tires in a bit and you will increase grip in the front while 
reducing initial steering response.  Or you can go the other way and have 
quick turn in with toe out and reduce overall front grip... great for tight 
turns and bad for sweepers.

Let me know if you need more info.
