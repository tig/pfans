I've been trying to figure out this problem too - also not on the track,
but on familiar mountain curves. Please correct any errors here, but my
impression of my S2 is that it understeers in a fast curve, and throws the
weight on the outside front tire, which will roll-over sometimes at factory
spec 36 psi. A natural tendency is to want to reduce body roll and keep
that weight off by setting the front Koni yellows to full stiffness. This
will reduce transient body roll, but increase the understeer.  Likewise,
the temptation to increase front tire pressure to prevent roll-over will
also increase understeer. Therefore, one solution is to stop stiffening up
the front and play with the rear. I just put a 968 19 mm rear sway bar on,
replacing the soft 16 mm, left the front bar at the stock 26 mm, set the
front Konis to about 50-60% full stiff.  Now I've got less body roll and a
little oversteer, or at least the oversteer can be more easily induced.
Just enough that the front end isn't twitching on the outside front tire.  

 I assume I could further increase oversteer if I increased stiffness in
the rear shocks, which are now at about 40%.  This sound right?
