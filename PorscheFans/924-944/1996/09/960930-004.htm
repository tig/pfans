Hello P-fans,

My name is Steven Verona.  I joined the list a few weeks ago and have 
been lurking and reading Farzaan's posts with interest (keep up the good 
work).  Anyway, I race SCCA autox throughout the midwest and I consider 
myself to be a nationally competitive driver.  I had been campaigning an 
86 Audi 4000 quattro and winning a lot of races.  The car just was not 
quite capable of winning nationally and it was too slow for my thrill 
threshold (is this a term?).

I looked at a lot of cars and bought a 90 944 S2 with the M030 and 
Limited slip red/black from another SCCA autoxer, Byron Short.  I love 
the car, it is AWESOME.  I tell people that it defies the Laws of Physics 
and that the car and I "have bonded".

The people on the quattro list loved hearing about my racing.  I am 
curious if people on this list are interested?  If so, I will start 
posting race results and info on set-ups.

BTW, I ran the car in KY for the BF Goodrich Central Division Series 
Championship race and kicked major butt!  I won my class by over 1.5 
seconds and I beat all the cars in the class above (A stock) and almost 
beat all the Super Stock cars (I know I would have beaten them if I ran 
in the afternoon.  The temp was 58 when I ran versus 76 when they ran.)

Let me know.
