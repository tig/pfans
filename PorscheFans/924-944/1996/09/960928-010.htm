For those following my recent coolant leak. Today, I drove the car out of my
garage and filled it up with water. I looked for obvious leaks. there was
none. I let it run to warm up (checking the gauge constantly!) it was running
at normal operating temp and looked fine. Inside the engine bay there were
stains all over the passanger side (opposide side from were you fill the
coolant) from the coolant. Boy does that stuff make an awful smell, cooked
coolant, yuck! anyway, I couldnt see anything lose or burst. Oh yea, I didnt
mention there was no liquid that I could see whatsoever before I put the
water in today. ok, I went in the car and just took it up to about 2000rpm
for a few seconds. it was still at normal temp. then it went a bit higher and
the fan came on...then after a bit more time at idle, the temp shot up! I
immediatly shut off the car before the temp went into the red. ok, still no
visable sign of the leak, but I could see some water on the ground. I rolled
the car back a bit and there was now a huge puddle under the car. So, the
leak in on the passenger side. it is towards the bottom of the car, and this
time it just leaked out, but yesterday it shot up becuase the coolant was all
over the block and the passenger side of the engine bay. you can see all sort
of stains on the inside of the hood from it. I think I can even tell exactly
were it sprayed up. So, here are my questions. My dealer is about 20 minutes
away, mostly highway. If I fill it up with coolant and take extra with me in
the car in case it dump it, do you think I can drive it there. I would hate
to pay for a tow. also, I now know a good Porsche mechanic in town (thanks to
the people on the 911 list), but I think I should take this to the dealer
since they just did a service 3 days ago I feel they would be cheaper. After
all, if a hose was warn out or loose, they should have picked that up. after
this though, i think i will go with some better, braided hoses. BTW, the
mechanic is a little bit longer drive than the shop. thanks again for reading
this, and to all of you who have offered advice. - Doug
P.S. to my friend Chris, you were right about the sound of the K&N, I bow to
you my lord :o)
