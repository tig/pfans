How did it sound? was it battery related? If it is not getting enough power
to turn over, I have had the same problem when my cars sits (of course I have
a after market stereo which doesnt help and a power top). These engines take
a lot to turn over. I have had my car without enough power to turn over, but
it would still run the top up and down. go figure. anyway, I am always
worried when I let my car sit. I have a trickle charger I use (cigarette
lighter one only), but it seems to do the trick.I hope you dont have a
serious problem! it may just be some hose that was loose or something like
that. If it goes into the shop make sure they do a power drain test (I forgot
what the exact name of the test is). best of luck - Doug
