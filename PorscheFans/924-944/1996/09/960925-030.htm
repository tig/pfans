I adapted this article for our club newsletter. I thought others might be
interested.

I also have a question. I obtained a new set of R1's for use in a track
event in tow weekends. BFG recommends "scuffing" in the tires through at
least one heat cycle for max traction and wear. Without track access and
cool midwest temperatures, I'm at at loss as to how to approach this. Advice
would be appreciated.

 Don't just Jump Start

adapted by David I. Johnson

Suddenly your car won't start. What kind of test can I use to help me diagnose the problem. Traditionally a hydrometer to measure specific gravity is used. However this test may not indicate other internal problems. This requires an Open Circuit Voltage or "OCV" test with a good digital voltmeter(+/- 0.50% or less under DC Voltage) with the key off(minimal voltage drain).

The battery is in its highest state of charge when the specific gravity is highest. Typically 1.265 represents a 100% charge down to 1.12 for no charge. Remember that this needs a temperature correction.   At the batteries highest charge, the OCV of 12.66 should be a 100% charge down to 11.89 for 0% charge.

If the OCV reading is in the 10's, but the hydrometer reads high then a shorted cell is a possibility. If this occurs the battery cannot be jump started with the battery in the vehicle. The sorted battery pulls too much current from the source battery through the jumper cables which are now acting as resistors to dropo the voltage to the shorted cell. The solution is to replace the battery. 

If the OCV rating is very low, the problem maybe in the series connectors between the cells. Jump starting of the vehicle will work, but the charging voltage goes up drastically similar to operating an alternator without a battery. The result can be expensive. The hydrometer still says that the battery is charged. Don't throw it out if you can access the cells because it still shows the level of charge. 

So buy a good voltmeter and test your battery before jump starting. The gauge is useful for many other diagnotic stuff on your computer wonder.
