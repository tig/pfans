First off, I want to thank Gregor Diseth, George Beuselinck, Doug Donsbach
and John Lowe for their responses. Indeed, the mini-panel that holds the
switch assembly is held in place with two Phillips screws.  I did not take
the assembly apart yet due to melancholy, but it should be very easy to do. 
Once with the car in front of me, it was obvious as to what it was I had to
do. 

The resolution of the failure was that I went to pick up my car from the
shop and both windows were up, the switches were working fine. :-)) Still, I
will take apart the assembly and check it out.

The real bummer of the deal was that the shop discovered a bad front right
ball joint.  I wish I had bought the #61 Excellence issue since Jim Pasha
had done an article on control arms.
