     Farzaan and 951 autocrossers,
     
     IMHO, 951's are difficult to autocross when compared to 944S2's. Turbo 
     lag is an obvious deficit, but one of the primary advantages of the S2 
     is it's lower gearing. The S2 has a final drive ratio of 3.899:1 while 
     the Turbo's use 3.375:1. I read about a 951S that did the S2 ring and 
     pinion swap and the acceleration numbers were improved dramatically. 
     It don't remember the exact numbers, but this is an almost guaranteed 
     way to drop ET numbers in the quarter mile. It should also require 
     less clutch or tire slippage to launching the car.
     
     When I have autocrossed against Turbo's with my S2, they are usually 
     having to go back and forth between 1st and 2nd while I stay in 2nd. 
     Part of this is the broad torque range of the S2, and part is gearing.
     
     I put Valvoline synthetic in my transfer case and noticed that the LSD 
     chattered in corners. I later added a LSD additive and the noise 
     disappeared. LSD additives contain friction modifiers to smooth out 
     the action of the LSD clutch plates. Redline makes a version that 
     includes the LSD additive.
     
     Farzaan, I say you should add a gearing change to your list of mods 
     especially if you are planning to do much autocrossing and also want 
     to measure performance improvements at the drag strip. One down side 
     is that is that your top speed will be limited to around 150mph, but I 
     don't know how much of a drawback that would be in Canada? You'll need 
     more than just added horsepower to catch Wes Shew in his S2 :-)
