Rod, I've had my 951S up to speeds well over 100 mph - what is the top
end again? ;-)  while in Montana and have never had a problem with the
wipers. 

My lament is that I ran a Nissan 300 zx Twin Turbo recently and couldn't
keep up. I saw some kind of an aftermarket performance sticker on his
tail so I'm assuming it was chipped (mine isn't - yet). Does anyone know
what kind of performance a 300 zx twin turbo has when chipped?
