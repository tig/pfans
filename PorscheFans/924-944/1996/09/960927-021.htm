I've been following the whole thread for a while and the comparison with The
T*d seems to be bugging Farzaan. Some of this criticism comes from people who
could take T*d's place. Farzaan may do stuff with his car that we wouldn't
consider doing to our own, but that's his choice and it's not up to us to say
it's wrong or dumb. And as somebody else pointed out, he apparently can
drive, which is more than could be said for The T*d. He also doesn't get his
tie caught in the fan belt and then tell the whole list, he doesn't lock his
keys in the car and tell the whole list, he doesn't curb surf and tell the
whole list, he doesn't try to sell some recently unbent wheels that only leak
a little bit to the whole list...  And he doesn't give out stupid advice. So
go easy on him. If Farzaan wants to be at the cutting edge (bleeding edge?)
of what you can do to a 951, we should welcome this information.

So failing further evidence to the contrary (like a really entertaining but
chaotic slalom run, witnessed by several on the list, and being beaten by a
couple first-timers in a stock 911T) let's give Farzaan the benefit of the
doubt.
