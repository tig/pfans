Hi Doug,

You adjust the shocks to affect the handling of the car, not the ride quality.

When I first got my car I did the same thing as you, set the front shocks
at full stiff. The result was that the car understeered much more than
I liked. At autocross events and on the track, the car did not want to
turn. I had the front shocks too stiff.

I then adjusted the shocks to about 2/3 stiff. Now the car is nicely balanced.
Turn in is much better. 

I now use just slight adjustment in tire pressure to tune the car for
the specific track that I'm at. Tire wear and temps are good.

So, to recap, you have to drive on a skidpad, or something like that
in order to determine how to adjust the front shocks.

Or maybe I'm wrong (like about the Swepco) and some one else will 
correct me!
