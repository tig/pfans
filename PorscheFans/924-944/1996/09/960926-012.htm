FWIW, I enjoy reading Farzaan's posts on upgrading the performance of
his 951.  Although I too have an 89 Turbo S (USA model) and would
appreciate more power (again, who wouldn't...), I think it would be
better for me to work on the suspension and associated tuning first,
and then do some power upgrades (after Farzaan figures out all the
details :-)).

Not having yet received the May 94 copy of Excellence with Jim Pasha's
article on suspension mods, does anyone have some general suggestions
and/or recommendations?  I've talked to both Windward and PowerHaus and
the general consensus was that upgrading the front and rear anti-sway
bars to 30mm hollow/22mm solid respectively was the way to go.  My car
already has the adjustable Koni struts/shocks, but I was thinking of
going along the lines of a coil-over suspension package, which would
probably mean replacing the Konis with something new.  I'm looking for
something that I can use for both the track and autocrossing, and
as well I use my car as a daily driver - so it has to be streetable.

Also, has anyone had any experience with the suspension design
software as advertised on http://www.rahul.net/dennisp/suspension/ ?

On a totally different topic, someone was inquiring about synthetic
transmission fluid.  I replaced whatever was in my car last fall with
RedLine (MTL I think - don't remember exactly offhand, but it's the
one that works with LSDs).  Definitely worth doing, as the shifts
are much easier and the syncros mesh faster.  I haven't noticed any
grinding noise under hard acceleration.

Thanks again for any advice,
Adam.
