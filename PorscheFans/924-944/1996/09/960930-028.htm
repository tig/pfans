All too true- but what I would really like for someone to confirm is
whether there has been a factory update which was put out *after* the
manuals which supercedes these instructions.  Again, this particular
mechanic insists that this was a technical bulletin from Porsche.  Maybe
I'll have to see if I can get a copy, unless someone else out there in the
group has access to one and can confirm this...

The other thing that bothers me about this reverse rotation is that the
engine will never (well, it better not) rotate counter-clockwise, so what
is it we're trying to measure: tension or slack?  If we're measuring the
tension, then it seems to me that you would never want to counter-rotate
the crankshaft since this would put the belt in a position it would never
see.  Does this make sense to anybody else out there?
