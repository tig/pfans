The most common upgrades for the 300ZX TT are the Jim Wolf Technology
computer.  Basically, it pushes the boost up to 14psi and increases
the fuel output.  This will bring the car into the 13's with trap
speeds of 108mph on street tires and pump gas.  A little bit of tuning
and race gas will allow the car to run 110-112mph in the 1/4 mile.
A few guys on the Z-car list had theirs dyno tested and the number
396 sticks in my mind which I am assuming is flywheel HP.

If the person has upgraded his intercoolers, intercooler pipes, 
compressor bypass valves, exhaust, air intake assembly and changed
the air metering to a speed density using an HKS VPC, you can expect
this car to have an trap speed of 116-120mph, but this almost always
requires race gas.  A stock Turbo S should be 100mph in the 1/4 and
a chipped one should be approx. 104mph-106mph.  A MAF car should
be 106-108.  As you can see, it would be difficult to reach the same
level of straight line performance of a 300ZX TT.  The 300 is notorious
for bad launches though as it is a very difficult to launch car, 
similar to our 951's.  The 300ZX does feel quite floaty at speed though.

If I remember right, Powerhaus's 2.8L monster 944 Turbo did a 118mph
in the 1/4 on pump gas and street tires, which as you can see, is
very impressive.  The general rule of thumb is that every 1mph
you gain in the 1/4, if all else is equal is 10hp at the flywheel.

It's difficult to use that rule when the engine displacement has changed
though, since the torque curves, or as most tuners call it, the area
under the curve has changed dramatically.
