First Buyer Questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


What should I look for, do, or ask about, when considering a prospective ca=
r?

Complete maintenance records.  These cars will treat you very badly if you=
=20
don't take care of them.  Correcting one or two problems that the previous=
=20
owner skipped can easily surpass any cost savings you may have received by=
=20
buying a car that was not maintained regularly.

Find a nice car.  If the car looks good and is well taken care of, the odds=
=20
are the rest of the mechanical bits were well taken care of as well.  Some=
=20
models are rarer then others, but generally there are a great deal of water=
=20
coolers out there.  Take your time, and find a great one.

Pre-sale inspection.  Unless you're a Porsche mechanic, you should invest t=
he=20
$75-100 to take your prospective car to one and have them look at it.  This=
=20
will give you an excellent idea of what sort of costs you will be incurring=
=20
over the next year or so, or even if the car is worth buying at all.


How do I tell if the 944 I'm looking at is early or late 1985?

Early 944's have the 924 instrument cluster.  It's more boxy/squarish then =
the=20
newer 944 panel.  The suspension arms on the early 944's were made of steel=
=20
with replaceable ball joints.  Later 944's use aluminum arms with non-
removable ball joints.  To identify the vehicle for sure, you can examine t=
he=20
VIN number.  Early 944's had a VIN series beginning with 94FN47, later cars=
=20
began with 94FN45 (the VIN tag is located on the driver's side windshield=
=20
pillar by looking down from outside the car).


What is a 951?  Is this some Porsche I haven't heard of before?

No, it's simply the factory designation for the 944 Turbo.



What are common failure modes, and how are hard/expensive are they to fix?

Timing Belt
It's important to have the belts replaced and tensioned regularly.  If the=
=20
timing belt fails, your valves will be bent and you're in for a very expens=
ive=20
repair.  Tensioning the timing belt requires an expensive special Porsche=
=20
tension gauge, some owners use the more traditional "by hand" method withou=
t=20
any adverse affects but the general consensus is "better safe than sorry". =
=20
1987 and later 944's have a tensioning device built in that allows you to=
=20
perform this operation without the special gauge.  Early belts are prone to=
=20
failure, the updated part number has a .02 suffix.

Motor Mounts
If you have excessive vibration at idle and the vibration disappears around=
=20
1200 RPM, one or more of your motor mounts may be bad.  The mounts have bee=
n=20
through several designs, when updating your mounts, make sure you're gettin=
g=20
the newest version (p/n 951 375 042 04) from the 944 Turbo.  The bolt lengt=
hs=20
have also changed with the updated part, so check for updated hardware.  Th=
e=20
right (exhaust side) mount takes the most punishment and usually goes first=
.. =20

The repair is within the reach of the accomplished backyard mechanic, but=
=20
requires some tools, skills and patience.  Motor mounts may "look" OK and=
=20
still be bad.  The normal advice is to look for fluid leakage.  However,=20
usually the fluid has leaked and evaporated long ago.  A better way to chec=
k=20
the mounts is to fashion a [ shaped piece of stiff wire so that the points =
of=20
the wire are 60 mm apart.  Use this gauge to measure the distance between t=
he=20
top and bottom surfaces of the mounts.  If it is less then the 60 mm, repla=
ce=20
them.  If you have an older 944 and it's vibrating, replacing the mounts wi=
ll=20
make you feel like you have a whole different car.  Europroducts is the one=
 of=20
the cheapest sources of mounts at $110/each.  Their number is 800-962-0911.

Water Pump
If you notice any noise or leaking from your water pump it is probably bad =
and=20
should be replaced right away.  If the pump fails entirely the fluid may le=
ak=20
on your belts and they will need to be replaced as well, or if the pump sei=
zes=20
it will destroy the timing belt as well - which could lead to very expensiv=
e=20
valve damage.  The water pump replacement is particularly unpleasant becaus=
e=20
it requires pulling the timing and balance belts to get to it.  You may wan=
t=20
to consider replacing the belts at the same time.  Changing the thermostat =
at=20
this time is also a good idea as it's very difficult to get to otherwise.  =
The=20
water pump has been updated several times.  The current New factory part=20
number is 951 106 021 10, the factory exchange water pump is 951 106 921 X =
=20
($100.00 core charge).  If you update to the latest pump, you will also nee=
d=20
the updated thermostat (p/n 944 234 160 00), otherwise you can use the old=
=20
style thermostat (p/n 944 106 129 05).  The rebuilt pumps may not be the=20
bargain they appear to be, and some mechanics will refuse to even install a=
=20
rebuilt pump because they've had so many fail.  (see the note in the power=
=20
train section for information on removing the thermostat.)

Oil cooler seal leak
The seals in the oil cooler will sometimes shrink due to age, changing oils=
,=20
etc.  In 1987, Porsche redesigned the seal causing many failures.  The=20
production was not corrected until 1991.  All models between 1987 and 1991 =
are=20
extremely at risk for this failure, if they haven't been updated to the lat=
est=20
part keep a very close eye on your coolant and oil.  When the seal fails, i=
t=20
allows oil to enter your cooling system, and coolant into your oil.  If you=
=20
check your oil and notice a chocolatey brown froth on your dip stick, or if=
=20
you notice brown residue in your coolant over-flow tank you should take it =
to=20
the shop immediately and have the seals replaced, the radiator and coolant=
=20
passages will need to be cleaned with a degreaser and the oil should be=20
changed immediately.  It's also highly recommended that the lower-end beari=
ngs=20
be replaced because of the accelerated wear caused by water in the oil.

Power Steering Fluid Reservoir Leaks
The clamps that hold the hoses onto the reservoir don't seem to do their jo=
b=20
very well.  Replacing or tightening the clamps tends to solve this problem.=
 =20
You may also need to replace the small flexible piece of hose (and clamps)=
=20
that allows the power steering fluid return hose to go around the engine bl=
ock=20
and underneath the oil filter.  The easiest way to check for a leak here is=
 to=20
raise the headlights so you can look down inside the nose of the car.  The=
=20
main reason for catching these problems early is that if power steering flu=
id=20
leaks down onto your suspension arms it may rot out your ball joints.  As o=
f=20
1985.5 they can't be replaced individually, and the entire arm ($$$) must b=
e=20
replaced. =20

Hood and hatch shocks worn out
Harmless, but inconvenient.  They can be replaced easily, they cost between=
=20
$12-20 depending on where you buy.

Hatch electronic release non-functional
The nylon piece that holds the cable sometimes breaks.  This component is=
=20
fairly easy to replace.  The carpet can also interfere with the rotating=20
shaft. If the hatch is not aligned properly the hatch catches will bind, no=
t=20
allowing the motor and associated cable to do it's job.

Power window motor mechanisms
If the channels become dirty or warped, the power window motors may become=
=20
damaged and eventually burn out.  If the motor sounds like it is straining,=
 or=20
makes grinding/lugging noises it will more than likely need to be replaced =
in=20
the near future.  Cleaning the channels and making sure the windows are=20
properly aligned will prevent damage.

Idle Stabilizer
Gets gunked up and causes rough idle. Some list members have disassembled t=
he=20
idle stabilizer and successfully cleaned them up.  On the 944 turbo and 944=
S=20
the intake manifold must be removed to access the stabilizer(this can be=20
expensive labor wise). An updated part is available which is supposed to=20
minimize the problem.  It's manufactured by Bosch and replacement cost is=
=20
approximately $175.00.

Fuel Injectors dirty
Porsche Cars North America (PCNA) recommends that you use a product contain=
ing=20
the Chevron Techron additive to keep injectors clean and fully functional. =
 If=20
you notice hard starting, rough idle, or weak acceleration you may want to =
try=20
running a bottle of this additive to your next fill up of gas.

Front wheel shimmy
A shimmy at around 70 mph on early 944's appears to be a very common proble=
m. =20
No one is sure why it exists, but it may have something to do with the fron=
t=20
suspension's VW rabbit origins.  A wheel-on-the-car balance job frequently=
=20
helps minimize the problem.

Cruise Control Problems
Symptoms such as: doesn't set speed, speed fluctuates, speed increases, etc=
..=20
are generally caused by a bad cruise controller.  The control box is above =
the=20
hood release catch inside the car.  It looks like a long thing rectangular=
=20
metal box.  Apparently one or more components can go bad inside, which lead=
s=20
to all kinds of intermittent problems.  This is not the only thing that can=
 go=20
wrong with the cruise control system, but is very common.  If possible, hav=
e=20
your mechanic or a friend with the same car swap boxes and see if it fixes=
=20
your problem.  (note: if anyone has information on repairing CC boxes, plea=
se=20
let me know so I can add it to the FAQ.)

Worn/leaky heater valves caused damage to clutch
The heater valve has been moved to a different location (above the oil filt=
er)=20
in later models.  The retrofit can be done by a novice mechanic.  New hoses=
=20
must be ordered.  The changeover occurred in approximately 1988/89.

Coolant tank expanding
Age and high temperature combine to make the coolant overflow tank swell an=
d=20
eventually fail.  Replacing it before it fails entirely would be a very goo=
d=20
idea.  They run around $120 new.

Turbo Coolant Pump
This pump is supposed to run for 30 seconds after the car is shut off,=20
circulating water through the turbocharger.  You can hear it running if it =
is=20
operating properly.  The pump is assembled in two sections, with age and he=
at=20
the motor shaft binds and stops working.  The hoses at the bottom of the pu=
mp=20
create stress and this can cause a misalignment of the motor shaft. =20
Readjusting the pump housing in the pump clamp may unbind the pump.  A=20
replacement unit runs about $175.00. (p/n 951 606 130 01)

Cracks in old style manifolds (non-accordion type)
Under warranty PCNA replaced the non-bellowed type headers when they cracke=
d,=20
with the improved accordion style. The factory changeover occurred sometime=
 in=20
1987.  If you have an 86 with cracked bellowed-type headers, a lot of=20
complaining may get them replaced under the "hidden" warranty even if it's=
=20
beyond the normal warranty mileage.  Otherwise, replacement would cost roug=
hly=20
$1200.00.

Center console cassette holder hinge broken
A very bad design and a very common failure.  The official Porsche componen=
t=20
is used to be very expensive.  Recently PCNA made available the hinge-only=
=20
part (944 552 553 01 01C) which is much cheaper (approximately $13).  Steel=
=20
after market replacements are also available.

Cracked or Broken Windshields
The 944 windshield is particularly expensive, the list price is over $2000!=

If you don't live in a major city with many glass places, you may want to m=

order the glass and have one of the local glass people install it:

Where is the %$#@!! odometer trip reset switch?

The instructions are in your owner's manual.  If you don't have an owner's=

direction slider.


How do I get the sunroof off?

The owner=92s manual isn=92t quite complete in it=92s description of how to=
 remove=20
the sunroof.  The proper sequence of events is:

Close the sunroof entirely.
Turn off car.
Turn the ignition key to the FIRST indent (IMPORTANT!).
Press the sunroof key, you should hear a noise from the sunroof.  Hold the=
=20
button down until it stops.  The roof is now unlatched.
Unhook the front manually, press up on the back and you should be able to=
=20
remove the roof.


My sunroof/windshield/other leaks and my car is full of water, what do I do=
?

There are several ways for rain to turn your car into a bathtub.  Some of t=
he=20
more popular ones are:

Sunroof
There are 4 drain holes located at each corner of the channel where the=20
sunroof sits on the roof.  If they get clogged with debris it allows water =
to=20
overflow into your car.  Removing the sunroof and dumping some water down e=
ach=20
hole is the best way to determine which one is causing the problem.  Don't =
use=20
compressed air to clean it out, it may cause the tube to detach entirely.

Drilling holes in the firewall to run wiring
Water runs down the firewall and into your nice little hole.  You may be ab=
le=20
to seal it up, but it will probably start leaking again with the movement o=
f=20
the wires and vibration.  Rerouting the wiring elsewhere and plugging the h=

will fix your leak for good.


What is the actual temperature indicated by the temperature gauge?

85.5 and previous:

Bottom of gauge: 40 degrees C
Start of rightmost block: 105 C
End of rightmost block: 120 C

85.5 to present:

Bottom of gauge (start of bottom mark): 40 C
End of bottom mark: 60 C
First slash mark: 80 C
second slash mark: 100 C
Start of top block: 115 C


I'd like to replace my hood badge, how do I get that thing off?

The hood badge has a couple of pins on the back that fit into some plastic=
=20
grommets.  You can use a gasket scraper or putty knife to CAREFULLY (very v=
ery=20
carefully, or your paint will be damaged) to pry off the old badge and simp=
ly=20
push on the new one.


My hand brake won't stay up/doesn't hold the car, what's broke?

If it doesn't stay up, something is probably frozen or broken inside the ha=
nd=20
brake assembly.  You can take it apart (much easier with the driver seat ou=
t)=20
and examine the components.  Most likely the ratchet release is frozen and =
can=20
be freed with some penetrating oil, or the spring is gone/broken.

If your hand brake doesn't work well and the cable linkage looks good you m=
ay=20
have worn out your brake shoes.  Yes, the parking brake has it's own little=
=20
brake shoes.  Typically they last a long time unless you drive around with =
the=20

=20
928.352.097.10).  You can find very good used ones, since they typically do=
n't=20
wear very much.


My hatch is making noises, anything I can do?

Not a lot.  As the ambient temperature drops, the evil things start to sque=
ak=20
even more.  First check and make sure the hinges aren't loose or losing the=
=20
hinge pins.  You can alleviate some of the noises by adjusting the posts th=
at=20
hang down from the hatch.  Hold the post and loosen the lock nut and then=
=20
screw the post in a bit.  Do both sides equally and try closing the hatch,=
=20
repeat until it doesn't close anymore and then back-off a turn.

If you're experiencing clunking, it's possible the hatch glass as separated=
=20
from the frame.  You can take it to a windshield shop and have them reglue =
the=20
glass, it's fairly expensive but cheaper than a whole new piece of glass.


My alloys aren't very pretty anymore, anything I can do?

After several years of brake dust, harsh car wash detergents, etc., the cle=
ar=20
coat on the alloy wheels will discolor.  The best method of returning them =

I need to pull my car onto a flatbed, what do I attach the toe rope to?

There is *nothing* good on the front of these cars to tow by.  Anything you=

Although several list members use it, it is not recommended by Porsche.  Th=

My car runs hot/temperature fluctuates, what are possible problems?

Check your temperature sender and gauge.

Make sure all the air is bled from the cooling system.  There are a few tri=
cks=20
in getting most of the air out when refilling.  The 16 valve heads are pron=
e=20
to trap more air than the simpler 8 valvers.  Kevin Gross' trick for gettin=
g=20
most of the air out when refilling involves leaving the bleeder valve open=
=20
while refilling, loading the system until the expansion tank is mostly full=
=20
and then forcing the coolant through until coolant comes out the bleeder va=
lve=20
(how do you force the coolant through?  Kevin performs mouth to mouth on th=
e=20
expansion tank, the rest of us can use a coolant system pressure tester - a=
=20
device which basically looks like a bicycle pump connected to a radiator ca=
p). =20
You may have to repeat the fill/pressurize cycle several times before coola=
nt=20
comes out of your bleeder valve.  For all bleeding, make sure you crank the=
=20
heater temperature control to the full open position or you'll be there=20
forever trying to get the air out.

Check hoses, pipes, and paths for blockage/leakage and verify water is gett=
ing=20
in the radiator.  If your car is over heating, but the radiator remains col=
d=20
it's possible either the radiator is blocked or the thermostat is stuck shu=
t. =20
The thermostat recirculates the water until the engine is hot, and then ope=
ns=20
up to let the water into the radiator.  If it's frozen shut you'll overheat=
=20
but still see the normal reading on the gauge.

Check fan (there are two) operation.  There are two relays that affect fan=
=20
operation.  One controls the one fan during normal operation and another th=
at=20
controls the other fan when the A/C is on.  Only one fan operates when the =
A/C=20
is off, turning on the A/C activates the other fan.  Neither fan is necessa=
ry=20
for highway cooling (in fact, they get in the way) so you may only notice o=
ver=20
heating in stop and go traffic.  The fan switch in the radiator can fail wi=
th=20
the fan off, or on.  If the fans won't run under normal conditions (sitting=
 in=20
traffic while your temperature climbs) the switch is probably stuck off.  I=
f=20
your fans continue to run long after you turn off the car, draining your=20
battery, the switch is probably stuck in the on position.

Check coolant level.
Ensure that air flow to and through the radiator is not blocked.
Make sure your water/antifreeze ratio is greater than 2:1.


I can=92t remove that %$#@!! thermostat snap ring!  What tool do I use?

Removing the 944 thermostat snap ring is extremely difficult due to it=92s=
=20
location and configuration.  Ron Olsen has suggested a particular tool: =20
SnapOn PR5645A Snap Ring Pliers (45 degree with .09=94 tips).  It runs=20
approximately $20.


I'm losing coolant, what's going on?

The coolant system is closed.  If you're losing coolant it's very likely=20
something bad.  Pressurizing the cooling system may help you find the leak.=
 =20
Common leakages are the hose connections, water pump, oil cooler, or even t=
he=20
radiator splitting apart (they're part aluminum and part plastic, the seam=
=20
sometimes fails).  If you do find a leak, your best bet is to fix the probl=
em. =20
Avoid using stop-leak products if at all possible since they may cause more=

problems than they fix such as clogging passageways and causing blowouts.


Where should my oil pressure be at when cold? warm? idling?

When your car is cold, the oil is thicker.  Normally this means when you fi=
rst=20
start your car the oil pressure will be 5 bar at idle.  After warming up th=
e=20
car (typically, it takes approximately twice as long for the oil to reach=
=20
operating range as your coolant does) it should drop to between 2 and 3 bar=
 at=20
idle.  You don't need to worry unless it drops to or below 1 bar.  If the o=
il=20
pressure sender fails, typically the oil pressure will peg at 5 bar as soon=
 as=20
you turn the key to the on position.


I=92m worried about my car starving for oil during hard cornering, is there=
 a=20
fix?

For highly modified vehicles pulling very high cornering G=92s, it is
possible that the oil will slosh away from the pickup causing the
engine to starve for oil (read: big engine damage).  The 89 944
Turbo and S2 have an additional pan baffle to help avoid this problem.
This part will fit other 944=92s.  The Oil Pan Baffle part number is:
944.107.389.03 and runs approximately $65.97.  This may not fix
the problem entirely, but it may help.


When I release my clutch in neutral, I hear noises, is this bad?

Not usually.  The transmission has several shafts that the gears move back =
and=20
forth on.  On the end of one of these shafts is the 5th gear idler.  This g=
ear=20
rattles back and forth because it has a larger tolerance than the others. =
=20
Porsche apparently stopped all warranty repairs for this noise because ther=
e=20
is no real repair - the larger tolerance is normal.  The noise is particula=
rly=20
evident because it vibrates the input shaft which is connected to the torqu=
e=20
tube that runs up the middle of your car.  This creates an megaphone type=
=20
effect that amplifies the noise.  If you're unsure if your particularly=20
"noise" is normal or not, taking it to a mechanic who has looked at a few=
=20
944's should clear the situation up for you.  Some owners have expressed th=
at=20
using Swepco transmission oil quiets down the rattle somewhat. =20


I'm replacing my clutch, any helpful hints?

Bleeding the clutch circuit can be quite an adventure.  Using a positive=20
pressure bleeding apparatus like the Gunson E-Z Bleed kit ($35 and uses=20
compressed air from a tire) helps a lot.  Another useful hint is to jack th=
e=20
back end of the car higher than the front while bleeding, this helps trappe=

What's all this about the infamous belt tensioning tool P9201?

Because of the catastrophic nature of timing belt failure (valves being=20
destroyed), there is very little room for error when tensioning the timing=
=20
belts.  The P9201 tool costs approximately $400, and it appears there is no=
=20
alternative tool (the search for such a beast has become the holy grail of=
=20
water cooler do-it-yourselfers everywhere).  The 1987 and later cars have a=
=20
built in tensioner for the timing belt.  However, it is still recommended t=
hat=20
the tool be used on the alternator and A/C belts.  Some philes use the "by=
=20
hand" tensioning method, this requires a good "feel" for how tight the belt=
s=20
should be but it's your engine and your decision.


Do I need a special engine stand to hold a 944 motor?

Nope.  A "normal" four-finger engine stand works fine.  Be careful that the=
=20
bolts don't go too far into the block or they may damage the mounting point=
s=20
for the bell housing.


I'm replacing my timing belt, any helpful thoughts?

It's a good idea to get a feel for how the engine turns before changing the=
=20
belts.  Going one full rotation at the crank pulley will give you a good id=
ea=20
of how the engine should "feel".  When you've completed the job you will be=
=20
able to tell if the car is out of time because the resistance will be too=
=20
high.  If you don't know how it should feel, you may end up damaging your=
=20
valves with your breaker bar.

For final tensioning, the engine should be at TDC minus 10 degrees, to find=
=20
TDC remove the distributor cap and cam sprocket housing while leaving the=
=20
wires in place (this is a good time to replace your cap and rotor).  You no=
w=20
have a clear view of the timing belt on the cam sprocket enroute to the=20
tensioner and can begin looking for TDC (top dead center).  Using a breaker=
=20
bar half inch drive with a 24mm socket and a mixed bag of adaptors/extensio=
ns,=20
turn the engine over at the crank pulley nut until you align the nick in th=
e=20
cam sprocket with the nick in the cam housing.  Because the cam turns at a =
2/1=20
ratio with the crank, you must check the flywheel for the stamped "OT".  At=
=20
the rear of the engine from the drivers side just before the firewall, you =
can=20
peek down and see at least one opening atop the clutch bell housing.  Insid=
e=20
is the flywheel which you will see moving if you turn the engine with your=
=20
left hand.  Atop and through that hole will be the letters "OT" when TDC is=
=20
reached.  It will be one of the two times the cam marks align.  There is al=
so=20
a mark at the bottom of the flywheel under the car, that will point straigh=
t=20
down when TDC is reached.  From TDC, turn the crank anticlockwise 1-1.5 cam=
=20
teeth.

In order to replace the timing belt on the '87 or later cars, you need to=
=20
remove the self-tensioner assembly which is held in place by 3 bolts you ca=
n't=20
see.  The 3 you can see, you don't remove.  The bolts you need to remove=20
roughly form a triangle around and behind the three bolts you can see (whic=
h=20
are for the tensioning sprocket, the one the assembly pivots on, and the on=
e=20
that freezes it in place).


How do I tension the timing belt an 87 or later car using the built-in=20
tensioner?

The self-tensioner on '87 and later 944, S, Turbo and S2 allows accurate=20
tensioning of the timing belt without tool P9201.  The assembly achieves th=
is=20
by means of a spring whose preload is fixed to create the proper tension wh=
ile=20
the engine is cold.  Loosening the correct bolts frees the spring up to do=
=20
this task before retightening.

The entire job is done from above the engine.  You gain access to the belts=
 by=20
removing various things depending on which 944 variant you have.  The 944, =
S,=20
Turbo and S2 are all a little different.  In each case you are removing hos=
es=20
or boxes which carry air.  The 944 has a coolant hose which may get in the=
=20
way.  The Turbo needs to have some of it's plumbing removed.

Once you have a clear view of the top portion of the two piece plastic belt=
=20
housing, remove the 10mm bolts holding it in place and finagle it out.  You=
=20
now have a view of the tensioner assembly and belts.  The belt should look=
=20
fresh and not show cracking or shining.

The next phase would, by some, be considered optional.

The factory workshop manual states that the engine should be at TDC (top de=
ad=20
center) minus 10 degrees (about 1-1.5 cam teeth) before the tensioning spri=
ng=20
is released.  This is because belt tension isn't always the same between th=
e=20
cam and crank as the engine turns.  It varies slightly.  If being unable to=
=20
find TDC discourages you, you might still be better off releasing the sprin=
g=20
than chancing a loose belt.  A description locating TDC is available above =
in=20
the Timing belt replacement tips.

The tensioner is the alloy arm roughly 6 inches long with three bolts stick=
ing=20
out.  If you look behind it, you'll see the spring.  The assembly swings on=
=20
the top bolt, has an elliptical opening on the locking bottom right bolt an=
d=20
retains the tensioning sprocket with the bolt on the left.

Loosen the top 13mm bolt.  Now, while watching the tensioning sprocket for=
=20
movement, loosen the locking 13mm nut.  The sprocket should either not move=
 or=20
move slightly to the left and up against the timing belt.  If no movement=
=20
occurs, take a 17mm closed end wrench slip it on the sprocket bolt and put=
=20
pressure down on the nut to make sure it is not seized/jammed.  Lock the=20
locking nut to the designated torque (warning: its not much).  Install=20
everything back at the proper torque and you are all set.


I have fungus/scum growing in my washer fluid reservoir/lines, how do I get=
=20
rid of it?

Some suggestions from the list were:
Remove and flush the washer reservoir once every year or two.  Perhaps add =

There are also several commercial anti-freeze windshield washer solutions=

methanol/alcohol/who knows what.  They sound nasty and will probably kill=

Another 'philer suggests that isopropanol and water would be the best/clean=
est=20
windshield cleaner.  Isopropanol is significantly more expensive than metha=
nol=20
which is probably why it's not used in the commercial anti-freeze/deicers.
Other possibilities include a vinegar/water solution, or some of the chemic=
al=20
products used for killing algae and bacteria in drinking water (RV and boat=

water tanks).

Things you probably don't want to run through your pump and washer system:
Diesel Fuel anti-bacterial/algae.  It's greasy and nasty and would probably=

wreak havoc in your system.
Bleach.  Cleaning out the bottle with it would be OK, but running it throug=

could cause nastiness to your pump system and your car's exterior.
Simple Green.  Some people use this with good success.  However, several=20
sources (including Simple Green) agree that having it settle on your paint=

would probably be bad for both your wax and even some finishes (dulling the=

I lost my wheel lock keys, what's the easiest way to get the lock off?

Either you can pay a locksmith a few bucks to pick the lock, or you can tak=

right off and you can remove the fastener like any other lug nut.


What=92s the deal with replacement ball joints/suspension arms and what cau=
ses=20
their failure?

Yes, ball joints are known to fail.  However, it appears to occur mostly on=
=20
lowered track driven cars.  Larger swaybars may also contribute.  When the=
=20
ride height is lowered a great deal, the ball joint begins to reach the end=
 of=20
it=92s travel.  Eventually the ball joint can crack, and then fail entirely=
 -=20
possibly while you are driving very very fast.

Assuming you=92re not doing any of the above (extreme lowering, larger sway=
bars,=20
track usage) you may want to go with a reconditioned/rebuilt arm if your ba=
ll=20
joint fails.  Several vendors do this, including the pfiles recommended:

Poor AM radio reception is typically caused by the pre-amp not receiving=20

Performance Modifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Chips/Chipping

If your car is new, Porsche's official response is that using one will void=
=20
your warranty.  The 968(and 993) Bosch management system will lower the rev=
=20
limit if it detects a non-factory chip installed.

The factory tends to underspec their car's power slightly. Plus, chip vendo=
rs=20
are usually highly optimistic on their claims of power increase.  Take thei=
r=20
fancy chart-o-graphic specification sheets with a grain of salt.

It's possible the chip is not smog legal in your area. It may also cause=20
problems with the new "rolling" smog test (where the drive wheels are actua=
lly=20
driven through the RPM range to give a more accurate picture of your vehicl=
e's=20
emissions).

And remember:  There is no free lunch.  The factory did what it did for a=
=20
reason, if there were an extra 20 hp that could be gained without any loss =
in=20
flexibility, reliability or safety they would have used it.

Things a chip can do:

Increase throttle response by modifying the throttle profile (Turbo, 944S, =
S2,=20
968)

This similar to adding a round throttle cam to a regular 944.  The normal=
=20
throttle cam and throttle profile are flatter when you first begin to=20
accelerate.  This helps prevent lunging and makes your driving smoother.  A=
=20
modified throttle profile makes the response quicker - less pedal movement=
=20
equals more gas.  No actual HP results from this, but it feels racier.

Increase Boost (Turbo)
Yes, increasing boost gives you more power.  Possible damage could result, =
see=20
below under "Performance Gains".

Increase Rev Limit
This probably won't give you more power. It can come in handy when auto-
crossing.  It may allow you to take a turn without up shifting where you=20
normally would due to the rev limiter.  On cars where peak-torque is very=
=20
high, it may also help your straight acceleration times if your power doesn=
't=20
roll off too steeply after a certain RPM.  Normally the rev limit increase =
by=20
these chips is fairly small (for example, 500 RPM), so damage to your engin=
e=20
is unlikely if you use the extra revs rarely.

Increase spark advance and/or lean out the mixture to use 92 octane gas

This sounds like the holy grail.  Free HP, and all you have to do is use=20
better gas!  Well, yes.  This is where the chip-maker's claims usually stem=
=20
from (as you can see, in non-turbo cars, the other items aren't going to gi=
ve=20
you more actual power).  However, most of the high compression cars already=
=20
require 92 octane gas.  In older, lower compression cars, you're more likel=
y=20
to see some improvement.

Performance gains:

Normally Aspirated Cars=20
Zero to minimal.  Some chips will trade low end torque for some loss at hig=
h=20
end (minimal, in the 5 hp and below range).  Damage is unlikely to result t=
o=20
your car, but the engine could be damaged if the programmers were clueless=
=20
like running the engine too lean which would lead to detonation (knocking,=
=20
pinging) and the subsequent engine destruction.  You may also notice a=20
slightly different engine note because of the advanced timing.

Turbo
Yes, more boost =3D more HP.

With that being said, all the chips increase boost by controlling the waste=
=20
gate.  The factory also tends to roll off boost above ~4500 RPM to lessen t=
he=20
strain on the engine.  The after market chips usually increase both the ove=
r-
all boost and not roll it off as much at high RPM.

However, the head gasket is not a strong point of the 951 engine.  The fact=
ory=20
has revised the part several times, changed the torque values for the bolts=
,=20
etc.  Almost all the chips claim to have special mappings for the engine=20
control module that allegedly minimize the chance of gasket failure.  Some =
may=20
be better at this than others.  But don't fool yourself: running more boost=
=20
puts more load on your head gasket, the engine, and the rest of the car.

There are several after market suppliers that carry copper, stainless steel=
=20
and other "exotic" head gaskets.  Replacing your head gasket and upgrading =
the=20
bolts to something like Raceware fasteners may allow you to run more boost=
=20
without losing a head gasket - for a while.  How long your rods and bearing=
s=20
will last is questionable

Kevin Gross has this wise advice (paraphrased):
"If you overboost the engine, or run the timing wrong or any of a number of=
=20
sins, something's going to break.  Head gaskets are cheap and easy to repla=
ce. =20
Holed pistons, burnt valves, etc., etc., are expensive and difficult to=20
replace.  Think twice before compromising your 'safety valve' head gasket."

15 psi or 1.1 bar of boost appears to be the maximum amount of boost you ca=
n=20
run with a reasonable margin of safety.  Going beyond this (such as the=20
injectors maximum of 17 psi) would require extensive modification such as=
=20
replacing the fuel pump, seals, transmission to handle the extra power, etc=
..,=20
etc.

If you must have a chip:
See if you can find a used one.  Damage for the normally aspirated cars is=
=20
unlikely to result, so you might as well pick up a chip cheap.
If you buy one new, make sure you buy from a vendor that lets you return it=
=20
"no questions asked".  If the chip doesn't live up to your expectations, yo=
u=20
can return it.


Engine & Transmission

Using a 944S ring & pinion in a 944 Turbo transmission.

The answer is:  DON=92T.

There have been many reports of 944 Turbo transmissions self destructing=20
because of this modification.  Basically, the 944S ring & pinion just can=

Brakes

My front brakes seem to be doing most of the work and wearing out twice as=
=20
fast as my rears, can I adjust the front/rear proportions?=09

The original proportioning valve on the 944 Turbo was of the 5/18 variety. =
=20
The number 5 is the rate of the reduction in pressure to the rear brakes.  =
The=20
18 refers to the pressure in bar where the valve starts to modulate the rea=
r=20
brake pressure.  What this means that once your rear brake pressure reaches=
 18=20
bar, the valve reduces the amount of braking to the rear.  The updated part=

(5/33) first showed up on the 944S.  In switching to the 5/33 valve, you=20
should be aware it may cause rear brake lock up leading to nasty spinouts. =
 If=20
your car has ABS it would seem to be a worthwhile and safe change, especial=
ly=20
for track usage.  However, some people have expressed the fear that locking=
 up=20
all four tires at once would cause the ABS system to think the vehicle is=

stopped.  The p/n for the 5/33 valve is 928.355.305.02 and lists at around=
=20
$69.05.
