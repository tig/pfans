>Do you have the part number for this rubber spacer?

Unfortunately this is a casting number, not a part number.  Does your *new*
water pump have the two bosses and the guard rail (chromed metal) between
the w/p pulley and the roller?  If so, it's p/n 951.106.021.10, the late
style w/p.

>So is the sequence: 1. Snap ring, 2. Metal shim, 3. Rubber spacer,
>4. Thermostat ?

I'm a little fuzzy here -- I did my w/p a few years ago and the details are
a little dulled with time!  I think the rubber seal goes on and around the
lip of the thermostat.  The new one is thicker.  The metal shim is altogether
new and goes between the thermostat/seal and the circlip.

So the installation order is 1. seal onto thermostat, 2. thermostat in w/p
bore, 3. metal shim, 4. circlip.

The tech bulletin notes that up to 0.6 mm axial play is normal when all is
installed.  That's a lot of play, but they say it's OK.

You should also note the orientation of the thermostat.  It should have an
arrow on it, which should point up when installed.  Some thermostats have
a visible bleeder in their face, eg, Mercedes parts.  I don't think the
Porsche (Wahle) part does, but the function is there somewhere and the arrow
denotes the right installed orientation.

Hope this helps, Ken.
