Gregor Diseth asks

>While the dashboard cracking thread is alive, List wisdom on the following:

>My '89 944 2.7 has developed three small cracks, one in each defroster
slot.  They are about 1/4 inch or several millimeters long.  I bought the
car second hand about 9 months ago, so I have no idea how the first owner
protected the dash.

>I am now using one of those foil backed sunshields in the winshield when
I park.  Will this alone stop the disease?  I thought of filling the
existing cracks with two part epoxy, is this recommended?  It seems the
sun and/or heat is drying the vinyl's natural lubricants, causing
brittlness.  I am currently looking for a non-silicone based protectant
(not Armor-All) to use on the dash.  It looks rather flat and dry, but
then again, I don't wan't that sickeningly shiny used car look, either.

The cracking will probably continue. 

The good news is that it is possible to fix it but in similar situations on
other cars, I have not had any luck with the aftermarket products available;
results just look amateurish. I would recommend that you find a local guy who
repairs and re-dyes vinyl and leather for the used car dealers. They can do
incredible things with their truckfull of tricks. One guy I talked to said "I
can guarantee that the dash will never crack in THAT spot again." Talk to a
dealer who sells higher-end used cars (Mercedes, Porsche, BMW). These guys
usually work out of their pickup trucks. 

To get at the cracks, it might be advisable to remove and reinstall the
windshield. Another job for another specialist working out of his pickup
truck.

Let us know what you find out.
