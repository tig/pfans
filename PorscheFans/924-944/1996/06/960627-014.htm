Chris: 
  
I disagree with 2 items in your post.  First, I have seen a Turbo S sell here 
in Cal. for 12,500.  Nice car, 76K miles.  I have seen 89 Turbos in the 10-13K 
range.   
 
Second, I don't think the 88TurboS is going to be a particularly collectible 
car.  It was a bit weird with it's magenta metallic paint and plaid insert 
interior but the S designation only identified the color combo and not a 
particularly desirable one.  All of the Turbos, 88and89 produced after the S 
was introduced had normal colors and the same mechanical improvements.  These, 
I believe are the most desirable.  I believe they will continue to be the most 
desirable because of their relative performance/dollar.  Go to a PCA Club Race 
and you'll see all these Turbos coming out now.  You'll also notice that the 
guys with the 86, 87and 88s are spending big bucks to spec their cars up to 89 
spec or beyond.  I believe it's cheaper and easier in the long run to hold out 
for  and spend a few more bucks for the 89.  I drove several 87s and two 89s 
before buying my 89 and the differences were real obvious.  The 88-89 felt 
like a different car, faster, handled much better and was more sophisticated.  
This was a 50K car new and performance was in the 'Supercar' range.  Now you 
can buy it readily for 14-15K with reasonable mileage. 
 
Keep looking and be patient.........it's worth the wait.  Contrary to popular 
belief, your money will not burn a hole in your pocket.... 
 
Ted

The first year the turbo S appeared in the U.S was 1988.  List price new
was nearly $50k.  I generally agree with the above comments, but it should
be noted that the "regular" 217bhp turbo is hardly a slouch of a car.
Unless you plan on campaigning the turbo S in competition, I don't believe
the extras are worth the additional cost (as in most cases they will not be
realized by the daily driver).  The S is the most likely in the 944 range
to appreciate as a collector car in the next ten years, so a high mileage
car with track experience/modifications would not be at the top of the
heap.  I never liked the design of the airbagged steering wheel
(particularly where it joins with the steering column), nor the funky
cloth+plaid interior.

The turbo S has a higher top-end due to a bigger turbo.  It has also been
alleged that it suffers in around-town driveability because of this (due to
the increase in lag).  Many S owners opt for shorter gear ratios to make
their cars more aggressive in around-town situations.  The suspension is
much, much harder than the non-S.  Remember, these modifications were
designed originally for track use.  The '86 and '87 turbo are also
extremely reliable, well-engineered cars which can easily be made to match
the performance of the S on the street.  One caveat: S wheels will not fit
on a standard turbo, though the two cars will be able to wear the same-size
tire.

Frankly, I have not seen an '88 turbo S for less than $20k on the used
market.  The standard turbo, at about roughly $10k-$13k, is a bargain by
comparison.

Simply said, I will agree that the S is in many ways the superior car, but
one should certainly not discount a clean, well-maintained standard
turbo--especially if you like to perform your own modifications.  You will
not be disappointed, either way.
