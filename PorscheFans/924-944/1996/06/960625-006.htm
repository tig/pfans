Why, the oil level sensor of course!  It was slip-streamed into 944 production
during 1987.  In fact, there was a tech bulletin warning dealers that they
will see cars with various incomplete bits of the circuit, that that
was normal, and that PCNA did not consider finishing the implementation to
be a warranty matter!

The sensor is installed into the right-hand side of the oil pan.  It has
a triangular mounting plate with three M5 bolts, and a large yellow wire
to its single connector.
