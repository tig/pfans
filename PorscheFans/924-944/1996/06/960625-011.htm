Hi Barry, 
 
I'm wrestling with a decision and need some input.  I was hoping you might 
have some info and opinion and I'll post this to the list too.  As you know, 
I'm running my 83 944 Trackmobile in TTrials and Club Racing.  I've been 
pretty successful with it and have won every TTrial so far and one of the two 
Club Races I've been in.  I've  also got an 89 944 Turbo that I bought with 
the intention of making it next years Club Racer.  Seeing many more Turbos 
showing up this year at TTrials and Races.  More than the non turbos.  Here's 
my dilemma.....I don't want to change cars unless I can move up at least 5 
sec. faster.  The turbo is stock now so I've been watching others run that are 
closer to Club Race specs and checking their lap times.  I just finished a TT 
at Thunderhill this weekend.  Won my class with a 1:28.2.  Next fastest non 
turbo was 1:34.7 or something like that.  There's a 924S that's in another 
class that's at 1:30.9 and he's been the closest competition.  Anyway, the 
dilemma is that there was only one Turbo, S I think, that was running faster 
than me and he was in at 1:26.7 so we're talking 1.5 sec.  Out of the 5 tracks 
we run on locally, Sears, Laguna and THill are fairly tight and technical.  
ButtonWillow and WillowSprings are faster so I would expect the turbos to 
stretch out the time a bit.  Trend, however, based on my last three events is 
that the turbos aren't going much faster than my normal.   
 
So, one question: is the differential timewise between turbos/non turbos 
greater in other parts of the country?  I'm talking about Club Racing Stock 
Classes, not highly modified stroker turbos.  Any 944 racers have 
insights/opinions here?  I really don't want to move up unless I'm up at least 
5 sec.  It's looking like there will be more competition in the turbo ranks as 
more turbos are coming out than normals so that's a + for the move.  Any 
opinions there? 
 
Thanks, 
 
Ted

OK, I'll start.

My friend's 944 turbo is in the shop. He needs a clutch, and some other 
assorted stuff. His friend, who has an 86 911, was giving him sh*t
because the repair is going to cost $3000, and the car, which he
bought back in March, cost another $11,500. So, the 911 guy says
"Boy, between the 11.5 for the car, and the 3K for the repair, you
could have bought a nice 911." So my friend, very calmy and matter
of factly says, "Yeah, but then I'd be slow."

Barry
