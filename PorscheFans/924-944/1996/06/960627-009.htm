The first year the turbo S appeared in the U.S was 1988.  List price new
was nearly $50k.  I generally agree with the above comments, but it should
be noted that the "regular" 217bhp turbo is hardly a slouch of a car.
Unless you plan on campaigning the turbo S in competition, I don't believe
the extras are worth the additional cost (as in most cases they will not be
realized by the daily driver).  The S is the most likely in the 944 range
to appreciate as a collector car in the next ten years, so a high mileage
car with track experience/modifications would not be at the top of the
heap.  I never liked the design of the airbagged steering wheel
(particularly where it joins with the steering column), nor the funky
cloth+plaid interior.

The turbo S has a higher top-end due to a bigger turbo.  It has also been
alleged that it suffers in around-town driveability because of this (due to
the increase in lag).  Many S owners opt for shorter gear ratios to make
their cars more aggressive in around-town situations.  The suspension is
much, much harder than the non-S.  Remember, these modifications were
designed originally for track use.  The '86 and '87 turbo are also
extremely reliable, well-engineered cars which can easily be made to match
the performance of the S on the street.  One caveat: S wheels will not fit
on a standard turbo, though the two cars will be able to wear the same-size
tire.

Frankly, I have not seen an '88 turbo S for less than $20k on the used
market.  The standard turbo, at about roughly $10k-$13k, is a bargain by
comparison.

Simply said, I will agree that the S is in many ways the superior car, but
one should certainly not discount a clean, well-maintained standard
turbo--especially if you like to perform your own modifications.  You will
not be disappointed, either way.
