If you park your car in the sun day after day, month after month, pretty
soon the dash is going to crack--it's just good old ultraviolet radiation.
I would not put anything on my 944 dash.  Armor all is just about the worst
thing you could put on it since it looks cheesy--like something a used-car
dealer would employ; attracts dust like a magnet, and requires you to keep
re-applying it periodically to "condition" the rubber/vinyl or it will
crack if neglected.  Besides, if you do the dash, you'll want to do the
door panels, the center console--it will never end!

The best long-term investment a custom-fit dash cover.  Next to that, a
mylar or reflective sunshade, which will protect not only the dash, but the
seats as well (from the front, at least).
