  I just called Porsche AG and the following information was provided
concerning child car seats. I told them I had a 1986 911 coupe(the seat will
work with other year 911's as well according to the technician, HOWEVER, these
will not work well with cabs, evidently cabs are structured different and are a
pain in the ass) and that my daughter weighs 14 kg. The seats are sold in parts
depending on the WEIGHT of the child, not age. There are 4 parts to this setup
depending on the weight of your child. Basically there are 3 parts UNLESS your
child weighs less than 17 kg, in which case you NEED the 4th part which acts as
a "stabiliser" for the lighter weight child. The part #'s are as follows:
000 043 202 42
000 802 021 006WC
000 802 031 006WC
This is the stabiliser part # 000 802 041 006WC.

They had 2 colors, gray and colored (different colors all over), cost is ~300
DM (~$201.00) for the 3 piece set, and an additional ~33 DM (~$22.00) for the
stabiliser piece.

These seats will ALSO work in 944's according to the tech.

These seats go in the BACK seat of the car.

Since I own a 91 951 and not a 911 please no flames as to the pain in tha ass
remark concernig cabs!! That was the techs description.
