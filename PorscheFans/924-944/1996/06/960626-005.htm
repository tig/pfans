I have had an '87 944T since it was new. It now has 95,000 miles on it and I
use it as a daily driver and for drivers ed and autocrosses. It is still a
nice car to drive to work, and is basically reliable. There are many things
that typically go wrong with 944's and the same list applies to 944 turbos.
You indicated that you had previously gotten a list of the common problems,
so I won't repeat them. I have had all of the normal problems with my car,
but I have never had any engine problems. It has had stage 2 chips (early
model, from Automotion) since about 1989 and the car runs strong. I
understand that the turbos can expect head gasket problems and, if they are
run for a long time at high rpms (over 6000), failure of the #2 rod
bearings. My mechanic strongly recommends Mobil 1 for turbos that are track
driven because of the bearing problems.

If I was in the market for a 944 Turbo, I would look for an '89. I have
friends that have had both an '86 and an '89 and they believe the '89 is by
far the better car. The '87 you are looking at sounds overpriced, even for
low miles. I have seen ads for '89s in the 16k to 18k range, and that sounds
like a better deal to me. Remember, the '89s came with limited slip,
adjustable Koni's, antilock brakes and more power. A chipped '89 is one of
the fastest cars on the track (Sebring) for drivers ed and it costs a lot of
$$$ to make an '87 the equivalent of an '89.

Good luck.

Mike
