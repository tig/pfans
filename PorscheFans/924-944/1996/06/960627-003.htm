Hi Donald,

I have an '89 car and would certainly recommend this in preference to the 220hp
variant. I am not sure during which year the 250hp version was announced in the
USA, but in the UK it was late 87/early 88 as the Turbo SE (Silver Rose
edition). The 1989 model was denoted the 944 Turbo and was available in regular
colors.

My car has now done 116,000 miles, I bought the car with 99,000 miles recorded.
I have replaced all the brake disks and rear wheel bearings and the cam &
balance shaft belts. Other than these items, the car just requires regular
servicing and Mobil 1 oil.

As I have done 17,000 miles in  8 months and use the car in all types of driving
situation (other than track), I think this is an indication that the Turbo
(250hp) is basically very reliable and the engine very durable. The car is very
fast, uses regular fuel (95 RON in UK) and does in excess of 160mph.
Acceleration is the major benefit, when the RPM hits 4000rpm in 2nd or 3rd, the
tyres are really fighting for grip. The car also has perfect 50/50 weight
distribution and hence handles very predictably.

I have driven 993's on the track at Silverstone (4wd) and feel the 951 would be
very able to maintain pace with a stock 265hp 993 under track conditions. The
brakes are very powerful and I still use DOT4 fluid. It is a very capable car
for the money

The '89 951 also has decent Aircon, Excellent ABS and electric everything so it
is a very easy car to live with all year round. If you get an '89 model it
should also come with the lighter mag alloy wheels. Later ones in UK had S2 type
alloy.

In summary, I would certainly recommend an '89 951, so hold out for one - its
well worth it.

Regards,
Andrew Sweetenham
