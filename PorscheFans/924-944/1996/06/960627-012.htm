Actually, the '87's had different offset wheels to accomodate larger brak=
es than the '86s. Also, '87 was the first year for dual standard airbags =
(actually a first in the US auto market). Sooo....you cannot put '86 whee=
ls on an '87 or vice versa. Also, I believe that the S versions came from=
 the factory with the rear inner wheel well lips rolled under, to create =
a bit more clearance for wider tires. This can be done to the earlier car=
s, although I haven't tried it with mine.

I, too, have owned my '87 since new. Tracked it, put 50,000 miles on it, =
and still love it. Yes, I would probably have preferred a 250 HP version =
had they been available then, but it still a remarkable car. I would also=
 comment that without getting on a track, you will never (well, hardly ev=
er) be able to sample the full potential of even the non-S turbo on the s=
treet.

Now, having said all of the above, I would probably not opt for a turbo f=
or the street. An S2 I drove some time ago was _much_ more fun in traffic=
 than the bottom-end-less turbo. Although out on the open road, or at Wat=
kins Glen, the turbo is a hoot!

Best wishes for a happy decision!
