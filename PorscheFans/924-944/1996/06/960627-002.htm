Chris,

Not as much cracking, but I have seen a number of 85.5+ dashes with the vent 
holes for the defrost nice and damaged from the sun/heat/uv

>my '84 944 has a heavily cracked dash, I'd like my '89 to

>than the older 944s?

Do NOT use a product that includes silicon (armor all has it).  The silicon 
actually makes things worse (back in the Pfiles days, there were TONS of 
discussions regarding the chemical makeup of vinyl and the rubber compound in 
tires and how silicon is actually destructive).  There are fine products from 
Zymol, McGuires and similar high end suppliers.

Personally, if it has ANYTHING to do with a cars finish, I call Larry Reynolds 
of Car Care Products (usual stuff, no affiliation, just a very satisfied 
customer).  He is one of the true "gurus" (sp??) in this field.  (201) 796-8300.

I would also invest in a sun shield (Here in CT, Cosco is selling them for 
under $3 for the same one Brookstones has for over $20).
