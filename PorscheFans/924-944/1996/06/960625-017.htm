Okay, got my estimate. Here it is in detail:


Desc.				Hours	Labor	Parts	Misc	Total
Replace Front Struts(complete)	3.0     $168	$394.82	$6.72	$569.54
   Part #
   94434303117 Shock(F)(LT)Strut 87-  $197.41
   94434303217 Shock(F)(RT)Strut 87-  $197.41 

Replace Front Shock Buffers & Boots w/Shocks	$52.60		$52.60
   Part #
   95134352700 Shock Buffer 944S,944 87 $15.60 x 2 = $31.20
   431412135   Shock Boot 944,944S 	$10.70 X 2 = $21.40


Desc.				Hours	Labor	Parts	Misc.	Total
Replace Rear Shocks		.80	$44.80	$193.90	$1.79	$240.49
   Part #
   95133303205 Shock(R) 851/2-88 96.95 x 2 = $193.90

Alignment (Front Only)-4-Wheel 
Compensated Alignment		1.80	$100.80		$4.03	$104.83


								Grand Total
								$1021.40

Found out today that the shocks included are not Bilsteins. They are
Sachs. How does this estimate sound to everyone else? I asked about upgrading
to the M474 option discussed earlier. The prices quoted to me were $214 
each for the Koni "Yellow" Sport Adjustables for the fronts (in place of 
the $197 Sachs) and $152 each (in place of the $96 Sachs) for the rears. 
This raises the estimate by about $150. I didn't think to ask how much 
extra for the Koni shock boots and buffers but it'll most likely be small 
change compared to the rest. They also said this is the worst case scenario 
for the M474 upgrade i.e. when they call around, they'll be able to find 
the Koni stuff cheaper. I am definitely leaning towards the M474 upgrade. It's
not much more than the stock stuff and I'm easy to sell on this kind of 
thing. Overall, how do these prices sound? Thanks...
