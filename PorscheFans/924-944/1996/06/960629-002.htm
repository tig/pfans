Hi Tim

>Cool! Thank you very much for your response!  I really appreciate it! That is a
pretty 
>informative article, but what else would one expect from Bruce Anderson.  So,
since 
>you have had the car for 116,000 miles, what have your maintenance costs come
out to 
>be? Pretty expensive, or has the 944 been cost effective?

I acquired the one owner car with 99,000 recorded and have since done another
17,000 miles. The car was serviced regularly by the previous owner and received
very little treatment other than that during its first 6 years. Since I have
owned the car, I have had to replace both front disks, both rear disks, both
rear bearings (one was noisy) and the cam & balance shaft belts and oil seals.
Also had to replace the cam cover gasket and cam pulley wheel. I also had fitted
a genuine Porsche immobilser and had two new movement sensors fitted to the
alarm. All this has cost in the region of L2,500 (UK Sterling). This doesn't
include the cost of servicing which is (in the UK) L223.00 + VAT for the 12,000
and just the cost of oil and filter for the 6,000 miler. I always use Mobil 1
engine oil. Rear tyres don't last too long. I got a set with the car and they
now require replacement.

I think the '89 944 Turbo has more than acceptable running costs. I also get
excellent fuel economy ranging from 22mpg to 30mpg. I regularly drive the car
hard and as a result like to keep an eye on its roadworthiness and performance
capability. If I take into consideration insurance, road tax, fuel and servicing
& repair costs, my vehicle has a per mile running cost of: L0.35 (UK Sterling).
Now bear in mind that fuel in the UK is L0.55 per litre - about L2.20 per US
Gallon, i.e. $3.38 per gallon!! that is very reasonable. The car will not
depreciate (from the original purchase price), if anything its value should
increase on what I originally bought it for. What other car can combine these
running costs with 250hp, 257 lb ft Torque (UK version) and 0-60mph in 5.4secs
with a top speed in excess of 165 mph?.

The car is seriously fast because of its excellent power to weight ratio. It
weighs just 1260kg (about 2700 Ibs). Acceleration is quite exceptional as are
the brakes and ABS. The engine requires 4000 rpm showing if you want to
accelerate in the higher gears. Others that have driven the car couldn't quite
get to grips with the fact that you can not just floor it in 5th at 60mph and
expect it to accelerate smoothly away. It does appear to have a lot less low end
tractability compared to a 944S2 or 2.7 for example. The turbo boosts to 1.8bar
hence it already uses quite a high pressure turbo. I have not enhanced the
performance any further. If the engine starts to show signs of wear (i.e. valve
guides) I may consider reworking it's power characteristics, but for the moment
it is fast enough. Also the suspension is fully adjustable in terms of toe and
castor and damping rates. The car is very sensitive to these settings and I will
have them checked yearly. The car will tramline very noticeably also. This is
annoying, but an unfortunate trait due to the wide 225/245 tyre combination.
Suspension is also very firm so don't expect a smooth ride over rough services.

The 944 range doesn't get quite as noticed as the 911, but when you compare the
relative performance and equipment of a '89 944 Turbo to a '89 911 3.2 Carrera,
the 944 Turbo has many advantages. The 944 Turbo costs a lot less. In the UK an
'89 911 Carrera 3.2 Coupe would cost between L18,000 - L25,000 depending on
mileage, colour and equipment (My 951 was L10,500 (UK Sterling)). The 911 can't
use unleaded fuel (UK model), has no ABS (no option) and no AirCon. It is more
expensive to insure, has 35/65 (ish) weight distribution and in many ways is
technically inferior. But it does have that unmistakable 911 shape and that
characteristic flat six engine noise and I still would like to own one (not as a
replacement), so I guess that sums it up. The 911 appeals in a very different
way. For me the 951 suited my requirements better. Performance first, looks and
image came second. If I buy a 911 (I just sold my 944S2 cabriolet - an excellent
investment!), then I guess it will be for the looks (first) and performance
(second).

As with any car, get a thorough test drive and independent examination. 951s are
tough and durable cars and should give you many years and miles of trouble free
high performance motoring. Good luck.

Regards,
Andrew Sweetenham
