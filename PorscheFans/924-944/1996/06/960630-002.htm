Yes, it is the late style. Actually the factory box has a label listing
951.106.021.01 with the last part over written in felt pen with 951.106.921 .
This part was ordered from US. When my local dealer pulled out his box,
the label was over written in the same manner.

That's the order I've got it now. I think maybe I need a thicker version of the
seal. RIght now, I can jiggle it in/out in the bore (approx 0.5 mm play) and
easily
move it sideways too.

Thanks for this tip. I thought there must be some purpose to that arrow.
I'll bring the pump into the dealer on Tuesday to sort the whole thing out.


BTW, for the Canadian waterpumper owners, I was able to locate a snap-ring plier
at the local Canadian Tire store for only $16. It comes with 4 tips (small
tip flat,
medium tip flat, med. tip 45 deg., med. tip 90 deg). This set is designed to
remove inner and outer snap rings. The 45 deg. tip easily removed the thermostat
snap-ring.
