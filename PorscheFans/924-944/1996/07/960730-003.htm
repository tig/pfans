     Thanks you are correct. Yes indeed the inline Reno (stock) radio
     harness fuse holder is marked for 1amp. In my car this blows.
     2amp seemed to work fine.  I have since replaced it with a
     blaupunkt new orleans (CD125 4X30w) and this unit has a 10amp
     inline fuse in the harness.  Anyway, it's fine except the radio
     reception is terrible and from what I have seen worst amongst,
     sony, clarion, etc, not to mention alpine or denon. I will
     probably replace it with a alpine or denon unit in the next
     couple of weeks.

Maybe Kevin was not thinking of the possibility of
an inline cartridge fuse in the radio harness.. .
  Maybe this is an aftermarket (re)installation?
  If so, you could easily do a 5 or 8 amp fuse for
the radio only.  Did I say radio only?  Assuming
the wire gauge is no thinner than 20ga.
  No other loads should be on the radio's pigtail
anyway. . .right?

  It's probably normal what you are seeing with the blown
1 or 1.5 amp fuse as you turn up the radio/tape/cd.
  Remember the Watts that drive your speakers
comes from the +12 input. . .a 5W/ch stereo amp will draw
peaks above 1.5 amps with volume set to hear.
  uh, I(amps)=P(watts)/E(volts)
