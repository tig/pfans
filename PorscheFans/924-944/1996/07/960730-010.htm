  A lot of things have improved in the last 30 years. . .
 -except most of 'em still burn gasoline internally.

 After seeing the Alfa documentary on TV. . .back
in 1925 the Alfaetta (sp?) V-8 did 450hp in racing
trim. . .this rather pales the Cisitalia effort some
decade later.  Not to mention the Porsche efforts,
which seem thin in comparison.
  If it werent for WWII and financial ruin, Alfa might've
beat Mercedes at their own game. .

  I'm not convinced that engine power has increased
THAT much, but longetivity at extended rpm where
gobs of power can hide has increased thru better
manufacturing and quality control.  Power to weight
ratios have changed a lot with the unibody cars coming
onto the scene.
   Mate that to a jet pack and voila! instant 'muscle' car. .
sort of.

  I've debated internally the why's of having an expensive
to maintain car in this day where even an econobox has
more ponies under the hood.  I come to the same
conclusion each time;  I like my Porsches because they
are different.  Because they have a 'character' that only
*I* can appreciate.  Each to his own. . .
  It is like art.  It's beauty in the eye of the beholder.
  -and the grass is always greener in the other lane
where that shiny new car is posing a challenge to
your wits, your wallet and your machine.  Pride Sucks.
