My favorite recent story is when I was at stoplight and a pickup truck 
was beside me in the curb lane. Past the lights were parked cars and we
were pointing down a hill. I figure why do I have to bust my ass and waste
fuel trying to beat this guy. So when the light turns green, I gun it for 
the first few yards like I'm actually going to race, but eventually let
him in. I think to myself, wouldn't it be great if there was a cop at the
bottom. And just as I had wished it, a cop steps out and pulls the pickup
over. I drive away smiling, as he disappears in my mirror...
