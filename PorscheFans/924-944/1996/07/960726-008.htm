Hi Bill.

There are three ways that brake fluid can get contaminated (that I know of).
This first is by boiling the fluid. This causes air in the brake lines,
and leads to black fluid, and a spongy feel. The second is a leak in
the system, that allows fluid out, and air in. This causes water to accum-
ulate in the system, because the air that gets in contains water, which
is absorbed by the brake fluid. The third way is by leaving the cap of
the master cylinder. The brake fluid will absord water from air that
is in contact with the open brake fluid reservoir. Always keep the cap
on the master cylinder for as long as possible when working on the
brakes. 

FYI, I have tried Castrol GT-LMA fluid. Now I use Ate fluid. I had
problems with the GT-LMA fluid boiling at the track. No such problems
with the Ate fluid.

Good Luck,
