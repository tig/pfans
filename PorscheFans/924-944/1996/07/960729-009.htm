Well, lessee now.

Porsche upgraded the power and torque in 1977 1/2 (or so says my old back
issue of Rodent Track).

                          924  (77 1/2)                            Neon
Horsepower        110 @ 5750 rpm                  132 @ 6000 rpm        
Torque               111 @ 3500 rpm                  129 @ 5000
Curb Weight       2575 lbs                               2338 lbs (base
model)
Tires (stock)        185/70 x 14                          165/80 x 13 (base)
                                                                      185/70
x 13  (highline)
                                                                      185/65
x 14 (sport)

So it's not surprising. The Neon weighs less, has 20 percent more power and
more than 15 percent more torque (but at higher rpm), and unless it's an el
cheapo special, has shorter tires (same width though) for slightly better
gearing (ignoring transmission and final drive.

It gets worse if you have the lower powered original version.
95 hp @ 5500, 109 ft-lbs @ 3000 rpm 

OK, let's look at gearing.

Overall gearing (gear ratio x final drive
                   76-77 924    77.5 924           Neon
1                 12.4               13.97           12.6
2                  7.33               8.26            7.56
3                  4.68               5.28            4.83
4                  3.30               3.76            3.66
5                  ----                 ---              2.56

Gearing of the first 924s is pretty close to that of the Neon. The 77.5 has
slightly shorter gearing which would help in a slalom, but not much.

So it's not surprising that the Neon can beat a 924. Engines have gotten a
lot more powerful in the past 20 years. Even little throwaway cars like the
Neon or Civic make 130ish horsepower. They weigh less, and front wheel drive
makes them easy to control and steer through a tight slalom course. In this
class, the cars don't have enough power to make rear drive necessary to put
the power down.

I've driven the Neon and it's a pleasant little box, for what it is. I'd take
this over other disposable cars like the Hyundais and Kias and whatnot.

Tires -- bald street tires are not any better than unbald street tires.
You're probably sliding around on rock-hard tires with no tread left. Invest
in tires. If they're legal in your group, Bridgestone RE-71 or Yokohama A008
RS or even RSII, that's the "slalom compound" which is illegal in a lot of
stock classes. For practical purposes, there's not much you can do about
weight and power short of re-engineering the car.
