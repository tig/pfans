I have a 1992 Porsche 968.  After work one day, little droplets of water
started shooting from the vents with the AC on.  The longer I drove, the
worse it got.  Then...I went to pass someone on a 2-lane road, and as the
RPM's increased, so did the amount of water pouring into my lap.
  Anyway, apparently my radio got wet also.  The sound quality immediately
sounded very garbled, so I shut off the radio.  A few hours later I got in
the car, and the radio was fine. THEN, a couple of hours later I hopped back
in the car, and the red LED which normally blinks was glowing red steadily
(no blinking).  The radio no longer turns on, and I cannot even attempt to
input my "code".  Any suggestions?  I can't even pull it out because I lack
the special tools.  Apparently, the AC drain hole is plugged up, which
caused the Niagra effect, but the radio is still in critical condition.  I
REALLY don't want to replace it...any help would be greatly appreciated.
