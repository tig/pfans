Well, this is kind of confusing. All that the socket wrench does is to push or pull 
the cable, just like the motor does.

Well, the unwritten spec on adjusting the microswitches is to put them so that the 
drive stops when the roof is full open, or full closed, or the arms are fully retracted,
but not so that they strip out the gears.

I would say that your 3rd microswitch is the culprit. You might jumpering around it to 
see what happens.

Don't forget to try swapping out the relays (same pn, one for up and one for down.)

No, it is not covered in the manuals.

Good Luck!
