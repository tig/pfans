OK...OK...I give up....I need help....the problem lies in the sun roof of my 87' 
944...yes I have read the owners manual and have the key in the right spot,etc...   
Thank You George B....
In the 1 spot I can unlock the roof but not lock it...the motor just runs but no 
movement by the little ratchet arms....I have to maually lock it with a socket wrench..
With the key in spot 11 or engine running I can open the roof....arms go up but not 
back..it looks like I have the two micro switches on the sun roof motor in the trunk 
area set improperly....they have an adjustment of about 1cm when the screw that holds 
them in place is loose...which mine was....I have moved it foward and backward with no 
luck...they work...tested with VoH Meter...last attempt I dicovered the 3rd micro switch 
on the backside of the motor...not tested yet....it looks thought that when the motor 
turns it moves a white plastic disc that activates the switches and where the switches 
are positioned is critical....does anybody have the specs on this or have you had this 
problem and was able to resolve? I do not have the shop manuals...no used available at 
Tweeks swap meet last weekend.....so I don't know if this is covered in the manuals..
I would appreciate any comments and or fixes...

Thanks....John Hora
