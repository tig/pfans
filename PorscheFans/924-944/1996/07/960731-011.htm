Kevin:

The ring and pinion setup on these gearboxes is really something.  The
shimming required to get them right makes most people absolutely nuts.  Not
only is it a pain, but I think I must have $500.00 worth of shims to do them.
 Not only do you need ever part number, but you sometimes need more than one.
 The differential shims are, as you are aware, under the bearing races.  In
the beginning, before I fiqured out the trick, every time you wanted to shift
the differential a little bit, you'd end up with a damaged shim.  So, you'd
have a pile of shims that you used to actually build the gearbox, and a pile
that you ruined in the setup.  The trick is to actually heat the case or the
sidecover quickly with a fairly big tip on your torch.  The bearing race and
shims will fall out if you get the heat and rate of heaating correct.  If you
know the direction that you are going to go, you can change the shims and
drop in the race before the case cools.  This also works for the pinion
bearing in the aluminum case.  As for the pinion bearing in the cast iron
portion...... If you fiqure that one out let me know.

Also watch out for the circlips under and over 3rd gear.  Always use a new
one on both sides.  Make sure that there is no trace of oil on the pinion
shaft or the gear.  These things spin off the circlips all the time.  On big
horsepower cars, we actually resorted to welding 3rd gear onto the shaft.
 Yeah, makes it tough to get to that pinion bearing on the shaft, but beats
having the gear spin.  Pretty clever of them to spline 4th gear in these
boxes because of the spinning problem and to leave third gear alone.
