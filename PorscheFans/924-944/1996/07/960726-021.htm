There's one in Toronto that's been for sale and advertised heavily.  I saw it 
recently in the Porsche's on Line for sale web site.  I don't have the address 
of the site easily accessible but I'm sure someone could give it to you.  My 
bet would be that most of the Rothmans Cars are in the GWN (grt wht nrth).  I 
looked at the possibility of buying one but getting it legally into the US was 
a problem. Even as a track only car.  The rational I was given was that the 
cars were or resembled production cars rather than single purpose race only 
cars and the DOT/EPA gods were concerned that the cars could end up on the 
street, evading safety and emissions laws.  So, by the time you added all the 
crap required to meet specs, the cost is prohibited and the car has been 
bureaucratically castrated.  It'd be nice to know how many others were in the 
US and how people got 'em here.

Hi Folks, I was wondering if anyone had information in regards to the  =20
availability of replacing or refurbishing Koni front dampers with spring  =20
collars for a 1986 944.

My 85/2 Rothmans Challenge 944 (8 valve) was equipped by the factory with =20=
=20
the M030 suspension that featured adjustable threaded collars and Koni  =20
dampers. I have been racing the car for the past few years and would like =20=
=20
to replace the units as the collars are a bit scruffy.

I would prefer to stick with factory parts as the originality of the car  =20
is important.

Anyone know the locations of the other 30 cars??

Best regards,
Erik Apotheker  =20
