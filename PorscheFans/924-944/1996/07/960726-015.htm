Here's my understanding:

A zero on the dashboard boost gauge means there is NO atmosphere, or a 
complete vacuum. Clearly, this can't happen, the intake manifold is
open on the intake side. A 1 on the gauge means that standard atmospheric
pressure of 14.6 psi (at sea level) exists.

At idle, there is so little exhaust pressure that NO boost will be generated.
In fact, as you point out, a vacuum will be generated as the fuel - air
mixture is sucked into the engine. That's why the boost is less than 1,
there is less than normal atmospheric pressure of 1 bar. The turbo is
not doing ANYTHING, and vacuum is used to suck the fuel and air into
the engine. The gauge should not go to zero, because the vacuum is not
that great, but will be below 1 bar.

As the engine starts to generate power, the exhaust gas volume increases
and the turbo spins faster. Now, instead of a vacuum SUCKING the fuel-
air into the engine, the turbocharger PUMPS the fuel-air into the engine.
The pressure in the intake manifold is higher than the 14.6 psi of
1 atmosphere, and the gauge starts to go above 1 bar. 

As the engine spins faster and faster, the turbo spins so fast that a
LOT of boost is created. So much that the engine would blow up if the
pressure was not released. The exhaust waste gate opens, and excess
exhaust gas is bled off to prevent the turbo boost from exceeding
the maximum value allowed. The max boost pressure is controlled by
the ECU (Engine Control Unit, or computer) according to values contained
in the KLR chip. 

Aftermarket chip manufacturers increase HP in turbocharged engines by
increasing the boost pressure. This can be done by changing the KLR
chip, changing springs in the wastegate, or by changing certain sensors
to fool the computer into allowing more boost.
