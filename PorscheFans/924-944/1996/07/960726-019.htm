Hi Erik,

It sounds like those are same struts use on the later cars with the 
M030 suspension. My car (89 Turbo) has the stock double adjustable 
(ride height and shock rebound) Koni. The ride height is adjusted by
threading the spring on the collar. If these are the same as your's
then a lot places sell the Koni units. Paragon Products in Texas
springs to mind. Brace yourself, because the font shocks are about
$400 a piece.

Good Luck,
