Hey everyone,

My problems is that If I plan to work on my car for a few hours, and
decided to listen to some tunes, the battery will be dead within that
time.  It won't start and I end up having to have a jump.  Attached to the
positive terminal of the battery is about 5 different red wires.  If I
attempt to remove them and reinstall them one by one to find out what they
are, could there be some serious damage done to the electrical system?  I
know that the previous owner(s?) had a cellular fone in the car because
the cables are still located behind the passenger foot rest.  Any
suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

P.S. On a side note, what did happen to P-Philes?  Please e-mail me
directly and not to the list.  Thanks!
