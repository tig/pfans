Greetin's fellow p-nuts.  With a great deal of apprehension I am considering
the sale of my 1987 944S to help during some upcoming financial squeaks (3
kids in college and parent's retirement nest-egg funds dropping fast).  This
car has been kept in perfect condition, under a cover in my garage since
new.  Only recently have I let it slip from concours condition to
probably-cleaner-than-your car-unless-you-show-it condition ... i.e., you
can still eat out of the engine compartment, but you might taste a little
dirt.  The car has no leaks or problems of any kind that I know of, except I
have been unable to trace the seemingly higher operating temp in recent
years, I think either I haven't been able to completely bleed the system or
the temp sending unit is wacky ... I replaced the thermostat, fan switch,
drained the coolant, etc. ... everything seems OK including the fan
switching on and off, just runs at the upper mark most of the time. (No
water leaks or water pump noise.)  

Of course I have replaced the timing belt and tension it regularly, the P201
tool I have can go with the car (not needed for '87's, but it still does the
other belts).  Car has about 46,000 mi on it, looks brand new, no cracked
dash, no faded paint, and has almost full tread Dunlop D2's on 16 inch phone
dial rims.  Recall on the oil cooler seals and fuel rack was also done.

I tracked the car a few times (intermediate run group) when it was under
warranty, but couldn't afford the apparent financial exposure since it came
off the factory warranty.  Gets about 4,000 mi a year of sunny day driving
only, and it has never seen snow or salt.

I think its worth about $11,000 and would expect it to be inspected by a
Porsche mechanic prior to sale.  I'd be willing to knock off a little to
compensate for the temp guage thing.  

BTW, to a good home only.  This hunk of metal has been pampered and its
molecules will expect similar reverent vibrations from the next owner.
