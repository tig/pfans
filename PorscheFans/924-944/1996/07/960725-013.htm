I couldnt glean enough detail from the post, but. . .

Have your tried Wurth HHS2000 ?

It it is the door release mechanism, the striker plate
seems to load up with crud and go sticky.
If it is the pull handle, there is a long rod that
goes from there to the doorhandle mechanism.
  Either way, these tend to load up with dust and
moisture/vapor making the mechanism balky.
  I went thru mine with carb cleaner and re-lubed
everything in sight.  er, do this with the guts out of
the car to retain your paint quality.

If it is the keylock. . .
um, depending on how much gink is in
the mechanism. . .graphite will do while its
warm outside, but when it freezes you might
not gain access because of hardened crud.
  If your gonna remove the door handle, go
the extra yardage and clean the key tumblers
as well and re-lube with silicone grease.  Its held
in with one screw, and a small return spring.
  They come from the factory packed full.
  It is not that involved a job, and the results are
fabulous the way the key glides and does the lock.
