>Thnaks to Kevin to take care of the Pfan 944 FAQ . Bravo.

Well, shucks.  I guess the least I can do in return is chime in.

>I'm totally confused now with one intermittent noise coming from the rear right
>wheel on my 85.5 non-turbo 944.

As a rule, a clunking, clicking, or thunking will indicate a CV.  A whirring
indicates the bearing.

>I just talk to my new mechanic and he told me that there is nothing loose with 
>my CVs. he didn't open anything but he is saying that they feel OK.

What does he think is the matter?

>I know for sure that there has been no maintenance on them for the last 50K
miles

At a minimum, time for complete tear-down, cleaning, inspection, and repack.

>1) Is it possible that it is bad even if it is not loose. 

Yes.

>2) He is telling me that it may be the differential sometimes they may
cause that
>type of noise ..... I'm wondering.

What's the noise?  Do you have limited slip or not?

>3) I guess that he should open everything at least to clean and repack coze 
>50K is since I own the vehicle .... I'm not too sure about previous 
>maintenance.

Yes.

>4) I didn't know about differential lubricant .... I thought it was the same as
>transmission oil. What is the maintenance on that?

One and the same on a 944, but it's a manual tranmission fluid, sometimes called
hypoid gear oil.  And it's not the same as ATF.  On the 944, the diff and the
gear carrier share a single pool of lubricant.  Other cars are different.

>Looks like it will take a bucket full of canadian money.

Not necessarily.  Don't panic yet.  The CV's are not obscenely expensive.
