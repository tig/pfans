Matt,

  I'm new to the 24/44 electronics, but charging
systems are not rocket science so. . .

  Your voltage measurement. . did you take the
reading immediatly after starting the car and then
run up the accessories, or was everything warmed
up prior?

  Some voltage droop is normal when maxing out the
accessory loads. . .provided the voltage does not
drop further during use, you might be ok.
  Where did you take the 11V measurement?
  -and your DVM. . .is it accurate?

  I think the regulator is built into the alternator on these?

  Ok, the battery is new, and you have a spare alt. . .are the
connections good at *both* ends of the heavy cables?
  And the heavy wire from the alternator, is it well connected?
  Sometimes the crimp fails on the wire's terminal, then you
get insufficient flow to run things off the alternator's output.

  Pep Boys can load check your alternator (i think)

  Also, the sounds the starter makes when cranking,
do they sound 'normal'?
