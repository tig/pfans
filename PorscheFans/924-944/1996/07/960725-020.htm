Andrew:

When it was said that this car had 1.8 bar in the manifold, I assumed that
the owner was actually reading manifold pressure, not the pressure from the
"want to be" guage in the dash.  (He didn't say that he had 1.8 bar on the
guage, he said he had 1.8 bar in the manifold, which confused me.)

We try to convert all our cars to a boost guage that reads real numbers in
the manifold, so I was a little lost.  1.8 bar in the manifold will blow the
head off of the motor.

Sorry,

Greg Brown
