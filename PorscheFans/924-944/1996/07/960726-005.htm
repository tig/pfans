Most turbocharged cars will smoke a little when under WOT (Wide Open Throttle).
This is normal, and should be expected. The smoke should be black, which
means it is caused my excess fuel in the combustion chamber.

This is done intentionally, and serves to help cool the exhaust valves
and turbocharger. When the fuel is vaporized in the combustion chamber,
it causes a drop in temperature (this is how A/C works, by having a 
gas vaporize). The excess fuel vaporizing is used to help cool the hot
exhaust valves and turbocharger. 

The smoke should only be under WOT. Not part throttle, and NOT when you
lift off the throttle.

Many cars will smoke a little when the have the throttle at WOT and then
lift (like for a shift). That smoke will be greyish, and is caused by
oil getting sucked into the combustion chamber by high vacuum from 
shuttinf the throttle down. It usually means the valve guides are worn.
As long as the smoke isn't excessive, I would just ignore it, and keep
a close eye on the oil level.
