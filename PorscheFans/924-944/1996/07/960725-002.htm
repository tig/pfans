Subject is :  Porsche 944 Turbo 1986 vintage
Problem: clutch has undefined problem

Questions:

Here is what the clutch pedal is doing /not doing.  On all my other cars
(they are average stuff, ford ranger etc)  The clutch pedal has a large
range of motion.  Somewhere from 12 to 16 inchs of travel.  I am assuming
that the 944 is not all that different.   

Well what happens when you push on the clutch pedal is that it starts 
to go down in its range of motion, but about 2-4 inches in its downward
motion it just stops.  If you try pushing you cannot move it.  Its like 
whatever the clutch is attached to, has hit an unmovable blockage.  

Does this sound like the clutch and pilot bearing do need repair or is
it just (please!) the master /slave cylinders?

I ask, because after reading the notes on how to replace the clutch, they
carted me off to the hospital for a cardiac arrest.  :)  :)   :)  :)

The shop was happy to do the work - at $1800. ouch.  So I will do it
myself, I just hate to spend 2 weeks doing it and then find out that what
was really wrong, was just the master/ slave cylinder.

Thanks for all the input so far, specially to Perci for the clutch info
(even though I turned white reading it :)     )
