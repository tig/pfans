Carlos:

Absolutely sorry to hear about the keying.

A process I learned from Jeff Baggett of Classic Car Motoring, Birmingham, 
AL, is (for scratches or chips) as follows.

  1.  Be as patient as possible -- don't rush!!!!
  2.  Obtain as close to the original paint as possible, both type and 
color.  The color is critical.  The paint on my '87 944 is BASF urethane 
acrylic, Guards Red, and Classic Car was able to provide me an outstanding 
match, by eye, in pint quantities.
  3.  Mix a small amount of paint as per manufacturer's instructions for 
hardener, then dilute with reducer.
  4.  Use a very fine high-quality brush, or a hypodermic syringe, and 
carefully fill the scratch in thin layers, letting each layer cure.  It's 
critical to keep the new paint inside the scratch or chip, just so it 
contacts the edge of the damaged area.  Jeff encouraged me to use a lighted 
magnifying glass so the scratch filling is more easily observed.  (Even 
though I'm near sighted, this works great).
  5.  Continue to fill the damaged area until the new paint is slightly 
above the original, then let the paint cure a reasonable amount of time, 
then add perhaps a few days more.
  6.  Here's the step where you can damage your finish if you rush -- color 
sanding the damaged area.  I use 2000-grit wet-or-dry paper.  Viewing 
through magnifying glass, very carefully sand only the damaged area, until 
the new paint surface is level with the original paint.  Rushing or careless 
work at this point can easily result in edge cutting of the original paint 
through to the primer.
  7.  Finish the job with a high-quality glaze.

I'm positive there exists other techniques.  This one takes a lot of time, 
but the results have been outstanding.  Rock chips practically disappear.  
Again, the important factors are to have the color match and the original 
paint type.

Rock chips are something we are forced to encounter, if we drive our 
Porsches on public roads, even if you don't tailgate.  Bras work great, but 
you can't leave them on -- or they damage the paint.  I found periodic 
checks and chip repair keeps the 944 looking great.

By the way, absolutely don't use lacquer (unless that was the original 
paint).  I've also obtained very poor results using the touch-up paint sold 
by Porsche.

As George B. says, good luck!

Cheers,

Pete Morley
'87 944
