FWIW, my 931 shows around 10 inches of Hg vacuum in the manifold at 65 mph
on a straight and level roadway.  That's around 0.7 bar absolute pressure.
If the throttle plates are shut entirely, I get about 20 in Hg vacuum if the
engine is turning more than 1000 RPM. At idle it sits at 17-18 inches.

I've tested her at 0 vacuum/0 boost, and on the level I gradually attain
85-90 MPH.  The fuzz factor here is due to the fact I'm not just looking at
the speedometer, but also looking very carefully for "fuzz", i.e. the 
NC Highway Patrol.  They love to catch P-cars and I've already donated my 
fair share to the police malevolent society.

At full boost of 13 psi (0.9 bar), it's anybody's guess.  No guts, no glory
I suppose.  Before I replaced the weakened wastegate spring, 7 psi was all
she'd give and top speed was around 130.
