Hi everyone ....

Thnaks to Kevin to take care of the Pfan 944 FAQ . Bravo.

I'm totally confused now with one intermittent noise coming from the rear right
wheel on my 85.5 non-turbo 944.
After reading dozens of email from the old pfiles I was sure that I had a bad CV
joint ... because of :
    - the noise
    - the relation with throttle 
    - kindof sync with wheel rotation

The only thing is that it was occuring in a straight line and not while cornering
+ that something it was just fine for a whole day and sometimes I could hear it
for a long time (but when it was gone I couldn't induce it easily).

I just talk to my new mechanic and he told me that there is nothing loose with my
CVs. he didn't open anything but he is saying that they feel OK.

I know for sure that there has been no maintenance on them for the last 50K miles

1) Is it possible that it is bad even if it is not loose. 

2) He is telling me that it may be the differential sometimes they may cause that
type of noise ..... I'm wondering.

3) I guess that he should open everything at least to clean and repack coze 50 K
is since I own the vehicle .... I'm not too sure about previous maintenance.

4) I didn't know about differential lubricant .... I thought it was the same as
transmission oil. What is the maintenance on that?

I'm going there right away over there so I'll be on-line tomorrow morning .... so
the car will surely still be in the shop for more checks.

TIA

Looks like it will take a bucket full of canadian money.
