This may be a shot in the dark, but I had a persistent noise from the rear
of my 87 951 that turned out to be loose brake pads. I learned from the old
PPhiles list that you could put thin aluminum shims under the pads to shut
them up. Test is whether or not the noise persists when you barely apply the
brakes.

good luck
