The IT racing is real tough and lots of banging. You sound much better 
suited for PCA club racing.

I think a 911 is cheaper and easier to maintain but I'm biased ;-).
A 944 could be a better starter track car.

About the same I think. Wheels will be more if you go for the
Fuchs forged alloys which are the best available. I don't think
you need an LSD in a normal 944, not much power and
lots of traction. A factory LSD would be GREAT but very
hard to find in a cheap car. Too expensive to add either
factory or aftermarket LSD to a 944 I think.

I'll copy this to the 944 list, you should join it now to get an idea
of the problems/solutions/etc that they have.
