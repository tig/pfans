Excuse me.

  Am I missing something here?
  Even those of us who dont race, find their
brake fluid looking black.  On 944's in particular
the clutch is a hydraulic system that shares the
brake fluid at the reservoir.  From the pumping
action of the clutch during normal usage, the fluid
may be getting some circulation and making the
reservior fluid appear contaminated (which it probably is).
  I'm sure the master cylinder contributes to this as well,
but on the 944 it seems to happen faster than other cars
that dont share the clutch servo with the brake reservoir.

  I perform a careful flush of the reservoir, using an
ear syringe to remove the fluid as far into the reservoir ports
as possible.  I wipe out the container with clean paper
towels (no lint) and refill the reservoir *before* a pressure
flush of the rest of the system.
  Even then, some gink remains in the clutch servo system.
  Unless you go the extra yardage to flush that too. (fanatic!)

  I really doubt most deserving PO's go around with their
brake reservoir uncapped, or their systems open for very
long.    The black crud comes from the wearing rubber
parts in the hydraulic circuits and slow oxidation of the
metals in fluid contact. (imhe).  Racing would seem to
accelerate the process?
