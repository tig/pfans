Hello,
  I had a really bad experience at work in June 1976.
  I parked my 73 914 in the lot with the other
stationary speed bumps.  It was a nomally
windy kansas day. . .50mph gusts with a 35mph
steady.  At the end of the day, there was a
foot long vertical crease in the driver side door
from where someone's car door got loose in
the wind.  Oops!, then they moved. . .

  Since then, I park as far as possible from the door.
  I get some extra excercise, and maybe I do appear
elite (well dammit, *I* am) but I never get whacked
at work.  I do about the same thing elsewhere.

  But what works best is just driving a car with a
really sore paint job.  It wont matter if someone
door slams you, and you will just laugh at some
turkey keying your hood.  -get any on you?

  -kyle
   Sometimes it could be a bummer to have
a nice shiny Porsche.
