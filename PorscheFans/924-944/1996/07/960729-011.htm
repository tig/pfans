Hi Gang,

Since I'm coming to terms with the idea that I have to replace my
clutch, and since the exhaust system has to come off to replace 
the clutch, I'm thinking that this would be a good time to install
an aftermarket exhaust system.

I'm looking for information from 944 turbo owners who have changed
the exhaust system. I'm looking for:

  1. Performance: I like to drive on the track, so additional
     HP is a GOOD thing. I'll probably replace the catalytic
     converter with a 'test pipe' -No sermons, please. The car is
     mostly driven to / from the track, and on the track.

  2. Weight: If I can save some pounds over the stock system, that
     is a GOOD thing.

  3. Noise: The current exhaust is too quiet. A louder exhaust would
     be nice, but I have to meet noise restrictions at Bridgehampton
     and Lime Rock, so it can't be too loud.

  4. Ease of Installation: I don't have a welder, so the system has
     to fit right out of the box.

  5. Cost: Obviously, less is better.

Misc: My car is an 89 turbo (Turbo S). Does that change anything?
Also, in order to take full advantage of the new exhaust, is an after-
market chip required? Currently, I have the stock chip. Are there
any packages out there, say like a Borla exhaust and an Autothority
chip, or is everything 'a la carte?' Any special places to order
or stay away from? I see lots of ads from Turbo Performance Center,
Windward Performance Center, PowerHaus, JT Engineering, etc.

I'm still in the dreaming, as opposed to planning, stage, so this 
is a good time to start sorting fact from fiction.

Thanks,
Barry Lenoble
