You sure the heat shield metal underneath the car is installed
and not rusted-out ?

There are a couple of such things underneath my 924, one is a
sheet-metal that is fixed between the exhaust pipe and the car
unibody. And another thing is heat-insulating blankets that are
pasted onto a couple of parts of the body underneath, closer to
the engine area and, near the clutch bell-housing.

If the car had any clutch or exhaust work done, these things
tend to take a one way ticket off the car, in the hands of
lesser mechanics. One so-and-so that my PO used to take the car
to left the heat cover of the catalytic off, so I am very
careful where I park, esp. in the fall with all that dry leaf
around. (That so and so also did some interesting things, like
install the gear-shift lever flipped over :)

BTW, talking of Neon's ... yeah, they are fun cars sure. But not
them automatics. Had the opportunity, or the way I look it at
it, the desparate need forced by the small matter of certain
whining passengers not being happy with my rear seats -- I just
dont get it, whats wrong with these people! :-) Drove a new Neon
up and down the hillier parts of NH.

The tranny kept guessing wrong gears each time, not downshifting
on an upslope till the upslope was all but over. Trying to
double guess the engine rpms and the kickdown logic did not
always work.  I really missed my 924 there, on those rolling
hills the manual would have been funnnn!!!

But then, my favorite camera is also the Yashica FX-3 all
manual.

Best,
