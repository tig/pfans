Pete,
  Have you been bleeding/flushing your
reservoir and/or keeping the brake pads thick?

  This '84 specimen definitely had darkened
brake fluid, and had been neglected by the former
po.  I would take this as 'typical' because I've seen
this on other non-P-cars with hi-miles and near
total neglect (except to keep things topped off).
  Here was my clue:  worn down to nubs brake
wear sensors and wear tolerance rotors.
  In this case, the car has not been used for anything
more than daily jaunts to Boeing and back, 75k
worth. .

  It would seem worse on cars with a combination
of wear limits on rotors/drums and pads/shoes
because overstroking the brake hydraulics
cycles fluid in and out of the reservoir along with
the wear particles and other contaminants.

  I agree that moisture is a contaminant, but how does
it get into a nearly closed system when it goes from
a freshly opened bottle to the reservoir, then caps on?

  There is a vent at the top of the cap and the fluid is
hygroscopic.  The system naturally experiences
thermal expand/contract cycles that could cause
the reservoir to 'breath' . . . is this how?

  Anybody know the water absorption rate of brake fluid?

  Sorry to beat this to death. . .
