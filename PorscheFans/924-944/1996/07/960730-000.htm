I've had a problem with my '77 924 since I aquired it a year ago.  If
the engine is running and all the accessories are turned off the voltage
reads around 13v.  If I turn on the headlights, wind shield wipers,
radio, etc. it drops to 11v - or even lower.  I have a spare alternator
so I swapped the two but no change.  The belt is nice and tight and the
battery is new.  I also verified the low voltage with a DVM.  The
battery conenctions are all nice and clean.  I've read something about
bad grounding to the battery on the 924 - my battery cables haven't been
replaced as far as I know.  
Any thoughts?  
Thanks,
Matt

Hi Gang,

As the Auto-X chairman for Metro NY region, I am always looking for ideas 
to get more people to our events.  So last year I setup a season 
championship for our final event of the year and called it the "Metro 
Runoffs."  It featured the top ten drivers of the year as determined by a 
points system from the prior events.  These driver would all drive the same 
guest car at the Runoffs so the variability of car performance was not an 
issue.  May the best DRIVER win.

I was hoping to get something unusual for the guest car.  Not a Porsche, 
though, since it would put some drivers at an advantage or disadvantage.  
I had some connections for a Viper, a Volvo T5R and a Jaguar.  They all 
fell through.  I finally got a PCA member, Mr. Wrent A. Kar, to donate his 4 
door, automatic, NEON.

Bottom line is the winning driver in the NEON finished second overall at 
the event (though it was a tight course).  A '95 993 was FTD and '95 
bi-turbo was third.  The driver is always the most important part of the car.

Henry

P.S.  This year I hope to get something really cool.  Maybe a Yugo?
