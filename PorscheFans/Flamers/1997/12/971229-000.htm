Hello All,

     I wanted to jot down a few lines quickly to express an opinion.  I have
noticed recently all the conversation about Windward Performance.  Everything
which I have read has been negitive and I am wondering if perhaps someone has
an ax to grind.

     My experience with Windward has always been professional, courteous and
helpful.   Items which I have pursched have been correct, priced properly and
delivered in a timely fashion.  I have spent a moderate sum with Windward for
my 89 930, (headers, turbo and Intercooler).  Everything has been as
represented, and the experience has been pleasant . . . contrary to my
experience with some mail order Porsche establishments.   Obviously there was
a problem with communication, but I have never had that problem.

     Additionally, one of the loudest protestors I believe is Alan Coleman.
Well, Alan, I am not sure I would put merit into anything you discuss . . .
and here is the reason why . . . I also own a 93 RS.   I read your article
concerning adjusting the potentiometer switch on the DME box's.   Boy do you
have a wrong number!   Yes, that switch is adjustable, if you know which way
to turn it, and which number box you have....every series and year box is
different.  I.E., a 93 doesn not adjust as an 91 does, and so on.    To listen
to you, they are all the same.       hmmm.          .wrong move.  I am
wondering how many individuals have damaged their engines with this
misinformation.   Seems Alan, if you care to become the town crier and smack
someone down, he without sin should cast the first stone, and perhaps not live
in a glass house.   Just my thoughts, wanted to share them.
