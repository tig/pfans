Dearest Ron,

Besides *warmest* season's greetings, which I certainly proffer in
abundance, the time has come to offer you a little friendly tip as well; to
wit:

One copy of each of your announcements is quite adequate for letting us
know what you have on your mind.  We are Porsche fans, after all. The
keen-ness of our grasp of these matters, and our ability to comprehend your
message after the fifth or sixth notification is amply demonstrated by that
fact, alone.

857 copies, (the approximate number that has reached yer kindly ol' Unka
Bart at last count)  on the other hand, is a *trifle* excessive.  To the
point that they have become annoying, not to put too fine a point on this.

So I implore you, do be a good fellow, Ron, old kumquat, and cease and
desist at once any further sending and/or re-sending of any more these
announcements.

Otherwise, Ron, mon cher rutabaga, I shall be *forced* to hunt you down
remorselessly, and whack you severely about the head and shoulders with a
moldy olive-loaf.  Yes, the very same loaf last used by Opus the penguin
when he laid waste to an entire troup of (similarly annoying) Mimes.

Not a pretty sight, I assure you...
