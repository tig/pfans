Jay-

I always appreciate your comments, and it's true that you are often one
of the few people who respond to questions from newcomers.

Having been a long-time member of the porschephiles and porschefans
mailing lists, I find this thread reprehensible, unless it is firmly
'tongue in cheek'.

Please feel free to respond whenever and wherever you like!
