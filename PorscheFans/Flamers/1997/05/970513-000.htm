	I know I'm not the only one on the list with car cleaning
	information. But I may very well be the only one (or two
	or three) people with this information who reply...
	That happens all the time.

	Woooo...Porschefans is ganging up on me. Joe and his buddies
	think I need a flaming and wish I would go away. That's just
	great, Joe. Sadly for you, your point is pretty much ivalidated
	by the dozens and dozens of email messages I've gotten that
	say, "...thanks, Jay, I never would've thought of that/known
	that/considered that if you hadn't mentioned it..."

	Is there something wrong with this advice for
	a new 911 buyer?

> "Contact Car Care Specialties"

	Is there something wrong with this
	for someone looking for car care help?

> "I hate Porsche dealers, you should too"

	Posted in the general group where it belonged,
	not the 911 list.

	Somehow, I don't think Vic is a great guy. Vic (and you) sound
	like the worst of the Porsche owners, the elitests. The people
	who take shots at other people to build themselves up. The people
	who look down at the 914, etc.

	Porschefans is a discussion group of people from all over the
	world. People with tons and tons of different experiences
	including different levels of experience. I give advice about
	the things I know something about when someone (usually a newbie)
	asks. I stand by the advice I've given. I think that if I were
	the idiot that you and Vic imply that I am, Pete would've said
	something to me by now (he will after this goes to the 911 list,
	sorry Pete, I won't send anything else there but I just couldn't
	let this character assassination go by). Pete usually is pretty
	good about that sort of thing. You know, your opinion and Vic's
	really don't bother me much; the world is full of people who like
	to open their mouths and take digs at others. The thing that does
	bother me, though, is that fact that there are newbies and lurkers
	on this list who are reading your posts. New Porsche owners who
	might have questions or might be able to offer that one little
	piece of advice that someone needs, but now they won't because
	they don't feel like becoming a target. This is a moderated list,
	Joe, but you're not the damned moderator. I (and others) don't
	tell you and Vic when and when not to post so I'd appreciate it
	if you'd at least allow the rest of us the same courtesy.
