Jay, (or Jerry):

Vic was right, you should refrain from responding to month-old posts.  I'd
be suprised if you were the only one on this list with car cleaning
information.  It would be very sad if we all had to wait around for you to
impart your vast wisdom upon us.

It has been very nice to follow P-fans for the past 6-8 weeks you've been
away. I have had several off-list dialogs with people who feel that you were
long overdue for a flaming and hoped that you would just go away.   Maybe if
you could refrain from offering the following advice and instead started
sharing meaningful information and *FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE* we wouldn't feel
this way.  

In the past your responses can be pretty much summed up as:

"According to Bruce Anderson" or "Buy Bruce's Book"
"Contact Car Care Specialties"
"I hate Porsche dealers, you should too"
"According to previous P-fans discussions you should..."  Blah blah blah
about brake pads, chips, tires, or nose hair clippers
>"Buy yellow Konis, you won't beleive the difference in your cars handling"
>"Someday I'm gonna' ......"

In short, think before you post, don't post just to see yourself in "print",
and we may all be happier.

BTW, Vic is a great guy on line and in person.  He's a member of our local
region and always willing to lend a hand.  Remember who put his own money at
risk to facilitate a group purchase of the latest version of Bruce's book?


Sorry for the bandwidth,  just had to get that off my chest.  Have sent a
copy to Flamers if anyone wishes to continue this silly thread (or just
agree with me).
