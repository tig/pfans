At the risk of drawing fire,  I don't understand why these exchanges are
on the list.  If someone is behaving in an "unacceptable" manner I think
the proper way to deal with it is either in private correspondence with
the person and/or by contacting the listmeister if private communication
does not resolve the problem.  
 
If one feel someone needs a public rebuking then I feel it should be
done on the "Flamers" list.  I suspect there are fewer people on the
"Flamers" list than the "General" or the "911" list and that is probably
an indication of the general interest in flames. 

This does not mean that general requests are inappropriate but I think
this can be done in a way that is possibly less confrontational 

I understand that this post is to some extent a violation of my own
proposal/comment. I apologize for that but could think of no more
appropriate way to proceed.

If anyone has a desire to respond yea or ney to this privately so as not
to clutter the list I will post the results.  

FWIW
