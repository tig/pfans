<< (In a completely rationale sense, I personally believe that Ignacio Lopez
was
 the illegitimate offspring of Ferry Porsche and Eva Braun's sister as a
 result of their meeting at the Volkwagen "rollout" in 1938.  Ignacio was
 "spawned" strictly to try to destroy General Motors in later years as a
human
 "Time Bomb" in retaliation for GM's failure to institute suppliers reforms
 and Just in Time Inventory at Adam Opel AG in 1938 prior to the Nazi
 government takeover of the firm.  As a result, Opel made "miserable"
 production contribution during the early war years and was a primary cause
of
 the German defeat in WWII.....:))) >>

Naah... He's Ferdinand Piech's illegitimate son by his Spanish babysitter,
conceived while they were testing the 917 prototypes at Jarama. Through
skillful use of makeup, Lopez was made to look more "mature" to be better
qualified for the job. As for Opel, you insinuate that they deliberately
dragged their heels in producing military hardware under the Nazi regime.
That is an outright lie. Opel did  a fantastic job of producing war toys, for
a GM division. If you don't believe it, there are probably reams of ISO 9000
documents and internal TQM (Total Quality Management) reports to prove it. 

As for German defeat in WW2, that's _exactly_ what they want you to believe.
They got rid of all their old worn-out machine tools, which are still being
used to build Jaguars, and started afresh. France, Italy, and Britain "won"
the war -- and look at their cars. Then we have the "losers" -- Mercedes,
Porsche, BMW, Audi. VW doesn't count because it's a Mexican car company.

I once asked a German friend what he thought of ISO 9000. "Great idea.
Finally there's an established set of rules for assuring quality." I said
that I thought it was just more Eurocratic bullshit to keep more overeducated
European university graduates at comfy, high-paying desk jobs. "But it isn't
European, it was invented by GM." I said that that proves it, ISO 9000 is not
an effective way to guarantee quality, just look at any GM product.
