For Jay (sorry I don't have your email address) and other PFans in general:

First, let me say I agree entirely with the nice reply posted by Scott
Winders (the kinder, gentler, Porschefans Scott); it's often the relatively
new and enthusiastic members like yourself who take the time to post
information, that while seemingly redundant to "oldtimers", keeps new
subscribers informed and keeps the list alive and vibrant.  It's easy enough
for most of us who have been around for a long time to not reply on "old
hat", forgetting that the list keeps growing and changing with subscribers
coming and going.  I have no problem in just deleting redundant material
while taking the chance that I may miss something "new".

I would offer (for all, not related necessarily to your posts) the following:

1. Try to scan the list of messages before replying to see if (in your view)
an adequate response has already been provided.  Be willing to delete your
reply before sending if it adds no "new" or relevant content (recognizing
that messages may pass in transmittal).

2. Don't feel "obligated" to reply to everything.  While many of us probably
feel we know "everything" about Porsches, the truth may be that we all have a
few things on which we have relevant experience to contribute and
share...nonetheless, don't be afraid to post because of presumed "expert
opinion" on the list.  (The Mercedes list, for example, has been on "deaths
door" several times when "Chat Room" subscribers got carried away...)

3. Be cautious in quoting or citing "Know Experts or Legends Still Believed
Living" who may be on the list (for example, "The Bruce" vs. "a Bruce".  We
often recite opinions with which we "a priori" agree  and sometimes misquote
the true source, context, or content.  I think it entirely appropriate to
reference available written or on-line sources.

Lastly, a good "Flame War", unless destructive to the point of losing valued
subscribers, never hurt anyone.   I sometimes miss  the more confrontational
dialogue that sometimes erupted on the Porschefiles List.  Aggressive,
assertive, (and sometimes inflammatory debate) adds interest to the list and
insight on the personalities and viewpoints of subscribers.  I would even
hope the our List Meister, Pete, would periodically insert "self-igniting"
material into the Flamers List he provided for us just for such purpose. 

(In a completely rationale sense, I personally believe that Ignacio Lopez was
the illegitimate offspring of Ferry Porsche and Eva Braun's sister as a
result of their meeting at the Volkwagen "rollout" in 1938.  Ignacio was
"spawned" strictly to try to destroy General Motors in later years as a human
"Time Bomb" in retaliation for GM's failure to institute suppliers reforms
and Just in Time Inventory at Adam Opel AG in 1938 prior to the Nazi
government takeover of the firm.  As a result, Opel made "miserable"
production contribution during the early war years and was a primary cause of
the German defeat in WWII.....:)))
