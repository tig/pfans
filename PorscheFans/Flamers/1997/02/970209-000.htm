This is not a "news group". You are subscribed to a list, mail reflector or
a mail group.

There are some bad things happening.

This list is free. The spectrum and time invested in care and feeding of
the list costs your or I nothing. Booth are donated. No one likes to see
the things that are happening (mail loops..ect) but on occasion they are
inevitable. Shit happens. If you don't care to participate it is simple for
you to unsubscribe. Please don't burden the "listmeister" with your "brow
 beating". I'm sure they are doing the best they can to rectify the situation.
Your public posting was in poor taste, hence this note (not sent to the
reflector).
So..... that said.. Back to the Porsche talk:-)

ps.. this was not written as a flame, please don't take it as such. Sometimes
you have to sift thru the crap to get to the good stuff. Use a filter like
procmail
or use your mailcli to make a killfile and you won't "see" the loops.
