Reposting JImboMGA's latest here as seed for this ongoing flame war. Keep it
over here, not on the 911 list. If it spills over there again, I'm throwing
people off -- probably starting with JimboMGA@aol.com just because I want to,
and for running off at the keyboard.

And there you have it, the project is complete.
It took a while but, I've managed to coral the 911 crowd to the place from
which most of their misquotes, unfounded assumptions, and weird thinking
comes.
"Excellence was Expected".
Nice (in fact, fascinating) book. But, it has that same annoying quality that
the worlds most popular book has. "If I think this, and it's written in this
pretty book that everybody likes, than of course, it is the unasalable
truth."
No, I don't want to argue about the book. That's not the point. Read all the
books, but, while you're doing the reading know that all you are doing is
strolling through what someone else wants you to believe, you don't find
truth in books. The closest I've ever come to finding truth in a book was a
little book titled "Hype" published in the late 70's.
Think you're own thoughts.
Have your own opinions.
Your car is not superior, mine is.
I'm getting a little sketchy here, let me draw in the focus a bit, consider
this;
Way late in the 50's Porsche sees that the 356 is running out of the
incredible steam it had for so very long. Development on the 901 is
progressing apace. Porsche releases small fragments of information to the
automotive press about the demise of the 356. Response Porsche receives
(gasps and vitriol) tells them they had better find a way to ease the 356
devotees into the next evolution.
The 912/911 tandem project is firmed up and begun in earnest. Work, work,
work, design, design, work, work. 911 is released first so as to let the
automotive press spin up on the new chassis and engine, the 356 does it's
'victory lap' year, good bye old friend.
912 is released and a very odd thing happens, it out sells the 911 by around
30%.
Oh shit! We've designed the perfect marketing debacle. We are competing
against our own flagship product, and beating it. The 912 must die! It's too
much car for the money. We've spent a bazillion dollars designing a flat-six
engine that can't compete with our flat-four (S90 many call it).
912 is marketed in its final years as a lesser vehicle frankly, a ladies
Porsche, the entry level/beginners Porsche. They even jack up the price of
the 912 to within just a few hundred dollars of the 911T and the 912 still
sells very very strong (within a couple thousand units of the 911).
And on an even further back-channel funny things are happening with the folks
at Volkswagon...
OK, the 912 is dead, 911 sales are picking up, most of the bad things about
the flat-six engine are well in hand. Happy happy Porsche.
Consider it. Believe it. I don't care.
I've been in marketing, advertising, and design enough years to know the pap
that gets presented as fact in regard to the 911/912 early linage is a fairy
tale.
"912 was an after thought", not a chance. Damn near proved to be the better
thought.

and as for Scotts "By the way, Jimbo, junk the attitude....." comment;
My fans live for this attitude! Don't ya hear them cheerin' Scott? They love

me.

"I'm so glad we had this time together,
To have a laugh and sing a song... Good night every body."
I'd like to thank all the people who've made this performance possible:

the original question: Stephen Jacobs (sorry about that exposed nerve)
John from JMCARRERA@aol.com (nice sidestep)
The puppets:
Scott Winders
Bob Dunn
Allen Henderson
Ted from "EHSMITH.US.ORACLE.COM"
Bill D
Mark Honman

Support Staff:
Pete co-listmeister (couldn't have done it with out ya, man)

I bet none of this would've happened if I could drive my car in the winter.
Damn that sodium.

Say, does anybody know what the "RS" stands for in 911RS?
