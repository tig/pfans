    God DAMN it, this guy's pissing me off... Two weeks ago, he
    spammed the entire P-Fans list hierarchy with:

> Some informations on zymol and those who would like to take care
> of their car using zymol but not paying those high prices.  I use
> zymol on my porsche and have found it to be the best.  I have found
> a zymol wholesaler on the internet from who I stock up on zymol. 
> their prices are very good.
> 
> the site is:  http://pages.nyu.edu/~kql2938/

    and now he's doing it again:

> From: Kapil Luthra <kl4@stern.nyu.edu>
> Subject: car waxing
> 
> Hi i just got my car wax.  zymol, and am going ot try it out this
> weekend. anyone out there have any experience in how to use the
> stuff. on a new car especially?  Also want to tell everyone that I
> found the cheapest site on the internet for zymol , so everyone
> check it out and save lots of money.
> 
> http://pages.nyu.edu/~kql2938/
> 
> please let me know about experience using zymol.

    I wouldn't mind so much if he came out and SAID that he was a  
    Zymol distributor, but his simple-minded "I just discovered wy 
    own web page" bullshit just insults my intelligence.

    What's worse, his "k14@stern.nyu.edu" account isn't subscribed to
    all the P-Fans sub-lists to which he posted his advertisement...
    And as we're all aware from our recent experience with Bill
    Bechtold's "Sport Seats" message, crossposting messages to P-Fans
    lists to which you aren't subscribed confuses the listserver and
    makes it send duplicate copies of your message to every
    subscriber for weeks.

    So now we can all look forward to receiving hundreds of
    duplicate copies of this moron's blatant commercial spam. 

    Sigh... I can't wait.
