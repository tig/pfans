Is this flamer bait or what?  If you really exist, Alex, your diatribe
demonstrates why the original "Do you know the difference between a
Porsche owner and a porcupine?" joke was created.

Some of us have owned Porsches for twenty years or so, drive "early"
cars, entry level Porsches.  If you don't want to or know how to answer
a non-owner's question, refer them to a Porsche owner that does.  Do you
flash your headlights?

Cheers,
