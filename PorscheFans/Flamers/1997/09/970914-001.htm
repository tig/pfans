I don't mean to give you a hard time, Alex, but there will always be
people who misunderstand why you drive a Porsche.  It can be fun talking
to non-Porsche people who have a genuine curiosity in the cars.  Racers
are preoccupied, but all they have to say is "can I talk to you later?" 
Like others have commented, we have a much more serious problem with
street racers can't wait to show up a Porsche.

As for the neighbors who think you bought the car for a status symbol,
why not explain that many Porsches cost less than a new Toyota
[particularly a Land Cruiser]?  A limited production manufacturer like
Porsche survives because the old ones are still around.  Frequently the
old ones are still around because they are the entry level cars.  I
bought mine because of the design, and because it was an older
affordable one.  Would you agree it's a good thing to encourage others
to take an interest in Porsches?
