Aloha Porsche Lovers,

Can someone help me? 

I have a '87 944 NA, automatic.  I consistantly get 19mpg at best, no
matter how non-aggressively I try to drive.  There are no gasoline smells
as an leaky Evaporative Emission canister would indicate, and I my K&N air
filter is clean.  What else can contribute to the poor milage?  Or is that
the best a 10yr.old automatic can achieve?  

Also, my front tires 205/55/16 are worn.  I am wondering if it's alright to
put my current Porsche "Phone Dial" rears (tire and rim)-225/50/16 in the
front, and purchase new 255/40/17 for the back.  
	1) Would the front clear alright? and would that setup create bad stress
for the front arm and steering components?  For some reason my 944 uses 951
front struts, would this be a factor in the equation?
	2) Would the 17inch rear and 16inch front setup be bad for the car somehow?  

Lastly, which tires are recommended?  I heard CompT/A ZR (cheaper for me)
provide good grip for pealing out and drags, but not good for hanging
turns, is this true?  Since my 944NA doesn't have a lot of power, I'm more
interested in the grip in a turn.  All advises are greatly appreciated.

Much thanks,
Tony C:
