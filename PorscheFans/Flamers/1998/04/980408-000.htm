DEAR MR DENNIS GRAY,

I READ YOUR LETTER REGARDING THE MISFORTUNE OF THE K-29.

WE HAVE FOUR FULL TIME PEOPLE AND I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY YOU HAVE NOT =
BEEN CONTACTED.  HOWEVER, I DO INTEND TO FIND OUT WHY, AND I WOULD LIKE =
TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE INCONVIENCE.  PLEASE CONTACT ME PERSONALLY OUR =
TELEPHONE NUMBER IS: 800-642-1348.

THE K-29'S WE SELL HAVE A LARGER THAN ORIGINAL SHAFT WITH A REVERSED =
THREAD PITCH.  ALL K-26, K27 AND K29, KKK TURBO'S HAVE HAD THIS FEATURE =
SINCE ROGER PENSKE TOOK OVER KKK, 21/2 YEARS AGO.  I WILLCONCUR THAT ALL =
K-29'S PRIOR TO THIS REVISION, UNDER EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES WERE =
POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC. WE HAVE SOLD BETTER THAN 150 OF THESE TURBO'S, =
AND  WE HAVE EXPERIENCED ZERO PROBLEMS OR COMPLAINTS.

REGARDING THE NOMENCLATURE OF THE K-29-11, THIS TURBO WAS ORIGINALLY =
USED ON THE VERY FIRST FACTORY 962.  IN THE LATE 80'S LOUIS RUF MODIFIED =
THE K-29 TO WORK ON THE 930'S.  HE NAMED IT "DER GOSSE K-27", ( THE BIG =
K-27 ).  THIS WAS HIS TURBO OF CHOICE FOR MANY YEARS AND IT WAS SOLD =
WITH HIS BTR II SYSTEM.  THE BTR I USED THE K-27.

IN APPROXIMATELY 1995, ROGER PENSKE PURCHASED THE MAJORITY OF KKK STOCK. =
 IMMEDIATELY AFTER, ALL K-26 (944 TURBO) K-27, AND K-29'S HAD A REVISED =
SHAFT WITH REVERSED THREAD PITCH.  OTHER SUBTLE IMPROVERMENTS TOWARDS =
PERFORMANCE WERE ALSO PRESENT.

WE URGE YOU DENNIS, TO CONTACT EITHER OF THE TWO OFFICIAL NORTH AMERICAN =
KKK DISTRIBUTORS AND ASK THEM FOR A K-29.  WHAT YOU WILL RECEIVE IS A =
K-29.

KINDLY CALL ME TODAY TO DISCUSS THIS AND PLEASE HAVE YOUR INVOICE TO =
HELP US DETERMINE WHAT HAPPENED, & WHEN, SO THAT WE MAY ASSIST YOU IN =
THIS MATTER.

Best regards,
JIM
