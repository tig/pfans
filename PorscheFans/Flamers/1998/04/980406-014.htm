Dear P Fans,

     Although usually I do not complain about matters when it comes to my
toys, (read that my C2/930 S), I have to admit, at this moment I feel like
shouting so all can hear me.

     Last fall I bought a Turbocharger for my C2 Turbo, was going to have it
installed right away, (an upgrade, not a necessary replacement) and then,
working for the Government, was called away and spent the majority of the
winter months out of country.  I wasn't sure what I wanted to buy, looked at a
few Garretts modified for the C2, and a KKK K-29.   I had done my homework,
gleaned all the knowledge I thought was necessary and then listenedf to what I
assumed was straight talk from a salesman at Windward.   Big Mistake.

     To the point, two weeks ago, I had it installed by a shop in my area who
is known to produce excellent work, and I must admit that I was impressed with
the performance gains in the turbo.   The car has a 1 Bar, boost spring and
has had the fuel system modified for extra fuel under boost conditions.   I
was happy, for about one week.   Last Monday, on the way to my office, during
a snappy shift from 2nd to third, I was alerted that something was wrong when
I heard this loud whirling sound, watched the boost guage go to zero and felt
an immediate loss of power.  Looking into the rear view mirror, I was alarmed
to see clouds of blue smoke trailing out the rear of my baby.  Two hours
later, at my installers garage, I was informed that the Turbo had gone to
Turbo heaven and was a total write-off.

     Asking why, I was informed this was the reason they did not want to sell
me a K-29 in the first place.   Also, they informed me, (I was told that this
turbo had a larger shaft than standard K-29's and reversed (left handed)
threads on the shaft, and would not come apart), that this was not  really a
K-29, as KKK never produced such an animal, and the numbers were the brain
child of somebody in someones marketing dept.   My installer said it was the
same size shaft as a K-27, and the threads on the shaft were right handed.  So
much for the Truth in Sales pitch process.

     I have called Windward three times, and left my name, and phone number,
all three times, and have yet to hear from one of their represenatives.   Is
this their common practice?    Can all their lines, be always busy?   Has
anyone experienced this before?

     I don't want to go off half cocked, but have been warned by several
individuals that this is their standard procedure.   Perhaps someone could
give me some input and let me know their experiences?

Thanks in Advance
