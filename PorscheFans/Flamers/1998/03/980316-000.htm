hey everyone, i haven't posted before, new to the porsche market. 1970 91=
1T
targa,

i have noticed already though some inconsitancies in the porsche retail m=
arket.

1. how come automotion is a consistant 10-25+ dollars more expensive than
say performace?

2. how come the counter people don't seem to know anything about porsches=
?
	ie: they sale me the wrong part, don't know what comes in a
specific kit.

they seem to be suppliers of quality goods, but they don't seem to have
much in the way of customer support. and i would think they would have a
policy of matching prices. all of these parts come from the same supplier=
s
no matter who's retailing it.

does anybody have a reputable parts supplier they could recomend in the b=
ay
area?

i have had awesome experiencies with parts heaven out of hayward.
just my two cents on the deal.

later.
g.
