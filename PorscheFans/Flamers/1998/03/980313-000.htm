I am a recent subscriber to Porshcefans and I have noticed that there are a
number of complaints about shops around the country.  We already know about
Rich Howe but I would like to add Peter Dawe to the list.  He built me a race
motor and as a 3.4/Motec motor, it is competitive with the 2.7 race cars-on a
straight.  Other 3.4s fly by me like I was a 2.7.  He's promised to make
things right but won't even give me a dyno sheet nor will he inform me of what
is inside the darn motor.  I've called him a number of times and left messages
for him to call back and he called back only once and again promised to send
data but nothing has arrived.  The motor cost me 38grand and I now have it at
another shop to find out why it's so slow.    He also built a motor for a
friend of mine and put in a cam that was too big for a 2.7 and when it was
replaced, the car ran very competitively.  My e-mail address is
caretta77@aol.com and I am willing to keep a current list of shops and
mechanics for Porschefans.
