Read your letter about Peter Dawe in Porsche Fans....I forward these post to a
friend in Miami, and this is his response to reading of your problem with
Peter Dawe.  I might mention that this individual knows most of the players in
Miami and has delt with Mr. Howe in one instance...Thought you would like to
hear his response.

 David, 

     just read what Caretta77 had to say about Peter Dawe . . . well, he
should live in Miami . . . we deal with guys like that on a more personal
basis.  If I paid 38 grand to have a motor built, and the guy wouldn't respond
to my phone calls, or tell me what was inside it, then I believe it would be
time for some serious conversation . . . we had one fella down here who worked
that way . . . needless to say, he doesn't work on Porsche's anylonger . . .
He built a motor for one of our more flamboyant Players of the area, and
really took him to the cleaners . . .  not giving him what he paid for and
then ignoring him.   Three weeks later, the guy had a really nasty accident
with a ban saw . . .guess it is hard to build motors with just stubs left on
one hand.   Sometimes there is brutal reality to street justice.   Lawyers and
police don't always do the trick . . . I can't say that I condone this action,
but it will be a long time before someone cheats that  player
again........later guy
                         Dennis

Gee, wonder if this would get Mr. Dawes attention?
