	The relay has nothing to do with the interior light.  If you are
trying to fix this light, then you may need to pull the back panel out of
the car.  This is actually pretty simple; Haynes is not too bad for it.
	If I remember correctly, the dome light always gets +12V.  One of
the ground wires is always grounded, the other is only grounded when one or
the other of the doors are opened.  (Detected by small rubber-covered
switches in the front door jambs.)  The switch on the light itself connects
the lightbulb to one of those two grounds, or none at all.  That gives you
the three options:  Always on, always off, and on when the doors are open.
Take your voltmeter and ohmmeter and start checking...

	The relay under the passsenger seat is for the infamous seatbelt
interlock system.  This is a system that will not allow you to start the
car without the seatbelts fastened.  Happily, when the electrical plugs
coming from the seatbelt receivers are unplugged, you can start the car
with no problems.
	Until the relay gets flakey.
	There are two THICK yellow wires going to the relay.  These are the
wire from the ignition switch to the relay, and from the relay to the star-
ter.  You can permanently connect these two wires together (insulate the
connection, or you'll be sorry!) and the relay will be permanently disabled.

>I seem to remember someone on the list mentioning a turbo kit.

	Turbo kits are often asked about, seldom answered.  From what I
have heard so far, nobody is making the kits anymore.  I have even heard
that one company that was making a supercharger kit is now no longer doing
it.
	The short version is that adding a turbo onto a car that was de-
signed as a normally-aspirated car is NEVER going to be a bolt-on operation,
unless the "turbo kit" is going to be manufactured in the tens of thousands,
or going to cost tens of thousands.
	From some e-mail conversations with him, it sounds as if Mike Roads
has the qualifications and experience to do the job right--at least, he
certainly knows a lot more about turbocharging things than I do.  And it's
going to cost him a LOT of money, and take a LOT of time.  But it will
really be a thing to behold if and when he gets it done!
