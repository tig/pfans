I wasn't intending on attacking you personally, whatever your name really
is. I was speaking in generalities. It is my general impression that most
Porsche people are extremely conservative in the repair and maintainence of
thier cars. They all want to do it "the factory way." Why this is I don't
know. Your post just gave me the oppurtunity to express my opinion. Do not
take what I say personally. Obviously, I dont' know you from Adam. I'm sure
you are extremely talented mechanically and have a full shop with toolboxes
brimming with expensive tools that you've been using for years. I'm not
interested in any kind of contest of skills.
