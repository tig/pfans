	Well, someone around here had asked for some autocross reports
or descriptions.  Since the first event of the year in my area was this
weekend, I figured I'd give it a shot.
	The event wasn't.  I got to CandleCom--uh, 3Stick--uh, the Park
Formerly Known As Candlestick--to find a gaggle of Porsches crowded
around the autoX trailer, with no cones in sight.  It had been clear
when I left home, but by the time I got up to The Park, it was really
cats-dogs-and-buckets.
	When I wandered over to the trailer, I found that everyone was
crammed inside, together with all the equipment.  By 8:30, there were
18 of us all piled together in there.  Since 9 people isn't enough to
work a run session, the event was cancelled.  Too many people saw that
the weather wasn't perfect, and wimped out.  Cowards, all of em!  Darn
rassafrassan-gartenblarten-frammalarten-rammaframmit [end Yosemite Sam
imitation]...  I mean, who's afraid of a couple of feet of standing
water, anyway?
	OK, I'm exaggerating.  It probably wasn't any deeper than 18
inches over the deep half of the lot.
	But that would have made it more exciting, right?  Of course,
we'd have to figure out if we wanted to count cones that floated away
against the driver, and the BFG R1 tires on some peoples cars would
have made their lives VERY exciting...

	Oh well.  Maybe in two more weeks.
