[cc'd to PFans because I realize I wasn't as clear as I should've been.]

>BTW, My brake warning light only flashes at idle when the E Brake is on.

	It's supposed to flash when the e-brake is on.  There's a switch
underneath the handle that is pressed when the handle is down (the brake
is OFF).  Unless that switch is pressed, the light flashes.  There is
also a switch in the master cylinder that is activated when a plunger in
the M/C moves too far in one direction or another.  The plunger is located
in between the two circuits of the dual circuit M/C, so it moves when one
circuit or the other loses pressure.  When that switch is activated, the
light also flashes.
	When you bleed the brakes, you step on the pedal and open a bleed
valve.  That drops the pressure in the one circuit, while the other one
still has full pressure.  The pluger moves, the switch gets set.  From
then until you reset it (it's the kind of switch that stays set until it
is reset), the light will flash any time the ignition is on.
	Early cars (don't know what year) had a switch that didn't have
to be reset--it would switch off when the plunger moved back into its
central rest position.

	So there are two different ways to turn on that flashing red light.

	Make more sense now?
