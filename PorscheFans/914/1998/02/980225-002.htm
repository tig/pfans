Sam,

Sorry to butt in on your question ref carb set-up which I'm sure others
more knowledgeable than I will assist with, however I would like to
comment on your statement re Dual Progressive carbs generally. I ran a
Weber Dual Progressive set up on a 1.7 in a VW Beetle and it ran strong
right through the rev range. It was easy to tune and definitely didn't
run too rich on either side. In search of more power I changed this set
up to dual carbs and although they liberated some top end the difference
in the important ranges was marginal if any. In my layman's terms I
understand the operation of a dual progressive to be essentially as a
"large" single carb which under acceleration allows a second throat to
open increasing the flow of juice/air. Therefore I don't see anything
which in principle says there will be any difference in fuel balance
between cylinders which didn't exist with a single carb? Incidentally
fitting the Weber was a pain as I had to enlarge the openings in the
aluminium intake manifolds to accept the progressive carbs larger
manifold. I ran it with an 009. 

I've seen a few 914's with the Weber Progressive and they seem to run
ok. I think my dual carb set-up was no better than a progressive for
reasons other than the carbs e.g. gearbox, general engine condition etc.
As others I know have moved on to twin Webers/Dellortos etc. and seen
worthwhile gains. I understand the twin Weber 36's run good with
1.7's???
