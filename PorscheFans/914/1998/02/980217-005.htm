I just did my rear brakes yesterday and this is what I found:
Note: Haynes makes no mention to a inner adjuster protective cap that must be
removed to get to the adjuster.  This is a big oversight considering you can't
see what you are doing and the cap uses the same 4mm tool.  I'm sure many
people have tried 'adjusting' the protective cap.
One of my 4mm protective caps was stripped, so I found that a T-27 Torx bit is
slightly larger than the 4mm hex.  Taking the Torx bit on my socket extension,
I lightly tapped (read hammered) the Torx bit into the end of the protective
cap. A quick turn on the ratchet and it came right out.  In fact it worked so
well, I still haven't gotten the cap off of the Torx bit!  Another method I
have heard of using is a 13mm 12point socket.  Apparently it is just the right
size to hammer onto the O.D. of the protective cap and the 12 points will dig
right in.
In both of these cases, you do not have to remove the caliper.

You do, however, have to get a replacement cap (no this is not a dust cap, but
is necessary to keep the inner adjusters from turning).  I got mine from
Automotion for a hefty $10 each (thats with 20% off).  The new ones are
stainless with a 10mm socket head.

A couple more things to note:  The rear pads are indexed and only go in one way
(big hole on top for the large retaining pin).  Also, for the outer adjusters,
do not try to remove the locknut - there is a retaining ring right behind it.
 The adjusting screw is supposed to turn, but not unscrew.  Also, just like
when adjusting valve clearances, check the clearances after the
locknut/protective cap is tightened, as clearances can change when you tighten
them.

Good luck!
