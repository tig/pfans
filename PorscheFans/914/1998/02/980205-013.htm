I think probably all of us can cite horror stories from one part's supplier
or another. I'v purchased from AA, Doc & Cy's, PP, Tweeks, Stoddard's, et.
al. and found that, for the most part, what I ordered came within a few
days and, if not, was told the part was on back order and did I still want
it.

As for a price, sure, some suppliers are higher than others, but it's up to
the buyer to decide what he's going to purchase and where to get it from.

I just hate to see this bashing going round and round. If someone's got a
bitch, keep it to yourself and the supplier! God knows we need all the
suppliers of 914 parts we can find to keep our cars running and looking
good.
