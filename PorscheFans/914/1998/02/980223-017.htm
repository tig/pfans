	There was one other thing that I did last Saturday.  I had
been having trouble unlocking the driver's side door from the outside
with the key.  The whole outer door handle would try to twist upward
and the key wouldn't turn in the lock.  Locking the door was not a
problem.
	So I took my door apart.  Sure enough, the allen screw that
goes into the front of the handle had fallen out.  Happily, it was
still inside the door shell.
	[Get ready for Stupid Dave tricks!!]
	So I tried to put the screw back in.  I'm not sure exactly
how, but I stripped the threads in the hole in the handle.  My theory
is that either the outermost threads were damaged when the screw fell
out and I didn't start the screw in straight--or that I just started
the darn thing at the wrong angle.
	To make matters worse, when I tried to re-tighten the nut
that holds the back of the handle onto the door, I snapped off the
stud.  Ouch.

	Anyone have a couple of door handles for sale?  At this rate,
I will probably need a couple of them.  Dull and scratched is a plus,
'cause it will match the other handle.  Light-blue overspray is not
a minus, for the same reason.
