Hi all, I would like to thank John Dunkle, who has become a very good friend
to me in a short time, for giving me my own web-page. John has done an
excellent job of setting it up. I would like to invite all of the list members
to check it out.The address is http://www.wgss.com/914/ev. 
I have done a major right side longitudinal repair on my 914. These photos are
on my page. If anyone has any questions on any steps of the repair, feel free
to e-mail me.
I plan to include all steps of the buil up. My car will be a steel flared GT
replica, except it will be a 4 cyclinder, for now!

By the way, John and I look foward to meeting as many of you 914ers as
possible at our East Coast Ramble a.k.a. Ed and John's Excellent 914
Adventure.

Regards,
Ed Villela
