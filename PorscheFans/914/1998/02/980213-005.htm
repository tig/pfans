<<It appears that "World 914 Headquarters" can't purchase Porsche parts for

than retail, too bad.  What can you get from this?  Shop around, those parts
retailers who believe they are "preserving the hobby" may charge museum piece
prices for parts you could purchase from any Porsche dealer anywhere in the US
for less.  You may ask yourself if Stoddard, Zim's, GPR or any of the other
nationally advertised parts sellers would transact sales as Ed's purchase from
AA went off.>>

THANK YOU Perry!!
