Ok. I am desperate for a running 914 without repairs needed.

I am offering a gold and jade braclet that has been in my family for some
time. It was appraised at $2000 in July 1976 when gold price was 146.50 per
ounce on the London Gold Market. Gold content weight was appraised at $800
and the 8 jade stones at $150 each for total of $1200 jade content at that
time. Market value is unknown at this time but I estimate about $3000 or better.

This piece of jewelry belongs to my wife. She has consented to my possible
trade or sale if it will keep me happy once again in my 914 world. I gave it
to her in 1974 for our 13th anniversary and only do this at her suggestion
and wish.

It is not for everyone. It is a fine piece of jewelry that any accustomed to
quality will be proud to possess.

Cash wise, I will take a $2500 cashiers check, ship to you by courier and
let you inspect. Money will be held with a guarantee of refund if not
satisfied upon personal jeweler inspection. You pay return courier and
insurance. I have a good possibility for a 914 in my area but owner needs
cash for buying a new home.

914 wise I will trade for $2500 declared value 914 prior to this message if
it is as described in the 1st line of this message about condition. Small
additional cash may be possible up to a $3000 914 for sale as I can sell a
couple of my computer items to make up any difference.

If interested contact me by personal e-mail and we will work from there.
Serious inquires only, please.
Remember, It will be easier to possess than an unwanted 914 is to store.

1970-1976, those were the days my friend, I thought they would never end.....
Damn, was I ever wrong!

Thanks.
