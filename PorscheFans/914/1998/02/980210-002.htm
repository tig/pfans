<< I just snapped my clutch cable.  Any pointer on the replacement?  What
parts do I need?  Do I need anything other than the cable? >>

Brett,

Buy 2 cables, and keep the spare curled up inside the spare tire.  Get a
"boot" for the cable, it fits over the end of the cable housing near the
pulley, and helps keep dirt out.  Many cars don't have the boot.

Buy a new clevis pin/clip.  The clevis pin goes into a small plastic bushing
in the
end of the clutch pedal arm.  This plastic bushing is usually dead.  You can
get a bronze replacement, which also happens to be part of the pedal cluster
bushing kit.  Bronze bushings use OIL for lubrication, not grease.

Don't forget to clean the bushing.

I've included a copy of an old posting of mine, detailing the clutch cable
job.

-------------------
Clutch cables are easy.

1.   buy 2 clutch cables, 1 clevis pin-clip, and 1 new *bronze*
      clevis bushing
2.   buy haynes manual
3.   remove old, replace with new.
4.   adjust clutch for 1/2" play at the pedal
5.   vroom.
6.   Store spare clutch cable curled up inside spare tire
      (Thanks George Hussey)


The haynes manual describes it best, but here it goes, from memory.

1.  remove both 11mm nuts from end of cable at transmission, remove and save
nuts and special "trunion."  Remove cable from pulley.  It's a good idea to
remove and clean the pulley at this time.  Unthread cable and casing from
bracket that holds the pulley.  Undo any cable ties that attach the clutch
cable casing.  The new cable comes with a casing.

2.  Remove rubber pedal covers from clutch & brake pedals.  Snap throttle
pedal back towards the floor by pulling it from the top.  It should "pop"
free.  Remove floor board from inside car using 5mm allen key.  It may help
to remove center console.  Just jiggle the floor board out.

3.  Remove cover plate over center tunnel; the plate is right beside the gas
pedal.  You should be able to see how the clutch cable attaches to the pedal
cluster at this point.  You now need to remove the clevis pin clip by
unclipping the part that goes around the cable end, then pushing the pin
through.  Spraying with penetrating oil like liquid wrench or even WD40 may
help, especially if it's dirty in there.

4.  Pull the cable end out far enough to remove the clevis.  Save this part
for your new cable.  Once the clevis is removed, along with the little tiny
locknut, go back under the car and pull the cable out.

5.  Push new cable in from below.  Greasing the cable first helps a bit.

6.  From inside the car, thread the clevis back in place.  Don't forget the
locknut.  Re-attach to pedal cluster.  Use new clevis clip, and put a new
(tiny) bushing in the end of the clutch pedal shaft.  Grease plastic
bushings, oil bronze ones.  Use an inspection mirror to make sure the clutch
cable didn't get wrapped around the throttle cable, or you're in for a
surprise.

7.  Go back under the car, install cable in pulley, thread through the
clutch fork, blah blah, replace trunnion and both 11mm nuts.  Guess where
freeplay should be for now, don't tighten the nuts quite yet.

8.  Adjust freeplay.  Push pedal down with a finger until you feel the TO
bearing hit the diaphragm spring.  It should feel really soft, then quite
firm.  The distance that you pushed the pedal down is called freeplay.  Set
this distance to 1/2" by adjusting 11mm nuts underneath the car.  When
you're happy with the freeplay, tighten nuts.

9.  Re-attach the gas pedal, "pop" it in place, then quickly test the
clutch.  Feels good?  great.  Start car, make sure you can find all the
gears.  Everything ok?  Excellent.  Turn off engine, finish re-assembling
interior:  cover plate, floor board, pedal covers, console, etc.

10.  It takes longer to read these instructions and try to understand them
than it does to replace a cable.  Your mechanic charges you 1.0hrs.  If you
can do the job in less than 1.5, you're doing great.  Next time, it will
take about 0.75 hrs.
