My 14 is painted, my classic car insurance is on order (final cost
$78/year), and then it's off to the DMV, but I need a couple small
parts.

NEEDED:  1 rubber bushing and 1 nut for windshield wiper shaft (don't
care about chrome cap)
                       and, wiper arm nuts (thin wall) and washers.

I also have FOR FREE (Southern Cal.): '72 Drivers door w/glass and
chrome rockers which need some elbow grease.

For a reasonable price I also have two engine covers with full letters,
one set chrome, one set gold, small chin spoiler stress cracks (but
fill-able), and a lower dash w/vents.

Now that the car is for the most part drive able, I need to make a bit
of room in the garage!

I am looking forward to getting the car fully registered (it has been
over 12 years for the car, over 2 in my possession.  I know my neighbors
will be ecstatic when I can test it elsewhere than my neighborhood!
Funny thing happened on a test drive last Sunday.  I went about 4 blocks
from my house on the back streets and she kept cutting out w/throttle.
Finally, she didn't want to do anything but idle and I actually pushed
her for half a block and then nursed her home.  I figured the fuel
filters were gunked up from the tank.  When I got home I looked for the
obvious and found it (smack self on back of head here); my fuel pressure
regulator (single Weber) was set at 1/2 lb.  A simple twist to 2.5 lb
and she was purring again.  (live and learn)
