	I'm not sure I see why you can't use the 009 with the 1.8's
L-jet FI system.  The L-jet uses the pulses from the regular ignition
points in the distributor, as opposed to the D-jet's use of the special
FI "trigger points" down in the base of the dizzy.
	The main problem with the 009 for L-jet is that the advance
curve will be different from the stock version.  Probably not a really
good thing, though I suppose it's possible...

	Of course we *all* do!   ;^)    [Hiya, Dirk!]   Actually, I know
of a couple of people (well, at least one person!) who use the stock 2.0
distributor with carbs.  I don't know where they get the vaccuum for the
vacc advance and retard, but evidently they are getting it from somewhere.
Maybe they had one of the carbs modified to provide the vacc fitting?
(Hmm, you could tap one for advance, and the other for retard.  Yeah,
that would be overly-complex!!  Neat!)
