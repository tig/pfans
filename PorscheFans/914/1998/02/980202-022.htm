I think that anyone into 914's must come to appreciate the fundamental
laws of supply and demand. It is certainly a wonderful lesson in basic
economics.Everything that you want or need for your car can be had at
virtually any price if you handle the time factor as a very elastic
element of the equation. If you need it tommorrow, Federal Express, you
will be paying top of the line Porsche prices. If you think of something
that you're going to need this year sometime, just wait, watch, read,
and listen... it will probably come across the list, or be in Panorama,
or show up at a swap meet, or be found lying in an old oil drum in the
back yard and thereby available at a very attractive price. Even this
list, which probably represents a high percentage of the hardcore
914'ers only amounts to a few hundred individuals. This is a
micromarket!  Patience is the key to economical enjoyment of this
affliction. Besides, if you got it perfect, what would you do with it
next week?                                                          Jim
