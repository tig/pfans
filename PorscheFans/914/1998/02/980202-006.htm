This is actually very common in VW Bug circles (where you can actually do an
engine swap in 30 minutes). There are even shops that you can rent engines from
- just bring in your car, they'll swap the engine, you go for your smog test,
bring the car back and they will swap it back! I doubt that this is a service
that is posted on their price list since I am sure that this is illegal.

An easier approach is to get a '75 or '76 exhaust with catalytic converter.
Throw it on before going to the smog test. This will cut your emissions by
about half.  This of course assumes that your engine can still pass the visual
part of the inspection, but buys you quite a bit of leeway on the emissions
part!
