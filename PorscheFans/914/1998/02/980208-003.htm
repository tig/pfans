I'm forwarding this to the list, as it concerns an aspect of my 320i brake
caliper conversion TechTip that I did not address originally.

>Dear Sir,
>     Thanks for the article.  Great help.  The bmw brakes work as promised.  I
>follow your directions with just a few modifications.
>
>Even though you don't mention it, the easiest way to machine the calipers to
>break them into there seperate halves.  I know that the manufacturer doesn't
>recommend this, but it is the best way to machine the mounting ears.  The
>manufacturer doesn't even have the two squared shouldered o-rings in there
>rebuildkits.  But these are readily available from a seal supplier.
>
>When my machinist and I had the calipers apart, we noticed that the
>thicknesses on the two mounting points were not the same.  If we had used
>these for our clamping places for machining the opposite mount, the removal of
>material and machined thickness of the two mounts would have been different.
>
>We decided to use the center half as our clamping point.  This allowed us to
>do two things.  One we could machine both mounting locations with one setup
>and two the mounting locations would both be machined to the exact parrallel
>of the center line of the caliper.  This setup also saved on time because we
>did not have to change the setup to machine the opposite mountine surface.
>
>I have some pictures that I can scan if you would like to see how we did the
>set up.  I am using the brakes on my car now and they work really well.  Your
>other tips in the article were also very helpful.  Thanks again.
