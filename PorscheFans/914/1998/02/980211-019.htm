Are those fiberglass bumpers the same as GT bumpers?
I'm assuming that they're not repos of the big later
bumpers, but instead the early little ones. When I
turned my 914 into a GT look-a-like, we put on the two
piece bumpers with the cut out for an oil cooler. We got
them from a guy named Wigglesworth, and they were molds
taken off his Daytona winning 914 GT, they were well made 
and looked great but were a real bitch to get on. We had to
graft about an inch to each end to get them to fit the 
front of the car. Personally I really like them, I saved
probably close to 100 pounds getting rid of the '75 bumpers,
plus the bumpers look 'right' on the car. I don't know prices
off hand but are they, at $190, competitivly priced with
companies such as AIR or GT?
