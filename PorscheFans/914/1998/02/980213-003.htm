In the 2/5/98 914 P fans list George Hussy wrote

You all have our 914 catalog the 1.7 intake  boots are listed at 10.00

each and have been the same price for at least eight years.  Maybe too

much, but the price is very plain and obvious. As you know your order

took awhile as we had a hard  time getting this last batch and price

suffered by purchasing them from Porsche and having to pay 5.60 each! 

After doing some checking around, I discovered the following pricing
information regarding these boots.

AA's NEW catalog   	$6.00
Stoddard				$5.60
Zim's					$5.60
GPR					$5.20

It appears that "World 914 Headquarters" can't purchase Porsche parts for less
than retail, too bad.  What can you get from this?  Shop around, those parts
retailers who believe they are "preserving the hobby" may charge museum piece
prices for parts you could purchase from any Porsche dealer anywhere in the US
for less.  You may ask yourself if Stoddard, Zim's, GPR or any of the other
nationally advertised parts sellers would transact sales as Ed's purchase from
AA went off.

PS, I sell these parts for $5.20 too
