	If I recall (not a sure thing by any means!), the Zone 7 rules for
B-production state that you can go to 5.5" + 0.5", or a 6" rim.

	It might make sense for them to use the same set of rules, but they
don't.  As a matter of fact, there are many different rulesets in PCA
driving events.  (Purists will tell you that most of them aren't really
"racing"--and that's what we tell the insurance companies!)  PCA Zone 7
uses a fairly unique set of rules, which are different from those used in
Zone 8, which are different from those used at the PCA National competition,
which are different from those used for Club Racing, which are different
from those used by the SCCA.
	All these groups have different needs to meet, and all have struc-
tured their rules to meet their particular needs.  That can make it tough
to have a car that is competitive in more than one venue, but that's the
way it goes.
