Hi Guys,
I have a question for all you 914 wizards out there.
I recently took the "Porterfields" off my 2.0L, in order to preserve my
sanity while driving it on the street (my blazer is getting an eng.
transplant). I'm having problems keeping air out of the brake system. I
bleed the brakes after switching pads and the pedal was good and firm for
about two weeks but then stated traveling further and further towards the
floor. I bleed the brakes and got air out of the RR,LR,and RF none in the
Left Front that I could tell. Again the pedal was firm for about 5 or 6
days before it started towards the floor. I'm not loosing any fluid and
I'm running 6 month old "Motul" Dot 4. I've never had any problems with
the brakes before now.

HELP!!!

FYI- If anyone tells you that running anti-squeal pads on Porterfields
will quiet them down for the street they are WRONG. They will work until
you heat up the brakes 1 time and then you get your pedal feel and the
noise back. My anti-squeal shims lasted exactly 1 lap at Hallett. Don't
get me wrong, the porterfields are quiet as long as they are hot and boy
do they stop. But definitely not for the street.

Thanks for the Info
Pat Morton
