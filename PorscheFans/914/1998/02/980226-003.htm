Let me say, first of all that I don't profess to know squat!!  What I based my opinion
on is how my plugs looked, and my understanding on how progressive carburetors work.



My plugs, when I had the progressive carb mounted were not consistent.  Some were
a nice red/brown color, and others were black and powdery.  So I assumed that I had
some inconsistencies of fuel delivery.  Also, the way my intake setup works, is that
the carb mounts to an aluminum manifold that divides immediately into two, and then
divides again into 4 tubes, and then to each intake.  So with a two barrel carburetor
bolted on, one venturi is positioned primarily over two of the four cylinders.  



Now with a progressive carb, the primary venturi is usually open.  At WOT, the secondary
is opened up, however the secondary is jetted to provide more gas than the primary
 (I think it is a 60:40 ratio??).   This led me to believe that one venturi is going
to be delivering more fuel than the other.  



The Rochester 2G is basically a (BIG) two barrel carb that is symmetrical.   I've
bolted it on, and drove it around a little bit.  It runs OK, but I can already see
the effects of venturies that are too big.  The low end torque is kind of weak, but
the high end has really opened up.    



In any case, it was a fun experiment, cost me nothing, and I learned a lot.  If it
really doesn't work out, I've got my old carb to fall back on.  And hopefully next
year, I'll scrap the whole lot and get a programmable FI.
