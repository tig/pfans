Here is the story I got that was probably created by someone with an
imagination, but no children.

>"Is There a Santa"
>
>
>1) No known species of reindeer can fly. BUT there are
>300,000 species of living organisms yet to be classified,
>and while most of these are insects and germs, this
>does not COMPLETELY rule out flying reindeer, which
>only Santa has ever seen.
>
>2) There are 2 billion children (persons under 18) in
>the world. BUT because Santa doesn't (appear to) handle
>the Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, and Buddhist children, that
>reduces the workload to 15% of the total -- 378 million
>according to Population Reference Bureau. At an average
>(census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that's
>91.8 million homes. One presumes there's at least one
>good child in each.
>
>3) Santa has 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks
>to the different time zones and the rotation of the
>earth, assuming he travels east to west (which seems
>logical). This works out to 822.6 visits per second.
>This is to say that for each Christian household with
>good children, Santa has 1/1000th of a second to park,
>hop out of the sleigh, jump down the chimney, fill the
>stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the
>tree, eat whatever snacks have been left, get back up
>the chimney, get back into the sleigh and move on to
>the next house. Assuming that each of these 91.8 million
>stops are evenly distributed around the earth (which,
>of course, we know to be false but for the purposes
>of our calculations we will accept), we are now talking
>about .78 miles per household, a total trip of 75-1/2
>million miles, not counting stops to do what most of
>us must do at least once every 31 hours, plus feeding,
>etc.
>
>This means that Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles
>per second, 3,000 times the speed of sound. For purposes
>of comparison, the fastest man-made vehicle on earth,
>the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles
>per second -- a conventional reindeer can run, tops,
>15 miles per hour.
>
>4) The payload on the sleigh adds another interesting
>element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more
>than a medium-sized Lego set (2 pounds), the sleigh
>is carrying 321,300 tons, not counting Santa, who is
>invariably described as overweight. On land, conventional
>reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting
>that "flying reindeer" (see point #1) could pull TEN
>TIMES the normal amount, we cannot do the job with eight,
>or even nine. We need 214,200 reindeer. This increases
>the payload -- not even counting the weight of the sleigh
>-- to 353,430 tons. Again, for comparison -- this is
>four times the weight of Elizabeth Taylor.
>
>5) 353,000 tons travelling at 650 miles per second creates
>enormous air resistance -- this will heat the reindeer
>up in the same fashion as spacecrafts re-entering the
>earth's atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer will absorb
>14.3 QUINTILLION joules of energy. Per second. Each.
>In short, they will burst into flame almost instantaneously,
>exposing the reindeer behind them, and create deafening
>sonic booms in their wake. The entire reindeer team
>will be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second.
>Santa, meanwhile, will be subjected to centrifugal forces
>17,500.06 times greater than gravity. A 250-pound Santa
>(which seems ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the
>back of his sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force.
>
>In conclusion: If Santa ever DID deliver presents on
>Christmas Eve, he's dead now.
