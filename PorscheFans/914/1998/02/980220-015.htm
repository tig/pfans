Well I guess if it makes you happy, go ahead and use a sealant on these plugs,
which I've never had leak, but hey it's your car do whatever you want.  (even
a V8 engine if that makes you happy)  My experience only goes to the 8-12
914's I've owned.  The extra slick teflon may also allow you to possibly over
torque these plugs as well.  I just don't want to use something I don't need,
or borrow trouble.  If you've ever done any actual plumbing you'll remember
upon dissassembly that the teflon tape is usually very shredded and difficult
to completely remove.  Aircraft sealant however, comes off easily with solvent


The problem I have with using teflon tape on anything near my engine
lubrication system, (oil lines, drain plugs, etc) is I really don't want to
find out how small a scrap of teflon tape it takes to plug up a piston
squirter, or the pin holes in the cam spray bar.


>>It is my general impression that most Porsche people are extremely
conservative in the repair and maintainence of thier cars. They all want to do
it "the factory way." Why this is I don't know.

Last November I was fortunate enough to attend the Porsche President's Meeting
which included an extensive tour of Porsche's Weissach (vi-sock) research and
test facility, in addition to the assembly plant in Zuffenhausen, and the
offices in Luwigsburg.  This was a once in a lifetime experience, as the
general public is not allowed to tour all of these facilities.  After seeing
what, how, and why Porsche builds their cars I too, prefer to do things "the
factory way".  Perhaps after I win the lottery I can have a test facility
where I can abuse and crash cars, abuse and blow up engines, and test every
other part that Porsche puts on the cars.  Until then I'll entrust my
mechanical technique to as close as I can to "the factory way", but then again
this is just my opinion.  Ask Bruce Anderson, Bob Garretson, or Alan Caldwell
what their opinion on "the factory way" may be.


no cute quotes, but lots of cars, lots of parts, a few busted knuckles, and oh
yea a "few expensive tools" too
