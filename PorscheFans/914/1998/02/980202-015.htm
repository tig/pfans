I use a 1/4" drive, 4mm allen key with an extension.  You reach through the
hole in the control arm and remove the cover plug.  The adjuster is 4mm
allen, but turned "backwards" relative to the outer adjuster.  When removing
your tool, make sure you don't accidentally pull out the inner adjuster.
It's not held in place by anything except the cover plug.  There is a spline
(er, gear??) on the inner end of the adjuster that actually turns the
adjuster mechanism, hence the "backwards turning."

When you re-install the cover plug, use a bit of never-seize.  I also
install a copper sealing washer under the plug, for easier removal next
time.  If your plugs are mangled, you can get replacements from VW, off the
end of a rabbit/golf/jetta head or oil filter housing.   It's basically a
metric oil sender plug.  Get a copper washer too.

The same 1/4" drive, 4mm allen key is useful for tightening shift linkage
screws too.  Get a good one (NOT ball-end) from Mac or Snap-On, $10.
