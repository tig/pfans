Hello Pat, and 914'ers

I've got an engine stand that works with V8's and I can tell you
that the stand itself will support the load, but the V8 attachment
part wont attach to the 914 engine case.
I made my own engine attachment for the 914 case by assembling
a few bits from my collection of steel.  I used about a foot and a half
of 3/4 to 1" square bar stock, about three feet of 1" black steel gas pipe,
a 4" square 1/4" steel plate, and a foot long chunk of heavy wall
2.5" diameter steel pipe (for the engine stand receiver).
 -and a few bits of 14 ga. steel sheet as braces.

Oddly enough, the diameter of a disc brake rotor off a '77 Olds Cutlass
or other GM product is just the inside lip diameter of the 914 engine case.
(all displacement sizes)
Take a torch and heat the square bar stock to red and form it over the
outer edge of the disc brake rotor, be sure to get the ends tight to the
rotor contour.  Optional:  measure the diameter/length of 1/2 of a 914
case and cut the bar stock to length prior to heat and bend.
Once you get the bar to fit the engine case, locate and drill the holes
for mounting it to the case.  (mount the case half that has the distributor
on it)
Next, cut the black gas pipe into 1 foot chunks, and heat them to red
and beat them into a curve.  Make each of the three hunks the same curve.
Then weld the curved chunks to the curved bar stock, placing one pipe
at each end of the bar and one in the middle. (dont cover the mount holes)
When welding these curved bits of pipe, orient the ends toward the center
of the engine case, like make the ends collect where the crankshaft would
extend out the end of the case.
Use a cutting torch to cut a hole in the 4" plate to allow the thick-wall 
2.5"
pipe to pass thru, and weld the pipe into the plate on both sides of the 
plate.
(this will greatly increase the load capacity of the engine holder and make
it safer if a poor weld occurs)
Take the 4" square plate and hold it against the curved pipe ends, correct
the alignment by pounding the tubes to fit the plate flush, then weld the
pipes to the plate.  Add a few bits of 14 ga sheet steel to the 
pipe/plate/bar
interfaces to buttress the tubes to the plate and curved bar (further
increasing load strength)
You should now have a P92xx 914 engine case mount for use in a V8 style
engine stand, I suppose you could butcher the insert that comes with the
original stand and make it a 914-only tool, but I chose to fabricate my own
from scratch and keep the original stand as useable for any application.
The only thing remaining is drilling holes in the main support tube so that
you can rotate and fix the position of the engine case while you work on it.
I leave that as an option.

Assuming you complete this task, You will now have paid for your
gas welding rig because the cost of the 914 engine stand mount is
roughly the same as a moderate size gas welding rig (minus cylinders).

 -How did I figure out that a disc brake rotor was just the right size. . ?
Dumb Luck.  I had a '77 cutlass junk rotors laying around, I used one
as a base for a grinding stand I built and I had the second laying around. .
