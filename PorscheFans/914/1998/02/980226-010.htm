I'm using the original '74 901 transmission right now. It's held up for 3,500
miles so far. I'm using a lightweight flywheel manufactored by Patrick
Motorsport's in Phoenix, AZ. Its 6.85 pounds and has the "teeth" notched in the
edge of it for the DME speed sensor. Some minor fitting is required to the
speedsensor so that the gap is correct between the sensor and flywheel.

I'm also using the Patrick Motorsport engine mount bar, so the shift linkage
clears the engine no problem. However, the shift linkage, with the factory bend,
does not clear the 1.75" 914/6 headers. If you're familiar with the construction
of the shift linkage, you'll recall there are two "set-screws"(?) at each end that
hold it in place. The clear the headers the bar simply need to be rotated down
(about 30 degrees) so I drilled another hole in the bar so the set screw now
enters at 30 degrees from original. I can't tell a difference from the factory
set-up.

Other than that, everything is stock except for solid transmission mounts. The
plan is to install a 915 or G50 when the time/money arrives, but 901's are cheap.

Yes, it passed emissions no problem and is my daily driver.
