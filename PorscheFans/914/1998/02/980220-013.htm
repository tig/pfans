Guys, 

What the crush ring does is act as lock washer that keeps the door closed.

One time , I did not install it on an oil change on my 944, I got close to
25 miles before I dropped the plug & and all oil.

"Put in the crush ring", voice of experience speaking

	Regards,

Dan

	I'm certainly not one of those "Gotta do it the factory way or else
	types". But the fact of it is, once that piece of teflon tape gets
	loose, one can only hope that the strainer (if you have one) catches
it.
	It's not a sure fire thing that the teflon will find itself trapped
by
	the strainer, or even go in that direction.

	By the way, I don't have a strainer now, the extended oil trap makes
	installing a strainer problematic. Yes, others have done it with
their
	traps, but I tried for while to figure out how I could keep the
strainer
	on mine and couldn't find a simple solution. The new engine
(someday)
	will have a strainer, but it'll also have a canton-meca oil filter
and a
	deep sump.
