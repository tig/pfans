    No, Chip... There are two types of brake fade, neither of which
    will decrease the brake-pedal travel:

    1.  Pad fade:  Each brake-pad compound is designed to
        operate in a specific temperature range.  If you're using
        low-temp pads and you overheat them, or if you're using
        high-temp pads (the classic example is the Ferodo DS11) and
        you don't heat them ENOUGH, your car won't stop, but the
        brake pedal will feel exactly the same (and travel the same
        distance) as it always did.

    2.  Fluid fade:  If enough heat is transmitted through the
        pad and caliper to boil the brake fluid, you'll get bubbles
        in the brake lines which will compress when you press on the
        pedal. This will make the pedal feel "spongy" and you'll
        have to press it FURTHER than usual in order to get the same
        braking action as before the fluid boiled.

        In many cases, the pedal will go all the way to the floor,
        "leading," as Carroll Smith says, "to frantic pumping of
        both the brake pedal and the driver's heart."
