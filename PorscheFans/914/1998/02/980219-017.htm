I have the opportunity to buy a real 1970 914-6 and am wondering what it
is worth.  I'm torn with the decision to buy because I'd have to sell my
74 2.0 and I've got a LOT of sweat, money, blood, and memories in that
one already (don't we all).

Here's the info on the 6:
It has the original 2.0 motor (rebuilt 1500 miles - S pistons, T cams,
no carbs).  Side-shifter tranny (obviously a later-model replacement).
The car is 100% rust free (minor battery tray rust has been properly
repaired) NO body damage.  All mechanicals are there and in good shape.
The car is primered and ready for final sanding and paint.  No interior,
no rubber, but has all glass.  Originally straight-fendered, but was cut
and had original GT steel flares welded on 10 years ago (my personal
preference is straight fenders, but what can you do).  15x7, 15x8
black-centered Fuchs.

What do you all think?  How much should I pay for this car?  Could I get
$4500 for my 74 2.0 (VG condition - 150psi on all 4 pistons, FI, Fuchs,
great interior, body needs paint)?

Thanks for any and all musings on this one.
