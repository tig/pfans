	Took some time out last night to work on the car.  I replaced all
the fuel hoses on the top side of the engine (waiting until the tank is
almost empty to replace the ones under the car), I swapped out the Filko
injectors for my freshly-refurbished ones from Pacific Fuel Injection,
and I changed the spark plugs.
	The old ones came out black and powdery.  Yech.  OK, so I have
myself a rich-running car.  I kinda figured that with the gas mileage I
was getting.  I've tweaked the mixture leaner (head temp sensor pot),
but the car is bucking a little worse now at low RPMs.   8^(   I'll try
unplugging the throttle switch, but I'm pretty sure that's not the cul-
prit.  Sigh!  More chasing to do.  Maybe I really *will* go get an O2
sensor permanently installed in the car.
	I also put some electrical tape over the extra connectors in my
head temp sensor circuit.  I just want to be sure that the metal parts
of the connectors can't touch bare metal (GROUND!) anywhere.
	I hope I can get the car running a little better before Saturday.
The first AutoX is Saturday at CandleCom... Uh, 3Stick... Uh, The Park
Formerly Known As Candlestick.  Say, anybody know a way to properly
mount a mast and sail onto a 914?  I may need it if the weather doesn't
improve by Saturday.    B^P

	Three indicators that the California rain situation is serious:
1)  No Bay Area highway is open for its whole length.
2)  Gov. Wilson delcares an official emergency.
3)  Dave drives his 914 with the roof on.
