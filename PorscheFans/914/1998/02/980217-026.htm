Having just had a problem with acc.cable binding, I noticed that there
are at least three distinct models of cables:
- The German GEMO brand has a white (Teflon?) section in the tunnel
(around the cable) 4.5mm OD and an ID at least twice the thickness of
the inner cable,
- Another (unknown manufacturer) has a 3.5mm OD white section and an ID
about half of the 4.5mm cable's white section ID, and
- The TerryCable which has no white liner, but does have larger cable
strands than the other two.  (I haven't tried the TerryCable yet, but my
first impression is that it may be more difficult to feed into the
tunnel.)

It was the 3.5mm cable that developed the bind (a graunch sound like
metal on metal when depressing the pedal, silent when releasing, and
VERY high pressure required).

I've also noticed that the tube through the firewall in my 914 is either
curved (or corroded or something) to the extent that I can only feed a
new cable through if I first cut off 1/4" or so of the threaded end that
will go to the screw-on ball connector.

QUESTIONS OF THE LIST:
How important is having a white section in the tunnel?
How important is the fineness or coarseness of the strands in the cable?

I've never lubed the cables with anything - are there any lubes that
won't attract dust or cause other problems (graphite, maybe)?
What have your experiences been with acc.cables?
How long is that guide tube in the tunnel?
