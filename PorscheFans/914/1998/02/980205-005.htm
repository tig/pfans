Another option is if you paid with a credit card and they try giving you AA
credit you could dispute the charge on the credit card.

Just an option to consider since I don't know all the details on both sides
of this one.  My experience with AA is limited to one tiny order which I
got with no problems other than a delay due to UPS strike.

Hello Ed and teener's,
I can tell you what else you will learn, since I have been right where
you are and spoke to George myself , but guess I didnt get him on a good
day, but mine wasnt about money, just additude....
You WILL get the 100% refund, but in AA CREDIT, not Green!
Have fun spending that one, guess you'll have tp buy something else to
use up your AA credit ;   )
Later,
 Don
Btw; No Sorry needed, except maybe for the 3 or 4, George fans on the
list.

We'll
