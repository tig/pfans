You're giving us Buckeyes way too much credit, John. A couple of us 914
owners in the Mid-Ohio region just said what the heck, lets get a bunch of
other 914 owners together and swap stories and maybe learn something
between us. I'm as close as you get to a co-ordinator for this bunch, and
anybody who knows me knows how far that goes! Everybody with an interest
is welcome, but I would appreciate some advance notice so nobody gets left
out on the food. One of our members, Dave Wenger is giving us the use of
his shop for this event. We are doing a clutch replacement for this event. 

If there is enough interest, I would be willing to make this a more or
less regular event. I thought about getting into rustoration next month.
My '73 already has the engine out awaiting some panel replacement so I
have the candidate for the event. Anybody who is considering this job on
their car might want to see what they're getting into there.
