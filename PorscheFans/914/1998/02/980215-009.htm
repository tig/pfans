Well, the time finally arrived; my 914 is on the road, legally!  I had
an interesting afternoon getting the final registration done.  I bought
my final chassis about 2 years ago.  The car had been sitting in a
backyard (love those black widows) and had not been registered in some
time.  The last record of registration I found in the car was from
1979-1980.  Needless to say, the car was no longer on file with the CA
DMV.

To make a long story short, I waited until 1998 to finalize the
registration partially due to SB42.  By past paperwork though, it looked
like I would still have to have a headlight inspection and VIN numbers
verified.  After poking my head in the DMV and seeing the line that went
to the door, I decided to go to AAA and see if this was within there
services.  I turns out AAA can do the VIN inspection, and the headlight
inspection was unnecessary since the car was not a salvage (good thing
too, I was worried about my shaved front side markers).  So far, so
good.

So I got the temporary sticker, went home, and brought the car back to
AAA.  By the way, this was the longest drive the car had been on in many
years.  Here is the fun part.  Getting the VINs verified turned out to
be a two hour ordeal.  I thing I remember someone on the board with a
similar story.  All of my paperwork said "Porsche" and the VIN on the
paperwork matched the car plates.  Of course, the car says Volkswagen AG
on all of the plates!  I tried to explain the relationship with the guy
from AAA, but he kept saying things like "I've never heard of a Porsche
being a Volkswagen" and "this must be some sort of a kit built car" and
"It should say Volkswagen on the papers" and "all of the Porsches I have
seen are really round"...  I really couldn't think of anything to say to
convince him that the car was sold and marketed in the U.S. as a
Porsche.

So we went inside and he said he could check it out by the VIN
sequence.  He had calls into the CHP, and looked in all the books he
could find, but couldn't find the one with VINs.  He went as far as to
look at the plates on someone's 912 that worked there and of course they
didn't look anything like mine and said Porsche all over them.

In one last effort, I had him go back to my car.  I found the 1979-1980
registration in my glovebox!  That was a start.  Then I found the
sticker on the gas tank top tank which says Porsche-Volkswagon.  "Oh, I
guess there is some sort of relationship" I heard and from that, he
agreed to finish my registration.

So, I am registered and on the road.  I drove around today working out
some bugs including a throttle that would not close all the way all of
the time and some carb (sorry purists) adjustments.  The car is running
outstanding except for on thing (and I afraid this is a big thing).  On
long decels, she's smoking.  I am using a used 2.0 and don't know the
history.  The only cause I can think of right now is a loose valve guide
that is sucking oil.  I will pull the plugs before I run the car again
to see if I can isolate the cylinder.  Regardless, the car runs great.
