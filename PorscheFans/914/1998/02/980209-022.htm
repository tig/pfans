Oh no! Don't do it. This is a common VW thing to do. And although it can
be effective, it is not the way to go about solving the problem. The MPS
you bought was designed to work with your engine. Furthermore, it's
brand new and is still under warrantee. Just return it for an exchange.
If you pull that plug, the warrantee is null and void and any potential
damage that ensues from his farting around with the MPS bias screw will
be coming out of your already depleted bank account.

Adjusting this screw simply adjusts the bias of the MPS. What it will do
is effectively lean out or richen the mixture across the rpm band.
Unlike the idle adjustment screw which only adjusts idle mixture. A
similar effect can be had by placing a pot in line with the HTS, but a
pot is not something that is available as a tewak from the factory, so
it's not something that everybody is going to think of. The MPS on the
other hand has that screw, and it is often tweaked.
