What Next.
As an addition to my 'floorpan swap' tech article,
I neglected to mention you should treat the finished
parts with a primer of choice, but since this is just a
floorpan, you dont necessarily need to paint it with
factory colors.  You do want to coat it with something
to prevent rust.  Originally, the pan has just
primer and color and undercoat (in that order) on the
underside of the car.  Inside the car, it is much the
same with one major exception: soundproofing.

The factory applied a thick bituminous sheet to the
interior surface of the pan.  This material is available
and I highly recommend it.  'Wurth' sells it in packets
of I think, six self adhesive sheets. . .horrendously
expensive.  A domestic alternative is marketed by
'Evercoat' which can be had at your local friendly
local automotive paint supplier at a significantly
lower cost, but still expensive.  It comes in two
thicknesses.  I use the thicker stuff, because the
cockpit of a 914 is noisy enough; the thicker, the
greater the noise attenuation.

The Evercoat stuff comes in roughly 12 inch sq. sheets,
which means you will have to tailor and tile it in.  This is a
job best done in the sun on a warm day. . .maybe
a HOT day so the stuff gets soft and pliable, after all
it is made of TAR (thus the 'bituminous' term) and
guess what tar does when its warm.  The pan has
a lot of contours to follow, and that means pushing
it in with your fingers or thumbs, or using a
selection of brayers to roll it down.  A heat gun can
substitute for a warm and sunny day, but you get
into problems with warming a full sheet of this stuff.
Anyway, each sheet has a peel off backing and the
trick is to position it ONCE, then stretch it into the
contours while it is warm.  If you tear it, it can be
patched.

Get it too hot and it melts.  Try to work with it too
cold and it breaks.  You cut this stuff with a stout
scissors, or a knife (an X-Acto works great) and
it can be softened enough that small chunks can
be layed in and press the seams together to make
it look like one continuous sheet. . .Yeah it's crude,
but effective and a lot cheaper than buying the
factory sheeting (if it is still available).
This stuff is also sold by high-end stereo outlets
like Crutchfield, known by some trade name, but
its basically the same sound deadener sheeting.

This covering could also be used as a substitute in
place of the rubberized sheeting on the rear firewall
interior, but the caveat here is that in event of
extreme operating temperatures, the adhesive may
fail, or the bituminous could melt and sag.

Once you have this material in place, you can
proceed to paint it like any other surface, but
the coatings may need to set a bit longer while
the volatile solvents evaporate.
