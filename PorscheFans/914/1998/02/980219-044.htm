Dave,

My distributor shaft had enough wear that it was impossible to maintain =
timing with the stock ignition setup. After replacing the points with =
the Allison/Crane unit, this big problem went away. I don't doubt that =
shaft wobble if severe could affect the timing, but this unit is far =
less sensitive to it than the points were, and I haven't had problems =
with timing since switching.

> If I remember, both the latter two options have similar prices.
