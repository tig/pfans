Brian,
Basically I did what was requested. I used a 1/16th to "find" the nuts on the
outside, drilled and whammo! No problem. I realized that one of the mirrors I
got has a part number stamped into it. (too dark to see now). This is the
mirror with the dent in it. I'll replace it whan I find a good cheap one. I
did get the good one at the boneyard. Pulled it myself off a door in a pile of
914 and bug doors out around the house in the mud. When I brought it in to the
main shed to pay, the guy looked at it and said, "where did you get this!
These are rare--a passenger side?" (It was actually a driver side flipped a
bit around do to my removal tactics. I asked, "how much?", dreading the answer
after his remark. "Well, I'll have to ask Brian. This is no $10 rabbit
mirror." Oh No, I thought. I am about to be shellacked over a clean,chrome
mirror I don't really need. Then here comes Brian. The word of truth. He takes
one look at it and says," The drivers side ones are the rare ones. Gimme 15
bucks"
 Done Deal.
