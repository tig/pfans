I dug into my '74 L-jet ECU a long time ago - probably can't find my notes
anymore. These ECU's are pretty basic analog computers - state-of-the-art
late 60's technology. The op-amps used are probably hopelessly unobtainable
now a days if you need to replace one, but once you understand the theory
of op-amps, they probably won't be hard to cobble up a suitable
replacement. What you are saying is correct: vary the resistor = vary the
output - to a point. At some point the output of an op-amp goes into
saturation and you just can't get no mo' out of it. I'd spend more time on
this, but I'm in the middle of a little inner rocker restoration project
right now.  I think Stephen Jacobs was working on a replacement design -
haven't heard anything from him in a while. My last attempt to e-mail him
bounced.
