Guys,

Just for fun, the next time you're at a Mailboxes, Etc. (or similar 
shipping chain-store), check the prices of boxes...say for example, a 48" 
x 6" x 6" box (swaybar size).  You will be unpleasantly surprised. 

Granted, parts businesses buy theirs in bulk, but they still aren't 
cheap...and this is just one component out of maybe a half dozen cost 
factors which go into getting the part to your door - unbroken and in a 
timely manner.

I think we (as a culture) may be losing sight of the fact that just a few 
years back, NOTHING was deliverable in a matter of hours or days...weeks 
was the norm.  Just in time delivery is a fairly new concept at all 
levels, and it has its costs.
