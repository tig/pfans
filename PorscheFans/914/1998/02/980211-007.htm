Remember the basis of the Solo II rules. If it doesn't say that you
_can_ do it, then you can't. Does the factory manual stipulate anywhere
the changing of the cam timing? And as for power gains? Yes, a power
gain can be had by changing the cam timing, but it's really nothing more
than moving the power band around. You're not really gaining anything,
you're trading off somewhere, and in autox, the last thing you want to
sacrifice is bottom end power. 

And stock valve sizes for a 2.0L are 42mm intake and 36mm exhaust.
