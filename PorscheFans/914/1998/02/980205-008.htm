(Outer longitudinal replacement Prt 2 of 2)

Now that you have the logitudinal (or section) off
you must prepare the car for the new part or section.
It is advisable to take account of the condition of the
inside of the car's clamshell. This is your golden
opportunity to peer where no man/woman should
ever see, but all 914'ers wish they could before
they buy the car. .   You can also treat these surfaces
to a rust kill coating of your choice, but I dont trust
a slathering without a prior cleaning to bare metal.
This will allow you to know for sure if there is any
rust thinning of the structures, and if they need to
be replaced.  Sandblasting works great, , but
has its tradeoffs, scotchbrite wheels are fine
provided you can get it in there.

The goal here is to get everything as clean as possible
for the rustproofing and welding process.
A weld-thru coating, zinc paint or POR-15, etc is fine,
but clean that stuff away from actual weld sites because
they will contaminate a MIG weld.  Furthermore, these
coatings can burn from the heat of  welding and can
cause a 'flash' fire, or smoke and contaminate your
MIG weld or worse, set fire to the warm air tube within
the longi and stink up your car.

On the car, every place where a you cut a spotweld
must now be transcribed and drilled into the new longi's
flange to act as pseudo-spot welds (rosettes).  This could
be upward of 40 spots, er holes.  Or you can skip drilling
and use a luggable spotwelder, but these are notoriously
bulky due to the transformer needed to generate the weld
current.  Either way, you need to grind the leftover spotweld
pellets down flush with the panel or flange so the surfaces
can fit flat against each other.  Once all this arduous task
is complete, you will need to clamp the clamshells together
to check fitment.  Dont forget the warm air hose bracket.
If all is well, then you are ready to tack weld the clamshell
back together.  Use a wet rag to cool the weld sites and
minimize burning and warpage.  Keep a fire extinguisher
handy too.

Alternate the tack welds as if you were torquing the bolts
on a head.  When the longi is re-attached and all spot welds
or holes are rosette'd it is time to grind the welds back to flush
with the flange so the threshold plate can be reattached.
Use a similar method to re-attach the threshold plate,
depending on how well things fit back together, you can
start by brazing the ends back on, or spot-rosette the
plate and brackets, use clamps or weights to force the
plate into position.  You dont need to drill holes in the
threshold plate because the spotweld cutter already
has done that, but you will need to clean away any coatings
from around the holes where you are going to MIG rosette.

Dont try to MIG a site where braze is or you will get a
surprise.  Brass and zinc burn at the temperatures a MIG
generates, and creates nasty fumes you dont want to inhale.
Your only options are to totally clean (grind or sand) the metal
joints free of all braze and attempt a MIG, or oxyweld.
Braze is very difficult to remove completely, and MIG is rather
unforgiving in this respect.

That is all I can think of for now.
Um, I think I will follow up with an expose' of how to make
curved patches and perhaps how to replace sail panels.
I patched around 35 spots on my '73 car, including wheelwells,
trunk resection, door panels, pedal box and headlight buckets,
clutch tubes, and the dreaded suspension console. .
