	I have one of those oil traps on my engine, to help keep the
oil light off in turns.  As you may know, this eliminates the stock
sump screen.
	This has aggravated a situation that has always annoyed me--
the fact that you don't get enough copper crush washers with your
"oil change gasket kit".
	The kits that you get from GPR contain two paper gaskets for
the sump screen, and one copper washer.  That's one gasket between the
screen and the case, one between the cover and the screen, and the
washer for the sump cover nut.  The ones I get locally contain FOUR
paper gaskets, and two washers.  They evidently don't expect you to
use a washer on the oil drain plug.  But I do use one.
	Since I don't have the sump screen, I only need one of the
paper washers every oil change--to go between the oil trap and the
engine case.  That leaves me with three unused gaskets per oil
change, and a couple of bucks extra spent on the gasket kits.  I
dislike that kind of waste.
	Happily, the folks at Global Metrics have come through again.
I went in with one of the washers, and was able to pick up a bunch
of them.  If you buy in quantity (I got 100), they're less than a
quarter apiece.  So now I can use the $2.50 gasket kit, plus three
25-cent washers, for two oil changes.  And have no extra gaskets
left over.
	Now *that* doesn't annoy me.
