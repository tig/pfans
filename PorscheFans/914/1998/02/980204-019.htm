That Kit that you had was a Revell, I believe, and I understand that
that was reissued last year, but no clue as to who might have one. I
would also be interested in this fine 1/25 set, esp for the 914.  Let me
know if you locate one. Suggestion: buy one of the scale modeler
magazines, and start calling the classifieds in the back. I did this a
few years ago, and got my die cast models that way. Sure would like that
bigger build it myself version.
