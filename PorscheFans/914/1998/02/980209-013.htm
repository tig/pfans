Yeah, that's a good point.  When mine dropped, I was doing a compression
check on a the hot motor, and I didn't disconnect the fuel injectors.  I've
heard (after the fact, of course) that that's a bad idea, since the hot
valve seats and the cold fuel/air don't mix too well, and it's an ideal time
to drop a seat.  The reason I was doing the compression check, though, was
because I was noticing a little white smoke and thought I might have
adjusted the valves all wrong.  In hindsight, I think that the adjustment
was O.K., but that I had already started to loose a seat.  When I dropped
mine, it was after the second rebuild.  During the first rebuild, I'm not
sure what was done to the heads, since the PO did it.  All I do know is that
he put in brand new sodium filled valves.  During the second rebuild,
though, my valve guides were showing signs of excessive wear, so I had those
replaced.  Perhaps the process of heating the heads up and cooling them down
to get the old guides out adversely affects the seats...  We should put
together some statistics.
