	That, my friends, is the start of shipwright's disease.  Or have
we renamed it Dirk Wright's disease by now?   ;^)

	The factory front bar is one single size.  I think it is 16mm, but
it might be 17--it certainly isn't as big as 19.  However, an aftermarket
through-body-type swaybar of 19mm (or even as big as 22mm, if adjustable)
will make a REAL difference in handling.

	If the front end is lifting a lot, then you either have THE most
pumped-up 2.0 motor I've ever heard about (lifting both wheels), or you
already have a sway bar (lifting one wheel).  If you mean that the car
was pushing a lot (front end loses traction, you turn the wheel and the
car goes straight--also known as "understeer"), then adding a front sway-
bar will only exacerbate the problem.
	Modifying the line you drive will help with the push a lot--in
fact, if you're getting a non-sway-bar 914 to push a lot, then either
something else in your car's setup is off, or you're on the wrong line--
or both.
	Positive camber on a 914 is a Bad Thing.  It won't do anything
good for your tires, and it will not help your traction at all.  Negative
camber is a Very Good Thing.  I find that a half-degree to a full degree
of negative camber up front, and a half-degree more in the back (that's
one degree to 1.5 degrees) is a reasonable setup that helps the car stick
a little better, but doesn't chew up the tires *too* badly.  It will tend
to wear the inner corners a bit more, but you'll be wearing the outer
corners a lot if you do much autocrossing.
	For most street tires (not aggressive autoX type tires), run the
maximum pressure specified on the tire.  You do lose some contact patch,
but it will probably be more than offset by stiffening up the sidewalls.
You can bleed air out of one end if the other end is sliding too much
for you.
	You'll hate the ride on the street, so bleed them back down to
the neighborhood of 30 PSI when you're done.

	Take an instructor along, and learn the line.  You'll be amazed
by how much faster you can go with just a couple of small improvements.
And most of all, HAVE FUN!!!
