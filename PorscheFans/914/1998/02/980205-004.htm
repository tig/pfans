You all have our 914 catalog the 1.7 intake  boots are listed at 10.00
each and have been the same price for at least eight years.  Maybe too
much, but the price is very plain and obvious. As you know your order
took awhile as we had a hard  time getting this last batch and price
suffered by purchasing them from Porsche and having to pay 5.60 each! We

always call if there is a price change.  No price change was noted on
your order Ed, and in fact we had reduced the price to eight each.  You
will get an immediate refund upon the return of the boots.
   It is more important to us to stock absolutely everything for the 914

and suffer the high inventory costs than to try to compete on price
stocking only the stuff that can achieve high markup.  The day that 914
parts evaporate is the day the hobby dies.  We are trying to prevent
that.
