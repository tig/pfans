The Porsche 914 Club is still in existence!! There are changes taking
place in the Club, an election will change some of the Club's Officers.
There is a new TTT in the "can" just needs to be printed!! Everybody
should have received their Members Directory (compiling this has slowed
down the Editor). We are sorry for the inconvenience and hope everyone
hangs in there. Remember all Club events and publications are put
together by VOLUNTEERS. Anyone who has a good story or tip can send it
in to the Editor. Comparisons of The Porsche 914 Club to PCA is unfair
because PCA has a paid staff to produce Panorama and attend to
membership issues. I am not bashing PCA ( I am a member myself ) it is a
great club with more members and a lot more money.
