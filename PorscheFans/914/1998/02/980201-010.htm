Andy,

     This is not really a big deal. When I had to do all of mine, I used
a dremel with a cutting wheel to carefully slice through the metal band.
I think that you could even use a pair of small, sharp angle cutters to
nibble your way through. This sounds to me as though yopu have the
original Porsche factory lines on there. You should know that all 914's
that have not already had these replaced are eligible for a still active
recall which will give you new fuel lines all over the engine
compartment, including the properly angled lines to the injectors from
the fuel rails. If you cal our Friendly neighborhood Porsche dealer with
your VIN they will verify eligibility, and then order the kit free parts
and labor, and they even give you a new battery cover. I had mine done
last August. When they do the recall, they put screw clamps on the
hoses.                                           Good luck, Jim S.
