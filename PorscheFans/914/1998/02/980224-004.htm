OK, so we have finally got off our duff's and done some hard planning.
Here are the details:

The First East Coast Ramble is tentatively scheduled for June 12th, 13th
and 14th in Virginia Beach, VA. The facility currently scheduled to host
the event is the Founder's Inn (http://www.foundersinn.com/), located 15
minutes from the beautiful Virginia Beach resort area. There is a block
of 20 rooms on hold with a special rate of $79 per night (which we were
able to have discounted from their daily rate of $159). Also, there are
20 larger style suites which are available for $89 per evening and up.

There are a number of events planned such as; a show and shine (maybe
with awards!), cookout/barbecue (we don't know if there is an additional
cost for this yet), a "ramble", a non-competitive AutoX, a tech session
presentation and quiz, special event T-shirt, awards, and more (any
suggestions? Send them in!). Generally the spirit is a *lot* of 914'ers
getting together to talk, have fun, and have more fun.

To help us out in determining how many are interested, please go to
http://www.wgss.com/914/ramble.htm and fill in a pre-registration form
and send it in,  BTW: There are no registration fees for this event...

Thanks,

John
