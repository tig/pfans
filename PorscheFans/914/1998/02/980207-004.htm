Regarding the opinions written the last couple of days about Automobile
Atlanta.  Many people have stated that we need every resource that we can get
to keep our cars looking good and running correctly.  I currently have 3
914s and I personally dont care if they all go out of business tomorrow.  If
AA doesn’t give appropriate service, I am sure that they will not last into
the next decade.  And if they dont,  there will be some one else to take there
place and hopefully do things better than the last guy out there so they dont
follow the same example.  I have personally had many problems with such
company’s and I like to hear both positive and negative responses from
customers of such companys.  It helps me decide the way that I might handle a
clerk taking the order or decide if I even want to do business with the
company at hand.  In this case, I believe Automobile Atlanta benefits from
keeping up with the 914 forum and hearing Eds complaint.  For every one
complaint, there will be aprox. 120 people that could hear about it and
companys need to remember this.  In AAs example, they have the chance to nip a
big problem in the butt before it may get out of hand.

PS.  To Ed.  Dont let anyone tell you what you may and may not talk about on
this forum.  This forum is for everyones 2 cents.  Some people dont like what
they read in the news papers, but it is freedom of the press.   I love this
country!  And  personal examples of poor service are not bashing.
