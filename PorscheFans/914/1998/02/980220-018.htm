Hi guys: This past week has been particularly good for the list. I wish that I
lived closer to most of you  (only for porsche stuff). The east and north
meetings sould particulary neat and I would really like to meet Dirk. On
reading the responses to the heel and toe, would it be possible for Dave and
some of the other racers to kind of tell the rest of us what went on the last
time they were at the track. I live in Fayetteville, Ar and although I raced
in gymkana's back in 1974 and 75 on mall parking lots, there is no place close
to even think about racing. for you dave with always driving with the top off,
I drove my car today for the first time in about 6 mths with the top off.
