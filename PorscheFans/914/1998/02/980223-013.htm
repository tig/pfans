I'm not familiar with the 286 deg cam, but am assuming it to be a 'mild'
cam (since the rest of your engine is stock)?  If so, you are suffering
major over-carbing!  40 IDFs would be a better setup for a 1.7 or 1.8
(and really, for a stock 2.0 also).  But assuming you don't want to go
out and buy a new pair of carbs, your best bet is to down-size what
you've got.

Let me guess, you have to rev the engine before starting from a dead
stop, have no driveability (ie. car only goes if the gas pedal is flat
on the floor), you are getting about 15 mpg, and your exhaust smokes a
lot.

If any of this sounds familiar, I'd like to suggest 30mm (or maybe 32,
depending on that cam) Venturis, 125 gas, 185 air, and 50 idles.  The
F11 tubes are the right ones.

You are currently running a .77 (gas/air or 135/175 = .7714) fuel-to-air
mixture.  Any type IV engine (excepting extremely high performance ones)
will run best with .66 - .69 mixture (this will depend some on your
altitude - higher altitude may need slightly richer mixture - if you
spend your time driving the Pike's Peak road, your mixture may be just
about right).

I don't know the physics involved, but in practical terms, too big of a
venturi will kill your mid-range driveability and too small will kill
your upper-rpm power.  You really need those babies matched to your
displacement.  I'm running 32mm in a 40 IDF on my 1.7/1.8 (don't ask) VW
bus and I really wish I'd gone with 30s instead.

If you don't have a good linkage that is easily adjustable and will STAY
properly adjusted, get one.  I recommend the Weber X-bar.

Hope some of this helps.  If you want to discuss it more, let me know -
I'll be happy to shower you with my (mis)adventures of carbureting.
Also, if you need any pointers or advice on balancing your carbs, I'm
pretty experienced with it.
