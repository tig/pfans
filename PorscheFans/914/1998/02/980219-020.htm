Anyone have a factory front swaybar for sell? Did the front bar come in
17 &
19mm?

I auto-crossed the car week ago Sunday at a "Spokes" event (local club)
-
first one for me and it was a blast! (Sorry I missed the Longhorn event
Mike,
I didn't want to break something that far from home.)
The front end seemed to be lifting alot - an oldtimer suggested +1 deg
camber on the front (like on the rear). Anyone have experience with
this?
I ran 30 psi in rear and 34 psi front on 185x70 15 street tires.
Any recommendations on psi?

Hi Alan!  Glad your 1st A-X experience was good.  

Does your car have a swaybar?  I A-Xed mine on street tires and no
swaybar for nearly a year and frankly, the thing looked like a
pissed-off seagull on course.  Every corner the inside front would lift
and look like the Karate Kid doing his funky 1-legged kick thing.  The
back end was VERY easy to swing around (did teach me to be gentle with
the throttle tho...).

I installed a factory 16mm front swaybar, rear Bilsteins with adjustable
spring perches and 140lb springs, and KYB shocks up front (hey, they
were cheap!).  The difference was unbelievable!  I know, I know, all you
guys out there with your 22mm adjustable bars are saying the factory
bars are worthless, but in comparison to NO bar they are incredible.
The nice thing is that they don't cost much and the work you do to
install one prepares the car for an upgrade to a bigger bar later - just
slip it in!

If you're looking for a factory bar, you might check with Cory Acuff
here in SA - he's got a couple parts cars sitting around.  If you want
to get in touch with him, e-mail me off-list and I'll give you his info.
