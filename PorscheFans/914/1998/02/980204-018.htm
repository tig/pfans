Hello Ed and teener's, 
I can tell you what else you will learn, since I have been right where
you are and spoke to George myself , but guess I didnt get him on a good
day, but mine wasnt about money, just additude....
You WILL get the 100% refund, but in AA CREDIT, not Green!
Have fun spending that one, guess you'll have tp buy something else to
use up your AA credit ;   )

Later, 
 Don
Btw; No Sorry needed, except maybe for the 3 or 4, George fans on the
list.

> asked if that meant I was lying, they said nope, just that George never said
> $10 . At one point I was asked if my car was carburated, implying that I may
> have asked for something else and quoted that price. NOPE. I KNOW WHAT I asked
> for and what PRICE I was quoted. So I said I'll ship them back but I refuse to

> okay! By the way I just got a set of intake hoses from GPR, $4 each, $16 for
> the set. Thats still 1/2 of AA's price. Sorry for taking up band width.
