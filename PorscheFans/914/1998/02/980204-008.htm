Start of part 2 'floorpan replacement'

When you get the segment/pan out, examine your new pan for how it fits.
Thoroughly clean the sites where welding is to occur by using any method
that works. .scotchbrite, sanding disk, sandblast, spit or prayer. .
You can resegment the new pan to patch the holes in your car, or if you
fabricate small sections to fit, replace only those bits.  This requires a
bit of skill (naturally).  (ask me about this -later)
This is where your draftsman skills come to fore. .use the machinist scale
(metric or english) to measure and sketch the hole you just made.
There are a variety of clever methods to depict on paper the shape and
dimensions of the hole you just hacked into your car.  Fabricating these
is yet another art.  Depending on how complicated the target patch is,
will determine how hard and how much time its going to require.  Some
forethought before you cut out the old stuff is a good thing to do. . .cut 
only
what must be removed.  If you dont destroy the bad chunk, you can use it
as a pattern to forge a new part.

  The important thing is to know every single place
where the new stuff fits up to the old and the welds are going to be to
tack it back in.  Then get out a drill with a nice sharp bit, preferably a
stepped Uni-Bit, because now you are going to create the 'spot' welds
without a spot-welder.

If you are just patching a segment, you will probably do mostly 'butt'
welds.  To be effective at this and avoid warpage in the panels, you
must space the patch edges no more or less than 1/16" (2mm) all around
the periphery where the butt welds will occur.  Start by placing a 'tack'
weld at 2 inch intervals, alternating around the patch like you were 
torquing
head bolts.  This will minimize warpage.  Follow up by MIG'ing in between
the tack points, but dwell only a short time to avoid overheating the panel
and warping it.  Use a wet rag to cool the welds as soon as you de-energize.

 -did I say keep everything as clean and cool as possible?

If you are flange welding, pick your points to spot weld (use the old sites)
and center punch/drill a 1/4" (7mm) hole at each site.  These will later
become 'rosette' welds, you will MIG through these holes to the original
metal, and then fill the hole and voids.  If you have the skill, the 
finished
weld will be only slightly above the original panel surface and require
very little follow-up grinding.  (who said . .bullshit)

Ok, time for a little admonishment. . .what you need here to be effective
is PENETRATION, by that I mean fuse the new metal to the old.  To do
that you must get things molten hot, not hot enough to blow a hole*1, juuust
hot enough to flow everything together real nice. . .this is where that
wide-screen, gold-plated, low shade factor welding hood viewplate
comes in handy.
With it you can 'see' the temperature of your weld by how red/orange
it is, you can see that steel just starting to boil -oops! too late.

*1)  blew a hole eh?  use a thick copper 'spoon' and hold it over
the hole from the backside.  Take the mig stinger and zap around
the periphery of the hole, dont worry about penetration yet, but try
to fill in the void by tickling the trigger and feeding some stock into
the edges of the hole (its ok to use a weld rod too).  When you get
the hole mostly filled, lay into the hole a lot of heat and pile on the
slag.  If you have to, stop and grind off the gross excess and start
again until you narrow the hole down to size, -try again.

You gotta know, man.  There is no substitute for experience here.
A major problem with swapping floorpans is that they are on the
underside of your car.  Unless you have a rotisserie (like me) you
are gonna have to occasionaly weld upside down (inverted) while on
your back.  You better have your ducks in order, like leather apron,
gloves, and crotch armor to keep from tattoo'ing yerself permanently.

Ok, its late and I'm done, someone stick a fork in me -or tell me what
I left out.  I await your detailed questions.
