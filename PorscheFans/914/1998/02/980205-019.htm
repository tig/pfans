7s will fit if you get enough offset in the rear. The fronts will fit
with stock offset. I saw a black 914 running in Palm Springs with steel
7s a bunch of years ago.

The 7 inchers will work fine up to 205/50 or 205/60 with your stock
wheelwells. If you want to go to 225/50s get ready to stretch the rear
fenders using the famous "ball batting" process. I understand if this is
done properly that minimal cracking of the paint will occur. Some people
on this list can help you with that procedure.

If you know someone who has a front Weltmeister mounted get ahold of the
directions on mounting it with templates, etc. I mounted my front
Welmeister without taking out the gas tank, no problem. You'll need "U"
bolts, though.
