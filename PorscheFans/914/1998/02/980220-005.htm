Where I work, there are a lot of cheapskates and procrastinators. They will
drive the worst pieces of junk and wait until the thing blows up before
doing anything about it. Even the so-called "car guys" are this way. I have
one friend that drives an '87 VW Golf with a big rust hole in the inner
fender well, plus other misc. rust. The A/C compressor squeals like a stuck
pig. He says "it's fine." He had a blown head gasket, but he kept putting in
Barrs Stop Leak to put off doing the repair. Finally, when that stuff didn't
work anymore, he broke down and spent the 100 bucks or so on fixing it. Now
he has a leaking radiator that he'll probably wait, and wait, and wait to
fix. Another guy has one of those V8 conversions on a Jag XJ6. His motor is
completely worn out, but he still drives it, been doing that for a couple of
years now. The ball joints in that car are extremely sloppy also - I mean
"ka chunk" sloppy. Then there are others that use junker cars as daily
drivers and have either a restoration project waiting in the wings or a
"nice" sports car for special uses. 

This behavior just drives me crazy. I take pride in all my rides, no matter
how humble. I admit I don't understand this mentality. Denying yourself the
pleasure of a nice car just doesn't make sense to me. Pretending to be a
"car guy" but abusing the crap out of your ride is just plain stupid if you
ask me.  I take good care of all my cars and I repair them promptly before
they have a catastrophic failure. I have a strong feeling that I am in the
minority on this one, though. Just about everyone that I know that has a
"speciality" or "classic" car uses something else as a daily driver. But,
attitudes are different in different clubs. The 914 people that I know
usually have something else as a daily car, but the Corvair people do not.
The BMW Bavaria folks usually drive thier car daily, as do the 2002 people.
I think the BMW CS coupe people have some other ride for daily use also. 

I suppose everyone has thier reasons and justifications for doing what they
do, but for me, if I can't drive my "classic" car whenever I want, then
what's the point? The fellow above with the Golf beater has a '73 Cuda back
in Ohio that's been sitting for 10 years waiting for him to "get around" to
restoring it. Now, this guy has piles of money stashed away, so that's not
the issue. His wife does hate the car, which would be a problem if it was me
(I bought the BMWs because my wife liked them, they were not my first
choice, buy I like them plenty now). So, why wait for that "someday" when
your classic car is restored and drive trash now vs. driving a classic car
everyday? I'd sure as hell would rather drive a classic car everyday than
have one sitting in storage awaiting restoration. My situation is money
limited, not motivation limited. I'm plenty motivated (my maxed out credit
card is testament to that), I just don't understand those that gots the
dough, but just sit on it, pretending to really want a classic ride. I mean,
part of my decision making process for selecting an appropriate classic car
revolves around parts availablity and enthusiast following. 

The cars I have are my only rides. I don't have a honda-this, or a
nissan-that for that rainy day. So, I have pressure on me to keep these cars
dependable, which means that I cannot procrastinate a repair, and I cannot
be cheap about it. I but new OEM whenever I can, and I'm thankfull that the
parts are available at all. I realize that the old car hobby is not for the
faint of heart. You cannot have an attachment to the cash in your wallet nor
to a lazy sunday afternoon. Just about every weekend I'm doing something
with these cars. It just so happens that I have this affliction and
affection for old machines that has been with me since childhood. I'm sure
I'm in the minority in this world, at least by looking at the people where I
work. There is only one person here that I know of that likes the same kind
of cars I do : old European sporting machines. He is more cash limited than
I am, but at least he's interested in "upgrading" and "hotrodding" his ride. 

I mean, how can you claim to be an enthusiast without wanting to make your
car "better", what ever that entails? I have plans, boy do I have plans, for
upgrading all my cars. It's in my blood to re-engineer the cars that I have
and to offer free advice to others on doing the same. Of course, the "car
guys" here don't listen to me very much, they have long considered me a nut.
I'm sick of giving advice that's ignored - what's the point? I always tell
people "buy the car that makes you crazy with happiness", but nobody
listens. Why would want anything less? If everytime you see your car, it
makes you feel good, how much money is that worth? That's priceless to me.
I'm sure some of you with restoration projects in your garages just grab
something to drink and sit out there and gaze for long periods of time. I
know I would if I had a real garage. 

Take pride in your ride, you deserve it.
