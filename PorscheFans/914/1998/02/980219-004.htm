What timing, I went to their web site in Jan and ordered a set for my 914.
They can in Tuesday night, with a note asking me to just send them a check
for the amount of the order.

The 4 - 914 bleeders came to $28.00 Looks like $6.50 each  + 2.00 shipping.

They look cool and come with 1 page of directions. The only problem that I
can see is that they are made from normal inch sizes, so even the metric
sizes have normal inch hex sizes for wrenches.
So to use them you must have an SAE wrench to fit them. Not a big deal but
they tell you in advance that that what you need so you can add one to your
track box.

PS: the part number they shipped me was SB7100 which the catalog says is 7mm
x 1.0 thread

	I seem to remember someone writing about replacement bleed screws
with
	check valves in them. Are these readily available, and from whom?
Also,
	what size (if there are different sizes) would a stock 79 924 use?
	While I am writing, I have the impression that the OEM wheels on
this
	car were some sort of spoked alloy wheels with 4 bolts. Can these
still
	be found? Does anyone have a set tucked away holding up a pallet or
	something? TIA for any responses.
