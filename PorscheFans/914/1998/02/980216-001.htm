   The Haynes manual isn't so bad; it's really a very valuable tool,
as almost everyone has one, and whenever someone has a problem we can
usually say something like "look at the picture on page 115" and then
go on to amplify.
   Speaking of the picture on page 115, please do take a look at it. 
 It shows the outboard venting clearance being adjusted.   The screw
mechanism for the inside piston is very similar to that of the
outboard piston, with two important differences.
  1.  The inside screw turns in the OPPOSITE direction to the outside
screw to retract the piston:  COUNTER-clockwise retracts the piston;
clockwise drives it in.
  2.  You can't get at the adjusting screw at all until you remove
the protective cap that is threaded in over it.  This cap also
normally has a 4mm hex socket in it, and can be removed using the
same tool, but ONLY when the calipers are in like-new condition (the
condition assumed by most shop manuals, including Haynes).
   After years of sitting there, the cap corrodes itself into place,
and can be extremely difficult to remove.   If, as I suspect, someone
else has already tried and failed, the hex socket in the plug will be
hopelessly stripped, and in that case, the only thing to do is to
remove the caliper, and extract the plug on the bench.   The last one
that I removed required the application of a cold chisel and hammer
on the edge.
   If the hex socket in the cap is still good, inserting the tool
into the cap and striking the end of the extension a couple of
moderate blows with a soft-faced hammer should serve to break it
loose.
   Once the plug is out, a replacement plug with a hex head can be
fitted (available from Automotion; see their latest catalog page
126).  Incidentally, if this has already been done, you will need to
try a socket (I would guess around 10 mm; does anyone else know the
size for sure?) to see if you can remove the plug, but most probably,
you have the originals.
   Once you have the plug out, the 4mm hex tool will easily adjust
the caliper piston position.  A note of caution: the adjusting screw
is really a small pinion gear with a hex socket in it's end... it may
stick to the tool and come entirely out of the caliper when you
remove the tool... if it does, just polish the tool slightly with
fine emory paper until the adjuster slips on and off easily, and then
use the tool to re-insert it into the caliper.
  If you have to remove the caliper to get the plug out, you will
have to bleed the entire brake system after you re-install it.   It
would therefore be a good idea to check the condition of the plug in
the other rear caliper, and deal with it at the same time, if
necessary.   No point in bleeding the brakes twice. 

					Good Luck,
                                                            Jim T.
