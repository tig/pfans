	Pano is the national PCA magazine.  It covers all models of
Porsche.  Due to the fact that the 914 is not one of the most popular
Porsches (and probably also to the NARP factor), you can go several
issues without seeing any real 914-specific info.  Generally high
production values, nice and slick and glossy.  I love the articles
about the old Porsche race cars.  A very nice magazine, evidently
comparable to (maybe even better than!) the best car-club magazines.
	It also comes out every month.  The TTT is scheduled for every
quarter, but has evidently gone on hiatus after Q3 97.  Due primarily
to the lack of an editor--a common problem with small club newsletters.
(As a side note--one of my local regions now only has a flyer full of
ads.  The bylaws say that there has to be a newsletter, and they have
a contractual obligation to run the ads.  But nobody has stepped up
to take on the job of Editor.)
	So, in every respect but 914-specific information, Pano
really whomps on the TTT.  Actually, since TTT is not being produced
any longer, it also whomps on it there, too!
