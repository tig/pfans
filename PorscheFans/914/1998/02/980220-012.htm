I'm certainly not one of those "Gotta do it the factory way or else
types". But the fact of it is, once that piece of teflon tape gets
loose, one can only hope that the strainer (if you have one) catches it.
It's not a sure fire thing that the teflon will find itself trapped by
the strainer, or even go in that direction.

By the way, I don't have a strainer now, the extended oil trap makes
installing a strainer problematic. Yes, others have done it with their
traps, but I tried for while to figure out how I could keep the strainer
on mine and couldn't find a simple solution. The new engine (someday)
will have a strainer, but it'll also have a canton-meca oil filter and a
deep sump.
