The gas heaters only came in the 73 Thing, the 74 went to the standard VW
heater boxes.   There were only about 25k Things imported total and more
74's than 73's.   The gas heaters  are a popular item for Thing owners and
hard to find in good condition, probably need rebuilding if you did.

What about the units that came in VW Things?  I'd guess they'd be available
at salvage yards for less than anything new.
