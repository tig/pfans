I believe that's correct.  My understanding is that in 1975 (and 1976) all
914's had smog pumps (air pumps), and the "California" models had catalytic
converters as well.  Somewhere along the lines, I think a few got PCV
valves, but I'm not sure which ones.  Basically, there's a pulley attached
to the engine's impeller which, using a fan belt, turns the smog pump.  The
smog pump continuously injects air directly into the heads just before the
exhaust gasses enter the heat exchangers.  There's a set of pipes attached
to the smog pump with a small hose, and "injectors" attached to the pipes
which screw into the heads.  The concept as I understand it is that the
additional air combines with any hot unburned fuel in the exhaust, causing
it to ignite, and thus reduce the hydrocarbons.  Based on my experience,
attaching the smog pump more than tripled the amount of hydrocarbons in my
exhaust, so maybe I'm just not understanding it correctly...

Hope this helps,
