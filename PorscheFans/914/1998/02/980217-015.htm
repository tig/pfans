		The first kind is a CD (capacative discharge) system.  It
	actually retains the points in the distributor.  However, rather
than
	having all the current that goes into the coil go through the
points,
	the points in a CD system only pass a very small current.  That is
	used as a "reference" for when to trigger the coil.  The triggering
is
	done by other components.  This is a pretty good system, and is the
	type that came stock with a lot of 911s--I think all the way up
through
	the 77 model year.

		MSD is probably overkill for a street application.  You
should
	not need to have multiple sparks going off during the exhaust stroke
	in a reasonably-maintained street engine.  I have heard (a few years
	ago) that the main reason for the multiple-spark ignition is so that
	you can use higher heat-range plugs in your race engine without them
	fouling at low revs (like in the Paddock).

	Dave and Sam,

		The reason I pick the MSD is that it is easy to install, it
is a fancy CD system, it gives a real hot spark, that works all the time,
and lastly it can be had in the $85 range which is only a bit over what the
point replacement kits cost. The installation is simple, and it come
configured to drop out of the system with 2 jumpers.

	I put it on my track car, which I drive to the track, and the car
always starts right up and runs fine driving it through the local streets
and traffic up to the track and back. It has been in there 4 years and I
have not touched the points or the unit.
