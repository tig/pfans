Hey folks (both sides), lets remember why we're ALL here.  Our ultimate goal
is the preservation of our 914's.

No matter what our personal opinions of AA are, we should all agree that the
state of 914's today would not be the same without AA as a valuable resource.

I also think it's great that AA pays attention to this list.  I seem to
remember that George used to contribute a lot more that he does now.  I
assume it's because every time he does, someone else complains.

Now,... I'm sure that AA would still exist without me (I haven't spent that
much there), and yes, I've bought parts from other sources, but there are
just some pieces  that are unavailable everywhere else.

So my point is that let's take every resource for what they are, and what
they can contribute -- nothing else.  Let's not burn bridges.

(Sorry for my venting)
Rgds,
Jeffrey Dunning
