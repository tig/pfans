> What the hell is a 'guibo'?

OK. I'm guilty as charged for starting this one again from my post
yesterday.  A guibo, as I understand it - is a Bimmer rubber doo-hicky
(like a doughnut) that goes in-line with the transmission and drive
shaft.  In practice, I have no idea what their purpose is, and only know
that Dirk Wright was intent on saving them:-)

The get together you are referring to is not, in any way, to be confused
with the one in Columbus OH.  I'm sure that one has *real* planners,
scheduling coordinators, etc.  Our get together will be on the East
Coast - so far narrowed down to somewhere between NC and NJ in the
spring/summer time frame...  We are still working out the details from
there.  And yep, there has been an incredible amount of interest in
it..  So far - we have about 20 - 30 folks who have expressed an
interest...  Not bad, eh?  Anyway, this thing is snowballing pretty
fast, so Ed and I are in the more serious planning phase.....

Hope you can make it - and nope, showing up in a 914 is *not*
mandatory.  So far we have a Bimmer, a Mazda RX-7 and a number of
Detroit's finest hardware that want to make the pilgrimage...
