Do you also hear it in 5th gear as well? If so, then most likely it's a
road speed dependent issue. When I had whine (as opposed to howl, the
two are different) in 4th and somethimes 5th, it was two things. One, a
bearing in the transaxle had gone south. And two, the pinion gear had
chunks of metal missing from the teeth. Yet another P.O. horror story...
