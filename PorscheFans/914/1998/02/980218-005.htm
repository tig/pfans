Hi Kyle

Sorry, but I can't resist adding aa few items of interest  - and you
bet, the blower housing is a *PIA* to repair, but, to make it easier,
IMHO here are a couple of tips.....

> The problem

Don't try to unclip them - yes they will break the mounting tangs (did
on one of mine). The solution is to "slide" them off their tangs with a
screwdriver...

> and the actuator cables with those snap
> clamps.

Loosen the box and pull it out a couple of inches.  That allows you to
actually reach the clip and mount.  The metal retaining clip is held
onto its metal base as it clamps the wire.  Take a jewelers screwdriver
and pry the clip between the retaining tang and it's metal base.  If you
try to just pull the clip off using the wire, you'll break the box....

Yea, that's why I re-lubricated mine - I figured it would give me
another 10/10  of lifetime lubrication (10 seconds or 10 tries to get
the thing working again - whichever comes first:-)

Obviously, you haven't seen my 914:-)  I'd rate them as about equal...
