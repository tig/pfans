I still haven't attached all of the heater equipment, so I might need to
wait a little while before I come up and visit  the canyon you keep teasing
us with.  Now, here's my current suspicions:  When the car was in the shop,
they did a compression test, and the results were less than perfect; 115 on
the low end, and 140 on the high end.  With the high-compression pistons,
fly cut heads, and no head gaskets, I expected closer to 150 all around.
So, I put two things together:  less than perfect compression, and behavior
similar to a vacuum leak, but no vacuum leaks found.  The only thing that I
could think of was that the heads weren't seating against the cylinders.
So, I crawled under the car, and sure enough there's a small line of fresh
oil running in-between the head and cylinders on the driver's side.  I'm
guessing that during intake I'm sucking in unmetered air, and during exhaust
I'm loosing compression.  I'm praying that re-torqueing the heads will do
the trick, but I fear that I may need to drop the engine and install some
head gaskets after all...  what do you think?
