This one took me a while to get, but it came eventually.  The drivetrain
of the car is in three pieces - the engine, the half of the transmission
that connects to the engine through the clutch, and the half of the
transmission that is connected to the drive wheels.  When you let the
clutch out, blip the throttle, and put it back in, you're making sure the
first two parts are at the proper speed for coming into contact with the
third piece.  Without that blip (or with that blip but without letting
the clutch out), part of the transmission has slowed down and will take
work to get back up to speed when you shift.  So, the extra step saves
some speed (although probably not a whole lot), and extends the life of
the synchros.

Please note that I'm not a mechanic, although I am helping one put his
kids through college.  If anyone can clarify (or possibly correct) what I
wrote, I'd appreciate it.
