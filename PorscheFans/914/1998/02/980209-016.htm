O.K., I dropped my car off at a new shop last Thursday, and called today to
see if they knew anything.  As a quick re-cap, here's the major symptoms:

Car hunts at idle - the warmer it gets, the more it hunts.
Car cuts out at constant throttle, and will cut out under full throttle when
the engine warms up.
Smog readings indicate a CO that fluctuates between 1.1 and 3.0, and a HC
between 800 and 2000 ppm.

He says that he's tracked it down to the Manifold Pressure Sensor (which is,
of course, brand new from Bosch).  He said that the epoxy plug needs to be
pulled, and it needs to be adjusted.  Since the MPS is brand new, I'm a
little skeptical, but I've given him the go-ahead nonetheless.  Can anyone
explain to me how adjusting the MPS might resolve these problems?

Thanks,
