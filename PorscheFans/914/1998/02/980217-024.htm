I'm beginning to think that there's an enormous conspiracy against me to
keep me from ever legally driving my 914 again...  I picked the car up at
the shop last night at 9:30 and drove it home in 20 degree temperatures with
no heat.  It was definitely better than it had been, and with Dave's new
injectors their exhaust gas analyzer was reading 1.96% CO and 383 PPM HC.
So, today I took a long lunch, went home, swapped plates with my legal car
(the 914's plates expired a year ago), and took off for this little
emissions place by my house (it's actually called Shoebox Emissions).  I
decided that I'd take it to this one, since last time they passed me on the
visual inspection even though I didn't have all of the air injection/smog
pump stuff hooked up.  I cruised over to the shop enjoying the 914 for the
first time in more than 18 months, and as I glanced in my rear view mirror
just two blocks from the emissions place, I noticed a cop quickly
approaching.  When I stopped at the stoplight, the cop was right behind me.
As I mumbled "shit, shit, shit," to myself, I began to think that I had
nothing to worry about since the plates on the car had valid stickers - and
as that though crossed my mind, she turned her lights on.  I pulled over on
the shoulder, and in an attempt to look responsible handed her both plates,
two copies of my registration, and both the insurance card for the 914 and
the rabbit (the car the other plates had come from).  She came back a little
latter, and told me that she was quite surprised.  Most of the time she
finds that people driving with the wrong plates are usually driving stolen
cars... but not me!  Both plates were mine, both cars were registered, and
both cars were insured.  She told me that she sympathized with my plight,
and said that this was a first for her - and then handed me a ticket for
$84.00!  Damnit...  so, I drove the remaining 50 feet to the emissions place
just wanting to put all of this behind me.  He hooked the car up and ran it
through the routine, and while it was being tested, I noticed that it was
backfiring on occasion.  I thought, "Oh great... yeah, I'm sure cars that
backfire pass all of the time!"  When it was finished, he handed me the
emissions paper, and as I quickly scanned it, I discovered that I was within
spec!  "I'm sorry you didn't pass - why did we fail you the last time?" the
emissions guy said.  What?!  I'm within spec!!  I didn't understand what he
was talking about, and it must have shown on his face, because he then said,
"This car is supposed to have a smog pump and air injectors... sorry!"
After mumbling what must have been a thousand different expletives, I
climbed back into the car and returned it to the garage.  If it doesn't snow
tonight, maybe I can get the damn air injection hooked back up and try this
again tomorrow...  there was one thing that REALLY struck me as odd, though
(like the rest of it wasn't!)... the emissions paper indicated a CO of .18%
at idle, and .14% at 2500 rpm!  I would've figured that the car wouldn't
even run if it was that lean.  So now, I get to try to figure out how the
hell it went from 1.96 % to .18% in 20 miles.  I'll keep you posted... if
I'm not committed to an insane asylum first!
