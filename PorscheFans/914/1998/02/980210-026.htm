   In looking through my Bosch electrics book, I am pretty sure that
you will find this problem to be a bad voltage regulator.   This is
the only component in the circuit of interest that is in the engine
bay and thus subject to temperature fluctuations.   There is a remote
possibility that it could be the alternator, but the regulator seems
much more likely.   The alternator field winding is energized through
the idiot light and the relaxed contacts of the regulator when the
ignition is on, but the engine is not running.   My best guess is
that these contacts are worn out.   
   It is possible for this to be an alternator problem, but if so,
the idiot light should be lighting while you drive, and you should be
experiencing symptoms of flat battery, which you do not mention.  
I'd check the charging system voltage while the engine is running at
2500 RPM or so to be sure that you have 13 volts or more;  you may
find that this value is not achieved even though you have not
experienced battery trouble as yet.  In any event, I'd try a known
good substitute regulator first.   I got my replacement (after-market
solid-state) at Pep Boys for about $13.00 as I recall.

					Good Luck,
                                                            Jim T.
