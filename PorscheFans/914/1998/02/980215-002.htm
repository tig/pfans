Hi Ken,

I've also looked into batteries, and have decided against the Optima for 2
reasons:  weight and cost.

I'm running a regular sized Interstate battery in my car.  I stuck a small
hose on the vent tube between the battery posts, and ran the hose down under
the car.  I figure that the charging fumes would be safely dissipated this
way, reducing the chance of rust.  This is how BMW deals with fumes when
they mount the battery under the rear seat.

If you use a 1/4" ID hose, you shouldn't have any problems with it filling
up with road crud.  I used a clear vinyl "fish tank" hose which was lying
around the house.  If you like, cut the tip at an angle for the "road draft
tube" effect, or point the hose slightly towards the tail of the car.

cheers, Brian Ng
