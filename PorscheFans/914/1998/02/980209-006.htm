I would've highly recommended replacing ALL of the valve seats when you
dropped the #4 intake seat.  When my valve seat dropped, it held the valve
so wide-open that the piston smacked the valve.  Since this isn't the case
with yours, I can't guarantee that you've dropped another seat, but it does
sound like it.  The only way that I can think of to check is to bring #3 to
TDC, back the rocker arms way off, and see if the tops of both valves are at
the same height.  If they're not, then there's definitely something holding
a valve open.  I've heard that it can be caused be excessive carbon deposits
breaking off of the valve, but since you have so few miles, I really doubt
it.  If you've dropped a valve seat, I would get ALL of them replaced, with
the possible exception of your #4 intake.  I had mine done by Mark Stephen's
High Performance, because they offer a 100,000 mile/5 year warranty.  I've
only put about 100 miles on my heads so far, so I can't say anything good or
bad yet...

Good luck!
