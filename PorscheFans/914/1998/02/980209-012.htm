	Funny, I had the EXACT SAME THING happen to me!  All the teardowns
made me quite proficient in removing and dismantling a 914 engine, but all
the same, I really wish I hadn't had to go through that.
	I basically agree with everything JJ says.  Do them all--intake
AND exhaust.  The one that you've already replaced should be OK, but do ALL
the rest.  Also have the head carefully checked for cracks around the spark
plug holes, and in the intake and exhaust ports.  Cracks should be ground
away, together with the surrounding material, then the material built back
up by welding.  Not a process for the faint of skill!
	If your local shop has a good reputation, and you know that they can
do the aluminum welding, you might consider going back to them.  This is
when you get to see if and how their "customer service" works.  If they try
to blow you off, then don't go back.  If they will try to work with you,
then consider them still.

	This brings up a point that I've been pondering.  So far, in three
recent cases, we have had valve seats fail JUST AFTER an overhaul.  Could it
be that the seats can only be ground so many times before they get too weak
to hang onto the head any more?
	At the moment, this is just idle speculation.  We need a lot more
facts before we come to any solid conclusions.

	Question for the list:  How may people have dropped valve seats in
their Type IV motors?  If so, was it very shortly after an engine rebuild?
