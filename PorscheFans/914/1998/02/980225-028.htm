To the list,
Anyone who was going to send me a 914 photo, please do not send. I will not
get to see them. A million thanks to you who did send a picture of your
baby. It will not be wasted as my wall framing will continue now along with
some 914 repairs that I have been convinced I can do for very few dollars.
Thanks John.
 
My system monitor is kapoot. Writing this with one borrowed which I have to
give back in an hour or so. Watch what you say because you never know when,
as Arnold says,"I'll Be Back" with a borrowed screen. :-)

Now to add to my fury, the damn server is down. System manager says all
Memphis Internet connections are down. Time Warner is the feeder and just
like their cable system, always a _ _ _ _ _ _ g problem.  I am sure some of
you would not want this kind of language blaring from your WORKING monitor
and I respect that.
 
I'll miss all of the mail, especially my recent education on teflon tape. :-)
Hang in there Dirk. You tell it like it is and I hope more of you will
always be that way, concerning your 914 aspirations and tribulations!

If any of you Eastern Americans haven't done so, better latch on to the fun
you will miss by going to The Great Eastern Coast Excellent Adventure if you
get half a chance. Show the Western Coast you have got a 914 ride too.

Cool thought of the day. by The Southern Knight, mikecool! 1998

"I complained about my 914 not running, until I saw a person who had no 914
to run".
   
Take care.
Love ALL 914's, ALL the owners, and ALL 914 vendors. Without a doubt, the
finest group of people on this planet. BAR NONE.
