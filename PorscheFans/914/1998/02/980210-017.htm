I dunno, that seems a tad steep. Granted, a fresh factory bumper is
considerably more expensive than that, but then if the option to go
glass is offered, I'd think alot of folks would go the 916 route. Sure,
there'll be a few who want their race car to look like a street car, but
I'm not sure if there'd be enough to warrant the cost. But that's just a
guess on my part...
