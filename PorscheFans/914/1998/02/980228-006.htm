So I played hooky for a few days from the office and worked on the 914.
My web page is woefully behind the actual progress, so here's where I am
as of this evening (Saturday):

- The factory flares are welded on, faired and all 4 fenders are
primed... (THEY LOOK OUTSTANDING - but it takes about 8 - 10 hours per
flare/fender to do them right...)
- The 911 engine ('82 3.0) is rebuilt and ready including the 914-6
sheet metal, valves are adjusted, new chain ramps, updated tensioners,
etc.
- The 901 tranny is apart for a new 1st synro and dogteeth gear..
- The engine compartment is stripped to bare metal and is primed.
- New battery tray and mount is welded in.
- The outer GT Rockers have been fit and ready to go in.
- I'll weld in the engine mount this week (Vellious).
- The clutch, flywheel, TO bearing, etc have been trial fit (a 225mm
flywheel.)
- The entire body will be primed either this  week or next.

So much for now...  I'll keep you posted on further details of the
rebuild and Ramble (Thanks to all 30+ who have registered in the first 3
days!) and BTW: Nick Cole has generously offered his house as a meeting
place (Maryland - Bethesda) to those that want to drive down as a group
from the north (Thanks, Nick!)...  I'll update the Ramble Web page
(http://www.wgss.com/914/ramble.htm) this week with some anticipated
*great* late-breaking news...  Ed and I might have really pulled off a
good one (I think!!!).  Stay Tuned!

John
