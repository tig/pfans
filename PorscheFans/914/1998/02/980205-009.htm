Greetings again all.

That felt so good that I'm gonna serve up another delicious
nutritious pant-load for those interested.

This is a followup to the 'floorpan replacement' how-to I
penned yesterday in a rant.
Many of the same 'prerequisites' mentioned previously
still apply -with one major addition to the routine.

To replace an inner or outer longitudinal, you first need to
stabilize the body, so the doors still fit when you get done.
In the Factory manual section 8, there is a reference to a
'door frame tool' of sorts (I dont recall the exact nomenclature)
This tool bolts to the door hinge mounts and attaches to the
lock post.  I highly recommend using something equivalent.
I suppose you could tack weld the doors shut and later cut
the tacks.  It depends on your level of fortitude.

Replacing an outer long is simpler than replacing an inner.
Mostly because the floorpan is attached to the inner, and you
have to wrangle with that as you do the swap.  I opted to
patch only selected bad sections and spots on my inners
since the floorpan was in fair condition. (my '73 car)

The 914 longitudinals are like a pair of long clamshells with a
spotwelded flange along the upper and lower edges.
These form the 'frame' of the car between the front and rear
wheels.  Removing the entire longitudinal will include the jack
mount.  These too can be replaced 'while in the neighborhood'.
The front end of the long may also have a solid plate spotwelded
over the end as an added brace.  These tend to rust away because
of their proximity to the forward wheel well.  These are fairly easy
to fabricate from sheet stock.  (20-21 Ga. steel, 1-1.5mm)

Along the upper flange is also mounted the threshold plate and
below that a few braces, possibly with holes to accomidate the
air conditioning hoses.  Inside the long is a heat conducting
hose and a support that is riveted between the inner and outer.
A replacement long will not come with  the braces or threshold
plate. . .which means you will have to fabricate or transplant
these items.  The threshold plate is brazed at the forward and
rearward ends.  Braze contaminates steel to the point it is
nearly impossible to MIG to, so it either has to be throughly
cleaned or re-brazed during the reconstruct phase.

Begin the longi swap process by first removing the threshold
plate using the aforementioned rotary spotweld cutter.  These
cutters have a spring loaded guide pin that you should center
in a dimple you put into the center of the spot weld you wish
to remove.  Mine was less than $20 and chucks into a drill.
The cutter eats the steel away from the periphery
of the weld.  Once again, dont cut too deeply or you will have
a 3/8" hole thru both layers of steel.  These cutters are rather
delicate because the teeth are similar in style and pitch to
a woodcutting saw blade, tempered and brittle.  You must
try to get all the teeth to seat on the target surface at once
or they break off and then you need a replacement.  Keep
replacement cutters on hand, because you will need them.
The key to using these is to watch the teeth depth, or watch
for a puff of rust as the cutter dips thru the first layer of steel.

There may be many or few spot welds to cut in this manner,
and then you must cut the threshold plate at the forward and
rearward ends, nearest the joint seams.  I suppose you could
heat the braze and separate them, but I had success with
just using the 1mm cutting wheel on a air die grinder to do the job.
Then you must also cut the spotwelds along the braces just
below the plate, you have the option of cutting them at the
longitudinal, or cut them from the threshold plate.  I prefer
the longitudinal since I'm assuming you are doing a full longi
and this will re-use the positioning of these braces.
Once all the weld sites are clear you can take a pry instrument
(I had a favorite 1/2" wood chisel) and 'pop' each spot site
until somewhat loose.  Each of those spot welds you cut
will now look like a hole or a steel tablet, depending on your skill.

Next you are going to cut the longitudinal's spot welds along the
flanges.  This should leave you with the front and rear ends of
the longi to cut.  Remember to cut the two rivets holding the
internal warm air tube's support to separate the two longi halves.

Depending on the severity of rust damage, you
can do a partial or full swap.  I prefer to replace only that which
is horribly involved with rust.  This leaves undisturbed the parts
of the car that are factory constructed. . .you can't go wrong
unless your seam welds are really poor.  By this I mean that
to cut a section out of the car and seam (not flange) weld two
panels edge to edge is a delicate situation because the car is
depending on these structures for integrity and that is difficult
to acheive in a butt weld unless you are very good at fusing the
two ends into a single panel with original strength.  In cases
such as these, it is advisable to overlap then rosette and lap
weld the adjoining sections to guarantee structural integrity.
By the way, if you cant get enough heat out of the MIG into a
weld site to ensure penetration, it is ok to oxyacetylene weld.
The 356 rustorer I spoke with used MIG and oxy welding almost
interchangeably, but I think oxy overheats the panel and alters
its strength character.  (it is also a bit more difficult -for me)
