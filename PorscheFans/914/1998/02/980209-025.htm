	AA never done me wrong- and their catalog is the only source
of those part drawings I've ever found. Having owned old VWs, one
old 914 and one Triumph, I must say you can't *IMAGINE* feeling 
ripped off until you've tried to get old British car parts. One local
place told me they'd order something for delivery within weeks, and
went out of business three years later having never delivered. Yeah,
I shoulda demanded a refund earlier. And the vendor shouldn't have lied
to my face, and every time I called on the phone. That's what I consider
a BAD vendor. So far I've managed to avoid that kind of thing in the
aircooled world.

	That trip-odometer design is common to VW busses and the same problem
occurs. The considered wisdom there is to reset only when not moving.
