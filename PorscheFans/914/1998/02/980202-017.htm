Well, since you asked... :)

It's not the ECU that's really the problem in outfitting a 914 with a heftier
cam. The problem is in the very principle of the D-jet FI. The D-jet uses
manifold pressure/vacuum to moinitor intake conditions, and a tweaked cam will
create pressure waves in the intake tract that confuses the pressure sensor.
Yes, pressure waves exist all the time in an intake system, but D-jet can only
handle so much before the MPS starts giving screwy signals to the brain.

At least that's my understanding....

That, and the MPS. That's how it can compensate for variations in atmospheric
pressure too.

I don't remember who it was, but someone said they were going to send one of
their brains to go get picked apart. I'll dig through my files and see when
that was.
