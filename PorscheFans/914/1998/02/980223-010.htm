I've had the same problems with a 75 side-shifter (now wouldn't a
side-shitter be strange? (see below))

For the most part, the problems have been rectified by 2 simple solutions:
(1) Replace the tranny fluid with Redline synth, or another good fluid.
(2) Adjust the shift linkage.

Always check the simple solutions first before tearing the car apart.

Rgds,
Jeffrey Dunning
