Okay, I finally got caught up on two weeks worth of 914 digests -- whew!

Pertronix and Compufire are electronic points, not electronic ignitions!  I 
have a Pertronix in my VW Squareback and a Compufire in my 914.  I found 
the Compufire easier to install than the Pertronix, but that's just 
splitting hairs.  Both have been serving me without problem for several 
years.  When ordering be sure to say whether it's for a FI or carbed 
vehicle (one of the two manufacturers makes separate versions depending 
upon the distributor).  Also, you may need to adjust your timing once 
installation is complete -- I did on both vehicles.

Another advantage with electronic points over mechanical points:  No point 
float.  My Squareback really lost rpms over 5000 when I had [stock] 
mechanical points.  When I switched to electronic ones I kept on reving 
without hesitation (uh, engine hesitation...I hesitated, though).

One option for electronic ignitions not mentioned is one step better: 
Computerized ignition.  I have the Jacobs Bug-Pak on my Squareback and it's 
the greatest thing next to my 914!  It does a better job than a capacitive 
discharge (CD) system since it is continually adjusting the spark duration 
and power output to each individual spark plug.  Misfires are a thing of the 
past!  My plug gap is .045", gas mileage increased +2mpg both city and 
highway (sorta a transaxle thing I'm correcting), my timing dropped ~.6 
seconds and, what I could actually feel, my available torque increased as I 
was now able to accelerate on a hill in 4th gear that previously made me 
drive at a constant speed.

I also am using Jacobs 8.5mm spark plug wires.  Even when used on the stock 
ignition setup I had a tad more torque and better gas mileage (both pretty 
small but there nonetheless).
