	Getting rid of the points is one of the nicest things you can
do for your 914.  Maybe even better than getting rid of your (single?)
carb.
	There are three kinds of electronic ignitions that I know of
that are generally deemed appropriate for street cars.  (There are a
few more types that are GREAT for race cars, and inappropriate or too
expensive for street cars.)
	The first kind is a CD (capacative discharge) system.  It
actually retains the points in the distributor.  However, rather than
having all the current that goes into the coil go through the points,
the points in a CD system only pass a very small current.  That is
used as a "reference" for when to trigger the coil.  The triggering is
done by other components.  This is a pretty good system, and is the
type that came stock with a lot of 911s--I think all the way up through
the 77 model year.
	The other two types totally replace the points.
	The Pertronix uses the Hall effect to sense when a magnet is
"close" to a pickup.  If I understand it correctly, you put a magnet
on the distributor shaft under the rotor.  The pickup bolts in where
the points used to be, and provides the exact same signal that the
points used to.  Or that they would have, if they had been "ideal"
points.  The connections are, I beleive, identical to standard points.
(I could be wrong on that.)  Basically, the whole shebang fits inside
the distributor, and is pretty unobtrusive that way.
	The final kind uses an optical trigger.  A slotted disk fits
over the distributor shaft under the rotor.  A pickup with an LED and
a photosensor bolts in where the points used to be.  The disk inter-
rupts the beam from the LED to the sensor, unless one of the slots is
between the two.  That's when the spark is fired.  This system, made
by Crane Cams based on an Allison design, has a "box" that is external
to the distributor.  The signal goes from the pickup to the "box", and
from there to the coil.  You have to mount the box somewhere--I have
it on my firewall.  The box hooks up to the coil (both + and - termi-
nals), and to an external ground.  So it doesn't look stock.
	Both of the latter systems are affected by shaft wobble.  If
severe enough, either may misfire.  Of course, if it's that bad, your
distributor is probably already in pieces and you'll have heard it
long ago.  But the wobble will change your timing, as it would with
points.  The Hall effect sensor is more sensitive to up-and-down play
in the shaft.  The Hall effect varies as the fourth power of the dis-
tance (if I remember correctly), so small changes in distance can have
large changes on the signal from the sensor.  But again, this is most
likely not a problem unless your distributor is REALLY badly worn.
	If I remember, both the latter two options have similar prices.
The Pertonix is probably a bit less expensive.  Oh, for stock (vacc
advance and/or retard) distributors, the Pertronix has to be modified
with a Dremel to clearance for the advance/retard mechanism.

	MSD is probably overkill for a street application.  You should
not need to have multiple sparks going off during the exhaust stroke
in a reasonably-maintained street engine.  I have heard (a few years
ago) that the main reason for the multiple-spark ignition is so that
you can use higher heat-range plugs in your race engine without them
fouling at low revs (like in the Paddock).
