The question was asked:
Which brings me to a question:   Isn't there an after-market
helper spring that one can install into the shift linkage to make the 
second-third gate more positive?   I seem to remember once reading 
about such a thing, but now I can't recall where I saw it.   Am I 
hallucinating again, or is there really such a thing? And if so, 
where can I find one?

Yes, there is and it's made by Weltmeister.  I bought the dual spring kit 
from Automotion.  The kit comes with two springs, two pins, four circlips 
and instructions.  It requires drilling holes in the stop plate and 
inserting the pins next to the stock ones.  This was an easy operation but 
it sure was difficult to get the springs compressed on the pins during 
installation.

It was during this modification that I noticed I needed a new stop plate 
and bushings (that thingy that holds the shift rod spring).  Groan.  So I 
put it all together since it was my main transportation and ordered new 
parts.  Shifting was less vague as shifting from 1st to 2nd you just push 
the shifter and it automatically snaps out of 1st and goes to 2nd (you 
don't need to guide it like a stock shift would require).  Putting it into 
reverse or 1st is an obvious maneuver and it will make your shifting 
shoulder a little sore the following day as you get used to it.

With the new stop plate (from Performance Products) I found that it was 
impossible to drill through (I need better drill bits).  I'll be damned if 
I was NOT going to use the spring kit so I was actually able to insert the 
Weltmeister springs on the stock pins *inside* the stock springs.  
Basically it looks like I have dual springs on the pins, like what you'd 
see for dual springs on a valve train.  Works great, but compressing BOTH 
springs is a real bitch.

WEAR SAFETY GOGGLES!  I did and, though I wasn't hurt, one spring launched 
7' across the room and made a small mark in my wall (I was living in an 
apartment at the time).

Shifting is soooo much easier for all gears now that 1st and reverse are 
basically 'locked out'.  Now, if I wanna install a short shift that means I 
gotta remove those #@$!* springs...maybe I'll wait on the short shift  :)
