Wow - is my mail server broken or is this list *slow* today????  Six
(yes "6")  whole messages posted to the list all day (discounting mine -
that make "5")???

Anyway, I have received a number of e-mails about the "East Coast
Ramble" I mentioned in my last post, and here is the deal....

There is another 914'er who is rebuilding his car (Ed Villela - the guy
that started the supplier thread on the list...) in NJ who wants to meet
in June/July in an informal "ramble" - as we are doing similar rebuilds
to our respective 914's.  The "ramble" has gotten a lot of interest from
my earlier post...  So, since I'm in NH and Ed is in NJ, any suggestions
to location would be great!!!!

So far, there are a small number of us who want to make a weekend out of
it - and frankly, I'm more then willing to drive south from NH (to VA or
so?) to do this right.....  *But* we need some input to location, dates,
number of days, etc.......   Any input sent to me, or Ed (yes, Ed, I
just volunteered you) would be *great*!  We'll keep the list posted..
BTW: Yes, we've even considered renting out LRP (Lime Rock Park) for a
day of track stuff....  Anyone else interested?

Also, I updated my first 914 page a little earlier to include a
"Thoughts at this stage" section.... (at http://www.wgss.com/914/).....
