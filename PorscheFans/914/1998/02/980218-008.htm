There are a couple of things you *can* do -

Lubricate the rack pivot points (those big mombo bars that get pushed
back and forth to move the wiper).  There are two pivot points as well
as where the bar's bushing that actually connects to the motor.

You *could* take off the top plate of the motor housing and lubricate
that white (plastic?) gear - but caution - that has three long metal
contacts that ride on top of it.  Do not bend those - it will throw off
your "wiper parked" position and speed contacts.  My suggestion is - if
it "isn't broken don't fix it"..

Another word of advice though - the wiper motor mount is held in place
with a rubber piece with a bolt that extends from the dashpanel (as well
as the two body wiper mounts).  A 10mm nut unscrews from that
rubber/bolt thing.  Use Liquid wrench and soak that nut pretty well - if
it sticks - you run the risk of tearing that rubber mount....
