On second thought Dirk - you can just borrow the pictures of my car
(sounds like they are in equal stages of "resurrection") - except your
914's trunk is filled with BMW parts.  My trunk is filled with 914 parts
I can't figure out where I took them off of, as well as tools that I
spend hours looking for (especially that darn 1/4" sockets in 6 & 7mm
sizes)....

Hmmm, here's another option, open for list members discussion...
I say we consider we all descending on Dirk's garage for a day or two
before the ramble - and get his 914 finished up.  If we all stash a
couple of spare parts and make the trip, betcha we could get it back
together in no time at all.... Dirk - your responsible for buying the
beer - but you also *hafta* stay out of the garage.  Simple debates like
proper bolt strengths, optimized torque settings, over-sized bores, etc.
have no place in this proposed "assembly line" procedure and will only
serve to distract us. We'll do it "by the book" - only if one is
available. If not, we'll improvise...
Here is how I've broken out the preliminary list of responsibilities;

Ed Viella - Ordering *your* new intake boots;
Rich Johnson - rebuilding the brakes/suspension;
Perry Kiehl - Checking for rust;
Dave Darling/JJ Slowik - Engine rebuilding;
Josh Hadler - Wheel/Tire selection;
Mike Cooley - Welding Supervisor;
Nick Cole - Using YOUR email that doesn't send winmail.dat attachments;
Wayne at Pelican Parts - Taking pictures for his web site;
Dan Freedman - Humor Supervisor;

Well, that's the short list, anyway.  Oh yea, as for me, I the official
beer taster...

(BTW: What's your address?:-)
