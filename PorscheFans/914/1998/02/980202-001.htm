Does anybody know of any companies in southern California that will widen
steel wheels?  My 2.0 has 5.5x15s on it now and I would like to widen them
to 7x15 to get a sleeper kind of look.  What offset should I ask for to fit
7x15s under stock fenders.  Will they fit.  I would like to run 225/60/15
tires or there-abouts.  Any suggestions?

On another note.  I managed to scavenge a front and rear sway-bar set-up off
of a 73 2.0 in the local yard.  The rear is a snap to put on but I dont have
the holes drilled in the body for the front one (it has the tabs on the
control arms).  Is this something I want to get into at home or should I let
a place like Ottos handle this.  This is kind of a pressing issue since I
also got a pair of 140lb rear springs out of the yard.  Since Ive put them
on the car's a little tail happy and I believe the sway bar should restore
some balance.

Thanks for your time.
