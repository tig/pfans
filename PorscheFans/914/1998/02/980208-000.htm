I was getting ready to have a nice evening out tonight when i hopped in the
914 and went to take off and felt a clunk then the clutch pedal went to the
floor and something ground... so i thought, " that damm clutch cable, i just
replaced it. " but alas, after removing the clevis pin to check for a
broken cable, it wasnt broken. So what can it be? my clutch is permantantly
stuck in. what should i look for and how do i fix it?

ps, i got george today while ordering brake pads, and i really dont see why
you all bash him so much, i am quite happy with all i have ordered form aa,
even if it may cost a little more, i know that i have someone on the other
end who can help, not just some teleoperator who takes orders, that is worth
a little extra to me.
