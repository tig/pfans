	The factory bars are not worthless.  They're very good for a
street car.  They are also all you can use in most PCA stock classes that
are anything close to actually "stock".  (Don't get me started on the old
now-outdated PCRs--just don't!)  In fact, they're so good that they are
just about mandatory if you want to compete in a real stock class!
	SCCA excepted, of course.  For whatever reason, everbody in any
class in SCCA can put any size *front* sway bar they want on any car.
	KYBs are also not worthless.  As you mentioned, they are a whole
lot less expensive than Konis or Bilsteins.  And they work pretty darn
well!  They are part of the "hot street" setup recommended by several 914
places that I know of.
	Of course, I do have the yellow Koni Gas Sport adjustables in my
own car...  But that's just 'cause I was trying to keep up with Brooks,
my main competitor.  (It didn't work, though.   8^(   )
