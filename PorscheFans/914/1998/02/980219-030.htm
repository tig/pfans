Teeners,
        I appreciated the overwhelming response on the rear caliper rebuild. 
 When I pulled mine off of the car, the passenger side unit had no fluid at 
all in it.  Upon disassembly, I found that the inner adjusters on both 
calipers were frozen solid.  The inner pistons would not budge.  After a 
quick trip to my mechanic, we determined that both calipers were shot.  $200 
later, GPR sent me two good used units.  They went on the car with no 
problem, but when I tried to bleed the system, it would hold no pressure.  
My suspicions were confirmed when I took the MC apart and found rust and 
worn out seals.  Another $100 to GPR for a 19mm unit, and the car is finally 
back on the road after a 2 1/2 week hiatus.  It is amazing how a simple pad 
and rotor change can turn into such an expensive odyssey.  
        The jumping out of first gear problem has been narrowed down to 
either a chewed up gearset or selector shaft.  Given the fairly high price 
of these parts, would I be better off replacing the whole tail-shift trans 
with a good used side-shifter? What would be the cost of this transplant?  
Anyone have a good used tail or side shift unit for sale cheap?  Are the 
gearset or selector shaft available used for a reasonable price?
        I have narrowed down the "buggish" sound to the diver's side carb 
(Dell 36).  The motor has now gone to studdering upon acceleration and comes 
close to dieing when I let off the throttle and the car is out of gear.  I 
recently tore the carbs down to clean them and replace gaskets, but I didn't 
mess with the jets.  There are no vaccuum leaks (checked with the starter 
fluid trick).  Any ideas?  The timing is dead on and the valves have been 
recently adjusted.
        Thanks in advance for your help.
