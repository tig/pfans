FYI- the subject of sparkplug wear came up on my motorcycle list, and I
thought this might be of interest over here...

Caveats:  The context of this particular discussion was racing
motorcycles, specifically 125cc two-stroke GP bikes that spend most of
their lives in the 10K to 13K RPM range.  Of other note is that this
discussion came about on how to recycle sparkplugs for said machine, as
they cost $25.00 each, and electrode wear at those frequencies can cause
mis-fires and loss of what little power those motors put out.  (BTW-
those little suckers put out ~40 HP- not bad for a weedwhacker, eh?)
