This is why I'm sending it to a shop.  I think I must just be terribly
deficient at checking for vacuum leaks or something.  All of the gaskets are
new (plastic intake runner blocks, new intake runner boots, new gasket under
the throttle body, etc.), and I've literally coated the engine in Carb
Cleaner without so much as a skip in the idle speed.  The Aux. Air Valve is
working (it closes completely in about 5 minutes), and I don't have the cold
start valve hooked up.  I'm hoping I've just missed something, but it sure
sounds like a vacuum leak to me.

Now, as far as the new mechanic goes, this is a little interesting.  My
other car ('83 Rabbit) suddenly started dying as soon as I gave it gas.  If
I gently blipped the throttle several times, then I could get the revs up.
Since my head is so crammed with how the 914 works, I haven't even bothered
to learn about the Rabbit's fuel injection.  So, I shipped it off to my old
"generic car" mechanic.  He found a vacuum leak at the Aux. Air Valve (I
didn't even know Rabbits had Aux. Air Valves!), and fixed it up for $30.
So, I asked him if he'd like to work on a 914.  He said sure, but when I
started telling him everything that I've done, he got scared and recommended
some place that I've never heard of.  So, I gave them a call.  They said,
"Yeah, we work on 914's all the time!"  I told them about my last experience
of having to nearly pay $800 for 12 hours of labor and no results, and they
said, "Don't worry... we'll figure it out in an hour and you'll only pay
$50".  So, the car goes in tomorrow and we'll see what happens!
