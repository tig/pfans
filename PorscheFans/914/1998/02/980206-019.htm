....That's the last paragraph.  What happens is that the little gears that
drive the odometer numbers are press-fit onto the shaft- resetting the
trip meter while the car is moving gradually "strips" this press-fit.

The basic gist of the web page I mentioned is simply to disassemble
the speedometer, rough up that shaft, press the gears back onto it,
and reassemble.  If you're careful, you can also try a little epoxy to
keep the gear from working loose again, but resetting the trip meter
while moving is still to be considered a Bad Thing(tm)
