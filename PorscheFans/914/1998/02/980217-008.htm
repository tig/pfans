Here is what worked on mine while I had mine out (actually, it's still
out - and I'm not sure my procedure is *documented* elsewhere:-)

Disassemble the box itself.  You'll notice that the box is clamped on
with retaining circlips and the motor itself is on the bottom of the box
assembly.  There are two things you'll want to check - the shaft
bearings and the motor brushes.  I used white lithium grease to
lubricate the shaft surfaces/bearings (which had gunked up over time)
and cleaned the brushes.  When I reconnected the terminals again after
the rebuild, the lowest speed setting started working again.  Also, you
might want to check the contacts in the throw lever in the cockpit to be
sure it's making contact at the lower settings.

Hope this helps...
John
