(Sorry if this is long and convoluted...)

I was tinkering with my 'teener the other day, and thought to start changing
plugs (I have no idea of the vintage of the set it's running on...)  The
first plug wire I grabbed, the boot cracked and broke, so I decided I'd hang
it up, pick up a set of plug wires, and take up again this weekend.  I
dropped the plug wire back in the hole, but didn't waste any time trying to
get it back on the plug as I knew I'd just be taking it off again this
weekend.  Now here's the good part:

Last night, a friend of mine asked if he could store his motorcycle in my
garage for a month or so until he found space closer to his apt.  Well, my
car already shares space with a couple bikes, and there's room for a couple
more, so why not?  When he brought the bike over, I went out, hopped in the
car, backed it out, let him park the bike, put the car back in the garage,
pulled the door down, and we went and had a beer.  Car ran fine.  (Ran damn
good, matter of fact...)  It just hit me a couple minutes ago that either a)
I'm was a really good shot with that plug wire, and got it onto the plug, or
b) the car runs better on three cylinders than on four...
