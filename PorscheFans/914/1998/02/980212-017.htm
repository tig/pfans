    Yeah, Brett, it does.

    Here's how it works:  The whole mind/leg/inner-ear coordination
    thing is much more sensitive to the PRESSURE applied to the pedal
    than to the DISTANCE through which the pedal travels.

    I have a potentiometer-and-strain-gauge-equipped pedal cluster
    (somewhere around here) with which I once demonstrated this
    physiological fact to a non-believing racer.

    When I locked the instrumented brake pedal in place, he saw that
    he could precisely and repeatedly press on it with consistent
    FORCE, but when I allowed the pedal to pivot, he found that it
    was much, much harder to consistently move it to a particular
    POSITION.
