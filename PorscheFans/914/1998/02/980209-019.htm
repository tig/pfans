	A recent visit to Palo Alto Speedometer greeted me with some
unpleasant news.  The news being that PA Speedo (and N. Hollywod Speedo
who are run by the same folks) repair bouncy 914 tachs by replacing an
entire (small) circuit board, to the tune of $176 and change.  Well,
I think there's an intermittent short in my tach, as well as it being
rather bouncy, so I had to go for it.  Well, also, I wanted to see
just how the rebuilt tach acted.
	The guy behind the counter there told me that they used to
diagnose the pieces of the board, but that it wasn't cost effective
for them--because half the time, they'd spend an hour or more on check-
ing the components, and the tach would still bounce.
	(This is sort of like Soren's Starter Fix.  It only works about
half the time, and it takes about 1.5 hours.  A professional shop can't
afford to try it when they'll eat that extra labor half the time, but a
DIY'er can, when it avoids buying a new starter half the time!  BTW,
Soren's fix is to take the starter assembly apart, and clean and re-
lube it all.)
	When they told me I needed a new circuit board, I said to go
ahead, but save the old parts for me.  I'm going to do a bit of my own
testing (Real Soon Now) and see if I can figure out if anything simple
is fried.  Then I'll try fixing it and using it in my spare tach (the
one I'm currently using) to see if it works.
	I have the old board now, but they had accidentally calibrated
my tach for a 6-cylinder tach.  Not much good on a 4-cyl.  I'll go back
tomorrow to pick it up when it's right.
	I'll let y'all know what I find out.
