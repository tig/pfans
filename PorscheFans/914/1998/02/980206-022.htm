I'm going to agree and disagree.

Agreement:  There is no such thing as a PERFECT vender.

Disagrement:  If someone thinks they've been screwed, they need to vent.

If they have indeed been screwed, the "power of the net" can be used to
straighten it out.

If they haven't, they still may need the support of their peers.

I too have spent many thousands of dollars on 914 stuff.  On a scale of
1 to 100,
the suppliers I deal with range from the low 70's to 90.  I give AA an
85 on my
personal satisfaction scale.

Gary.
