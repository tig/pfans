I'm going to Amarillo next weekend to get a 74 2.0 parts car.  If anyone
is looking for parts, let me know (I'm probably keeping the engine and
FI myself and the heat exchangers may be spoken for too).  I don't know
what all is there, but it is supposed to be a complete car - running 4
years ago and not stripped/parted yet.

I'm stripping as much stuff as I can fit in my VW Bus and bringing it
back on 3/2/98.  The rest I'll get this Summer so if you're looking for
something in particular, I'll try to bring it back this trip (this would
not be a commitment on your part to buy, just an addition to the stuff
I'll bring back on my fist trip).  No body parts yet - I'll drag the
carcass back this summer if its worth it.

Of course, if the car is solid enough, I may leave it whole so if
anyone's looking for a complete 74 2.0 project, let me know that too and
I'll fill you in on the details after I've seen the car.

All requests will be dealt with 1st come, 1st served.

Mike g.
74 2.0
