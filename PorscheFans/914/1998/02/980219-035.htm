Good point. It shouldn't be called 'Double clutching'. It's heel-toeing.

The reason why I double clutch every down shift is to _save_ my syncros.
914s are notoriously abusive on thier soft syncro rings, and I'd like to
do everything I can to preserve the life of my transmission. I'd rather
sink $750-1k into custom 3pc racing wheels than into rebuilding my
transmission. 1st and 2nd gear syncors if not babied will generally last
about 30k miles tops. Yes, replacing just the syncro and dog-teeth isn't
too terribly expensive, but I'm always falling victim to
"while-I'm-in-there-itis".
