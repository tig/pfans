Huh? I'm kinda familiar with Rich's collection of 'teeners, and a hopped
up 1.8 doesn't ring a bell. The car that one a whole bunch of
championships was indeed a 1.8L, but I wouldn't even _think_ of calling
that "stock looking". Yellow bird is an E-Production class, fiberglass
wearin', roof choppin', slick runnin', sewer pipe air ductin', screaming
race machine.

I'd agree on that account if you're planning on using an existing FI and
want to tweak a motor, that's the _type_ of injection to use. However,
L-jet is still pretty simple by modern standards. And I'd say the K-Jet
would probably be much more entertaining to retrofit to a 914 than
buying a used L-Jet to mount to a tweaked 1.7/2.0. If you've already got
the 1.8, then no biggie. But I like the idea of being able to run a
closed loop system. Call me weird...

All depends on who's working the station. A friend of mine once had his
'72 Landcruiser fail visual inspection TWICE because there was a small
little vacuum hose that was missing. Turns out that there was NEVER that
little hose and Toyota had mistakenly printed that there was on the spec
prints. My friend did get it resolved but he had to go through the
referee station twice as well. 

So beware. 

If your car is now exempt, or is soon to be so. Then GO FOR IT! You know
I will as soon as my car becoms exempt next year!

On another note, I am currently insured under State Farm, and did you
know that they have a special insurance for "vintage" cars? Yup. 25
years and older, complete coverage for a mere pittance. I'll be paying
something like $120 a YEAR for the same coverage that I'm getting now,
and I'm carrying some pretty thorough coverage. Heck, even if I'm not
super duper thrilled at my birthday at teh end of this year, I know that
my car will thrilled beyond words when it reaches 25! :)  Look into it
folks. But it will raise the rate on my other vehicle because a
"vintage" car for some reason doesn't count the same as a normal car and
I'll loose my multi vehicle discount. Still, it's a winning scenario for
me though. :)

Porsche, like a fine wine, gets better and better with age! :)
