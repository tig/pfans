> Hello Porschefans,
> 
> I have owned a couple of water pumpers for years, but in todays local
paper
> I found what may be a good deal on a 914.
> 
> Complete car: 1974 Porsche 914. I believe it's a 1.7 ltr.
> 
> What is a rolling project car going for these days?
> 
> The  seller/gentleman on the phone stated that it will start, but stalls
> after about ten seconds.
> Battery tray, and inner rockers are not rusted out. Car needs
paint/engine
> work.
> 
> Don't flame me too much, but how much are injectors? And what harm is
there
> if I installed
> webber carbs, and kept the injector systems? ( If I sold it, the next
owner
> could replace the
> fuel system).
> 
> If it was too far gone to save, how much would an intact 914 be worth in
> parts?
> Targa top, and interior is said to be really nice. (they always say that
on
> the phone).
> 
> I apologize, (as I'm sure this is in the faq), but what should I watch
out
> for on these cars? 
> Where are the trouble spots at?  What is expensive to replace. 
> 
> (I know...it's a Porsche...it's all expensive *L*)
