Hello ALL again.
Well, I got photos when I asked for them from the list. Some had the
greatest looking bodies that a person close to my age feels safe in
admiring. :-)

Seriously, I want to thank ALL of you who sent me your 914 photo. Not as
many as I had hoped, but definately enough to add factory decor to my room
that I dedicate to my computer and 914 interests. Lots of white walls in a
12x13 spare bedroom. 

If any of you in the future, get the urge, send me your 914 photo to add to
my wall display, which sums out at 17 personally sent to me which now will
reside in full color just above and to the left of my computer system as
soon as I get the frames for hanging.

I would like to mention someone who helped me with one photo of one of the
most beautiful 914s I have ever seen, which had a blemish by the scanner,
made even greater looking with John Utter's expert graphic blending. Thanks
John. You made the owner of that photo very happy as he told me so.

BTW. ALL the 914s were beautiful objects of art that have unique personalities.

Hmm....maybe my wife will let me render them in 1/4 scale on my garage wall
that will answer a challenge someone mentioned about my past artist talents.
Will have to be in B&W though as I am too color blind to separate close
similiar colors.
Similiar to an old flick with Alec Guiness, The Horses Mouth.

Thanks again to ALL of you.

Best regards.

Mike Cooley
