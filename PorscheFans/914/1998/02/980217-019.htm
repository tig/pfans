It's time for me to sell my dear old 914.  Years ago, I bought this
car as a perfomance commuter, and although I've upgraded some
stuff mechanically, I've neglected the cosmetics.  I've purchased a
nicer 914/2.0 and can't keep two.

California car, now in Redwood City, SF Bay area.

'73 body, original paint, light blue.  Was a 1.7 originally.
'74 2.0 engine, swapped in August, 1995.
Hi-volume oil pump.
Rebuilt tranny in February '96.
  New 1st & 2nd dog teeth.
  New 1-3 synchro rings.
  New 2nd-3rd slider.
  Otherwise inspected and fine.
19mm brake master cyl, stainless brake lines, all new in April '96.
New rubber seals around windows, doors, and roof, 1996.  Not leaking
  this winter.
Center console & guages.
All new rubber around the roof and doors.
Mahles & suburban tires (Michelin XZX).  Suspension adjusts well, tires
  last for many years.
All lights work; lenses are intact.
Mantainance for last several years by Rich B. at High Performance House.

Rust:
  Passes the "butt test":  doors open & close with top off & people seated.
  Battery area has some rust:  no real problem.
  Rust spots behind doors near pylons.
  Rust in front of windshield where front quarters join body.
  Front & rear bumpers have rust under the rubber.
  Numerous scratches & chips.  NEEDS paint.
  
Engine:  Generally good.
  When autocrossing (at Dublin, with PCA GGR), exhaust smokes when throttle
    is lifted quickly after high-rpm run.  Everyone tells me this is a worn
    valve guide.  I never see smoke in normal driving.
  June '96 checkup:
    Compression  1-140  2-135  3-135  4-150
    Leakdown     1-  6% 2- 34% 3- 30% 4-  6%


I'm asking $2500.

I can be reached by phone at (650) 367-9926, or at rdrain@slip.net

     Take care,

          Rick

NB:  the thing next most worth doing is autocross!
