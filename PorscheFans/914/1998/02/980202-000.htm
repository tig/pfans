Andy,
These hoses are crimped on the injector from the factory.  What you'll have to
do is very carefully cut only the crimped connectory off as close to the
injector as possible.  You'll only be cutting through thin sheet metal and
you'll have to cut all around the circumference (sp) of the crimped part.  You
could also use a dremel tool with a cut off wheel on it.  Just be careful that
you don't cut the hard fuel line center just under the fuel hose.
