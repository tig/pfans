 He put in a new one with a resistor, and now it doesn't
misfire!  He said that in order to get it to run good, he had to set the CO
to 3.5, which brings the HC down to under 600 ppm.  The limits for my car
are a CO of 3.5, and a HC  of 600.  So, it's a slim chance that I'll pass
emissions.  He thinks that the whole cause of the problem is one or more
slightly plugged fuel injectors.  He explained that if the spray pattern
isn't just right, then they end up needing to make the car run rich to bring
the HC down, since the "clogged" pattern results in a somewhat lean
condition, resulting in unburnt fuel and high HC.  It made sense to me.  So,
now I'm in the market for new fuel injectors.  Does everything this guy's
said to me sound honest, or am I being taken?

That sounds like great news JJ. I've been reading your saga all along. The
mechanic seems to know alot about the 914 and D-jet set-up. He seems very
thorough.The explinations that he provides for the repairs he's made seem
logical and believable. AND the repairs he made appear to work!! If your 914
runs well, I would consider it money well spent. I ran the injector part by a
mechanic friend of mine, he says that they could very possibly be giving you
the higher emmission levels. I think your mechanic is probably being honest
with you.

Good luck, 
Ed Villela

P.S. you deserve alot of credit for the all of the work you did on your own
and for taking the time to share it with us.
