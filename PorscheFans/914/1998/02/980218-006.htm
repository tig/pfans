Good point! Is there anything I should do to the wiper motor/assembly while
I have the blower and tank out?

And while I'm in there...
Anyone have a factory front swaybar for sell? Did the front bar come in 17 &
19mm?

I auto-crossed the car week ago Sunday at a "Spokes" event (local club) -
first one for me and it was a blast! (Sorry I missed the Longhorn event Mike,
I didn't want to break something that far from home.)
The front end seemed to be lifting alot - an oldtimer suggested +1 deg
camber on the front (like on the rear). Anyone have experience with this?
I ran 30 psi in rear and 34 psi front on 185x70 15 street tires.
Any recommendations on psi?

Thanks,
