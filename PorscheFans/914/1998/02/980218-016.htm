Aaaahhh! Teflon! Ick! 

Yes, in some applications, teflon tape can be a good thing. But for a
drain plug? I'd sooner just drop a piece of duct tape into the filler
cap. The problem I see with using teflon tape on teh drain plug is that
you'll need to be really really careful about making sure that the tape
that goes through the threads is not then exposed to the oil. Once the
tape goes through the threads it becomes torn and stretched, which is
why it seal so well -in the threads-. But once that bolt has gone
through the threads, you have all of these little stringy threads of
teflon that can then go floating around in your engine and get trapped
in some little oil passage (bearing) and block off the flow of oil. So,
that's why I use coppper gaskets instead. 

For something like a braided oil line fitting, I'll generally use the
tape because the threads are not exposed to the open flow of oil like
they would be on the end of a bolt. But I'm still quite conservative
with its use and make sure that it's all on threads that will not be
exposed to direct oil flow.

Naturally, this is all just my opinion, and you can do what you like
with it.
