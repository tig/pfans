Dion,

My understanding is that the 912E motor is a 914 2.0 motor, with the
injection from the 914 1.8 motor.

Nothing wrong with having VW build the motors; Porsche specified all
the materials and dimensions.  And if it makes you feel any better,
almost all 4-cylinder air-cooled Porsche motors are "mainly VW"
powerplants.  (The water-cooled ones are "mainly Audi" powerplants.)
