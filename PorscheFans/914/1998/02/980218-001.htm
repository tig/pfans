er, um,
Kyle asks. . .(I must've missed that one some where)
What the hell is a 'guibo'?

I've seen the chatter about the 914 tech get-together. .
Is this the same thing in Columbus OH?

 -that's 850 miles one-way from here using the straitest routes. .
Ooww!

Neither of my 914's is serviceable right now, but I've got a
new pickup w/less than 1200 miles on the clock. . .but it
gets less than 15 mi/gal (closer to 10 mi/gal) so that would
set me back over $150 *if* I went.  My new bride has
a Geo Metro with the screaming 3cyl. 995cc powerplant
 -but it needs all the belts replaced before it goes anywhere
and it is having terrible fuel mileage right now.  bummer.

I've got a 15 year-old stepson that I could feed soda pop and
candy canes. . .his mouth then runs 140mph, wonder if I could
get him to gnash on my '76's CV joints for about 10 hours.
Naw! he'd wimp out after dark.

I read somewhere that you can tell you are getting old
when you worry more about the price of a gallon of gas than
about how many beers to have at a (tech session). . .

I'll shut up now and return to my laboratory. .Igor, come hither.
