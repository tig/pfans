Greetings and Happy New Year!!
	First off let me say thanks to everyone that replied back to my locked brake
problem! It seems a little moisture and time worked against me there....

Secondly I need a little information concerning the relay under the passenger
seat of the '74's. Is there a way to safely by-pass this(perhaps someone has
done a little fancy wiring that would like to share their knowledge?)? My
interior light (pass. compt.) doesn't work, It was hacked up by PO, but I
would like to make it work. Does anyone have a diagram of how to bypass this
relay or an alternative way around it?

I seem to remember someone on the list mentioning a turbo kit. Could anyone
with this kind of info pas it along as well. I'm looking at various ways to
increase HP without doing the 6 upgrade for a couple of years. The wife and I
just had our first child so I don't want to get to caught up in my projects
right now. Just looking for a quick way to increase HP without tying the car
up for to long.
Thanks In Advance.  
Oh and my custom plate....    TI 3VOM    (read it backwards like looking in
your rear view mirror...)

Thanks!!
