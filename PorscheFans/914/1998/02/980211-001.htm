Well I finally installed the clutch cable.  Boy the center console makes
that more difficult than it should be.  I bought a TerryCable from Pelican
Parts.  I have nothing but good things to say about them.  Even though their
primary means of sale is mail order, they made an exception for me and my
sorta emergency situation and allowed me to come and pick it up.  This is
not standard operating procedure for them so dont assume that they'll do it
for everybody.  They even told me to call if I had any problems and they 'd
help me.  After years of working on my 'Cuda, Mustang, and Dakota Ive never
had any parts house or speed shop offer any sort of meaningful technical
help.  I hope this experience is indicative of the Porsche ownership
experience.
