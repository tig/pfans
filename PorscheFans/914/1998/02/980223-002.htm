After 6 hours of bruising my ribs and smashing my hands, I was able to get
the smog pump and air injectors hooked up on my 914.  So, I ran the car over
to the emissions place for the re-test.  Last time, my CO was .18%, and my
HC was 596 PPM.  This time, my CO was .14, and my HC was 1435 PPM!  All I
did was hook up the smog pump!  Fortunately, I had a variable resistor with
me, so I hooked it up in line with the head temp sensor.  After a quick turn
of the knob, the engine began to run much, much smoother.  I had the
emissions guy run another test, certain it would pass.  This time, the HC
dropped to 139 PPM, but the CO was 4.43%!  So, I turned the knob back a
little, and had him test it again.  Right back to where I started... .15% CO
and 1278 PPM HC.  So, I closed my eyes, listened closely to the engine, and
just tapped the variable resistor.  This time, the engine started doing
strange things.  When lean, it hunts and doesn't sound so smooth, but passes
the CO test.  When rich, it sounds great, but won't pass the CO test.  This
time, the engine switched between the two states on its own, once about
every three minutes.  As he hooked it up to the machine (for the 6th
time...), it sounded good, so I knew it would fail the CO test.  About
halfway through, it started to sound crappy again, so I knew it would fail
the HC test.  When he was finished, however, it appeared that the switching
actually negated each other, and I PASSED!  So, today during lunch I'll pick
up my new stickers and once again return to legal status!  I've started
digging around for possible causes, and I've got a bad feeling that I know
what it is, but I'll deal with that latter... I'm still too happy to worry
about other problems!

Thanks again everyone!  I couldn't have done it without you!
