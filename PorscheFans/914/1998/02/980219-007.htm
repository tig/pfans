Thanks to all for the excellent and clear education concerning electronic ignition.



Now I think I have a fair understanding of the available options, and am in between
getting one of two systems.



One from MSD (6AL) & "blaster coil"

 - or - 

the XR3000 & PS91 coil from Crane.



Both have things that I want, and both are around $200.   The MSD system has a soft
rev limiter, which I really want, but the Crane systems includes an optical trigger
which replaces the points entirely.  Crane does have another system (HI6) which has
a rev limiter, but this is already over $400.



I'm sure I can be happy with either system, but I just want to know if I'm missing
anything, like other manufacturers, or add on components to these systems that would
satisfy my requirments.



Thanks again for the info
