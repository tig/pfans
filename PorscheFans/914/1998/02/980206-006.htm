OK Guys,I think it's time to remind everybody that one person's bad 
experience is not indicative of everybody elses.  I've done business with 
George and AA for about 2 years now, and I started with them as a novice 
914 owner.  I've spent about $5000-6000+ on parts with them over two years 
and the only thing I've been unsatisfied with was the repro rubber seals, 
that by the way I believe everybody sells.  I had one occasion when a 1st 
reverse kit came to me for my 'teener and the synchro gear was wrong.  
That was not AA's fault, because the package was assembled as is before AA 
get's it.  George immediately shipped me another gear, and if my memory is 
correct I was not charged extra shipping on that gear, my account was 
charged, but was credited promptly when I returned the bad part.  

Given all that for what it's worth, I suspect George has saved me several 
thousand dollars with *FREE* advice about reparing my car for the price of 
several phone calls, and as a result I was able to do practically all of 
the work myself.  AA does charge ALMOST as much as my local Porsche dealer 
for parts, but I can't say that I could call up the local Porsche dealer 
and find anyone remotely interested in talking to me about my 914 problems 
for more than about 2 seconds. The standard response is make an 
appointment, bring it in, and leave it with us for a few days.  

To say the least, it is gratifying to work on your own car, and for those 
of you who are not mechanically inclined, you know how expensive it is to 
have someone else do it for you.  In terms of prices, I can't say that 
I've ever had a price change for an item from what it was in the book when 
I ordered it.

That's my $.02.
