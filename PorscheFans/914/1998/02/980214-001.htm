Hello ALL 914 owners.
I was wondering if any of you would send me a photo image of your 914. I am
wanting to cover my walls I use for my computer room with 914 images that I
can print out. The files my computer system support is TIF, JPG and PCX. 
If you will send a small message as your name and 914 year and then attach
the picture file it would make an old man very happy. Does not have to be a
perfect 914, but one that you don't mind sharing a picture of with me.
All will remain your property as I want them only for my personal use as
wall covering in printed picture format in my home. I want them to be
personal so images at web sites won't do. Besides those are copyrighted and
to print them for personal use is a violation I have been told.

Thanks.
Send them to me at mikecool@netten.net
