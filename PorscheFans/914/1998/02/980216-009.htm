Hi Dirk;

You bet we'd want to meet up with you and others from your area...  Both
Ed and I are quickly coming to the conclusions that far more 914'ers are
south of us rather then north...

> I'm in Northern Virginia, I'd like to participate. We could visit
Summit
> Point Raceway when the Porsche club is out there (I'm not a member),
or we
> could all go to the vintage races they have in the spring.

Also, I realize that not everyone who is a 914 owner is a PCA member, so
here is what I'm trying to do:

Since I'm pretty active at track events, I'm trying to find out what it
would take to get an insurance rider if a number of non-PCA and/or SCCA
members want to take their cars out during either an SCCA and/or PCA
event.  I don't know the answer yet, but I'll keep the list posted.  I
think it would be really great to see a class of 914's only out on the
track - but we'd need to have probably 15 - 20 914's who want to come
along...

If that turns out to be a "no option" then the consensus of the email I
gotten is to do a "drive get together". I think we could have a *great
time* meeting in a central location and driving the hills, valleys and
coastline of the surrounding area over a 1.5 to 2 day weekend.... (Our
goal is to make those on the West Coast extremely jealous!)

For me, I don't really care as to the overall agenda, as long as we get
the highest turnout possible (assuming it's not *too soon* as Ed's and
my 914 needs to be done:-)...

Anyway, definitely, we'll keep the list posted.  We *really* appreciate
those who have offered their houses to meet at, suggestions or events,
and local areas of interest....  PLEASE, keep them coming.  We are NOT
seasoned professionals at scheduling stuff like this - just folks who
want to get together around a common interest (and celebrate the fact
that our cars are actually drivable!)!!!

Please, any suggestions, offers, time frames that are better then
others, etc., let us know....

John Dunkle
