Gremlins is right.  I had all kinds when I got my car.  I eventually pulled
out and cleaned every contact. Instruments, fuse panel, ground points,
light connections.  Used a wire wheel on a Dremel tool.  This cleared up
all problems except the weird turn signal problems.  I isolated that to the
switch in the steering column itself.

The turn signal circuit is current based so all you mentioned, spring
contact pressure, corrosion, etc. will affect that.  I bought a new turn
signal switch from GPR and that fixed the last gremlin.

I also used something called Koprshield which I got from The Eastwood
Company.  Looks a lot like copper based anti-seaze.  Suppose to protect and
enhance the electrical contacts.

One thing I'm considering is to replace the stock fuse panel with one using
the new style Mini-fuse's if I can ever find one that will fit (car is not
concours so not worried).  Anyone ever find anythig that will fit?

Steve,
The next logical suspect would be the engine relay panel.
I had a '74 that would just stop every now and then.  I would take
a couple of relays out, switch them around, and it would run fine
for a while (week or so) longer.  Replaced the relay panel, and
it never died again.
I also had some gremlins disappear by replacing the fuse box.  I
inspected the fuse box after, couldn't see anything wrong, so I put
it back in.  The gremlins came right back.  (Weird turn signal
problems, that kind of stuff.)
My pet theory is that the spring contact both corrode, and loose their
spring with age, making the connections not quite good enough.
There is also a relay panel above the fuse box that deserves attention.
And if it's a '74 (and up???), the relay panel under the passenger seat.
Gary.
