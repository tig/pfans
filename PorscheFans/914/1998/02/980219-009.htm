Contact Summit Racing in Ohio, they are a big racer supplier that markets to
the Chevy Ford world, and their prices are set to that world. I bought a
full racing set for $75 a seat. They are full spec 4" x 6" set, with
mounting hardware.

I have raced for 4 years and never had a problem with either the belts or
the sanctioning bodies.

	Regards,

Dan

	Subject:	racing harness needed

	hi all,

	I have decided to start autocrossing !

	my friend talked me into it and he just found a local club for us to

	race in.  

	I remembered reading an article of a guy who had just bought a
harness 
	and compared the difference of seatbelt/harness to using the
steering 
	wheel as a grab bar/steering utensil. I really want to beat my
friend so 
	I figured I needed all the help I could. He has autocrossed before
but 
	not too much. He has a 1st Generation RX7 vs. my 1980 924. I hope I
win 
	:) I usually beat him outta the lights but he is getting better all
the 
	time :(.  anyway I am looking for a cheap harness

	it must have- 5 inch nylon belt ( i think they all do )
	            - 5 or 6 point ( i dont care which one )
	             
	- I don't know a whole lot about em so if you respond try to sell it
to 
	me,Tell me everything you know about it . 

	Basically I am looking for something cheap which i can put in and
out 
	once a month or so dosent have to look good just as long as it will
hold 
	me good.

	thx 
	danl
