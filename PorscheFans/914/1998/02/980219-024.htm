Sam,
	I can only tell you about the MSD. I have yet to meet anyone using
the Crane system  the MSD has al sorts of add-ons timing adjustments rev
limit's etc.

	If you are using the factory tach you will need the tach adapter,
which is just a coil.

	As for replacing the coil , I tried that and basically it did
nothing. The stock coil when coupled with an MSD-6x throw out an
unbelievable spark.

	I have found that Summit Racing in Ohio, is by far the best place to
buy this product. Summit is a Chevy, Ford, Mopar race house and they carry
all our goodies at Chevy prices.

Their web is http://www.summitracing.com/msdigntn.htm

I use the 6A  which sells for $125, the soft rev limiter is nice but I like
my toe's limiter better. When you have to go over limit you can, and in 914
sometimes you have to do that.


	Regards,

Dan

	Thanks to all for the excellent and clear education concerning
electronic ignition.



	Now I think I have a fair understanding of the available options,
and am in between
	getting one of two systems.



	One from MSD (6AL) & "blaster coil"

	 - or - 

	the XR3000 & PS91 coil from Crane.



	Both have things that I want, and both are around $200.   The MSD
system has a soft
	rev limiter, which I really want, but the Crane systems includes an
optical trigger
	which replaces the points entirely.  Crane does have another system
(HI6) which has
	a rev limiter, but this is already over $400.



	I'm sure I can be happy with either system, but I just want to know
if I'm missing
	anything, like other manufacturers, or add on components to these
systems that would
	satisfy my requirments.



	Thanks again for the info
