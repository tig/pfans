<< Can any one help me out with a wiring diagram for a 914/6. I have a set of
 workshop manuals, but unfortunately the diagram is listed in the contents but
 is not shown. Does anybody have one.....

Porsche only provided a poor one in dealer literature.  It is in black and
white without any colors indicated.  It was reprinted in Panorama, and is in
one of the Upfixin der Porsche volumes sold by PCA.
A guy by the name of Zapf printed up some wiring diagrams a few years ago,
again in black and white, but it had clors indicated on it.  It is far more
accurate than the factory one(!), but is copywrited, so I can't send you a
copy.  Does anyone out there know if Zapf still has the diagrams available?
