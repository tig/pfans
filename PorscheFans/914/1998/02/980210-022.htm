Hello Pfans
	I haven't posted to the list lately.  One reason was I had a major
computer crash, but the biggest reason is because I finally came to the
realization that I was not going to ever be able to get my 914 on the road.
 After reading all the great post on longitudinal repairs, my brain over
took my heart and I had to pull the plug on my project. (Just way to much
rust).
	There is a bright spot to this little story, I just recently found out
about a windfall that I will be receiving in about four to six weeks, and
can spare about 2,000 of it for another one.  I would like the list opinion
on what shape of 914 I can expect to find for that kind of money.  I'm
pretty flexible as long as there is no major engine, transmission or
structural rust problems.  Am I asking to much?  
	I live in the Kansas City area and wouldn't mind traveling too far for one. 
TIA
Brad
