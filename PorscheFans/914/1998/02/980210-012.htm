Hey Dave (and all)-

I am glad you think so highly of early 912's!
I am just starting restoration on my 68 gray market 912 softback.  (3rd.
owner) It has minimal rust, needs a new window, top and paint, as well as
a little top end motor work, but everything is original and there!  And
believe me, having all the parts is the hardest part.  Hopefully when I
get into the head it will just be a simple valve job.  It's a long story,
but basically I got the car for free!  They had a problem passing a gray
market car thru smog, and because of that they couldn't get it
registered, the fees and penalties piled up and up.  They gave me the car
to restore, I pay for the penalties, fees, and smog.  As you all know,
smog for the older cars in CA is no longer, and as for the penalties,
DMV's computer flushes any file that hasn't been active in 4 years, so
there was no penalties or fees other than registering the car as a gift! 
WOW!  But before I can start work on this car, I have to get my 914 back
on the road.

BTW: I am waiting for Mark Stephens to deliver my rebuilt head (2.0)
should be any day now.  I asked the list a while back where to send it
and the overall consensus was MSHP, so off it went.  I was originally
concerned about a crack between the two valve seats but they said it
checked ok.  I did have some radial cracking around the plug hole which
they fixed with TimeSerts, replaced ALL valve seats and a general valve
job.  The cost, $353.00 with tax and shipping and a set of new injector O
rings and cylinder shims.  The heads came off a 2.0 motor I had just
bought and had a recent valve job.  It looked ok to me except for the
apparent crack that wasn't.  So far, I have to say I have been pleased
with their customer service.  I know someone had a bad experience with
their head but got it corrected.  When I'm done, I'll put together a
complete report on MSHP and post it for all.
Next project, lighten the flywheel...
