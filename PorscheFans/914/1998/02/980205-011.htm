Some of you are probably looking at a car that needs
a hole fixed in a panel or structure.  Some of you are
wondering whether to replace the whole part or just
what to do.
Well, I've been there, and I've done that.
Read on for a moment and I'll share what I can with you.

For instance, the driver or passenger side wheelwell
down low has a rusy hole in it where the grit coming off the
front tire hits it.  It looks like it has been sandblasted or
shotgunned until a hole big enought to stick a shoe in
formed. What do you do?

In this case, the hole usually forms between the
longitudinal clamshells and is probably letting in
all sorts of stuff that will just destroy the structure.
This is a priority repair. .

Patching this is not as difficult as you think, and
you wont have to lay out big bucks for a part from
your friendly supplier.
Here's how:

1) Begin by rotary scotchbriting around the periphery
of the rusted hole, clean off at least 25mm from the
rim of the hole all around, and the curved flange below.

2) Take a spotweld cutter and center punch, and locate
each spotweld along the curved flange and put a dimple
in the center of each spot.

3) Use the cutter to liberate each spot from the underlying
metal flange, being careful not to cut too deeply.
Take a 1mm cutting wheel in an air angle die grinder and
cut a roughly square chunk out of the wheelwell, being sure
to encompass the rusty hole by at least 10mm and stopping
at the lower flange.  Cut the flange flush to the underside of
the structure, but dont cut into the panel from below.

4) Remove the offending chunk, and examine the back side to
see if you got all the rust affected metal, if not cut a larger
opening until you get to clean metal.  It is actually better to
oversize your initial cut to ensure you get all the cancered
metal in one shot.  Grind off spotweld slugs on car's flange.

5) Use the chunk you removed to pattern the replacement.
(steps (f) and (g) are most difficult part of this job)
a) use a flexible scale to measure the dimensions of the part.
b) make a drawing of the part in flat perspective. (be precise)
c) allow extra for later trimming.  (be imprecise)
d) cut a piece from flat sheet of similar thickness, 21Ga. steel
(usually 1.5mm) and of proper dimensions w/allowance.
e) use a bending brake, vice grips, etc.  to form lower flange 'Z'.
f) where the flange is, cut pie-shaped bits out to allow the
flat with flange to be curved to contour shape of pattern chunk.
g) hold part in curve and MIG weld flange cuts into solid flange.
h) use grinder to grind down welds into thin panel.
i) re-Mig the welds where holes formed from step (h).
j) repeat step (h) and (i) until flange is complete.
k) compare new part with old chunk and hole in car.
L) redo from (d) if not correct.
m) drill spotweld holes in flange for 'rosettes'.
n) Mig new part in using 'headbolt torque sequence' technique.
o) Rosette weld holes in flange.
p) coat area with appropriate colors and undercoating.
