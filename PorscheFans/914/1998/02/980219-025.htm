Yipee!

	Man it's been too long. I finally got my 914 out from under its
blanket, brushed off the snow, and fired 'er up! It took about 20-30
seconds of the starter groaning away, but it caught and fired right up!

	Back out on the road after almost 2 months. Ya know, the quattro is a
nice car, and it handles well. But the 914! Yahoo! The new steering
wheel pretty much obscures the instruments at this point, but I had
rotated them to supply my important vital track info. Like shifting
time, and the little glimpse down to see how fast I might actually be
going. Without incriminating myself too much, I actually _saw_ the
speedometer needle on my way down the canyon road. Let's just say that I
shouldn't be able to see the needle unless I'm on the track. :) :) By
the way, the canyon I live on is _not_ a highway or interstate, it's
definately considered a 'back road'. 

	Oh it's been far too long. All you other snow bounders out there. If
there's even a mildly warm day, and the roads look decent, take baby out
for a ride!

:) :) :) :) :)
