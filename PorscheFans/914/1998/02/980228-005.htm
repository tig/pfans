Hi all, Just wrapping up from our first tech session here. I think
everyone who came would agree that it was worth the time & effort to come.
Dave Wenger was extremely generous in loaning the use of his shop, The
Northend Wrench, as well in sharing with us his technical expertise. The
subject of this meeting was clutches. We had Bob Brealey's '74 2.0 for the
training aid. Bob had had slipping for a while, then the clutch just drop
to the floor with a bang one day. We dropped the trans, replaced the
clutch/pressure plate/ throwout bearing combo. The rear seal was the
culprit for the slipping so that was replaced. Bob's ordering some shifter
bushings to get rid of the slop so we are holding off wrapping things up
bottom-side until he gets the parts on Tuesday. 

Those of you who know the 914 clutch know this did not solve all his
problems. The clutch tube is also broken inside the center, so a stack of
washers are going on the adjuster until another tech session.

The Pelican Parts web site was an excellent source of info for this
meeting. Everything in their tech info on clutch replacement was right on
the money for this job.

People who attended ranged from seasoned pro to complete novice. Everyone
had turns holding lights, turning wrenches, holding stuff, bracing things
and offering words of wisdom and encouragement. I taped the whole thing so
after I get it edited down to 1 tape, I'll offer copies to whoever wants
one at cost. 

Everyone there agreed we should continue this. I would encourage others
out there to do the same. If your PCA region is like most, there's a large
silent majority out there, a lot of them aren't into racing, don't want to
attend social events, and would love to learn more about their cars. I'm
sure your would have no trouble putting on your own local meeting.

Frank Miller
