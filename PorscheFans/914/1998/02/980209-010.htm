	From what I've read, the difference in "hard parts" is just about
nil.  The cam grind may even be the same--though I'm not sure about that.
	The real differences lie outside the engine itself.  The 912E uses
its own EFI; a version of the L-jet was made just for it.  (There are
several parts that are unique to the 912E--good luck in finding them!!!)
The exhaust, of course, is very different--the engine is mounted the other
way around.  Some were equipped with ALL the smog crap you can think of--
smog pumps, AND thermal reactors, AND catalytic converters.
	The 912E motor is rated at 90 HP, versus the 914/2.0's rating of
95 HP.  I don't know which version of the 912E was tested for that number,
whether it had all of the smog stuff on it or not.  I do know that the
later 914/2.0, with the revised exhaust, was only rated at 88 HP.

	Very cute.  Lightweight--about as light as a 914.  Good balance--
almost as good as a 914.  A rev-happy, peaky 90 HP motor (1600cc four).
Very very expensive to fix major parts of.  The body is all 911 (except
for some motor mounting hard points), so you pay SWB [Short Wheel Base;
up through 68] 911 prices.  Softback targas are pretty darn rare--they
were the only Porsche convertible in 67 and 68, and were one of two 69
(with the later-style Targa as the other convertible option).  The 356-
based motor can easily be VERY expensive to overhaul correctly.  You
think it's hard to find 914/2.0 heads in good shape?  Try finding 356SC/
912 heads!  One mechanic told me that he put $10K into a 356 motor,
including his own time.  Fortunately, it was his own car.  Of course, I
know another person who says that he's been able to overhaul several 356
motors for just over $1K--NOT counting his own time.
	I like 912s.  I'm currently trying to talk a friend into finding
another original-type motor for hers.  She is talking about replacing her
last-legs stock motor with an early 911 one...  I have thought long and
hard about buying two different 912s that I have seen for sale.  But I
just can't justify another older (these are now 30+!) German sports car.
No garage space for it, either.   8^(
