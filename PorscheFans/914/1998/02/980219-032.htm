	I'll try to shed a little extra light on Dan Freeman's explanation.

>	Specifically, I would like to know exactly how you put your foot
>(like \, like /, or like I). Also, at which point to you actually perform
>the shift. Do you keep downshifting through the braking process or do you
>go to neutral for a while and then just find the right gear when you need
>it?

	The general sequence from my autoXing experience is:
	Throttle floored, screaming up to braking point.
	Brake HARD.  Threshold brake--that is, keep the brakes JUST before
locking up.  Continue braking through the next several steps:
	Grab gearshift lever, clutch in, pull to neutral.  (Quickly!)
	While keeping the ball of your foot (just aft of the big toe) on
the brake pedal, swing your heel over to the right a bit.  Roll your foot
to the right, so that the right edge of your foot presses the throttle.
Rev the motor to some approximation of the right RPMs for second gear at
this speed.  (I've never downshifted into any other gear at an autoX.  Not
in a 914, I haven't!!)
	Move gearshift lever, let out clutch, slide ball of foot off of
brake pedal, push gas pedal to floor.

	Some where during all of this sequence, you also have to start your
turn-in.  I usually do it in the middle of the last step, right about the
time that my foot leaves the brake pedal.  I don't trail-brake (keep on the
brake pedal while starting to turn), though perhaps I should learn.
	I do add an additional step to this procedure, just after the "Grab
gearshift lever" one.  I double-clutch--that is, I use heel-and-toe to blip
the throttle while the gearshift is in neutral, and quickly let the clutch
pedal most of the way out and then push it back in again.  I wind up having
to blip the accelerator twice this way, but I do know some people only hit
it once while still double-clutching.

	I have wide feet, so I can get away with the "roll your foot" tech-
nique.  Some people have to really swing their heel over quite far (to \ or
even - ) to push the throttle in.  That can get hard on your knees.

	This whole process goes pretty quickly, and must be practiced so
that you don't have to think about it.

	Oh, I am told by the local time-trialers that you don't go through
each gear as you slow down--you hang onto the higher gear until you want
to start accelerating, then you get into the proper gear for that speed.

	I hope this makes sense.
