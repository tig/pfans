	Last month, I took a trip down to the LA area to visit some
family.  I decided that I would take the 914, partly so I could see
how it (and I) reacted to *serious* long-distance driving.
	The reports are mostly good.  About 2 hours into my trip, I
started doubting my ability to make it all the way down.  I was all
stiff and sore, and not enjoying myself.  At the first rest stop, I
decided that it might be a good idea to actually use a seat-bottom
cushion, so I swapped one over from the passenger seat.  A world of
difference--I knew I could make it.  I also decided that having the
roof on the car was the way to go--it was TOO LOUD and TOO COLD with
it off.
	The run down I-5 was lengthy, and not all that interesting.
I did, however, take the opportunity to experiment a little bit.
(For any law enforcment authorities who are reading this: I am lying,
just boasting to impress my friends.  All numbers, etc., are the
results of extrapolating my STRICTLY LEGAL driving speeds...)
	However, I have determined that my 914 will exceed the max-
imum rated speed for the car.  If I remember correctly, the listed
maximum was 115 MPH.  For a short stretch, I took the car up to the
redline in 5th--which is 120 MPH.  It was still pulling, but very
very slowly.  I think that it might have made it all the way up to
the rev-limiter, which I think is somewhere in the neighborhood of
6200 RPM.  (Craig Strain--on your 130 MPH jaunt, were you over the
redline?)
	The trip back up was also an adventursome time.  I got some
CHEAP gasoline at Marina Del Rey on my way out of town.  Commute
traffic (and some caution) slowed me down a lot up through the
Grapevine, and all the non-I-5 driving was also slower than my aver-
age.  My odometer tells me 405 miles from the gas station to my work,
and the trip took almost exactly five hours.  I made the stretch from
the bottom of the Grapevine to Los Banos in about 2 1/2 hours.  Oh,
that is almost 250 miles, BTW.  ;^)
	I found out that my speedometer, which is rather optimistic
at lower speeds (due to my low-profile tires, it reads 40 at 35 MPH),
is actually fairly accurate up toward the top end.  At an indicated
average of about 90, it took me just about 15 minutes to do the final
21 miles of I-5 up to Los Banos.  ("Holy ****!  You mean I really
*was* going that fast?!?!?!")
	The car didn't mind the extended high-speed cruise, although
the constant 4500 RPM sound did get a little old after a while.  The
temp gauge went up higher than it usually does, but didn't appear to
be excessive.  (I've *got* to get a numbered gauge sometime!!)  Drop-
ping down to 80 brought the temps back to the normal range, as I
discovered on Highway 85.
	All in all, the car performed quite well.  The idle and low-
RPM behavior is still occasionally a bit off (it stumbles sometimes),
but the rest of the time it just GOES!
	I saw five cops on the way north on I-5.  Four were southbound,
and the one who was on my side of the road was already writing someone
else a ticket!  Gee, maybe my automotive luck isn't *all* bad!

	On my way south, I stopped in at Jim Thorusen's.  It was good
to meet him, and put a face to the name.  I also got to see and drive
Jim's white car.  It was a bit of an adventure--has your daughter got
the heater ducting painted yet, Jim?   ;^)   Jim's a very nice guy,
BTW.  I also got to see the garage, the spare motor, and some of the
pieces that he's taken apart to see how they work.  (No *wonder* I
like him!)
	The 914 is being put together for his daughter when she turns
16.  Now *that* is going to be dangerous--a very cute 16-year-old
blonde California girl in an open-topped Porsche!  Lock up the boys
right now!   ;^)

	Enough ramblings for now.  My apologies to all the other SoCal
914'ers that I missed.  My time and energy were pretty limited.  Maybe
next trip down, or if any of you come up north.  (Like, say, to the
Monterey Historics?)
