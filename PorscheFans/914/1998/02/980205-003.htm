Anyone know if the rev limiter rotor  has this resistor.  I've got a
Jacob's Omnipak I plan to use, has no rev limitor of its own built in, and
I'm trying to decide whether to keep the rev limiter rotor.

Simple:  Go to your local FLAPS (Kragan, Grand Auto, PEP Boys), and get
a (cheap) Bosch kit for any type-IV Volkswagen.
Do NOT let them look it up in their computer!  They WILL find the wrong
part.  (If they insist, tell them you have a 1978 VW bus with FI.)
