	I think that JJ can tell you a lot about exactly how an air
pump (AKA "Smog Pump") is set-up on a 914...
	The smog pump was added to some (but not necessarily all)
914s for the 75 and 76 model years.  What the pump does is push
fresh air into the exhaust ports in the heads.  This has several
effects.
	The nominal effect on air pollution is that the oxygen in
the fresh incoming air is supposed to help more completely burn the
unburned fuel in the exhaust, and also supposed to keep the HCs and
COs reacting into less harmful chemicals.
	One effect the smog pump has is to dilute the exhuast--so
that tests that measure a %age of CO, or PPM (Parts Per Million) of
HCs, read lower.  You used to have a certain amount of exhuast gases
coming out of the tailpipe at idle.  With the pump, you've got a
larger amount of gases coming out, but the same amount of pollutants.
So the pullutants are diluted by the extra fresh air.
	Another effect is on the running of the engine.  It takes
power to run the pump.  I don't know how much, but you might be sur-
prised at how much power it really takes.  Obviously, this is not a
good thing.
	Finally, pushing air into the exhuast ports gives you in-
stant backpressure in the exhuast.  Part of the idea behind the
exhuast system on a car is to get the exhaust gases away from the
motor and out of the car.  Obviously shoving more gases in just where
the gases are exiting the engine is going to interfere with this.  So
this also robs some power.

	So, is that a good enough answer?  (I'm sure that someone
will jump in and correct me if I've gotten any of this wrong...)
