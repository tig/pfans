Dirk mumbled:
>Sorry, wrongo. Teflon tape is for tapered threaded pipe fittings. PVC and

Could be worse- several years back I was rebuilding the engine in my Suzuki
Samurai.  I asked the parts guy for an oilpan gasket.  He handed me a tube
of
blue RTV silicone.  After checking around, I learned that that *is* the
factory
gasket.  Hell, I had a friend in high school who was *years* ahead of his
time-
and we just thought he was being cheap!
