I've always heard that 912E's were notorious for "torching" heads with
their thermal reactors, which makes me nervous since my
not-yet-installed '76 914 motor which I rebuilt the top end on has, I
believe, heads of 912E origin. (Heads were acquired after I dropped a
seat or two on the original heads). I don't feel that the problem with
dropped seats has so much to do with how far you can grind the seats
down, but rather that the surrounding cast aluminum at some point turns
to mush after you expose it to great heat for long periods of time. In
fact I am not aware of any adverse effects of grinding valve seats. All
you metallurgy guys, what are your thoughts about this?
