An earlier list post said there must be 3 or 4 AA fans on list.
Won't the other 2 or 3 join me in shouting TO THE LIST:

I AM A FAN OF DR914, GEORGE HUSSEY, AUTO ATLANTA, THE AUTO ATLANTA STAFF AND
I AM EXTREMELY PROUD TO SAY SO.

Naturally, I think more than 2 or 3 should respond.

There are very limited suppliers for the 914. To bash ANY is stupid.

Question. Have you ever bought anything from AA? AA catalog says in very
simple language what their policies are. If you don't approve, why did you
shop there.

When I need parts and have the money, I usually buy from AA. When I do, I
understand their policy on purchases, shipping & returned good.

I have also bought from other suppliers. I find what their policy is before
buying from them as well as their prices and shipping costs. If it is not
what I want to deal with, then I simply go to someplace else.

See how simple it is. Even I, Mike Cooley, can understand.

George Hussey is a friend of mine but I have never met George in person. 
How can he be my friend? He treated me as I wanted to be treated and I
treated him the same. Think about it, he is also the friend of most of the
rest of you. He provides you and me with the maximum choice of good 914
parts. New or used. If I think the price is too high for a needed part, I
don't start bashing AA. I just look and maybe buy somewhere else.
 
The same is true for the other suppliers I will assure you.

There are some users on this list who seem to think that every thing that
they post is decreed as gospel. Wrong! 
Think for yourself. Thats why the rest of us are a unique individual, a 914
owner and user member of this list.
 
Flame me if it will make you feel better. Use Private e-mail only. Words
have never hurt me in my entire life. Besides, I am cold and maybe it would
warm me up. :-)
