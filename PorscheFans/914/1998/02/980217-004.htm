I have a '70 914 w/carb, 009 distributor w/ centrifugal advance, and points ignigion.



This year, I would really like to get rid of the points.  I've heard a lot about
the electronic ignition systems available, but am still in the dark about how they
work, and what would be a good one to get for the $$ I have to spend.



I know that these things are no big deal to set up...but how do they work?  Do the
points remain in the distributor, and become inoperatable?  Do they have to come
out?  I know the Petronix one goes inside the distributor.  This unit seems to be
ideal for retaining "stock" appearance and performance.  My car is for track, and
apperance is no issue, and I was hoping for a "bigger spark", so I was thinking to
spend a little more money ($100-140) on an external unit.  



Any recommendations, or used items to sell??



Thanks

Sam Matthews
