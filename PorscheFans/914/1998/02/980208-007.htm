Is there an aftermarket alternative for fuel pump replacement?  I was
driving my car Saturday stopped for lunch and when I went to start the
car I did not hear the pump come on.  I turned the key and the starter
would not kick over either.  All grounds are clean and tight. I was able
to push start the car and it has run perfectly ever since. I have owned
this car for three years and have had absolutely no problems with it of
any kind.  Can anyone shed a little light on what could have been the
problem.  No fuses or relays were blown, and no other systems other than
the fuel pump and starter failed to operate. Thanks ahead of time,
Steve.
