Kyle, 
Thanks for posting the 914 floorpan replacement part 1 and 2. They are very
valuable pieces of information that all 914 owners can gain a lot of insight
from. Especially me. A die hard do-it-your-self. Money prevails.

I had the same opinion as you about some of the tech sessions that I had
attended. One in particular was fuel injecting tech meeting. I am not fluent
in any language including our own. The speaker at the session spoke German
half of the time. I was not aware if he was discussing FI or just ticking
away the clock which lasted about 4 hours. He answered a few questions that
were asked and then he left immediately. If not for the literature, I would
have been just as much in the dark as when I arrived. 

I did learn that FI is extremely reliable and you don't fool with it without
just cause and the proper testing equipment. I did understand enough of one
thing in particular, most problems are those that the owners create
themselves by tinkering with something that was operating properly before
they started tinkering and not changing filters as needed.
 
I have a hand scanner, Logitech black and white that is just a couple of
months old. Will that work for you? Sorry I can't afford a full page color
scanner, but it is yours if it will do what you want. Just say the word and
it will be on its way. You will need to install the scanner card into an ISA
slot on your computer. Software is included.
