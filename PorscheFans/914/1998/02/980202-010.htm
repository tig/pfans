	Yes, you do go through the hole in the trailing arm.
	The first thing is to get the cover off of the adjuster.  The stock
jobbies are (evidently) plastic things with allen heads (???).  Metal hex-
headed ones are available aftermarket.  Mine had SOMETHING or another with
an M6 bolt JB-Welded onto it, so I needed a 10mm socket to pull it out.
Very funky.  Feel for the end of the plug, if you can.  If not, a mirror and
a flashlight may help you see the end.  If you're lucky...
	I was trying a 13mm socket on it for a while, then realized that the
socket was going in farther than the end of the bolt--it was just too big
to grip the nut...  Hours of fun, that.   B^(
	Behind the plug is an Allen screw that you turn with an Allen wrench
or socket on a long extension.  I believe that the inner adjuster has a jam-
nut on it just like the outer one, but I am not certain about that.  Anway,
you poke around in there until you get the Allen wrench to bite, then turn
just like the outer adjuster.
	Good luck!
