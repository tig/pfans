	I've heard about that from the other side, as well.  I think it
was Larry Reynolds of Car Care Specialties, that gave us all a lesson in
"Shipping 101" a few years ago.
	I think the final lesson was that the shipping charges passed on
to the customer are often *less* than what it actually costs the supplier
to get the product out the door and to the consumer.  That factors in a
lot of things, like the man-hours required to do the packing and deal with
the shipping company, as well as the actual fee that the supplier gets
charged by that company.
	Maybe it would be more "honest" to factor all of that into the
base price of the products offered.  But of course, that would unfairly
penalize someone who came in and picked up the item in person.

	This is just to give you some appreciation about why shipping
charges can appear so high sometimes.  Of course, I can understand some
frustration at those charges--I went a fair bit out of my way to avoid a $5
shipping charge on four 50-cent screws last year.  (Ya see, it doesn't
count as hypocracy if I tell you about it myself...  ;^)
