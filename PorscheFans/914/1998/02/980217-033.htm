	Nope, not minority at all!  Well, not a minority of one.  I am
pretty gung-ho on the FI issue, if you didn't notice.  Dirk Wright believes
that the D-jet FI in particular (1.7 and 2.0) is too complex and has too
many pieces NLA, so he prefers carbs.  And I take every opportunity to
tease him about it--don't I, Dirk?

	If you mean do you have to have the switch in the M/C hooked up so
that the brake light will flash, no you don't.  If one circuit of your
brakes fails, you will know it RIGHT AWAY.  The pedal will go to the floor,
and you will slow down much less than you should.  The big red blinking
light (or small one, in a few cars) won't do anything more than tell you
*why* you need to change your shorts after you have stopped the car.  Of
course, it is not exactly a bad idea to have it hooked up, because at least
you do have some idea what happened afterwards.
	If you mean, should you hit the button on the M/C after you bleed
your brakes, then yes you should.  That way you avoid having that annoying
red light blinking all the time the ignition is on.  If it's always going,
then you have no idea if your e-brake is still on, or if one of your two
brake circuits has failed, or...  And you get a constant clicking noise
that is too quiet to hear at speed, but will DRIVE YOU INSANE if you have
to sit at idle for too long.  (BT,DT.)

	Of course, case 1 presumes that all losses of brake fluid pressure
happen when you press on the pedal.  This is probably not quite always the
case, but I'd bet it's close enough.
	And I personally would (and do) keep the switch hooked up.  I
always forget to reset it after bleeding the brakes, but I can now press
the button from the outside, in the rain, while wearing dress clothes, in
5 seconds.
