Oh man JJ, that's bites. Sounds like you must have caught it from your
car. :)

Yes, that's a lean hunt. Usually caused by a vacuum leak in the intake
plumbing somewhere.

And is probably running really rich! Operating temperature should yield
only a couple hundred ohms, not thousand. The resistance of the HTS
drops as it heats up and will range from about 2.5k ohms cold to about
100-200 ohms when warm. If you had to crank up the pot to that high a
level to get the engine to run at normal temperatures, then you probably
have big leak in the intake plumbing somewhere. What you're doing is
fooling the brain into thinking that the engine is actually very cold
and the ECU compensates by running rich. The extreme of this situation
is an open circuit on the HTS which will force the ECU to go to full
rich and consequently flood the engine. Ask me how I know... :)

That seems like a very rich running condition to me.

Yup, first off make sure that your Auxiliary Air Regulator is working.
Make sure that the cold start valve (if you have one) is functioning
properly (turning off when it should) and that it's not leaking. After
that, the regular leak check routine on a D-jet car. Get a can of brake
cleaner or carb starter fluid and start spraying it in small controlled
bursts on any joints that could be responsible for vacuum leaks. The
intake runner to head interface is a common source of frustrating vacuum
leaks. The 'socks' that join the intake runners to the plenum are
another possible problem place. But don't worry, there's _lots_ of other
places to check too. :)
