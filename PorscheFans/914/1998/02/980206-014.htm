I was looking through a copy of 'Design News' and came across
a Dupont-Dow ad for Viton, and this got me to thinking, so I logged
onto their website to check on this material.  <www.dupont-dow.com>
I have a set of Viton O-rings for my pushrod seals and was curious
as to the engineering data supporting this material, and exactly
which grade it is.  There are 7 different grades of Viton, starting
with type 'A' and ending with type 'GFLT'.  They span a capability
in temperature range and resistance to hot and cold, oils and
chemicals.
This further piqued my curiosity as to what type of temperatures
a typical 914 cylinder head, engine case and pushrod tube sees
during the seasons and extremes of a year.

Anybody got any data for this.
 -if I get none, I will thermocouple up my rod when I get it going
again, and produce some data.

The Viton 'A' type is good up to 200'C (400'F), but I dont know
about its low temperature performance. . .
