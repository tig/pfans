Bill,

    The interest to go to wider wheels is not for looks, it's to reduce
sidewall flex. In autoxing and road racing, the lateral loads placed on
race tires is extreem, and the causes significant sidewall flex which
results in softer turn-in, and decreased response. Even with the BFG R1
with it's radically stiff sidewalls, the wider the wheel the better.  At
the limit, the difference between a narrow rim and wide rim is very
noticable. As far as rolling resistance, a wider wheel won't change that,
wider tire yes, but the wheel won't effect that.
