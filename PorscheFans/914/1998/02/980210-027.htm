For Dave D. ;  cc PorscheFans-914.

Hi Dave!

I've gotten into the busy loop again, and haven't had a chance to
catch up on my E-mail...   anyway I thought that I'd write a reply
note.

   It was good to meet you too, and to get your test pilot report on
our 914.   

(For Josh Hadler:  The brake pedal feel is good, so I must have bled
it right, but the braking effectiveness is less than Dave expected; 
perhaps the effect of not turning excessively rusty disks?)

>  --has your daughter got
> the heater ducting painted yet, Jim?   ;^) 

   No, the ducting is still sitting bare in a box; we have been
spending time trying to get various grades improved to the point
where we can afford to insure her...  I am dusting off my Euclidian
plane geometry that I haven't used since high school...

>  Jim's a very nice guy, BTW.  

   Ah shucks, I think Dave's the nice guy... he let me drive HIS 914,
and didn't get appoplexic when I missed a shift, getting 4th instead
of second.   This is something I'm somewhat prone to do, and is
embarassing even when I'm by myself, but to do it in front of Dave,
and in his car... well, Dave is a patient and pleasant sort.

   Which brings me to a question:   Isn't there an after-market
helper spring that one can install into the shift linkage to make the
second-third gate more positive?   I seem to remember once reading
about such a thing, but now I can't recall where I saw it.   Am I
hallucinating again, or is there really such a thing? And if so,
where can I find one?

   I have followed the thread about a tech tips web page with
interest, and I am willing to contribute anything that the site
manager would find useful, but I recall an old saying to the effect
that one picture is worth 1000 words.  If I can ever find the bucks,
I would like to get video capture capability for my computer, and
digitize some pictures of things like the dissassembled items Dave
mentions, and the rear caliper overhaul, for example.   If someone
has the capability to provide and manage a site with the amount of
disk space that this implies,  I would think that eventually we could
compile an on-line "shop manual", with more practical info than even
the factory books.
   To see what something like this might look like, check out:

   Actually, she is already 17, but she has insufficient time behind
the wheel for two reasons: grades, and the fact that I'm scared to
ride with her.   I mean, in most cars, the passenger / instructor can
at least reach the handbrake, but not in the 914!   Does anyone know
where I can get one of those mickey-mouse little add-on cable
operated foot pedals that you see in "dual-control" driver training
cars, and have a good suggestion as to how to graft it on to the 914
without ruining the car?

   One other thing, Dave, regarding our conversation about valves.  
Do you have the Publication "How to Rebuild Your Volkswagen
Air-Cooled Engine", by Tom Wilson?   On page 96, there is a good
picture of a typical cam with various areas of the geometry defined,
and on page 97, is an acompanying description of how to measure lift.
  In this discussion, there is a caution that the actual lift cannot
be measured; only the relative lift (comparison between lobes)
because the "base circle" cannot be accurately established.   This is
because the only points available for such a measurement are on the
sides of the lobe, and the "ramp" has already probably started.   
   You need to read Tom's explanation together with his picture, but
unless Porsche wants us to establish valve clearance with the lifter
on the ramp, rather than on the base circle (a practice that I have
never heard of before in any other car), the correct point to measure
valve clearance is with the opposite valve rocking, and not TDC with
both valves closed.   If I interpret the text correctly, the valve
clearance will be greater if set using the TDC method than if set
using the opposite valve rocking technique.   This is not a problem
per se, but the start of the ramp where the clearance is minimal is a
very small part of the cam surface, and it is not likely that you
would get consistant results without a degree wheel on the crank for
reference.   The base circle, on the other hand, comprises the
largest single portion of the cam's surface, and as such, is the
easiest place to get consistant results.

> Maybe next trip down, or if any of you come up north.  (Like, say,
to the
> Monterey Historics?)

   I would like to get to the Monterey Hysterics, but I have a
difficulty:   I would have to continue on from there to Oregon for
the rest of my vacation (the wife's folks live in Portland) and I
don't trust the 914 to go that far.  (Or my neck either... my busted
disk won't let me drive a 914 for hours at a time.)   So... I would
need a 914 baby-sitter; someone in the Bay area that would keep an
eye on the lil' critter for about three weeks while I continued on to
Portland and back in the family minivan.  Any takers?   (I suppose I
could show up without the car, but that wouldn't be nearly as much
fun.)
