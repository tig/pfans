<<Hello all,
Quick question. Anyone successful at removing small dent from a front 914
chrome bumper? Circa 1970 is my ride when saddle condition is worthy of a
gallup.>>

Hi Mike,
I've removed dents from lots of bumpers, including my 914. The best way to do
this is to remove the bumper from the car. Take off the bumper guards and
license plate and frame. Now lay it face down on an old blanket or towels. You
want to protect the chrome from scratches or more dents. On the backside,
locate the dents. A good method is to rub a sanding block across the dents, on
the inside of the bumper, this will polish the high spots and make them
visible.
Now take a hammer, use one with a good smooth face, and a block of wood,hard
wood like oak is good if you have a piece handy. I use a piece approximately 1
inch thick by 2 inches wide. The wood will distibute the load and soften the
hammer blows, this will prevent sharp creases and will not cause the chrome to
crack or flake.Place the wood on the high spot and start tapping. Don't go
crazy, but you will need to use a good amount of force. Turnover and check
your progress often. Do this until the surface feels smooth . When you are
done spray some primer and paint on the bare metal inside your bumper. Now
clean and polish the chrome side. Put it all back together, get a beer and a
milk crate, sit down and admire your work.

Good luck,
Ed Villela
