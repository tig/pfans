     Drove to work in the storms last week with the obligatory beach towel 
     to wipe down all the windows every two minutes in order to see.  As 
     near as I can see, my defrost works as designed, but is oh so 
     inadequate.  My blower in the engine compartment for the heating 
     system works, as does the one in the dash (well, it at least makes 
     alot of noise).
     
     Has anyone come up with a real world defrost for the 914???
     
     I'm willing to modify or repair, the dash-blower "screams" every once 
     in a while as though it bearings had no lube. (somehow I doubt that 
     this would make a difference)
     
     
     I'm slipping an '83 3.0 SC engine into the bay once I dig up enough 
     loot to buy all the ancilliaries, with that I want to put in an A/C 
     system if only to use as a source of Dry Air for the defrost.
     
     Right now I'm stuck with the '76 2.0 arrangement, no heater elements 
     in rear glass.  Any suggestions????
     
     Thanks,
