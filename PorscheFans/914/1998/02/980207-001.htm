Hey Dave Darling, if you had one of my "Umbrella Covers" you wouldn't need a
bilge pump.  Been there, done that, came up with a solution!  Call
901.847.9146 for more info.

I used to be a big fan of Automobile Atlanta.  Without a doubt, George Hussy
knows as much about the 914 as anyone, although he's not the only one with
that wealth of 914 expertise.  George has in the past, given me excellent free
advise, and I used to call just to chat 914.  My opinion changed when I
purchased a car from AA, and found rust problems.  My personal decision to
discontinue trade with AA, has brought me to start my own 914 business; 914
Network.  Very small right now, and definately don't have everything,
including attitude.

Admittedly I do not have all the technical knowledge to warrant personal
claims of a doctorate in 914'ism, then again I have check valves for my ego.
If anyone ever has any problems with anything purchased from 914 Network, we
will do whatever possible to satisfy.  I would be concerend with so many
unhappy customers, and not be boasting of bad PR.  If I saw so many unhappy
customers bashing my other product or how we do business at Q-Snap Needlework
Frames, I'd be doing some major changes to correct the problems.

The bottom line with this forum, is that everyone has a right to voice an
opinion.  If you have a problem however, your first contact should be the
vendor.  You can't bash someone without providing them the chance to make
things right.  If after you have provided the vendor that chance, and they
choose not to correct the problem or provide a satisfactory resolution, the
consumers only recourse is a forum like this, as well as reporting to the
Better Business Bureau.  If you are going to make any major transactions, I'd
suggest contacting the BBB and see what the track record may be.  A nationally
advertised vendor has the benefit of magazine ads, slick catalogues, etc.
What does the consumer have to balance this?  This is the information age,
like it or not.  We as participants in the decimination of information have to
take it upon ourselves to form our own opinion based on our experiences, and
the experiences of trusted friends.  Opinions are
like.........................personalities, we all have one, and not everyone
may like it.
