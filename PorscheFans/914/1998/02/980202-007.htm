_Stock_ fenders? I don't think it'll work with the combo you're looking at. I
run 225/50s on 6 inch rims and they BARELY fit. I'm not kidding, that extra .2
inches cross-section you'll gain with the 1 inch wider rim may very likely be
too much.

As far as getting steel wheels widened? Just get a whole new set. Steel wheels
are pretty damn cheap. Custom steel wheels can be had for as little as
something like $60-$80 per wheel. And you'll probably have to pay like $50 per
to have a wheel widened.

It is something that you can do if you have patience and and good set of
instructions. Templates are key, if you don't have some kind of template (like
the Weltmeister plates), and aren't comfortable with pulling the gas tank and
all that (yes, the tank will need to come out), then maybe giving it to a pro
isn't a bad idea. Otto's does good work from what I hear, so that might be a
good place to try.
