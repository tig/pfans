Hi All,

         Didn't copy from poster who requested this info. Anyway, Oooh I
can answer this one
recently dealt with it myself:  Open the engine compartment and with an
open end wrench
reach in to the trunk and remove the bolts holding the lid. ( I didn't
do it this way and if
you choose to remove the torsion springs grab them with a pipe wrench
and rotate the out
of the way and you can remove the hinges..... much more difficult.)
Well, anyway you
can remove the bolts and lift the lid it will come up pretty high with
the lock intack.
If the cam on the back of the lock is broken (was my problem) you can
just find a way
to actuate the latch, it has a lever which pushes toward the front of
the car and is  on
the upper inside of the latch. Its easy to push once you find it.
Another way I heard mention
of was to unscrew the screw that hold the cam to the lock with a drill
bit by sticking it in
through the lock. Don't pull out the lock tumbler without a key in it or
you may have to
try to rekey it with the wafers that fell out.
            (Incidently "while I was in there" I made new flat metal
stop for my hinge assembly
since I already had it apart, abd replaced the pulleys with the brass
ones from Automotion.)

         You can get a new cam from Automotion if you need one. Hope
this helps.
