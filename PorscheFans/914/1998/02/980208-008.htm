Steve,

The next logical suspect would be the engine relay panel.

I had a '74 that would just stop every now and then.  I would take
a couple of relays out, switch them around, and it would run fine
for a while (week or so) longer.  Replaced the relay panel, and
it never died again.

I also had some gremlins disappear by replacing the fuse box.  I
inspected the fuse box after, couldn't see anything wrong, so I put
it back in.  The gremlins came right back.  (Weird turn signal
problems, that kind of stuff.)

My pet theory is that the spring contact both corrode, and loose their
spring with age, making the connections not quite good enough.

There is also a relay panel above the fuse box that deserves attention.
And if it's a '74 (and up???), the relay panel under the passenger seat.

Gary.
