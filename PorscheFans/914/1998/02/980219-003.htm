Umm guys, teflon tape is made for plumbing.  As in PVC, galvanized, copper,
you know that kind of plumbing, as in your basement or near your water heater.
Braided oil lines as referenced above are tapered seat fittings, and if you
need any kind of sealant your fittings are junk.  Using teflon tape in this
application is borrowing trouble.  If you need to use any type of thread
sealant for tapered threads, do yourself a favor and use Permatex Aviation
sealant, not teflon tape.  Leave the teflon tape to Bob Villa.

The correct item for the oil drain plug is the copper crush washers.
