Hi Mike...



I read your recent post "Weber setup".



I was wondering if I could tell you about my "unique" setup, and get your impression,
as you seem to have a really good understanding of carbs.



When I first bought my 914, it had been installed with a single carburator.  All
the hardware was originally from a kit manufactured by Beck Industries, back in the
80's.  It consisted of a Holley 5200 progressive carb, aluminum intake manifold (carb
bolts on to this), chrome intake tubes, centrifugal advance distributor with points,
coil, and maybe some other stuff.  The kit was intended for the VW bus (so maybe
you've heard of it).  The engine block is from a 1.7 with 96mm big bore kit from
NPR.



Someday (when $$$ allows) I would like to install a programmable electronic FI system,
but until that time, I would like to get the best out of what I have.   



I ran the car exactly like that for an entire season, and was not too happy with
it.  It seemed to me to have a very limited power band, and bogged really bad when
it got a little cool out.



This is the GM part….



As I decided keep the carb, I got a book or two on carburators.  As I read I started
to feel that a progressive carb is not what I want.  As I see it, a progressive carb
is never going to deliver a balanced amount of fuel to the 4 cylinders.  It's always
going to be rich on one side or another.  Then I started reading about some other
carbs, most of them being 4 barrels.  Then one article caught my eye.  The Rotchester
2G was a BIG two barrel carb made by GM that had almost the same bolt pattern as
my Holley.  It was built for many different types of V8s, trucks, busses, in the
70's.  The article outlined how these, with a little work, were quite capable of
producing a lot of power.  Well, if they're good enough for a V8, they should be
great for my tiny little 4-banger!!



I made my way down to the local U-pull-it, and found an old Chrysler with one of
these.  After disassembling the whole thing, installing a rebuild kit, and some very
minor alterations, I bolted it on right where the Holley used to be.  I tried to
order some jets, but it seems that these are going to be a major pain to find.  The
main jets are 60s, by the way.



After 10 min of cranking, and priming, it started right up.  And after some idle
screw and throttle adjustments it idled very nicely.  It seemed to rev really strong,
but did have a nice flat spot right off of idle.  Also, it would not take more than
a mere crack of the throttle plate to send the revs right up to red line.



Since the initial install, I've been driving it around, but only in the driveway.
 Soon I'll get it on the road.  I did pull the plugs, and they were, not suprizingly,
black and powdery.  I'm sure that I'm running rich, and that the carb is too big
for this engine, but I would really like to make it work.  The low end power was
really quirky, sometimes being no worse than the Holley, but other times bogging
out so bad that I couldn't even get the car to move.  The high end seemed nice, and
fast, and much better than it ever was. 



One thing I've wanted to do with my setup is get rid of the points ignition, and
replace it with an electronic ignition, and a big coil.  Now seems like a good time
to do that.  I know I'm running rich (but I don't know how rich), and I thought it
would be a good idea to burn as much of that gas as I can before I start trying to
track down jets.  I think it would also help the low end acceleration and keep the
plugs from fouling out when it's idling.  Right now I'm looking at the HI-6 / PS2
from CraneCams.



What would you do?



Thanks in advance
