Hi there everybody.  I've repaired the odometer on my 914 and my 356 
because both had the same problem.  The article on Tim's 914 site is a good 
description of what needs to be done.  I might add the following pointers:

- My 914 speedometer needed to have the speedo needle removed, which 
immediately decalibrates the gauge.  The gauge needs to be recalibrated 
when reassembled.  You could use a hand drill and a stop watch since you 
have the odometer to measure distance traveled.  Just rig the drill up to 
the input to the speedometer (you'll have to be slightly creative here), 
and run the drill so that the speedometer reads about 30 (or 15, some 
multiple of sixty).  Time how long it takes for the odometer to go 1 mile. 
 It should take 2 minutes at 30 mph, any quicker time means that your 
speedometer is reading low.

- The 356 gauges have more metal/durable parts in them if you can get a 
hold of a junk one and swap some gears.

-  While you have the face of the gauge off, replace the face with a glass 
one.  If you had plastic before, you will not believe the difference!!!

-  If you're careful, in addition to roughing the shaft, place the pot 
metal gear center section in a vise (or vise-grips) and deform the center 
into an oval.  Placing some epoxy on the shaft helps too.

This is on my list for a Pelican Tech article with color photos.  Keep 
watching our site for it to appear with all the other ones that are already 
up there...

Hope that these hints and tips help!

-Wayne
