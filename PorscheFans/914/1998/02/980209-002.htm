<<PS.  To Ed.  Dont let anyone tell you what you may and may not talk about on
this forum.  This forum is for everyones 2 cents.  Some people dont like what
they read in the news papers, but it is freedom of the press.   I love this
country!  And  personal examples of poor service are not bashing.>>

Thank You Chuck. My post, about a certain supplier whose name I will not
mention this time, obviously got out of hand. Most people missed the point.
This is last thing that I will say about it. (I've gotten over it.) The facts
are: 
1- I was given a price verbally by the sales person, that price is printed on
both reciepts. The supplier put it there, not me.
2- The mistake was the suppliers, not mine. The supplier says they never
quoted that price, even though it is printed on 2 of their reciepts.
3- The supplier never called and asked if it was okay for them to charge more
money to my credit card.
4- The price is not the issue, Its the way the supplier handled it.  (Suppose
you were at a parts counter, you're given a reciept for oh say $10, you hand
the sales person a ten. Then he comes back and opens your wallet and take out
another lets say $22) Get the point????

I agree that we need good suppliers for the 914's. I thank those companies
that devote their bussinesses to 914 perservation, But the customers are EVERY
BIT AS IMPORTANT as the 914s. The car does not buy the parts, we do. Companies
will not survive with out customers and 914s will not survive without the
suppliers. They go hand in hand. Customer satisfaction should be every
companies top priority. I feel this way about all of the suppliers we use. My
intent was to warn people of suppliers that may have poor business manners. I
thought that this was part of the purpose of this list. I was not trying to
sound like a cry baby!!

Thank you,
Ed Villela
P.S. Thanks to the list members, 18 to be exact, who wrote me privately with
similar experiences.
