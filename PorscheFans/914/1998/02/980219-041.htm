I think the resistor in the rotor serves basically the same purpose that 
the resistors in the plug wires and plugs do - to limit noise.  This 
noise can interfere with the radio but, more importantly, can play havoc 
with your car's ignition or fuel computer.  Now, I think it was JJ who 
says that the lack of a resistor was screwing up his car, but I don't 
think this was the real cause and the mechanic was problem blowing smoke 
on that point.  I doubt the L-jet or D-jet computer is affected by this 
and I know my car works fine with a resistor-less rotor.  It may be a 
more cumulative problem if your wires, plugs, and rotor had no reisitors, 
or if there were some ground problems.  If I am wrong and this is a 
problem, it might help to have noise filter inline for the power supply 
for the D-jet computer.
