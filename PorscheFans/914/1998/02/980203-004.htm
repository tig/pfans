     CB Performance sells all the Fuel Injection (based on late model GM 
     parts) and Turbocharger/Intercooler parts you would need to turbo the 
     Type IV 914 (and for that matter, any VW/4 cylinder Porsche) engine.
     
     Awesome web page at www.cbperformance.com
     
     While most their parts are geared toward Type 1 performance, they are 
     not cheap.  The difference between a Fuelinjected/Turboed Type IV, and 
     a 2.0/2.2/2.4/2.7 911 engine in good shape may be small or non- 
     existent.  You would have a lighter car however, and if you cool the 
     snot out of it with massive air/oil flow, keep the compression ratio 
     way down (low 7's), and behave yourself with the revs., this Type IV 
     may turn out to be a great, durable performer!
     
     An interesting alternative could be found in a turboed Water Boxer!
     Still pushrod, not quite type 1, not quite type IV, all VW!!!!!!
     
     Not smog/street legal in California "officially", but if your 71 914 
     1.7 litre is a CA car,  who will know except us??????
     
     
     Let us all know how it turns out.....
