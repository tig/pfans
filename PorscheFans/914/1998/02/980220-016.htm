	My goodness--I didn't mean to start a religious war on this
subject!  All I wanted to do was express my frustration with the
numbers of items packaged together in the sump kit.  (Kinda like
bitching about ten hot dogs in a pack, but only eight buns in a
pack.)
	The other thing I wanted to do was mention the size of the
drain washer.  Which I forgot to do--oops!
	Anyway, the size that I wound up buying (plug again:  from
Global Metrics in Belmont CA, locals should definitely look them up
for their fastener needs!) were "12x18x2".  They are very slightly
thicker than the washers from the kit--very slightly.  I'd bet they
are close enough, especially for the oil drain plug.

	To tell you the truth, I'd never considered Teflon tape on
the drain plug.  Just plain never occurred to me.  I think I saw
that my mechanic had put a crush washer on it, so I put the second
one from the kit on it.  (Then I discovered the kit supposedly had
two oil-changes worth of gaskets and washers in it.)
	I haven't seen any sealant of any kind on my transmission
plugs, nor have I used any.  I hope I don't come to grief because
of that.  Time will tell.

	Let's just relax, folks.  Go for a drive in the car, or
just go out and breathe in the (no doubt carcinogenic) smells of
the car:  Oil, gasoline, solvents--or if you're lucky, warm leather
or leatherette.  (You're blessed indeed if you don't have to smell
the other stuff!)
