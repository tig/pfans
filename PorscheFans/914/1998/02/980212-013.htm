	A question was asked in the Renegade Forum about the effects of the
17mm brake master cylinder versus the 19mm one.  At first, I tried to remem-
ber what little I could about the math behind it all.  Then I went to an
engineer friend of mine (who is into Porsches also).  He told me that I was
making the problem much more difficult than it had to be.  What follows is
the simple version.  [Boy, I love having smart friends!!]

Assumption:  We are interested in the braking force, the force exerted on
the brake rotors by the brake pads.  We won't take into account anything
having to do with tire dynamics, wheel lock-up, etc. for the moment.

Assumption:  The force exerted by the brake pads is equal to the force
exerted by the brake pistons onto the pads.

That force is generated by the pressure of the brake fluid on the inner face
of the piston.  The force (measured in pounds, say) is equal to the pressure
of the brake fluid in the caliper (measured in PSI, Pounds per Square Inch),
divided by the area of the inner face of the brake piston (as measured in
square inches).

Assume that the master cylinder is the only thing that changes in this
experiment.  Therefore, the area of the inner face of the brake piston does
not change.  So we can just concentrate on the pressure of the brake fluid.

Now, take it back to the beginning of the braking action:  To your foot.
You apply a certain force to the pedal with your foot.  Measure this force
in pounds; call it F.

The master cylinder (M/C) turns that force into a pressure.  Pressure is
measured in units of PSI, or Pounds per Square Inch.  The pressure in the
brake fluid is the product of the force F, and the area in square inches of
the piston.  If you do the math, you find that the area of the end of the
piston in the 17mm M/C is 0.8 times the area of that of the 19mm M/C.  The
math:
( (17/2)^2 / (19/2)^2 )  =  ( (8.5*8.5) / (9.5*9.5) )  =  ( 72.25 / 90.25 )
=  0.80055 and change.
[The constant PI is in there too, but on both sides of the division, so it
cancels itself out.]

Therefore, since the force F is the same between the two cases, the 17mm M/C
pressurizes the brake fluid (1 / 0.8) = 1.25 times as much as the 19mm one.
So for a given force, you get more stopping power--25% more.

Restating it, the 19mm M/C requires you to push the pedal 25% harder to get
the same braking force.  The pedal does not travel as far, and you are
pushing harder.  Therefore, the pedal "feels" harder.

	Effectively, what you have done is to reduce the amount of advantage
that you have over the brake pistons.  You have changed the gearing, or you
have changed the leverage you have.  You can get much the same effect by
making the lever that the brake pedal is on 80% of its own length--you have
to push harder, and the pedal travels less.
	So the 19mm M/C will change the feel of the brakes, but will not
improve their behavior unless the old M/C was faulty.
	Of course, if you have larger than stock brake pistons that you are
trying to move, then you need to push more fluid, and the larger M/C starts
to become the preferred option.
