Sorry all but I need to vent this one. Back in December I decide that I would
give AA another shot. It had been a couple of years since I last bought from
them, and I was under the impression that they HAD IMPROVED their business
manner. Anyhow I spoke to George himself, a fairly pleasant person, and
ordered some fuel injection parts. I ordered a vacum hose kit, George said
"the kit was $50", I said "I'll take one". I then asked for a set of 4 intake
boots, George said "it was $10 for the set", I said "I'll take one set". He
asked if I had their new catalog, I said no, he said no problem he would throw
one in. I was satisfied. The package arrived in a few days, I was impressed
because it used to take approx. 2 weeks to arrive in the past. When I opened
it, the reciept said that the intake boots were back ordered. There was no
catalog,the reciept said there was , but there wasn't. A few weeks later, I
called to check the status of the intake boots, still back ordered but will
ship as soon as they arrive. No mention of a price increase! So today the
intake boots show up. The reciept says "sorry Ed but the boots cost $8 each
and we have to charge you an additional $22". So I called right away and spoke
to Susan, I told her the situation and asked how to remedy it. Susan said the
price must have been misquoted, The price came from the owner of the company
for crying out loud!. So I pointed out that both of my reciepts show the price
as $2.50 each, $10 total. That did not seem to help. I asked to speak to
George, afterall he took the order and quoted the price.I never got to speak
to George, but Susan said that George said he NEVER quoted me that price.I
asked if that meant I was lying, they said nope, just that George never said
$10 . At one point I was asked if my car was carburated, implying that I may
have asked for something else and quoted that price. NOPE. I KNOW WHAT I asked
for and what PRICE I was quoted. So I said I'll ship them back but I refuse to
pay a restocking charge,20%, and want a 100% refund. They said okay. We'll
have to see how this urns out. My biggest gripe is that that had the balls to
charge me a 220% price increase without at least calling me to see if it was
okay! By the way I just got a set of intake hoses from GPR, $4 each, $16 for
the set. Thats still 1/2 of AA's price. Sorry for taking up band width.

P.S.
This has been a learning experience, Now when I make the same mistake twice I
know it !!
