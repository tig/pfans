As people have already mentioned, the capacitive discharge ignition (CD) 
is separate from the points replacement option (which also includes 
Compufire, from AA and other more generic places).  I have a Crane system 
which includes the optical trigger (the XR700).  This works fine and has 
the advantages that Dave Darling described.  Crane also makes a high 
performance optical trigger which must also deliver a hotter signal to 
the coil (the XR3000).  Now, you can install any points replacement 
product (like a XR 700 or a Pertronix or a Compufire or ???) and a CD 
ignition.  I tried this and it has improved the car's idle and power (I 
think).  I put in a Crane coil (PS91) and Crane's CD (the HI-6).  I like 
Crane's CD because it also includes a rev limiter.  Also, I checked with 
various performance-oriented car folks (read: small-block Chevy) and the 
jury seems split as to whether the MSD or the Crane is more reliable.  I 
guess Crane's technology is significantly more sophisticated and so many 
people say its more reliable.  I have heard of MSDs failing but who 
knows.  To handle this hot of a spark, I am now using a non-Bosch rotor 
since they have resistors.  (Kragen, NAPA, whatever)

One other thing I hope is unrelated.  My ignition switch has gone out 
again.  It was dead when I bought the car about a year ago.  I am hoping 
that the new ignition has not fried the switch somehow.  I really don't 
think this is possible, but if anyone knows of a cause for ignition 
switch death, I am listening.  Replacing these things is a drag.
