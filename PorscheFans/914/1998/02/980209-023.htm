    Josh & Dave (and anyone else who cares):

    FYI...

    The usual description of the "shrouding" is that the side
    electrobe shields the bulk of the air-fuel mixture from the
    flame-front after ignition, but I've been told that the ACTUAL
    reason to index the plugs has to do with keeping the
    side-electrode from shielding the spark-gap from the supersonic
    turbulence above the piston just BEFORE ignition.

    The guy who told me about the supersonic turbulence is a client
    of mine; he demonstrated to me the benefits of indexing on a
    small-block Chevy.

    I was pretty impressed with the results; horsepower went from
    340 to 350 at the engine speed at which we were testing.

    However, the engine was running VERY high compression (13.5-to-1
    or something) with Brodix heads and Keith Black pistons; I have
    a feeling that indexing isn't anywhere near as helpful on
    lower-compression engines.
