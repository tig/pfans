I just rebuilt top end because of #4 intake valve seat loss and car ran great!!
for 280 miles, resetting valves at 40 miles, but at 280 miles #3 intake rocker
arm had 1/8 " play and when reset ran 5 miles and started missing bad! I assume
a valve seat has come out and is blocking the valve from seating all the way in.
 Please tell me I'm wrong!! Total head rebuild by Dan Hall, who comes highly
recommended in the Portland OR area.  They did not replace #3 seat so its not
their work which has gone bad.  Should I take off head and have all the seats
replaced and by whom??? Help this will be third rebuild in 25,000 miles (the
first rebuild at 90,000 to replace all the galley plugs with threaded plugs,
since one had fallen out!)!
