Blake,

I snipped this off the 914 list. What VW "T" fitting can I buy to
eliminate the factory brake balancer. Also, will I need to buy a
proportioning valve to keep the brakes balanced if I do that?

BTW you missed a chance to co-drive my car, yesterday at AMS.

You will need to get the banjo fittings off the front of an early 914. 
Your
best way to get the brake line to clip into the holder on the trailing
arm is
to buy a new one.  I have done this to my street car and used the old
brake
lines off the front and they are a little to short.  If you are removing
the
rear dust covers, make sure you use the bracket that holds the two ends
of the
U's together back inbetween the caliper and the control arm.  You may
also
want to remove your proportioning valve and but in a T fitting off a VW,
this
will make the brakes work alot better.  They will not lock up the rears
wheels, I have this done on my street car a my race car and have never
them
lock up.

Good luck
Blake Meredith
