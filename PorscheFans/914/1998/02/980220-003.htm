Yeah, tell me about it. :) Dave Darling can explain...

It's not a simple swap when converting to a sideshifter. You need a new
shifter assembly also. If you've got the nerve, you can pull off the rear
cover of the transmission while it is still in the car and inspect first
gear and the shifter assembly. Used tailshifters would be cheap (less than
100$) depending on where you live.

Have you synched the carbs? Is the linkage sloppy? Use the crossbar linkage,
I hear it's much better.
