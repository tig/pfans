	At a guess, I'd say that your motor mount bar *is* bent,
and that is messing up the geometry of the shift linkage.  When
you coast, the engine/tranny assembly "relaxes" and the linkage
geometry is restored, so you can shift.
	Another possibility is that the rubber engine mounts
(they're inner mounts on the 73-76, they're outers on the 70-72)
have sheared through or otherwise failed.  You can take a look
at them as best you can with the drivetrain in place, if you don't
see anything wrong with them then you may need to support the
drivetrain while you pull off the bar and pull out the various
mounts.

	Hmm--a less-expensive, less-intrusive suggestion is to
adjust the shift linkage.  Haynes has a reasonable procedure for
this.  At least, it's reasonable for side-shifters; I don't know
about the tail-shifter one.
	It may not cure the problem, but it's the easiest thing to
check.

	Good luck!
