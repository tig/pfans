Sorry, but I cant help you with a quick how-to
on this one.  I have done the job, but it was so
involved that you would not want to read my bs.

I can say however, that it is about the most difficult
task on the car, and not break the dadburn thing.
The blower box is made of (I think) stryrene and with
age and fuel fumes gets hard and brittle.  The problem
is those spring steel clips that hold the clamshell
together. . .and the actuator cables with those snap
clamps.  Almost none of the mechanism is fastened
with screws.  Access to the thing is a headache too.

The motor in these is an open frame type and uses
those 'permanently lubricated' bushing bearings.
The only problem is the lifetime of 'permanent' is
defined as less than 10 years. .freezup is imminent.
The failure mode is generally a burnout in the resistor/RF
chokes used to suppress RFI (radio frequency interference)
generated by the motor as it runs.  When the motor
armature freezes, the overload frys the resistor/choke and
then the motor has an open circuit at whatever speed the
console setting was at the time of the event.

In later years of 914 production, the factory added a
screen of sorts to prevent entry of leaves and rubbish
that might jam the blower, but in my experience, the
biggest problem is moisture that corrodes the thing.

In relative terms, if you can fix the fresh-air blower
in your 914, you should have little difficulty with
rustoring the body.
