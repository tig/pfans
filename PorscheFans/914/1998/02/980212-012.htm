I just went through trying to fix mine.  Dave is right.  You have to pull
the tank to get to the blower.  You can pull the blower without pulling the
wiper motors.  The resistors are in the blower housing at the connection
itself and the motor has power all the time.  The slider in the dash moves
a series of wipers across some contacts to select the path to ground.  Mine
only partially works after I tried cleaning it and the wiper contacts up.
Probably need a new motor.

You can see part of the blower housing in the picture of my old parts car,
with the gas tank removed. Go to

then click on the 2nd picture down of my old parts car.

It is the black housing right below the fresh air grill in the center.  The
 whole housing comes out then you take it apart to get
to the motor, clean out the leaves, etc.  It is held together with metal
slide clamps.  The housing is plastic and brittle so be
careful when removing it and taking it apart.

     Assuming you're serious:
     The front blower (the "fresh air" blower) is located just aft
of the gas tank.  You have to take that out to get to it.  And you
either have to take the blower out to get to the wiper motor, or take
the wiper motor out to get to the blower--I forget which way 'round
they are.
     How it works:  The top slider on the "environmental controls"
in the dash controls it.  The slider opens up the flaps from the front
air intake (in front of the windshield) as you move it to the right.
When you get to the place labled "I", it turns the blower on.  At the
"II" mark, it goes on a higher speed, and at "III" it goes on full
speed.  Mine only works on "II", and only sometimes.
     If I remember correctly, the blower motor is always fed power,
but not always grounded.  The ground goes through the switches on the
slider--the lower speeds having more resistance in series with the
switch than the higher speeds do.  That's how they vary the speed.
     You may be able to get the blower working by cleaning up all
the contacts in the slider mechanism.  However, if the blower hasn't
been run in many many years, it may be frozen or dead anyway, which
will require you to pull the gas tank to fix or replace it.
