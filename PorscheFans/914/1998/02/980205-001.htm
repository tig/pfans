	The manual is only so-so on the rear pads.  If I remember correctly,
it leaves out a lot of details about using the adjuster screws to back the
pistons off the pads so you can put new thicker pads in.
	One word of caution, though:  They have you remove the pad retaining
pins, and tell you to "be careful of the spring clips".  What they really
mean is that you need to use some pliers (or anything that works) to pull the
cotter pins out of the pad retaining pins.  Just pull straight away from the
center of the hub.  If you don't, you will have to hammer HARD to get the
retaining pin out, and hear a cute little tinkly sound as the pieces of the
cotter pin hit the floor.  (Yes, I am that dumb...)  It takes some searching
at the local Orchard Supply to find cotter pins that are close in size to the
original ones, BTW.  (And I think they are called "spring pins" or "spring
clips"--they aren't quite cotter pins...)
	Another thing they don't tell you--clean everything, put that sticky
blue goop on the back of the pads.  It helped my squealing for a little
while.
	Good luck!
