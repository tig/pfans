  As far as I know, all cars that had the 19 mm master cylinder also
had dual circuit brakes; therefore, no matter where yours came from,
it must have the warning switch installed.   If you have never had
the master cylinder out for rebuild or replacement, it is easy to see
how you might not find the switch... one must know exactly where it
is in order to find it by the "grope" method.

  This is a catch 22 situation; the switch CANNOT be reset off the
master cylinder.  The reason is that the switch is mounted into a
hydraulic gallery on the side of the switch; removal of the switch
will almost certainly introduce air into the master cylinder,
requiring bleeding of the system, and bleeding the system will almost
certainly trip the switch, requiring it to be reset.
   Your best bet is to put the car on stands and remove the splash
guard plate that covers the steering rack and master cylinder.   Once
this is out of the way, clean all the spider webs, leaves, mud, etc.
out of the cavity.   Then, with the aid of a good strong shop light,
the switch should be obvious.   Once you have located it, you will
then be able to find it through the left front wheel well the next
time you need it.
   Incidentally, the switch is aproximately one inch in diameter,
projects from the left side of the master cylinder (i.e. towards the
left front wheel) and has two wires on push-on type terminals, plus a
very small rubber boot that sticks out next to the wires.   Pushing
in on this rubber boot resets the switch.

   Some cars had brake safety warning switches that were tripped by a
low fluid level warning float switch on the master cylinder
reservoir.   You would need to retrofit a different reservoir with a
float switch, and reroute the wiring from the master cylinder
location to the reservoir location, which is on the other side of a
bulkhead.   Probably  lots easier to figure where the existing switch
is and how to reset it.
