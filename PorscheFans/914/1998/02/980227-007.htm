Job in progress: removing and installing TAILSHIFTER front shift bar.

I have removed the old front shift bar. Its length is 7 5/8" shorter than
the correct length of the one that I am trying to install. PO had sawn 7
5/8" off the bar and rewelded together. Took me a very long time to file
that weld smooth on the bar as it sat in tunnel so to exit thru the bushing
in the firewall.

Problem now is that the only way I see of getting the new bar back in may be
to remove the front engine support bar or worse the engine itself. I have
left the bushing in the firewall since I don't have one to replace it with.
If I knock it out, I am sure that a new one will have to be used and even
then front shift bar still may not slide back into the tunnel. Bushing
appears very good.

Do you have any suggestions? The complete gear shifting bar assembly has
been removed and is sitting on the pavement of my garage.

Another thing. The piece that was connected to the extreme front of the
front shift bar, the shift rod head is worn bad. There is a groove worn
downward on the extreme front wall of the part. Will this have to be
replaced in order to adjust linkage correctly? I know it needs to be
replaced, but I can do that later when I have the part since it is held on
by a tit set screw.

Have quit wrestling with it until I hear from some of you on some advice.

Question. Why do we call the person PO when we really think SOB?

Thanks.
