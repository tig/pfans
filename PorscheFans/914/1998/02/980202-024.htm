Count me among those who buy/sell 914 parts to support my speed bug.  I
always buy from distressed individuals ("I want this stuff out of my
garage, now!") and sell at prices any 914 driver can afford.

Part of the problem with buying factory parts is that some are shared
between 914 and 911, which drives up the 914 owners parts prices ##if
you buy from "dealers"##.  Many original 914 parts are NLA, or at best
unobtanium in new, boxed condition, but that doesn't mean you can't buy
them in good usable condition from a number of different resources.

The only thing is, you have to be willing to spend the time and do the
research if you want to avoid payinhg top dollar.  Sometimes it means
waiting until a killer deal comes through..just keep your buy-lists
current and make all the connections you can.
