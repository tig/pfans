It's available in 10, 12, and 14 gauge, stranded and solid. Several colors,
too. The insulation is rated for 600V, is impervious to automotive fuels and
oils, and good to 105 deg C (220 F). The only stuff better than that would
be teflon coated wire, which is very expensive. This stuff is cheap. 12
gauge stranded was about 5$ for 50 feet.

>Also, I found metric M8 socket head cap screws in grade 12.9, the highest
grade you can generally find, for cheap. Other metric stuff too. Oh yeah,
there is no metric standard for sheet metal screws, so all of those
sheetmetal screws in your car are either #4 to #12 US, also available at
Home Depot.

>Finally, when you move the battery to the trunk, you need a +12V
distribution bus for all those wires that were previously connected to the
positive terminal on the battery. I found what I needed at Home Depot. I'm
going to use a ground bus, insulated from the chassis by standoffs, that is
typically used in circuit breaker panels. I like the Square D brand. These
are a solid piece of rectangular rod with several holes in it, each hole is
crossdrilled and tapped for a securing screw. You need something that will
handle 50amps, so those wimpy terminal strips you find at Radio Shack will
not work. With these ground busses, you simply tin the end of the wire with
solder, then insert the wire in the hole and secure with the screw.
