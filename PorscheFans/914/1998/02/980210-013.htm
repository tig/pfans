Hi all,

	Well as the subject line says, it's time for a new front air dam. THe
previous one I have/had (well, what's left of it) was teh FS-3200 from
automashin'. It's the sport/competition air dam w/brake ducts. And I'll
very likely just replace it with the same, but I'm thinking of getting
the FS-3300 which is the deeper one and has more of a splitter type of
lower leading edge. Does any one have and experience with these? How
much lower are they and does it cause a significant problem navigating
bumps and ramps? Any noticable difference in handling at speed?
	The reason why I'm think of this is that with the 20% off sale right
now, the big ol' super spoiler is only $20 more than the one I planned
to replace my old one with anyway.

	So, any ideas or suggestions?

Hope ta see a bunch of you Bay Area folks tomorow night. Tied House in
Mtn. View, 6:30. 

-Josh2
