After having my wisdom teeth extracted, getting a massive ear infection, the
flu, and then an nasty form of viral pneumonia I'm finally back up and
running.  I wish I could say the same about my 914!  My "down time" gave me
a chance to set some money aside, and I've found a new mechanic.  The 914
goes into the shop tomorrow, and with any luck, they'll find whatever it is
that I've been missing for the last several months.  Since I wanted to drive
the car over to the shop rather than pay to have it towed, I took it out for
a quick spin and quickly discovered that as then engine warms up, the
hunting is so sever that it's nearly impossible to keep the engine running.
In addition, it cuts out intermittently under all open throttle conditions.
Suddenly, it clicked in my head that this was definitely due to a lean
running condition.  So, with a little crimping and soldering, I've placed a
5k variable resistor inline with my head temp sensor.  Man, what a
difference!  When I turn the resistance up to about 1500 ohms, the hunting
becomes pretty minor, then engine stops cutting out under full throttle, and
with a little adjustment of the idle screw, it no longer dies.  It still
runs pretty rough at idle, and will cut out at constant throttle.  In
addition, there's now a little bit of black smoke from the exhaust, and it
smells of gasoline.  I think it's pretty obvious that I have to put the
engine into a rich-running condition just to drive it, so the question is:
Has anyone encountered anything like this before?

Thanks again,
