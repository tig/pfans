Jim,

If you follow the link to Brian's sound system,
http://www.skyinternet.ca/~brianng/caraudio.html
you'll find info and tips on what seems as a very high-end 914 sound system
that won't compromise the stock appearance. A lot of general info on how to
design a car audio system is offered as well

I have also enclosed an old post I have saved from Tim's 914 Forum a long
time ago. Hope these hints can be of help to you!

Good luck,

Gudmund Olsson

Having done an installation in a Toyota MR-2 some years back I will tell
what I know about Mid Engine Stereo Installations. In the 914 a single
Bazoka tube would work very well under the Glovebox. This would provide some
bass and the stock locations could be used for midrange with a seperate
tweeter mounted perhaps on the A pillars or even the front part of the
doors. In general Bass will travel through the car no matter where the
source is located. Higher frequencys are more directional. I wouldn't
suggest mounting your tweeters on the B pillar nor would I suggest a single
Full Range Co-Axial or Tri-Axial type speaker. VERY good results can come
from seperates with minimal cost. As for my MR-2 I orginally mounted 1
single 12" Woofer in the front trunk. The firewall still in place and the
sound was great, even with firewall seperating the actual bass waves and
trunk closed. I latter replaced the single with 2 12" woofers and cut a
series of 2" holes in the firewall to get the Air Pressure into the Cab. The
Bass was there but the air movement was Not. It sounded great. The 914 has
the gas tank in the way so this probally isn't possible nor would you want
to butcher up your precious 914 over a stereo system. But the Bass Tube
would work well. If you crave More Bass (I consider myself a Basshead), My
last Stereo car I competed with in the 51-100 Watt class running a single
Orion HCCA 250 Amp, a 18" Rockford fosgate Sub Woofer mounted in the rear
hatch of a Subaru Hatchback, 2- 12" Orion Woofers, 4 5" Midrange 2 JBL
Tweeters in the door. This car was complete with dual batteries, Color TV,
VCR, AudioControl EQL, Sony EQ and Sony DiskJockey for the music source. I
sold the car about a year latter after a few entries in the Stereo
Competition world. The 914 with it's small interior size should take much to
really get things rockin. I'd suggest at least 100 clean watts but a single
Amp could do the trick. Perhaps a 3 channel if you want to run the Bazoka
Tube.

      I have finally gotten to the point where I just can't live with
the original "Frankfurt" Blaupunkt and speakers in my '75 any longer, so
I am installing a Blau Denver, with "thummer" remote, and I have
questions regarding what kind of speakers I can fit in the original kick
panel housings. I bought a pair of Blaupunkt 5X7's when Crutchfield
assured me that they would fit, but you probably already know the end of
that story, about an inch too long on the long axis. Now, can I adapt a
pair of 4X6 Plates or what  ... that will retain the original look with
decent range and response, and not be too deep. Finally, is there any
clearance problem with an electric antenna coming out of the original
hole.  I am sure that this will undoubtedly make the car faster, improve
cornering, help idle and low end response, .. well, at least I can put
Kraftwerk playing "Autobann" and hit the highway.
                                                            TIA   Jim S.
