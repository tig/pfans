Hi Demick,

you wrote:
<<This brings up a question of mine.  As far as the fog lights go, the
wiring is a bit confusing. I know that the fog lights are tied to the
headlight operation and I believe that they may be tied to the high/low beam
state also.  Do the fogs go off/on depending on whether the headlights are
on high or low beam (assuming the fog light switch is turned on of course).
Will the fogs turn on when only the parking lights are on without the
headlights?  If someone can fill me in it would help me understand the
wiring.>>

Well, the factory setup is that the foglights work with the low-beams.  When
you flip on your high-beams, the fogs turn off.  It's really neat this way,
especially when you flash someone with your hi-beams.  They know for sure,
as your fogs wink out, and back on again.

In Canada, all 1990 and newer cars have "Daytime Running Lights" which turn
on the park light circuit and low-beams so that the cars are more visible,
especially on dark cloudy days.  That's why when a Canadian car is following
you on the freeway, it's headlights are on.  I think the US cars now have
DRLs too, but I'm not sure.

I've re-wired my light system so that I get DRLs.   My foglights and park
lights wired together with a DPST relay. When the key is turned to "run"
position, and the foglight switch is pulled "on," both my foglights and park
lights turn on, regardless of the position on the headlight switch.  This
means I can just leave the foglight switch on all the time, it is controlled
by the ignition key.  The only time it's turned off is when I'm autoXing,
for that extra 1/4 hp :')  I've also dimmed the lighbulb on the foglight
switch by taping up the orange cover (yours might be green) from behind with
some coloured electrical tape.  This makes the switch a bit less bright and
annoying.

The relay is a Double Pole, Single Throw, which keeps the parklight switch
from "back-feeding" and turning on the foglights when the foglight switch is
turned off.  If you're familiar with relays and wiring, it's a simple,
straightforward job.  I can even make up a wiring diagram and post it up on
my web page sometime.

cheers, Brian Ng
