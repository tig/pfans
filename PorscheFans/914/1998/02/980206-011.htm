	Does anyone know where I can find a decent bilge pump for my
914?  I'm thinking about actually driving it outside next week, and
I figure I'll need some way to pump all the water back out.

	B^P

	I'm sure the poor little car feels neglected--it's been over
a week since I drove it, and more than that since I did any work on
it.
	But I have been putting a few things together.  I took a
bunch of injectors (11 to be precise) over to Pacific Fuel Injection
(in South San Francisco) and had Gus clean and test them.  The normal
charge is $15 each, but he "threw in" my 11th for free--I guess I got
a quantity discount.
	I have a known good set of 73-74 injectors, a known good set
of 75-76 injectors, two extra good 75-76 injectors, and one oddball.
He said it worked fine, but it flowed about 20% more than the others.
It also isn't a Bosch injector, since it doesn't have a Bosch part
number on it.  A couple of the other injectors were also non-Bosch,
but most were.  In fact, some appeared to be original equipment, com-
plete with crimped-on supply hose!
	While he was at it, Gus replaced the plastic piece on the
end of each injector--the part that the inner "o-ring" goes over.
That bit was loose on several of the injectors, and would have been
the source of a small but serious fuel leak.
	I haven't used the injectors yet, but I have heard good things
about Gus in the past.  If they work as advertised, I will be whole-
heartedly reccommending him!
	Other neat stuff--Gus drives a white VW microbus.  I asked
about it, and he popped open the engine lid.  To show me an MFI 911
six-cylinder engine!!!  Va-ROOOM!  Evidently there's a 911 5-speed
hooked up to it, too.  Gus says that it's nice to be able to keep up
with traffic going uphill--and that it surprises quite a few people.
Heh heh heh--I bet!!
	What an awesome tow vehicle/parts fetcher.
