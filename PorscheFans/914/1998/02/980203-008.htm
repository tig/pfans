Oops, that should be a Hurst-Olds rear wing. The intercooler was someone
else's creation, probably MSDS, the company that built this wild
creature. 

For anyone's interest, MSDS claims to do allot of 914 stuff, but when I
_finally_ received their catalog (had to leave a message for one, they
don't answer their phone), I discovered that it really should be 914-6
stuff. Just a small assortment of things that could be used for a 914-4,
primarily a header exhaust system. But since they don't answer their
phones, I couldn't get any actual information about it.
