	Assuming you're serious:
	The front blower (the "fresh air" blower) is located just aft
of the gas tank.  You have to take that out to get to it.  And you
either have to take the blower out to get to the wiper motor, or take
the wiper motor out to get to the blower--I forget which way 'round
they are.
	How it works:  The top slider on the "environmental controls"
in the dash controls it.  The slider opens up the flaps from the front
air intake (in front of the windshield) as you move it to the right.
When you get to the place labled "I", it turns the blower on.  At the
"II" mark, it goes on a higher speed, and at "III" it goes on full
speed.  Mine only works on "II", and only sometimes.
	If I remember correctly, the blower motor is always fed power,
but not always grounded.  The ground goes through the switches on the
slider--the lower speeds having more resistance in series with the
switch than the higher speeds do.  That's how they vary the speed.
	You may be able to get the blower working by cleaning up all
the contacts in the slider mechanism.  However, if the blower hasn't
been run in many many years, it may be frozen or dead anyway, which
will require you to pull the gas tank to fix or replace it.
