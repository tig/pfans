Awright. . .GRrr. .

Poor dumb, little Kyle replaced his floorpan and had absolutely NO help.
Neither had he ever done one before.
Years ago, I went to Oklahoma City to attend a couple War Bonnet tech
sessions sponsored by our friendly and ever-so-useful PCA, where I spoke
with such luminaries as John Paterek, The Andersons, David Seeland and
Allen Caldwell.
 -None of these gurus was worth a, well youknow what I mean.  Forget it.
(dont get me wrong. . .these are *great* guys -but they wont do your work)

What I found out from these guys is that the lowly 914 'taint worth fixin. .

Guess where the most insight came from?  A feller named Al Zim.. .yeah, 
Zim's.
He had with him a German dude that I cannot recall his name, but he
rustores 356's in der fatterland.  They also had a video tape of the 
processes.
I picked his brain good.  Then I went home and ate steel, rust, mouse turds, 
etc.

I suppose I could write a damn good article on ripping out and replacing a
floor pan, but no body has offered me any money to do so.  and probably 
wont.
If some kind soul would donate a scanner. . .I would web-site over 200 
photos
of this work -and more!  any takers? See me after this seminar. . .

Soo, here we begin a free lesson. . .goddamnit someone put this in the 
archives
because I'm only gonna say this ONCE!  (yeah, I'm torqued over some local 
shit)
You do realize that this is like teaching the knowledge of the universe 
while the
pupil stands balanced on one foot. . .

First prerequisites:
You gotta know WELDING
You gotta know METALWORK
You gotta have GUTS
You gotta have TOOLS
YOU gotta have TIME and PATIENCE
you gotta have PRECISION like a micrometer and a machinist' scale -not a 
ruler.

Ok, first remove the seats and carpet and rear pads.  Remove the rockers.
Survey the damage to the longitudinal outer and the corners of the floorpan.
HOW?  Lay a droplight under the car and look for pinholes from inside the 
car.
You may have to chip out ALL the bituminous coating the inner/outer floor.
(this will keep you busy a couple days heh, heh)  use a chisel, cup knot 
brush
and a scotchbrite wheel -on a steek.
Survey the damage, carefully examine the seam around the underside of the 
car
where the floorpan attaches.  Look for areas that are gonna need TLC before
you can reattach a new pan.

Ok, this is where it gets dicey.  You gotta decide if ripping out the entire 
pan
is worth it, or can you replace 1/2, 1/4, or just small segments.
You can buy a full pan, or a 1/2 pan (left or right side).  (Cy's or 
Stoddard)
Usually, floorpans are bad in the extreme corners, most notably in the front
where the wheelwell and forward firewall attach.  In this case, you could
be in for MORE than just a floorpan.  I re-fabricated from flat sheet the 
curves
and flanges. . .trust me, this is tedious work, but cheaper and quicker than
doing a whole floorpan, wheelwell AND longitudinal.  Speaking of 
Longitudinals,
these little devils like to rust out at the front end where they attach to 
the
wheelwell.  Those clever designers, whom put in such cute structures
 -like that stupid plate between the rocker and longitudinal forward -they 
trap
all manner of crap that rusts the bejeebers out of the longs.  Anyway,

When you have decided where to patch and where not to.
Cut the pan or section out.  (this little sentence makes a mountain of work)
HOW?  (use either or in combination)
Method 1) Use a 1 to 3mm thick cutting wheel on a mandrel inserted into an
angle die grinder, using 20,000 rpm to surgically remove metal in parallel
with the seam flange, leaving the flange as a place to weld in your new pan.
Later, you can chisel out the remains of the flange, but this depends on
your eye's detection of rust damage.  You may be able to just flush grind
away the remains of the pan flange leaving the 'good' metal.
You can also run into an unfortunate situation where there is so much rust
cancer that there is almost nothing to work with when welding in the new.
This is where your guts are gonna tighten, if you dont get all the cancer, 
well
you know what happens to people when the surgeons miss some. . .
and if you try to weld good metal to rusty metal, shame on you, your welds
wont hold. . .and you've created a freeway time-bomb.

Method 2) Use a spot-weld cutter and drillcut every single spot weld on the
pan flanges being careful not to disturb the base metal. . .dont cut too 
deep.
 -this could be tens to hundreds of welds depending on the mood of the guys
when they spotted the car together decades ago. .
