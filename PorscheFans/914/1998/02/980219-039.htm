O.K., that makes more sense.  In fact, I think that if I paid a little more
attention, I would noticed that the subject says "heel & toe"...  So if I'm
clear, it's like this:

Heel & Toe:
1.  With right foot on brake, depress clutch with left foot
2.  Shift transmission to neutral
3.  Roll right foot onto the gas and bring engine speed up
4.  Shift transmission into lower gear
5.  Release clutch from left foot
6.  Roll right foot off of brake entirely onto the gas

Double-Clutching:
1.  With right foot on brake, depress clutch with left foot
2.  Shift transmission to neutral
3.  Release clutch from left foot
4.  Roll right foot onto the gas and bring engine speed up
5.  Depress clutch with left foot
6.  Shift transmission into lower gear
7.  Release left foot from clutch
8.  Roll right foot off of brake entirely onto the gas

The difference being that heel and toe only brings the engine up to speed,
while double-clutching brings the engine and transmission up to speed...
correct?

Thanks again,
