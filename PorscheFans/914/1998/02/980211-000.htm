Geez George, thanks for asking us, and thanks for making the investment. I'd
love to have a set on my street car, assuming they are lighter. How much do
they weigh compared to the stock bumpers? If the fit and finish are as good
as you say, then it would be a breeze to just paint them and put them on the
car. My bodyguy says it's about 300$ to refinish mine, including welding up
the rubber bumperette mounting holes. I take it you have embedded nuts in
them to accept the stock mounting bolts?

As to your question, I have no idea if there is a good market for them at
any price. You certainly are not marking them up very much. I'm not sure if
the 914's popularity is going up or down.
