Hi, I read your posting on the 914 list and wanted to let you know sometimes
parts don't move that quickly and you never to seem to get what you're asking.
I just sold two complete cars (1.7s) and enough parts to build 3 more
including ac systems, running engines and weber carb set ups... I even had
spare hoods, doors, interiors etc... the parts filled a 25 foot uhaul to over
flowing with a car on the trailer behind and a car in the uhaul itself and
only got $1800 for everything. The 914 market seems to be falsely inflated as
I WAY OVERPAID for it all and then took over a year to find a buyer when I
lost my storage space. I eventually got out of 914s because I got sick of
seeing guys asking $10,000 for a car that wasn't worth $1500 and seeing the
OUTRAGEOUS prices I was having to pay for simple parts I didn't have, like
brake rotors. It seems ashame that the 914 carries the stigma of the bastard
Porsche but yet vendors will gladly ask 911 prices for everything.
