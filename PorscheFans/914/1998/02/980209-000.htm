I have read with interest the debate over the last few days about the
quality of service given by vendors and the experiences of various
subscribers. Just to add my thoughts: reading this from across the
Atlantic in the UK it is useful to hear about good and bad US suppliers
as when I order parts from some of these companies it helps to know what
kind of experience you are likely to have before parting with your Visa
number!

For what it's worth I have ordered parts from a number of the
"mainstream" 914 suppliers in the US (including AA) and have been
extremely impressed with the quality of service provided. We are often
told about the gulf in customer service between Europe and the US and in
the case of our cars I think this is well demonstrated. My experience of
similar vendors in the UK (admittedly based on VW parts) is that they
don't have the focus on customers and cars that the American specialists
do. One company (called the German Car Company based in Southend-on-Sea)
comes close at times, but  I think the average UK based Porsche/VW
enthusiast could produce a list of problems associated with poor
technical knowledge and sub standard parts that would make the average
American enthusiast weep.

I have just found out that I can order parts from a German company known
as Mittelmotors and get a discount through the UK owners club, so I'll
maybe share my experiences when I next need to spend......

So don't be too hard on your suppliers guys, they generally are "World
Class" but they are also human and it's good to share real and
constructive experiences. Anyway that's my 2pennies worth.

Phil.
