Heat shmeet. Just wear gloves! :) Nah, 'sok, I understand. The heat in
my teener is not the greatest either. And when it does work, it _stinks_
of burnt oil.

This is a new engine with very few actual miles on it. You've invested
alot of time and money in getting this car on the road. If I were you
(which I'm not), I'd drop the engine and do it right. But that extra
0.060 from the head gaskets will cost you a little power. If I'm not
building a race motor, then I'm building a longevity motor. Power is
great, no matter what car it's in, but I don't want to risk rebuilding
my daily driver every year or two. A race car, sure, that comes with the
teritory. But a daily driver to me needs to be a bit more robust. You've
already got the high compression pistons, and cut the heads, you should
be doing just fine. And keep in mind on those compression numbers that
we have 20% less air up here than at sea level, so those compression
numbers will likely read lower than a book says they will.

IMHO & YMMV of course.
