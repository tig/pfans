That was the point I was trying to make. I never implied that Teflon
tape couldn't stand up to the rigors of an air-cooled engine, and never
implied that it would cause leaks. But the nice thing about teflon is
also the reason why I would not want little bits of teflon tape loose in
the engine. Teflon is very durable, and can withstand very high
temperatures, this poses a real problem if a little bit of tape gets
loose and finds its way into a narrow oil passage. The tape will not
disolve, will not break apart, and will not melt. So chances are it'll
clog that little oil passage (probably something like a crankshaft
bearing) and end the motor right quick.

And that's all I have to say about that...
