Hi Ed!

 You asked:

  The deck height is measured from the highest part of the piston
(usually near the edge) to the top of the cylinder (the seating
surface that mates with the head).

   The best way to do this is to remove any shims from under the
barrel, clamp it to the case with cylinder retainers (it's impossible
to hold it still by hand to the required degree of accuracy, I know,
I tried) and lay a machinist's straight edge across the top of the
barrel.   With the piston at TDC, measure the clearance between the
straight-edge and the piston top with a feeler gauge.

  Since you are trying to measure the clearance between the piston
and the "deck" (flat part of head above cylinder... not part of
combustion chamber), you of course measure to the highest point on
the piston, as that is the part that will strike the head if the
clearance is 0 or negative.  I do not know quite how you would do
this with domed pistons, but most of the ones that seem to be out
there are either dished or flat, so the rim of the dish is the
appropriate place.

					Good Luck,
                                                            Jim T.
