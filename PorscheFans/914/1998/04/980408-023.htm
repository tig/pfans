Whew! What a releif, a fellow lister wrote me this afternoon suggesting that I check my CV joint because he had a similar situation and it turned out to be just the CV joint.

So, I wiggled the axles and one CV joint certainly did feel "sloppier" than the other, but it looked perfect. So I decided to detach it from the transmission since I'd have to eventually to take the transmission out anyways. As soon as I pulled it away from the transmission, all the balls of the CV joint and what remained of its case fell out on the floor! Horray! Since when do 914 repairs turn out to be LESS than you anticipated?!?!

So, has anyone been through this procedure before?
How do I remove the axle from the wheel end?
Are there any special tools required?

Thanks,
Steve Iverson
