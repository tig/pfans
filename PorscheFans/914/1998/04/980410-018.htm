Here is the original email that had that ZIP file, from Alex Noordergraaf,
he had changed jobs and was moving so he sold all of his 914 stuff and
unsubscribed to the list.  When he did, He gave us a "tar" (zip) file of
categorized pfile stuff.  Thanks should go to Alex.  


By the way....  I was reading through the latest issue of excellence, I was
reading in the letters section about a guy in Portland that was modifying a
2.4 911 engine for his 914 project, I betcha it was a fellow listmember...
Mike Lee?!
