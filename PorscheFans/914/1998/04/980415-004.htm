	My own guess is that they changed the mailing-list software (at long
last!!), and that now it only reports the number of people who get message-
at-a-time.
	In case anyone is wondering what this is about, when you post to the
list, you get a reply back from it which is a copy of your note, with a bit
added at the front saying, "Your message was delivered to the *** members of
the PorscheFans-*** list."  Recently, in the 914 list, that number went from
over 500 down to 60.  But I can see that the Usual Suspects (including me)
are still posting, and activity hasn't really declined much if any.
