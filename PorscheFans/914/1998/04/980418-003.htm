Disclaimer:  I in no way condone street racing...  Its bad... so there...
besides this happened on the freeway.

After spend a few hours and a lot of money at Malibu Speedzone I decided to
head home.  On the way this Civic blew by me at about 90 on the freeway.
Since in was 2am I decide to give chase and have a little hi speed fun.  I
caught up with him and we proceeded to explore the top speeds of our machines
and their operators.  As Im wound out at 110 a slight bend comes along in the
freeway.  You ususally barely notice it at 65 but at 110 it looks kinda tight
but what the hey Ive got 4 lanes... so on I go.  The chassis was very stable
through the turn but the 165HR15 Michelins slowly gave way and I experienced
my first 4 wheel drift in a 914... all this at 100mph.  My exit came along
shortly after so I flashed my fog-lights at the Civic and went down the off-
ramp.  It was a great topper to a fun evening just thought Id share it.
