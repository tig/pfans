No real gotchas to this one.  First, pop the go pedal from it's ball/socket
mount on the pedal itself then pop the pedal cable off the same way.  To
get the cable off, you might have to remove a small access plate at the
front of the center tunnel under the carpet.  While you have your fingers
in there, remove the clutch cable from its arm on the cluster.  This is a
tad more difficult to figure out in a blind spot like this.  The cable has
a small clamp that is attached to the cable fitting itself which slides
into the mounting hole.  The Haynes manual should have a pic of this.
Next, crawl under the car, remove the pan under the steering rack, and gain
access to the brake master cylinder.  Remove the 2 nuts from the studs
which are actually welded into the pedal cluster.  Move back into the
cockpit and remove the two mounting bolts at the bottom of the cluster
which hold it to the floor.

Depending on age and condition of the nuts, you might need to use lots of
your favorite penetrating solution.  I've snapped 2 nuts/bolts doing this
before.

Good Luck,
