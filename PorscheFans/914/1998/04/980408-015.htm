Finally got my "new" 75 thru the WA state emissions. This required
points, plugs, condenser, rotor, cap and wires as well as a "leaning" of
the dual weber 40's and a slight retard to the ignition timing.. I
realize this is probably easier here than in CA, but, hey.....So now the
car coughs and sputters and dull popping sounds come from the exhaust and
I am ready to get it going strong. The engine is an EC 1.8 that may or
may not have a big bore kit. The venuris are 28 mm and  I have no idea
about the jets. I did bump up the timing a hair to help and plan on
taking it to NWCR to be rejetted and new venturies. Questions:
1. They say 32 mm is ok for 2.0 ---what about 1.8? Same? Smaller?
2. What jet sizes should we put in? Emulsion Tube #? Suggestions?
3. Will I need to keep the old venturis and jets to pass the test next
year? Or will we get it thru with a tuned setup with the proper
adjustments?
4. Is it OK to have them bore out the venturi's or get new one?

My first 914 was a weber 1.7, but my last was a L-jet. Can anyone compare
and contrast exhausts for (audible) volume? My 4-tip Monza on the Weber
1.7 was too loud for my taste. The 75 L-jet w/ single tip bursch was OK.
How would a Weber 1.8 w/ Monza single pair contrast?

Thanks in advance.
Nick
