Keith,
Hey, could you do me a favor and post the below message to the PorscheFans 
list for me?  Because the information technology people can't seem to pull 
their heads from their butts our proxies keep changing and this keeps me 
from posting to the PorscheFans list (because it is SO picky about who it 
gets info from).  Luckily I am able to get the digests.

How is the information in the owners manuals figured out?  For example, to 
get the 1/4 mile time and speed is there a 160-lbs driver racing the car 
on a dragstrip with 1-gal of gas and no spare tire OR are the figures 
calculated based upon weight and dyno results?

Thanks,
   Toby Erkson

Toby: I responded to dean's message on porschefans and he said that you were

the one with the problem. My original owner's manual for the 74 1.8 has a 
"transmission speed" chart if that will be of any help. If it doesn't rain 
tomorrow I will probably drive the porsche and will try to determine the 
1/10 mile speed for you

If you want a copy of the manual page send me your mailing address
