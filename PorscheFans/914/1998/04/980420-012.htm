	Note: I have not done this yet, but I have talked to a local
mechanic about it (the one who re-keyed my other locks).
	He tells me that you simply remove the two Allen screws at the
very rear of the front trunk.  They're back left and aft (left is the
driver's left hand) of the brake reservoir, even aft of where the cable
comes through the sheetmetal.  Then you pull the cable on back into the
cockpit.  (Assuming that you've already undone the cable from the latch
up front, of course.)
	After that, popping the lock cylinder out is supposed to be
pretty obvious.  I assume that there's another cam and screw arrangement
like in the other locks...

	Good luck, and if you do get this done, please write it up for
us so we don't have to rely on second-hand info (like mine)!
