Thanks for the response again Don.  Your supposition may be correct.  How
do you (or the listmaster) go about doing a poll of current users to
verify if there are actually 56 or 456 users of 914 PorscheFans?

Here are two more scenarios to think about.

1- Rich Johnson  versus Me & the repeater problem.  I talked with Rich
last night for a while about this prob.  He says he's never been affected
by the repeater prob.  When it has gone on all three times I've been
around, I get hellacious amounts of repeat messages.  The last time (just
around Christmas time) I was receiving as many as 40 and 50 copies of the
same message to sign up in a driver ed course somewhere, and some poor
soul was trying to sell seats or something.  The two combined gave me as
many as 120 repeat messages per day.  Needless to say,  I unsubscribed
for a while.

2- When I do post to the 914 list, I am immediately unsubscribed from
receiving further list-generated posts.  I can post to it, but I stop
receiving everyone else's via the daily postings.  I cannot receive via
"digest mode" because I'm on Juno, so switching to that method is a
non-answer to me.  I have to continually unsubscribe and resubscribe
every time I post a personal message to the list.

It all sounds like a glitch in the list service program to me, but then
again, I know nothing about modern computer programming (I learned Basic,
Cobol and Fortran back in the '70s - showing my age a bit :-)

Just some thoughts from me, and since I'm posting this, I will probably
have to unsubscribe now.
