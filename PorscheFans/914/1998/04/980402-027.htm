As a favor, I helped another '14'er install a 1.8 engine into his '75 a
couple of days ago. About 4.5 hours, and the old engine was out and the
"new" was in..  Apparently, everything was going too well....  Got all
re-attached and here is the problem - no gas out of the injectors on
cranking the engine?!?  Other details are as follows:

Pressure from the FP is 75 PSI before the regulator and 38 PSI on the
rail,
Stuff I have swapped out to try to get the thing to run are: Replaced
the resistors block as the old one had a broken wire; Tried using
another control box with no effect; New Dist cap/rotor, etc.; New
relay(s); used a different engine wiring harness; etc., etc, etc...

Any thoughts, help, crazy suggestions?  I'm open to almost anything at
this point (except carbs:-)

John
