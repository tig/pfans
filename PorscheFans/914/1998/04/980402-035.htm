	I agree with Mike about "experts".  I mean, it kinda frightens me
every time someone calls me an "expert" to my face.  I'm still the same
idiot that I always was (c'mon, driving roofless in a hailstorm?  Not
having my voltage regulator plugged in?), I've just broken most of the
stuff on my car already...

	Really?  My experience is the opposite.  I find there's usually so
much GOOP and CRUD on the screw, in and on the throttle, and inside the idle
passages, that there's NO CHANCE for corosion or parts freezing.
	At least, so far.  (I think I need a bulk discount on carb cleaner
at this rate...)

>April Fool. Got you since this was written earlier on April 1 and mailed now..

	Mike, I don't always understand you, but I always enjoy reading what
you write.  And I usually find it very informative, too.

	Later!
