If you've ever seen the Gene Berg catalog what I've got on the Thing is his
Berg 42 Special carbs setup.  I believe they are DCNF Weber 42's on short
intake manifolds (designed for the Type 3 VW).  I was just trying this
without really knowing if it would work or not.

I also have a motorcycle so I'd gotten the 4 tube mercury balancer from the
motorcycle section in the JCWhitney catalog, about $50 I think.  It is
about a 2 foot yellow plastic plank with 4 tubes on it and a mercury
reservoir that feeds all 4.  You stand or hang it upright.  There are
attachments at the top of each tube for some rubber hose. The rubber hose
is about 1/8" id and has a bead with a very tiny hole pushed into each end.
That hole is about like a sewing needle size.

I drilled very small holes into the outside sides of the intake manifolds
as close to the mounting base of the carbs as I could. Centered in each
manifold tube.  I made these holes with the smallest numbered drill I had,
think a #40.  Figured I could always make bigger if I needed to.   Then I
drilled again, made the outer holes larger but not all the way thru for  a
tight slip fit for some short lengths of brass tube, the brass tube OD was
a fit for the ID of the rubber tubes on the balancer. I pushed the brass
tube pieces in with some 620 green loctite sleeve retainer goop.  Figured
if I screwed up I could plug the holes in the manifold with no problems.
The brass tubes stick out about 1" so I can slip the rubber tube on.
Seemed to work fine.  Just watch the columns of mercury rise on the
balancer and get them level. I've got some rubber vacuum caps over the
tubes when not testing.

This also helped find which carb throat was having a problem once.  I could
see the column of mercury bounce up and down for it when I heard the pop
out of the exhaust.

I was just guessing on the hole size into the manifold and on the location.
I figured I'd be ok if I made the location and size uniform and just looked
at the relative readings.  My background is more electrical so I understand
FI systems better.  Carbs are kind of the black box to me though I know the
theory.

Hope this helps someone
