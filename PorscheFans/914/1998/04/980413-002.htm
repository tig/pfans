<< of hunks of metal. Now they are ready to go to get blasted and then plated.
 I'm going to clean up the heads of the bolts and re-blacken them with a kit
 I got from Caswell Plating. These bolts are obsolete, to say the least (M7
 grade 12.9!)
 
 I used my new Dremel tool (what a great toy!) with a cutoff disc to slice
 an "L" in that little metal cover opposite the parking brake lever. Then I
 pried them out.
 
 Are new covers available?
 Are the O rings for the parking brake lever available? (16x25mm,
 rectangular cross section)
 I also need new bleeders, mine are not worth cleaning up.
 
 Tip: the O rings that go between the caliper halves are the same as the
 ones that are used in the stock VW front brakes. >>

Thru bolts should not be reused; they stretch.  You can get new ones.  Order
bolts for the rear of a 911 with unvented brakes (69-71 T).

Don't bother with new O rings for the lever.  They are only a dust shield.
And new round covers are not available.  You'll have to braze up your old ones
or have new ones fabricated.
