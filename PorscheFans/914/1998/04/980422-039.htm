Hi Mike!

You asked:

> What brand, model, or features should a person like myself look for
in a tester?

   That's actually a hard one... there are a gizillion brands and
options out there... I'm partial to the Fluke 8060A that CBS provided
me in my company tools, but I could never afford one for myself...
it's $459.00 in my Newark catalog...  and it's overkill for what you
want.. it measures things like frequency and dBm as well as the usual
stuff... much more than is necessary for working on cars.

  Your best compromise between price and availability is probably
Radio Shack.  You might also check your FLAPS.   You want something
that can measure ohms and DC volts... auto-ranging is nice but not
necessary... almost none of the DVM's on the market will measure more
than 1 amp or so of current, and are therefore useless for automotive
applications.   Some of the Japanese companies are making clip-on DC
ammeters that are the cat's pajamas, but they are priced
accordingly... about $300 as I recall.   Your best bet is to avoid
current measurement unless you absolutely have to, and then buy a
D'Arsonval meter of appropriate scale. 

  So... check around and see what you like... there are some
instruments that are being packaged in safety-yellow resiliant
cases.. this is nice for automotive applications, as sooner or later
you are going to drop the thing.

  Oh, yes... be sure that you get one with detachable probes of
reasonable length... 2 to 3 feet... the probes break so plan on
plug-ins for easy replacement, and you will need the length to reach
some things.


> What is a pot?

  Pot:  electronics technician shorthand / slang for
"potentiometer"... a variable resistor.  Variable resistors come with
three different independently variable parameters:
1.  Value: this is the resistance of the internal element in the
pot... it appears across the outermost two terminals in a
three-terminal device, or is the maximum possible value of a
two-terminal device.  For the 914 application, about 2.5 K ohms
(2,500 ohms) is about right.
2.  Dissipation:   This is the amount of power in watts (or fractions
thereof) that the pot can safely dissipate (waste to air) as heat. 
Note that the dissipation rating of pots is for the whole element;
they have to be de-rated when using only a fraction of the total
resistance (degrees of rotation) or in hot environments (like a 914
engine bay).  Most commonly available pots are 1/2 watt, which is
probably OK for this application, as we are talking about signal
currents only.  (Bigger won't hurt.)
3.  Taper:  This comes in two principal varieties:  Linear, or Audio,
also known as Logarithmic.  There are other varities, but they are
for special uses, and are not likely to be encountered.
  The type of taper is related to the application.  If you want a
volume control for your stereo, then you want a log taper.  The human
ear responds to sound level changes logarithmically, so you want more
and more change of resistance per degree of rotation as you advance
the pot.  On the other hand, for the 914, you would find the range of
interest crowded into one end of the rotation if you used a log taper
pot, and so you want a Linear taper pot... which simply means that
the change in resistance per degree of rotation is linear throughout
the motion range of the pot.

> where do you get one?

  Try Radio Shack first, as their stores are everywhere and easy to
find.  If no luck, then you will have to look in the yellow pages
under electronic components for your area.   You may have to do some
shopping, as many of these are wholesale only, but you should be able
to find someone to help you out.

>  where does it go when you get one?

  It goes in series with the wire to the Temp Sensor II... for
conventional wisdom, if you want increasing resistance with clockwise
rotation (which should also be increasing richness) then connect the
temp sensor II wire to the center lug of the pot, and the harness
wire to the right-hand lug as viewed from the shaft end.  The third
lug is left empty.  If you are in the Bay Area, see if you can get
together with Dave Darling and look at his... one thing though:  as I
remember, Dave didn't solder his wires to his pot... you should. 
Also, put some short "pigtails" on the pot with the 1/4" flag
connectors that match the Temp Sensor II wire and the wire from the
FI harness and plug these into the vehicle... that way you don't cut
up your vehicle wiring and it's a matter of un-plugging two
connectors to go back to "stock".

> and when you get one to go where it is supposed to go, wha do you
do with it?

  It is best adjusted with a CO meter or similar smog equipment, but
basically just richen up a bit and see how it runs.   Again, ask Dave
D. .... he has a lot more experience with twisting on a pot than I
have; I just stuck a 680 ohm resistor in series on mine and called it
a day.

 Hope this helps.
