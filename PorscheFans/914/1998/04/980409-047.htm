Jeff,

The same thing happened to me last year when I installed my Pertronix.
What it came down to was I had my timing advanced a little with the 'stock'
setup to compensate for an inefficient system.  My hot coil was frying my
points quickly, and the advance probably wasn't helping.  I readjusted the
timing slightly and brought the idle back down.  I know you have that
strange F.I. thing on your 914 :), but that shouldn't have any effect on
your symptoms.  But then again, I could be wrong.

By the way, are you going to make it out to the first autox next weekend?
I'm just finishing up the brakes and aligning the car this weekend which
gives me exactly 1 week of after work road time to get the suspension bugs
worked out before the first race!

It should be interesting...

Later,

Dion
