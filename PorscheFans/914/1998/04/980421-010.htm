Yeah, don't. The problem is that the engine is A] very heavy, B] very
expensive, and most importantly, C] too darn big! Appart from the
structural considerations of having to reinforce the chassis to handle
that kind of torque (and all V8 conversions and big six conversions have
those concerns), is that you'll have to lengthen the engine bay
considerably. The 928 engine is not a short engine, and it will not fit
into a stock 914 engine compartment. 

I do recall someone did a 928 conversion, but the had to widen and
lengthen the car in order to do it. Not the most ideal or cost-efective
solution. But, if you've got $20k+ burning a hole in your pocket, go for
it!

just my $.02, and with inflation nowadays, it's probably worth more like
$.002.
