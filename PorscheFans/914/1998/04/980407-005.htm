Yesterday after a brief snow storm I was letting my engine warm up while
brushing the snow off, and noticed a "ticking" sound coming from the engine
while it idled.  It was very regular, and didn't sound too different from a
pencil being tapped on a table.  Since the engine wasn't misbehaving at all,
I blew it off, but, being sufficiently paranoid, I listened for it again
once I got home.  I noticed as it idled outside the garage (now warm) that
the ticking was gone.  Since I've got a little bit of a backfire when
decelerating, I'm assuming that my exhaust isn't seating perfectly against
the heads, and thus I'm hearing the valves through the "gap".  As the engine
warms up, the metals expand, sealing the gap, and hiding the ticking sound.
Does this make sense?  I just adjusted my valves 5 days ago, so I'm afraid I
might have done something else wrong.  Any tips or wisdom to share?

Thanks again,
