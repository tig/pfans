You really don't know what happened until you take it apart. But, what you
do now depends on how much money you have to spend (or how large your line
of credit is!). If the gears themselves are damaged, then it will be very
expensive, since 901 series 1st speed gear pairs are becoming hard to find
new or used. You may be better off finding a used tail shifter, replacing
the first speed synchro and synchro hub, and replacing whatever bushings in
the shifter linkage you can to tighten things up a bit. But, all of these
trannies are very old now, so don't be surprised if the bearings go bad
within a short time. I'm stalled half way through a complete rebuild
because of the expense! (I also have 2 other running old cars that I need
to fix up too)
