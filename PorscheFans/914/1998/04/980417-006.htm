I haven't measured them myself, but I think they are 5 3/4". Mine are
backspaced too far. I'm running 1/4" spacers all around. If I were to
special order wheels I'd order fronts with the standard backspace and go
the deeper backspace for the rears. I could easily run 3/4 to 1 inch
spacers on the front and have plenty of clearance. As a matter of fact
I'd love to find a set of 4 standard offset 4 bolt light-weight 7 inch
wide rims. That way I could have two sets of race tires (autocross &
Driver's Ed). However, after this weekend I might be so sold on my new
tires I may not need 'em.

Believe it or not. I didn't have a wheel bearing problem. It turns out
that my right front strut is bent slightly so my tire and wheel weights
were rubbing on the strut dust shield because of the extreme negative
backspace. And that is with a 1/4 inch spacer! I put a wheel with glued
on weights on that corner and hammered back the dust shield and now
everything is back to normal.

 I'm just now getting ready to

Actually I elected to go with the 225/45 x 15 Hoosier Street TDs. This is
their road race tire. I'd like to do some Driver's Ed with the car and
the TDs still do real well in autocross also. Hoosier doesn't broadcast
this but the third place car in CSP at Topeka was on the TDs in '97.
Also, the life-span is longer 8-)).

If you are wedded to the concept of staying with stock wheelwells (as I
am), I'm positive the 8" wide rims would work great. Just be prepared to
stretch those rear wheelwells if they haven't already been done. I went
out and bought a variety of PVC pipe sizes from 1/2" to 1 1/2" to do mine
but didn't need 'em (cost $1.12).

BTW Hoosier bias-plys work best with zero camber on 914s. That's right.
It's great because your street tires will wear better, too. I run the toe
at 0" in front 1/16" out in the rear. I'm thinking of going 1/8" in on
the rear the next time. I'll see how that works.

If you are presuming "98 CSP "National Championship" there are a ton of
guys who beg to differ with ya.

Tell Bob and Patti "Hi" for me.

I instructed at a drivers school here in Atlanta a couple weeks ago. One
of my students has an M3. Since it is a four passenger car I had 3
students ride with me to demonstrate how to run a slalom. I was really
impressed with the handling of that car. And it was on street tires.
