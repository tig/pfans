Well Hello up North, Mihai. . .
 -Montreal eh?  I heard about the bad French attitudes up there, cool
place tho'

Hmm, TIG will probably work very well -less heat into the affected
zone..

>1. I would buy most of the parts from Cy's and some from Tweeks, do you
>think that they're good places?
  The parts Cy's sell are very good, maybe domestically made.  I spoke
with one
of them at a tech session a few years back.  They're good guys.
  Some Tweeks parts are made in Taiwan.  The sail panels I got from
Tweeks were
thin, they measured 1.0mm thick, the OEM stuff was 1.2mm.  Tweeks, AA,
Cy's
etc. have never burnt me.  They all have their quirks.  The important
thing is that
they are in existence today.  Folks like Pelican Parts are wonderful in
their
support of our needs, but how they make money is where we must be
cautious
in judgment -ask tough questions when ordering and return what you dont
like
 -and be patient.

>2. I can't find any inner longs, who sells them?
>
  Unobtainium eh?  Stoddard might have them -oww$$!
  I patched mine since they are just strait pieces with a curve and
flange.
  Welding these from upside down (inverted position) is a challenge, and
you must keep the heat input as low as possible to avoid burning the
warm air
tubes within the longitudinal.  The TIG will help with this. .

>3. What is the best parts for reinforcing the chassis, AA's new parts
or
>Brad Mayeur's kit?
>
  If we are talking the rear plates, etc. that get tacked onto the body
near the rear
suspension,  Brad probably has a better idear (I have not seen these)
 AA's parts are actually from  Automotion (at least they were when I
bought mine some years back).
**Hey! I have a set that I would sell cheap (If I can find them and the
doc's).**

>4. What's the best way to straiten the car before welding?
>
  The 4 donuts on the underside of the floorpan are the measuring
reference
points used by the factory and aftermarket body shops for checking the
overall
body for dimensions. . .these are in book 8 of the factory manuals, but
you may
be able to get the dim's from a body shop that does VW's and other
foreign
car body work.  This is computerized nowadays.
  Performing the actual 'straightening' is best done at a body shop
using
a 'blackhawk' or at least a concrete floor with drag points built in for
chains and come-alongs, but this is highly dependent on the the extent
of
the twist or warp in your body.  *YMMV*  heh, heh.  I have seen people
use
a bumper jack and chains/come-alongs and jackstands, cinder blocks
and trees or utility poles, bridges, etc.  :)

>5. I was thinking of temporarily supporting the front and the back with
>beams welded half way between the       center tunnel and the longs and
>then do the longs.
>
  I did the 'beams' method once, and now my doors dont fit. . .now I
need
to do the 'chains and come-alongs' gig to correct my body's warp and
twist. . .
  Your best bet is to 'jig' the doors.  By that I mean remove the doors
(you
have to anyway) and install a frame that bolts to the door opening at
the
hinges and the latch point.  I would take it one further by tack welding
the
jig frame up high on the sail panel and down low at the corner of the
'A'
pillar.  Remove and refinish after you complete the rocker/longitudinal
repairs.  Factory book 8 describes this jig. .maybe even a pix.  The
problem
with 'beaming' is that there is tremendous force involved when a lot
of linear welds (such as doing a longitudinal) cool.  I think having the
door jig spreads the force over the door opening, preventing the weld
shrinkage from accumulating.

>6. The curved back part of the inner rocker, doe's anyone make it?
>
  I assume you mean the part under the battery box?  If so, yes there is
a replacement item, (I think I got mine from Stoddard) but it includes
the
engine bay section. . .the part that gets hacked out for the A/C
compressor upgrade.  This is an expensive part, and tough to remove
the old and replace, but it restores the engine bay to original
condition
and improves the engine's cooling.  Very tricky item to install though.
