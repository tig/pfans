Definately try replacing with points, it could save you some money. 

The TPS cutout symptoms are generally under steady cruising at part
throttle, the car will hicup and buck untill you accelerate again. The
problem there is the wiper contacts inside the switch are dirty or worn.
Cleaning is a good start, but the best trick I've found for extending
TPS life is when you have the cover of the switch off, bend the wiper
over like a milimeter or so such that it's no longer on the worn part of
the contact. Then as time goes on, and that spot wears out (and it will)
you can bend the wiper to the other side of the contact and keep going.
The TPS is a wear and tear item, and will, by it's very nature, wear
out.
