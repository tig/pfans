   Boy, this advice seems right on the money, I've already welded the
ears back on two of the pipes where they had started to crack away from
the pipe. I used a thick glass plate that I had to check for flatness,
and they actually seem pretty good. Brad Mayeur also suggested 18 Ft.
lbs. of torque, so that must be the number, couldn't find it in my
microfiche manual. He also suggested loosening the pipes a little and
making sure that you can see copper  all around the pipe where it fits
to the head when you tighten it, so here I go again this weekend. Our
PCA  chapter is roadtripping to Springfield, IL in two weeks for a tour
of Isringhausen Porsche and the Lincoln sights, so I've got to be ready
by then.  Thanks for the help   Jim S.
