Hi there Dave.  Here's another thought.  John Dunkle was having a problem 
with his friend's 1.8L and it turned out to be a problem with the wiring 
harness.  Before you get charged, why don't you take the harness off, and 
check the continuity from the brain to all the components.  With 25 year 
old wiring, it's not uncommon to see some fatigue, especially in the 
heat-exposed engine compartment.

Hope this helps...

-Wayne

Anyone know of a good place to take a 914 in Ft Collins?
   "I've fallen and I can't get up." I'm still baffled by the
   cutting-out problem I'm having. I will try a couple more
   things but time is getting to be a problem. Right now I'm
   scheduled to go to Poudre Sports Car where the owner will
   most likely be working on it to the tune of $60/hour. I
   hope he's fast er a .. good. Maybe I can get them to let
   me get the parts if I need any. If anyone knows a good shop
   in Boulder, Longmont or maybe Denver I'm interested but I
   have to have the car towed so this makes things of course
   more expensive. Anyone hear of a Pertronix going bad?
