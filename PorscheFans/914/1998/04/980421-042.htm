Hi Mike!

You asked:

> First, how do you test the head temp sensor to see if it needs
replacing?

  I notice that you got some answers to your other questions about
electronic ignition systems from people more qualified to speak on
the subject than I, but somehow, your temp sensor question got
overlooked.   The following is straight from the horse's (Porsche's)
mouth... the english usage is theirs, not mine...

" For checking the temperature sensor II, which is situated close to
the spark plug for the 3rd. cylinder, you will have to work in the
following procedure:

  Disconnect plug, connect ohmeter between temperature sensor II and
ground, read indication.

Nominal value:       0.5 - 2.5 kilohms (very temperature sensitive,
value decreases                             with increasing
temperature).

Guide value:          approx. 2.5 kilohms when engine temperature is
approx. 20                             degrees C (68 degrees F).

Replace unit if necessary. " 

  Another writeup I have states that the value should be as follows:

	Temperature	Resistance
	14 F		7 - 12 K ohms
	68 F		2 - 3 K ohms
	122 F		680 ohms - 1 K ohm

 The same writeup states that an emergency substitute for the temp
sensor can be made with a pair of resistors, a spdt switch, a
connector to mate with the FI harness, and a ground wire.   The
values selected are 680 ohms for a hot engine, and 2.5 k ohms for a
cold engine.   This would imply to me that the temp sensor II value
probably should not drop much below 500 ohms or so when the engine is
hot, but as I have never measured mine, I don't really know.

  I hope this is of some help.

					Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
