Sob, sob. Bad news and my family and friends don't seem to understand my time of sorrow as well as I thought the Porschefans list would, so here's my short story:

My trusty 901 just called it quits after about 6000 miles with the 3.6 liter. It had performed flawlessly, without any signs of stress until this evening, when suddenly something snaped. I haven't had it apart or even closely examined it yet, but I'm pretty certain some internal component of the transmission failed. None of the gears engage, but just make a lots of crunching noises when the clutch is slowly released (I haven't even had the heart to completely engaged the clutch). Any guesses or suggestions as to where to start?

I've never used 1st gear and started out of 2nd. I was mildly accelerating in 3rd (about 60 mph I think) when the cam came in and I decided to punch it. The wheels broke loose a little (not unusual, 205 tires), something snapped, and the tranny started to sound very unhealthy. Pulled over, tried all the gears, no luck, pushed it home (only about .5 mile away). No fun.

My thesis is due in a month so won't have any time to play with it for a while, so I guess 914 will become very familiar with his car cover for a while. Maybe I'll replace it with another inexpensive 901, maybe a 915 or G50? Any suggestions/experience? Another 901 seems very appealing at a $300 swap meet price vs. the probably close to $4000 for a 914 or G50 conversion done right.
