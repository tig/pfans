	Yup, they are.  Don't know about how to move them from one CV to the
other.

	Yes, but....  There are supposed to be gaskets in there, but a lot
of people leave them out (including my mechanic).  Some people have had a lot
more luck keeping the CV joint together (and not throwing *too* much grease
around) with no gasket than with.  If the CV and mating surface are flat, you
shouldn't have any real problems.  I haven't so far...
