     A recent inquiry was made to the list regarding Engine Storage.  I 
     posted this same inquiry two weeks ago and recieved these good 
     suggestions:
     
     1)   Using ordinary detergent oil, squirt into cylinders via sparkplug
          holes.   Rotate Engine regulary  (I do it once every two weeks)
     
     2)   Keep insects, dust, and rodents out of the engine.  I keep mine 
          on an engine stand in my garage, covered with a clean cotton 
          cover.
     
     3)   A good way of preserving the engine is to seal it in a plastic 
          bag, and include some of the water absorbing anti-dessicants.
     
     4)   Don't rely on WD-40 as a lubricant for the internals.  It is 
          designed to displace water only, and is too light a lube for 
          rings, etc.  Not a bad idea to coat entire exterior with it.
     
     5)   Drain fuel from fuel injection lines.  Easiest way to get it all 
          out is to take it apart at the injectors. The fuel "rail" is 
          already open to atmosphere
     
     6)   Try to store the engine in a dry area where the temperature 
          doesn't swing up and down.  This will minimize condensation.
     
     
     NO-NOs!!!!
     
     Don't wrap parts in cotton shop rags (or other water absorbing 
     fabrics)!!  An associate of mine greased up all the parts to his
     4-CAM (356) Carrera Engine and stored them for several years.  
     Everything was badly pitted with rust when he went to do the rebuild 
     since the cotton attracted water.
     
     DON'T block inlet and exhaust ports with Shop Rags either (same 
     reason).  Best to simply bag whole engine in plastic and use the 
     anti-dessicants.
     
     
     
     THE FINAL "DO" - Hurry up, quit dragging your *&(&, get that engine 
     back into a (runnuing) Porsche where it belongs!!!!!
     
     take care
