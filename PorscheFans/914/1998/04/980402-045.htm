  My understanding of this effect is limited, but on looking through
my various physics books, here is what I came up with, based on
reading from Sears and Zymanski, and Franklin Miller, Jr.:  

   The number of free electrons per unit volume present in any metal
is a function of two things: the temperature of the metal, and the
chemical composition of the metal.  When two dis-similar metals are
brought into contact, at the JUNCTION between the two metals a
potential difference exists, called the CONTACT POTENTIAL.   This is
because of the above mentioned difference in free electrons between
the two metals.  A free electron at the boundry experiences a net
force that tends to send it into one metal or the other, creating a
net unbalanced charge... the above mentioned CONTACT POTENTIAL.   

  As mentioned above, the contact potential depends not only on the
types of metals, but also on the TEMPERATURE of the junction; a
higher temperature means that the electrons have greater kinetic
energy and are thus less tightly bound into their respective metals. 
This results in a junction potential that is dependent on
temperature.

  The effect is reversable, and was discovered by a Frenchman, Jean
Peltier, whose name has popped up lately in connection with those
nifty no-moving-parts 12-volt-powered camp coolers.

  Basically, the amount of heat liberated or absorbed at the junction
depends on the polarity of current flowing through the junction, and
is given by the equation:

  Pi A B = Peltier heat (joules) / Q (coulombs)

  where Pi A B is the Peltier EMF (voltage) between two dis-similar
metals A and B, heat is the amount of heat liberated or absorbed at
the junction, and Q is the amount of charge moved through the
junction.   Empiracally, Pi A B depends not only on the nature of the
two metals, but also on their junction temperature.  

  So... inside that little crimp ring are two dissimilar metals that
are in intimate contact (crimped together inside the ring) and
insulated at the far end, where they connect to the harness conector
to take the resultant EMF up to the dashboard guage.  The gauge is in
reality a voltmeter, but it is calibrated to read the junction
temperature in degrees.

   ....and now I've told you more than I know...

					Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
