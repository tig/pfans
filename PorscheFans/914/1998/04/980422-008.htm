Do you actually have it apart yet, or are you looking at pictures? This is
what I did: Get 32mm combination wrench from Sears (really huge!), with the
shaft out of the tranny and the clutch installed in the engine (which would
be laying around on a dolly) with flywheel lock in place, stick the shaft
into the clutch. Note that the shaft is now prevented from turning. Support
the shaft right about at where the nut is with a milk crate or something
sturdy. You don't want to bend the shaft when you go to undo the nut. Unbend
the securing washer flap and undo the nut with the huge wrench. Simple.

Heh, you're screwed, dude. Unless you like the sound of very expensive parts
wearing very fast, give up and find a talented repair shop. It takes some
unavailable and very expensive tools to set that ring and pinion up
properly. Otherwise you'll get howling and a very short life out of the
thing. JCM transmissions (in Excellence classifieds) will set up a 901 ring
and pinion for 180 bucks. They are in Colorado.
