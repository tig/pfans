Hi Marc!

 I think that mike Cooley did have a procedure on this, but the
following works for me:

  The idle contact is between terminals 17 and 47 on the TPS.   If
you have a 
breakout box, this is terminals 17 and 11 on the ECU connector.  The
correct technique is to adjust for contacts just closing as the
throttle butterfly is returned to it's closed position.  There is a
travel direction sensor switch that detects whether the throttle is
moving in the opening or closing direction, and this switch is in
series with the idle detection contacts, so that any movement of the
throttle toward opening should defeat the idle detection contacts
regardless of throttle switch position adjustment. 
  However, to prevent premature activation of the "idle" mode on
throttle closure,
the adjustment should be made.
  In actual practice, the points at which the switch itself forms a
mechanical stop and the point where the idle detection contacts close
are very close together, so that all that is really necessary is to
verify that there is a reliable 0 ohms between 17 and 47 on throttle
closure, and that this does not appear very much before full seating
of the butterfly valve in the closing direction.
  The easiest procedure seems to be to rotate the switch with the
throttle closed 
until 0 ohms is observed, lock it down at that point, and then verify
correct
adjustment by ensuring that 0 ohms always appears just before the
throttle fully closes.  If the 0 ohms reading is not reliable, tweak
the switch position a bit and test again.

  Hope this helps.
                                                  Regards,
                                                  Jim T.
