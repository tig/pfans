List,
Got me a new toy. 1974 1.8 with the 96mm Big Bore Kit and a LOT more. This
is the way it should be. WOW. Fun at last.
So its' not a six. When you have been strapped for 3 long years  like I have
been, without anything that would go beyond the block, life is good again.
I went for a ride on some of the backroads and will not tell you what I was
moving at because I was breaking the law. I did drive in a safe manner,
looking well ahead of me, around many bends in those winding roads. The only
thing I saw was cattle that were fenced in the huge pastures in that rural area.
My Questions were directed at this machine I now possess for your info. Have
read all that were in the mail and I thank all of you for your help and will
use the advice some gave me for a remedy.

As Dave says, V-A-R-O-O-M.

Thanks from a HAPPY new kid who is only 62 living like it's 1970 again.

Mike
