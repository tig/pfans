I can't say that I ever used the unisyn device to sync my carbs, but I
believe in the synchrometer. One thing though, don't quickly rev the
engine with the things on the carbs. There's a ball bearing that weighs
down the needle that can be launched out of its plastic housing and get
subsequently sucked into the carb and into the engine. It also ruins the
synchrometer, obviously. Ask me why I know. SIGH. I can imagine all
sorts of dimples on the surfaces of the head and piston on one cylinder
of my 912 which were created before the ball hopefully exited out the
exhaust valve. Sometimes I have to wonder why I can be so brainless. At
least I get to make the real stupid mistakes on the relatively cheap
four cylinder Porsches before I wreak havok on 911 engines. Uh oh, watch
out.

	On a somewhat related note, could somebody share the proper method of
setting up the throttle switch on a 2.0? I have an idea on how to do
this with an ohmmeter, but I want to confirm the exact methods before I
investigate other sources of occasional bucking on my car. Mike Cooley,
was it you who had this information?

Thanks all,

Marc Le Friant.
