Howdy all 60 of you...hahaha

I'd ask Andy about how to count us. He probably knows how. I dont have a
clue. How about you be 1 ! and Rich and be 2 ! and I'll be 3 ! and the
note keeps going....hahaha Im only kidding :  )

I think its different for each of us; I have never been bumped off ,
well maybe in my early days on line, but I did know how to used this
pile of plastic and chips, But have been over loaded with email messages
at a time (300!) a Day, I just delet and read on. Wonder if that guy
ever sold those seats ??

All in All I really like the list and dont really mind using the delet
key to enjoy the benifits of the list

Later, Just my 2 cents =8^P
