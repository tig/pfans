Someone previously posted about removing the parking brake lever from the
body of the caliper. He mentioned that he removed a disc on the opposite
side and was then able to get the lever out. He then said that he brazed the
hole he had made in the disc and re-installed it. I lost your post, could
you comment on this? I tried removing that disc (cover) and was not
successful, or rather I was afraid to break something. What did you use to
get that thing out? I'd hate to have to throw these things away because of
this little niggling problem.

Dirk Wright, not certified, but definitely certifiable!
