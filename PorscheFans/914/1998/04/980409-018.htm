	<Ed Villela asked...>
>Some questions for the list: with all of this talk about compression rat=
ios, I
have brand new Mahle 2.0L euro pistons. They have a slight dish on top, =
looks
like 1 to 1.5 cc w/o actually measuring. There is a bold blue number 8 =
on the
tops. My question is when I measure the deck height, do I measure from =
the
dished center of the piston or the raised outer edge of the piston to the=
 top
of the barrel??

Ed, are you sure they are Mahle 2.0 Euro's?  That dish you describe on =
the top sounds just like mine! (my dish measured to 1.5 cc).  Problem is,=
 I don't know what I have.  The pelican Website shows a picture of a Mahl=
e euro but it has a flat top.  Jim T. has a great spreadsheet for cc calc=
ulations and has euro pistons with a 4 cc dish on top.  His are Kolbensch=
midts.

As for the measuring,  Use the JJ method.   I had mine still attached to =
the rods and in the barrels.  I turned the motor on it's side, (forgot =
about the lifters on the bottom- they all fell out)  I cut out a piece =
of Plexiglass smaller than the 94mm (all you need to do is cover the pist=
on dish).  Drill a hole in the middle and with a small graduated cylinder=
 or a small hyperdermic (without the needle) fill the dish with a fluid. =
 I used salad oil as I thought it was easier to clean if I spilled.  Easy=
 to make accurate measurements!

Let me know if they do turn out to be Mahles as I would love to know what=
 I have.

Thanks!
