If I remember correctly, it's 15 lb-ft.  I would be very careful when
tightening them, though.  The studs (in my experience) pull out of the heads
pretty easily.  I battled a loose exhaust for many months, and finally my
mechanic spent about 2 hours with pry bars and a blow torch, and managed to
get everything seated just right.  I think it's time to make a return trip
to my mechanic...

   Well, I've got a leak at some exhaust port on mine right now. I
pulled the exhaust off in order to get at the push rod tube seals, and
have tried twice to get the heat exchangers on without a leak. I know
that it's a small leak, you can hear it at idle, but when the engine is
revved or thoroughly warmed, it seems a lot less. Does anyone know the
right torque setting for the exhaust manifold nuts? I can't seem to find
it anywhere. I started with 10 #'s and am now at 14, what's right?  At
least the seals and valve covers don't leak anymore, and my heater no
longer emits clouds of blue.
                                                     Jim S.
