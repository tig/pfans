Hi Mike!

You asked:

> Can someone give me a written meaning of dynamic timing? Static
timing?

  I think that I can do this...   

 Static timing, as the name implies, is done with the engine not
running.   This means that there are no changes to the timing due to
either vacuum or centrifugal advance mechanisms, and only the
position of the distributor relative to it's internal shaft is taken
into account.

   The technique requires connecting a static timing light (12 volt
bulb or test light) or a voltmeter between the points (- terminal on
the coil) and ground.   With the ignition on, if the points are open,
then there will be current supplied to the light (through the coil
primary) and the light will illuminate.  When the points are closed,
they constitute a short across the light, and thus it will go out.
   The procedure is to obtain the static timing specification (for
most 914's, I believe that it's 5 degrees BTDC) and rotate the engine
by hand to this point.  Note the direction that the distributor shaft
rotates when the engine is rotated in it's normal direction.   Turn
the ignition on and observe the light across the points.  Loosen the
distributor clamp bolt and rotate the distributor body in the SAME
direction as the shaft's normal rotation.   This is the RETARD
direction; the light should go out, indicating the points are closed.
 Rotate the distributor body back the other way, that is, opposite to
the shaft's normal rotation.   This is the ADVANCE direction; rotate
until the indicator light just illuminates.   This is the point at
which the spark would be generated.  Lock the distributor in this
position.   If you wish to double check, repeat the procedure, but
always approach the points opening position by rotating the
distributor body in the oposite direction to normal shaft rotation;
this removes any error due to hysteresis (play) in the distributor
drive.

  Static timing is a good thing to do when putting an engine together
for the first time or when replacing the distributor; it ensures that
the timing will be close enough for the engine to run.   However,
dynamic timing is the preferred method, as it is better to have
correct timing at high engine speeds rather than low.

   Which brings us to dynamic timing, or, as it's name implies,
timing with the engine running.   This technique is stroboscopic in
nature; i.e. a strobe light is fired in synchronism with the spark,
and the intensity of the light is high enough that the iris in your
eye stops down to the point that you can't see anything except when
the light is on.   Of course, the light is on for only a brief period
at the point where the spark occurs, and if the timing mark for the
correct number of degrees advance is in a position to be illuminated
when the light fires, then it will be seen "frozen", or apparently
standing still.   If the spark is occuring to soon (advanced) then
the "frozen" timing mark will be illuminated BEFORE it gets to the
reference notch,  we can see that it is not lined up, and can change
the distributor position to correct it.
   Conversely, if the spark occurs to late (retarded), then the mark
will have already gone by the reference notch by the time it is
illuminated.   Again, we rotate the distributor body to correct.

   Dynamic timing ensures that the vacuum and centrifugal advance
mechanisms are contributing the correct anount of advance at 3500 RPM
(for the 914) so the timing is correct at high speed.   If there is a
problem in the centrifugal or vacuum advance systems, then the timing
cannot be made correct both statically and dynamically at the same
time.   Unless you have just gotten your distributor back from a
speed shop with one of the fancy calibration machines, there will
usually be some difference in the two types of timing, hence the
preference for dynamic timing.

   Hope this is of some help.

                                                            Jim T.
