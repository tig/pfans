First, a huge "Thanks" to Dave Darling and Scot Douglas for helping to
sort of the problems with the 1.8 F.I.  Both suggested a ground of one
sort or another, so returned from a business trip Friday night, traced
each of the engine wiring harnesses wires back and found the faulty wire
(broken inside the jacket).  Three minutes later the engine was running
flawlessly.  Thanks to all for the suggestions!

Background to this problem was that I sold my 1.8 to a college transfer
student from Germany who needed a solid 1.8 engine (his didn't just
"leak" oil - it "gushed" oil to the point that Texaco wanted to cap it
as a geyser:-). Part of the deal was that I'd install the engine for him
- which we accomplished in only a couple of hours.  His is a beautiful
'75 baby blue 914 from Arizona (read "very little rust".)

The great part about helping him out was that his 914 spent most of the
weekend with me.  I felt *obligated* to put about 50-80+ miles on the
car just to be sure that the engine was in tune and that nothing would
come loose (I couldn't think of any other reasons, could you?;-) In
driving those miles, I was reminded of what makes the 914 special to
it's owners and admirers - the handling.  Certainly the 1.8 is no
rocket, but that isn't the point. The point is the "fun factor" - pure,
top off, 'round town fun driving.  Now I can't wait to get mine back on
the road - which should be in the next couple of weeks.

YIPPEEE!
John Dunkle
