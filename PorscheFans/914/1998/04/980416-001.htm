	I got a box from the guys at Pelican yesterday.  My order was in.
One of the items I ordered was a throttle switch.  I was hoping that that
would take care of my surging problem.
	Replacement was fairly straghtforward with the throttle body out
of the car.  (I had swapped in my spare TB earlier.)  All you have to do
is remove the two screws, and then PULL HARD on the switch to get it off
of the throttle shaft.  Mine was really on there, and did NOT want to be
removed!
	I used the "continuity tester" feature of my DMM (Digital Multi-
Meter) to adjust the switch.  When there's continuity between the two
probes, the meter beeeeeeeeps at you.  I purposely set the switch so that
the idle contacts were just making contact when the throttle valve was
all the way closed.
	Turns out that was not necessarily a great idea.  It appears as
if the contacts weren't always making contact at idle, which caused some
funny behavior--including some surging!  So at lunch, I dug in with my DMM
again, and set the switch according to the factory procedure.  I turned
the switch just to the point where the circuit was closing.  Then I turned
it another ~2 degrees (one index mark on the screw-holes) so that the idle
contacts are shorted when the throttle is just *barely* open, as well as
when it is closed.
	Some real dexterity is required to do this adjustment when the
throttle body is on the engine.  I had to hold both probes on the pins in
the switch (that I couldn't see because they were upside down!) with one
hand, and move the throttle with the other hand, and twist the switch with
my third hand, and...  You see what I mean about dexterity?
	The surging is almost gone, now.  It now only happens when the car
is just cruising at 1500 RPM.  And since I don't drive at that RPM much if
at all, I think I can live with it.  I might try re-adjusting the switch
to see if that changes the behavior.

	Idea for a throttle switch tester:  One of those five-pin plastic
elecrical plugs, with two wires coming out of it.  The two wires have
alligator clips on the ends.  You could clip them onto the DMM, and then
just plug the plug into the switch.  Hands-free, you could then concen-
trate on setting the switch, rather than on hodling everything in place.
Now all I have to do is find a spare plastic plug...
