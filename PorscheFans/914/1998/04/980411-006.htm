This is almost exactly how mine is, and I'm running under the same
assumption as you.  I've got a '76 2.0, but it's still a d-jet.  Mine will
only die maybe 1 out of 50 times, and after it gets pretty warm (over
half-way on the center console temp gauge), it will actually die less often.
I'm hoping to run my car into a mechanic with a "known-good" exhaust gas
analyser (I'm not so sure about my last mechanic's).  I've found that if the
car does die, it will start fine if I hold the throttle completely open
while starting.  If you want to avoid a trip to the mechanic's, I can think
of a couple things that you could try to verify this condition.  First,
check the resistance of the head temp sensor both when cold and when warm.
If I remember correctly, it should be about 2500 ohms when cold, and around
350 ohms when warm.  You could also run the car at about 60 mph for a
minute, and then carefully shut the motor off and coast to the side in
nuetral.  Then, pull the spark plugs and see if they're white (as opposed to
a slight tan).  If they are, then you're lean.  On last thing... I think
every car I've ever owned has run stronger when cold.  I've come to accept
this as normal, since both the intake air is colder (more oxygen), and the
engines are typically setup to run richer when cold (which means a little
more power, but worse emissions and gas mileage).  I think this is also why
the emissions places require the engine to be warm before the test.  Does
this sound right?
