Todd, 
I dont know if you really have been misinformed or not, I too have heard
the argument, why early is better than late, but I have to disagree.
Yes the early hubs have the embossments and yeah thats cool and yes
probably is stronger, but I dont thing you will ever break a restuded
late hub. I have used late restuded hubs with out a problem. All my
914-6 conversion buddys have late hubs and one is a 3.6L race car with
late hubs and stock 4 banger CV and the car is going on 10 years in this
configuration with NO breakage, so save a few bucks and restud your late
syle hubs and dont worry about it.
Just my two cents, 

Don
"73 914-6 GT (Now looking for a 3.2L, with cash in HAND!) and yes its
still in the shop getting Flares ;  (
Its getting close..........
