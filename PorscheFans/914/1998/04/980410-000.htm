To check the deck height on domed pistons, the method I learned for my
912 is to get a relatively thick diameter section of solder to fish
through the spark plug holes and crush between the piston and the head.
Measure the crushed section with a caliper and then figure out what you
need to add to the shims. When my father cc's heads, I notice he uses
Marvel Mystery Oil. May be just what he has around, but I think the
reason he uses it over any other oil is that it's easier to see in a
burette (sp?). To JJ- before going into rebuilding your TB, try going
through it and seeing where it's binding. I did this to my sticking
throttle body and found the problem lay in the built-in return spring. I
sprayed some lube on the spring, worked it in, and haven't had any more
problems so far. And for whoever needed to disconnect the trip odometer
from his speedo, why not take out the cable at the gauge instead of
removing it at the dash? Anyway, I ramble on...
