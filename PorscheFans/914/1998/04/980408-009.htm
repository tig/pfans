Ed & I have finally figured out the final schedule of events for the
gathering in Virginia on June 12th, 13th & 14th.  All the updated
information can be found at http://www.wgss.com/914/ramble.htm .  A
couple of quick comments are:

Nick in Bethesda Maryland has generously offered his house as a common
meeting area for those who will be coming through that area.  You can
email Nick directly at the following address: 105515.2077@compuserve.com
for more information and if you'd like to join the caravan down from
Nick's home.  Thanks Nick!

Also, the hotel is getting a lot of requests for reservations and we are
only able to hold 40 rooms at the group rate till early May.  So if you
haven't made your reservations yet (which you need to do!), please make
them as soon as possible.  The event is at the Founder's Inn at
1-800-926-4466 or 1-757-424-5511 - and please them you are with the
"Porsche Meeting" to get the discounted rates.

Ed & I hope to see a lot of the list members present to finally be able
to put a face with an e-mail address...

Thanks!

John
