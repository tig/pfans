	My 74 1.8 (early; built in 10/73) only had the one fitting on the
throttle body as well.  (Many 74 2.0s also only have the one fitting, some
of the later 2.0s do as well.)
	My speculation is that VW and Porsche decided that it would be a
lot cheaper and easier to use the same vacuum cannister (or dashpot) for
all the Type IVs (and possibly other Volksies--I think Type IIIs at least)
rather than come up with a separate part for those cars not using the vacc
advance.  So the fitting on the advance side of the dashpot (the side that
points away from the distributor body) is simply left disconnected.
	The distributor dashpot does not allow air to flow through it
(unless it is broken internally), so it should not cause a vaccuum leak to
leave the one fitting disconnected.
