In a message dated 98-04-09 03:32:08 EDT, you write:

<< With the piston at TDC, measure the clearance between the
 straight-edge and the piston top with a feeler gauge.
 
   Since you are trying to measure the clearance between the piston
 and the "deck" (flat part of head above cylinder... not part of
 combustion chamber), you of course measure to the highest point on
 the piston, as that is the part that will strike the head if the
 clearance is 0 or negative.  I do not know quite how you would do
 this with domed pistons, but most of the ones that seem to be out
 there are either dished or flat, so the rim of the dish is the
 appropriate place.
 
 					Good Luck,
                                                             Jim T. >>
Thank you Jim, I thought the outer egde was the correct place to measure from,
but I figure its better to ask than guess.
