Greetings, 914-er's!

   I have been reading the thread about what happens to the engine
during deceleration, and I will have to agree with Dave D.  .....  
The engine's fuel is not completely shut off.   I quote from a Bosch
reprint on the D-Jet system:

   Overrun

Combustion is continued during
overrun because the emission of
noxious components in exhaust
gasses is lower than if an engine
is restarted after its combustion
chamber has cooled down as a
result of combustion having been
stopped.  Since there is a poorer
mixing of air and fuel in a cooled
combustion chamber, if com-
bustion is interrupted, renewed
ignition would result in the emis-
sion of an unacceptably large
amount of incompletely burned
and thus noxious components in
the exhaust gas.  In addition, in
engines fitted with exhaust gas
catalyzers, the danger would arise
that these catalyzers would burn
through.     

  End Bosch quote.
                                  

  Hope I haven't muddied the waters too much.

					Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
