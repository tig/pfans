Dave, The April fool was about me saying the list could buy me the machinery
and supplies and I would be the lists own personal machinist.You and the
others on the list would never do that to an old joker like me. Now that I
read it again, it is not as funny as it seemed when I wrote it. 

I am an old man, 62, and have seen better days. If what I write now is good
information, you should have known me, if you were old enough, back in the 70's.
My 914 days then were fun, learning was at every stop in the road. 

Ever had the gear shift pop off in your hand when racing in the low range or
wonder why your lights mysteriously go dark in the middle of a stormy night
on a mountain road with more twists than a coiled spring, miles from
anywhere? That the 914 will only float for a minute or two when leaving the
pavement doing stupid things while at the lake like running full throttle at
the boat ramp to show how good the new brakes work when not done right? 
I got this BIG guy mad at Porkys one night. He went to open my door and the
handle was too much for his brain as he pulls the whole damn thing hard
enough, snaps off and he falls backwards and dents the fender on his Vette.
My head hurt for well over a week. I guess I learned then not to give the
bird to someone parked next to you. Those things and a lot more teach you,
but when you think back, that was fun.

Speaking of fun, my wife is calling me. 

Later, Varoom, but not much later.

Mike
