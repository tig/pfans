Boges hydraulic are cheap (not as cheap as KYB), but softer than KYB.

You can't paint chrome directly . You have to have the chrome removed by
blasting, then paint it.

I haven't had the chance to do this yet. The Haynes Weber manual has the
procedure.

Have the Ben Gay ready when you're finished. It is a contortionists
nightmare. You'll need universal joints for the sockets, plus stubby
wrenches. You have to take the instrument cluster out, of course. There are
2 or 3 nuts behind it in addition to the several others that hold the dash
in. You have to remove the lower knee pad first, there are nuts behind it also.

Spray wax, like Eastwood's HD antirust and Cosmoline's Weathershed shoudl
work fine. Rub with a cloth before it sets.
