I used '547' when I rebuilt my 2.0l last year.  Yeh, it does work great and
cost me a whole $7.99 at my local autoparts place.  And I still had half
the tube left over after I finished putting everything together.  This is
one of the reasons I DON'T like the larger Porsche mailorder suppliers
anymore.  The more I've gotten into this hobby (for the past 5 years), the
more I've come to realize that the best way to obtain parts is from fellow
list members, local FLAPS and the smaller mail order shops like Pelican,
GPR, etc.  This wasn't meant to start a 'who's better' war, but the big
boys never cease to amaze me at how much they can charge.  Even my favorite
local Porsche dealer (Stoddard's, ever heard of them?) is cheaper than
automashin, performance, tweeks and auto atlanta.  OK, off my box....
