Does this sound familiar to anyone? My 1.7 runs great almost all the time.
When the engine is not really hot, it idles between 1500 and 2000, a little
high, but doesn't bother me, and I'm so new at this I haven't even bothered
to adjust anything yet. But what does bother me is this: After a 30 mile
drive on the interstate (I'm sure the engine is quite hot), the engine
barely idles at stops, you have to keep reving it a little to keep it from
dying, and if it does quit, is very hard to start again, though it will if
you almost floor it while starting.

On some days, I would swear the car has a bit more pickup when cold than
when warmed up. That's not right, is it? Too lean when hot?????
