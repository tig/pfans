	A common cause of this behavior in D-jet engines (1.7, 2.0) is an
air leak.  You didn't mention which kind of engine or fuel system you
have.  Is it a 1.8 with L-jet?

	The mention of "brain to the points" makes me think that this may
be a 1.8 with L-jetronic injection.  If so, then you have fewer places to
check.  One is (still) the aux air valve.  Make sure that it is routed
correctly (from the pipe between the air meter and the throttle to the
manifold after the throttle), and that it closes when the engine is warmed
up.  Next would be the decel valve over on the right-hand side of the
engine compartment, below and aft of the battery.  Again, the bigger hoses
go from before the throttle to after it.  And there should be no air coming
though the valve under normal operations--just at high RPMs with the throt-
tle closed.
	Could the throttle switch (tells the ECU when the throttle is
closed) have this sort of effect?  Anyone?
	Another thing to do might be to check your timing.  Advanced timing
will cause a high idle.  Put a big, easily-visible mark on your fan next
to the timing mark, then see if the timing retards reasonably when you
close the throttle.  I don't know what reasonable would be, but if it
stays at full advance at idle, you know there's something wrong there.

	Good luck!
