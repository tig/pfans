  Thanks Brian.

   I did find the timing marks on the inside of the impeller
  and looking for them using a mirror. I need to mark the
  side across from the marks so I can see them without the
  mirror. Now that I understand better what I'm looking at
  I see that the Haynes manual picture shows where each fan
  blade is 5deg. So you go out 5.5 blades from TDC and that
  is approx. 27deg.
