So I decided to detach it from the transmission since I'd have to eventually to take the transmission out anyways. As soon as I pulled it away from the transmission, all the balls of the CV joint and what remained of its case fell out on the floor! Horray! Since when do 914 repairs turn out to be LESS than you anticipated?!?!

	Hey , I've been there.  I could tell it was the cv joint
because I could but the car in gear, get out of it while it was
running, and see that one axle was turning and not the other.  It was
the right outside joint.   
	I don't know what the standard repair method is, but i used a 
length of pipe and a hammer to get the stub axle off after I removed
te nut.  I understand it is bad to roll the car or make any movement
with the stub axle out.  The bearing is destroyed.  I hope this helps.

bad enough to destroy cv joints too!!
