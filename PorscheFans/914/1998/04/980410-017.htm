I agree with Mike M.  I really have no idea what a "reasonable offer" would
be.  Based on my experiences, used throttle bodies can be had for $30-$60,
depending upon condition.  It seems to me that Mike C. would be restoring
slightly damaged throttle bodies to new (if not better) condition, so I
would imagine that a price somewhere in the above mentioned range would be
suitable.  Mike C., can you tell us how much you used to charge?  BTW, count
me in as one of the sixty.

Thanks again,

Mr Cooley-
I think your offering to do the throttle bodies of the world is a wonderful
thing.  I would like you to do my throttle body so count me in!  But, I do
feel funny about the money thing.  I think the best thing to do since your
doing the lists TB's is we all aggree on the correct amount, have a set
price and lets get them all done.  Besides, having never paid to have my
TB's massaged before, I have no idea what current market conditions are.
Just my thoughts.  What say you listers?
