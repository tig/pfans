Wayne: I received the carpeting and the replacement windshield seal yesterday.
Both look great! Now to my continuing problem with the 1.8. As I told you
previously, had to have the car towed to the local vw guru place where after
two days of diagnosis they said it was a bad fuel pump. Waited three days for
the fuel pump they ordered. Put on the new pump. Wasn't he problem. Now it was
the throttle body, wanted to order a new one. Fortunatley i had an extra.
Wasn't the problem. Now remember, I thought all along that the problem was
ignitiion. They finally agree. They replac the pertronix with points, car
runs. Pick up the car last night. Bill is $617.56. I pay it. Drive car home,
Now as I shift from second to third at about 3,000 rpm, engine goes to red
line, finally drops back down. I finally get it home and I am pissed. They
left the car out at night although I told the guys I would pay extra to have
it in the shop at nights. I wash the car and notice two belt buckle type
scratchs that go all the way to bare metal. Now I am really pissed since I had
one of those cloth backed vinyl aprons in the trunk and told the guys to
please use the damn thing.

Needless to say, I have been screwed. I think that either the decell valve
(isn't that the one on the passenger side of the engine below the battery) is
bad, or they have messed with the air flow sensor. What do you think?
