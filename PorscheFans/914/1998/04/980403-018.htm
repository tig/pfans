I recently had this 'hack' job done on a set of rear late-style hubs by a
fellow list member, Rich Johnson.  I would like to say that the work Rich
did on these hubs far exceeded my expectations.  The metal taken away was
minimal, and done consistently on both hubs.  The studs are all straight
and true and fit perfectly inside my wheels.  I hate to say it, but these
hubs came back in better shape than if I would have cleaned them up and
painted them myself. I've even jacked the car up and taken a wheel off to
show a few friends the workmanship on the hubs. 

Thanks again Rich, nice job.
