I have a few questions.

1. If looking for a SMOOTH comfortable ride, but on a SMALL budget, what is
my best choice on shocks and cartdridge inserts and the 914 source?

2.Has anyone had any luck with black over the chrome door handles, or any of
the chrome trim. If so, what method? Paint? Source?

3. Process of syncro of dual 40 webers. Is there a recommended method by any
of the list members who have these, who do it themself? A foolproof
prodedure for an old dummy, ME?

4. Dash renewal, not the cover. Any advice on the difficulty and step by
step mode of instruction of installing a NEW dash? Any pitfalls?

5. Hanging things. Under the rear, the speedometer and clutch cable, other
cables. These hang down on most 914's I see around here. What is the best
tie points or whatever to keep them hidden but still functioning without
binding? A direct route description needed immediately.

6. Protection of good metal in engine compartment bay. Without any rust
present, what is a good method of insuring it stays that way? I am not
considering any removal of any part to accomplish this. I want to also
include the weber linkage to keep it in a brillant sheen as installed.

I seek this information to insure what I have remains within my budget. I am
retired, so please consider this if you respond. Naturally there will be
those who question frugality but this is necessary for me. I am refering to
the engine area protection cost and smoothness of ride dollar wise.

Thanks.
