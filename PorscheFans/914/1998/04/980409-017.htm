Dirk,
It was you. I would have found out but I thank you for letting me know. You
went through a lot of time and effort to set up a neat deal for all, like
you did. Thanks for sharing with Travis and with others who WILL NOW see
your efforts.
 
Now your secret is out how you can be so quick with all those answers. I was
thinking that you must never sleep in order to provide good info. :-))))

There are several like you that keep the rest of us perking right along. I
won't get into OTHER names, but it is essential that WE ALL THANK ALL OF YOU
so ALL of you will know your EFFORTS ARE NOT WASTED AND ALWAYS ARE APPRECIATED.

THANKS.

Mike
