JJ,

That's exactly what happened to me last year after I re-installed the
engine.  All I did was crawl under the suspect heat exchanger, loosen the
nuts, wiggle it around a little, and tightened them back up.  I did have
the help of a small flashlight in my mouth at the same time.  I was able to
tell exactly which cylinder was leaking because of the charred black
surface on an otherwise brand new copper gasket.

No leaks since.

Good luck,

Dion
