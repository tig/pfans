I own both a '73 with hiperf 2.1, cam, balanced crank, etc., and two '76
2.0.  The most recent car had a '73 2.0 engine with carbs (yuk) until I
pulled it for correct engine.  It is waiting...  Two of the three cars
will be for sale come July.

The late cars have a smog pump which dumps cold air into the exhaust. 
It's best to remove the drive belt between smog checks so you don't wear
out hard to find, useless parts.  Doesn't take any power that way,
either.  The EGR does not rob power, just adds a little plumbing.  
Most late cars also have a CAT and a different exhaust setup.  The
exhaust headers are longer, but they give you a much better cabin
heater.  Well worth it, even here in SoCalif.

If a late car is anemic, it probably has the original CAT, which is NLA.
Not to fret, as the 924 unit bolts right in, and is now a 3-way unit,
which guarantees low emissions, and is not at all restrictive.  Last
year I had to smog my son's Vanagon.  Found the CAT was a pile of
rubble, replaced it, and then it passed with flying colors.

My daily driver '76 with hyd lifters and 924 CAT feels as strong as any
stock '73-74 I have ever driven.  It is really smooth, too.	

NUSUB:
As for overheating, the posts so far are real good.  I would add that
the engine perimeter seal is absolutely necessary, especially the right
side.  A leaking tranny once demonstrated to me how air from behind the
engine sucks up the right side and into the engine if the perimeter seal
is bad or missing.  The faster you go, the more hot air gets sucked in.

If you don't want to drop the engine to install new, expensive OEM 
perimeter seal, then pipe insulation from Home Despot can be slit and
slipped in place quite easily.

Back to the Speedster - 1915 Model T Ford with dual radiator (groan).
