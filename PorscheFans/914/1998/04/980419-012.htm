As I understand it.......

First, we have to talk about the dynamics of the exploding gasoline
inside your engine.

In a perfect world, the explosion would produce continuous, even
pressure on the top of the piston, starting right at top dead 
center (TDC), and ending immediatly at bottom dead center (BDC).
Much the way a leg pushes on a bicycle crank.

Exploding gasoline doesnt work that way.  Instead, you get a sharp
bang, and a fast trail off.  And to make it worse, there's a build
up to the bang.  Sort of like a very fast Whoomp.

So, you have to start the explosion before TDC, so that the biggest
part of the whoomp happens right at, or just after, TDC.

How much TIME before, you ask?  Well, that _depends_.  It depends mostly
on how much gas vapor there is to burn.  And how much vapor there
is depends on how you're driving the car.  (And a whole bunch of
lesser factors I choose not to discuss here!)

What does this have to do with 'dynamic timing'?  Simple:

There are no timers in the motor.  But you do have a very accurate
engine position indicator; the distributor.  So you control the TIME
allowed for the explosion by having the spark happen a certain number
of degrees before TDC.  AKA, spark advance.

And there is a pretty easy conversion between TIME before TDC and
DEGREES
before TDC.  It just depends on engine speed.

Dynamic timing is having the spark happen at just the right time, so
that under all of the driving conditions and engine speeds, the peak
of the whoomp happens at just the right time.  (Extra credit for the
alert student:  Point out wht centripidal-only advance works properly
only in race motors.  Hint:  Racers don't use middle throttle
positions.)

How does one set dynamic timing?  Typically, it's a comprimise.  You
set the timing so that the motor runs very well for the driving that's
most important to you, and reasonably well in the other areas.

If you're REALLY serious, you recurve your distributor using a dyno.
You adjust the weights, the springs on the weights, and the vacuum
control arms until it you're sure you've 'got IT'.

Or, if you're like me, you set it to 27 deg BTDC at 3500 rpm with the
hoses off, and if it 'don't seem right', you re-build the distrubutor
to factory specs.

Did this help?
