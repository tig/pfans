	I talked with a local "200 HP 2.0 914 time trialer", as he
referred to himself.  He has a lot of things to say about operating
temps at high-speed events.
	Keep in mind that the particular car is a real monster that
runs at 7K RPM (and maybe a bit more!) most of the time.
	First for CHT:  He has no idea on that, because all he uses
is EGT (exhaust gas temp).  He says it's a much better indicator of
what is happening in the engine.  He says that 1400 is as high as
he wants to go, and he tries for 1350 to have some safety margin.
And there is such a thing as too cool--1200, for example, is.
	For oil temps:  He has a calibrated sender down in the sump
where the stock sender is.  He uses 250 as an absolute limit for oil
temps.  If it goes over that, he slows down and cools off.  He also
considers that oil as "dead", and changes it when he gets into the
pits.  (Or possibly at the end of the weekend?)  He didn't mention if
it was dino or synthetic.
	For an oil cooler, he considers it a must for all serious time
tiralers to have an "oil cooler block-off plate" (not sure if that
means losing the stock cooler or not) and a reasonable-sized radiator-
type cooler somewhere in fresh air--not, for example, on the engine
lid.  He may only mean "time trialers with big-HP motors", or he may
mean everyone.  Not sure.  He suggests High Performance House in this
area as someone who knows about the block-off plates and how to keep
high-output motors cool enough.

	One question he asked was:  What heat range of spark plugs are
you hi-temp guys using?  You might try a cooler plug, like an 8 or 9
heat-range plug.
