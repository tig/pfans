Hi Jim!

You asked:

  If you are going to install the VDO aftermarket oil pressure gauge,
the following is how I did mine; it seemed to work out well for me.

From my files:

I seem to recall a thread on the list about how to install the VDO
aftermarket electronic oil pressure gauge.  I, too ran into the same
problem just the
other day as I was approaching the  critical point in assembling the
engine and 
needed to determine how I was going to thread that hose into the
engine 
case through that hole in the sheet metal, and get it tight enough
not to leak.
    An interesting observation came to light at this point.  The nuts
on the supplied 
piece of hose that came with my kit were 9/16" ....  NOT 14 mm!  A
little closer
observation determined that the thread on the end of the hose that's
supposed to 
screw into the engine case is 1/8" NPT, or close enough that it makes
no difference.
  Neither my hose nor the VDO sensor itself would screw into the case
as far 
as the original oil pressure switch before getting tight, but neither
seemed to
damage the threads for the original switch either;  I believe the
principal difference is
 in the degree of taper. For all practical purposes, the oil pressure
switch hole in my
 early production '74 2.0 litre is 1/8" NPT. 

  I also spoke to a friend of mine  who has lots of experience in the
mechanical world, and he said he ran into the same thing on Japanese
cars...
 apparently the Metric world has no standard for pipe (i.e. tapered)
threads, so where
 you find them, they are U.S. !  How convenient!
 
    I went up to my FLAPS and bought a 1-1/2' brass nipple in 1/8"
NPT and a 1/8" NPT threaded coupling with a hex nut molded into it's
outside.  I 
threaded the nipple into the coupling as far as I could (using a
wrench and vice grips,
 but no pipe dope or teflon tape) and then flowed solder around the
threads at the 
joint.  This makes it oil tight, and ensures that the whole thing
always unscrews
from the engine case, and not the coupling from the nipple.  This
assembly
is easy to insert through the engine tin hole and thread into the
case.  The hose that
 goes with the gauge then screws nicely into the other side of the
coupling.  It is a 
bit of a tight squeeze past the distributor cap clip, but it is still
possible to get the 
cap on and off.  The whole thing can be accessed with wrenches or
sockets from 
above the tin and removed and re-installed easily.

  I mounted the sending unit via it's supplied clamp to the upper
coil mounting bolt.
It is necessary to grind a little off the end of the clamp, thereby
squaring up the
rounded end and allowing it to clear the coil mounting clamp.

  I used an eyelet terminal under a slightly longer bolt to mount the
upper coil clamp
 foot and  the VDO sender clamp together.  A short length of wire
from the above
eylet to another eyelet terminal grounded to the fan shroud completes
the 
installation.

  I also used a "street L" or "street elbow" on the oil pressure
sending unit, pointed 
up.  This allows the hose to describe an upside down "U" from the
engine to the
sender, which makes the installation fairly neat and keeps the hose
away from the 
distributor cap, allowing easier access for ignition tune-ups.


					Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
