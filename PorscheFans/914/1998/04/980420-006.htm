My 914-4 is running hot.  It runs fine around town, but after an hour or 
more on the road the temp guage stays around 3/4 hot(not quite in the 
red).  The car, a newly painted silver '76, is in Virginia.  I want to 
bring it to New York City (6hrs away) where I live, and the last thing I 
need is an engine blowing mishap along the Jersey Turnpike.

My mechanic, and the guy who sold me the car, thinks that the engine is 
covered with dirt and oil grime. When we took the cap off to check the 
timing we noticed alot of grime around the cooling fan area as well as 
some missing blades on the fan.  He wants to pull the engine out, clean 
the fins and replace the cooling fan. 

Does this seem feasable?  Is this the problem or could there be another 
culprit?

Thanks for any help,
Vance
