I put the engine with attached transmission housing back in the car
yesterday just to get them out of the way in my tiny cramped rent-a-garage.
Before I did that, I did some rust repair and rustproofing in the engine
compartment. The words that kept coming to mind were "abject stupidity."
Anyone that would design a car such that the inner body cavities were open
to rain ought to be shot, in my opinion.

You know where the 2 white plastic "buckets" that are in the rear wall of
the engine bay, where the latches from the targa top hide when it's stowed
in the trunk? Just below each those in the engine bay is a hole. If you
spray rustproofing in the hole, do you know where it comes out? Down at the
bottom of the suspension console!

On the driver's side of the engine bay, up on the console right next to
where the tube for the lid latch cable is located, are a couple of holes,
one of which is threaded to hold something that's missing on my car. If you
spray rustproofing in those holes, guess where it comes out? The rear drain
hole of the longitudinal clam shell!

Did you know that the 2 front engine supports (the "L" shaped pieces) are
open both at the top and the bottom? Is it fun to have your motor drop on
the ground from one of these failing?

Why didn't they just spray salt water in there and get it over with
quickly! As far as I'm concerned, you might as well assume that everything
in the engine compartment is exposed to water, so  it's no wonder these
cars rust away to nothing! Sheesh!

I can understand holes at the bottom of body cavities, to allow
ventilation, but holes exposed to rain is just stupid. There are a lot of
holes, both on top and on bottom, more than I've seen on any other car.

Here's a tip, next time you're under the car (heh, like next week!), take a
small poking tool and clean out your drains. You'll be surpised at how many
there are. I keep finding new ones that I didn't know about, like the small
one that's just above where the rear trailing arms attach to the body,
between the two mounting points. There are drain holes in the stamped inner
mounting point for the trailing arms also. (one of mine was clogged with
small rocks - how did that happen?) In the arch where the rear engine tin
meets the body, there are two drain holes on the backside above the bell
housing for the transmission. In the engine bay, down on the shelf towards
the rear on each side is another drain hole. Of course, there are the holes
in the trunk cross box member to address also. These are supposed to have
plugs in them. Oh, yeah, don't forget the outer ends of this box section,
out by each wheel well, where the box section meets the pinch weld, there's
a gap in that little corner where the box meets the trunk floor - caulk it!
Talk about a vulnerable position! that little gap is exposed to wheel
spray. No wnder the trunk floors rot out!

Caulk. Caulk is good. Caulk the seams both under the car and in the engine
bay. Rustproof first though. If I can't find plugs to plug up these
rain-exposed holes, then it's time to get out the duct tape! (I wonder if I
can get duct tape in Zambezi Green??)

I haven't even taken a good look at the front of the car yet....
