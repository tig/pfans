Hi Tom!

   You asked:

   The weather finally co-operated enough so that I could do this
(although the wind is blowing the seeds off my neighbors trees at a
rate that makes it look like snow) and here are the results (NOTE: 
my car is a '74... there may be some differences! ):

   If you look straight down at the right rear light assembly, and
imagine rotating it around it's long axis so that it is upside down,
with the lens pointing into the trunk, you will see the wire
terminals on the right arranged something like this:

     ___  1     ___ 2

     ___  3     ___ 4     ___  5


  The numbering is arbitrary, assigned by me to make the transmission
of the info via E-mail easier.  The wire connections are as follows:

 1 =  two Browns  (ground)
 2 =  Black / Green  (right turn signal)
 3 =  Gray / Brown  (reverse light)
 4 =  Black / Yellow  (brake light)
 5 =  Gray / Red   (tail lights)

   Note:  when listing wire colors, the first color denotes the
insulation color, and the second color denotes the stripe, or tracer
color.

   I somehow got the idea into my head that it was only the right
side that you needed help with.  If you need more info, please let me
know, but there will probably be a delay... back to work again for at
least four days... sigh...

   I hope this helps.

					Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
