Hi Larry!

   I'm behind in my E-mail again... (so what else is new?).

   Well.... therein lies the exact problem that I am trying to solve!
  You see, both my old Mahles and my new Kolbenschmidts pass the long
feeler gauge test on the low (tight) side of specs:  I bought two of
the long feeler gauges: .002"  (.051 mm) and .004"  (.102 mm)... I
don't remember which one I used now, but I remember that they were
very tight on drag.   Even if the gauge that I used was the .004"
gauge, this is well within spec for used pistons  (I just don't
remember whether I used the same gauge for both the new and used
pistons, but I do remember that they were within spec using both the
long feeler gauge trick and measuring the bore and the piston and
doing the arithmetic.)

   The problem is, that both my used pistons and my new ones passed
the clearance measurements with flying colors, and both new and old
could be rocked back and forth in the bore to what I considered ( no
real experience here ) an alarming degree.   I don't see how it could
be otherwise, given the degree of taper that I observe.   Even the
tightest fit, if it is only over the range of a centimeter or so,
will allow a thing 7 to 10 cm in length to rock back and forth in a
cylindrical bore.

   Now we come to the crux of the matter:  Both piston sets pass the
micrometer and long feeler gauge tests easily, so the spec book says
"keep 'em".... yet you said (and I agreed with you to the tune of
$400. until I got my new pistons): "if you can actually feel the
piston rock in the bore, i'd say you have JUNK!!.. TOSS IT!  "

   Now, the issue that I'm trying to resolve is which spec is
critical, and which is not.   I can think of no way of doing this
other than gathering data on the taper of a whole bunch of pistons,
both new and used, and doing a statistical analysis.   Logic says
that if nearly all pistons are tight at the bottom and loose at the
top, and all of them (even new ones) rock back and forth in the bore,
then this is NORMAL, and don't worry about it.   On the other hand,
if most pistons do NOT have much taper, and DO NOT rock back and
forth in the bore, then excessive taper must be grounds for rejecting
the pistons as unusable, even if they are NEW.   Since I have only
one set of used ones, and one set of new ones (now installed and
unavailable for measurement) I have only two data points (8 actually,
since there are 4 pistons in a set, but you get the idea).

   Hence the request for people to mike their pistons and send me the
raw data.

   This might have been me... I was quite concerned about it at the
time, and am still somewhat concerned, although since the new pistons
look and measure the same,  I have come to think that this may indeed
be normal.

   However, I am constrained to point out that if there is this much
clearance at the top, then the piston will indeed rock back and forth
in the bore, regardless of how tight the skirt clearance is (assuming
the piston is not an interference fit, which would be a whole other
sort of problem).

  I may have made an error here, as I measured the clearance with the
piston in the bore right side up.   However, I did mike the bore in
several places from top to bottom, and as I recall, there was
practically no measureable wear; no appreciable differences in
diameter, so I assume the feeler gauge measurement would have worked
out about the same regardless.

  I can pull my old pistons and cylinders down off the shelf and
repeat the feeler gauge measurement with them, if you are interested.

   Thanks again for taking the time and trouble that you have
obviously put into your replies
