My ignition switch just started acting up on me, I suspect its an =
ignition switch. It doesn't turn off. I had to increasingly trurn the =
switch all the way left with for a few times to actually kill the =
engine, some times it'd shut down but the ignition lights remained lit =
util I further forced it left several times to actually get those off =
too. I am worried about getting stranded so will remidy this right away =
if I can.  But how?

I was reading an article that said only the 71 and earlier cars needed =
the steering column to be stripped down to get at it and 72 or newer =
simply unplug from the back. I can feel some wires in that area but =
would rather get some advise before tacking it on my own.

Does anyone know how this is done? Or do I have to take apart the =
steering column?
