Jim,
Thanks for your flattery. 
Expert? X=unknown and spert=drip =unknown drip THAT'S ME Alright :-)))))
My reply here is I repair them but anyone else can do the same. NO EXPERT.
The following is my general thoughts and theory which may be questionable.

Seriously, there is always light around the butterfly and was that way when
it left the factory. Not always like you describe. I would think that
somewhere along the way, a different butterfly plate was installed in your
TB by someone. The numbers mean nothing to me except the manufacturers part
number. Have you tried to install with numbers facing the other direction to
see how throat and butterfly plate mate? Is it the same or worse?

The butterfly plate has a 1 degree taper around the edge. It was sheared
with the flat brass plate set at 1 degree so as to mell with the circular
throat in fully closed throttle position. There are straight sections on the
edge also which fit precisely into the flat area of the throttle shaft.
Generally I find most numbers on butterfly facing opposite direction of the
idle air adjustment screw, the screw with the spring that is normally frozen
by neglect.   
 
Check your throttle body and you will see that there is some lateral motion.
<- -> on the throttle shaft but not really a problem unless the nut is loose
on the shaft itself.
 
The hole in the butterfly is for vacuum venting of the suction that
developes down in the throat and without some venting the vaccuum would be
very difficult to overcome and I suppose would contribute to excess fuel
flooding the compression chambers, since closed is the choke position. Some
actually solder these holes closed. ????

The swinging rotational motion of the butterfly on the throttle shaft is for
intake AIR that rushes down into the throat, mixes with the fuel drawn into
the throat by the rush of air and atomized into properly proportions for the
required combination needed for proper combustion in the compression chamber
which some use one word to describe all I said as metering.

The 914 was supplied with 2 different types of throttle bodies. The one you
have is the one everyone would like to have. The early models had 2 vaccumm
ports on it. I won't go into this reasoning since all I did was repair them
when someone sent them to me, but pollution reduction was a factor in later
years.

Hope this answers your questions.
 
Actually, the purpose of my previous post was to enlighten others as to how
I did it. I am NOT doing them any longer as the cost of the equipment is
more than I care to invest, since support of this list members roster failed
me earlier even though I was doing the work free except for the cost of
material and partial cost recovery of machinery needed. I don't do the Drill
Press method except for dire owners. My work quality has to satisy me. I am
more critical of what I do than anyone else. If I please myself, it is a
guarantee others will be pleased.
 
I lost much money with this hobby. I sold all of my equipment when I was
close to losing my home and all I possessed due to a forced loss of job and
into early retirement and my savings were expended. Even in the last
submission to the list, I have had a total of 3 inquiries for a total of 7
TB's promised. With this, I say, NO WAY HOSEA. 

Of course the List can buy me ALL the machines and ALL supplies I need and I
will be the List's OWN personal machinist for whatever their needs can
conjour (if I can comprehend clearly) and local zoning permits, providing
all machinery and tools become my permanent property after one year of
providing free skill and labor. Companies or individuals for profit
Prohibited. Shipping will be borne by individuals requiring my service, both
directions. One man operation requires time so let that be your guiding
factor. Full or partial restorations are for others to do. Not me.
Machinists make new parts and repair old parts. I would still have a tax
liability as tax laws state that even if done as a hobby, even for non
profit, the VALUE of the machinery has a tangiable VALUE and therefore taxes
must be paid on the full amount of this VALUE as earned income.

April Fool. Got you since this was written earlier on April 1 and mailed now..


Best regards to a good member, whose knowledge has always been appreciated.

Mike
