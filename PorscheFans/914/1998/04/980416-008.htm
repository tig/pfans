Haven't done it but seen it done.  George Wright, a machinist who has done
some 914 stuff (does the BMW machining and had a kit to replace the prop.
valve with an adjustable) had done it to one of his cars and showed me.  He
said he bought two of them that were the length he wanted for the amount of
trunk opening. They had a bracket on one side and he made a bracket from
angle iron for the other.  He used the pop rivet like threaded inserts to
mount them.  Seemed nice.

I recall seeing something where a company had or was going to have a kit to
do this.  Pelican? Automotion?  Don't recall.

Subject:  Rear trunk lid...




Good day!!
Just a quickie about the rear deck lid of my 74. The PO had removed the
springs from the rear deck lid so now I have to use a 2x4 to hold it open.
Anyone ever try to put a pair of those pneumatic doo ma hickies in as
replacement? If so what size or how do I measure for the right fit?
Thanks In advance!!
