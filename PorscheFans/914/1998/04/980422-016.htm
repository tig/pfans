O.K. - I really didn't want to jump into this one since I'm tired of
seeing posts like 'where are the other 600 members?', but I guess I
will.....

Lets look at the situation.  If 600 members did get dropped from the
list, what would happen?  Most of these people would probably notice
within a few days and re-subscribe.  If this happened, the list
membership would have climbed back up fairly quickly within a few days
(this did not happen).

So maybe these 600 or so people were dropped, and tried to re-subscribe
within a few days, but couldn't or were rejected. The listmaster would
have then been flooded with questions/complaints about not being able
to subscribe, get their digest etc.  From the posts, it seems pretty
obvious that the listmaster did not get a whole bunch of
questions/complaints.

So I think we can all assume that there is just a bug in the software
and that all 6XX members are all still there happily reading their
Porschefans.
