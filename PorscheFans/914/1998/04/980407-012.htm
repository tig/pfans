Never tried the Synchometer, is that the one with what looks like a cone on
the end? Sits down into the velocity stack?

I had a Unisyn for my VW with dual carbs but never liked it, had a hard
time with balancing.  I did the 4-tube barometer thing.  Put a small tube
into the intake manifolds, one under each carb base and used the 4 tube
mercury model that JCWhitney sells.  Seemed to work fairly well, I could
balance them easir.  Now if I ever finish messing with the 914 and get back
to the Thing with the O2 sensor I need to play with the jetting.  Or switch
it to FI ;-)

Sources?  Prices?  Why do you need two (at least in the case of the Unisyn,
somebody has to hold the thing on so you're either running back and forth
from one
side of the engine to the other or you need a 2nd person)?
Also, has anyone used a 4-tube barometer like those used in synching
motorcycle
carbs?   That looks like the best approach as long as you're willing to
plumb your
intakes for connections to the meters.  Since it has four separate tubes
right
next to each other, you see the synchronization in real time.  I haven't
spent the
$40-50, but I've been tempted.
