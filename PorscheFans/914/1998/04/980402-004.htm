Everybody seems to have contradictory info, but actually most of you
have just part of the right info.

The Djet was an evolving entity, just like so many other parts of the
car.  Some of the ECU do shut off the fuel during decel.  IIRC, it is
the '72 and earlier.  At least some of the later ones do not.  You would
be astonished to see the internal differences between a '73 unit and a
'76 unit.  The '76 has a whole 'nuther circuit board packed with nifty
little parts.  

As for the decel valve, I have removed them in the past, but have
re-installed them. They do good things.  Just be sure you get the hoses
hooked up correctly, and not logically, as it will do funny things. 
RTFM.  

The decel valve is typical of the trashy way this system is built.  The
decel valve should have been mounted directly on or in the manifold box,
eliminating three hoses.  Same goes for most of the rest of the parts.
Djet could have been a really sanitary installation if it had been built
by anybody other than the idiots who designed those stupid fuses.
