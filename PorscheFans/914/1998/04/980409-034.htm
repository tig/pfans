Thanks for the reply, Jeffrey.  Where would they be crossed?  They're "tied"
together approximately where the engine meets the tranny, but that's just to
keep them out of the way...  Even if they were, it doesn't change the fact
that with the throttle cable completely disconnected from the throttle body,
it's a real PITA to open.

Hi JJ!

Did you first check to see if you crossed the throttle and clutch cables?
I did this once, and boy is is scary when you step on the clutch and the
engine races over 8000 RPM!
