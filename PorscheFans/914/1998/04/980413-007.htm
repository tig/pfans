     Well, I got my car running good enough to go for
   a test drive Sun. One possibly big problem was the
   connector to the fuel pump wasn't seated all the way.
   I also, replaced the Pertronix with the Compufire. It
   seems there is a slight fit problem where the rotor
   doesn't quit seat all the way unless I file off some
   of the base of the rotor.    
   Now for the problem: until the engine gets good and
   warm it cuts out on me weather idling and especially
   while trying to drive. Could this be a timing problem?
   (I didn't really set the timing because I still have
    to find the marks and set it up.) Maybe I have a loose
   valve or two and they don't open far enough until warm?
   I know it's hard to figure out when I keep shortcutting
   and not going by the numbers. The next thing I will be
   doing is marking the impeller so I can find TDC. Then I
   can make sure timing is good. Can the impeller be removed
   with the engine in the car? I might take it out to mark
   it and remove the rust but it sound like it makes more
   sense to use the timing mark on the flywheel. What's
   the opinion?
 
              Thanks.
