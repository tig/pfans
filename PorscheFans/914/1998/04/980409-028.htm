What I did on my car was to place it on the drivers side over the Relay
board. I cut through the mesh (which can be easly replaced). The wiring then
goes from Bat to switch to Starter. And the Alternator killer drops down to
the connection coming out of the relay board.

	Subject:	Battery cut off

	Hi all, I am installing a Bosh battery cut off switch in my 914 GT
replica.
	Where is the best location for this? I am considering putting it
right above
	the battery on the sheet metal to the right of the engine lid. This
seems like
	a logical location, I think that PCA track events requires a battery
cut off
	accessible to track personel in case of an emergency. In photos I
have saved
	over the years, I see the switch installed on the front cowl area,
the rear
	tunk area and in the cockpit. I'm curious as to where other 914
owners would
	mount theirs. Suggestions? This is a fair weather car, so I'm not
too
	concerned about it being mounted on the car's exterior. Also, I
stripped and
	preped the front trunk area of my 914, it is in satin black primer
right now.
	I was going to paint it Gaurds red again, just like the body, but I
think the
	satin black looks cool for some reason. I notice in my work shop
manuals, some
	of the cars in the photos have black trunk and wheel well areas.
Were some 914
	delivered this way?  I'm curious, What would you do??
