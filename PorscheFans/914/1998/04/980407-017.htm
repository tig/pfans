   Well, I've got a leak at some exhaust port on mine right now. I
pulled the exhaust off in order to get at the push rod tube seals, and
have tried twice to get the heat exchangers on without a leak. I know
that it's a small leak, you can hear it at idle, but when the engine is
revved or thoroughly warmed, it seems a lot less. Does anyone know the
right torque setting for the exhaust manifold nuts? I can't seem to find
it anywhere. I started with 10 #'s and am now at 14, what's right?  At
least the seals and valve covers don't leak anymore, and my heater no
longer emits clouds of blue.
