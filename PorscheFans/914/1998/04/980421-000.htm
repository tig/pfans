  There could be another culprit, if you haven't already checked it;
the thermostat and flappers.

  Warm the engine up and verify that the flappers are fully open,
i.e. there should be just a little bit of slack in the thermostat
cable.  The spring on the flapper actuation shaft should be properly
captured and forcing the flappers to the open position; this is best
checked with the engine cold by loosening the thermostat cable clamp;
check that the flappers go to full open under spring pressure and
move freely.

   I bought a used engine that had had the flapper assembly removed. 
This is a no-no, as the flapper on the right side is used to deflect
the air stream into the oil cooler.   It is possible to remove the
thermostat, as all that will result is slow warm-up (provided the
force-open spring is good), but the flappers MUST be present for
proper cooling.

   Also check for missing sheetmetal around the bottom of the engine;
the deflectors that go above the pushrods between the cylinders are
particularly important.   Also, if your thermostat has not been
removed (some cars have had this done) then it may not reach full
expansion without the warm air deflector which is a flat plate that
bolts onto both the engine case and the heat exchanger, and obscures
the thermostat from view when installed (see fig. 3.3a on page 15 of
the Haynes book).

  Lastly, check for missing or improperly seated spark-plug grommets,
or any other un-plugged holes in the top of the engine tin that will
allow air to escape.   Don't forget to check the insulating pad that
goes on the firewall behind the seats... if it's loose, then it may
be getting sucked into the fan opening at speed.   Of course, make
sure that no part of the engine lid opening is blocked.

  One more thing:  check to see that the triangular rubber deflectors
that stick down from the fire-wall below the front of the engine bay
are not broken or missing.   These break up the airflow from under
the floor pan when the car is at speed and reduce the dynamic
pressure below the engine where the engine cooling air has to exit.

					Good Luck,
                                                            Jim T.
