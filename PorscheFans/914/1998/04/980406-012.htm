Subject: Questions

I have a few questions.

1. If looking for a SMOOTH comfortable ride, but on a SMALL budget, what
is
my best choice on shocks and cartdridge inserts and the 914 source?

A: KYB

3. Process of syncro of dual 40 webers. Is there a recommended method by
any
of the list members who have these, who do it themself? A foolproof
prodedure for an old dummy, ME?

A: Get a unisyn gage for the idle. Get the idle to show on the guage
equally on all four bores first. Then start looking very closely at how
and when the operation of the linkage begins opening the throttle on the
carbs. If they open at exactly the same time you've got the game licked
unless some leverage differences, between carbs, change the rate of
throttle opening later in the process.

5. Hanging things. Under the rear, the speedometer and clutch cable,
other
cables. These hang down on most 914's I see around here. What is the best
tie points or whatever to keep them hidden but still functioning without
binding? A direct route description needed immediately.

A: Good old plastic cable ties work great. I just tie them all together
now they don't hang down.
