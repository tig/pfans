Steve,

Golly gee, does that sound familiar.  You did forget to mention that
the car unexplainably has "good days" and "bad days".  I used to blame
it on cheap gas.  (Now all the gas in CA is cr*p, so that excuse is
gone!)

Mine would idle at 2,000 cold, 800 when mostly warm, and as low as
100 when really hot.

What fixed mine:  Rebuilding the distributor, and fixing ALL the vacuum
leaks.  And in retrospect, the distributor probably wasn't the problem;
but do check the grounding braid on the breaker plate.

How I fixed the vacuum leaks was to take the car to someone who REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY knows these cars.  In the SF Bay Area, one how does is
Rich Bontempi.  And I stood there for an hour listening to him swear at
the DPO (Dreaded Previous Owner) while swapping and exchanging hoses.

He took a "pretty good running but with bad days every now and then"
motor,
replaced 5 lbs (literally) of rotten hoses, and made it a "runs as well
as
a 1.7 could be expected to" motor.

If it were me:  I'd buy a "complete re-hose kit" from AA.  Remember,
it's
not just the price of the hoses.  When you buy the kit from them, you
get
the right to call and pester them with questions.

Gary.
