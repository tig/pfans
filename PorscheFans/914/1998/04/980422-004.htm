Hello all,



I just wanted to share my experience in with dropping a tranny last weekend.   I
don't know if this is standard procedure, but as per instructions from a friend,
I was able to drop the tranny without dropping the engine, or even removing the exhaust.
 



What I did was…

· Remove clutch and speedo cables.

· Remove wires to Starter

· Remove ground strap.

· Remove shift linkage to tranny

· I used some big zip ties to suspend the exhaust.  While I didn't have to remove
the exhaust, I did have to remove the bracket that attaches to the tranny, and supports
the exhaust.  This was so the tranny could be worked back off the engine.

· The drive axles required a little pounding with and rotating, but they came off
rather easily.



After that, it just a matter of working the tranny off the engine with a jack bit
by bit, and it came off nicely.



I checked out the chutch plate, and I could still see some "imprint" on the face
(Sachs), so I figured it's pretty new (later the PO confirmed that he just replaced
it).



The reason I'm doing all this is because I blew out first gear (on my driveway no
less!).  So I got a used tranny from a friend.



Question:  Are there any items I should check out for wear (pilot bearing?, throw
out bearing?) before putting the tranny back on?



I'm also very excited about getting a (Kirk) roll bar delivered today, and the new
Kumhos sitting in the garage (I still don't know if they are going to fit under the
fenders!).  In any case I'm going to have a busy weekend.



Sam
