Well I checked the floor pans inside the car and they look and feel solid. So
perhaps I am over reacting about the damage. I believe I can get away with
just welding in the Mayuer pieces. My question is...where do I find the Mayuer
pieces? I didn't see them in the AA catalog or the Automotion cat. Or are the
parts called something else altogether... Oh and a quick Thanks to everyone
that responded to my plea for help. It looks like at this point mismatched
wheels are the least of my problems... On the up side I have found 3 914's
locally that I may try and round up, if the wife lets me.......

Thanks In Advance

any of my attempts to order custom tags
everything I have submitted has been 
denied. Perhaps this next attempt will work:
