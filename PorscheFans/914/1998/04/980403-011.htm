Yes, this is true.  Like anything else, there's two ways to do this - 
the cheap way, and the RIGHT way.

I started out trying the cheap way.  I sent my '74 hubs to F.A.T. to 
have them drilled and re-studded.  When I got them back, I tried them in 
a wheel and they didn't seem to fit very well.  I called them up and 
they told me I had to install them back in the trailing arm and bolt the 
wheel on to really tell.  They assured me that everything would be fine.  
"We do hundreds of these and never had a problem", and "they were 
checked before we sent them",  were their "lines".

Well, thinking that they knew what they were doing, I installed them and 
tried to bolt on the wheel.  Well first of all it didn't fit right. I 
tried to torque it down and couldn't get it seated all the way.  Then, I 
couldn't get it off!  I finally yanked it off and scraped off a bunch of 
the wheel metal in the holes in the process.  I thought "Great!  Now I'm 
ruining my wheels too!".  I tried all 4 wheels (NOT tightening though) 
and it was the same on all of them.  I then made a template and matched 
it to the hubs, and the studs were OBVIOUSLY off.  I also noticed that 
they had to countersink the back side (because the hub slopes) to get a 
flat surface.  There were different depths to these "hatchet machining 
jobs", some being WAY deeper than even remotely necessary, resulting in 
not much hub thickness left for the studs to "grab" onto.  As a result, 
many of the studs was already loose and could be wiggled side to side.  
One actually fell right out.  My hubs were ruined.  I called F.A.T. 
again and told them in no uncertain terms that I was returning the hubs 
for a full refund PLUS the cost of my hubs which they ruined.  

They called me a few days later when they received them and STILL 
insisted that there was nothing wrong with them!  He even had a guy 
check them in their "test wheel" while I was on the phone, and said they 
fit perfectly!  BULLSH_T!  After a long argument, they finally agreed to 
refund my money and pay for my hubs.  I'll NEVER deal with them again!

I finally decided to do it the Right way.  I contacted Otto's, who got 
me a set of '70 hubs, drilled and re-studded them.  They fit PERFECTLY!  
Wheels go on and off easily.  No need for them to remove material from 
the back to flatten a spot for the stud heads.  The flat spots are 
already there, and thicker as well.

Do yourself a favor and do it the proper way.  Yes, it's much more 
expensive, but save the "hack" jobs for the Yugo.

P.S.  Not to mention what a Pain in the As_ it is to get the hubs out of 
the trailing arms - which I had to do twice!
