Dave,

     There are a few alternative ways to get TDC for your car without 
removing anything!  One, the impeller fans are already notched for this, 
and two, there is a mark on the top of the flywheel that you can check too. 
 Take a look at our new article, "914 Valve Adjustment Made Easy," and you 
will see what I'm talking about.

Also, finding TDC won't really help too much with the timing?

Hope this helps,

Wayne
