Well, it really does depend on your suspension setup. I had a relatively
stock setup, stock torsion bars, 19mm sway bar and 150# in the rear, and
I found that I wanted the car fairly low. I put in a new and decidedly
stiffer suspension, 21mm torsion bars, 22mm sway bar, and 200# coils,
and found that car handled better at a slightly higher ride height.
That, and the lower you go the more bump steer you'll find. Seeing as
how I'm not allowed to move the steering rack in the class I compete in,
the bump steer was something I either lived with or raise the car. 

As for 'consensus'? I don't think there raelly is one. Low is good, but
it does induce bump steer and broken front spoilers. Too low though, and
you run into suspension geometry changes, and bottoming out shocks and
things like that.

YMMV of course.
