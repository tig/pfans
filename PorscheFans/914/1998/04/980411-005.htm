Hello all,



I had the unfortunate experience yesterday of having my transmission blow up.  I
was going up a steep hill in first gear, and was being a little too enthusiastic,
I guess, when something went "pop".  I lost power to the wheels and rolled back down
the hill.  After coming to my senses, I realized that First and Reverse were gone,
but the other gears were still there.



After looking at the Hayes manual, I would guess that it's the first/reverse shifting
fork.



Could anyone give me some advice about what may have happened, and what kind of nightmare
is involved with fixing it.  Would it be better to ditch the tranny and look for
a "sideshifter", or attempt to replace the broken parts.



Thanks

Sam
