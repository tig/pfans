The HI-6 is not "listening in" on the tach wire and drawing off signal.  
On the contrary, if wired correctly, there should be a small gauge green 
wire FROM the HI-6 that SUPPLIES signal to the tach.  Also, you must wire 
the blue wire (cylinder select wire) into the red (ignition hot) in order 
to tell the HI-6 computer that you have a 4 cylinder (if you have 
something else, like a 6, follow the instructions).  My tach has been 
slightly BETTER since installing the HI-6.  The CB setup could be causing 
you problems, I have no experience.  Crane may be a good resource as they 
do make tach/fuel injection adapters for special applications, see the 
instructions p. 14.  As for #2, you should not need this, but the 
manufacturers of these probably have dealt with this problem - my timing 
light seems normal.
