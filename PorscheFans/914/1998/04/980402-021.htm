	I don't know what gauges are best.  I have (OK, had) an aftermarket
VDO oil pressure gauge in my car.  It requires one extra wire to be run from
the engine compartment to the cockpit.  I pushed the wire through the hole
in the firewall that the main harness goes through.  If I had to do it over,
I'd actually put the wire inside the rubber boot for the main harness, like
we did with Josh2's car.  (Yup, Josh, I remember them!)
	Mounting the sender is a pain.  The sender is much larger than the
stock one, so an "adaptor kit" is required.  The kit consits of a bracket
that goes around the sender, and a hose with NPT fittings on the ends.  One
end goes on the sender, the other end goes in the crankcase.  I put the
bracket on the fan shroud, using one of those convenient little 6mm holes
that are evidently there for the airconditioner or some such.  But I could
never get the hose to seal to the case adequately.  I just could not get a
wrench on the flats at the end to tighten it up, since it is waaaay down under
the sheetmetal.  It always leaked.
	I used some brass plumbing-type pipe to make an adaptor for my
adaptor.  That way I could screw the pipe in using the top end of the pipe.
But that was pretty inelegant, and got in the way of setting the timing.
	I did eventually fix the problem.  I think I removed the distributor
and maybe the manifold for better access.  Then I used my needle-nose vise
grips to grab the flats at the end of the hose and screw it in, a little tiny
bit at a time.  It took a long time and was not much fun.

	VDO oil temp gauges should be easier.  You can find a sump plate (the
one at the driver's side front corner of the engine) from a car that origi-
nally had the temp gauge.  If yours already does, that one works.  You'll
need to buy the sender and gauge together, so that they match.  Unfortunately,
nobody really knows the calibration for the stock 914 sensors.   8^(  Use the
existing wire for the signal, and hook up your new gauge where the old one was.
	The aftermarket VDO gauges are smaller than the holes in the stock
center console, so you need an "adpator ring".  I think it looks a little bit
cheesy, especially if you have both stock and aftermarket gauges installed.
	Jim T. has a couple of gauges in an under-dash holder.  I thought that
setup looked pretty good.

	More at a later date, as the "gauge project" keeps evolving.
