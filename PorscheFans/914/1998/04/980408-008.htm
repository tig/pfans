There are different kinds of ticking noises, so the other posts yesterday 
may be right on.  I have a regular ticking noise that comes from the 
aftermarket coil.  It is loud because of where I have it mounted.  They 
all make some noise but the hotter ones are louder.  They will seem to be 
louder at some times than others.  Also, if you have a loose coil or plug 
wire, that will make the same noise.
