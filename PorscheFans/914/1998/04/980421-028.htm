	I speculate that it was a lot cheaper for VW/Porsche to just use
the same distributor vaccuum module (or "dashpot") on all these cars, even
when they weren't supposed to have vaccuum advance.  They didn't have to
find or pay for a run of non-advance dashpots that way.  (Note that the
dashpot has a Type III part number.)  However, the  ports (or fittings) on
the throttle body are added on after the TB is cast, which is a step that
can be eliminated without costing extra money.

>What is the advantage of dual ports?

	Much of this info comes from a post by RD Rick a few years ago, in
which he explains a whole lot about the vaccuum-actuated stuff on the car.
Any errors in here are mine, though, not his.  (You can probably do a search
on the new PFans Archives Search Engine--surf around in <www.kimble.com>,
I think.)
	One port, the one that seems to be hooked up in all 914s, is the
vaccuum retard port.  At idle, it sees a pretty high vaccuum, and pulls
the timing back away from "advanced".  I may also have some effect on an
overrun condition (high RPMs, throttle closed).  In theory, this keeps the
idle nice and low and low-polluting, without sacrificing some zip when
starting off the line (from idle).
	The vaccuum advance port on the throttle body will "see" a very
high vaccuum at a very small throttle setting.  This is due to the end of
the butterfly plate being very close to the inner end of the port at that
throttle setting.  All the air going into the motor is rushing past that
small aperture, very quickly.  Due to the Bernoulli effect, this creates
a low-pressure area right there, that the vaccum port taps.  This vaccuum
moves the points plate in the distributor in the "advance" direction.  I
have heard that it improves off-the-line power, and I have also heard that
it does nothing for power and is only for emissions controls because it
helps the car burn gasoline more efficiently at low throttle settings.
	But then, supposedly it was removed from 74 914s (and maybe later?)
for emissions reasons, so...

>Can they be used on ALL 914 models that are fuel injected?

	Almost certainly.  All 914s seem to have come with the distributor
dashpot (vaccuum thingy) that has fittings for both advance and retard.  If
you can find the proper vaccuum to feed both of those, you'll get them both.
Effects (of adding vacc advance) are said to range from nothing up to a
noticeable improvement at low RPMs.
	If your carbs have the correct fittings on them, you can use them on
a carbed motor, too.
