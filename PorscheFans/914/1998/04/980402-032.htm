John,
My old book says , "In the ignition distributor, the contacts determine when
fuel is to be injected. Two sets of contacts, offset by 180 degrees at the
lower end of the ignition distributor, are actuated by an additional cam.
The position of the cam and the position of the contacts in relation to the
cam shaft position are set so that the start of the fuel injection is timed
with the opening of the intake valves.
Since both contacts are accutated by a single cam, the time span between the
opening of the first and opening of the second contact is a measure of
engine speed. The contacts also serve the speed dependant control of the
basic fuel quanity."

In other words check the trigger points in the lower part of the distributor
and see if that is why you are getting no fuel at the injectors. Sound like
you are pretty flustered. You can do it if anybody can.
