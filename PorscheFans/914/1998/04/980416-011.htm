	Your timing is probably too advanced.  The left mark
is most likely the dynaimc timing mark.  Static timing is (if
I remember correctly) about 5 degrees BTDC.  The dynamic (at
3500 RPM, vacc hoses disconnected) timing is 27 degrees BTDC.
The correct dynamic timing mark on a 1.7 or 2.0 is very close
to a fan blade that is just next to one of the four "blocks"
in the fan.  I think it's one blade to the right of a block.
	Fairly few 914 fans have a static timing mark, but
almost all have both TDC and dynamic timing marks.  BTW, the
TDC mark is usually a "0" stamped in the fan, while the timing
mark is a notch.

	Possibly at idle, but chances aren't that great.  The
area where you can see the TDC mark is very small, so if it's
off even a little bit, you won't see it.
	I use the stroboscopic light at 3500 RPM.  It's the
easiest way for me to set the timing.  I have also painted the
top of the fan blade near the 27 BTDC mark red.  That way I
don't need a mirror to see when I'm close on the timing.
