Jon, I checked my bolts last night and they have not stretched. The threads
are as good as new. The bolts would stretch in the threaded portion if they
stretch at all, since that is the weakest part. Have you actually seen these
bolts stretched?

I went ahead and processed them to make them like new again. I removed the
rust with naval jelly and a wire brush, rinsed them, then put them in the
cold blackening chemical I got from Caswell, then after blackening I put
them in the sealer solution for a while then let them dry. They look like
new black bolts now.
