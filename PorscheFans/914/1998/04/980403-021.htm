William,

Don't bother trying.  (I had 3 914's when my son was born.....)

Any seat that's large enough to protect the child is too large to
fit in the center position.  It may be too large even for the
passenger seat.

In about another year and a half, he/she will be large enough to
use a "seat booster" (or kangaroo seat), which works well in a 914.

Gary.
