Mike, List Member, ALL. 
Regarding FIX-ME-NOW mail.

As a member of this List, I thought that I would make it cost effective to
ALL on the List. If the List would like to decide what is GOOD for ALL price
wise, I will study their opinion. This service that I do will NEVER make me
money. 
Let me expand on "NEVER make me money". I could go to one of the burger
joints and make more per hour, work harder than anyone there, and get some
benefits.  The TB work will gross for me a definately lower hourly rate and
much harder work.  Any of you working for burger team wages?
I put it to an open opinion for all to set the price. If the price decided
by opinion of ALL is fair to me, I'll let you know. Set a reasonable time
limit. I still need 60 TB to start this up again and will do them in the
order of the posting date to the List with subject line FIX-ME-NOW. If you
tell me in any other manner, like including in another message, repost with
FIX-ME-NOW subject.
 
There is some satisfaction to me that I can help others as others on this
list have helped me. My OWN PERSONAL FINANCES changed to near pauper level
last year. I had to sell my machines I was doing the original TB Service to
keep from losing our home. We will get make it. Always have. Always will.
The things I want from this list is friendship, advice and THROTTLE BODYS to
bush.:-))

This message and any other message that I send to the list or to those by
private mail, in no form or fashion, should be construted that I am poor
mouthing myself. That is not my intent NOW or EVER. 
I just state the facts in the open book manner as something that happened to
me. I have very little about my life that I keep hidden from anyone. There
is ONE major exception. What that is, is my own personal secret. It's NOT a
sexual thing, if some of you might be thinking that. At age 62, I am
hopefully still considering myself as a stud. Sorry ladies, I really joke a
lot. Life should have an ample amount of humor in the mix of daily life.
That is how you survive.
Make a good president, huh?

About my personal ranting. Just want my friends, ALL of you, to know what
makes me tick. My friends are here, in this 914 world.

Take a poll, among yourselves, and set a fair price for ALL and let me know
by majority in a single message. Do it privately and surprise me. ALL of you
who need the TB bushing. Some have sent requests but no offer. I cannot do
it free. Thousands of 914 were manufactured. Surely more need TB work than
what I have seen in the last couple of weeks. 

Echos. ALL mail FROM the list is now in triple mode here on my screen. I
have but one thing to say ...HHHEEEELLLPPPP... and yes, and yes, and yes, I
did virus scan scan scan...
