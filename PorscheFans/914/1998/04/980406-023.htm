   Steve, Unless you believe that you're making more than 275 -300 HP, I
believe that I would go with another 901. I think that you just reached
the end of the life on this box a little sooner becasue of the big
motor, but Hell, my son crunched his 901 at 100K miles with only a 1.7.
His speedometer drive gear backed out, and drilled a hole in the rear of
the case.  Contact Brad Mayeur, mentioned here recently for his
longitudinal replacement parts, becasue his speciality is really 901
gearboxes. I have heard of a mod for high horsepower 901's that includes
an oil cooler and recirc pump that adds a spray bar inside the tranny to
lube the gears and the ring and pinion. This is neccessary becasue the
tranny is reversed from it's designed role at the back of an early 911.
                                                                  good
luck, Jim S.
PS Brad will rebuild, or exchange your tranny for a lot less than $1500,
and he is the expert.
