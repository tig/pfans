John,
Thanks. The echo was not as before, 3 days ago, but now that I check the
content, what you say is exactly what is happening.
 
Porschefans List server is resending immediately, as I send. Earlier it
waited until I checked for new messages, before sending echo of my mail,
saying My message has been sent to All members.

It did not really bother me on my end, but thought it could be annoying to
other LIST MEMBERS at their end if it was echoing in their LIST mail as
Duplicate. Guess I am the only one seeing it Echoing. :-)))

Thanks again for your help. It is ALWAYS appreciated.
Your double visioned 914 friend, who worrys too much.

Mike
