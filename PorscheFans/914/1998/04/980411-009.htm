I crawled under the car today with my torque wrench set to 15 ft-lbs,
determined to find the source of my exhaust leak.  Six of the nuts were a
ft-lb or two loose, and two of them had pulled.  They were just dangling
from the heat exchangers, suspended by their double TimeSerts.  For those of
you that didn't know, past problems with my exhaust resulted in every
exhaust stud being double TimeSerted (a TimeSert in a TimeSert).  I tighted
the heat exchangers as best as I could, and when I started the car, there
was no more ticking from the valves.  After a spirted drive (with the top
off - first time this year!), I returned to the garage to discover that the
ticking was back, so there's probably more that two pulled studs now.  Since
the studs were double TimeSerted, I know there's not enough metal left to
attempt a triple TimeSert.  So here's the big question:

Is there any way to fix this without pulling the motor and shipping the
heads off to have the gaping holes filled up so new studs can be tapped?
(Please say yes...)

Thanks again,
