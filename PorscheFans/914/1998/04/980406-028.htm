After cleaning the Aux. air valve, sealing everything, setting throttle =
body, replacing accellerator cable, I have a sticking 1400 RPM after the =
car is fully warmed, a quick jolt on the gas slowly brings the revs =
down, or even throwing it into gear while stopped to slightly lug the =
engine brings down the revs.

I have a "Lumination" electronic ignition there but the wire to the =
brain that usually connects to the points is disconnected, I suspect =
rightfull so but don't know. The revs also come down too slow at =
2,000RPM and below. Assuming wiring and vacuum leaks are fine, what else =
could be the problem? Its almost as  if the distributor's damper is not =
working properly but this has been replaced with a new one. I hope the =
electronic ignition is OK for this car, I am tempted to try points to =
see if the prob is still there.

If anyone has any suggestions of where to look, they would be greatly =
appreciated. This is a brand new factory rebuilt engine I am trying to =
get to run right.
