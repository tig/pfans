List,
I want to recommend to all of you to download a zip file. It is zipped up
from the old PORSCHEFILES list that has some very good 914 info.
Not only is it good, it is catalogued by subject.
I just sampled it and it's good.

Travis Neff-Hoehne has it at his ftp site. It is there because of the
efforts of an unknown to me list member. Lets all show him his efforts were
not wasted by downloading the file.

Using your Internet browser, Just type ftp://ftp.ch2m.com/pub/914.zip and
you get it. The file size is 2156 KB so if like me with a 33.6 modem, about
10 minutes of download time.

Get it! You will be glad you did.
Thanks Stan for the old PORSCHEFILES 
Thanks to all the 914 owners who contributed the good info,
Thanks UNKNOWN TO ME list member,
Thanks Travis for the ftp site. 

Mike Cooley
