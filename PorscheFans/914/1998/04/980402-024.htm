     Hi William,
     
        A friend of mine has a 914 and used to haul around his whole
     family in the 70's (wife and two small kids).  While it wasn't exactly 
     steeped in safety, he was able to cope with the lack of side to side
     space since he (and family members) are small framed people.  The 914
     has no center seatbelts, however you could put a lap belt in place bu 
     using the existing mount hole for the driver and passenger.  My son's
     baby seat (mounted rear facing forward) is a Monster in size. We have 
     trouble fitting it into the rear seat of the Volvo Wagon (front 
     passenger seat has to be pushed up so only short legged individuals 
     can use front seat), and it is so wide, that only one person can sit 
     comfortably in the back seat next to him without being squashed.  
     While my wagon is longer than the 914, it is definitely not narrower.
     Unless you are a small man, I believe you would have a very 
     uncomfortable ride with baby in the center in the 914.  Reaching the 
     shifter would also be very interesting.  I have at most had my wife 
     and Mule-sized 95 pound dog in the car (he was on the floor on 
     passenger side) and even then, reaching the shifter was a pain 'cause 
     the dog keeps nudging my hand to tell me it is time to pet him.
     
     I pine for the days when the baby was still fitting in the tiny sub-20 
     pound babyseat, those will fit anywhere.
     
     Good Luck
     Brian
