Well, now that I've got almost 800 miles on the new top end, a fresh valve
adjustment, and a new oil change, I've dubbed the engine "ready".  I've
taken it up to redline a couple of times, and boy, what a blast!  Everything
was great until yesterday, when right as the engine climbed to 5000 rpm, it
suddenly became very loud and began to backfire.  A quick inspection of the
engine compartment revealed that the air injection "rail" had burst open.
I've pulled it off and capped the air injectors, so everything is back to
normal again.  I do, however, need a new air injection rail.  I'm not in a
big hurry (my next required emissions test isn't until 2/99), but if
anybody's got a spare (or will have a spare in the next few months), I'd
love to take it off of your hands!

Thanks again,

J.J. Slowik
