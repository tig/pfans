I should have mentioned that the car is equipped with FI, not carbs.
Several people suggested that I've got debris of some sort rolling around in
the tank plugging the hole.  Is there anyway to determine this easily?  I've
never had to do anything with my gas tank before, but from what I've read,
pulling it out is no day at the park...  I know I've got one loose spark
plug wire, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that as soon as it stops
snowing (again!) I'll be able to tighten that up and have the problem go
away.  I'll also check the rest of my connections to make sure that one of
them isn't coming loose.  I'll keep you posted, and if there's anything else
I can check, please drop me a line.

Thanks again!

J.J. Slowik
