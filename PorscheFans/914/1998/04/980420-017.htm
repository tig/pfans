	I unfortunately have had similar concerns.  I installed a sump
temperature gauge and have
used 245dF as my personal red line for lack of any other information (It
is max in the cessna and
piper handbooks I have, the only other aircooled I 'drive').
	I too live in virginia and make regular 6 hour trips to pittsburgh.  I
even went to
Albany once and came back through the city and had possibly phantom
engine problems and prayed
I at least got to Newark before it blew up.  This was in the days before
oil temperature indication.
Since I have it, I noticed I get to 245 cruising at 77 or so.  If I drop
to 65 or so, it drops below
245.
	Last year when I changed out a head on the car,  I took the oppertunity
to clean out the
muck in top of the oil cooler. I expect it was 50% clogged.   I also
replaced the fan with one that
ha all of the blades.  (the old one was missing 4 due to a coil
incident).  Guess what.  NO CHANGE.
I couldn't believe it.  I'm beginning to think that normal operating
temperature is just higher.
I even messed with different oil grades because the cooler bypass is
dependent on pressure not temperature.
NO CHANGE.  About the only thing I have heard mentioned that actually
lowers oil temperature is a remote
cooler.  I don't want to go that far.  I have been thinking about
replacing the spring/piston in the 
regulator, but that is only a guess.
