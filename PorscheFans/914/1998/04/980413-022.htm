Jon,

All i did was 'tweek' the hard lines a little by carefully bending them
together to match the T valve.  The valve itself is only about 1"x1" so I
had to pull the lines in closer.  The main supply valve coming out of the
firewall needed the most bending.  The safest way to do it would be to use
a small pipe bender, but if you're careful, you shouldn't need it.  Just
use a large area of pressure on the liones so you don't kink the metal.
The valve itself has a small hole running through the top to mount to the
firewall.  It won't line up with the old holes, so I put the bolts back in
those.  Currently, the valve is just sort of suspended there by the three
lines, and believe me, isn't going anywhere.  But I am in the process of
trying to come up with a nice aluminum spacer to put in between the valve
and firewall, probably about an 1" or so.  I'll most likely use the
existing holes for that mount.

Hope this helps.  What else have you replaced in the brake system?  I did a
little more extensive testing tonight on just how good these new brakes
are...I brused my shoulder on my 4 point harness because I didn't have it
cynched up tight enough!  These brakes are amazing!

Good luck,
