OK, I know you people all think I'm totally nuts (well at least Dave
Darling does!), but, um, I think I'm gonna nickel plate my back brakes (and
maybe the engine cylinders too). OK, calm down a minute, let me explain.

There's a serious limitation with electroplating, which is the faraday cage
effect. On highly convoluted surfaces, electroplating will build up on the
high spots and maybe not even get to the low ones. With the brake calipers
down to mere chunks of metal, there are a helluva lot of convolutions if
you ask me. The same goes for them fins on the cylinders. What to do?

Well, Caswell Plating has an "electroless nickel" plating kit that will
deposit pure nickel metal on any shaped part you can come up with. No
electricity required. They only have it in nickel though, not zinc or
something else. Nickel is really good at corrosion resistance, so it outa
work, I'm just concerned about all those Porsche people rolling thier eyes
when they see these shiny-ass brakes back there!

Sheesh, am I nuts or what?

4 litre kit: 155$
12 litre kit: 255$

PS: I haven't decided on the cylinders yet. Nickel doesn't conduct heat as
well (or does it? where's my periodic chart?) as cast iron, so maybe it's
not a good idea for engine cylinders. To be continued....
