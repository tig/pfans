Hmm.  My '72 911T regularly sees 260-270 F on the track and has for a
couple years now.  The leakdown figures have stayed mostly constant, and
the oil pressure looks fine.  I do change the oil for every event, but 
that's mostly because the MFI is so tired that it's always quite rich.
Since most of my leakage is through the rings, the oil is getting
polluted fairly quickly and needs the extra attention.  Also, the red
mark on my oil temp gauge is 270F, and I have not done anything to insure
that the calibration is correct.
