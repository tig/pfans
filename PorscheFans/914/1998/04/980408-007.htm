I just got my Kerry Hunter header back from High Performance Coatings.
IT IS BEAUTIFUL!

For a $175 dollars plus shipping, they coated the header pipes, the
collector, and the SuperTrapp housing and steel baffle that goes inside
the supertrapp.  It was delayed two weeks past quoted ship date, but
since my last race got rained out, no harm, no foul.  

The coating is nice because when I got the header/supertrapp from Kerry
Hunter, the paint was already scratched from shipping, so rust was just
a carwash away.  Now, with the HPC coating, it looks like very high tech
with a stainless steel type finish.  As a matter of reference, I checked
with Jet Hot and they were a litte more expensive.  I assume that their
work would be comparable.

I now have two works of art on my car, my front sway bar (a "Charlie
Bar") and my header.  Both pieces are so pretty, it seems a shame to put
them in anything less than a fully prepped undercarriage.  Do they make
my car go faster?  Probably marginally, but they look great. 

The only thing I can't figure out is why VW headers are $100 or 914 headers
are $450+.

Usual disclaimers; no financial incentives from any of the above
mentioned firms, your results may vary, etc...
