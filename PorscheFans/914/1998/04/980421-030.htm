Mike et al,
Didn't get your message regarding Kent AutoX until today (tuesday).
Please post me regarding your next outing--I really do wish to see one. 
As far as my Weber problems go: Friday after work I pulled some plugs to
see where I was at. Somehow, during the process I pulled a wire from the
Hella Relay to the fuel pump and after I got the plugs cleaned, the car
wouldn't start! It took me all weekend to figure out it was the fuel
pump. Doh! I pulled of the K&N's and noticed that the left carb was still
squirting even though the right was not. So I pulled the right
(passenger) side carb and took it all apart and checked the accel pump
and blew air thru all the jets, then cleaned and reinstalled it. Still no
squirt! Then I figured it had to be the fuel pump. Of course, by that
time I had drained the battery with the stereo and all the cranking
attempts, so I put the battery on the charger Sunday Night. When I got
the  car going again on Monday, it still sputtered and backfired and
sneezed and chitty chitty bang banged like before. I drove up to Bow -Wow
and got some new jets:
55 Idles (were 50)
125 Mains (were 115). 
I left the F11's and 28 mm Venturis in there (cost reduction) in there.
After some tweaking and test driving, I've got it running OK--not great.
Higher RPM's (+3500) seem good and strong (probably a little lean?), but
down low (partial throttle) it does hesitate a bit. If I open the idle
mixture screws anymore (1/2 turn), the car backfires. I did bump the
timing up a little--maybe  I should put it back? A guy at the Beetles
reunion at Marymore Park on Saturday told me his weber 40's had F7's and
this would richen low end. He had a Type I 1776cc--probably pretty
similar to my 1.8

Any advice helpful.
Nick
