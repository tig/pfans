Hi Kyle!

 I have this piece of advice from Dan Friedman in my files:

          "  Can Not say this too often ! 

          Rimco in CA is a VW based machine shop that will swap your
heads 
at a rebuild price of $75 each. There work is good, they are not a
flow 
bench house, they just rebuild type 1-IV stuff an they do a good job,
this is a production house not your standard machine shop. Get a copy
of 
HOT-VW and call them.  "

 From what I have seen and heard about MSHP, I would be reluctant to
send my heads to them.  I have been gathering a list of comments from
people on the list, and they add up to a less than optimum picture. 
If you like, I'll send you my file, but I'd think that someplace else
would be my first choice.

  You also asked:

> FAT does this too, but I've lost their numbers.
> Anybody have FAT's number?

 From my files, courtesy Andrew Warren:

FAT Performance:  714 637-2889.
