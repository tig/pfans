Greetings, 914-er's!

  Therewere so many postings on the Temp Sensor II subject that I
don't feel that it's economic to send copies to everybody, so I'll
just post to the list... everybody gets duplicates the other way
anyhow (unless in digest mode), but I digress...

 First, Josh Hadler wrote: " I also don't know where this 122F number
comes from, but that's just plain -cold- for a head temperature. "

  I agree, but I don't think that it was meant to be an operating
temperature... I interpret it to mean that if you live in Death
Valley, you can still work on your car in the summertime.

  J.J.Slowik and Dave Darling bring up an interesting point regarding
measurement of the Temp Sensor II value underway.  However, I must
point out that it is not so much the meter's interfering with the ECU
that is a problem (although that may very well occur), but the ECU
sends a current through the sensor in order to determine it's
resistance, and that current will almost certainly prevent the meter
from reading accurately.  
  There are two solutions: 1.  Simply install a switch to enable
either the ECU or the meter to "see" the sensor as desired.  It would
be possible to use the same switch to simultaneously present a fixed
resistor of appropriate value to the ECU and thus allow the engine to
continue to run.   2.  Build a costly, complicated multiplexer
circuit to switch between the two functions at a high rate.  A
capacitor should sub for the temp sensor, and a sample-and-hold
circuit could feed the ohmmeter.   If anyone wants to build the
latter, go ahead, but include me out.

   Dave Trammell suggested measurng the IR drop across a small series
resistor.  This could work, but it does depend somewhat on how the
internal circuitry of the ECU is arranged.   The TempSensor II
probably forms part of a biasing network in the base circuit of a
transistor inside the unit, but there may be other thermistors
present to subtract out the junction potential change of the
transistor with changes in temperature of the ECU, or other tricks
that might make the measurement non-straightforward.   One would have
to run calibration curves to be sure, and then we are back to one of
the brute force methods.

  Josh Hadler also wrote:  "   Hmm, so is the system designed to be
at zero resistance when the heads are at optimal temp? Or is it
designed for warmup efficiency, and hot heads were not given too much
consideration? I'm just tossing this question out there to generate
discussion, I'd like to find this out...  "

  I would too, and I suspect that the answer can be found by scoping
the injector pulses and measuring their length vs. CHT.   If they
bottom out somewhere, and get no shorter with increasing temperature
(decreasing resistance) then there is a safety rail built in.  If
not, then the addition of a fixed resistor becomes a practical
necessity.   It might be necessary to make the measurements on a
chassis dyno though, as idle conditions are probably not
representative.

   There... that's a lot more than the $.02 I'm entitled to throw out
there...
