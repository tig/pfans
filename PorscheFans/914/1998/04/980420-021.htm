That is very reasurring, but not something most cars can accomplish. The
sewer pipe going through the passenger compartment is a big deterent,
and would very very illegal in my class. I easilly see 350F CHT, I havnt
run a trials event yet with my newly installed sensors, but I do have an
event on the 2nd, so we'll see then.

Which electric fan? The ones I've seen don't seem to put out enough air,
and wile those fan kits might be great for a street/autox car. I really
can't see them being sufficient for an EP car.

Well again, not something to do on the cheap. But then again, when
you're only running a stock motor, 10 hr. rebuilds probably are not
really neccessary. But I can totally see it being important for an EP
motor. What is your motor putting out? About 160HP?

AWSOME! I think the inclusion of the RX-7 would make EP a tough class.
I'm not familiar with Savanah, but I would imagine it's more of a
handling track. Because an RX-7 is probably capable of 250+HP under EP
rules, it's that live axle in the rear that would be a big problem for
them in the twisties.
 
Congratulations!
