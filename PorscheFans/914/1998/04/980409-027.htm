Hi all, I am installing a Bosh battery cut off switch in my 914 GT replica.
Where is the best location for this? I am considering putting it right above
the battery on the sheet metal to the right of the engine lid. This seems like
a logical location, I think that PCA track events requires a battery cut off
accessible to track personel in case of an emergency. In photos I have saved
over the years, I see the switch installed on the front cowl area, the rear
tunk area and in the cockpit. I'm curious as to where other 914 owners would
mount theirs. Suggestions? This is a fair weather car, so I'm not too
concerned about it being mounted on the car's exterior. Also, I stripped and
preped the front trunk area of my 914, it is in satin black primer right now.
I was going to paint it Gaurds red again, just like the body, but I think the
satin black looks cool for some reason. I notice in my work shop manuals, some
of the cars in the photos have black trunk and wheel well areas. Were some 914
delivered this way?  I'm curious, What would you do??
