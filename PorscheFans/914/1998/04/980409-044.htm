Fellow Teeners!!!
        Well I downloaded the FTP file that Mike Cooley suggested and WOW!!
What a source of knowledge. I browsed several of the articles, ok most of the
articles and am busy categorizing them. Once I finish that I'll create a
reference database that I can access at will within Lotus Notes. I am a Notes
Administrator and developer and  this gives me an excuse to practice....  Well
I finally had a chance to pull off the outer rocker covers to determine the
amount of damage to my longitudinals. All I can say at this point is that the
pasenger side has some surface rust but appears to be very solid. The drivers
side has a huge hole where the jack point is and the where the front of the
longitudinal meets the wheel well. is pretty nasty also. Does anyone make a
patch panel for that area? (the wheel well area) My welding skills are not up
to par but I have a cousin who welds for a living. Perhaps I'll finish the job
before the summer ends. While we work on this I plan on upgrading the brakes
and doing some mods to make the car both safer and faster. Hmm what an odd
combinatiokn for me. Perhaps I'll post to the list about the time I had to
weld the engine block into my '68 Mustang vintage racer to pass Mass.
inspection.....

Hope to meet some of you during the East Coast Ramble!! If your not there
perhaps you can make the East Coast Summer Nationals in Worcester Mass over
the 4th of July weekend.
