Well, I spent a couple of hours checking out my car and.... well, I found
stuff I really didn't like. 
#1. As I posted earlier the drivers side inner rocker is rusting, and...
#2. Where the inner rocker meets the inside of the wheel well there is a
creatively                                    Bondo'd hole. Apparently the Po
was really good at Bondo work.... If I hadn't of been poking I wouldn't have
found it...
#3. The panel under the front motor mount is showing it's age. Some rust and a
couple of small holes.
#4. The front motor mount has a Definite cant to the rear of the car. Looks
like a backslash, kinda.
O.k. The question is How many of these pieces do I have to fabricate and how
many  are available (reasonably priced of course)? Welding isn't a problem as
I have a cousin whose a welder by trade and loves the car as much as I do.
AA"s catalog doesn't show a panel for the rear floor area where the front
motor mount attaches.
Oh and what is this paint code supposed to be ....  L 51P (this was all I
could read)
Tips, Advice, Comments, et. al.  greatly appreciated

Forgive the lengthy posting....
