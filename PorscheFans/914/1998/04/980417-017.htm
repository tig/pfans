Hi all,

	Thanks for the responses to my question so far. I have found a few
comonalities.

	First off, our six cylindered friends -all- report noticably lower oil
temperatures. I wonder if this is really indicative of hotter running
engines, or if the sixes have their oil temp senders in relatively
cooler locations. Anyone?
	Secondly, those that reported comfortably low oil temps all have high
pressure cold air being ducted to an oil cooler somewhere. Those that
have oil coolers mounted to their engine lids (or next to the transaxle
without ducting) seem to have higher oil temps (inadequate cooling) than
those with cold-air ducted coolers. 
	Lastly, not one has mentioned running cylinder head temp sensors. I
seem to be the only one. I see 350F+ after merely a short stint at WFO
at high rpms. Makes me nervous to say the least.

	Oil cooler conclusions: If you're going to run sustained high rpm track
driving, meaning WFO throttle at sustained high rpms, you really need an
oil cooler mounted in a cold air stream. Low pressure air or heated air
won't be sufficient. And no one has yet mentioned running a 914 on teh
track without at least an auxiliary oil cooler mounted -somewhere-. And
I still don't know what a good head temp and a dangerous head temp is.
