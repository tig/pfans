Hey all!
Just a quick lil post.
If you remember, I had cc'd the heads on 2.0, and then needed to determin=
e the pistons I had before ordering the cylinder shims.  I thought I had =
euro pistons but wasn't sure.  We then found out that their are a couple =
of dif. euro pistons (Jim T, and Wayne at Pelican) and perhaps these were=
 Kolbenschmidts due to the style of dish.  (Jim T. has them and described=
 the dish).
Well, I finally got the time to cc the piston and heres the latest weird =
thing,  Jim says his pistons had a 4 cc dish in the top, looking at mine =
I was guessing that they were closer to a 1cc dish.  I made a plexi disc =
the same size as the bore (thanks JJ) and measured the dish and came up =
with 1.5 cc!  Now I am really wondering what pistons I have.  I ordered =
the shims from MSHP and since they don't come in the weird sizes I need =
they are sending me the next closest size up and I can sand them down to =
fit.  Sound right?
Also, Jim T. can you send me a copy of your excel compression worksheet? =
Thanks!
And is there any word on when the "combo guage" is going to be ready for =
mass production.  I am planning on it being in the car when i fire this =
baby up! (somewhere around the year 2012)

Thanks!
