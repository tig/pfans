Hello! Were there two different side view mirrors made for the 914?
 
   I've been trying to get a pair for my car for a while (they seem tough to come by), and found one at a swap meet several months ago. Recently, I found another that a lister had and purchased it. Horray! I thought I had a pair but when it arrived it does not perfectly match the first one I had. Both are very similar and do appear to be 914 mirrors, however, there are subtle difference.

  One of the mirrors I have is identical to the one pictured at the Pelican parts web site: (http://www.pelicanparts.com/914/914_sample_parts/914_side_mirror.JPG). This one is about 1/4 longer than the other but is the same height. Notice the round angle on the one picture at the pelican parts site. The other one I have has a round, but much sharper angle. Both mirror have flat glass, the same base, and the same construction. One (the long one with a round angle) is stamped on the back with IIITP-RT210, the other has no stamping.

   Any clue what these mirrors are? Different years maybe?

Thanks,
Steve
