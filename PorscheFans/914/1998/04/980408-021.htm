Hi fellow 914ers, I just got back from a bussiness trip in Nevada. Had 2
interesting hotel rooms.  I stayed at the Sunset Station Hotel, a real nice
place. I checked in and get my room on the 9th floor, room 914. I was
thhinking hey this is cool. I checked out the other day, found out I had stay
one more day, and checked back in. I get another room on the 9th floor, room
916. Strange huh? So anyway it put me in a real 914 mood. I'm driving around
in my rented Olds-mo-buick pretending its a 914. Engine noises and air-
shifting. God I need to finish my car!! Anyway, here is an update on my
project. I now have the GT flares welded on the right side, awaiting primer.
The right rear control arm is boxed and rebuilt, the front suspension is
cleaned, painted, putback together, turbo tie rods installed, 911 front stuts
cleaned and painted and waiting to be attached to car. Now I gotta turn it
around and flare the left side. Also picked up my engine parts from the
machine shop. I really hope to be finished in time for the East Coast Ramble,
at this point though it looks like I'll be bringing photos instead. We'll have
to see if I can get back into pulling all nighters again like I did when I was
20 something and single. 
Some questions for the list: with all of this talk about compression ratios, I
have brand new Mahle 2.0L euro pistons. They have a slight dish on top, looks
like 1 to 1.5 cc w/o actually measuring. There is a bold blue number 8 on the
tops. My question is when I measure the deck height, do I measure from the
dished center of the piston or the raised outer edge of the piston to the top
of the barrel??
Some answers to the list: Mike Cooley asked about painting chrome door
handles. Mike, I did mine 10 years ago and they have held up great. I
wetsanded the chrome with 400 grit sandpaper. Then I primed with a metal
etching primer, and painted with SEM (brand name) Trim Black. It is satin
black, not gloss or flat. These have not chipped flaked or scratched. The only
part you can not paint is the round stainless water shield where the key slot
is. You could also glass bead the chrome to give it some tooth to hold the
paint. The Eastwood Company has a self etch primer and SEM Trim Black in their
catalog in aerosol cans. You can try them, will probably cost about $15. Good
luck.
There was also a question on syncronizing carbs. When I HAD carbs, I used the
4 tube mercury sticks from my motorcycles to balance the carbs. This tool
works very well.You can watch all 4 barrels at one time as you adjust. I had
installed vacum ports on my manifolds under each throttle plate.
Okay, I'll stop burning band width now.
