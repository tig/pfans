It's there to do a 'final tweek' of the ignition timing AT IDLE.
The second port does nothing when the butterfly is not closed.

My understanding is that it advances the timing to ensure a
complete burn under conditions where there isn't enough gas
in the cylinder to cause detonation problems.

I've also heard that the only thing it really does is keep
the second hose from the distributor from flopping around.

Note:  At one time, emissions testing was done only at idle,
and these results were used as an indicator of how well the
emissions control system was working.
