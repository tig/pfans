<<What has been your experience with the durability of Bursch mufflers?>>

Steve, I had the same situation. Actually I was impressed with Bursh's
performance, engine performance, not rust performance. I think most people buy
it for thr header portion anyway. I will have mine Jet Hot coated soon. I am
puttin a new turbo muffler on mine. The muffler crapped out after a few short
years, but the header is thick and solid.

<On a similar note, my headers are jet-hot coated but have some stains from
oil drips. Is there a cleaner to remove these stains from the jet-hot
coating?>>

Not really, once they are ther they are permanent. You can try some very fine
steel wool and then some aluminum wheel polish. I will not remove the stains,
but will make them less noticeable.
