Okay, now I can't sleep, so time to ask several questions that I've been
wondering about.  Sooner or later I have a feeling I'm going to be
diving into a tranny to do some work.

Question one:  How does one get that nut that is halfway down the
mainshaft off?  A twelve inch long 32mm socket comes to mind, but I
don't think that Snap On or Mac makes one just yet...

Questions two:  The Haynes manual says that one must pay attention to
how thick and how many gaskets sit between the intermediate plate and
the main case in order to set gear lash correctly.  Let's just assume
one tore down one's old tailshifter before ordering the manual and
reading that paragraph (which I would never do, of course) and one threw
away anything paperlike at the time.  Is there a way to set that lash?
This hypothetical person is going to mix and match the best parts, and
will not be able to use the "factory settings" ("Use construction paper
on that one Horst, otherwise it'll be too tight") anyway.

Just curious, that's all...
