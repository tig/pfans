Well, I got my car running good enough to go for
  a test drive Sun. One possibly big problem was the
  connector to the fuel pump wasn't seated all the way.
  I also, replaced the Pertronix with the Compufire. It
  seems there is a slight fit problem where the rotor
  doesn't quit seat all the way unless I file off some
  of the base of the rotor. 
    Now for the problem: until the engine gets good and
  warm it cuts out on me weather idling and especially 
  while trying to drive. Could this be a timing problem?
  (I didn't really set the timing because I still have 
   to find the marks and set it up.) Maybe I have a loose
  valve or two and they don't open far enough until warm?
  I know it's hard to figure out when I keep shortcutting
  and not going by the numbers. The next thing I will be
  doing is marking the impeller so I can find TDC. Then I
  can make sure timing is good. Can the impeller be removed
  with the engine in the car? I might take it out to mark
  it and remove the rust but it sound like it makes more
  sense to use the timing mark on the flywheel. What's
  the opinion?
 
             Thanks.
