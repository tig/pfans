  I don't recall who posted that advice either, but if he does not
reply, I will offer this:

  The disk is identical in shape and construction to a standard
freeze plug such as one would find in the side of a water-cooled
engine block.  (Just smaller in diameter and thickness.)   I
understand (although I have not tried to make such a purchase) that
these plugs are available from your FLAPS in a variety of sizes,
including one that should fit the caliper.   If so, (check first) I'd
just punch the thing with a drill and pry it out, planning to replace
it with a new one.   If it's stubborn coming out, you will almost
certainly deform it to the point that a new one will be required
anyway, so I wouldn't plan on trying to repair the old one.

  As for where to drill the hole, I'd recommend the center of the
plug.  If you get off to the side, you could damage the sealing
surface that the plug mates with, or mung up the circlip that holds
the shaft in, if you go deep enough.   If you stick to the center,
the worst that you can do when the drill breaks through is put a
little dimple in the end of the shaft, which won't hurt a thing.  
There is plenty of "meat" there.

  Once you get the hole drilled, just insert a pin punch or something
else equally sturdy, and rotate it around a line perpendicular to the
axis of the lever shaft.  This should first distort and then remove
the plug.

					Good Luck,
                                                            Jim T.
