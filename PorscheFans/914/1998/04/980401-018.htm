Hi Mike!

  I wanted to say thank you for your posts on welding, and now on
throttle body repair.   It seems to me this makes you the resident
expert, so I have a question for you.

  I have a throttle body with two vacuum ports, so I assume that it
is a '73 or earlier, even though it came off a '75 car.  In the case
of this particular throttle body, there is no doubt some shaft wear,
but the thing that has me scratching my head is that when the
butterfly is fully closed, I can see daylight all around the edge of
it except for a couple of contact points, both on the throttle switch
side, that actually limit it's travel.  In addition, there is a # 30
hole drilled in the butterfly between the part number and the shaft. 
 I bet that with this much air leakage when fully shut, there is a
pretty high idle speed!   The part number on the butterfly is
039.133.141.  The throttle body part number is 039.133.067.

   My question is: How did the butterfly get to be so much smaller
than the bore?   Could it be that the butterfly and / or shaft is not
properly located in the direction parallel to the shaft axis?   If
so, can this be corrected?  If it is correctable, how much additional
would you charge to fix this somewhat different problem?

   Any thoughts that you have will be greatly appreciated.

					Thanks,
                                                            Jim T.
