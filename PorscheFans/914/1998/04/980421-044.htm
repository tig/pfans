Ok, all the Sherlocks out there, lets find it for the listmaster.

To those interested. The first below shows 645 members receiving my list
message. The 2nd shows 59 members receiving list mail JOHN DUNKLE had posted.

THE FOLLOWING WAS SHOWN BY MIKE COOLEY ON A POST TO THE LIST

Your following message has been delivered to the 645 members of
  the list 914@porschefans.com at 15:56:07 on 7 Apr 1998.

THE FOLLOWING WAS SHOWN BY JOHN DUNKLE ON A POST TO THE LIST

Your following message has been delivered to the 59 members of
  the list 914@porschefans.com at 13:22:48 on 8 Apr 1998.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


These differences indicate that the list members numbers changed between the
hours and dates shown below. If each of us look for the last time when 645
members received your post and the next post showing 59, we can pinpoint the
exact time this occured and help to solve this. 
If the Listmaster is looking for a reason, it would be logical to see the
history and what changes occured between these moments of time to make the
list be erratic.

PS. JJ, you still there on the 59 remaining members count?



Naturally there will be the current your message has been delivered
to....Blah....blah...blah below this.
