	That's your *oil temp*!?!?!?!?!?  And you still have a motor?
--Can I touch you?  Maybe some of the luck will rub off...  If the oil
in your sump is *really* getting that hot, your motor is probably now
in pieces.
	I have a friend who accidentally ran his 911 (2.7) up to 270 F
down at Buttonwillow.  He now has a new 911, because he decided against
rebuilding that engine.  Oh, and the motor was less than five years old
when he killed it.  (When your idle oil pressure drops below 5 PSI and
has <25 PSI at 5000 RPMs, it's past time to rebuild the sucker...)

	I would like to suggest that your gauge might be off a little
bit.
	To be fair:  I'm not sure where the 911 oil temp sender is, so
911 gauge numbers might be a bit lower under similar conditions than
the reading from a 914 gauge.  But Bruce A. says that 250F is "TOO DAMN
HOT", and your gauge is reading 25-50 degrees higher than that, and 30
degrees above my friends lunched motor!
	So your setup might not be as bad as it appears.  (I hope.)
PA Speedo can calibrate your gauge if you ask.
