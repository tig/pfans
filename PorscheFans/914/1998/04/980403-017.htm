Mike, the 914 Network list the mayeur pieces for $325 / pair; you can
contact Perry Kiehl there at 800-867-4712.  As Dirk mentioned, you
should get the worst of the rust out, cut,  wire brush, etc. I did that,
then applied a weldable zinc primer, Wurth has a good product. After
welding in the new pieces, I then dragged a small diameter hose with a
spray nozzle through the interior of the longitudinal through the access
port in the interior of the car to apply a coating of Waxoyl, a good
preventative measure to keep moisture out of the areas.  Brad Mayeur has
been doing these pieces for 15 years or more, and they are a good method
for repair.  Brad sells these pieces himself, through his shop in E.
Peoria , Illinois, try directory assistance.    Jim S.
