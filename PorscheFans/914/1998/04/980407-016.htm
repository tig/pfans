You may want to look into PMO's (in Santa Monica, CA) new carburetors. 
They are probably the most experienced with Webers for Ps, and undertook
a multiple-year project to improve the design.  Their efforts are
apparently spectacular (better carbs, better fuel economy, easily
adjustable, etc., etc.).  Price is around $1900, with linkage and
stacks.
