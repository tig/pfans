<<the neat little comments they put in to satisfy our inquiring minds, said =
the '547' was formulated especially for Porsche. That's probably why it was =
=
$28, whereas the red and blue were $8! I'm sure there's a logical reason for=
 =
this.......maybe the bottle was three times the size of the blue/red?>>

Tom, if it was Loctite 574, it is a sealer, not a thread locker like the red
and blue. Red and blue thread lockers go on bolt threads to keep them from
coming loose from vibration for example. Red is stronger, blue is for bolts
that will be removed from time to time. 574 is for sealing case halves, case
plugs, cyclinder bases etc. It is an anerobic sealer, it swells and fills
voids and irregularities. This stuff works really well. That is probably why
it cost more than the thread lockers. By the way, it is a small bottle, not 3
time as much. I wish it were though. Hope this answers your question.
