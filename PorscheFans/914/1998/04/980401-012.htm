"Knowledge means nothing unless you share it with others". (M.C.) 

How do you know when the TB is funky junky and needs Bushed?
By Mike Cooley, 
The Southern Knight, fighting high cost of 914 repairs.

In a nutshell, you need the TB reworked when you press the accelerator and
it balks. The butterfly is cockeyed and hanging on the bore walls because
the bosses for the throttle shaft have wallowed out enough to create that
sticking problem. It is not easily detected sometimes because most will
think it is something entirely different and start working on that view.

How to BUSH the TB.
Doing the boss bores require finding the exact center of the original bore
as sent from the factory. How do you do this. You have a very good TB
someone never used enough to harm it(carb instead) and proceed to make a
fixture to hold dead center so you can then set up the wallowed out one you
are going to line bore to bring it back to dead center.

BRAVEHEARTS CAN USE A RIGID DRILL PRESS, R8 COLLET, A FIXTURE and LOTS OF LUCK.

You have to have a vertical milling machine to line bore, must indicate the
good bore on the good TB into perfect center and indicate the linear
trueness. Your fixture remains in this exact position on the milling machine
table after you remove the good TB sample and put it away safely. Never move
the milling machine table laterally. Lock it laterally. You can move it up
or down if needed.

Now you install the one you are going to rework on the still clamped fixture
and must bore both bosses at one time to keep it dead nuts straight. You now
line bore, drill and ream for the oil lite bronze bushing diameter size you
will be using. Finish hole has to be a press fit for the bushing. I use
7/16" OD by 5/16" ID OILLITE Bronze bushings. My final bore for press fit is
..4370 which allows a .0005 press fit. There is no real lateral pressure so
this is plenty. 

Remove the TB from the fixture and press the bronze bushings in, one on each
side of the TB. The bushing lengths will be different so you measure to see
which length goes where. Length left to your particular TB because different
models require different lengths. You do want to be certain that whatever
length you use, NONE should be protruting INSIDE the TB bore. Allow about
1/16" clearance away from INSIDE END of the boss hole inside the bore. BOTH
SIDES. 

Put the TB back on the fixture. With the TB latched on the fixture, you then
drill with a collet holding the drill, 9/32 size drill and drill completely
through both bushed bosses, then you install a .3130 HS straight flute
reamer, using lubricant and ream through WITHOUT stopping until the reamer
emerges from the opposite side bushed boss. Back it out with the reamer
still rotating.

Wait a minute now, you say, the throttle shaft is 8mm in diameter. Yes, I
know, but the throttle shaft is usually worn and you have to compensate for
the wear, so you use a reamer of the size I show, .3130.

You polish the throttle shaft until it is shiny like polished chrome. It
will get hot and warp, so you do it a bit at a time to keep it from warping.
After you have polished the complete shaft, let it sit for 10 minutes until
it is cold. Don't cool in water!!!!!

Try sliding it completely through the TB bushed bosses. Does it go smoothly?
If not, use crocus paper on each end of the shaft, polishing until you can
feel it turning smoothly in 360 degrees rotation when installed completely
in the bosses. Absolutely no binding or minute catches. Must be fluid
feeling and turn freely, but not loose and wobblingly. When this is
accomplished and you feel good about your fit, leave it in the TB with the
flat surface in the center facing up in the center of the TB bore.

The butterfly is brass. Polish it until it shines, but don't polish those
numbers off of it. Go lightly on the edge. This is not to be made undersized.

The Numbers on the TB butterfly must face up. They also must face the same
direction that they did before you took the butterfly plate off or it will
not work properly. I usually use a mark on the outside of the TB for
reference as to the proper direction. I have seen them face different ways
so there is no rule that says which side it will be facing on assembly.

Use NEW screws to attach the butterfly plate to the throttle shaft after you
have reinstalled the throttle valve switch, the black gizmo on the outside.
Install the links, springs, bushings, washers and nut on the other end of
the shaft, checking to see that all is in the correct order. Satisfied? Bend
the retaining washer to one of the flats on the hex nut to hold it all
together. Now turn the TB upside down and stake the two NEW screws lightly
with a small chisel. Lightly, You don't want to bend the shaft.

Check your throttle butterfly action. Does it snap into closed throttle
position when you release the accelerator linkage on the side of TB. Does it
open without any hesitation when you press the linkage with your hand. Good huh.

To set your throttle valve electronic switch, see my illustration. Don't
have it. I offered it to all of you free, so now ask me how you can get it.
$.32 is the price of a stamp, put on a self addressed long envelope and send
to me and I will send you the adjustment procedure, illustrated, so even a
dummy like me can do this likely needed procedure even if you don't bush
your TB.
