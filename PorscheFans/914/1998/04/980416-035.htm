Yep, found some similar stuff on mine - you're not alone.... Bu before
you read this response, grab a beer (or two) - you'll need a couple.....

My suggestion is not to go with the AA Clamshell but rather, the Brad
Mayeur (sp?) piece...  Brad's piece is structurally sounder with a
heavier gauge.  Do both sides at the same time, 'cause if you don't, you
are only delaying the inevitable....

Front or back wheel well?  Fronts are no problem - take a piece of 18
gauge and bend to fit.  If it's the rear, well, then you have a
structural problem  The longitudinal wrap around the rear section...(See
below...)

There are a couple of pieces in there - if your referring to the engine
tray, replacement parts are cheap and plentiful.. If you are refering to
where it ties into the body/structure, well, get ready for some major
welding and re-work.  Keep in mind that these areas tend to rust from
the inside out - so most of the major rust you *can't* see, but will
disintegrate when you go to weld them (the torch will blow through the
metal when you strike it.).  This is also a critical suspension area, so
be prepared for some time, money and swearing...

OK, so finish your first beer?  Start your second - now!  The mounts tie
into the rear longitudinal near the suspension console (just forward of
them).  My best guess is that if the mounting bracket is gone, then so
is the inner longitudinal and probably the suspension console on that
side...  Parts?  $300 - $600 per side depending on what's good versus
bad.  Time? Count on 20 - 30 hours per side (cutting out the rot, prep,
welding, finish, etc.)

Suggestion - if you like your cousin at all, tell them beforehand what
they are up against....  But, having done all the stuff you are
referring to recently, yep, it's worth it..

Good Luck..
