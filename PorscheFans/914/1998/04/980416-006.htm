That sounds like the wrong mark.  If the 74 is like my 73 2.0L  it is like
this (going from memory).  Standing behind the car and looking forward the
fan turns counterclockwise,  the right side of it comes up over the top and
down toward the left.  The fan should have 2 marks.  The one you come to
first is the 27deg BTDC mark.  The next is the 0deg or TDC mark, there is
no static mark.

You time it dynamically to the 27deg BTDC mark at 3500rpm, have the vac
lines to the dist removed and plugged.  If you timed it statically to that
mark then you are running way too advanced.  You'd think it wouldn't run
but I know it will.  Mine was like that when I got from the PO.  You could
get it close statically, I think mine would be about 5deg BTDC, this is
something like one fan blade width to the left of the TDC mark.

The dist rotates CW when the engine is going in the correct direction.

Subject:  Timing....




Ok. I found 2 marks on the inside of the impeller.
  I adjusted static timing to the left mark and now I can't
  seem to get my idle down.
    Questions:1)Which mark is the right one, looking with
  a mirror, I'm calling the left one the one you come to
  first with the impeller going toward the driver side;
  2)Is the mark on the flywheel the only way to really
  verify which one is correct on the impeller;(By "right
  one" I mean TDC.)
  3)Can you see TDC with a strobe type timing light once
  static timig has been set?
  4)Which way do you rotate the dizzy when coming up to
  the light comming on, when doing the static adjustment,
  cw or ccw?
   Thanks
