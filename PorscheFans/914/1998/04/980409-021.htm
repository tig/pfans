In a message dated 98-04-09 11:44:54 EDT, you write:

<< As a matter of fact, OUR good friend, John
 Dunkle, just now asked how my trim was black and I replied painted, but
 comes off too easy. I pasted your info for a more secure application. >>
Mike, I should also mention that I did all of my trim this way. All chrome and
aluminum trim was painted satin black. 10 years and it still looks like new. I
also painted my chrome bumpers body color, they were dented and pitted badly,
this way and they too look great. I had used DuPonts Vari-Prime self etch
primer, I don't think its available any longer due to the chemicals used in
it. There are newer self etch primers available now. The key is to clean the
chrome areas well, sand with 400 grit, corser if using a building primer, and
an etching primer.

<<I can see that I will sure be missing a
good gathering of great 914 friendship and FUN when the East Coast Ramble
takes place. How I wish!!!! Just think of the others who do not make it and
toast one for all the rest of us.>>

Mike, you will be missed. I would like to meet you in person some time. I
appreciate all of the time and information you post to the list on a weekly if
not daily basis. Don't worry though, John Dunkle and I have made a commitment
to drink as much as neccessary to toast all of the list member who cannot make
it.
