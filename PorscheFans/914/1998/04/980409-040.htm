List members wanting to bush their throttle bodies.
This is NO JOKE. I haven't gone Nuts. This one is for ALL of you with the
factory fuel injection 914's throttle bodies. 1st in 1st out. No exceptions.

OK. I see there is no need of me forsaking those who need this done. Once
again, ALL that need and wish to rebush them, send a message, but direct it
to the list ONLY under subject FIX-ME-NOW. I will receive it since I read
the List mail. I want everyone to count the total. I will need 60 TB to get
it off the ground. Once that amount is promised, things will begin. I will
do only one per day as that is necessary for me. I have a fixture and will
be using Heavy duty Drill Press to do the work. Volume will get me better
machinery and better quality in a short time if I can reach the 150 mark on
volume.
  
What I will do:
Clean the TB and all metal on the linkage. Drill and bush the throttle body.
The shaft will be polished and fitted to the bushing. Polish the butterfly.
Fit it all back until it is absolutely smooth feeling to me. Install new
butterfly screws and peen them. Install your throttle switch and set it to
the TB closed and Wide open throttle position. Priority Mail it back to you
or whatever you pay for shipping outside the 48 states.
What I will NOT do: 
Polish the throat, or outer throttle body, repair idle adjustment screws,
loose ones but will free up frozen ones. I cannot guarantee the threads will
be good since all I am doing is freeing the frozen screw to be able to
adust. Risk will be yours.

How much do I charge:
Make me a offer I can't refuse plus $3 for each throttle body cost of
mailing by Priority Mail back to you. Out of the United states mail will
cost what it costs you to send to me using same service for return to you
postage.
Already lost ALL my money, so what the heck is a million or 2 more. This is
OUR list and I want to help as I can to keep the 914 where it should be. On
the road, the track and getting to the EVENTS. Please do not try to take an
advantage of me. It can stop immediately. Offer is open to anyone who has a
914 and a member of our list. Businesses included. No volume limits but 5
limit in a month for businesses. I have to pay taxes on any amount that you
offer so please consider this all you GODFATHERS as you make me an offer I
can't refuse.
  
How long will it take:
Allow one full day in my possession and 3 days each way for mail in USA. If
you send more than one, one day for each. Weekends not included. I gotta
drive mine sometimes you know. I do NOT have loaners. 
When to be Mailed by you: 
By Personal e-mail confirmation by me to you. 
 
I will back out if the number is less than 60 within 10 days from date on
THIS message which will be time stamped as I mail it.
JUNK will be returned as JUNK so if it's JUNK don't send it. 
Use Priority Mail Only when sending in USA. It's affordable shipping.

You must use cushion packing to assure nothing get damaged in shipping. I
will use your same container and packing to return to you.

* NOTE: I reserve the right to refuse ANY ridiculous offers for my services.

Happy Easter this weekend.
Mike
