I think only the "California" 75-76 914's had catalytic converters... my '76
doesn't.  I think the biggest "power robber" on the '76 was the smog pump,
which is powered by the crank.  By loosening two bolts and removing a belt,
you get that power back.  I think someone might have said something about a
different set of heat exchangers that weren't as effective as the earlier
ones, but the earlier heat exchangers bolt on without a problem.  I can't
think of anything else that would make an early 2.0 more powerful than a
75-76 2.0 with no smog pump and an early exhaust.  The only other thing that
I can think of would be the bumpers (which weight about 40 lbs each), but
those too can be replaced.  Mine have been replaced with 2 lb aluminum
frames to support the rubber cover, which I figure weighs about 4 lbs, so my
6 lb bumpers might actually be a little lighter than the earlier chrome
bumpers.  FWIW, I saw an early 914 in the Rocky Mountain News with a
professional V6 conversion for $7000...

Well, the dude with '76 orginal mars red 58000 miles etc. etc.
REPAINTED THE DAMN THING BLACK!  Arrrg!  $300 job from Maaco!  'Cause he
felt like it!  Still wants to sell it, but he raised the price.  So much
for entering it in a concourse.  Oh yeah, anyone looking for a BLACK '76
914 with red door sills, lemme know.  I'll send you the number.  Still a
good car, but being a 76 and requiring repainting (in my mind) I'm
dropping it from my list of possibles.  Probably would still go for it,
but I just drove a '73.  Lots more power, but over priced with rockers
that look three layers deep from brazing, body work his son did, etc.
Yech.  Okay, I'll stop venting.  It's late and I'm crabby.

Not gonna buy it, but I was curious:  Other than the air injection and
cat, what other differences are there that drop the power compared to
73/74?  I was thinking a cam.  Any ideas?

Oh yeah.  Any good leads on decent (relatively rust free rockers) 73/74
2.0 cars in the Colorado area, let me know.  Willing to do some driving
for a good one.
