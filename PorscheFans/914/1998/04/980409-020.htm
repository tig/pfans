have.

Mike, They (the pistons and barrels) are in a brand new box with the Mahle
logo all over it. I got them from Engine Builders Supply approx. 6 months ago
.. They had several sets on sale at that time. I think I paid a little less
than $500. I posted it to the list at that time. I originally thought that
mine were flat on top, however I just had them out of the box the other day
and noticed a very shallow dish in the centers of them. I will let you know
the exact cc of the dish when I measure them.
