Dirk, listers-

So I think what I'm looking for is a combo of the Petronix to get rid of =
the points and the Crane Hi 6 or MSD to up the spark itself?  But the MSD=
 doesn't allow you to use your stock tach or needs some adapter,  So I =
want to go towards the Hi 6?  And it also has an adjustable rev limiter =
as well?  Am I right?

And if you have 2 of these Petronix thingys do you now have Petroni or =
Petronixs?

Thanks!

me!
