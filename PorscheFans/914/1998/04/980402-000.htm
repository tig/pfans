As I said earlier, these itenms will be thrown out tomorrow
(Thursday) night unless someone drives by and takes them away:

    FREE:  Two stock 914 seats (black):  One is in ok condition, 
           except for tears in the seat-cushion seams; the other is
           in really poor condition.  Both are mechanically sound;
           the "ok" one just needs new vinyl, and the other one needs
           new foam and vinyl. No mounting brackets.

           These seats are perfect for those of you who are planning
           to restore your cars... If you put them in your car for
           the "before" photos, the "after" photos will look
           INFINITELY more impressive.

    FREE:  One 914 seat-mounting bracket:  This is the bracket that
           attaches to the seat, not the car.  The adjuster-handle
           has -- as they always do -- broken off.

    FREE:  One 914 windshield-washer tank with cap and hose.

    FREE:  One steel 914-4 wheel with 165R15 Sears Road Handler
           tire.  Doubles as a pressure source for the
           above-mentioned windshield-washer tank.

    FREE:  Two stock 914-4 torsion bars.

    FREE:  Two 914-4 axles with CV joints.  One CV joint is broken;
           the rest are (presumably) ok.

    FREE:  Two 16" Tripledge windshield wipers.  New, never been
           used. These wipers fit lots of cars, although they don't
           fit the 914.

In my opinion, none of this stuff is worth shipping, so I'm
looking for someone local to take it off my hands... I'm about
thirty miles north of San Diego, California.

If you're interested, let me know in private email.
