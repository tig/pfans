It pressed down on the shift rod and broke the ear on the transaxle where
the shiftlinkage has the cup and ball.

Hey Bernie,
I had this same problem with my '74 a few years back.  When mine came
loose it also took out the starter, shifter ear, and shift rod. It also
put a heathy dent in the bottom of my trunk.  I went to Zims (less than a
mile from where it happened) and got all new torque-head (as in torque
driver head) bolts and  I put in new lock washers.  The CV joint promptly
started to come apart on me again.  
The problem you see is there are two roll pins in the CV joint that hold
it in place and transmit the torque to/from the trans.  If you don't have
these roll pins then the bolts take the energy from the trans, and they
will work loose.  I found some roll pins at DC Racing (another local guy)
and haven't had a problem since.  
I know a lot of local guys use the split type lock washers and recommend
them, they have worked for me.  I also know someone who uses red
locktight, which is overkill for me. Personally, I think I'm going to
drill the bolts for safety wire next time I have it apart, or the time
after that, or after that....
Any way, the trans ear is an easy fix.  Find someone who has a junk trans
and borrow/steal theirs.  It's an easy bolt off/on kind of thing.  Same
with the shift rod, the bent ones don't work so well so get a new/used
one.
Have fun with the car.  If everything goes well this will be the last
time you have to fix this problem.  So you can get to others :-)
