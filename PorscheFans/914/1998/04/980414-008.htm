	Add a hex-shaped hole in the "outer" end (so you can use an
Allen wrench to put them on and take them off), and you have a screw-
in stud kit.  I have half a kit, I think--two wheels worth.
	They have the standard VW/Porsche threads on one end, and the
standard US-spec lug-nut threads on the other.  Pretty convenient
when you want to change your tires.
	Unfortunately, the studs are too short for the alloy wheels
on the rear of the car.  (That's why I think I have half a kit.)  Not
only that, but one of these little gems stripped its hole in the
front hub one day while I was torquing the wheels.
	I don't remember if I threw that second half out or not--
that's why I *might* have a full kit, or maybe just a half.

	To state it shortly:  They suck.  I assume that the kit was
designed with Bugs (with steel wheels) in mind, and it *might* be OK
for that.  Don't use them on your 914.
	If you do your own, that is a different matter.  As long as
you can make *sure* that you have enough thread engagement, and that
you have enough anti-seize on things, and that you have some way of
preventing the stud from screwing farther and farther into the hub,
and...  As long as you can make sure that everything is done right,
they should work wonderfully.
	Of course, if you're racing anywhere, your wheel lugs might
not pass tech.
	And, if you screw up somewhere and your lugs fail, you might
be lucky enough to only wind up with body and suspension damage.  Or
maybe not.  (After seeing a 911 lose a wheel at an autoX, I *know* I
do not want to go through that, especially on the street where there
are cars, pedestrians, telephone poles, and other obstacles to free
movement.)
