I've been experiencing a sticking throttle ever since my shot one was
replaced with a "new" used one.  I initially suspected either the cable or
perhaps the pedal, but that's not the case.  If I disconnect the throttle
cable completely and move the butterfly valve with my hand, I find that it
binds (a lot) when closed, and moves smoothly after you get it opened a
little.  After reading Mike's message about re-bushing them, it sounds like
this is what I need to have done.  Unfortunately, I do not have the
equipment (or skills) to do this myself.  Does anyone know of a shop that
can rebuild the throttle bodies?  If not, does anyone have a good spare that
they'd be interested in letting go (cheap)?

Thanks again,

J.J. Slowik
