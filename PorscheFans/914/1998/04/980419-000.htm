Yeah, just a couple observations. I've seen several sets of rocker arms and
they all had brown stains from I assume coked (overheated) oil. The stains
are hard to get off the shafts too. (not even bon ami and a scotchbrite pad
works sometimes) Also, I've seen several cases where the rocker journals
were seriously spawled, presumably from oil failure. As a result, I plan on
getting several parts Armoloy coated to prevent this and hopefully improve
things somewhat. It just shows to me that the cooling of this motor is
marginal and some good application of coating technology, along with some
plating in the right places is needed. Of course, de-flashing the cylinder
heads can't hurt either. Mine had several passages blocked off by left over
casting flashing.
