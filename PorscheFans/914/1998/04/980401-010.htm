	I'm gathering information, friends. We have a 14 month old
baby and a new Fisher-Price front facing mega seat. Does anyone here
have personal experience with putting a toddler in a front-facing 
seat in the MIDDLE of a 914? Separate passenger seat model or like
my old '71 with the passenger seat built into the firewall upholstry?
Short trips, long trips? I seem to recall that the '71's body stickers
id'ed it as a 3 passenger vehicle- but I don't recall if it had a third
set of seat belts.

	The baby seat's got Reccaro size side bolsters, a very
confidence-inspiring seat. Steel tube frame, five point belt.

	Alternately, is anyone close enough to Oakland to drive
over for a cuppa coffee and try it out, maybe give my wife a demo ride?
I guess Dave Darling and I could meet for lunch and try installing the
now-supersceded rear-facing seat backwards as a starting point... Dave,
you down with that sometime after tax day?

	Cheers!
