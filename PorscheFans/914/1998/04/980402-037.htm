My first response would be that the coil/battery makes the electricity
around a spark plug,  but then I saw that wasn't the question and the post
was dated today (not yesterday!)

A thermocouple will also produce a voltage and it is temperature related.
I don't recall the exact way it works either, last time I studied them was
in high school...
Something about two dissimilar metals that are connected producing a voltage
when one of them is at a different temperature.
But these produce very small voltages/currents,  is what you saw on your
stove a small amount of juice?

Just thought I would venture a guess...
