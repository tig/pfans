   Well... sort of....

I did write to Porsche, and they said:  

" During the model year 1970 up to model year 1976 we built the
vehicles of the type 914 in cooperation with the Volkswagen AG.

In those years we equipped the four cylinder vehicles with engines 
made by Volkswagen and the six cylinder vehicles with engines made 
by Porsche.

Since we never had any problems concerning extended cylinder head 
temperature we did not find necessary to publish technical data to
this topic in our workshop manual.  "

  They then went on to describe how to test the Temp Sensor II for
the D-Jet fuel injection.

   I then wrote to VW, and they sent me some excerpts from the shop
manual covering timing and head rebuilding... the upshot being that
they don't know either.

   Therefore, we have only anecdotal data... here is what I have:

   My own engine runs between 350 and 375 on the gauge... it gets to
350 pretty quickly, which seems to me to be due to the thermostat...
it hovers around 350 to 375 most of the time, so I am guessing that
that's where it's regulated.  Caveats:  I have never checked the
gauge calibration;  I am measuring at only one point, right under the
Temp Sensor II,   and this engine has not run long enough to tell
what sort of problems might develop.

  Now, we have other data from R. D. Rick and myself:

  R.D. Rick:  "The overtemp light on the Corvair trips at 450 F.  It
is bolted in
one corner of the head."

  And my co-worker Brian (Beechcraft owner)  told me that the
Lycoming (or maybe 
Continental, I forget which) aircraft engine redline is 475 F for the
normally aspirated version, and 500 F for the turbocharged version.

 Stephen Jacobs reports:

" have just stumbled over some forgotten information.  I have an old
Chevy bulletin on cyl. head temps for Corvairs.

The skinny is as follows:

200 - 300 degrees (F) at idle
350 - 475 degrees (F) at 30 to 60 MPH cruise
460 - 575 degrees (F) full throttle from 3000 - 5000 RPM"

  However, I have never seen a Corvair engine apart where the crank
didn't exhibit the same blueing effect that you see on motorcycle
chrome exhaust pipes where they exit the head, so maybe those
temperatures are a bit high.   I have no explanation for the
discrepancy between R. D. Ricks data and Stephen's, but a posible
reason could be that Stephen's data is earlier, and after having
troubles in the field, Chevy decided to revise downward to 450.  
This is only speculation... do not take it as fact.

   And lastly, Mike Nugent points out:

On a similar note, I've been "researching" oil temp data.  From
UPFIXIN'  Volume IV, I learned, "The straight facts are that the (2.0
oil)
temperature gauge was calibrated somewhat on the conservative side,
and it read
low." and Richie Ginther's 1.7 racer "likes cylinder head
temperatures of
around 200 (degrees) C., at the cylinder head." [pages 260 and 234,
respectively].

Assuming that last number isn't a typo, a 1.7 racer would "like" 392
degrees F cylinder temp (check my math, just in case).   I've never
had a
cylinder temp gauge, so you who have will need to tell the rest of us
how that
sounds."

   So.... this is all that I have been able to glean from my files on
the subject...  the bottom line seems to be that nobody knows...   I
myself intend to take the ostrich approach:  I will observe what my
gauge says, compare it to the numbers given by the various people
above, and decide that whoever comes closest to what I actually
observe must be correct... that way, I don't have to take any
corrective action. 

  There are one or two people on the list who are threatening to
instrument their engines with thermocouples  and develop some real
data.   If we can get enough data on enough different engines,
especially if we can get some on engines that fail, then perhaps we
will have something.  Failing that, I can think of nothing else
except to find a professional metalurgist / mechanical engineer and
have him do a thermal budget analysis with an eye to metalurgical
limitations, or test a dozen engines to destruction on a test stand
and arrive at an answer empiracally.

   As it stands, I don't even know if we are limited by metalurgical
constraints or oil temperature in the heads... However, I tend to
think that the limits are metalurgical, because 350 is already too
hot for most oils.

   Anybody out there care to put in their $.02 worth?
