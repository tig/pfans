I just got back from a race this weekend so I am late in getting my
mail.
I was in Savannah for a SCCA race in my EP 914.  The weather was a bit
humid and the temp, was in the 80's.  I have a 1.8L engine that is 12 to
1 comp.  I have two 24 row oil coolers mounted behind the foglight and
horn grills and no stock oil cooler.  I have only 12 blades on my fan
and the shourd is off a late model bus so it does not have header ducts
on the bottom.  I duct air off the head lights to the fan.  During the
19 lap race my cylinder head temp was 300 my oil temp 240  and oil
pressure stayed at 70psi.  The engine was a little rich for the weekend
so my temps were a little cooler.  There was another 914 down there and
he had the electric fan on it.  He said that his car was over heating. 
His cyl. head temp gauge only went to 340 and it was pegged, and his oil
temp was high and losing oil pressure.  I do rebuild my engine about
every 4 race weekends so longevity of the engine is no big deal as long
it stays together for the weekends, and so far no machanical failures to
report.  I also won my class this weekend against some great EP cars a
Datson 2000 an MGB, VW Scricco, RX-7, and the other 914.
