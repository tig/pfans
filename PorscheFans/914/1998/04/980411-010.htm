I hauled my old aux. oil cooler over to the car wash and cleaned it out with
the low pressure spray and liberal amounts of BrakeCleen, followed by a full
minute of the "No Spot" mineral-free rinse water.  I can see where the pipe
got folded and broke, but it looks like it'll be a pain to fix.  So, I
called a friend of mine and he said he'd let me have one of his Rx7 oil
coolers cheap.  From what I've heard, they're really nice, and all of the
911 racers seem to love them.  My old oil cooler measured 10 x 4 x 4, and
was suspended from a steel plate mounted to the front bumper.  The new oil
cooler measures 21 x 4 x 1, so before I attempt to fabricate a new steel
plate for the front end, I though I'd ask the list if there might be a
better (more convienient) place to mount this thing... any ideas?

Oh yeah, I went to the hardware store and picked up the stuff to make a new
front valance using the rubber molding found along the walls in bathrooms,
etc.  I was really surprised, it came out really nice!  I can't remember
who's idea this was, but thanks!
