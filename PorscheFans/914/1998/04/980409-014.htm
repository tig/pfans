Hi Steve.

Re: your blown axle (what a relief, I'll bet!):

>So, has anyone been through this procedure before?
>How do I remove the axle from the wheel end?
>Are there any special tools required?
It's pretty easy ... as soon as you remove the axle nut (around 300 ft-lbs
of torque -- some obscene number) you should be able to tap the stub axle
back out of the hub/trailing arm with little or no effort.

Do not put weight on that wheel or roll the car while the stub axle is out
-- you will destroy the wheel bearing.

Leave the stub axle on the outer CV joint unless you absolutely feel the
need to overhaul / inspect / replace that end.

On the inner end, there's a circlip that keeps the CV joint's inner race
from coming off the axle. Remove it (a small screwdriver or two may work
better than an expanding circlip plier), and then in some cases you'll be
able to hammer the axle (use a plastic-faced dead-blow hammer) off of the
inner race. But a hydraulic press will be much simpler.

Then undo the (small-diameter) clip that's holding the boot to the axle,
and pull the boot off, and you're done.

Installation is basicaslly the reverse, and again, a press makes it easier
to install the CV joint, which is installed as a complete, assembled unit.
At some point you have to grease the entire CV joint. I use a Snap-On
torque multiplier to achieve the proper torque on the axle nut upon
reassembly.

I've found RedLine's (synthetic) CV joint grease to work very well.

There was an article several months ago (in excellence, I think) about the
folks running 993 twin turbos at Daytona and how they solved their CV
destruction problem(s). It involved using ever-so-slightly undersized balls
in the CV joint, along with some exotic, sticky lubricant.

Hope this helps, and I'd be interested to know which part(s) of the CV
joint broke.
