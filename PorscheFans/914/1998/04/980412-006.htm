914ers,  (all 60 of you!)

Over the past couple of weeks, I've put a couple of messages out concerning
the ever present 914 brake bleeding woes.  I've finally got them licked
with better than expected end results.

I started off by replacing the front strut/brake assembly with a unit off
of a 1972 911 with M calipers (thanks Pat) and new vented rotors.  I then
moved the front 914 calipers to the rear and installed them with spacers
between the mounting ears and calipers.  The banjo fittings were also taken
off the old front hard lines for use on the new rears.  This allowed me to
use the existing hard lines from the old rear calipers with just a little
tweaking.  New 914-6 rotors completed the rear (thanks Pelican).  By the
way, I now have a nice used set of rear 914 calipers available if anyone
wants them.  Make me an offer.

New braided lines also were fitted.  Then the first bleeding was attempted.
 After about a gallon of fluid, notta!  So I started investingating the
ordiginal, cruddy looking MC.  It appeared to be leaking back into the
pedal cluster, so I replaced it with a new 19mm unit.  This helped a little
on the next bleeding, including the use of Perry K's pressure bleeding
tool, but I was still not satisfied with the pedal feel.  

After 'listening' closely to the lines, I realized a lot of air gurgling
noise was coming from the proportioning valve.  So I took that off and
replaced it with a simple 'T' fitting from Stoddard's.  The goy at
Stoddard's said it was a 356 part, but had a 914 number associated with it?
 Strange...  A couple of friends helped me bleed the brakes again yesterday
using the old-fashioned pump-the-pedal method.  With the proportioning
valve out of the way, we finally got a rock hard pedal in about 15 minutes.  

Combine the new parts, caliper combination and Hawk Blue's in the front
with Performance Friction Carbon Metallic's in the rear, and the first test
drive on the streets around my house produced a 914 which stops VERY
QUICKLY!  All I could think was WOW!  I can safely say that it stops better
than my Neon ACR.  The only thing left to do is install a better
proportioning valve in the cockpit if I even need it.  Next weekend's first
autocross should prove this.

Later,
