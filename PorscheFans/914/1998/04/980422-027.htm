I had been wondering the same thing.  Is there any way to attach an ohm
meter to the HT sensor and monitor it while driving, or would that screw up
the HT sensor reading?

Jim brings up a very good point. Has anyone meaasuer the resistance of
the HT sensor when the engine is -HOT-? I mean right after it's been
screaming along in the heat at high rpms and all that. I suspect that
the resistance drops pretty darn low, and as far as I know, there is no
cutoff in the mapping of the ECU. Meaning it just keeps leaning out the
mixture as the heads get hotter and hotter.

I also don't know where this 122F number comes from, but that's just
plain -cold- for a head temperature. My limited research has found that
400-450F is a reliable redline for the HT and 325-375 can easilly be
expected for normal operating temperatures. If this is a linear device
(which I doubt), then the resistance of the HTS at operating temperature
of ~300F is practically zero, a short.

Hmm, so is the system designed to be at zero resistance when the heads
are at optimal temp? Or is it designed for warmup efficiency, and hot
heads were not given too much consideration? I'm just tossing this
question out there to generate discussion, I'd like to find this out...
