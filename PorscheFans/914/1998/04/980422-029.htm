	You can approximate what the sensor would see by pre-
heating your oven to 400F (if that's what you're sure it is
seeing), then sticking the sensor in for a while.  Grab it and
measure quick, and don't burn yourself!
	Of course, if you're *really* interested in figuring
out what the reading is, you can add an extra wire into the
connector on the sensor side (cut off the old connector, put
the new one on two wires instead of one).  Then run the new
wire (it's gotta be long!) into the cockpit, and use an ohm-
meter on it.  Not appropriate for the racetrack, but it should
work for highway runs.
	If you're worried about the ohmmeter and FI interfer-
ing with each other (and I might be concerned they'd make each
other misread), you can leave the meter off until you get to
where you want to test.  Then shut off the motor and turn on
the meter.  Or have an accomplice turn the meter on and read
it--that's a bit safer.
	And if you do that, write us a note and let us know
what the figures look like!
