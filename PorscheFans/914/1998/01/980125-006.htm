My 75 did not come with an orginal front swaybar.  And let me start by
saying  that my swaybar is still sitting in the basement waiting for a warm
day to install.

However, the Weltmeister kit (including reinforcements) comes wil detailed
instructions and templates for cutting holes in places already stamped in
the inner fenders by the factory.  It appears to be a clear cut install
(compared to many things I have done).

Secondly, I have been advised by several experts *not* to weld the inner
reinforcements into place.  The bolts will hold just fine without welds (as
long as you buy the extra inner reinforcements).

As for the original question of which swaybar for street and autocross,
general consensus seems to point to the 23mm adjustable units.  That way,
you can adjust from nothing to overkill without changing the setup.
Although there appear to be several alternatives around, I opted for the
Weltmeister
