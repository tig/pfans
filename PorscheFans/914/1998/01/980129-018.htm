<I'm looking at a '75 2.0 with a valve guide that has come loose.  The
seller has explained that the heads have not been rebuilt in awhile, so I
would like to just have the heads rebuilt.  My questions is, what all
work
would you recommend when rebuilding the heads?

<Here is what I have come up with so far:
     new valve guides (bore, seat, and ream)
     new valves (the current ones have endured one rebuild already, no
sense pushing it)
     new valve springs
     new pushrod tube seals (any other seals?)

These come with the top end gasket set.

    < valve cover gaskets (any other gaskets?)

Same as pushrod tube seals.

<The seller tells me that the valve seats are great, there are no cracks
in
the heads, and the rocker assemblies are fine.  I mentioned possibly
flycutting the head and he says that he doesn't see a need. 

He's right

< In fact, the
only other thing he recommends attending to is to have the air injection
holes welded up (he plugged the ends but does not think the threads will
last through another removal).

Hmmmm. Might have a problemo here Brett. Smog laws in Georgia apply down
to 1975 model year, I think. Read same for carbs.

<The car is currently carbed, although all the original FI pieces will
come
with the car so it can be converted back if I want. 


Find out about the smog situation, first, IMHO.

<So what else should I have attended to or inspected while I'm in there?

If you have the engine out, anyway, check the clutch disk, look at the
seals behind the flywheel and in front of the transmission. Since you
will have it all apart, you might spring for the new bushings for the
shift-rod. You will need two new gaskets for the CV joints (several
dollars thru AA).

Before you put the heads back on hone each pushrod tube bore. Contact me
before you put the pushrod tubes back in so you can learn from my
mistakes (read oil leaks).

Oh, BTW I've got the Stephens Machine info for you.
