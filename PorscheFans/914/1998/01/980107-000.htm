I'm sold on hydraulic lifters. Web Cam makes a nice set I hear.

If you've got the money, Pauter Machine Co. makes a nice set of needle
bearing aluminum rocker arms with roller tips. 

I'm told that

Yes, that works.

Do a competition valve job, cc and flow test the heads. Use ceramic coatings
on the combustion chamber, valves and piston tops. Get the fins on the jugs
aluminized (aluminum metal sprayed onto sand blasted cast iron fins). If you
have the money, Pauter also makes lightweight connecting rods (about 600$).
You might even consider custom pistons (lighter and forged). Get the case
decked so that the mounting surface for the jugs is perfectly parallel with
the axis of the crank (some people say that all cases are warped and need
this). Look in a Hot VW's magazine to find Pauter Machine.
