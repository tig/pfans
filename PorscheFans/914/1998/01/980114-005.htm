Recent topics on SS valves, dropped valve seats, and lead additives has gotten
me thinking recently.  I have owned my 914 for about 4 months now and have
heard of many people who have dropped a valve seat (so many people it scares
me).  How big of a problem is this really?  Anyway, I was thinking that many of
our 914's were designed to run on leaded fuel (at least I'm pretty sure that is
the case for '70-'71, I'm not sure about '72-'74, and '75-'76 were obviously
designed for unleaded fuel).  I believe that the lead served a number of
purposes, one of which was to lubricate the valves and seats.  Does anyone know
if there were any design changes made to the engines to accomodate unleaded
fuel?  My thinking is that in the absense of the lead lubricant, valves can
more easily stick increasing the possibility of dropping a valve seat.
Along these lines, I have heard some people (well, more like one) who recommend
using a little Marvel Mystery Oil as an additive to the fuel, which may help to
lubricate the valves and decrease the chances of dropping a seat.

Any thoughts?
