John,

	The trick on the East-Coast is to put a beetle rear "T" in were
the proportioning valve is and  CUT the line near the shift lever and
splice in the TILTON adjustable valve (not the knob one but the one with
a lever), then mount it so it fits in the heater control location or if
you still have heat then use the hand throttle position.

For PCA racing the correct thing to do is Lock the unit so that it can
not be adjusted during a race, but you can still find the best setting
in pratace.

Harry Hall (chief Steward) agreed that the 914 came from the factory
with an adjustable valve so as long as it is not adjustable during a
race, it is ok, Plus it is only $50 and the factory part is $300 and
fails.

	Subject:	Brakes & Proportioning Valve

	Quick question for the collective wisdom:

	I'm planning the  re-installation of the front suspension and
will be
	using an 911 SC suspension/brakes, 911 master (19 MM) cylinder,
	converted rears (5 bolt, brake calipers, etc. - thanks Rich..)
and SS
	lines. My question is this. The current brake system uses the
	proportioning valve  - do I keep that valve in the updated brake
system
	or bypass it altogether with a hydraulic T fitting?  If I keep
it, are
	there adjustments that need to be made to it in the conversion
process?

	Thanks in advance....

	John Dunkle
