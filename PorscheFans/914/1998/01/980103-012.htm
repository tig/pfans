Wow Jim, You've been busy!! It also looks like you got some great results!!

My only suggestion to cool the motor down is to use Tech Line Powerkote
Cermet Coating on the tops of the pistons, the combustion chamber, the
exhaust ports, the exhaust valve and the face of the intake valve. They
have 2 different types, one for aluminum (non-ferrous), and one for steel.
You have to clean the metal with bead blasting, then spray with an air
brush, then bake in the oven, then hand polish. I called them and they said
that air cooled VW motors are an excellent application for thier products.

Also, if you are really extreme, get the outsides of the jugs copper or
zinc plated. Anything to keep them from rusting. Copper and zinc conduct
heat much better than iron, so the jugs will stay cooler that way.
