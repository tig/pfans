Yeah, thanks for the support! I'm chained to the BMW 2002 unless someone
waves about 5,000$ in my face (fat chance!). I just spent 3,500$ on rust
repair, plus I've got another few thousand in parts. Damn, I sure can spend
the money, can't I? I've contemplated a 914 corvair, but someone suggested
it would reduce the value of the car, so I'm reluctant to do such a
conversion, plus, I've made a lot of progress in repairing my motor, so I
don't want to waste that. 

My wife does like Corvairs, as well as BMW's. She doesn't like the 914 so
much, too noisey.

Yeah, we've all got them, thanks for sharing.

Being "inside the beltway" I'm saturated with this news. Hell, a grand jury
is convening as I right this. But, I agree with a lot of what you said. I
feel pretty much the same way, but I'm more cynical than you, I think.
