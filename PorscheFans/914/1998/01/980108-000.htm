May I clarify something. As the owner of a latemodel 914 2.0 I have made
note that there is some confusion about the injectors for these cars.
The injectors are green, like the earlier 2.0 injectors, but only
visually different in that the plastic molding at the top of the
injector has a center bar that extends almost all the way to the end of
the injector. They also cost more than the earlier style. I wanted to
buy four new injectors for my car at one point in desperation to solve
some fuel injection problems (and the irritating fact that I was running
two early and two late injectors) so my father and I looked at the Bosch
specs for both the early and the late. We didn't see any real
difference. Why they changed the part numbers I don't know. Maybe the
extra plastic material on top better prevents leaks? Anyone have any
info on this one? Anyway, the only color injectors used for D-jectronic
914s were yellow for the 1.7 and green for the 2.0. 1.8's used a
different kind of connection for their injectors and they, I think, were
grey. 912E's might have used blue injectors for their L-jectronic
systems.
