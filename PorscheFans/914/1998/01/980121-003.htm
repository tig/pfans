I have the kit from Performance Products. It's easy to install, by
cutting the bottom off the stock shifter and then epoxying that into the
replacement part from the kit. The price was around $35, if I remember
correctly.
You may need to re-adjust the shift linkage between the seats when
you're done to make sure that 2nd/3rd are up against the spring
pressure.
I think Automotion make a kit that replaces the entire shift lever, for
somewhere under $100.

I have the kit from Tweeks which is the same one from Automotion installed
in my  75 911 and could not be happier with it.  Good quality, easy to
install, lasted well. Have not had a chance to install it in my 14 yet as
my son has borrowed the car and is stationed 500 miles away.  When and if I
get the said vehicle back I plan on putting the same kit in forthwith. 
Have heard some bad comments on the cut off and glue on kit.  They seem to
have a nasty failure rate, at least in 911's.
