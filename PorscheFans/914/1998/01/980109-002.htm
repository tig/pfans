HOT, really HOT.

According to the "how to hotrod your VW" book, VW doesn't have any numbers
on head temps, but Chevy has some for the Carvair. The book quotes Corvair
temps as something like 375F is normal, 450F for high speed cruising, and
500something sets off an alarm. The Corvairs had a warning switch in the
head set to something like 550F. This is all from memory, so I could be off
by a bit.

 I was on Jon Lowe's excellent gt web site yesterday and I noticed a detail
 in one of the many pictures that piqued my interest. On my car, in the rear
 part of the front wheel wells, there's a vertical pinch weld seam. Mine is
 exposed such that water can get into the joint. When I saw that, I thought
 that it was pretty stupid to leave an exposed pinch weld like that right in
 the spray from the front tire, so I ordered some U channel strip from
 Pegasus Racing to put over it. Well, guess what I saw in one of the detail
 pictures of one of the GT's?? The same damn seam *with* some of that U
 channel stuff protecting it!! So, my question is: is this U channel covering
 for that seam an OEM item, or was it added by the factory just for GT's??? >>

It is not standard.  Most 914's simply have seam sealer slopped over the joint
prior to paint.  I never noticed that cover before you pointed it out.

 I want to know from those that have done this successfully whether they
 replaced the bolts and if so, what grade bolt did they use? The rebuild kits
 I have include several O rings, presumably for the internal passage(s) and
 other uses. I can get grade 10 bolts (150,000 psi) and nyloc nuts in metric,
 but nothing higher. (well, I can get grade 12.4 bolts (176,000 psi) but no
 nuts) Does anyone know what the torque spec is for those bolts?? And is
 there a particular pattern for torquing them down (like head bolts)?? >>

Look at an early 911 parts manual and get bolts for an early T (like 69-71)
that don't have vented rear brakes.  They have the bolts and nuts you need in
there.
