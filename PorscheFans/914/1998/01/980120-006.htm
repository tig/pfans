	I found that my 12mm 1/4" drive Craftsman works fine with a 6"
straight extension.  My only problem is on one stud that is either longer
than the rest, or has backed out some--the socket bottoms out!  Luckily,
this is on an inside-rear stud which is easy to access.  (12mm 1/4" drive
DEEP socket is next on the shopping list!)
	This is on SSI exchangers, by the way.  If I remember correctly,
the 3" extension worked but was a pain with my stock exchangers--that was
why I bought the 6" one.  The "socket" at the end of the extension (the
thick part) got in the way...
	I assume that you've removed all the under-engine ducting?  Some
of the nuts are impossible with it in place.
