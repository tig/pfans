     This message is specifically directed to the 914/6 conversion crowd on 
     the list and anyone who has experimented with Catalytic Converters.
     
       Has anyone successfully equipped their 914/6 with catalytic 
     converters?  (by successfully, I mean that they worked correctly and 
     allowed you to pass CA emissions)  My situation is such that I must 
     install them for the particular combo of engine and model year of car 
     I have.
     
     1)  what cats did you use?  (brand, type, diameter, length)
     2)  what temperature does the exhaust need to be to "light" off those
         respective catalysts?
     3)  where three exhaust tubes come together into one, how far was the 
         cat mounted from this junction in terms of flow path?
     
     4) does anyone have EVIDENCE that insulating Bursch headers with 
        fiberglass tape will in any way 'cause head failure from high 
        conducted temps?
     
     If I can't lick this issue, I will need to sell the car, and buy a '73
     since the new emissions laws in CA allow '73 and older an inspection 
     exemption.
     
     thanks
