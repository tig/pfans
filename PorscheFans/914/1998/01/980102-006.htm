	HP is simply (torque * RPM) * a constant.  (The constant is
just to get the units that you want.)  So, increasing your torque
at a given RPM will increase your power *at that RPM*.
	Going against that is the fact that airflow is a very tricky
thing.
	It turns out that many of the modifications that you can make
to an engine to get air into it when it is spinning quickly mess up
the lower-speed airflow.  Example:  Shorter, wider tubes flow air
more efficiently at high RPMs, while longer, narrower tubes flow
better at lower RPMs.
	Even if you lose torque over most of the RPM range, as long
as you have *some* at fairly-high RPMs, you can have high HP numbers.
This is why Torque and Power numbers don't mean quite as much as the
*shape* of the power curve.  For some motors, you will find people
talking about a "wide power band", which means that the motor makes
reasonable power over a wide range of RPMs.  Others are "rev-happy",
and you have to keep shifting to keep the RPMs up where the motor has
some power.

	Some changes you can make will increase torque across the
whole range of RPMs.  The one that springs to mind:  Changing the
compression ratio.  That will net you both peak torque *and* peak HP,
and won't change the shape of the power curve much.

	Most of this stuff I've learned from the Pfiles/Pfans lists.
I'm sure there are lots of books (and lots of listmembers!) that can
tell you more info, in better detail.  I thought I had the message
"Torque and HP: A Primer (long!)" saved away somewhere, but I can't
find it now.   8^(
