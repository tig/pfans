Nick,

Couple of points to remember:

This gizmo fits between the trailing arm mount and the frame. (Where
the adjustment shims go.)  You'll want to make ABSOLUTELY sure that
it's nice and flush in there.

Spend the time to drill some weld holes in the side of the stiffener
where it will hit the old inner rocker.  Align the holes with the
high spots; this will be obvious when you start fitting it in.

You may have to shorten them just a touch too.

It took about 2 hours/side to get them to fit perfectly, and ready
to weld.  I tend to be kind of fussy.
