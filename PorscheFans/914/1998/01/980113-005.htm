With all this talk about rustoration, I will let you in on my story....  
                                                                         
                                                                 I have
the same problem as we all seem to have and that is the dreaded RUST. I
own a '73 2.0ltr that is a great car mechanically, but the rust is going
to be the straw that broke this camel's back! (even tried to sell my
buddy) I have been getting advise over the past few years from various
sources (PCA Alan Caldwell, this list, Doc n Cy's, Parts Werks of
Chicago, etc..) and to be honest with you I really think this is a
project best left to an expert with the proper knowledge and equipment.
 
While living in the Cincinnati area, I could not find anyone who would
even attempt to look at the car, so I was determined to do it myself.
Save money and hell, I do know how to weld. Little did I know about the
warping, twisting, etc Thanks to Alan, saved me a lot of headaches and
money in the long run. 
.. 
I have since moved to the Pensacola Florida area and have made contact
with a 914 expert. Upon arrival at his "shop"(a little rough on the
outside), I noticed a bunch (I mean a bunch 10-20) of 914's in the back
yard. Going inside, he had a '73 that he was converting to a six, flares
and all, 3 on various racks and jigs getting repaired, and in back a
total rust bucket that was on getting worked on. 
The man had it all. When I get the car down here (yes, it is still in
storage in Cincinnati) I will be bringing it to him to work on. I showed
him pictures and got a rough quote of $1500 (parts and labor) for my rust
problems (inner rockers, rear floor pan, seat belt anchor points) and I
feel that if he comes out 10-20% higher in the end it will be worth it.
We'll see.

Bottom line, if you can afford it, let the expert do it. Safety is a
common goal among us all (ie. brazing?? yeah right!). Oh the address and
phone number for Smitty:

Smitty's Restoration and Custom Paint
3329 Andrew Ave. 
Pensacola, Fl 32505
850-432-2600

By the way, he tells me that for years his business used the Porsche name
(Smitty's Porsche Restoration) and finally got busted for it by a local
business competitor (dealer). 

                                                             Jim Appello

PS - I have no ties legally or otherwise to the above mentioned. 
PSS - I do have pictures for the door jigs from Alan Caldwell (PCA 914
expert) if anyone is interested.
