Hey rustorers,
I never had much luck with 'weld through' primers, but then
maybe 3M has come up with a formula that does work. (I'm skeptical)

Those scotch-brite cookies (on a steek) to rust bust
and paint remove work fine on paint and smooth metal, but
for rust pitted steel, they dont get out the specks that can
pollute your welds.  Sand blasting works far better, but
as others have pointed out, the sand gets into everything
and is difficult to control.  Not a good idear unless you are
working on a totally stripped car.  There is a tool (and you
knew there had to be) that looks like a garden hose pesticide
sprayer that comes with interchangeable rubber tips.
This weapon recycles the grit as you blast while holding the
business end against the spot you want to clean.  The theory
is that the rubber tip contains the blast and redirects it to the
grit reservoir while you happily shotgun away.  All you need is
air pressure@CFM since it is a 'suction' type blaster.  These
generally use carbide grit and can blow a hole in a rust-thinned
panel (so go easy there, gridley).

It's been a few years since I have been inside a longitudinal. .
I did a total rustore on a '73 car, and a partial on a '76.
 -this is not a job for the weak at heart.  Its a bitch to complete.
The area around the jack mount and rearward is pretty much
where the whole car ties together.  If the longitudinal inner is
terribly involved with rust -gack! there is multiple layers of steel
panels behind that and if those are eaten you have got a hell of
a job to make that right again.  The factory manual refers to a
'jig' that fits in the doorway (door removed) to ensure body
dimensions.  I dont recall if there were numerical dimensions
to construct the jig, but I would highly recommend using the
jig in place of the doors (or tack-weld the doors to the body).
  I did both side longs on my '73 and one inner (batt side) using
the doors as (unwelded) jigs, and 1/2" x 3" x 4Ft. bar stock
 -edgewise to keep the body strait and still wound up with a
warped body so bad that the damn doors wont close.
 -but eyhaa, she's solid!    The problem is that as your
welds cool, the contractive 'pull' is sooo great that the body
wants to fold up (or down).  Oh yeah, and I had the body mounted
on a 'rotisserie'. . .baste me with mouse turd broth.  I was pretty
serious about this at the time, and I still screwed it up.  The roto
allowed me to sit on it and spin; I even went to extreme lengths
in cutting open the body to allow access to the area just below
the firewall/battery box to cut, replace, weld patch.  Access to
this area is THE worst.  The stinger on most MIGs is too bulky
to get the angle AND see what you are doing. . .my stinger is 1/2
the size you get with the Lincoln migger (I've got a british SIP
from JC whitney).
This has gotten long already, I think some of you would like to
see and hear more in specifics than in gloss detail.  I still have
all of the pencil drawings and dimensions and photos I used to hack the
job, if interested shoot me email and if time permits, I will attempt
to offer what I have.  Mike C. has been asking me to upload my
past posts of minute-by minute of the work. . .eesh if you'all think
this would be good, yell at me.  It was a rather hairy experience
that had a sad ending.  Anybody wanna buy a rotisserie?
