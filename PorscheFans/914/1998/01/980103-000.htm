Jeff,
    I had to put a replacement panel in my car just as you've described.
Don't cut the boxy looking cross member.  That's the transmission mounting
point.  There's more than enough strength in that part to brace the trunk.
I cut out the rusty section then trimmed the new panel to fit.  We wire
brushed all the contact areas and tack welded the thing in place.  Once we
liked the look of everything, we welded a bead around the perimeter of the
panel.  There's a heat shield on the bottom of the rear panel.  I put a
header on my car, so I didn't worry about putting the shield back on. AA
sells some authentic looking goop that covers the welds inside the trunk.  I
used an undercoating product on the bottom of the panel.

    Budget about 3 hours work.

Regards,
DC
'75 914 2.0L
