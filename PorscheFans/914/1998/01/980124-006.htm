"Jeff,

You dealt with a person in a book of few.
Ralph Ricks, A genuine 10."

Naaaah...
anyone that's into Franklins, old Ford Ts, Bellancas and drives a 914 as
"generic transportation" is at least a 15.

This guy went out way of his way to come out to my house (out in the middle
of the Mojave) and help with my sensor problem on my 2.0ltr.  We discovered
then that I was also running off the battery - no voltage regulator. So we
fixed all that...  Truly nice guy - very unselfish.

Rickydik-You need to come back up and check out my recently acquired (and
unrestored)'36 Cord Westchester...With that flathead Lycoming V-8, it hums.
You'll love it.  Also picked up a '37 Willys Coupe, original & complete
with flathead 4, to keep it and my p-cars company.  It's a driver too. so
c'mon up.

As for the rest of you...if you're ever out in this desolate area for
whatever reason, stop in and take a break.

cheers
Thom Kuby
