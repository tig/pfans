To whomever had the problem with front end shake...

I agree the tire guys aren't always careful with the spin balance.
They sometimes want to get it just 'close enough'. I usually hang
around and buddy up while they do it to emphasize it's important
to me. I also put the wheels back on (ask first), and insist on
doing the final torque (yeah, I take my torque wrench with me).

There's a shop here in Austin that specializes in spin balancing on the car.
They'll shave the tire to get it exactly round and take extra care
with the final spin balance. They'll also spin the tire on the car
to look for problems and check the final result. Costs a little more
but worth it on tire/wheel that seems to have a problem. You might
check around for someone that can do this. This service is pretty rare.

As suggested, make sure the wheel is not bent (while on the balancer).
Tire may also be bad (belt shifted, bubble, etc.) so ask them 
to check for that too.

One mechanic told me that worn shocks can cause shakes (even
ambient temperature to a degree with certain shocks!). Also get
your front end components checked on the rack.

Finally, I've noticed I have to be extra careful with 1 Fuchs alloy
when torquing it to the hub else it's not 'centered'. With the car
lifted and the wheel spinning, you can see it wobble around the
center axis of the hub. Anyone know why this might be? I can't see
any problem with the hub, wheel bolts are correct size, torqued to 97 ft-lbs,
and no visible wear on the wheel stud holes.

I'm not an expert, just some observations...

Alan B  76 (#369) 914 2.0

PS. I'm running 185 70 HR 15 Nittos at present. They seem to be a
pretty good budget tire, with little to no road noise. I plan to
upgrade to 195 65 VR 15 Yokohamas soon.
