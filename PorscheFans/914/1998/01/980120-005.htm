Does anyone know when they changed from the glass faced gauges to the
plastic faced gauges?  Just curious.  My later plastic face gauges also
have a single blinker indicator, while my earlier gauges had two
separate indicators.  I used the later set because of the condition and
150 MPH speedo, but the wiring in the blinker circuit is different
somewhere in the cars wiring.



I'd also like to know if anyone has ever figured out this circuit and
      changed it back.  When I was cleaning up all the contacts on my 73 I
      noticed that there are 2 separate bulbs for the two turn indicators
      in the tach but they both flash.  I've been told this is normal for
      the car, haven't figured out this part of the wiring diagram yet.



Anyone done so and is there an easy way to switch the wiring to make the
      indicators flash separately?
