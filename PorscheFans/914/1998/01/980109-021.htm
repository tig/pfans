My comment there was intended to be a little tounge-in-cheeck (I had my
coffee :), but yes, titanium is not as ductile as stainless or carbon
steel. And as such will crack rather than bend or deform when
overstressed. But that limit is much higher than any steel and it's also
lighter. Yes, structurally, I'd love to have titanium valves. But
financially I incapable, and thermally I'm questionable. At 11 degrees
outside right now, I'm past just questionable. Brrr...

Bummer. I may still have to go out to the race on Sunday. As I'm teh
even safety steward, and none of the alternates have yet to speak up. I
don't wanna go if I can't drive my 914. :(
