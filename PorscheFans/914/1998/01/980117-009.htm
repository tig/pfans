I've been thinking of building a auto 914 for my lady friend. (she loves my
914 but has to have a auto trans)  so I've begun a 73 1.8 for her.  Now its
time to think about the trans.  At the Detroit Auto Show (not the best show
they've had IMHO)  I was checking out the Audi trans. they had on display. 
Looks like it would work in the rear of a 914.  .
A complete Audi engine and trans swap looks quite do able.  None of the
Audi engines look all that shall I say sexy.  Nice yes but not the most
bang for the buck as it were.
Though if the Audi is "buildable"  it would be quite acceptable.
Any Ideas on the Audi swap..   The lady doesn't need all that much power
but since I'm going to do it I want a bit of flair.  (I think its called
posing).
I suppose a Porsche auto would work, I've just never been real impressed
with them.  Am I missing something?
I've rambled on long enough.  Any ideas along this line will be really
apreciated.
thanks 

Joe Davis
