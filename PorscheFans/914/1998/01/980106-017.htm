> Anyone using antique plates on their 914?

I hadn't considered this as an option for my 914 for two reasons:

- I would have to *drive* mine to an inspection station within 7 days
after registration (definitely against the laws of physics at this
time);

- With all the *new* parts I've had to install, mine probably wouldn't
qualify as an *antique* car, anyway.

Anyway, should I consider it - here are the guidelines for NH:
The car must be 20 years old;
It is registered (and insured) for "occasional recreational" use - not a
"daily driver".

I think these might vary state to state, so you might want to check.
Also, the tax rate at the annual registration is reduced. And yes, up
here, the plates are good for either the life of the car or the owner -
which ever comes first :-)

Best,
John Dunkle
