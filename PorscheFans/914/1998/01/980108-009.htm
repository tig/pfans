If you only have a few holes near the firewall, why go to all of the trouble
of replacing the entire floor? It's relatively simple to cut out the rotten
metal and weld in new stuff. Besides all of the work required in replacing
the floor, you run the risk of warping the car. To prevent warping, you will
have to weld in braces *before* removing the floor. It's just so much more
work that doesn't seem necessary in your case. I would say the floor needed
replacing when the seat falls out or the occupants feet touch the ground,
not for a couple of holes near the firwall.
