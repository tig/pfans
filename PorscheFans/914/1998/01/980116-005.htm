I have the Kerry Hunter unit on my J-Racer and I can only say:

1.	Kerry was a dream to work with, he gave out more info than you could
ever ask for.
2.	The Headers gave me a significant change in the power band., and
solid top end improvement.
3.	I got the 4" supertrap and found that I could "tune" the powerband
by adding or subtracting plates.
4.	After 3 years the headers have held up very well, and I recommend
them highly


PS: I have used other headers on my '14 and these were the best I have used,
I have seen the ones that come from GT racing and they look very good also.
