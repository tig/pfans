    I had similar problems with my '73 side-shifter transmission, with
other problems, like not coming out of gear, and grinding periodically.
What
cured it for me was a change to Swepco synthetic gear-lube.  You may
want to try it before adjusting things.  I know it sounds
strange, but it cleared up a bunch of sticking and grinding gear
annoyances.
Good stuff.

> 2.  How complex is it to convert a '72 rear shifter to a side shifter?

....
    This is often unnecessary.  Try replacing all of the wear-items
(bushings, etc.) in the shifter path.  This made a BIG difference
for my '71 tail-shifter;  it's now as good as my '73.  A well set
up tail shifter works fine, but they go out of adjustment much
more quickly.  .

                            Anand.
