  I would think that you are asking for an awful lot of work to fit
an Audi engine in a 914;  the radiator location problem alone for a
liquid-cooled engine conversion in a 914 has never been really neatly
solved, as far as I know.   Add to this the custom engine mounts,
sheet metal work, etc., etc., and you are in for quite a project.

   Also, some states will make your life miserable when you try to
register and smog a car with a major engine swap. 

   If I needed an automatic tranny in a 914, I'd hit the junkyard for
a VW Sport-O-Matic, and install it with the ring gear flipped to the
other side.   The gearbox should be a lot cheaper to buy, and the fit
should be a lot better.   You will still have some cut and try, but
not near as much as with the Audi setup, and another advantage is
that Porsche made one or two such cars as test marketing projects, so
you have the knowledge that it has been done once before.

   Just my $.02 worth.

					Good Luck,
                                                            Jim T.
