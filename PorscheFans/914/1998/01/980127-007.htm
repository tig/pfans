Funny you should ask. I've been researching EFI systems for about a year now.
There are quite a number of systems out there, and they vary greatly in
capabilities and versatility. There are simple systems that are more or less
bolt on EFI systems for a street car. And there are fully programble systems
for high performance applications.

I'm looking at the latter, the high performance application, for my race car.
A few systems have passed _my_ criteria, fully integrated ignition _and_ fuel
mapping. Haltech, Electromotive, Accel, and MoTec. Of these four, the MoTec is
by far the best system. It's also the most expensive, probably costing you
(the installer) about $4-5k for a complete system which includes all of the
neccessary sensors. Of the other three, there are differing oppinions, but I'm
leaning to the Accel. I know someone who is running the Electromotive, and it
is not the easiest system to utilize, It is plent capable, but programing is
not terribly easy, and the system is not the most robust. The Haltech I've
heard differing oppinions, some say it's great, some say it's not. The Accel
seems to be the only system of these three that doesn't have any real
negatives. I havn't heard anyone really rave about it either, but what I have
heard sounds pretty good. The Accel has a very straightforward and simple
programing interface and has pretty good resolution.

I havn't actually invested in any of these yet. Just so you don't start
thinkin that you can just go out and bolt up a modern FI package, they
_require_ programing. Most applications that we P-car types will find will
reqiure a laptop to interface with the brain, and a fair amount of data
logging time. Dyno time is always the best, but at about $100 per hour, it's
not the cheapest.

The approximate cost of these systems is about $750-$1k for the brain and a
few of the sensors. This is by no means all that is really needed for high
performance applications. A higher pressure uel pump, accurate regulator,
larger injectors, MAP sensor, O2 sensor, TPS sensor, and a small assortment of
various hardware. So it's not the cheaper way to go, but it is the way to get
the most power out of a stcok engine.
