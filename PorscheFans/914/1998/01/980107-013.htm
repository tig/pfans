If I'm following you correctly, you mention below that there's a difference
between "early" and "late" 2.0 injectors.  I'm looking at getting new ones
for my '76 2.0, and my current ones are green.  Did someone screw up and put
the wrong injectors in my engine?  What year (and what color) injectors are
recommended?

Thanks,

J.J. Slowik
