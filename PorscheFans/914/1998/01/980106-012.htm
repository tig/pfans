It doesn't do any good to have studed snow tires if your car is high
centered and can't get the tires to touch the ground. Actually it's
either a high cenetering problem or a submarining problem. With snow
this deep it'd be a problme with submarining under the snow. The snow
was so deep this morning..."how deep was it?". It was so deep that my
quattro with much more clearance than any 914 (and certainly mine) was
litteraly swimming in the snow. Kinda fun actually, just lock up the
differentials, plant the gas pedal, and try to keep the car pointed in
the right direction. I could feel the car just floating down the hill, a
little drift here and alot of drift there eieio. Yeehaa! FIA Rally here
I come!

But if the roads don't improve too much by sunday, I won't be racing the
CONIVOR this weekend. Bummer...
