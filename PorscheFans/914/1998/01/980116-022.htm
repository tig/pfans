Brake Rebuilders:

There has been lost of good information posted lately regarding brake
caliper rebuilding, and I'll add my $0.02.

Rear caliper kits are availible.  Just don't mess with the adjuster, other
than replacing the outer o-ring.  Use some never-seize on the metal plug
that covers the "inside adjuster" to make adjustments easier next time.

There is a product that is actually called "rubber grease."  You can get it
from your FLAPS.  You can also buy "brake assembly lube" which works the
same.

**caution** do NOT USE REGULAR GREASE.  The main problem with regular grease
and brake innards is that regular petroleum products will *kill* the rubber
parts, causing brake failure.  Not something you want to happen with your
brakes.

When rebuilding calipers, first, free the bleeder screws.  If they're stuck,
try a good penetrating oil, like liquid wrench, heat, etc.  They usually
come free when I hit the wrench with my hand.   A sharp blow is often what
it takes.  I do this with the caliper on the car.  Once the bleeder screw is
free, you can remove the brake line, and cap the line with the rubber cap
that covers the bleed screw.  This helps minimize fluid loss/moisture entry.
Freeing the bleeder screw now is an easy way to avoid _big_ dissapointment
later.

Before you split the calipers, thoroughly clean the outside with a wire
brush to loosen any rust, dirt, brake dust, etc.  Rinse with hot water.
Don't breathe the dust that you're making, it's brake dust, and hazardous to
your health.  Remember to clean the surfaces that the pad edges ride on.  I
use a flat screwdriver to scrape these clean.

Disassemble your calipers, and mask off the mating surfaces and piston
bores.  I use duct tape across the entire inside portion.  Clean and dry the
caliper halves, and shoot with your favorite primer and paint.  Most people
like to use red or black, but I'm a sucker for yellow calipers.  Get 2 or 3
coats on the outside half, the inside half doesn't matter as much.  While
they dry, you can prep the pistons, etc.

Clean the pistons carefully; scratches are not good.  I'm lazy and use a
wire wheel attached to my bench grinder, and *gently* clean off any rust.
Crocus cloth works best, but takes a bit more time.  Rinse with brake fluid.
Lube the seal-rings with brake fluid or a bit of rubber grease, install them
in the bore, then work the piston back into the bore.  If you use rubber
grease, it goes in much easier.  Try not to get brake fluid on your newly
painted calipers, because brake fluid eats paint.  If the piston doesn't
want to go back in, stop, pull out the o-ring, inspect the o-ring for "bite
marks" and try again.  I've seen sealing o-rings chewed up by
over-enthusiastic mechanics.

Last time I rebuilt calipers, I re-used the fluid-channel o-rings, but any
o-ring that fits with a bit of "squish" will work fine--your hardware store
can be much cheaper than your p-car dealer.  Bring your caliper halves, and
the old o-ring to size it.  Buy a bunch, they're cheap.  Then write down the
size, and post it to this list :))

When you're done, be sure to bleed the brakes, and to check for leaks.

cheers, Brian Ng
