"There are no stupid questions.  Only stupid answers."

The 914 "frame" has two square beams that run the length of the car.
They are under the doors, and connect the front and rear suspensions.

They go the long direction of the car, and are called the longitudinal
frame members.  (Side to side would be called lateral frame members.)

The outside of these is (yes) the inner rocker.  And yes, the hand
brake is bolted to the inside.  Oh, and the heater ducts run through
them.

The outer rocker is typically black.  I haven't seen a chrome one, but
I wouldn't be surprised by one.  I have seen them painted a contrasting
color.

The longitudinal support discussed earlier is an added piece to stiffen
the existing frame member.  They are added for extra stiffness, either
because rust had weakened the old one, or for racing.

(I'm stopping now, for fear I will start rambeling......)

Gary.
