I've heard straight pipes on a 914 and they hurt turn workers' ears.  Honestly,
it was a case of needing to put your fingers in until the car was off the
autocross course.  Nobody was favorably impressed, even though we were at an
abandoned airfield without noise "rules."  The car was MUCH louder than
Supertraps.  At the next event, the guy had mufflers.

On the other hand, my DeskTop Dyno program projects 12hp from removing mufflers
in favor of straight pipes.
