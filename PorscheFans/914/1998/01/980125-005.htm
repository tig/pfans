Assuming your car has never had one installed, it is a tricky procedure.I
did not do this on my car, but the story from my body guy is that it is a
pain. He spent hours getting things lined up correctly before welding the
reinforcements and the weld nuts in place. The bar has to be exactly
parallel with the suspension or you will get binding. Even if I could weld,
I would still leave it to a porsche specialist, since it is not a standard
installation as far as the rest of the automotive industry goes. You can
get the reinforcements from a dealer like Stoddard. These go on the inside
of the fender wells. The gas tank must come out for the bar mounting
hardware to be installed. Hope this helps.
