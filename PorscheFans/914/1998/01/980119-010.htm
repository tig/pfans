Just for those who haven't been to the area, some random info.

From LA  the fastest way up that I've found (depending on exactly where you
start, I start from Pasadena) is to take I5 up then take Hwy 46 (marked to
Paso Robles) across to Hwy 101 then up that.  Watch Hwy 46, basically 2
lane hwy. Higher accident rate so about half of it is a double fine zone
and heavily patrolled.

Laguna Seca is on Hwy 68 which runs from Salinas to Monterey.  Hwy 68 is
basically a 2 lane road in most spots.  There are also several parks and
housing communities up canyons along 68.  Therefore expect HEAVY traffic on
race days in the summer.  People will be coming from both Salinas and
Monterey directions.  There is usually heavy CHP presence because of the
windy road and higher than normal accident rate.

I use to live in Salinas.  Hwy 68 turns into Main St. when it hits the
first traffic lights at the city border.  This is the south side of town
which is the better area.  The east side of Salinas is the bad side with
the majority of gang activity.  Some of the north side of Salinas has
problems too.

The junction from Hwy 101 to Hwy 68 is not that clear unless they've
changed the signs lately.  The southmost exit from 101 to Salinas is
Airport Blvd.  The next one north of this is the one you want.  Depending
on the direction you are coming from it will say Sanborn Road and/or
Monterey Peninsula exit.  Take that.  Coming up from the south you take the
exit.  Make a left on the small street then a left onto Sanborn.  Coming
from the North you'll make a right  (this is a weird intersection, no right
turn on red allowed, cops watch this)  onto Sanborn.  Once on Sanborn if
you don't see an overpass over railroad tracks almost immediately you
turned the wrong way and are heading toward east side of town.

Stay on Sanborn.  Go straight through the next big intersection, the street
name chances to Blanco Rd.  This make a big sweeping curve to the righ
around Salinast, fields on your left, houses on the right. Follow this then
at the next big intersection make a left onto Main St.  This becomes Hwy 68
headed toward Monterey.

Don't know much about the RV situation around there.
