Hi everyone.

Well, it started happening about a month ago. Whenever I started my car
moving, I heard (and felt) a "clunk" coming from the right side of my
car. I naturally assumed that a CV joint was on the way out, and started
pricing parts, etc.
That was clue no. 1.

Then something a little unusual happened. I was driving my 914 on a
smooth, newly surfaced road (unusual in itself in L.A.), when I felt a
bump like I had driven over something. When I looked in the rear view
mirror, something round and a couple of inches accross was rolling
towards the gutter.
Clue no. 2.

As I shifted down for the next corner, my gear shift felt stiff and
heavy.
That was clue no. 3.

Piture a dim light bulb over my head, and I'm thinking "could that have
been the.. no, couldn't be".

I was a couple of blocks from home, so I kept going, and when I got
there and looked under the car, and what do I see? My engine mount on
the driver's side is hanging a couple of inches below the car (and that
puts it about 2" above the road!) and the Allen bolt and the engine
mount plate are gone!
The weight of the engine was sitting on the shift linkage!

I went for a walk and found the bolt and plate (yes, that's what I had
driven over), and the nylock nut and washer were still right where they
belonged.

The funny thing though, is that since I rebuilt my engine in August '95,
I've put 25,000 miles on it, including a trip from Los Angeles to Dallas
and back. So I guess the bolt just worked it's way loose. And yes, I  re
tourqed every nut and bolt I could find afterwards!!!

See ya,
Rick.
