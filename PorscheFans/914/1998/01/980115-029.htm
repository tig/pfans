I missed the original post, but my experiences with a Bursch
(steelpack?) for my 2.0 were similarl to those of Philip Wharton, except
that the paint quickly departed from the collector pipes. I finally
painted on that stainless-look header paint from Eastwood and had pretty
good results, considering I didn't sandblast. My advice is to sandblast
and have a really good high-temp coating applied before you install it.

The Bursch collector also makes it easy to install a single O2 sensor
(instead of two as required by the stock set up) for an air/fuel ratio
meter. My unit was the non-catalyst type and I have found that the
muffler portion can be easily upgraded to a number of standard
aftermarket 2.25" performance mufflers, like the Walker TurboMax or
whatever. In short, I like it.

Yes, I had a friend that did it twice.  Have to either get a reverse cam or
flip the ring gear because the engine runs in the reverse direction.

He did it twice because the first one burned to the ground.  He had triple
throat webers on it and they caught fire.  He did it again, it also burned to
the ground, in the same location, right after he had been to the same place to
buy something! He then gave up and bought a 914/6!

And yes, the story is real!
