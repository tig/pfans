I've had the pleasure of attempting to install fiberglass GT fender
flares from Automotion.  I don't know who their supplier is, but
those flares were crap.  The contour of the curve didn't resemble
a 914 at all.  To add even more excitement, the edge of the flare
that's supposed to go against the car was bent "out" - pointing
away from the car.

A careful examination of the flares has led me to believe they
were actually made this way - not victims of warping in transport.
It appears someone made a mold from an existing car and they
just filled it up with gelcoat and fiberglass.

This is where the Chalon parts shine in comparison....instead of
mearly slapping the 'glass on top of the car, the Chalon parts
actually have a "lip" made in the flares which allow the flares to
go below the cut away fender so the top of the flare is at the same
height as the metal bodywork on the car.

The Chalon parts are assembled as follows:

1) templates are taped to the car and you cut away the excess
metal with a jigsaw
2) pound the edges of the metal flat
3) sand off all paint and undercoating a few inches from the edges
4) clamp the flare into place and drill a pile of holes 1" apart
the 1st hole is 1/8", the next 3/16", then repeat for the entire
length of the flare
5) remove fender and mix up some industrial marine epoxy (you'll
need to add some powdered fiberglass to thicken up the mixture)
6) apply the epoxy to the fender and slide it into place - securing
with sheet metal screws in the 1/8" holes
7) now get a forearm workout by filling the 3/16" holes with
pop rivets
8) wait at least a day for the epoxy to cure ROCK HARD (it might
take longer depending on your climate, etc)
9) remove screws and drill out pop rivets
10) fill in holes with a high-quality filler (I chose fiberglass filler
for strength and water-tightness)
11) blend in the flare to the car with bondo
12) sand, fill, sand, fill, sand, fill, sand and paint

When I was attempting to install the GT flares with their funky
curve that didn't match my car, I had to slowly tighten the screws
over a 10 day period to slowly "warp" the fender into position.
A heat gun helped only a little bit.  If you try to tighten the screws
too much too soon, you'll crack the flare.

One more tip....only use the best drill bits you can find.  Get the
titanium coated split-point drill bits.  If you don't want to spend
the extra buck, you'll destroy your flares trying to drill through
them and into the curved surface of the car....cheap HSS drill
bits will wander all over the place - especially on a curved fender.

Good luck!
