Hi Josh!

  You asked;

consider to

   ... nor does anyone else... I wrote to the Porsche factory on this
question, got refered to VW, and finally gave up.   I have one data
point for you; please bear in mind that it is ONLY ONE point... not
much to base a theory on, but here goes:

  I also have the VDO temp gauge and sensor, with the sensor mounted
under the Temp Sensor II thermistor for the fuel injection on the
head near cylinder # 3.  I have never calibrated the gauge; I have no
other corroborative evidence... but mine runs at about 350 degrees F
under normal circumstances.   It gets a wee bit hotter than that here
in the desert in the summertime, with 100+ degree F ambient air, but
not much... I don't believe that I've ever seen 370 degrees.  
Therefore, I would say that about 350 is somewhere near normal... say
cookie-baking temperature.

   What else I have collected in my researches, I reproduce below.

RD Rick:  
The overtemp light on the Corvair trips at 450 F.  It is bolted in
one corner of the head.

From conversations with an aircraft owner and pilot:
 The Lycoming (or maybe Continental, I forget which) aircraft engine
redline is 475 F for the normally aspirated version, and 500 F for
the turbocharged version.

 Please find reproduced below the text of a reply by Porsche in 
Stutgart to a query that I sent them regarding the 
cylinder head temperature parameters for a 914.  Specifically, I
asked for the normal operating range and the never-exceed
temperatures.  I 
didn't exactly get what I asked for;  I think that you will find the
third paragraph especially interesting / amusing.

CYLINDER HEAD TEMPERATURE PARAMETERS OF PORSCHE 
914

Dear Mr. Thorusen,

During the model year 1970 up to model year 1976 we built the 
vehicles of the type 914 in cooperation with the Volkswagen AG.

In those years we equipped the four cylinder vehicles with engines 
made by Volkswagen and the six cylinder vehicles with engines made 
by Porsche.

Since we never had any problems concerning extended cylinder head 
temperature we did not find necessary to publish technical data to
this topic in our workshop manual.

For checking the temperature sensor II, which is situated close to
the spark plug for the 3rd. cylinder, you will have to work in the
following procedure:

Disconnect plug, connect ohmmeter between temperature sensor II 
and ground, read indication.

Nominal value:   0.5 - 2.5 kilohms (very temperature sensitive, value
decreases with increasing temperature).

Guide value:    approx. 2.5 kilohms when engine temperature is 
approx. 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).

Replace unit if necessary.


Kind regards,

Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche

  You now know as much as I do;  I understand that one of our
resident Physicists was going to instrument his engine with lab grade
thermocouples, and report the results.   I can hardly wait.

					Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
