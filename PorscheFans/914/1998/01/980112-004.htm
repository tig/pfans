Hold on a minute!  I've heard too many people recommend 205/60's to leave them
out of the consensus.  They fit fine under my stock fenders, but I do have 14"
rims.  With the smaller rims, the selection is somewhat smaller, and the only
V rated Yoko was the AVS-I.  I am very happy with the way my tires feel, and
as far as road noise, the car is loud enough that it's not really an issue.
