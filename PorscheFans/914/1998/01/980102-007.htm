I sort of agree with Cory.  I have the book from when I first got into the
VW's and built an engine for my Thing.  I'd say it has some interesting
info if you've got the extra $ to spend on the book.  The head porting info
is nice but the specific info like on carbs etc. is very dated.

On the VW type 1's I might try doing my own head rebuilds and mild porting,
the parts are common and relatively cheap. No so for the type 4 914
engines.   Heads are too expensive for me to risk things myself, I'll be
sending my 2L heads to Mark Stephens when I get to the engine pull stage.

I have the VW hot rod book and would not suggest spending your money on
it.  The book was published in 1970!
