Does anyone know if the engines had seals around the intake manifolds as they
pass through the sheet metal? My car doesn't have them but I noticed that the
picture of the engine in the new 914 book by Bruce Long seems to show them. I
can't find them listed in any of the catalogs however.

Edgar: To obtain the certificate you must write PCNA a letter and provide the
vin #, year built etc. I think the charge was $35.00 and it took about a month
to receive from Germany.I enclosed my bill of sale. I don't have PCNA's
address here at the office but it is in Excellence. If you can't find it send
me an e-mail and I will get back to you this weekend.
