From my personal experience I can not recommend purchasing a car from
Automobile Atlanta.  I purchased a steel flaired 73 2.0 with some upgrades 
for
$14000 primarily on the reputation of AA.  This car had rust that shouldn't
have been in a car of this price range, and it was NOT an original 2.0 but a
converted 1.7. Even if  your friend wanted to, I would doubt if he be able 
to
purchase a '73-'74 2.0 from AA or anywhere for 5K.  The last time I was at 
AA
and looked a cars like this it was more like $9500 or  more.  Realisically 
the
preferred 2.0's are more like $7500 in the east and mid west, and cheaper in
CA.  If your friend has plenty of time, I'd recommend checking out several
cars and plan to do some traveling.

I full agree with PK on this note.  I purchased a 74 2.0 from AA for $4k.  
It was a bit rough around the edges and was converted from a 1.8 some time 
in it's life.  Though I may have gotten what a paid for, better deals can be 
had in California where the market is much larger than the mid west.  For me 
it was a matter of cost traveling from Chicago to Atlanta or California in 
search for a decent 914.  In the end the total cost may have been the same 
(buying parts vs paying more for travel expenses).  My only regret is I 
could have been driving the 914 more than fixing it.  Try Otto,s in Cal.  
For a few dollars more your buddy may find a car that he would be much 
happier with.
