Justin and Mike

To the best that I can tell, #10 should also be a 25A fuse.  Although I did not
see a specific listing, two things lead me to belive this:

1. In Haynes (p173) illustrates all fuses except #8, #10, and #12 as plain
rectangles - #8, #10, and #12 are illustrated as filled rectangles.  This
indicates to me that #8, #10, #12 have the same rating, but no values are
specifically given.  This diagram also happens to be from a '74 but should be
the same as a '73.

2. An 8 amp fuse for both fog (aux) lights seems a little under-rated.  A 8A
fuse is only good for up to 96 watts, and each of the fog lights is rated at 55
watts (110 watts total).

Supposedly the correct fuse ratings are listed on the fuse cover, but I don't
remember seeing them there, and I didn't have a chance to look for it there.
 I'll check tonight and see what I find.

Anyway, if you don't have the fog lights, don't worry about it.  The only
reason I noticed this is because I just bought a fog light setup and was
studying the wiring diagram last night.

This brings up a question of mine.  As far as the fog lights go, the wiring is
a bit confusing. I know that the fog lights are tied to the headlight operation
and I believe that they may be tied to the high/low beam state also.  Do the
fogs go off/on depending on whether the headlights are on high or low beam
(assuming the fog light switch is turned on of course).  Will the fogs turn on
when only the parking lights are on without the headlights?  If someone can
fill me in it would help me understand the wiring.

Thanks!
