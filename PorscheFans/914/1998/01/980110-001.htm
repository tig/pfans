I called tech line about using thier products in our VW air cooled motors,
and they said go for it! Summit Racing sells the stuff. You need some kind
of spraying device to apply it, since you want it real smooth so you can
polish it after baking it in an oven. There are 2 kinds, one each for
ferrous and non-ferrous metals. What to do about the steel valve seats in
an aluminum head? I asked them and they said that their product can be
wiped off easily before baking, so the procedure would be to spray the
combustion chamber and exhaust ports, then wipe off the valve seats, then
maybe brush a little ferrous stuff on the the seats, then bake. Of course,
you want to do the front and back and part of the stem of the exhaust
valve, and the face of the intake valve.

BTW, I think I'm gonna get a DIY anodizing kit and anodize both the heads
and the aluminum valve covers flat black. I figured out how to keep the
anodizing solution out of the interior parts of the head.
