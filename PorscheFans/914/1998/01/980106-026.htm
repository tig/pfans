Hi gang,

My job has kept me away from the 914 list for many
many months.  :-(  I thought I'd check the last few digests
and came across the following from Brian Mifsud.  Here's
what I've experienced with my 3.0 SC 914-6 conversion:

     1) Emissions system: will it pass in your state?

The carbs on my 3.0 have kept my car in the garage
for over a year.  One of these days I'll toss on the original
CIS FI setup so I can actually drive my car again.
     
     2) Rear Suspension - pre '73 914/4 hubs drilled to the 5 lug
pattern 

[snip]  I've always been scared of drilling out hubs....maybe I'm
paranoid.  Whatever....I went the early 911 hubs and stub axles
route for the rear.  Works great.

     Springs also need to be upgraded since you are 
     carrying more weight with the 6 and have a significantly higher
power 
     range to play with.  

Definitely.  I'm using 185lb springs with Koni reds.  Works great with
the extra weight of the 3.0 engine and 915 tranny.  My previous 914-6
was with a 2.4 case and 914 tranny.  Troutman 145lb springs and Boge
sport shocks worked well.
     
     3) Rear Brakes - the "nicest" setup is to have genuine 914/6 rear 
     calipers and rotors. It is clean and retains your parking brake.

There's another option....with the 911 hubs I simply bolted on a stock
914-6 rear rotor.  Some slight clearancing of the caliper was required
to eliminate some rubbing....or you could turn down the diameter of
the 914-6 rotor a little so you can use the stock 914-4 calipers.  For
a street/autox car I didn't think I had to worry about upgrading the
quality of the rear brakes that much when I had other ways of stopping
the car faster....911S alloy calipers up front with 225/50 rubber at all
four corners.  This car stops incredibly fast!!!
     
     4) Oiling System - stock OEM 914/6 oil tank is cleanest.  Aux. Oil 
     cooler (especially in nose of car) is highly desireable.

I have the OEM tank and prefer it for a street car.  It doesn't muck up
the trunks.

Aux cooler is good...if required.  Depends on where you live and what
conditions you subject your car to.  I haven't needed a cooler - the oil
temps haven't been past 200.  Living in Canada has its benefits!!!  :-)
     
     5) Engine - OEM sheetmetal most desireable, (will look cleanest).  
     Mounting system, many will argue that the Quick-Six style is prone
to 
     breakage and that the engine-bulkhead mount style of the OEM 914/6
is 
     the only way to go.  I believe a Quick-Six style can be made to
work, 
     you just need a Bigger tube!

I've got a reinforced quick-6 style.  Very beefy and has been proven
on the track.  I can sleep at night.
     
     6) Instrumentation - 914/6 gages cleanest, most expensive, 911
gages 
     will do the job very well, center console very desireable to 
     accomadate the necessary extra head temp. oil pressure, oil temp 
     gages.

Andrew Warren and some others have come up with a very nice
alternative....custom gages.  You can get custom "combo" gages
which can move the fuel gage back to the main instrument cluster.
I'll probably go this route when my car is street-legal again.
     
     7) Body, no changes needed, steel GT flares VERY nice, as well as 
     Steel or 'glass flared rocker panels.  Flares allow much more
rubber.

Fiberglass flares usually suck quality-wise.  Be prepared to spend many,
many hours "fitting" the flares to your car.....
     
     8) Wheels- pretty much your choice.

I chose 8x15 fuchs style with 225/50 tires on all corners.  My track
wheels are 8's and 9's with 225's and 245's.  Yes, I have flares.  Hence
my experience with "fitting" them...  :-(
     
     9) Transaxle - 916 conversion (915 converted to sideshift) nicest
and 
     most durable.  Allows usage of ALL 5 gears and thus most
flexibility 
     (see Vellios$$$$$$)  901 will do the job, again sideshift is the 
     ticket 1st gear however must be babied and in my book, makes it 
     impractical for a proper semi-bulletproof STREET car.  914/6 racers
     will argue that they never use 1st gear, this makes it a four speed
as 
     far as I am concerned however.  Recent Rebuild and limited slip
added 
     bonuses.
     
NO!!!  This is the one point where I must respectfully disagree with
Brian.
I've done the 915 conversion and most likely wouldn't do it again.  I
haven't
gone the whole Vellio$ route though....I'm using the Patrick Motorsports
cable shifter.  I haven't had the time to fully sort out the shifting,
but it
was far nicer with the modified 914-4 shift linkage when I had the
smaller
911 engine in the car with the stock 914 trans.
    
I know 2 people in my area with the full-blown Vellio$ 915 setup.  One
is
very happy and the other isn't so happy.  He's had some shifting
problems.

I can think of other places to blow $3500 - $4000.  Buying a stockpile
of disposable 914 side-shift trannys at $300 each sounds more appealing
to me.

Another data point:  I met a guy who had a 350 Chev in his 914 with the
stock 914 trans....it took him 3-4 years to break the trans.  Also
consider
that the 350 Chev puts out *WAY* more torque than any near-stock 911
engine.

By the way, Patrick Motorsports sells race-duty funky alloy CV joint
cages for all your 914-6 conversion needs.  Never used them, just
saw them in a flyer I got from them once upon a time.  If they work
as advertised then the last problem with using the 914 trans with a
large engine has just been solved.

Good luck!
