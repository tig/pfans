	My old 1.8 (Hi, Walker!) had an electrical pump.  It was mounted
onto the left-side support for the front cowl, more or less behind the
brake fluid reservoir.  It is possible that the gas tank had to be pulled
out to install it.  There was a switch installed under the dash to acti-
vate this pump.  Needless to say, the stock tubing through the steering
column had been disconnected.
	Another option might be to use a stock 914-6 washer tank.  Good
luck on finding one, BTW!  But they had the motor integral to the tank;
mounted in the bottom somewhere.  The cap was different, as no "inlet"
hose was needed.  I think the stock system used a dashboard button or
switch.
	You can, however, use the steering column lever to activate the
pump if you do some work.  Some cars (like my 2.0) have the "flick-wipe"
system installed, which activates the wipers for a couple of swipes if
you pull back on the washer lever.  You may be able to use this electrical
signal to switch on the pump as well.  It will require some dissecting of
the wiring to do so.  If your car does not have this built in, you may be
able to buy the switch--not sure.  You can probably find a commercial
microswitch to install yourself, if you don't mind running the extra wires.

	Three suggestions:  A friend of mine talks about "friction tape"
a lot--I guess this is a lot like "hockey tape", but without the adhesive.
I am not entirely sure how it stays on...  Supposedly this is a common
way of keeping wiring harnesses together.
	Another suggestion:  Shrink tubing.  It may be tough to get all
the wires through the tubing in reasonable shape, but since you can use
tubes larger than the final one will be, it should be easier than (say)
vinyl tubing.
	Third suggestion:  Vinyl tubing from the hardware store.  You can
slit it lengthwise and fit the wires in that way.  I don't know how well
it will hold up to gasoline fumes, though.

	Good luck!
