This came from the 924-944Porschefans.com page.  When I read it the first 
time I thought it was a real mechanical problem, until I read 
on.........I'll bet some of you fellow 'teeners have had the same 
problem..............HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
------------------------------------------------------------------
From: Ken Kroslowitz
I'm puzzled. Recently, I have been experiencing a loud, screeching noise 
emanating from the passenger seat area. Typically, sound occurs when 
encountering extreme lateral g-forces on either right, or left hand turns. 
Sounds are also emitted under extreme braking conditions. No problem when 
accellerating.
While there never seems to be enough traction, road grip is good.
Understeer is noticed on sharp turns, as well as chassis roll, and
'drifting' will eventually occur on long sweepers.

Additional symptoms:

Sound is only emitted when Girlfriend 1.0 is present.
Driver experiences extreme thrashing from Girlfriend 1.0 immediately
after screeching noise stops.

Question:

Has anyone else experienced this?
Why does it occur only with Girlfriend 1.0? Should I upgrade to 2.0?
Is this a problem?(period)
First person with the correct answer (i.e.-Girlfriend 2.0's phone
number, gets Girlfriend 1.0's phone number.)
944 NA (stands for Needs  A .....Turbo, 8 more valves, dual ignition,
etc.)
"Threshold braking is for lovers."

	The screeching you describe can be remedied by use of "100 MPH" tape. 
Apply liberally to the area that the screeching is coming from. Also a 
minor upgrade of Girlfriend 1.0 to 1.2 to remove unwanted movement during 
high G turns. Can't recommend going to 2.0 as faults that occur in 1.0 may 
not have been rectified by the factory.

Solution:  Tie a length of cord to passenger door release handle.  When 
sound occurs, carefully pull cord, then firmly push occupant out of car. 
Future occupants will learn of this procedure, and the noise will not 
recur.

Ken,
From Tech Supplement 6.9:
Screeching and thrashing are common problems with Girlfriend 1.0. 
There appears to be a manufacture defect so that there is early 
bearing seizure due to lack of lubrication. (whoa, going just a bit 
too far). Girlfriend 2.0, otherwise known as special Porsche Part 
number P-GF101172, however is, at the time this went to press, not 
available to the general public. Although if special Porsche Part 
number P-GF101172 were available to the general public PCNA would 
assess a license fee of $7000 per month for unlimited use. You may be 
advised however given your current financial situation to upgrade to 
special Porsche Part number P-GF101172 if you happen to locate one on 
the black market as Girlfriend 1.0, otherwise known as special 
Porsche Part number P-GF2817384 has been shown to have a severe mall 
dysfunction. As special Porsche Part number P-GF101172 is a dealer-
only item  no telephone number exists. In the meantime decrease 
lateral g-forces from 3.8 to 2.4 as per your Porsche-authorized 
Haynes manual.

Maybe Rox has a lead on a black-market Girlfriend 2.0?
