I was on Jon Lowe's excellent gt web site yesterday and I noticed a detail
in one of the many pictures that piqued my interest. On my car, in the rear
part of the front wheel wells, there's a vertical pinch weld seam. Mine is
exposed such that water can get into the joint. When I saw that, I thought
that it was pretty stupid to leave an exposed pinch weld like that right in
the spray from the front tire, so I ordered some U channel strip from
Pegasus Racing to put over it. Well, guess what I saw in one of the detail
pictures of one of the GT's?? The same damn seam *with* some of that U
channel stuff protecting it!! So, my question is: is this U channel covering
for that seam an OEM item, or was it added by the factory just for GT's???

The picture is 91613.jpg, in the 916 portion of the site.
