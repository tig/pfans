Hi Pfans!
The Porsche Factory Tour was incredible!!
We took the train into Stuttgart from Brussells 
and the S-bahn (tramrail) to Zuffenhausen.  Found 
a little hotel there and walked ~10 min to the 
Factory Museum.  At 1000 we were met by Johannes,
our guide.  We started in on the engine line.  One 
line was building the Boxster, 993 and 996 engines, 
there were several people working on that line. 
There was only one guy working on the other line...
that was the turbo line.  There are only two guys 
(1 on each shift) in the world who build all of the 
turbo engines for Porsche!!  The engineering of 
the plant alone is impressive.  The bodies are painted
in one building and are conveyed through an enclosed
"bridge" to the main assembly building.  There they 
receive all of the interior, glass, lighting, doors and bumpers.
And while that is going on, the drive train, brakes and 
suspension are being assembled and transported on
another rack/ conveyer.  The two meet up at a point
Johannes calls the "marrying" step.  The body is 
lifted as well as the running gear and they are bolted
together... another Porsche is born.  Boxster after 996
after 993 after turbo....destination... Italy...USA...New
Zealand...Germany... South Africa...and so on.  It was 
beautiful!!!  I gained a new respect for the engineers,
assemblers, and vehicles from PorscheHaus.  I like how
Johannes said it..."We build Porsches with our hands...
from our hearts and our minds."  Too cool.  If you ever
have the chance to see the factory by all means DO IT!!!
PCNA's Cheryl Whitaker, (702-348-3109) can help
with the details and answer questions.  
Later,
Mike M.
