        I've also been listening to this thread, and .02 more should
just about do it:
I'm running replacement SS valves on my 750CC air cooled '78 Triumph
Bonnie, and have been for about 10 years. Combined with a bronze guide
material, these show no detectable wear, and require minimum adjustment.
Some of you may recall that the Ford SOHC 427 race motor also was
originally supplied with sodium filled exhaust valves. Whenever one of
these motors is resurrected, ( which happens with amazing regularity for
such a rare piece) the first thing that any modern builder does is ditch
the sodium filled valves  for SS replacements. The corrosive nature of
the sodium eats at the inside of the valve, weakening it to the point
that valve failure on these is more the rule than the exception. I have
not heard of this on 914 engines, but I do believe that SS is a good way
to go on high performance engines.
