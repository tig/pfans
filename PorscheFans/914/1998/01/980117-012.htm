OK all you old autocrossers out there, I need a little help identifying
some tires.  A friend of mine gave me a set of Hoosier 'Autocrossers',
225/50/15's.  They're bias-ply and have about ten jagged grooves as tread.
The tires came off his 914 when he bought it 4 years ago, but were
autocrossed by the PO.  

The surface is still in very good condition and is soft to the fingernail
test.  The sidewalls look almost brand new.  He gave these to me originally
for fitment purposes to see if I could squeeze 225's under the stock
fenders, but the width on these things is a bit more than the average 225.
I thought I'd mount these and try them out for the heck of it.  I obviously
have no idea how many heat cycles these went through, but like I said, they
look in good shape and have to have at least one more run left in them!

Does anyone have any experience with these or remember these?  They have to
be at least 5 years old or older.

Thanks,

Dion
