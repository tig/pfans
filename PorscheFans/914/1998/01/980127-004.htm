Have your replaced your transmission fluid recently?  If it works OK
when cold, but not when hot, some nice fresh fluid might just do the
trick.  A lot of listees have had good luck with a high-dollar trans
fluid (Red Line something or other - someone else can fill in the
detail).  I just use the regular cheap stuff (20w-90) from my FLAPS and
change it every 12k miles.

If you change your fluid (esp. for the first time), loosen the FILLER
BOLT FIRST!  That way, you don't risk getting stranded by draining your
fluid then not being able to get the filler bolt out to re-fill it.  Get
a good quality 17mm allen (hex) wrench - I got mine at Sears for $15 or
so.

Of course a side shifter is always nice too...

Good luck.
