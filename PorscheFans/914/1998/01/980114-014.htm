Dirk and others interested.
I use a free program called ICQ for immediate communications when online.
Program will let you know when particular parties are connected and let you
chat through the message mode. IMMEDIATELY.

Many can be listed for communications you alone choose for links. 

Downside is all that you communicate with must list their phone number with
you and yours with them. Some may not want this to be known. Each will have
to approve the others for their links to be established.
 
Easier to communicate than waiting for a link where many may not be around
when you want or need to chat as Dirk mentions.

All it does is to establish your links together and when links are active
you can do immediate message dialog!

Do a search while surfing and just download directly from their site.
MIRABILIS ICQ should be your search feature.

I use it exclusively for local use as my son is hard to reach sometimes
since he does a lot of computer use online time. Check it out. I think it
accomodates any links without long distance involved in the 48 states. Very
handy for emergencies should they occur.

Requires Windows 95 I am almost certain, an Internet connection but you
would not be receiving this message if you did not already have one. :0)
