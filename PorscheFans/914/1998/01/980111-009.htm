Hello P-Fans, 

 As usual I have a couple of things to ramble about. 

Thanks for all the personalised plates, keep them coming. Have gotten
some cool ones.

Today is California was the Posche swapmeet. I was able to meet up will
lister Chip @ lisa Evaul and sure enough Lisa was holding down the fort
while Chip was shopping, just like he said. Great to meet you guys !!
and I had talk to them on prior swapmeets and didnt even know who I was
talking too. Chip had some 914 goodies for sale and he and I even
exchanged some green for P-parts ; ) Oh and we talk about all you guys
too..hahaha

and while at the swap meet 

I talk to this couple that sells at all the Porsche meets, Ralph Boothe
(626) 336-1396 anyway I usually dont look at Ralph's stuff just because
he usually had highend 911 stuff...ok to the point.
Ralph had these way cool 2.0L, pedrini, malley hub caps. They looked
just like a stock 2.0L hub cap but had an inlaid Porsche crest. they ran
$25.00each, isnt stock ones around that price ?? these where a very nice
pieces for those in the need. I wish I had some 2.0L fuchs to put them
on they where that nice. As always I dont get anything for these little
adds, just wanted my Porsche buddys to know about something that you
probably wouldnt hear about, He isnt that big. Too Cool.

Well Im sure I can go on, but I have wasted, well used enough bandwith.
See Ya, 
 Don
