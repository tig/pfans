Toby,

Three things can cause this:

1:  Major rust.  But this would cause a BIG difference, not a little
one.
2:  Saggy springs that sagged unevenly.  But the left would sag first.
3:  The alignment is off, and has been off for a while, and you're just
    now noticing it.  (First symptom of shipwright's disease!)

I vote #3.

Your springs are probably shot anyway, very few stock springs can
survive
this long.  And someone lowered the front to make the car look level,
and
this changed the rear alignment.  (And they probably forgot to
disconnect
the sway bar before lowering/leveling the front...  BTDT)

Really nice (120lb progressive) rear springs are about $80 from GPR.  I
would change them BEFORE spending $100 on an alignment.

$.02,
Gary
