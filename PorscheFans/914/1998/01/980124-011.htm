Greetings, 914-er's!

   Many thanks to Jon Lowe and Greg Skalla for their input on
dis-assembling the hand-brake mechanism part of the rear caliper.  
Thanks to to Dr. 914 who apparently has the original write-up on
this.   I will have to order it from AA.

   The long and short of it was that my grunge calipers were in worse
shape than the ones now in service on my 914, and so I ran into the
same broken Torx bit problem that Greg has (more on this later in
this note, Greg).   As a result, I could not see into the inboard
cylinder very well, and had no idea that there was a circlip in
there.   Again, thanks to Greg, Jon, and George for setting me
straight.   Jon is quite right; the thing will NOT come apart with
the inner adjuster in place.   

  Once the caliper was split, I found that my circlip tool could not
be inserted into the holes of the circlip, as it was partially
shrouded, but there was a gap a bit farther back which allowed me to
insert a 1/8" screwdriver and pry it out a bit.   From there, I was
finally able to use the circlip tool and remove the circlip.   After
that, the inner adjuster pulled out with only finger effort, even
after the mangling that I had given it, and then the whole thing came
apart in a most straight-forward manner.

   Now,a bit of advice for Greg on splitting his stubborn caliper
halves.   First, you need a real Torx bit, not a hardware-store
cheapie.   I got mine from my FLMTT (Friendly Local Mac Tool Truck)
and it's made of the right stuff.   The Mac Tool guy pointed out to
me that strictly speaking, the bolts are NOT Torx, but spline.   He
said that the only company that he knew of that had metric spline
drivers in the appropriate size was Snap-On.   If you can find a
Snap-On dealer, you should try to buy the right tool.   This is
because, if you round out one of your bolts (happened to me) you will
have to drill it out.   Better to get the best fit possible on the
driver.

   Next, because of the degree to which these bolts have frozen over
the years, it is unwise to attempt to turn the entire bolt via the
spline / Torx head.   Rather, it is much better to turn the nuts, and
let the friction of the bolt in the caliper bore assist the Torx bit
in holding the bolt still.

   Having said that, I had better tell you how I did it.   I took a
cheapie 1/2" drive 11 mm impact socket, and ground it down on my
bench grinder until it would fit inside the milled holes for the
nuts, and so fit over the nuts far enough to drive them.   I also
ground the chamfer off the end of the impact socket, so that the hex
portion came right to the edge.   I then held the bolt with the Torx
driver (actually, I had my daughter hold it... this procedure may
take two people) and used my big narly 1/2" impact air wrench to wail
on the nut.   When I got tired of this, I used my impact screwdriver
(which has 1/2" square drive output) and copper hammer and wailed on
it for a bit.   Back and forth, with liberal applications of Pep Boys
Super Penetrating Catalyst and it finally spun off.   One down, and
one to go.  (The inner ones came out more easily, as Greg noted.)  
On the last one, the Torx bit slipped, tearing up the bolt head.  
The only alternative now was to drill it out.  I used high speed
steel bits for this... don't.   I now need to buy two new twist
drills.   I suggest that you go out and buy the super-hard
titanium-nitride or carborundum-tipped drills.   I used a large drill
right off, which was another mistake.   After the head was pretty
well drilled, I of course got off center, and that made life more
difficult.   I would suggest drilling a 1/8" or so pilot hole well
into the bolt shank, using what's left of the Torx hole as a guide,
and THEN go to a larger drill and use it to remove the bolt head.  
When you get down near the end, the bolt can be driven out with a pin
punch, much like a drilled out rivet, and the caliper will fall
apart.

   Greg:  If you have to drill out your bolts, I have one that came
out in usable shape that I can let you have... I believe that Dirk
Wright has a source for replacement bolts; perhaps he will chime in
and tell us where to get some, or perhaps we can work up a group
purchase.

 I can't remember who it was that had fluid pouring out by the hand
brake lever, but whoever it was will have to go through the above
procedure, as there is an O-ring around the inner adjuster that keeps
fluid in the piston bore.   There is supposed to be moly grease in
the adjuster / hand-brake portion of the caliper, and that will have
all been washed away by the brake fluid, so it's complete tear-down
time to enable replacement of the O-ring and a re-grease.

   I also can't remember who it was that asked about the aproximately
1" O-rings that were in his kit, but I have now identified where
these go... they are grease seals for the hand-brake lever shaft.  
There is only one per caliper.


   I hope that my fiasco will save someone else from similar
embarrasment.
