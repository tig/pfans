Hi Mike,

For what this is worth, I bought the rebuilt tranny and 4 hardened CV's for
my VW Thing from them about 8 years ago.  They were considered a good
source for these by the VW crowd.  I don't have any recent experience with
them but don't recall seeing anything positive or negative about them on
the VW lists recently.

I haven't had any problems with the CV's I put on the Thing but it is also
a project car so only has about 10K on these CV's.  I got the Lobro brand
back then, they didn't list the other.  Lobro was considered the desirable
brand back then.

Subject:  Low-cost CVs from Transform




I've seen ads for CVs from a company called Transforms in Long Beach,
CA.  They mention they carry German Lobro and Luftringe brands, and on
the phone, they quote $50 each for "hardened racing" CVs for 914s.  At
that price, I'm REAL tempted to buy a whole set, but thought I'd first
ask the list if anyone has experience with them or those brands.
Thanks,
Mike
