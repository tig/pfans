Phans,

What're the drawbacks of having a lexan windshield?  Can you see through
it o.k. at night? The car splits time between street and track, has
aspirations to run a Club race or two this season. No winter use, but
plenty of rain and the like here in the mid west.

About how much do you save in weight if you replace windshield and targa
glass? About how much will you spend? Should I just go on SlimFast
instead?

Just wondering. . .TIA
Thwen.

Not true.  The washer motor on the 914/6 was separate from the bottle.  Uses
the same pump as 911's of the era.  Mounted to the bulkhead under the bottle
with three rubber vibration isolators.  The bottle has a fitting on top for
the hoses vs. going in thru the cap on the 4 cyls.  The bottle is also of
thinner material because it does not have to be pressurized.  It is of the
identical shape however as the 4 cyls.
