I think Im the only one with a combo gauge on the list??

Its not the kit that needs to get re- silkscreened, its the stock gauges
themselves (temp-pres) , so one more step on the building prossess,
witch I think is covered, if you need to silkscreen in the temps as I
did the first time, guess I can do it again.
