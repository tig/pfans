The lever and associated pivot shaft are somehow retained by something
inside the caliper. They don't just come off after the spring is
removed.
Not having a diagram of the internal construction and not seeing
anything
obvious (like a snap ring) anywhere, I'm stuck. I hope George Hussey has
an
answer, something besides the usual "don't take it apart" thing I always

hear from people. Hell, I've been taking stuff apart since I was a
little
kid. It's in my bones damnit! I usually get stuff back together too!

When the emergency brake lever shaft leaks, it is caused by the large
inner caliper adjuster o ring.  Replacing this ring cures the leak.  If
you want to take the lever out, be my guest- Pry out ( or better yet
drill a hole in it and use the old slide hammer) the large "welsh" plug
and go for it.  You will destroy the plug getting it out (It is on the
opposite side of the brake lever) and you will have to find a new one
(Probably at the HARDWARE STORE!) and peen it in.  Good Luck!
