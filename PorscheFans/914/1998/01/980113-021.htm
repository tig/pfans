Hi Joe!

 You asked:

greatly

   Unfortunately, I have lost / misplaced the original author's name
for this.   I cannot take credit for this procedure; I myself have
never done it, but when this came across the list, I grabbed it and
saved it for future reference.   Will the real author please stand up
and take a bow? 
					Thanks,
					Jim T.

There are a number of studs attached to the back of the dashtop, and 
plastic nuts are used to secure the top to the dash frame. I would
begin
by removing the (1) center console; (2) dash bottom pad (bottom 
screws and side screws); (3) steering wheel: (4) guages; (5) glove
box; 
(6) radio; and, (7) ashtray. I would also suggest removing the targa
top for 
additonal light and room to work. There are studs which hold the dash

top down and others which hold it in to the metal dash frame. There
are 
both types on each corner and some in the middle as well. The most 
difficult to access are the two nuts which are located in a very
narrow 
space in the dash frame behind where the guages are typically
located.
   I have found no alternative to using a 13mm wrench (almost
everything 
on these cars is either 13mm or 10mm) to loosen the nuts and then 
squeezing two fingers into the gap to continue turning the nuts. If
you think
this is ridiculously difficult, wait until you have to reinstall the
nuts and
tighten them. Keep a sense of humour and put aside a whole day for
this project.

 Good luck. 

  That's it...

					Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
