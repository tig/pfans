Nick,
Excellent choice of welder and advice by John Dunkle.

The book that I used for reference is superb, but pricey. Over $50.
Modern Welding, Goodheart:Wilcox. Covers ANY type of welding, theory,
materials including Plastic and all general knowledge needed from the
beginner to Industrial Engineering and the professional welder.

You can pick up a good instruction book at your local library. Once you get
started, its really downhill from then on. Use good safety practices. Avoid
welding in any area that has flammable items laying around and keep a good
extingusher at hand. And as John stated, PRACTICE on scrap metal. Not your car!
Home Depot sells above Lincoln mig welder for $299 and they also sell a book
if you want to purchase. DON'T buy a No Name, cheap, mailorder welder. It is
not a good investment and will usually be junk in a short while.

Area vocational schools usually have a 4 to 6 week course for beginners.
Check around your area.

I appreciate David Condreay's confidence in my posts about welding. There
appears to be a good number of 914 owners who appear comfortable using this
particular skill so if you get to a point of questions. Bang it out on the
keyboard, pop in the mail and someone will be around to assist usually in
less than an hour.

DISCLAIMER: As someone advised me to state, and that is good advice for all,
what I and others write, use at your own risk. Its your own responsibility.

Good Luck.

Mike Cooley
