Correct me if I'm wrong, but MSHP only replaces the exhaust valves with SS
valves, since the exhaust valves were originally sodium filled... right?  At
least, that's what they did with my heads.  They left my intake valves alone
(they only had about 1000 miles on them), and replaced my sodium filled
valves with SS valves, claiming that they seat much better, and that the
"new" SS valves are better at dissipating heat than the older alternatives
to sodium filled valves had been.  I still don't know if I believe it, but I
thought I'd mention it since you said that the intake valves are the only
ones that failed.
