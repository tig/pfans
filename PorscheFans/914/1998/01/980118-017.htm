Dion,

Hoosier still makes and sells these tires. Guess what! They are still
competitive even on the national level. They're great for those of us who
like to still drive their cars on the  street because you can use street
alignment and these tires do best. I run 0 degrees camber front and rear
for Autocrossers.

The bad news is how old your tires are. I got a real good deal on a used
set that sounded a lot like yours. Because of age they never stuck that
well, never wore out either ;-).

But if you are just having fun on them, why not?

Subject: Old Hoosier autocross tires?

OK all you old autocrossers out there, I need a little help identifying
some tires.  A friend of mine gave me a set of Hoosier 'Autocrossers',
225/50/15's.  They're bias-ply and have about ten jagged grooves as
tread.
The tires came off his 914 when he bought it 4 years ago, but were
autocrossed by the PO.  

The surface is still in very good condition and is soft to the fingernail
test.  The sidewalls look almost brand new.  He gave these to me
originally
for fitment purposes to see if I could squeeze 225's under the stock
fenders, but the width on these things is a bit more than the average
225.
I thought I'd mount these and try them out for the heck of it.  I
obviously
have no idea how many heat cycles these went through, but like I said,
they
look in good shape and have to have at least one more run left in them!

Does anyone have any experience with these or remember these?  They have
to
be at least 5 years old or older.

Thanks,

Dion
