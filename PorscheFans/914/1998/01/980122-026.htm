Something to note here about short shift kits. Yes, they reduce the total throw
of the shift lever. However this is not free. Two things will result here. One:
increased shifter effort. And as a result of that effort... Two: increased
synchro wear!

If you normally take 0.5 seconds to make a shift and the short shift (once you
get used to it) allows you to shift in 0.3 seconds, you are substantially
increasing teh load on the synchro. The teeth have to slide over a certain
distance regardless of how long it takes to make that trip. If you force the
shift harder than you used to, then the synchro ring has to work that much
harder, and will wear out that much quicker. It has less time to come up to
speed.

If your shits started grinding when you installed the kit and you couldn't make
it not grind with fresh linkage bushings and carfull shifting, then chances were
that your synchro rings were already pretty worn.
