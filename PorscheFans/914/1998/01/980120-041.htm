Hi Wesley!

   You asked:

   I just looked at my 914 starter, and your description of terminals
does not quite match, but I think we are stuck in semantics and not
mechanically.   If one extends a line from the center of the starting
motor long axis through the center of the solenoid long axis, it will
pass through two studs and miss the push-on terminal, which is the
solenoid control winding.

   The stud furthest from the motor itself should have a fairly large
red wire on it, which is (as I recall) the alternator output lead,
and also, an even larger black wire, which is the battery cable.  
Both of these wires go to the outermost stud; NO wires go to the one
closest to the motor; if you examine it closely, you will see a short
bare braided pigtail which is the input lead for the motor itself.
This is all that should be on the innermost stud.

   The remaining wire (in your case yellow) is the starter control
wire, and supplies 12 volts to the solenoid from the ignition switch
when the key is turned to the "start" position, thereby causing the
engine to crank.  This wire should have a push-on type terminal, and
goes to the one and only mating flag terminal on the solenoid.

   I hope this clarifies, rather than confuses the issue.

                                                            Jim T.
