These things look relatively simple to build.  Surely someone out there
must have built one and have the plans available.  From the picture I've
seen they appear to attach to the bumper mounting holes, is this
correct?
It doesn't seem that those attachments would be able to support the
chassis weight , stripped or not.

REPLY:
Yes, the rotisserie is realitively simple in concept, and Yes, the
mounting points on the chassis are the bumper mounts. Since the mounting
points are nearly entirely loaded in shear, assuming the rotisserie is
stiff (more on this later), there is little chance of damaging a chassis
that has been stripped of drive train and suspension. 
CAVEAT:  there are chassis that have enough rust that any attempt to
pick them up by their ends will probably cause terminal harm!!!

Having built such a rotisserie, let me offer a description that should
allow any interested party to build one without "plans".  I'm of the
opinion that if you can't envision how to construct the rotisserie by
sketching your own plans from the description for the purpose of
determining the materials necessary, then you probably shouldn't be
trying to put a chassis on a rotiserie for any level of work that
demands a rotisserie. 

Essentially the rotisserie is made up of two tall engine stands that
allow rotation of the chassis, on its long axis, through a full 360
degree turn.  
The first step was to create the "adapters" that connect to the bumper
mounts, working from the surface of the car outwards: 
1) 1.5" square tubing was cut to length to fit vertically over both
bumper mounting holes at all four corners of the chassis,
2) holes were drilled through the 1.5" tubing at the center distance of
the existing holes in the chassis to allow 5/8" bolts to pass fully
through the 1.5" tubing and the chassis,
3) the 1.5" verticals were bolted to the car with large washers as
backing plates against the inner chassis surfaces,
4) 1.5" square tubing pieces were welded to the verticals already bolted
to the car to act as horizontal extensions away from the car, front and
rear (triagular gussets and reinforcements can be welded in place
later); these extensions allow a horizontal 2" square tube to be welded
across the front and rear of the car like pseudo bumpers; the idea is to
clear the curved shape of the chassis.
Note: use the floor of the garage as a reference point for the
positioning of the horizontal extensions and the horizontal 2" cross
bars, since you want the car to be able to freely rotate on a horizontal
plain.
5) round tubes (i.e. 2" diameter) about 8" long are welded horizontally
to the mid point of the front and rear 2" cross bar, extending away from
the car to act as the pivot points
At this point you have fabricated what will appear to be one UGLY set of
bumpers with a battering ram front and rear!  Now you're ready to
procede with the "tall engine stands".

The stands are constructed in a manner that will serve several purposes.
While it is obvious that they need to be tall enough to allow clear 360
degree rotation, and that they must support the weight of the chassis
(and rollcage if being installed), there is a very important additional
function.  The front and rear stands must be "joinable" at their bases
before the weight of the chassis is allowed to settle on the stands, or
the stands will try to slide away from each other at their bases,
putting a bending load into the chassis mounting points.  This can
damage the chassis at the mounts, but more importantly, can cause
chassis "sag" since the weight of the chassis is supported at points
further apart than otherwise ever happens.  NOT GOOD if you're doing
this in the first place to do chassis rust repair.  

The answer is to build the base of each stand from 2.5" square tubing in
the form of an "H", with rollers under each point of the H; the long
parallel legs of the H are aligned with the chassis' long axis.  This
will allow two 20+ ft. long 2" square tubes to slide in and out of the
2.5" square tubing legs of the "H"s.  Hole are drilled in the top
surfaces of the H near the ends, and nuts which will accept 5/8" bolts
are welded over the holes.  This will allow the 5/8" bolts to be
tightened down on the 2" square tube that is within the 2.5" square
tube, holding it in place to prevent the bases from moving apart when
the chassis is on the finished rotisserie.
The verticals of the end stands can be fabricated from 2.5" square
tubing.  The height must allow for the chassis to clear the bases of the
end stands and the "joiners" that run the length of the chassis.  The
"high" points are the windshield frame and the roll bar.
The verticals are welded to the "H" base at the mid point of the joining
bar of the "H".  A 6" long piece of 3" round tubing is welded to the top
of the vertical to act as the "receiver" of the round tube on the
"bumper adapters".  A hole is drilled in the top of the 3" round tube,
over which a nut that accepts a 5/8" bolt is welded in place to allow
the rotation of the chassis to be fixed at any point.

When the whole appartus is ready, the chassis is lifted to the height of
the pivot points and the end stands are slid into place over the pivot
points of the "bumper adapters".  BEFORE the weight of the chassis is
put on the end stands, the bolts on the base of the H's that act on the
long 2" square "joiners" must be securely tightened to prevent the
stands from moving apart under load.

When the rotisserie described was built 3 years ago, the materials cost
about $200 and it took one weekend, designing as the construction went
along.  It will never qualify as a work of art, but is sure works well,
seems to be more than strong enough, and makes welding of sheet metal
much easier than trying overhead.  With its wheels, it allows the
chassis to be moved to the side in the garage, and if the chassis is
turned 90 degrees, takes up minimal floor space when work is not not
being done.
Hope this is helpful,
Larry
