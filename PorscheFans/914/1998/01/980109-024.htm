Alan,
The footrest came with mine, April 1970. Mine was mousey grey. I put it in
the front compartment and left it there as long as I owned the 914 when my
wife said she did not like it as she rode in that seat. When she didn't, it
tumbled about when cornering. It had a snap retainer, but was affixed to
just one end so it was bothersome. 
Auto Atlanta shows it in their 914 catalog under hard parts, but only as
line art drawn by their illustrator. I am sure they have one. They are pricey.  
It can also be seen in the owners manual of that year I believe but am not
certain. Anyone care to verify?
