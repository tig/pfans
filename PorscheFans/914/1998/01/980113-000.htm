I'd be grateful if anyone can offer advice on the following problem I
have with my '74 914-4: The drivers side handbrake mechanism does not
appear to be releasing after handbrake use. The piston on the inner
(car) side of the caliper stays projected when the cable is released
meaning the pad continues to bind against the disc. I can release it by
prising a blade between the disc and the pad, but obviously not a
routine you want to use after every application! Strangely the piston
works fine when the foot brake is being used..........The pads are quite
worn and I wonder if this has anything to do with the problem, for
instance is the piston being asked to travel beyond the point at which
the parking brake mechanism can return the piston?

I have been told that you can remove the piston and there is some kind
of mechanism inside the caliper that operates the parking brake which
sometimes comes loose, but I don't have a good knowledge of the inside
features of a caliper so I am a little nervous of wading in without
advice of those who may have faced this before. I would like to avoid
purchasing a re-built unit if possible as the current caliper is in good
working order apart from the parking brake, and the cost is some =A390
($144).=20

Thanks in advance.


Phil.
