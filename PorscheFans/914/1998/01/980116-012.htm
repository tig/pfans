	All--
	I've been away for a while, but I think I've caught up by using
the archives.  (Wonderful thing, those archives!)  I followed with inter-
est the threads on lurkers vs. newbies vs. "old hands" and comments about
advice given and recieved.
	A number of years ago, I picked up a 1.8 for all the wrong reasons
(mostly the cool Alaska Blue Metallic color).  A while later, I came across
the Porschephiles mailing list.  For several years, the list was full of my
questions about 914s.  A lot of them.
	Things had calmed down a bit, and then I bought my 2 liter.  The
list was full of my 914 questions again.  After a while, that calmed down
too.  I started doing more of my own work, and started sharing my experi-
ences.  Often, I would have a recently-done procedure still in my head when
someone else would ask, "How do you do this?"  I started answering more
questions than I asked.
	A call came through for a 914 FAQ, so I volunteered.  I put toge-
ther what I had learned from the list, and from reading books and magazines
and from any other sources I could find.
	Then the Pfiles list crashed, and the Pfans lists started.  I had
kept a lot of the advice people had given me, and I had written down some
of my own stuff.  And I was (and am) often willing to share any and all of
this info.
	All of a sudden, people started referring to me as an "expert".
(EEEK!)

	There's only one path from novice to expert: Ask lots of questions.
Do as much research as you can find time to do.  Break your car.  Often.
Then fix it (or have someone else fix it), and write down what happened and
what you did.
	Example:  I know *much* more about engine removal and disassembly
than I *EVER* wanted to know.  That comes from doing it four or five times.
I wish that I hadn't even done it once (and my wallet does too!) but things
broke and I had to fix them.

	So don't be afraid to ask questions.  And, if someone asks one that
you know the answer to (especially if you've just done the same thing), then
by all means answer them.
	Remember, though, that Pfans is all FREE advice.  Which is worth
every penny that you pay for it.  When at all possible, verify the info you
get here on your own.  Sometimes people are mistaken, sometimes they're
(OK, "we're") just plain WRONG.

	Oh, and for licences:  My (now-gone) 1.8 was "MID VW18".  A local
(SF Bay Area) 914 has been spotted with, "BUG GUTZ".  (My fave!!)
