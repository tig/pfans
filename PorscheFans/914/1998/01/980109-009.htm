-dissipating-? That would imply a good thermal conductivity, which
stainless does NOT have. That's why I'm hesitant to belive that
stainless valves are a good idea. Now maybe it's just that I havn't had
my morning coffee, but I would want something that was capable of
transfering the heat _away_ from the valve head into the stem where the
contact with the guide and the oil can draw off the heat. 

We know that exhaust gases are very very hot (1000 degrees give or take)
so we have a tremendous heat source on the head of the valve and around
the base. Now stainless is pretty poor thermal conductor, so this can
been seen in two ways. One, it's such a poor conductor that the head
does not actually absorb much of that heat. And conversely, it's a poor
conductor, and hence all that heat stays trapped in the head and can't
be drawn out through the stem. I don't buy any argument that says that
the head of the valve doesn't absorb too much heat. It's in a constant
environment of high temperatures. And I know that stainless can absorb
heat. 

For example, I had made a set of tongs for use in a cryogenic bath (LN2)
and they were made of stainless. The end of the tongs could stay
immersed in LN2, after reaching equilibrium, for a very long time
without the handle becoming frozen. What I mean by this is that both
sides were at a stable equilibrium. The warm side was staying warm
without causing the LN2 to boil away, and the cold side was staying cold
without the handle becoming frozen. Very little heat transfer.

The same applies to an exhaust valve. If the heat transfer is so poor,
the heat in the valve head will remain there and not be able to be
dissipated throught the stem where that heat can be drawn away and
disposed of (into the head where air and oil can draw off the heat).

If I'm wrong, I'll be the first to accept it. But like I said, I havn't
had my morning coffee, so I could just spouting nonsense for all I
know...
