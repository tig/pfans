Probably because many people do just want to sit back and read what others have
to say. Or just don't feel like they have anything worth saying. To the former,
I have no problem. If you want to lurk, then lurk. I'm not going to fault you
for that in the least. To the latter? Everyone has something worth saying on
this list. If you own (or are thinking of owning) a 914, then you are bound to
come up with a question that will inspire at least one of us to chime in about
and maybe even solve your delima.

That is not unusual on large mailing lists. Take a look at P-philes (the P-fans
predecesor). There was an extreemly vocal minority on a list that had well in
excess of 1200 members. If everyone had something to yak about every day, the
list would quickly become intollerable or unreadable due to nothing else but
the sheer volume of mail.

Yes, speak up. I (we) don't care one way or the other if you just bought your
first car (and it's a 914, what could be wrong with that) or if you're the most
experienced E-Prepared engine builder on the planet. Everyone's voice is
welcome on the list.

These are invaluable to be sure. And I think that anyone who has worked on such
documents deserves a hand!

John, while a newcomer to the 914 list, is not a newcomer to P-cars. He has a
great deal of experience racing and building P-cars as a hobby. The fact that
he has finally seen the true path, and purchased a 914 for a project car, is a
delight to all of us I'm sure. :)

Well, not to be picky, but Dirk, myself, and numerous others, have indeed
written step-by-steps to various things over the years. They may not however,
have been archived on one of the web sites or anywhere else for that matter.
For myself, I'm sorry if that stuff has become lost. But alot of the time it's
just the bouncing of ideas off each other.

Speaking for myself, if someone is currious about how I came to a certain
conclusion, just ask! It's often that I simply don't have the time to go in
depth on a topic and I just get straight to the point. But if you want to know
more, by all means ask. I'll be more than happy to go in depth when I have the
time (like right now ;).

Hurm. Tip. That's a huge issue. And I don't think most people are going to
spend an entire day just thinking up what helped on a little niggly problem or
a major one that may have cropped up a year or ten ago.

I think this is a great offer! And very magnanimous too. Thanks John! This is
by no means a minor thing, but I do know that John has the resources to make it
work, and not everyone does. Thanks again John. And to the other sites, Tim's
page, The Renegade page, and the others that I too will get flack for not
mentioning, thank you for all of the great work!

Oh sure you are! :) But it's a well spent waste of bandwidth. ;)
