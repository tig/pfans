All,

These are the best of times....The plan for my 14 (which has been
lifeless for well over ten years; two in my possession) is as follows
over the next month.  Tie up loose ends, finish prepping for paint,
having base painted and painting some panels (rockers, tail, roof, trim)
myself, install windshield, get light inspection, get VIN verified, and
finalizing registration.  I can see the light.

Here is the beauty of it.  I recently also bought a 240z and registered
it today.  No smog certificate, 35 bucks, and away we go...Thank you to
all who supported SB42 in CA!
The 14 will go through just as easy even though it sports a Webber.

Now the second part of my glee.  My 14 will be driven only on weekends
and I should be able to keep the mileage down.  The Z is also a project
car (I save the Galant for driving into the ground).  So, I had my
insurance agent quote me for Classic Car insurance on the 914 and Z;
full coverage, 2500mi/yr, garaged, clubs.  The total quote for BOTH
cars.........$138/yr!  Not bad for a household which blows almost 5
grand a year on other vehicle insurance...

I'll have to see if I can stay within the mileage constraints, but with
this kind of incentive, I almost have to.  The Z may to to regular
insurance and ultimately I could part with the Z since it hasn't hit my
heart like the 14.
