You'll find that this is the same thread used by the spare tire clamp.
Getting an idea yet? :) Yup, rear storage of the spare tire!

Factory ski rack! I thought about using 'em for mounting a cold air
intake scoop someday. Probably not, but it'd look pretty wierd.

I dunno, you'd be supprised how much thought I've put into utilizing
those ski rack mounts. Another idea is to mount a crossbar for a video
camera mount for autoxes. Be a great angle, but I'm not sure if the top
of the windshield would get in the way or not.
