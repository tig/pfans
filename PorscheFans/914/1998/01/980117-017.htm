I'm mounting them on 15x7" replica rims.

Glass flares held on by dusz fasteners should solve my clearance problems.
Fitting these things is going to be a real joy.

Because for the time being, I still have to drive the thing to the events
and I don't have that extra set of wheels yet.  I'm still working on
acquiring this set...

I'm also beafing up the suspension.  Just got the 911 front-end on today
and I'm finishing up the rear over the next few weeks.  

Later,

Dion
