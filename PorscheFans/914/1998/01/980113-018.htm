Hello 914'ers

I was at the Porsche swapmeet this weekend (Pomona, California). I meet
these guys and they seem to have there act together and know P-parts
(they got some parts I wanted..damn it!) 
Anyways I dont know them and am not getting anything out of this post,
just wanted to pass it on. I also checked out there cool web site. If
you want to see what kinda Porsches that are for sale and show at the
Pomona swapmeet,  check there site out, they must have a Digital camera,
because My picture is on the site (Sunday Night!) with this Beautiful
914 2.0L that was for sale for $7,500.00 but you should have seen the
car. 
Ok rambled enough.
