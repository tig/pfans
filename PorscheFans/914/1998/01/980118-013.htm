I'm interested in the combo guage as well. When can we expect them?

Are all 911 oil pressure guages calibrated the same? Which oil pressure
sender is this compatible with. I ask because I have a cheap, standard
vdo oil pressure guage which operates, but is not accurate (reads about
170% what it should) when used with the late model (89+) oil pressure
sender.

Its mine. Its being reproduced and one of the list members other than
myself will be offering for sale soon.
