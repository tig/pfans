John,
I assume you mean the pointer, and not the welder; I don't want the ASPCA
on my back...=;^)  The pointer works great; my dog is hyper-active, and
probably medium+ intelligence.  If you turn it on somewhere where he can
spot it, he'll never stop chasing it.  I'm mean, and let him pounce on
"it" ever now and again, turning it off when he lands on it.  It drives
him nuts trying to figure out where it went.  I don't know about the eye
damage part, but I never shine it into his face.  I suppose it could cause
damage; that what it says on the side.
I only paid $15 for it at Frye's; seems much better/more effective than
some other toys I have bought for him..

Mike
