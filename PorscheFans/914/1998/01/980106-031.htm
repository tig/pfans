Hey Gary, 
Yeah it seems so simple, I dont know why someone on the list hasnt done
or tryed it, Far cheaper than Vellios. I do believe a small spacer
between the caliper and the mount is required (I'll look at the one in
his shop in a few days) I cant remember that either, if they do have to
be turned down and they may, then Im screwed..I just (several months
ago) bought new cross drilled Carrera rotors. I will let you know on
both in a few days, hell I have all the parts and a car on stands, I
guess I could go check it out and report back.
He dose drill a hole through the trailing arm, thats the only mod that I
know of. Use's all the 911 ebrake stuff, hell you only need that one
little plate with the shoes on it.
Yes you can use Carrera rears.
Can it be that easy ??????????????Sounds like it.
