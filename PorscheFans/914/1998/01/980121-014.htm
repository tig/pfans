Thanks, Mike. While I _am_ concerned with scratching and overall safety,
legality isn't really at issue. I'm in a county w/o vehicle inspection.
No inspection, smog or otherwise, of any kind. There's a van driving
around town that doesn't even have a windshield. The guy just bundles up
and wears goggles when it rains or snows! And if I ever move anywhere
_with_ inspection, small chance my headers, Trapp, etc. will pass <gg>,
so it'll be track only at that point. Still, it might be worth doing the
rear (and maybe sides) window, at least.

BTW, how does PPG safety glass differ from OEM?

Thanks again,
Thwen.
