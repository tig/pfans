to scrap it off and risk getting stuff inside the intake.  Thanks for your
help.

It's not a bad idea to remove the intake plenum during this process, and check
it for cracks.  Poor idling and difficulty in getting a proper mixture can
sometimes be attributed to hidden cracks in the bottom of the plenum.

3M makes silicone grease and should be available from any parts source that
handles 3M.

I am aware that AutoAtlanta claims

to be the ultimate source for a good 914, and have heard that they have

a wide variety to choose from, but I want to check with the experiences

of this group to confirm or deny this.

What experience have you had with them? 

Also, even if you have no experience with them, you may have another

good source or have one for sale yourself. Any pertinent experience or

info would be appreciated.



Thanks very much in advance,

'76 911S Targa

Nathan,

From my personal experience I can not recommend purchasing a car from
Automobile Atlanta.  I purchased a steel flaired 73 2.0 with some upgrades for
$14000 primarily on the reputation of AA.  This car had rust that shouldn't
have been in a car of this price range, and it was NOT an original 2.0 but a
converted 1.7. Even if  your friend wanted to, I would doubt if he be able to
purchase a '73-'74 2.0 from AA or anywhere for 5K.  The last time I was at AA
and looked a cars like this it was more like $9500 or  more.  Realisically the
preferred 2.0's are more like $7500 in the east and mid west, and cheaper in
CA.  If your friend has plenty of time, I'd recommend checking out several
cars and plan to do some traveling.

that the brake handle is attached to?

The longitudinals are the "pontoons" on either side of the 914 Brad.  This is
the boxed section that runs down either side of the car, and is the outer
framework for the 914.  Yes, the handbrake lever is attached to the inner
longitudinal.  The outer suspension mounts and jack posts are attached to the
outboard side of these longitudinal sections.  These parts of the car are very
susceptable to corrosion from salt and road debris building up behind the
black rocker panels.
