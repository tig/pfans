Hello Chris and other list dwellers, 

I will add "2MORE" it to the growing list of plates because it is a cool
one. As far as you other post about the plate on your honda, Last year
when I finally got my non running 914-6 project to pass smog (ha dont
ask) Went to the DMV stood forever in line (no appt again) got my slip
of paper to take to the ladie at the plate window, never looked at the
plate number I was getting, got plate walked away, looked at new plate
and it was something like "abcd915" of course I thought oh shit one
number off, ran back to the window to see if I could have "abcd914" and
they just gave it to a dealership person...damn, and couldnt change it, 
oh well.

I have a buddy that got ****914 on his 911 plate and really hates it
when we bring it up, so we do often ;  )

Later, 
 DOn
