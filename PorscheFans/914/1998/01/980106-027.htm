Boy this is an old one.

Why Dirk, when Jon Lowe WWW site has done such a good job of it.  And I
know he doesn't have the time currently to write a book.  BTW, a book
documenting all the variations of a GT would be 12 times as big as any
current 914 book available.  Why because no 1 GT was built just like
another.  Even parts of the same part number are different.  Why because
they where built by apprentices, not a bad thing, but each person had a
way of doing things and each car is different.  If you need proof look at
all the different ways they mounted the front hood.  Yes they all used
pins, and clips (which you can buy at Farm and Fleet for  pennies) but
the plates that are under the pins are different.  Some are flat, some
have raised beveled edges.  Each one is different.  Which makes the car
really interesting and the study of it a life long process.  

My review of the latest will have to wait, but I am not holding my
breath, it has a pretty tough mark to leap for me, Das Grosse, will be
hard to leap over for any one book.

Take care,
