Dirk,
thanks, but they have long since been answered.  but now that i see you sig.
file, i have a new question. (i guess this takes me out of the lurking
category!)  i remember reading in a previous post that there is someone out
there making new hubs for a 914 and they mentioned that they could put bavaria 4
piston calipers on the 914 strut.  i assume that they don't bolt straight up.
have you done any research into the compatibility of this? i know the 320i
calipers don't take too much of a mod to get them to work, is this true for the
bavaria also?  do you have any extra calipers laying around to try matching up?
i had 2 bavarias a while ago, and of course i just got rid of all my extra parts
because i figured i would never need them.

     thanks for the reply - John
