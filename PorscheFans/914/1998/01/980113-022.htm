   This is in reply to questions asked me by Toby and Mike:


"   Okay, this helps.  I need to adjust the mounting screws.  Neither
my Haynes nor 
my 914-4/914-6 manual (the orangish yellow one) was very helpful in
adjusting 
the headlamp body/assembly, just in adjusting the headlamp beam.  I
was under 
the impression that the knob could be used to adjust the headlamp's
closed 
position as mine went down a tad too far.

Thanks,
     Toby Erkson   "

  I think that you will have to experiment with some of the other
adjustments;  on my car, one can the knob a few turns, and then the
motor starts on it's own (either spinning the knob out of your
fingers, or if you hang on tight enough, unscrewing it) and the
headlight moves to the opposite position that it was in before you
started turning the knob, and stops there.

"    Hi,
You mentioned "Motor travel Limit Switches".  I've been trying to
determine if there was such a thing and how to adjust them.  I'm in
the
process of building a custom-bodied 914 ( from junkyard orphan) and
want
to have headlight buckets come about half way up and use new
projector
beam (PIA type) lights. Short of making manual or Pneumatic lifts I
can't figure out how to limit upward travel.  Any ideas?
Thanks,
Mike

   I am pretty sure that I saw some limit (or position sensor)
switches when I last had the plastic covers off the motor drive area
inside the front trunk.   As I recall, there were some leaf-type
switches attached to the side of the gear cases on the motors, but I
don't recall for sure.  At any rate, they are pretty obvious by their
appearance and the wiring going to them (as I recall).   It is now
dark when I get home from work, and I won't have a chance to take my
own covers off until I finish my current long work week, which should
be Jan. 23.   If you want to wait until then, I will try to take a
look for you.  
   However, I think that once you have the black plastic side covers
off, the mechanism is pretty self-explanatory, with the exception of
the wiring details.   I am still not sure how they manage to
accomplish all of the logic functions that they seem to with only one
relay, but I think that they are helped out in this by the fact that
the motor only runs in ONE direction to drive the lights both up and
down.   In other words, I believe that the gear mechanism is a sort
of crank, that goes around and around, with stop switches at it's two
extremes of travel.   This might make what you propose to do somewhat
difficult;  you may end up having to change the lever arm length or
fulcrum position to change the length of travel.
   I hope that this is of some help.

                                                            Jim T.
