I was away fir the last three days and just got back to the mail. I have
a couple of inputs to a few questions. 
Rusty nuts and bolt removal:
There are a few products (yes, with cheesy names) to try. PB Blaster is
probably one of the best to use with time. Also try (is the real name,
honest) a product called "Nuts-Off" by Spray Products out of Norristown
Pennsylvania. I used to sell it in the truck aftermarket. GOOD STUFF.
Must allow to sit and soak on both these products. I am always leery of
the heat method while in the home environment. No cherry red here (that
happened a long, long time ago - sick mind!)
Also, Dirk since you like the Corvair so much, this might you to become
an owner if you are ever near this God for saken part of the country (I
was just passing through, I swear). 
Found in the Bulletin Board (so-called Alabama's No. 1 buy-sell-trade
your sister newspaper)
" '66 Corvair Monza, two door, hard top, 110pg (what the hell is pg?
hp?), all there, good floors and trunk, not running $500 cash or trade
for sig, ?, FN, MAC, TECQ, M-1, Colt, SW, or 308 mil rifle, will sell
without engine and trans for $250. SIO No hunting type guns.
334-213-0460"
YEEEE HAAAAAWWW!!!!!!!
I guess once you loose interest in Corvairs, you have the need to own
assault weapons? to protect your stash, secrets about family affairs? Ha,
ha.
Dirk this just might be the ticket?!!!!
