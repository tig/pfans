Hi Ben and anyone interested,

I can only tell you a tiny bit.  I had never welded before, I bought the
MityMite welder and both the attachments you mentioned from Eastwood.   I
don't think much of the MityMite, very hard to control and especially for a
beginner.  I had a friend who was a professional welder try it and he had
problems also.  He said he hated these little buzz box type units.  He
recommended a small MIG unit for most car work and especially for a
beginner learning to weld.

So I haven't tried the spot or stitch attachments.  They may work better
but I don't have the skill to evaluate them.  The quality of the units
looks good, they are made in England.  If I can find the manuals that came
with the attachments I'll look and can send you what they say are the
requirements for the control unit.  I don't know if they would work with
your large Lincoln arc welder.

I'd been looking at the small Lincoln 100 MIG welder. Then I found that
PriceCostco had started carrying the Century 130 unit which has a few more
features than the Lincoln 100, like totally adjustable heat range.  It is
normally more expensive but at Costco it was $399 (with the gas regulator)
which is about the same as the Lincoln.  So I got one.  Now I just need a
gas bottle and to clean up space in the garage to start practicing.

Subject:  More welding questions




I've been on this list for about two months now, and I've got to say,
this is the best list I've ever seen. I've picked up more good
information and I thought I knew a lot about the 914 from owning one
(actually I've owned 4 all together) for 13 years.
Anyway, I've been reading with interest the talk about welding. I've done
a fair amount of arc welding when I was a lot younger and have acquired
and set up a Lincoln Arc welder (220) in my garage. I've still to strike
a rod to metal but am itching to get started again.
I get an Eastwood catalog that talks about a couple items that look good
to me. One is a "Stitch welding" attachment that you are supposed to be
able to use with an arc welder. It says you can weld light guage steel
with it. Will this unit work with my Lincoln?
They also advertise a "spot weld" attachment for an arc welder. Will this
thing work on my Lincoln and has anyone had any experience with this
unit?
Thanks for all your great help!
