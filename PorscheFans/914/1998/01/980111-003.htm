<<Hi All, 

After reading the threads on the BFG R1's I thought great, I will buy
these since I want a good sticky tire for the street and I dont plan on
rain driving. Reason being my race buddy just spent $1100.00 for very
good street tires (cant remember brand) and I know I want the same after
driving his car, I think they where BFG's for the street ??
So I went to him and ask, why spend a grand when for what half that he
could have very sticky tires (R1's) "He said" that R1's arent good for
the street because they are too soft and they tend to throw up sticky
rubber and every rock off the street that you run over and will ruin
your paint. I know every one has an option, but his his a good one ??
There is no way I really want to risk that, I know rock chips happen, by
why speed the process up ???
Just wondering out loud..............

When I bought my '86 951, she was wearing Goodyear GSC-S tires
(Goodyear's R-rated tire).  I drove around town like that for about two
weeks until my new street tires finally arrived.  Although the grip they
offered was absolutely astonishing (even in the wet -- standing water
aside), the GSC-S's *did* pick up every bit of gravel and debris on the
street and throw it into the wheel wells.  During this short period of
time, this never seemed to result in any paint chips, but the racket it
caused on some roads was pretty disconcerting.  If you are paranoid
about your car's cosmetics, the sound alone may drive you crazy -- but
boy, do those tires stick!
