You're not kidding about the cost of rust repair. I spent 3,500$ on my 2002
over the last month and a half, and that was with me doing all of the
assembly and disassembly. No paint job either, except on the repaired
sections. My body guy did an excellent job and I highly recommend him to
anyone. It is just extremely time consuming to do a good job. It was at the
end of the second day before the first rocker panel went on the car, that's
how long it took to rip out the old one, repair the inner rocker (including
fabricating the parts because they are NLA), clean and rustproof the inner
rocker, and fit and weld on the new rocker. The other side took just as
long, plus I had lots of rust holes in bad places like fender wells and
floors and shock towers. I was also extremely fortunate that he allowed me
to "help out" by allowing me to do all of the disassembly, re-assembly
(removing bumpers, fenders, lights, etc.), rust proofing and general stupid
things that dont' require any skill. He said I saved a lot of money doing it
that way. I took a week off from work and went to work on the car out at his
shop. I had a good time, but it is extremely time consuming to do a good job.

Sorry to clog up the system with the same posting, but I failed to add my
address to this posting last week.  (it is a great car though!)


FOR SALE  '73 914  Marathon Blue, 3.0 SC 6 conversion, no expense spared.

This car was purchased at an outrageous price from a certain 914 business near

Atlanta GA. and was featured in some of their ads.  I subsequently repaired
all the "free rust" and completely corrosion treated the chassis.
Longitudinals, center tunnel and all dead air

spaces cleaned and painted with Corroless.  Engine bay and rear trunk
repainted.  This car has the following upgrades and conversion parts:


911 Blistein front struts with new inserts and new wheel bearings

Aluminum front cross member (bead blasted and clear coated)

Brembo 4 piston front calipers (modified to fit above struts)

New Bilstein rear struts with Paragon adjustable spring perches

New 150lb Hyperco rear springs

Rear calipers spaced for vented rotors

Vented cross drilled rotors - all around

7 & 8 x 15" factory Fuchs

Totally rebuilt trans with factory 901 limited slip

Weltmeister short shift kit

1978 Euro 3.0 (larger intakes) with aprox 8K miles on fresh top end

New Weber 40's with K & N Watershields

New Bosch 911 carb fuel pump

New Permatune CD box with integrated coil

New Stainless Braided plug wires

Factory 914-6 muffler - JET HOT coated

Custom hydraulic clutch pkg

Patrick Motorsports 4 to 6 chrome moly engine bar  ( 8.5 lbs)

Patrick Motorsports 4 to 6 3.0  clutch pkg

Velios aluminum oil tank

Mocal 25 row oil cooler, Mocal oil t-stat, AN braided stainless oil lines, &

alum -12 fittings

New leather shift boot

Momo anatomical shift knob

Leather 930S steering wheel with Porsche crest

Porsche factory in dash CD player

H4 headlights

Euro split bucket turn signals with Euro lenses

Euro rear lenses

Chrome bumpers

New top and window seals
New column switches
Intermittent wipers
Scheduled for show quality re-paint in 4 weeks (although car still looks great
would sell for less- as is)



The above parts list exceeds $20K, and that doesn't include install.  An
excellent, reliable performer you could drive anywhere.  Less than 10 K miles
on engine, trans, and conversion.  Faster than a SC and some 3.2 Carreras.  I
have nothing to hide on with this car,  I am starting a 914 shop and have
everything on hand to build this car all over again.  If George is asking $45K
for a flaired 3.0 914 with a bare bones interior  $27,000 obo for this car is
a great deal!  I could also sell with less expensive interior, wheels, and
exhaust system, for less $ of course!
