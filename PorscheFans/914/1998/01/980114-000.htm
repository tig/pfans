I already set up a chat room on IRC. Not too many people are able to make it
any specific time, so it hasn't been used much. Part of this is my fault I
guess, since I said I would be there monday nights around 8PM eastern time.
Well, sometimes on mondays I'm just too bushed to really want to get on
there. Sorry. 

If these are web-based chat rooms, in my opinion they suck compared to IRC.
IRC rocks! It's fast, it's easy and it's a blast !! My chat room is on
dal.net, channel #914chat. You'll see the porschefans web site in the banner.
