Rich,
You can change the cable yourself. Do you have a replacement cable yet? It
will require you to be inside your 914 as well as under it. 
I would have thought that someone had offered help by now since the mail was
so thin this week end. Sorry for the delay.

Jack up 914 and be certain it is safe. Use Jackstands.

Under the 914:
To remove the clutch cable.
There is a connection on the right foward side of the transmission that you
will have to disconnect that cable end is attached to. This is where the nut
screws onto the cable end threads. Measure the amount that this end
protrudes. Write it down for later use when installing new cable.

You will NEED a pair of vice grips to help hold the cable as you remove the
nut there at the cable end in above step.

Once this is loose, look rearward and you will see where the cable is guided
around a white nylon wheel. You will have to remove this wheel. There is a
large nut that is holding this in place. Make a note of the spacers location
you will see as you pull white nylon wheel off. Also make a note of the
white nylon wheel. It will need to be facing exactly how you see it NOW
before reinstalling.You may need to loosen some of the nuts that hold the
flange over part of the nylon wheel. Also make a note or diagram of how the
cable is routed from the 1st nut you removed at the cable end and as the
cable is routed to the firewall.

Inside the 914: You should use a drop light to see better.

Please Note:
You can see these below Illustrated in the Automobile Atlanta Catalog under
hard parts. There was a lot of time, money and effort that went into these
illustrations without cost to us 914 owners. These were done in a correct
view of their fitting order of use for us owners so USE THEM if you need a
picture to understand. This is true for almost everything on the 914 that is
a viable part in the 914 Auto Atlanta Catalog.
 
At the clutch/brake pedals assembly, you will see on the extreme right side
of it, a connection that looks like a link welded to a bar.
This is where the clutch cable is attached by a clip which is snapped over a
rectangle on the end of the clutch cable attaching point, holding this all
together.
Measure the amount cable end threads can be seen up to the nut. Loosen the
nut.  
Next loosen part which is like a rectangle by taking a small flat bladed
screwdriver and inserting it on the clip like piece that hold it to the rod
that is at the extreme end of the clutch/brake assembly.
Go lightly as you don't want to bend it out of shape (the clip) which you
will need to snap back on after screwing end of clutch cable to the amount
you measured earlier. 
Once clip is loose, screw rectangle piece off of cable end. Lay this and the
clip in a easy place to find when you need them later. In other words,
don't lose the clip or rectangle part.

Under the 914:
After you have done ALL of the above, under the 914 and in the 914. Go back
under the 914 to where the cable goes thru the firewall and pull it out
toward you to remove. Do not use excessive pulling force as it could be
catching on something in the center tunnel. Free it and then continue to
pull until it is out.

You will have to put new clutch cable in, but in REVERSE order of removal.

If you did not make notes and sketches, you may have it routed wrong and
this will break your new clutch cable if it binds. Check again to be certain
while under the 914.
 
Once you have everything back in place. You will need to have the clutch
adjusted. I recommend having this done by mechanic ASAP if you are not
certain how to adjust. Your adjustment will be good enough to get you there
to your wrench.

Thats it.

Hope I have helped. If you have questions, I will try to answer ASAP, but my
ISP server is generally tied up by other users between 1:00PM and 10:30PM so
be patient. I will get back as quick as I can.
