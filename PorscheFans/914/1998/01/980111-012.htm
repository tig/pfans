My experience is different, so I'll chime in on Yokohama A008RSs.  I've run
them as daily driver tires on a stock 914, a Mazda 323GT (turbo), and a Neon
ACR.  Except for winter driving (i.e., snow and ice), they were fine.  I got
at least 15,000 miles out of each set with autocrosses a dozen times a year.
Not great touring mileage, but good for the fun you can have at the drop of a
hat right around that next corner.  If you have a hunk of negative camber,
corners wear off the outside edges and straights wear off the insides, so they
wear evenly.  I did get a couple of long looks from cops, but no conversation
or tickets.
