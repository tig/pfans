Brian,

	One of the best ones I have found to work with the FI is the WEB
Cam for 2.0L it is as good as you can get and still run FI.

The WEB cams are heat treated so you will need to run their lifters, the
standard ones are too soft. I have found that buying their CAM, LIFTERS,
and a new gear (ALWAYS GET THE NEW GEAR), comes in about what a good
regrind costs and less than stock cam.

The WED cam moves the power band a bit so you get a 2500 - 5400 pull, if
you add the Kerby Hunter headers you will still be pulling when you hit
6K, but the oil cooler seals blow at 6200 so watch yourself (The MSD
with soft rev limiter will bail you out here).

BTW: Check your rule book fro changes you can make if you plan to race
the car. The SCCA book shows the max lift so make sure your cam gets you
there and no more! WEB can help you there also.


Best of luck

	Hi everyone,

	Happy New Year!  I seem to have missed the valve-train thread
due to digest
	problems


	Status report:  my 73 has a worn engine, so I'm building a 2.0
from several
	cores, re-using pistons, cylinders, etc, but putting in new
bearings, rings,
	etc.  I happened to be able to save one pair of heads--no
cracks!!  I've put
	in new guides but re-grinding the valves.  I am in the process
of polishing
	the exhaust ports, with a semi-competition valve job (3 angle
seats, 2 angle
	valves, 0.080" wide exhaust seats, 0.060 intake yada yada).
When the engine
	is built, I will do the swap and tear down the existing 2.0
engine for a
	future rebuild.

	The engine will be balanced and blue-printed, and running d-jet.
I've
	gotten to the point where I now need to choose a cam.  The old
one was *way*
	too worn to use.  Any suggestions?  I'm leaning towards the FAT
FI cam to
	run with my d-jet.  Is it possible to run anything stronger than
that, and
	still retain the FI?

	I'm also going to need lifters, new HD valve springs, etc.  Any
advantages
	with aftermarket pushrods, rockers, adjusting screws, etc?  I'm
told that
	911 swivel-foot-adjusters are the way to go, but don't fit in
2.0 rocker
	arms.  What about retrofitting rockers from a 1.7, and running
the 911
	screws?

	Can 2L rods be lightened?  What else do I need to do to make
more power?
	e.c. magazine says to put in ARP bolts, but I can't find a
listing for 2.0
	rods...are they the same bolts as the 1.7/1.8?

	Do headers *really* make that much power?  I don't want to lose
my heat, can
	a heater box be built around the KH headers?

	Thanks in advance.

	cheers, Brian Ng
