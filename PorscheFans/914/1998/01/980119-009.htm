I'm pretty sure that GT Racing has lexan. If I remember
right they have everything from lexan windshields to
rear quarter windows, acually they're a great source
for lots of light go fast stuff. I can't remember their
adress but they always have a little ad in thr back of
pano and excellence.

Hello all, Well I tore the right side inner longitudinal off this week end.
What a mess. Any sane person would probably find another 914, but what 914
owner is sane anyway! Ther is alot of rust and rot. This car will need lots of
new metal and fabrication. Any how this can and will be repaired. The deeper I
get into this car, make me think that this will be the autocross / track toy
and not the pristine GT replica that I intended it to be. I will save the
steel GT flares for a better 914.( I plan on having more than one 914!!!)  My
question to the list is about fiberglass GT flares. I would like to hear from
people who have or had them. Who did you buy them from, what was the quality,
fit and finish like, and how well did they hold up? 
Thanks,
Ed Villela
