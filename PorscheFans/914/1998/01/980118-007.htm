Tom,

It's unlikely the oil cooler blew out.  Much more likely the seals
have gone.  (I've run most of a valve train through an oil cooler,
and that didn't make it leak.)

If it's possible to replace the seals with the motor in, It's news to
me.  My experience is that you spend more time trying to figure out
how to do it with the motor in than it takes to remove the motor.

You're probably looking at $25 in parts, and 6 hours in labor.  If the
cooler really is gone, add $100 or so.

$.02,
Gary
