I would think twice about using 'O'rings from the hardware store.  As
far a I know they are buna n rubber and will not stand up to break
fluid.  I put a hydraulic clutch in mine and went around and around with
compatibility problems bequest the master cylinder wanted break fluid
and the slave I was using wanted hydraulic oil.  I finally went to
silicone break fluid which is inert.  Befoire I used an unkown material
I would soak it in the fluid for a few days to see if it swells up.  Or
get ahold of a catalogue like McMaster Carr that describes what 'O' ring
will work with what fluid.

Reading all the postings on the Monterey Historics today really caught my
attention
....Some time ago the Monterey Bay Region sent out the Order Form and Venue for
the August four day Historic Races.

I have already sent in my form and money for the event, which will include the
Friday night welcome party,t-shirts, paddoc parking for my 914-6, on the
concrete, not the dirt this year...I also made reservations in a hotel, but I
did that last august..most places are filled by now...keep checking...

I you are seriouss about going and not just wishing, contact the Monterey Bay
Region..David Kuhlmann at Kuhl912@aol.com
