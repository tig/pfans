Well, web sites don't fit on coffee tables for one thing, but anyway, it was
just a thoought.

Speaking of books, I received the "how to hotrod your VW" the other day and
have bee pouring over it at home. It's very interesting and yes, it's dated,
for sure. That SPG roller crank is really cool though. No coverage of Type
IV motors though, but a couple of mentions of the 411. The book is
disorganized also. There are helpful tidbits scattered in the strangest
locations. But, I've learned a few things so it was worth it.

Joshua: My car has the VPC unit installed and the condensor is located in the
front trunk. A rectangular hole was cut in the pan, the condensor placed in
and above the hole and a three inch wide steel strap goes over the condensor
(for and aft). I presume that the strap is to provide stiffening for the
missing sheet metal. Also, the spare tire mounts on top of the strap. Trunk
space obviously is decreased. I have never had any problems with structural
integrity and the unit still works fine after 23 years although I did have to
replace the receiver/dryer and the hoses when I took the car out of its 13
year sleep.
