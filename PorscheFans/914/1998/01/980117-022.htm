Hi Dirk!

 You asked:

   That's negative; the replacement O-rings in the G.P.R. kit are
square in cross section right out of the package.   Also, FWIW, the
problems of fit and material vs. fluid compatibility are not at issue
if a proper kit of parts is bought.   As long as you're going to do a
caliper rebuild anyway, you will need all the parts in the kit, and
some of them are not obtainable at the hardware store.

  Just my $.02 worth.

Brian,
Thankx for the info on Headlight aiming. I looked all thru the idiot book and
couldn't find the "formula" I used on the bus. I installed the Blue Halogen
H4's I got from AA today. They are 80/100's and I had 55/ 100's. What a
difference! Highly recommended (for street, not a racer like yours). I must
have some voltage drop without a relay and I'm sure the wires are getting
pretty hot, so I'll get that relay in asap, but even so, these blue lights are
very clear, crisp and lifelike. I imagine that oncoming cars figure they are
approaching a BMW or Mercedes. Do the new Porsche's have these---they should!
