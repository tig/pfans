I need the cooling flaps mechanism, thermostat & bracket, cooling cable &
pulley for a 1974 2.0L.  What I'd like to buy is the Impeller rear housing with
the cooling flap mechanism already mounted. I figure that by buying the
impeller housing with flaps stuff. I won't be missing any little parts.

I'm going to replace my leaking oil cooler seals, but it also appears that the
crankshaft oil seal behind the impeller hub is leaking too.  How do I remove
the impeller hub?  I tried gently prying behind with a screwdriver, but didn't
get anywhere.  What is the correct way to remove the crankshaft oil seal?

I'm going to replace the push rod tube seals too.  Where do I get "Viton"
seals?

Whew, I think that all my questions for now. Thanks in advance.
