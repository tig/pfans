Tuning what? That's a pretty broad topic.

Nope, no offense taken. :)

I do see your point though. Most of what I'm dealing with these days is
race prep and thinking up ways to wring more power out of a stock
engine. My 914 doesn't see very much street driving these days. Then
again, it's hard to see my 914 right now under a blanket of snow. :(

Geez, JJ should write a novel! Didjya get those injectors yet JJ? I'm
still looking forward to getting a chance to see the amazing phoenix
914, it's constantly rising from the dead. :)

My method? I read as many literature resources as I can, I ask a hell of
alot of question to anyone who will listen, and I poke my nose into and
under the car at every oportunity. I'm not a trained mechanic, just a
physicist. I find that the above techniques don't waste much money at
all. They can however become a great time sink. If you're relying on
your car to be available all the time, then mechanic money is sometimes
the better option. I havn't always been able to resolve my problems
myself. Usually it's either that I've been unwilling (too busy), or
unable (need expensive equipment) to solve it myself, that makes me turn
to a P-car mechanic.

That all depends on the problem I guess.

Change the fuel filter, and cut open the old one. If there's alot of
junk in the filter (brown rust) then it's time to pull the tank and
either get it cleaned and fixed or replaced.

Wow! A gift? You lucky dog!

First off, I'm an FI guy primarilly. My only personal carb experience is
with side-draft Mikunis on a Kawasaki. Amusingly enough, _they_ were
36mm too! But first and foremost, get a fuel pressure regulator. That
sounds like your fuel pressure is too high. It also sounds like you've
got a leaky carb. The 20 second period is probably because the gas has
either leaked or evaporated out of the float bowl, and it takes time to
refill. Once the bowl is full, the car will start just fine. But you're
probably running rich too. Check the spark plugs for fouling.

It would be a very good idea to clean the carb. If it sat for six months
or more, it's quite possible that the gas has varnished in the bowl or
jets and is adversely affecting it.
