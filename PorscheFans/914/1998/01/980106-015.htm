          Snow and the 914. Having gone to school in PA and owning a
          914 as an only car I can say I have recent experience with
          this. Is the 914 good in the snow? As Josh pointed out as
          long as the snow is less then 4-5inches the car will not
          high center. The problem I found was with 205 60s on the car
          there was not a lot of traction. the car would float over
          the snow ad spin the rear wheels and not go any where. I
          have actually gotten stuck in 2inches of snow on a dead flat
          road. The rear would spin and spin. They did not even dig
          down to the pavement. So I got some steel VW wheels with
          narrow 165s on them. The car would move but it felt like I
          was driving a hockey puck. The car didn't have a well
          defined front or rear it would just spin. This was great fun
          once you got use to it. 50 yards of opposite lock at 5mph.
          The car would spin at the drop of the hat. A slow turn
          sharply cambered road anything. I assume this is the nature
          of low pollar moment cars in the snow. They easily change
          direction. So I would say the 914 is bad in the snow but a
          lot of fun. Well maybe not so bad because once I put on
          narrow tires I never got stuck in less then 5 inches of
          snow.

          Wow this has gotten long. A passing thought to people
          looking for super wide tires. On the narrow tires in the dry
          the 914 was a blast. With less grip you could drift the 914
          around corners at much lower speeds. This allowed for more
          sporting driving at much lower safer speeds. The steering
          was also lighter and more communitive. In PA on back country
          Roads I could slide the car around corners 4 wheel drifts or
          just floor it and kick the tail out. With the 205s on the
          car on the street I never even squeal the tires on most
          corners because I would be going so damn fast it would be
          criminal. Also it might be a good idea for would be racers/
          drivers ed people to think about using lower grip smaller
          tires for there first days out. lower safer speeds more
          slides to learn to control in general a good idea in my
          opinion.

          Sorry for the ramble

          Nick
