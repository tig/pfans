First off, it's a state thing. So every state will have different
regulations regarding vintage plates. Check with your local DMV (or
appropriate agency).

But I can give a few examples...

Here in Colorado it's pretty simple. The car must be 25 years or older.
It must pass an initial smog check upon issuance of the vintage plate.
Following the issuance of the plate, the car will NEVER have to get
smoged again as long as you own it. In addition, registration is paid in
five year sums at $25/year. Pretty good deal if you ask me. No milage or
use restrictions.

Now for contrast... I checked in California vintage plates a while back
when I was told that it was 20 years that defined a vintage car. At the
time I checked, California's vintage plate laws were draconian to put it
politely. The smog issue was in debate at the time but when I asked,
smoging a vintage car was not required. However, you were limited to 500
miles a year, and the registration was expensive. So I said "then why do
it?". "For the vintage license plate." was the response I got. Geez... I
guess it was intended for concourse cars and garage queens.

So look into your states laws and regs to see if a vintage program
exists and what kind (if any) restrictions it places.

I can't wait untill 1999, then my 914 goes vintage and I can have a
fully developed race motor and injection and still be street legal!
Cool! :)

Hope this helps...
