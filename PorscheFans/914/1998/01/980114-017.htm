I am Mike Cooley, Memphis, Tn. retired industrial machinist. I am married
(37 yrs) to Annette who I met 40 years ago. We have a son, Mike Jr. & cat,
Katie.
My interests are my family, Porsche 914s, animals and anything else I don't
understand fully. So I guess that means I am interested in everything.

My life of 914 started in 1970. Mine was exactly what I wanted and paid for.
This is something I have problems with in this day and time. In the years
following 1970, I have owned various Porsche models. These include 20 914, a
74 Porsche 911 Carrera and 2 924s. The Carrera was too fast for my wifes
worried mind when I owned & drove it. I had given her the original 914 and
she "upgraded" to an 73 Cutlass Supreme so I lost track of the 914. I never
had one problem with the 1st 914 as long as we owned it. Beep Beep.

My present is a 1970 1.7 that was a gift.  

My 914. Its condition is medium. White with black tail, Chrome bumpers and
carb., new clutch, (4) new Defender HRX P195/60 set on Rivera mags.
Tail shifter that has been modified. Better word is butchered (Looking for
front shifter bar to repair). There is rust in the floor panel under my
driver side feet. Actually a big hole. Warmer weather will correct that. 
FI will be back in place as soon as spare funds turn up. Being retired has
those problems.

I have a heated garage. In the summer months only.

There are problems which need corrected. I am not a mechanic. I depend on
this list to help me overcome that. It is nothing that I am ashamed about. I
just never had to do mechanics before and I want to learn from the best
source avaliable, YOU, all the list users.

I never did any Autocross. There are not enough 914s in my immediate area to
fill the parking spaces my driveway could support. Driving fast on curveous
back roads is a passion that I enjoy when I have a good tracking 914 running
properly and safely.

My other hobbies are computers, graphic art, pencil portraits and
inventions. Teaching others how to build and use computers is the one that
takes most of my time. I do instructions to others at no cost to them.
Computers and I go back to mid 70s when it was still a vague word for most.

I enjoy e-mail as it gives me a sense of belonging.

Hope I fit in this notch, the 914 users of Porsche Fans.

Best to all of you.

Mike Cooley
Memphis, tn.
