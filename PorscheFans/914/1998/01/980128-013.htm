I know some of this has been gone over before, but with several email
program changes at work I've lost several archives and can't find  some of
the info I remember being posted.

When I got my FI system back, Ralph Ricks set up the timing with his D-Jet
tester, a pot in the Temp2 sensor line and a vacuum gauge.  Recently while
doing some work in the engine compartment I unintentially moved the dist.
so I want to reset the timing.  I adjusted the dist. by ear just to get it
close to an idle.

When I put my timing light on it, it was idling with about 20deg BTDC
advance.  Based on the Haynes book I rev'ed it to about 3500rpm and set it
close to the stock 27deg BTDC full advance.   It now drops the idle speed
too low to keep the engine running.  From the reading I've done on the DJet
system there are several things I could do and I'm not sure what is the
best way to go.

Engine info:

73 2.0L,  according to the PO it has a 'big bore' cylinder kit (96mm?)and a
slightly over stock cam (got car with carbs).  Now has the stock DJet setup
except for the following:  74 throttle body so no advance vacuum tap on it.
Cold start valve and decel valve are not currently hooked up.  No resistor
or pot currently in the Temp 2 line.  It was running fine after Ralph had
set it up when installing the system other than some idle hunting (expected
some of this due to the non stock cam).

I now have the dist set to 27deg total advance, I need to get it to idle,
even if high.  There is the idle bleed screw on the throttle body and the
pot on the ECU.  I could put a pot back in the Temp2 line.  Based on emails
all these could affect idle. So where do I start.  I could also get a vac.
gauge and try to set it like Ralph did, but can't find the archive of the
procedure.

Once I get this set I can be back on the road.  Got to get it running
reliably for the Laguna Seca trip in August.

Thanks,
Jeff
