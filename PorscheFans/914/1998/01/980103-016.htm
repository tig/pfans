If anyone is interested, I am in the process of designing a cooling
system using two 10 in electric fans mounted in a fiberglass shroud. 
This will replace the factory fan and shroud.  It should allow both stock
FI and carb systems to be used.  More importantly, the alternator will
not be lost.

I am going to do some cooling studies using individually placed
thermocouples between or on each cylinder (have not decided yet) with
both the factory setup and the electric fan system.  I will try to
correlate the cylinder temps with the oil and head tempatures.  It will
be a couple of months before I get the chance to try the new system out
but will let everyone know the results.

On to brakes.  I have a friend that has designed a 5 lug system for the
914 that uses 12 inch vented rotors 1 in which on the front, .8 in rear. 
Calipers are Wilwood superlites.  Custom hats are required as the
calipers are wider than stock calipers.  He has also designed a 5 lug
rear system using 911 parts on 914 trailing arm with the above mentioned
rotor/caliper combo.  This set up is not appropriate for street cars due
to the lack of a parking brake.  The estimated cost for this setup is
MUCH less than the Big Red conversion advertised by many companies in
PANO.  If you are interested in this setup for racing only purposes I
will put you in touch with this person.
