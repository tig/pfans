Ross:

A couple of comments that may or may not help, but I've been playing
with mixture and idle on my 2.0 with raised compression for over a year,
so this is not unfamiliar territory. Neither is it gospel:-).

1. The computer does not control idle, not directly anyway. It doesn't
control timing, for example, which can have a big effect. Nor does it
control the air flow. Assuming timing has not slipped, first examine the
air flow. The electrically-heated warm-up regulator mechanically
introduces more air to the manifold when it is cold. When the regulator
warms up, the engine idles on the air introduced around the throttle
plate by the idle bleed screw. Think of this as "base-line idle." Adjust
this first then find out what affect the warm up regulator, timing
advance, mixture, etc. have on cold idle. The idle air bleed screw is
hidden under the air cleaner on the throttle body. You can best reach it
by feel from the passenger side. Depending on your cold idle rpm, this
may be all you need. 

2. Try the above first, then if your idle when cold tomorrow is way too
high, like above 12-1300, then contact the list for further
instructions.

3. A lumpy idle when really hot, like after summer high-speed cruising
is usually caused by too rich mixture. If this is your problem, (in
January?) I found (with the use of an air/fuel meter) that you can come
pretty close to ideal by backing off the mixture knob on the computer
until the idle begins to hunt back and forth, then up a couple of clicks
richer.

4. The computer mixture adjustment knob doesn't affect the mixture all
that much. In other words, it has a very fine adjustment over a narrow
range. A 4-500ohm resistor or 0-500 ohm variable resistor(better)
connected between the head temp sensor and the computer will have a much
bigger effect on idle and idle mixture than the computer-top knob. But
don't go this route until you have looked at all the other causes.
