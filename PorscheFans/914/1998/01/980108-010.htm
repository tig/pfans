Mike has done a great job of getting the text of welding started.
 -and of course a little more esprit de keyboard wont hurt.

If I may be so bold as to add a few cents worth. . .

Mike did say to 'practice'. . .this is tantamount, but he neglected to say
that you should *test* your welds for quality along with the practice 
regimen.

Y'all must remember that to weld is to restore a metal sheet, or
structure to its original strength.  To attain that you must *penetrate*
the metal with arc heat in order to 'fuse' the metal parts into one.
 Try testing your welding practice 'coupons' by clamping them in a vise
and attempt to tear or bend apart the metal pieces at the weld joint.
This will teach you what is required to make welds that are as strong as
a single piece of metal.  ('metal' as in any welded metallic item)
As a further excercise, test these 'coupons' after grinding the weld beads
flush, as if they were panel welds awaiting body refinish.  This weakens the
joint and testing this will stress the importance of penetration in the weld 
zone.
  This is some cool manly stuff. . .making lots of noise and sparks and 
flame.

It is also possible to um, overdo it. . .like blow holes in your parts with 
too much
heat/loitering.  Its a balance to get it all right -wire feed speed, heat 
setting of
the welder, stinger angle and speed of your 'sweep', but then that is what 
the
practice will thresh out.  Familiarization with the welder will also come 
with
time. . .like when it is time to change the feeder tip, clean the gas 
nozzles, or
up the CFM gas flow.  It is also *very* important that the 'envelope' where 
the
arc occurs is maintained throughout the weld session as just a gust of wind 
or
breath is enough to disturb the protective environment created by the inert 
gas
(or wire core generated gas) that sustains the arc and prevents inclusions 
of
oxygen or whatever is in the air that spoils the weld puddle.
Nearby smoke coming off a dirty hot panel can also spoil your welds (see 
para below).

I would also highly recommend a prior thorough cleaning of any weld site 
because
*any* goobers nearby will cause disturbance (inclusions) in the welding 
process
that will pollute the quality of the weld and prevent the necessary fusing.
  Meticulous cleaning of both sides of metal is very important and since 
most of
these repairs are to rusty metal. . .rust really screws up welding with a 
MIG, so cut
the bad stuff out to where full-thickness-unrusted metal resides.
  I wont try to fool you that this work is easy or painless.  Get leather 
togs and a
skull-cap to keep your skin AND hair. . .btdt!  (:^)  was =:^)

I've also found that there is a difference in choice of tools for the job 
that can
make it easier.  Most notably, the eye shield/welding hood in use. . .I 
prefer a
"Jackson" with the *large* faceplate and vapor deposited *gold* eyeshield.
Not only do you get a wider field of view, but with the correct tinted 
shield
(sorry I dont recall #s offhand) you can actually see the worksite with the 
hood down
and protecting your eyes BEFORE you strike an arc (albeit with bright lights 

on the weld site).  This helps you avoid depositing heaps of steel in places 
you
dont want them -only to be ground off later -if you can reach them with the 
grinder.
This is purely up to the individual.  As with many things, it matters little 
what brand
the (car) welder is, it is the guy doing the (driving) zapping.

I shudder to think that while motoring a track, freeway, or accident -that 
the dude in front
of me has *welded* his rear swingarm, longitudinals, etc and then while 
under
stress, some part failed at the weld and caused a mishap.

Use these words at your own discretion. . .
The greatest revenge is that gained thru long life and prosperity.
