It took a while to loosen up the moving parts, but I was able to take a
drivers side mirror and put it on the passenger side. Lotsa liquid wrench. You
have to loosen the nut underneath accessed thru the baseplate. My 75 has the
nut plate welded into the door, but I have no idea how your supposed to drill
and tap from the inside! I measured roughly and drilled from outside with a
1/16" drill to help locate them. The screws are NLA--anyone know how to get
more chromeplated ones? The reason I'm switching to these is cuz my "stock"
mirror is not available anywhere. Anybody seen a mirror like this:
      Same baseplate as the usuals, but with a black plastic mirror assembly.
Square and larger than the chrome stockers. I've never seen another even in
the restorers guide or Long book.

     With all this talk of floor jacks, I wonder: Does anyone else use ramps
as often as I do? I rarely use the 2 ton floor jack--I always back onto the
ramps for any undercar work. Remember to block up a front tire  :)

I'm pretty sure there is a connection between the late model limited edition
plaid interior and the aforementioned bay city rollers  ; )
