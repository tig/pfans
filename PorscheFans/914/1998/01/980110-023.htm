Well I know that everyone dosent have personalized plates or want them,
I just meant I really hope all 544 wouldnt post, since I was going to
keep track of the plates and report back later, but hoped more would
come forward, since the Cristmas message didnt get them too.

Since it seems like more of us are trying to tackle the rocker rust devil, I
thought I would describe mine for John ,Karen and Brad and what I intend to do
to stop it. This is kindof long, so pass up if your not interested.

My passenger door will not pass the dd Big butt test or even the no butt test!
The door needs some serious muscle to open. The top squeeks like hell on the
right rear mount. There doesn't appear to be any problem with the suspension
mount. The battery tray is gone, I presume from rust. The motor support there
is intact. The lower edge of the firewall (outer) is full of holes (1"-3").
This appears to be caused by the water dripping down the rear window. The only
place this goes thru to the inner firewall is the lower corner behind the
passenger seat, which actually lets water in. I patched this with some bondo
over the summer as a stopgap measure until the big repair. The RR jack plate
is still workable (the square tube one) but the corner triangle is pretty much
gone. Unlike many cars in condition like mine, I have a beautiful trunk with
not a spot of rust ouside or in or under.
     The car runs great and everything works--good interior, newly rebuilt and
detailed brakes, stereo, etc. I believe it is worth the rescue. I don't have
that much in it ($1200) and I use it as a daily driver. I have yet to find a
better 914 available for the price, locally (seattle). 
     I've cleaned the junk from under the rockers by removing the three screws
that were rusted tight. Couple of pounds of crap in there. Driver side shows
no serious rust. I will install new rockers (fiberglass? ABS?), so I'll POR 15
or EXTEND the driver inner at that time.
As my friend and former boss runs a custom gate factory, he has volunteered to
donate a day or weekend to weld for me, if I do the grinding (which I did
there) and wire brushing. What I would like to do is:
    1. Use the "donated" steel from the gate shop and save the cost of buying
clamshells, if at all possible.
     2. Jack the car up with the door closed at the jack point with a floor
jack until the door gap is correct. With a piece of flat bar (about 18") on
the floor jack, the gap corrects under very light jacking.
     3. Weld a 1x1 or 1x2 in place from the front fender well to the rear over
the good existing metal, properly prepared. I am not after concours and the
rocker cover can hide any strange looking appendages.
     4. Weld some 20 gauge sheets over the properly prepared holes in the rear
outer firewell. 
     5. Weld a small 20 gauge piece behind the passenger seat on the inner
firewall. Back pad will cover this, along with the seat.
     6. Weld a new corner triangle for a good jacking point (those guys at the
tire place can be hell on VW's--I have horror stories from my 65 Bus!).
     7. Install new outer rocker covers--for cosmetics. Mine may be reusable,
but their bottom edge is pretty ugly.

Sounds like a plan.
PLEEZ---questions and constructive comments from anyone whos "been there, done
that....

It seems that the consensus is that our street driven 914's with stock fenders
should probably run 195/60 or 195/50's. These fit well on 2.0 alloys, Empi's,
etc.
There also seems to be lotsa good response to the Yokohama A509's as an
inexpensive, reasonably soft, quiet performance tire.
The competition:
Falkens---of which I have yet to hear anything positive, but in Seattle, at
least, comperably priced.
Nitto--very popular with the "import" crowd with their accuras and hondas. I
see them alot on front wheel drive asian imports with the big exhaust pipe, if
you know what I mean.  Nitto Xtreme is available in a lot of good sizes for us
(195/60, 195/55, 195/50, 205/50). Also in VR rating as well as H and S. Cool
looking directional tread patterns and about the same cost and availability as
the A509's.

Anyone running nittos? Pro or con? Better wet or dry? Quiet or Noisy?
Inquiring minds want to know.
