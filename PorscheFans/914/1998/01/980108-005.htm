>>TWO YEARS AGO I BOUGHT A 1971 PORSCHE 914. IT WAS THE FIRST 914 I EVER
BUY. WELL THE LICENSE REGISTRATION OF THE CAR SAYS :  VW 71<<

I have a 1970 914-6 that is titled as a 1969 914-6, this caused a
problem with my insurance company (value of car) because I had an
appraisal for a 1970 914-6 . When I tried to get the state to change the
title they told me that I had to bring the car to someone to check it
out and make sure they were changing it to the correct year, there would
be a fee of course. I informed them that Porsche did not make a 1969 914
model and that I had a factory certification that the car was built in
April of 1970. They told me I still had to bring it in to be checked
out. Finally my insurance company accepted my argument and use the value
of a 1970 914-6.
My car is still registered as a 1969 model.
The moral of the story is that any DMV person can miscode a title and
then it take an act of congress to change it!

BTW: I have a 1970 914-4 that has a 6 for the number of cylinders, but
its only a 4.
