     Sounds like you have the wrong kit.   If you didn't buy it from
GPR, it's probably not correct (or you paid too much) or both.  I
bought kits from 2 FLAPS as I recall,  because I was in a hurry, but
neither was correct, so I ended up taking them all back and ordered
from GPR. There is no place in the caliper that I can remember using
any 1" O-rings.  The adjuster O-rings are REALLY tiny (about 1/4 inch
in diameter, with a cross section that can't be much more than .015"
or so...), and do come in the kit from GPR.   There should also be a
pair of fluid channel O-rings... you will need to replace these if
you split the calipers.  These have square cross sections about 1/16"
on a side, with a diameter of about 3/8", as I recall.   The GPR kit
has all these O-rings, plus a new pair of dust excluder boots.

  Steve Malm of this list wrote the following one day... you might
try it:

  "    found a penetrating oil at Pep Boys that is awesome.  The can
is
so cluttered it is hard to tell the name, but I think it is PB
Penetrating Catalyst.  The can looks like a joke but this stuff
works.  Used it
on engine sheet metal screws that I figured would have to be drilled
out, and within 15 miniutes I could loosen them with a standard
screwdriver.  It also had the same effect on the lower rocker panel
screws...   "

   Other than this, I would suggest mounting the caliper firmly in a
vice in such a way as to minimize the bending stresses on it, which
may cause it to break, and use an impact screwdriver to turn your
torx bit.   Craftsman used to sell these... I don't know if they
still do or not, but it is an invaluable tool.   It is a cylinder
about 2" in diameter and about 6" long, which ends in a 1/2" square
drive.   It comes with an adapter to allow screwdriver bits to be
attached to it.   You apply torque with your hand in the direction
you wish to turn the thing, and beat on the top of it with a hammer. 
 If this doesn't get it loose, throw the caliper away (or send it in
as a core and buy a rebuilt one from Automotion) 'cause it ain't
never gonna come apart!
   In any event, I would NOT suggest applying heat to the caliper in
any way.   As I said before, I have not figured out how to
dissassemble the rear adjuster, and there may be some rubber parts
associated with the self-adjustment mechanism.   If you apply heat,
you may ruin all of the rubber, which means that you will have to
dissassemble the thing to piece parts to find it all and replace it.

 I hope this is of some help.

					Good Luck,
                                                            Jim T.
