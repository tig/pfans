I heard about that. I used to live in Portland, and I remember the
occasional ice storm that would blow in. It was totally awsome!
EVERYTHING was covered in ice. The whole city would shut down
completely. Here, it snows 4 feet and things pretty much keep going
on...

Neat, I'd love to see it. I have a couple of pics of my 914 and Syncro
as barely distinguishable lumbs of white. I'm not kidding, you could
sortof tell that the Syncro was there, but the 914 was barely
recognisable as a lump in the surface of the snow. I'm sure glad I
double cover the car. I really wish I had a garage.

Excelent! Another satisfied customer! Isn't it great to drive a
thrilling, affordable, unique sports car. Puts a grin on my face every
time I climb in! :)

> Don't we have da coolest rides or what?!

You said it Toby! I'm sortof dreading the day that the 914 evolves into
a track-only car. At that point I guess I'll just have to go out and get
another one eh? :)
