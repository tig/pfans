Yes, they do.

OK, here's the deal. Both the Bavaria and 2002 calipers are 4 piston types.
HOWEVER, each opposing pair of pistons in each caliper are on a different
fluid circuit. So there are 2 brake lines going to each caliper. You have to
figure out a way to get fluid to both inputs. They are completely separate
circuits. BMW does dual circuit differently. One set of pistons in each
caliper are connected in one citcuit, and the other set are conected with
the rear brakes to form another circuit. That way, unless you loose both
circuits, you will always have front brakes. I'd hate to try and stop a car
with only rear brakes. Hope this helps.
