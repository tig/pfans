Keith,
You may have already done this by now, but...
Replacing the intake runner boots was my holiday project also.
Not familiar with the L-jet, but on my D-jet, I removed the
intake pipes at the head, cleaned all and used new gaskets.
Pretty easy to get everything off, but had to loosen engine
sheet meal a bit to ensure new gasket at head seated properly.
I put the boots on the air intake distributor first then
put the runners on - easy. I used just a light film of hi temp
sealent on the boots.
Time spent including spit shine on all was about 8 hrs, but
I wasn't in a hurry (2 weeks off with new garage).
All those sharp edges are kinda hard on the hands though.

I also replaced the ball joints - I had to beat the h*ll
out of the speader to get the old ones off. Use something
larger than a 2 lb hammer, wear leather gloves and knot a towel
around the end of the spreader to protect your hand - my left
thumb still hurts where I smashed it. Finally got the left
side off using a two handed swing between the legs (no wisecracks here
please).
My advice: unless you have air tools, just pay someone to do it.
A question for the gang - How much play should the inner tie rod
have with the ball joint removed. I could move it side to side about
an inch with only gentle pressure. Does that seem okay or do I need
to replace them also?

Happy new year all.
