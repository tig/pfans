Andy-

 I think cheesy is a hard word, I think what Stan was after with the
combo gauge, was looks, silver dot, original type and would look more at
home is a 914 dash (read stock looking) as appossed to a late model
Turbo tach with a different gauge in the bottom (read after market look)
 But to each his own....
