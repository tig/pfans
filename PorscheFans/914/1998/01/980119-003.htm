Why waste time and frustrate yourself searching for the proper o rings
when we have thousands of them on the
shelf?  Proper composition and size for both the caliper halves and the
adjusters.  We also have the adjusters and
the improved inner adjuster cover.
   I do not usually respond to the list when I see bad advice or lack of
knowledge as to what is available because
good information and corrections seem to quickly be forthcoming.  This
o-ring discussion is becoming tedious
though.  Years ago in our own frustration that the factory did not
provide a rear caliper rebuild kit, we went
through hundreds of ATE caliper kits and found some obscure Saab kit
that had the same size boots and piston
o-rings.  We then had the four other seals made by a high tech seal shop
(along with 400 degree viton push rod
tube seals), added some instructions and were in business.  Later, after
contacting ATE and getting the response
that no caliper hard parts were available at any price, we had the inner
and outer adjusters made. We thin found a
suitable c clip and inner adjuster plug The result?  No rear 914 caliper
is not rebuildable (within reason of course!)
