What's the length of stock connecting rods for the 2.0L.  Reason - I
have a set of 5.5in Pauter rods which I'm going to use with a set of 
custom forged pistons from Air-Cooled Classics (9.5:1 CR and bore 
between 98mm and 100mm predicated on piston ring availability).
The piston pin height will be raised as close to the oil control ring
as possible (anybody know the minimum distance?).  The pivotal
question (this is a DOOZY) is:

    Given the maximum piston wrist pin height what is the Maximum
stroke that can be used with 5.5in rods without shimming the cylinders?

An UNeducated guess will have following spacing:

   1.  6mm between the crown and the 1st compression ring
   2.  1.5mm width for the 1st compression ring
   3.  2mm between 1st ring and 2nd ring
   4.  1.5mm width for 2nd ring
   5.  2mm between 2nd ring and oil control ring
   6.  3mm width for oil control ring  
   7.  4mm between oil ring and top of piston wrist pin.

For a grand total of...drum roll please.....20mm - a humble and 
hopefully understandable picture follows:
____________     <----crown
[               <----6mm
  [             <-------------1.5mm 1st comp ring
[               <----2mm space
  [             <-------------1.5mm 2nd comp ring
[               <----2mm space
  [             <-------------3mm oil control ring
[               <----4mm space
         (   )  <------------piston wrist pin
       
Is this off the wall?  Can this spacing be crunched or does it need 
to be expanded?  The purpose of this engine will be streetable 
auto-x with a flair for longevity.  The heads are port/polished 2.0L 
MSHP with heavy duty single springs, stainless steel valves (stock
sizes) and Pauter machined needle-bearing rockers.  The crank will
be a counterweighted steel crank from Otto's.  Air-Cooled Classics
is supplying a solid lifter cam with a boasted range of 2500-6800
RPM's.  40mm DRLA's with 6in K&N air filters (housing 4in and
5in filters).  Ignited by a MSD 6AL, distributed by Bosch 009 with
Compufire.  Overall, it should be a pretty nice piece of work.

Thanks in advance for any help answering these questions - i'm in 
digest mode so it may take me awhile to respond to any comments.

Have a great day..........
