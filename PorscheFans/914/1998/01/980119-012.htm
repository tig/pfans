Hi gang,

Andrew has some excellent points (as usual) about the Chalon kit,
but I thought I'd add a couple more:

The instruction manual says you can install the kit and be ready for
paint in about 40 hours.  This is a crock.  I bought a completed
Chalon 914 many years ago from an apprentise bodyshop guy.
It looked very good - just a couple hairline cracks here and there.
It took him 300 hours to build it....just a wee bit more than the 40
recommended by the manual.

I enjoyed the car for a while then destroyed it by flipping it through
some trees at 60mph.  The mere fact that I survived with only a small
1/4" scar on my little finger made me want to buy another 914 and
create the Chalon look again.  So I did a lot of research....

According to all the fiberglass experts I talked to, you will pretty
much
ALWAYS get small cracks due to the different expansion rates of
fiberglass and metal - especially in a fluctuating climate as mine
in Western Canada.

After my experience installing the front half of the Chalon kit (and
some other fiberglass for other projects), I have to say the Chalon
kit is very well thought out and fits quite well - although it has flaws
too.  The "generic" parts out there that I've seen really suck.  They
are so bad that I've actually thought about using some of the thin
sheetmetal I've got in my garage and getting a shot bag and some
mallets to form my own parts....that's pretty desperate!!!!  :-)

No, my car isn't done yet.  It's looking mighty "rough" right now.
I've only put about 40 hours into it and it shows.  The front end is
installed but not blended in.  I can see how 300 hours will probably
be the number for me too...
