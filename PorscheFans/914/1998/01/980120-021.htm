Noticed the same thing on the rental car my friends and I had in England
last year.  Seemed like a very cool feature, you could adjust it depending
on how loaded the car was.  We figured it was DOT regs or something,
afraid the typical American wouldn't be able to deal with it and they'd be
out of adjustment all the time then someone would sue because they couldn't
see and hit something, etc.

Hi Dave,
     When I was over in Italy during x-mass, I rented a Maxim (yes I know
Jap car in Europe), and it had a switch for light height. It had 5
positions
and it raised the beams. I checked out the system and it was a stepper
motor
connected to the rear of the light box which raised or lowered the back of
the box. The front was hinged so the unit changed angles.
I asked a friend who lives there and he was suprised American cars did not
have this type of control, seems all the mid to upper cars have it over
there.
