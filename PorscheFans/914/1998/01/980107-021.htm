>>Say, the 914 was supposed to be pretty good in snow, isn't it?  I
recall
seeing at least one ad for ski racks, etc.  Just throw on some studded
snows, and off you go! =8^)<<

Nope the 914 is actually a pretty bad snow car.  Why do you ask, well it
goes like this the equal weight distribution and realitive lite weight
make the rear tires have very little bite.  I have some picts some where
of a car test with a 914 trying to get across snow ( that was the test)
and the picture shows two people sitting in the rear trunk inorder to get
enough bite to make the run.  A 911 or VW has us beat in the snow big
time.  BTW, in this test they also had a Ghia which was the best snow car
they tested.

Of course you can make a 914 go in the snow or ice, slap on a set of
narrow rims and Great SNOW tires, studs are a must in some areas, and run
with it.  But Mike don't you have a big 4x4 pickup truck?

Or you do what Josh did and get a quattro or syncro and have a blast.

Take care,
