Ralph Rick had written the reply below and I'd saved the message.

I bought my project car last Jan, with carbs.  Luckily the PO had paid tags
through Dec 97.  I started the transfer, paid the fees at the DMV.  Just
needed the smog check to finish.  But I had current tags so I could go on
the street with little chance of getting stopped.

In July I bought the stock FI system from and got installed by Ralph R.  I
knew that the Dec 97 registration would be the bi-annual check anyway so
decided to wait till then so I wouldn't have to do 2 checks.  Had a bout of
shiprights disease so in Dec the car wasn't mobile so I went and paid the
reg fee.  Asked about the impact of SB42 and was told to get the last smog
check then no more.  After that I saw Ralphs message.

This week I was at the point, with expired tags, of needing to get a moving
permit to get the car over to my mechanic friend for a tune up and trip to
the smog station,  I went to the DMV but first asked about 'this law I
heard about where 73's don't need smog' like Ralph mentioned.  Even though
I've got the stock FI system, the PO had a non stock cam in and I was
afraid that even if it would pass - one screwup by the smog tech and
instead of free and clear I could get dumped into the gross polluter
catagory.

Even though I've got a thick stack of forms and partially completed
transfer the DMV lady didn't even blink.  "Nope, you don't need to do it."
Then she dumped all the forms, said I'd get the title in 30 days, and gave
me the 98 tag.  SCORE.  No more smog checks.

Thanks again Ralph,
Jeff

When the fees and smog check were due on my '73 in November, I paid the
fees, but parked the car until I had a chance to do some tuning in
preparation for the smog check.  Since our knowledge of the law was
unclear, and since it was so close to 1998, my son went to the DMV to
ask the above questions.
They answered by giving him the '98 sticker.
Cheers,
