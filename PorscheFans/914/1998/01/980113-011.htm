List members: This is my personal opinion, a summary.

I am fully aware that this list is basically a means of daily communications
between 914 owners by e-mail. All I write is probably seen as wasted band
width by the majority. I am proud of one fact. It is I who asked at
Christmas 1996, for 914 owners to get to know each other. It is still
working as the mail at Christmas, 1997 shows. Many did not participate to
something as simple as introducing themself. Big question. WHY?
 
My excuse: I rejoined the list again after being off the list for 8 months
and was not aware until it had closed. The post was on Dec. 5,1997. 

I feel that the majority of persons using this list are more inclined to set
at their screen and just read what a very few others venture than stand up
and toot. Tooting makes owning a 914 easier for everyone on this 914 list.

If we look back at the content of messages since the day this list was born,
we will discover that there is good information, but has very few subjects.
These subjects are more related to about 10% of the users that are
constantly discussed, again and again, while the other 90% remain virtually
invisible. 

Do people have fear of participating because they feel that others will
think they are beginners? So what! Just jump in. I have no fear myself
because I really don't care what others think of me when it comes to my
learning something new.

It should be understood that nobody is tooting their own horn. Just trying
to help others with a simple, step by step process that shows others they
can do things if they just try. Some documents, written singularly, NOT part
of numerous e-mail postings, include in clear steps, how to do it, by list
members Dave Darling, Jim Thorusen, Ralph Ricks, Tim Jones, Dr. 914, Kyle
Ehler, Andrew Kalman and others I could catch flack about not mentioning.

A newcomer, to my eyes, who is destined to write good clear procedures is
John Dunkle. He is providing 1st hand information that is exceptionally
bright and easy to follow. While John is doing this, he still expresses
desire to learn more by asking questions. Many others show abilities as they
go thru their own learning experience. 

To name a couple. Josh Hadler and Dirk Wright. A suggestion, step by step,
of how you, as an owner of a 914, determined what process you use for tuning
the 914. I was there when you came aboard back then. You need to tell us
what you did, how you determined what needed to be done and what you did on
the initial issue of tune up and just getting baby to run decently. Make it
a singular document that we can fetch from mail and print to store in our
own VIP files at home. Sure, Haynes has that but a real 914 person aspect is
much more concise since manuals assume all readers are mechanics. Again, I
am sure I will catch flack about not mentioning others.

Tips. A request by Demick Boyden for tips. He volunteered to compile these
and make them avaliable for all of us. Response has been poor. Come on. Its
your list so get it moving. Tips are anything that you do that makes owning
a 914 easier by doing so and sharing with us all. If Dr. 914 could come up
with 700, I am sure that 544 others can find a few more.

FAQS. John Dunkle made a generous offer to the list concerning posts and
their translation into html files which would benefit all of us. He has said
he would set up a server for this purpose. That is an expensive personal
gift that may pass if we don't jump on it. If I had any knowledge about HTML
I would volunteer, but I don't. Again there is lack of follow thru in
general unless this was done by private mail. I assume that no one has
volunteered to accomplish this. We need this so if anyone has the ability,
please find time to help.

Not wasting bandwidth I assure all of you.

Best regards.

Mike Cooley
