The most accurate statement is that the high intensity discharge lamps =
emit more green and blue light than do filament lamps. I don't think you =
can say the light is purer. If you looked at a frequency distribution of =
wavelengths from a HID lamp, it would be very ragged - big peaks for =
some wavelengths (colors) and far less for others. Light from a filament =
lamp (including halogens) shows a smooth broad peak, much like sunlight, =
but centered closer to the red/yellow wavelengths than daylight. =
'Halogen' lamps are filament lamps designed to run at higher =
temperatures to emit more light at the blue end of the spectrum, but =
they are still a  long way from sunlight.

>The new headlamps are not  really blue in color as much as conventional
>headlamps that we are all used to are just very yellow.  The purer =
light
>just appear blue in comparison.
