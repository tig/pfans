Yesterday, I woke up with the strangest rash from the waist up. Since I
didn't know what it was, I went to the hospital, where they didn't know
what it was either. I spent a good 5 hours there feeling really sleepy and
a dull headache. I still have the rash today.

The rash cut my playtime with the 914 short :(

I was fiddling around with the new flywheel and pressure plate bolts I got
from M&MCC. They didn't have the oem style flywheel bolts in fine thread,
only coarse. So, I bought some grade 10.8 hex head bolts of the correct
length and bought some  ribbed cup washers. These bolts take a 19mm socket
as opposed to the 17mm of the oem. I did a test install to make sure
everything cleared ok. Looks good so far. I also bought some grade 12.4
(the highest generally available) socket head (takes an Allen tool) bolts
and special lockwashers for the clutch pressure plate. I chased the threads
in the flywheel with a tap, since they were a little narly.

New hardware is really cool.

BTW, I can't find a spec on the wear limit for clutch discs. Anyone have a
number? I'm certain mine is near the limit, so it will be replaced.
