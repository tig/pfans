To the list:
I was looking thru my webber carburetor manual, hoping I could supply some
information about the IDF venturi diameter someone was chatting about
earlier today. I found nothing.
Now, the reason for this post.
Looking at the list of vehicles and the Webbers that used original equipment
jet setting for a lot of different cars, I just noticed under the Porsche
line of cars, there was listed a Porsche 904 GTS Carrera.
Anyway the carb listed as original for the 904 was a Webber 46 IDA 2/3
This 904 was a 4 cylinder with 1956 cc engine. Why the 40 IDF on 914?
Anyone out there ever try this carb or know anything about its suitability
for a carbureated 914 2.0?
Not for me. I have a 1.7 but the list may like some input on this Webber.

Very curious!
