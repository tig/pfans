Hey Ironworkers;

   I'm one of those guilty of using an el-cheapo MIG welder and
now that mine has 8+ years of heavy use, it is showing its age.
  It starts with poor wire feed, like intermittent.  The problem
is the size of the roll of wire you use.  I really like the 9 pound
spool, but these are so heavy and the cheep MIGs are poorly
setup for this type of load -it can cause poor wire feed.
  This can really screwup your welds, so beware.

  Another cause of crummy welds is slag buildup in the nozzle.
 -particularly when doing inverted position welding. . .
Sometimes causing a short to the stinger nozzle, causing the thing
to become electrically 'hot'.  If you weld like I do, you
occasionally touch the nozzle to the work, causing a temporary
short circuit.  The globs of steel shorting the nozzle robs
your weld of heating current or at least disrupts the uniformity
of the gas envelope, and can screwup your welds. . .beware.

  So the moral of the story is:
  Keep your schoz clean; use a nozzle protectant such as
   "spatter-pruf" (avoid silicone gunks and sprays) and pick
   out the spatter globs that accumulate in the nozzle.
  Prepare weld site and vicinity to bare metal clean as possible.
  Keep on hand spare parts such as nozzles, tips, rollers, and
   maybe a hoze.
  Tip: add to your machine a ball bearing setup such as a
   'lazy susan' to aid the wire spool in moving freely (in
   horizontal orientation) as the plastic arrangment will wear out,
   causing less than smooth feed and rough welds.

  For those doing inverted position welding:
  Use your leathers, gloves, skull cap and chaps, or at
  least cotton jeans and . .socks.  Even then molten
  droplets will sneak in and pock your hide.  'dance boy dance'
  Use a protective shield over your hood's viewscreen to
  protect the shade coating and ensure UV eye protection.
  Keep a fire extinguisher within reach.
  Avoid inhaling welding fumes, thus 'fume fever'.
  Avoid migging in drafty locations (gas mig).
  <do penetrate deeply>  =:)

  Do *NOT* use 'weld thru' coatings in vicinity of welds.
 -for high-current stick welding its probably ok, but for
  our low-amperage stuff, -it wont work.
