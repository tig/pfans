Attention 914 wannabe ironworkers. .
I'm gathering up some of my old posts from 'porschephiles' to update
folks that are relatively new on the list and are, or thinking of getting,
into a rustoration of the 914.

 -----------------------------
  In reviewing some of my books on body repairs, I realized how much
unwitting quotation from them I have made.  I have one really good book and
another that adds depth to understanding the art of welding.  Since we are
in the season of more work on than driving The Porsche . . .

  I hereby humbly offer the following:

(1) 'The Principles of Auto Body Repairing and Refinishing' by
Deroche & Hildebrand
  cost:  approx. $35 U.S.  700 ppgs  (please note this is a shop study text)

(2) 'Welder's Handbook' by  Finch & Monroe
  cost:  approx. $15 U.S.  150 ppgs?

   In "The Principles . . ." book you will find the first 200 pages to be
chocked full of the bodywork skills many Porschephiles will need to rustore
a car, literally word for word.  In addition to the bodywork portion there
are sections on TOOL selection and usage, shop setup, fiberglass repair,
refinishing and plastic repairs.  This is a big 'bang for the buck' text.

  In the "Welder's Handbook"  you will find a short dissertation on most
types of welding technology; Mig, Tig, Arc, Oxyacetylene.  There is
information on methods of using the welding equipment in different
situations and materials.  This handbook goes into slightly more welding
detail than 'Principles . . .' as the scope is broader and the setup and
use of the equipment is presented in greater depth.  Very little mention of
bodywork in this book, but great if you are just starting an interest in 
welding.
I've slogged thru 'Audel's' volumes on welding, and this handbook sums
up and updates in a dense form, the knowledge found in them.

  With these two books and a *lot* of practice and resolve, I went from
neophyte to 'semi-pro'.
