Dirk,
I like them too. Have owned several with 4 carb setup. Nadar didn't like the
earlier models. Stigma followed all until manufacture was halted. The
problem was corrected by GM because of Nadars' early Corvair.
Fantastic engine once the seals are replaced by vinton. Look around. You can
find reasonable price. As you said, very versatile to repair. 
Sell the BMW and get a dozen engines. Make them all up and sell as a easy
install. Then you can get a real 914/6. Of course the buyers will not have a
genuine 914/6 but they will have one fast machine if that is their goal.

These are my opinions only. Yours may differ. 

Damn, As a free thinker, I just had to say this below.

Speech police not needed as they must be busy leaning heavy on our
President's removal with heresay and wild accussations. Conviction before a
trial is UnAmerican. I am not a Clinton fan, but he is The President.
Press and TV Networks will eventually control everything under the guise of
"freedom of the press". :-(
They create the News, not just report the News since Nixon.
