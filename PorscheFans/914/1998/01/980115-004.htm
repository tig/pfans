I have a friend who is interested in buying a '73 or '74 914 2.0 and is
willing to spend somewhere around $5,000. This should put him in
position to buy a great example of this car. No rust, rebuilt engine,
well maintained, vgc interior, etc. I am aware that AutoAtlanta claims
to be the ultimate source for a good 914, and have heard that they have
a wide variety to choose from, but I want to check with the experiences
of this group to confirm or deny this.
What experience have you had with them? 
Also, even if you have no experience with them, you may have another
good source or have one for sale yourself. Any pertinent experience or
info would be appreciated.

Thanks very much in advance,

Nathan Fornwalt
