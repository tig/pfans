You probably only need the outer part of the inner rocker, if that makes
sense. 90$ I think.

Since the car is already bent, take it to a frame shop and let them twist
it back. Weld in some braces to hold it straight. Flat bed the car to your
buddy's welding shop. Driving a car with weakened structural members will
twist it in strange ways. Also, using the door gap as a guide may not
insure that the rest of the car is straight, since the door is adjustable.
The door may have been adjusted before you got the car when it first
started to sag. The only correct solution in my opinion is to take it to a
frame shop.

That may strengthen it, but it's no substitute for replacing the outer part
of the inner rocker.

As long as you cut out the rotten metal first, this shoudl be fine.

Those Scotch Brite rotary pads are great for removing paint and rust prior
to welding. Use 3M's Weld Through Coating on the mating surfaces of both
parts before welding.
