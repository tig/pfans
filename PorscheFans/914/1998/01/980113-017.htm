As one mostly-silent member, I'd just like to thank all of those who do
keep this list alive. I don't know of anywhere else on this planet that one
can find this kind of info on our favorite car. It's kind of hard to
contribute much to the group when your car's on blocks, the engine's on the
floor, and big chunks of body are rust piles on the ground below it, tho. :(

With the help of another Mid-Ohio PCA member (hi, Mike), I'm trying to get
some of the local (Central Ohio) 914 owners together for an informal,
stick-your-nose-under-the-hood, get-your-hands-dirty,
learn-more-about-your-car session for the 914 owners in the area. Anyone
else interested in traveling to Columbus Ohio is welcome to attend, just
let me know if you are interested. Think of it as another strike against
cabin fever this winter. No firm date set yet.

Hi all, I've seen several posts on this subject. I as well am a victim of
longitudinal rust. I did not realize how bad it was until last nite after I
dropped the engine and trans and had the car way up in the air. It's not bad
enough to scrap the car, but more than the average enthusiast can handle. I
have 17 years autobody experience, I weld well, fabricate metal well and do
lead work. I can repair this car. The point of this message is that in most
cases these cars can be repaired by do it youselfers. I will post the progress
and steps as I do this if list members are interested. There were some very
good posts on mig welding recently, if your doing metal repairs, read them. Do
not attempt structural repairs with brazing. It not safe or reccommended. Now
as for longitudinal repairs, don't use angle iron or fence post. The
longitudinals are boxed sections that offer strength to the whole chasis. If
you just repair holes in the bottom, the center and tops could be weak or thin
from rust on the backside. Replacing the whole piece restores the orignal
strength or close to it. STUTTGART AUTOMOTIVE (937) 435-4541 sells inner
rockers for $68 each. Very reasonable. Buy them.If you would like some really
nice heavy duty repair pieces, contact Brad Mayeur. It takes longer to replace
the whole section, but you will have a safe solid 914 that will last along
time. Plus you can clean and paint the inside with rust paint while its apart.
When installing new piece, spot or plug weld with your mig in all of the stock
locations. Start in the middle, then do each end. Alternate often and allow
lots of cooling time so that you don't have warpage. I mean it, take your
time. I appologise for the long post, but I felt it was justified. List
members feel free to contact me if you have questions. 

Thanks
