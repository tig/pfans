I think this is a great idea.  The biggest weakness of this list is that once
information and advise is given, its gone (or at least would be VERY hard to
find).  How many times per month do the same questions get asked about someones
high idle condition, or what size tires and rims will fit under stock or flared
fenders? There are two major locations on the web that I know of that already
 have technical info and procedures which people have documented (Tims 914 fan
web page and the Renegade 914 page). I think that as a group we should
concentrate on expanding these libraries of info and procedures.

In addition to entire procedures, there are many good tips that people have
come up with.  We should start a list of 914 tips (one liner kind of things)
similar to what AA has done. I'm sure that with the knowledge and experience in
this group we could create a tip list far more extensive than what AA has done.

I'll take the first step by starting this tip list.  Please send me any 914
tips you may have (demick@engr.sgi.com).  I'll compile them into a list and
make sure that they get published on the web in one of the above listed pages.
 It will be a 'living' document that can be continuously updated as tips come
in.

Like Mike said.....  If someone else does it, you can do it if you have a guide
and are willing to learn.  That is what this list is all about.
