Bill,

A couple things to look for. If the idle is rough the jets could be dirty
or the carbs are out of sync. All the jets are stacked under the emulsion
tube on top of the carb. They are the tall screw in hollow thingys.
Unscrew, take apart, blow out, check and put back in. If that cures the
problem get a new set of fuel filters (I use the clear bullet type for
VWs. About a buck apiece).

If everything is clean and it is still running rough you will need to
sync the carbs using a unisyn guage. You do this by making both carbs
open at exactly the same time. So the linkage will have to be adjusted to
make it run better. A unisyn guage measures the amount of air being drawn
thru the throat at idle. Ideally each throat will read the same.

One other thing to check are the idle mixture screws on the outside of
both carbs. There should be 4 of them, one for each throat. Screw them
all the way in and then back them out until you get max idle. Do this one
at a time until it runs at the highest rpm.

Ahem, once you get the carbs dialed in you will be amazed how simple and
trouble free carbs can be.

My son just got his own 73 914 2.0L. It has Delartos and is running
rough. Does anyone have at least a diagram of these carbs so I know what
is what? I am a FI person myself
Thanks in advance
