 I'm a little confused by this one... the knob that you speak of is
for emergency deployment of the headlights in case of motor or other
electrical failure... it has nothing to do with aiming.   Position of
the headlights is a function of the adjustable mounting screws for
the motorized assembly, adjustment of the motor travel limit
switches, and adjustment of the headlight aiming screws.

  I believe that a replacement knob could be fabricated from some
aluminum stock, with a hole drilled in the center and threaded to
take the male thread on the end of the motor shaft, but I have not
actually done it.

   I hope this is of some help.
