HOWDY Eddie and listers,
 
The front end is easy...
1) unbolt 914 front end.
2) bolt in 911 front end or
3) just use 911 A-arms only and retain 914 cross member.

also 19mm master is a good idea while in there.

The rear.
1) restud hubs for 5 lub (cheap, easy, works great) Some will say use
only early hubs because of embossment in hub, but it really dosent
matter, yes it may be stronger, but have never even heard of late hub
failure.
2) 914-4 caliper with 9146 rotor or
3) 914-4 caliper/spaced with 911 vented rotor with turn down outer
diamiter.
4) 308 caliper (almost same as 914-6 caliper) with 911 vented rotor.
5) 914-6 caliper with 914-6 rotor. Good luck with finding the 914-6 or
308 for a good price, if at all.
6) Early 911 up to Carrera rear caliper and vented rotor "WITH" 911
E-Brake assembly bolted to stock 914 trailing arm and custom made
E-brake cables. This dose work, havent hear it on the list before, have
seen it done by my mechanic a few times and other than the cables it
boltd right up and works like stock. You can call my Mechanic (909)
981-5843 (I think thats it) This is the route Im going with Carrera
calipers and rotor's.

Eddie, I know Motormeister was written up in the mag and I have been too
there old shop and new one, I dont really know the price of there six
conversion kit, but knowing the owners, Lee and JR I wouldnt. Ive heard
a few things about them, I've been in the back when Jaun or Poco was
taking apart a 911 motor and was asking questions that ANY engine
builder should know. Maybe they are good, but from what I've heard and
seen, please be careful and DONT ,mail order. I had a very hard time
getting money out of them for parts they bought from me and I live local
to them (long story) Just go shop at the swap meet like they do to buy
your parts !
Piece it together  !!! yes its cheaper and if you have the time and with
the list knolledge it should be a piece of cake.

A lot of us are doing conversions so info shouldnt be a problem.

Good Luck, 
 Don
