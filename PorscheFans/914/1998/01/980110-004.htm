It might be easier to tell you were there is no rust<VBG>  The suspension
console, motor mounts, engine compartment (except for under the battery
tray) are in good shape.  The worst area is the rear trunk, which I'm not
concerned about.  The inner rocker panel on the drivers side is the worst of
the two.  Towards the rear of the rocker there is an area about 10 inches
wide and about 4 inches deep.  The floor panel on the passenger side has an
area about  5" where the seat was bolted, and I can see the garage floor
through that one:(  Other than that she's in pretty good shape<VBG>
      I don't have a lot of experience with welding, so with the help of a
co-worker and his acetylene torch I thought I would try brazing.  I'm more
failure with soldering techniques.  The car was given to me and I don't have
any money in it yet.  So I figure if it didn't work I could remove the metal
and save my money as Dirk suggest.  But for me to save money is like finding
a rust free 914:)
