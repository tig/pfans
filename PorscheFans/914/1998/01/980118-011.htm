HI ALL, 
I too have H-4 with 80/100's but since mine isnt running yet there isnt
a problem. I need to know what relay to use also, when some one find out
please let us all know.

So whats the deal with these blue Ion bulbs ?? they sound cool, I have
noticed some cars on the road with blueish lights...anyone know ?? IS it
just the latest headlights out ???
