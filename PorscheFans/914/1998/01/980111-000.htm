If you're not concerned with how long the tires will last, then try the
A008Rs or A032. They're not as sticky as the R1 or Hoosier, but will
provide miles and miles of grins. But not too many miles... I had a set
of A008Rs tires turn to bald rocks in just 4-5,000 miles. I shoulda
tossed 'em then but kept going on em for another 1-2k miles. Race tires
were _never_ intended to be long-lived street tires.

Don, you bring up a good point for street driven cars. And this harkens
back to the old saying "what's hot for a race car, may not be
appropriate for a street car.". Yes, I've run race tires on the street
on my 914 when it was a daily driver. And yes, I've managed to
effectively sandblast the undercoating in the wheel wells completely
off. Driving race tires on normal roads is like running a very big lint
roller over a patch of gravel. Just listen to a car on race tires roll
by you slowly in a parking lot/paddock. You can hear all of those little
pebbles being pulled off the ground and thrown into the wheel well. I
have to clean out the rockers more frequently when I run race tires
because of all the debris they throw up. And that grit finds its way to
the most unusual places too.

If you've got the money, and rain isn't an issue, then the only serious
concern you should have is the lint roller effect. But it is a concern
for some, so think about it. Yes, a set of R1s are going to be alot
cheaper than a set of P-Zeros. They won't last quite as long, but the
Pirellis won't throw grit and debris around like the race tires do.
