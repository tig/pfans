Hi Yarko,

Since this car won't be on the street, you don't need to worry
about the e-brake.  It seems to me that Patrick Motorsports
can solve all your problems.  I've got a copy of their flyers
and they sell 911 struts and brake kits for 914-6 conversions.
They also sell funky CV cages which you'll probably need.
If you want some sort of e-brake, you can get a line lock
from them for $50 (not legal for street use).

Depending on your use, you probably DON'T need the 915
tranny....it'll be a big headache.  A track car doesn't need
1st gear much so the weakest part of the 901 tranny can
be avoided.  The ring & pinion failures 911 track cars have
experienced with the 915 tranny isn't an issue with a mid-
engined 914 because the ring gear is spinning in the other
direction, which allows *WAY* more oil to mesh with the
pinion - resulting in far fewer failures.

Patrick Motorsports has ads in Excellence and Panorama.

Good luck!
