Hello, I didn't know Swepco made synthetic anything. The only synthetic
gear oils that I know of are the Amsoil and Redline and the like. It was my
understanding that Swepco has always been dino-juice.

Even just changing the tranny oil to fresh stuff can make a noticeable
change. Alot of people ignore their transmission oil unless it starts
making little puddles under the car. Don't ignore it. Ignoring transmision
oil changes can be just as costly as ignoring engine oil changes. You know
how much a new ring and pinion alone costs? Ouch.

Also make sure that all of your bushings are in good shape. If not, a
single bad bushing can have a very noticeable impact on the entire shift
linkage.
