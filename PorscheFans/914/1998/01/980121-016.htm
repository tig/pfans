I would like to know the correct fuse box configuration for a '73 2.0. As
i've heard is common, i've lost the fuse box cover. Thanks!

 The lever and associated pivot shaft are somehow retained by something
 inside the caliper. They don't just come off after the spring is removed.
 Not having a diagram of the internal construction and not seeing anything
 obvious (like a snap ring) anywhere, I'm stuck. I hope George Hussey has an
 answer, something besides the usual "don't take it apart" thing I always
 hear from people. Hell, I've been taking stuff apart since I was a little
 kid. It's in my bones damnit! I usually get stuff back together too!

You have to take out the round plate at the top of that piece of the caliper.
Under the plate is a snap ring that, when removed, will allow you to remove
the lever and shaft.  You get the round plate out by drilling thru it and
prying it out.  I resealed mine by brazing the hole back up before putting the
plate back in.
