According to Dr 914's Tech Tips 700, you will get a rattling noise that 
appears to be valve clearance related that intermittently comes and goes 
from your 'teener if the valve guides are loose in the heads. Hmmmmm....I 
may have this problem.   Has anyone out there had that happen before? Can 
this be diagnosed with the engine still in one piece?  I'd assume the 
heads have to come off.  

I've adjusted the valves several times, had other VW mechanics adjust 'em, 
put in 914-6 swivel head adjusting screws (because I could not seem to 
ever get the clearance to stay just right) and sweared alot, but still the 
thing sounds like it's coming apart at times....scary. 

It's a '73 1.7 with a 1.911 big bore kit(I believe 94mm pistons), Dual IDF 
44 Webers(Aaaaaaaaah!), SCAT cam, 1.8 heads(had 1.8 heads and pistons when 
I got it). The cam/lifters are new, new valves, new rings, mains, rod 
bearings, oil, pump, everything balanced, etc., etc...complete rebuild 
done last spring.  The extra noise started about 5 months after the 
rebuild.  I've always thought it was noticeably noisier than other '14s 
I've heard(before the rebuild too), even others with the Webers. It's 
relatively quiet when it's cold, but as soon as it warms up the rattling 
begins.

Please send responses to both email addresses below, and the 914 page.
Thanks in advance for the help I know I'm about to get...
