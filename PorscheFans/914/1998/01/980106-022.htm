>ordinary street driving. The recommended venturi for the 914 when using
a
>40IDF is 32mm.

You may want to qualify by specifying a stock 2.0 for the 40 IDF/32
venturi.  If you're running a stock 1.7 you'll probably do a little
better with 30mm venturis.  If you're running a fire-breather with big
valves, you'd probably want 44 (or even 48) IDFs with bigger venturis.
I don't have any experience with the 1.8 and haven't run the numbers
through the formula so can't say for sure on it.

I may be mistaken, but I have a vague recollection that 36mm venturis
aren't available for 40IDFs (as in they don't fit!).  Also, FYI, while
main, air, and idle jets (as well as emulsion tubes) are interchangeable
between 40,44,48 IDFs and there 3-throated brethren, the venturis are
NOT - the outside diameter is fitted for each of the different size
carbs.  So when you order venturis, be sure and specify 40IDF or 44IDF
or whatever.  BTDT.

There is no difference for the intake manifolds between a 1.7 and a 1.8.
The difference is when you go to a 2.0 head - there are only 3 studs
instead of 4 (although this does not apply to VW Bus 2.0 heads).
