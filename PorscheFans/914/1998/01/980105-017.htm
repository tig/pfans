First question is, is this a Porsche type mechanic ?

On 914, when the rear bearing starts to go you get a grinding or
groaning sound from one side (the one that is failing). 

CV joints on the other hand start to click at gear shifts and
start/stops. (this could mean they are just dry and need grease).

Unless you have run the joints dry, or are running a "BIG 911" motor
they usually don't go bad quickly, in fact most 914's I have seen have
the same ones the factory put in, just repacked.

I would seriously question anybody who told me all four were bad !

It sounds like a "I need some money job" to me.

	Hey all,

	        I have been informed by my mechanic that I need new CV
joint(s).  I
	hear a noise that only seems to come from the right side of the
car.  But he
	says that it is possible all four are worn out. With CV joints @
90$ each,
	plus labor, this could end up being a seriously expensive bill.
From reading
	the past posts, it seems that you can take a worn out CV joint
from the right
	side of the car, and swap it with one on the the left side of
the car.  About
	how much mileage do you get out of the swap versus just
replacing? 
	        If BOTH sides of the car need new CV's, then it would be
econmically
	smarter to do the swap, than buy new ones, cause you would have
had to pay
	the labor to take apart various parts of the drive train's on
BOTH sides.
	But, if only ONE side of the car has CV joints that need to be
replaced, would
	it be more expensive in labor to do the swap?  Cause there would
be all that
	extra labor to take out the CV joint, on the other side, that
did not need to
	be replaced.  So basically what I am saying is, about how long
does it take a
	good mechanic to take out (one or both) CV's on a given side?
Is it only
	beneficial to do the swap if BOTH sides need replacing?

	PS: please don't respond saying I should do the work myself
myself, cause I
	won't!

 Does anyone have the address for that 914-6GT web page?  And while you're
 at, does anyone have the address Rich Johnson's page that shows his

You can reach Glen's page thru my GT page, "http://fly.hiwaay.net/~jonlowe".
I have pictures of the reinforcements installed on my GT replica.
