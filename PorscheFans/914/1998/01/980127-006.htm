Im in the process of using an Electromotive TEC-II on my '74 2.0.  I haven't
got the system yet but I do have the software and the manual.  Im
fabricating my own dual throttle body intake for it.  There are others out
there Haltech (unreliable), Holley (very little experience with it, works
best as a TBI set-up), Simple Digital (have a friend thats going to use this
on his formula car, I'll tell you how it works out) and of course there's
Motec (great system but very, VERY expensive).  The Electromotive has many
of the feature of the Motec at 1/3 the price.  And it will run closed loop
which makes tuning much easier.  Im not going to take the engine out to
dyno-map the injection and ignition.  Ive talked to and ridden with a couple
people that have mapped theirs in the car and it seems to work out okay.

I'll keep you guys posted on how it goes.  There was a thread on this a
while back and I know a few of you are interested in it.
