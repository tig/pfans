    Yeah, Martin... Buy a VDO pump and a windshield-washer-fluid
    tank (both from a 911) and just mount them in the trunk... It's
    pretty easy, although finding a good location for the switch can
    be difficult.

    At least one 914 owner has mounted the switch in the wiper stalk,
    so the pump is actuated just as the stock windshield washers
    were.

    3M makes a few different grades of electrical tape... The one I
    like is called "Super 88".  It should weather the heat and fumes
    better than "hockey tape".

    Sounds like teh Stan Cooper gauge, which I believe someone is
    producing and selling... You can see pictures and a description
    on page 10 of the March 1997 issue of Pano.

    Personally, I don't like it much, since the silkscreening on the
    temperature and pressure gauges isn't level... It looks sorta
    cheesy to me, but I guess there are a lot of people who don't
    mind.

    If you don't mind going to a little effort, you can do something
    that I think looks a LOT nicer:  Replace the big red brake light
    in the upper half of the stock combo gauge with an oil-temp
    gauge, then buy a 911 Turbo tachometer and re-silkscreen the
    turbo boost gauge in the center of it so it shows oil pressure.

    That's what I've got in my car, and it looks REAL clean... And
    it puts the oil pressure gauge right in the center of your tach,
    where it's easiest to see.
