Need some help from the collective wisdom.

I loaned my 14 to my son who is stationed with the USMC in Bilouxi. I am in
Tarpon Springs 500 miles away.  As seems to always be the case mechanical
failure has occurred and I am not in the position to get up there right now
to fix it.  According to the wrench he got it to the oil cooler has blown
out and needs to be replaced.  Throwing oil like a mad man.

What would be a reasonable charge on replacing this unit.  Just looking for
a ball park figure so he ( and I) don't get screwed.  Thats the problem
when one does your own grunt work, you loose touch on what mechanics are
getting for comparable jobs.

Does the engine need to be dropped to replace the cooling unit.  If so I
may have some other things done while it is disemboweled.

Any and all ideas would be appreciated,

PS on a really short time frame here.

TIA

Hi
I want to install an accusump oil accumulator on my 2.0 L 914. It also has an
external oil cooler regulated by a thermostic control. Can anyone out there
advise me on how to plumb in the accusump?
Thanks
Rick
