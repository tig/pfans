Howdy P-Fans, 
Well I spent a hour or so on the phone tonight and found quite a few
Hotels in the area that had rooms ! I couldnt get into Motel 6 with the
Orange county group but was able to get a room in SeaSide at the Bay
Breeze Inn (1800) 899-7129 and they said they had more roon avail and
about 15 minutes from the track, but is a few buck more than motel 6.
also found some rooms in Salinas too, so hope is not lost at all.
See ya there !!! Get them while you can !!!

couldnt get the Room finder to answer all day.
