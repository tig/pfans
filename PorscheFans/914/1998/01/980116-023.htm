the dimensions in there for height and distance from the wall apply?>>

The principle of aiming low-beams is that they have to point downwards
slightly.  The proper numbers, if I remember correctly, are 3" over 25'.
What you do is measure the height of your headlights, say 26" above ground.
Park your car with the nose 25' away from the wall, and measure 26" and
chalk a line across.  Then measure another line, 23" (26-3=23") up and chalk
this.  Your low-beams should hit the lower line, and your high-beams should
hit the upper one.  Make sure that they're aimed properly left-right.

If you pay attention to your beam spread, you can quickly "check" your
headlights every time you park at that supermarket.  In my case, I use the
fence at the end of our townhouse complex.

<<. I also better wire up the relay I ripped out of my old 914. Anybody
got a Procedure? The relay is a square Hella and I simply cut it out
of the wreck with no diagram. >>

You can find my relay diagram at
