>>I want to add sway bars to the front of my 914.  I have some
questions.
>>First does it require any drilling?  Is there a size that is best for

>>drive on the street.

I've done it.  Twice - both times on cars that had never had them.  No
problems, but a little work.  Both cars had the U-tabs on the A-arms so
I didn't have to mess with welding them on.

First off, buy the Weltmeister mounting kit ($16).  This eliminates the
need for any welding and makes installation much easier by providing
detailed instructions and a template to make sure you drill/cut in
exactly the right place.  You'll need a 'key-hole' drill bit - I don't
remember what size, but you can get it at your local discount hardware
store - it'll tell you in the mounting kit instructions.

The gist of it is, remove the gas tank and put the front of the car up
on jack stands so its real secure and remove the front wheels.  Using
the template, mark your 4 holes (1 for the bar, 3 for bolts) on the
outside of the inner fender wall.  Drill them out (watch out for the
wiring harness on the driver side -ask me how I know...).  Now the PITA
part.  Where the inside plate mounts to the inside of the inner fender,
there's a metal seam.  You have to clean that off so the overlap is gone
so the plate will sit flat against the inner wall.  I used a combination
of a drill, pliers, grinding wheel, file, and sweat to do mine.  On the
second car, we used a grinder and, in my opinion, made a messier
installation.  Pre-fit the mounting plates to make sure all the bolts
will line up.  RUST-PROOF THE METAL that you have drilled!!!  Bolt up
the plates and run the bar through.  That's all there is too it.  Took 2
guys about 2-3 hours to do a nice job of it.

As far as what bar to run?  That's pretty much pocket-book dependent.  I
bought a factory (16mm) bar for $75 (also get new bushings if you buy
used).  I couldn't believe the difference!!  I still get a little body
roll on tight corners, but compared to running w/o a bar, its incredibly
flat.  I daily-drive the car and do local autocrosses monthly - works
great and is NOT at all uncomfortable around town.  (I run 140lb springs
in the rear.)

I suppose the 22 or 23 mm adjustable bars are even better, but for the
$300, I can buy a pair of R1s.  If you want to go the stock-bar route,
post an inquiry to the list - I'm certain someone out there's got a
spare sitting around.
