Hello 914'ers
Once again I have seen something that someone didnt think of or just
thought was crazy , ok maybe it is. Between my friends and I there are
plente of 914 between us (about 12 including race cars and not counting
there customers cars) We have been kicking around the idea of a
rotisserie, but then what do you do with it when we're done and the cost
or time to make it.
 So what my cheapo friends did was take two old 911 lug pattern rims
weld two more rims (with centers cut out) to the porsche wheels, so you
now have one rim thats is the width of two wheels. then they made a Xmas
tree stand pattern out of steel stock and welded it to the wheels. so it
looks like (if sitting on the floor) a big X with two wheels wheeled to
it, following so far ??
Intented use is to finish the bottom of our cars, our paint guy hates to
try and work on them from the bottom and since there isnt a lift in the
paint shop, well get the point ? Now I have so say this part since I
really feel for you mid west guys, we dont have rust so in this case we
dont need to worry it been true in these stands.

Oh yeah, ok we bolted the wheels onto 914 with 5 lug (guess you could do
4 lug wheels too) now the car is striped for paint but still have
suspension in it, its light so 5 of us lifted it onto its side and with
the wheels acting as stands, it stood there on its side with no problem.
It was cool !! 
I stop by a few days later and the paint guy had cleaned preped and
painted the bottom/wheel wells of the car (he just taped off suspension)
It looked great, got every nook and cranny too.I swear I have never seen
a bottom of a 914 that looked so good.
I know way to long a story. 
 Seeya, 
 Don
