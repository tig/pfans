	All--
	I'm in the market for a new full-size floor jack.  I sold
my old one when an opportunity came along, mostly because I've been
seriously considering getting a new one for a while.
	A friend has a Craftsman that has an "extra" small lever in
addition to the main jack handle.  It's just the right size and lo-
cation so you can pump it with a foot.  I liked that idea a lot--
but I cannot find it anywhere, not even in the Sears catalog.   8^(
	I have managed to find a Lincoln jack at my local Pep Boys
for $200.  I remember hearing very good things about Lincoln jacks
via e-mail in the past.  Are they still Hot Stuff?  I am pretty sure
I can get a jack just like my old one for $50-60, so is the Lincoln
going to be that much better?  The old one was OK, but not fantastic.
It served me for four years, and was still working fine when I sold
it.
	Thanks for any input.
