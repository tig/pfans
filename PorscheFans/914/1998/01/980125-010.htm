Uh oh, carefull there Bill. Someone might turn you in. ;)

Weight up front should only make a small difference when you're up in
tripple digits. The aerodynamic forces are quite strong at those speeds.

You're right, this is not good. A deep air dam will be pretty much
defeated if you're forcing high pressure air under the front of the car.
Not that an air dam won't be a help, but ducting air from the high
pressure front of the car to the low pressure bottom of the car, the
advantage of an air dam is reduced quite a bit.

Certainly keeps the air out. Rather like cowling flaps for aircraft
engines. The cowling would get closed down at higher speeds (especially
dives) to prevent shock cooling of the motor. 

2" inches is really really low, is this a street driven car? How can you
navigate even a shallow driveway ramp without dragging the nose of the
car? I had 3" of front clearance and that was as low as I could
reasonably make the air dam on the front of the car and still have it
streetable. And I still would drag the edge of the front spoiler from
time to time. Now that my car is no longer a daily driver, the ground
clearance problem is not as much of an issue.

Making a splitter then? That's what I'm thinking of doing. Kindof like
automashin's super duper front spoiler.

Take a look at the front of a GT or Production class racer to see what I
mean. Yes, they have big open intakes in the front, but a better
location for venting is the wheel well where poluting the low pressure
environment does not have as much of a side effect. Then look at the FIA
GT-1 cars, they're venting that radiator through the hood and avoiding
polluting that valuable low pressure area entirely. Because my class
rules have effectively dissalowed my installing a front mounted oil
cooler (can't cut sheet metal in any non-factory way), I don't have the
concerns of venting high pressure air.
