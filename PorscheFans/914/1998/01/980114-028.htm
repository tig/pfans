Stef... You might want to consider contacting MittelMotor GmbH in Essen. =
I have not bought any of their glass fiber products so I cannot vouch =
for the quality. Their catalog indicates that they carry most of the =
GT-style fiber parts as well as the 916 bumpers plus various valance =
types. I have considered the GT-style bumpers for my car and being in =
Denmark I also find the shipping prices for such large items rather =
expensive from US. If you get a chance to inspect the quality from =
MittelMotor or some other European parts dealer please let me have your =
view on the quality.
