Hi All, 

After reading the threads on the BFG R1's I thought great, I will buy
these since I want a good sticky tire for the street and I dont plan on
rain driving. Reason being my race buddy just spent $1100.00 for very
good street tires (cant remember brand) and I know I want the same after
driving his car, I think they where BFG's for the street ??
So I went to him and ask, why spend a grand when for what half that he
could have very sticky tires (R1's) "He said" that R1's arent good for
the street because they are too soft and they tend to throw up sticky
rubber and every rock off the street that you run over and will ruin
your paint. I know every one has an option, but his his a good one ??
There is no way I really want to risk that, I know rock chips happen, by
why speed the process up ???
Just wondering out loud..............

Don
