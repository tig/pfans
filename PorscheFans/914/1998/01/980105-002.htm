Weber also has a listing of "suggested applications" for those that wish to
change induction. The list has several applications of Weber carbs, from
40IDF to 48IDA. The venturis in these carbs can be changed, so that the
basic carb is very adaptable to different engines and different
applications. The 904 setup was for racing, where you generally run at high
rpm for sustained periods. This application calls for a larger carb than for
street driving. Too large of a venturi will kill you low end torque. For the
street, 40 or 44 IDF carbs are fine. Note also that the IDA series are
racing carbs in that they don't have any cold start enrichment device. (the
early 911's had IDA carbs and had to have a hand throttle for warmup) The
IDF has a cold start enrichment device as an option, so they are better for
ordinary street driving. The recommended venturi for the 914 when using a
40IDF is 32mm.
