Hi, I'm Stan Witherspoon. I'm 37, married, have; no kids, 2 mutts, and
an electric 75 1.8 914 all living in Sacramento, Ca. I have been
attracted to 914s for about 5 years.

I blame my wife Pam for this.

My first experience was reading an article in a technical journal about
electric cars with a
photo of a red electrified 914 giving test rides. One thing led to
another and in '93 I rushed out and found an unsmogable carbed
multicolor (3 different colors applied with spray cans over the original
faded silver) 73 Calif. 1.7 with VW mags advertised as "NO Rust" for
$700. The clincher was that while we were looking at it, Pam had dropped
the line that she had always wanted a 914. It had been sitting under a
tarp for 2 years, but we got it started and I test drove it around the
block.

"Hmm,brakes seem soft, engine sounds rough, is there anyone behind me to
try a brake test- What the- where's the rear view mirror? Oh, here it is
in the glove compartment".

So I bought it.

We completed the sale as darkness fell and I started home wih Pam
following. "Getting dark, better turn on the lights" - Headlights work,
but inside, the car is pitch black. About halfway home a square yellow
light appears in the darkness. "What's that - oh well, it's only yellow,
I'll look it up when I get home".

A little later, "cough, cough, sputter, sputter".

"Uh-Oh".

Engine dies.

"So THATS what the yellow light means".

Luckily I was passing through a residential neighborhood and could coast
into a side street. Pam stopped to find out what happened, and with a
flashlight I confirmed my suspicions then she went to get some gas as I
couldn't lock the doors with the assortment of keys that I had.

I got the car home and discovered a few things. Rust.. A wiring harness
that was a cross between a McGyver episode and a working model of an
Amazon rain forest covered with oil and then set fire. I went to work
the next day and surfed the net (though it wasn't called that yet) and
found the PFiles mailing list (I have an archive for the 914 articles
for '94). Learned about "Dave's Big Butt Test" (it passed) and
researched my plan to convert it to electric. I
stripped it down to a rolling shell during the next year. Our plans were
to convert it to electric using a kit being put out by Electro
Automotive but there always seemed to be somthing else that needed the
cash.  Time passed and I made very little progress on the car other than
selling the engine, gas tank, and other internal combustion parts. Last
year I sadly sold it to a coworker (he is turing it into a SCCA track
car - we'll see) and turned around and bought a white 75 1.8 that had
been converted to electric by a lady in San Francisco. On the first
sunny day we drove it to work with the top off.  We spent the next three
days grinning from ear to ear. It needs some work as well and has more
rust than the 73, but it's driveable. I signed up for a Mig welding
class at the local community college. I have been driving it to work and
back until a bad wiring connection stranded me just before Christmas. I
will have time to fix the wiring and install new springs and torsion
bars this weekend.


Stan
