I bought a set of seat covers from GPR.  He (Dave) doesn't advertise
them,
and they take a while to get.  Appearantly a local (to SLO) upholstery
shop
has a perfect pattern for stock seats, and makes re-cover kits out of
quality
vinyl.  Look great, and cheaper than either of the above two options.

If it's already sagging, get the kit.  Either the AA clam shell, or the
Parts-Werks
"longitudinal support kit".  PW will sell one side at a time; they sell
more rights
than lefts.....  I've got them on mine; they're labor intensive to
install, but you
have a buddy that welds.  Installing a pair of "heavy duty" supports
will make a once
saggy car more rigid than stock.  George's kit looks better (in the
ads), and I've had
very good luck with his metal before.
