	Did you try <www.smogcheck.org>?  I think that will have the
"real version".
	The short version is that cars up through the 73 model year
are now completely exempt from all smog regulations, and never ever
have to get checked.
	There are probably some provisions in there about keeping the
original/original-type motor, but I don't think it really matters since
they won't be checking anyway.

	Too bad it doesn't rely on the year the car was built.  My 74
was built 10/73, so it still has to get smogged.  (But only for five
more years!!!)

It is to hold the spare tire down if you want to put something big in the
front compartment.  Stock tire holddown will work.
