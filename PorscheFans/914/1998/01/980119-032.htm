Hi Gary!

  I got mine pretty close by putting the mounts on backwards;  there
is more "down" in the mounts than "up', which is reversed when they
are turned around.

  Now, if I could only get them to quit sagging out of adjustment!  
Out here in the desert, the high-viscosity grease that they use on
the swivel balls at the factory turns to 10 weight oil in the desert
summer sun, and the mirrors sag down to their lowest position a few
seconds after being adjusted!   If I didn't have two drivers with
very different sizes for the car, I would glue them!

   I intend to dis-assemble them (again) one of these days and remove
the grease, and see what else I can do to tighten them up.   

   Anyone have any better ideas that they would be willing to share?
