Not important, in my opinion. You should check it for shorts and opens.

Should I go through the process of scraping

Leave it alone, unless your a nut like me and you've got nothing better to
do. I scraped and soldered mine, and it's an extremely messy and smelly
job. It's also tricky to get the solder joint correctly soldered, since all
the connections are dirty. They are also recessed, which makes it hard to
clean them in preparation for soldering. You need to use a liquid acid to
get under the rivets so that the solder will flow well.

If it was me, I'd just buy new injectors.
