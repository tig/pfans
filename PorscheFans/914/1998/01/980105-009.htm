There is at least one pro body guy lurking on this list. He can tell you :)

But, what I think I know is that you need to ventilate *during* the spraying
to keep from poisoning yourself, even with a mask on. You need clean heated
air blowing through to spray paint in the winter. I think that you could buy
a used gas furnace, pipe the output into the garage, and connect the input
to the great outdoors. Put the furnace in a separate room too. I think also
that you want the room to be pressurized, and you want any doors to the rest
of your house sealed tight, otherwise you'll get paint fumes in the house.
You have to seal up all the cracks in the walls also.
