John,
Welcome to reality about some of the 914s. Don't feel like you are alone in
what happened to you. Last year, I had one similiar to yours and I was
completely taken in. However, I had thought that my eagle eyes could detect
any kind of rust and trouble by a close visual inspection. Man, was I wrong.
I had removed the engine and put in a rebuilt 2.0 before passing it to
someone else. Even then it was more than I could take on financially at the
time. After many hours of doing my thing, I threw my hands up and shed
myself of it. I promise you, I told the purchaser all I found wrong. Wish I
had that engine back right now, as I am now the owner of a 1970 1.7 but carb
trouble keep it from making me smile a lot. It is the 20th I have owned
since 1970. My skills have diminished considerably since retiring due to
nothing to do it with.

If I had been around on the list, I probably would have been on the list of
those who stroked your fire about owning a 914 and the fun attached to it.
Once you have enjoyed the spirit of owning a 914 that does what you expect,
you will understand what we all rant and rave about. I promise.

Your posts showed quality and endeavor even as you got taken by someone.
Yes, you are truly Porsche material so if the hunk you bit is bitter, this
list is heavy with sadness should you venture away. We need more of the
caliber you show, by the friendship, humor, helping others and skills shown.

My 914 was free but needs a lot of attention and good advice from list
members such as you. Wish I had a parts car! I really don't know where to
start. I am retired so time is not a problem, just money. Everyone has that
problem it seems. 

Cold weather in N.H. is bad, but here in Tn. we have some pretty cold days
too and the next day may be in the 60s like today, but pouring rain makes it
seem colder. Same elsewhere except So. Calif. & Az. Just El Nino!
Life must be great to own a 914 and live there or Az.

A lot of us have had our 914s disassembled, but not to the extent that you
described at one time. If I can help answer your questions, I will and so
will anyone on this list. Get an Automobile Atlanta catalog for the 914. It
is very useful as a tool. You will understand what I say when you see it.

Good luck and hope you stick around. I did after all the same.

Mike Cooley
