I know money don't grow on trees, but if you are having the labor done,
I'd suggest buying new CVs.  If a CV joint is worn out, its worn out.
And no amount of swapping direction or anything else is gonna change
that.  It may make the joint quiet down for a while, but its still going
bad and needs to be replaced and this is only going to buy you a short
reprieve (and maybe strand you on the side of some dark, deserted road
some night).

I'd question your mechanic's recommendation to replace all 4 of them
though!!  You can always figure out which side is the problem and
usually narrow it down to an inner or outer one.  Figure out which one
is making the noise and replace it.  Leave the others until they wear
out.  About the only thing that will cause one of these chunks of metal
to go bad is if the boot splits out and all the grease flies the coop.
Then you get dirt, water and other crap in there and the balls inside
the joints start eating themselves.

CV joints going bad usually start making clunking sounds (although I've
heard them howl too).  As another listee suggested, its possible that
its your rear wheel bearings and not a CV joint.  That's even worse news
cause it'll cost you about $200-$250/side (parts and labor) to have
those replaced.

Good luck.
