Best bang-for-the-buck tire on the market if you ask me...

Gack! Rocks, innexpensive, low-profile rocks.

The Nitto is popular because it's cheap and looks cool. As for actual
performance compared to the A509? I havn't owned a set, but I've ridden
in a "Rice boy" car on Nittos, and it really didn't have much grip. Just
a single data point though. Personally, I think the Yoke has 'em beat
hands down.
