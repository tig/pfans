   I presume that there is an O-ring on the adjuster, similar to that
on the outside.   As you note, I didn't take mine that far apart, 
but I am sure of one thing:  There should NOT be any fluid present in
the rear part of the caliper housing where the parking brake
actuation lever and associated mechanisms reside.   If you have a
leak around the parking brake lever, then you will have to
dis-assemble the whole thing, as you have an INTERNAL leak.   I do
not know how the inner adjuster comes apart;  I assumed previously
that it was retained by the internal cross-shaft of the hand-brake
lever, and that once the big spring was removed from the lever, that
it would come out of the caliper body, and that the threaded adjuster
could then be unscrewed or simply pulled out by reaching into the
piston bore with your fingers and extracting it through there.   
   Dirk Wright wrote, I believe, that even after he had removed the
hand-brake spring, he could go no farther.   I do not understand
whether or not he was able to remove the brake lever together with
it's pivot shaft from the caliper.   Perhaps he will write and
clarify this.
  In any event, you will have to discover how to remove the inner
piston mechanical actuator to renew the O-ring that probably resides
thereon, as I am assuming that this is the culprit.   If you figure
out how to do this, please let me and the list know, as this is the
last step in understanding the rebuild process.
   I have an old pair of rear calipers that I bought a long time ago,
with the intent of using them first to design a tool which would
enable easy removal of the hand-brake lever spring, and then to
further dis-assemble them so as to gain insight on the construction
of the inner adjuster mechanism and hand-brake actuation mechanism. 
I have put this project aside for more pressing things, but if you
feel that you need data in advance of dis-assembling yours, please
advise and I will try (though I can't promise) to re-visit my old
project and see if I can develop some additional information.
   If anyone else on the list already knows the answer to this
puzzle, please enlighten us all.

					Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
