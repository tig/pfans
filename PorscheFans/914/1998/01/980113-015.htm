Jim Appello posted Clamshells, Rustoration, etc.

After reading this post, I agree that if you can afford it, this is the best
thing to do for rustoration. Have it done by a body shop.
 
Generally the body shop repair work to the 914 is something most can't
afford which translates to do it youself or it won't get done.

Many on this list and elsewhere did not pay any more for their 914 than the
cost of having this rustoration done. Also to consider is that it probably
needs a lot of the mechanical problems corrected. By buying a 914 which
needs extensive rustoration, the truth is, most could not afford more money
for having this done.

80% of the owners fall into this catagory. I easily fit into this notch.
This is evident by current prices of the 914 seen on the Internet and
locally.   Average price falls between $1500 to $2500 and still no buyers in
majority of cases.

We are more inclined to spend money for parts and just take our chances on
getting around to the rustoration in patch mode.

This is not true in some cases. Some paid top dollar for their 914 only to
discover later that rusted metal exceeded the good metal in crucial body
points. The cost factor dictates we spend additionally to protect our 914
investment by using professional body shops. Some are fortunate to have the
funds to accomplish these means. Some do not have the money so it returns to
the marketplace to "maybe" re-coup the owners cost with rust intact.
