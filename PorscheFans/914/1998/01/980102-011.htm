Nick:

It's not "more torque vs. less torque"; it's "more torque vs. less 
torque AT A GIVEN ENGINE SPEED".

A quick functional description of a four-stroke engine:

    1.  The intake valve opens and the piston moves down, sucking an 
        air/fuel mixture into the cylinder.

    2.  The intake valve closes and the piston moves up, compressing 
        the charge in the cylinder.

    3.  The spark plug fires, igniting the charge and forcing the 
        piston down.

    4.  The exhaust valve opens and the piston moves up, pushing the 
        exhaust gases out the exhaust port.

The four cycles are called "intake", "compression", "power", and 
"exhaust" (or "suck", "squeeze", "bang", and "blow" if you learned 
about them in an all-male shop class).

Now... An engine will work, especially at very high speed, with no 
exhaust pipe at all.  However, the engine can be made to work BETTER 
by adding a properly-tuned exhaust pipe.

Most people don't think about it much, but exhaust gases have a
certain amount of mass, which means that they also have a fair
amount of inertia... In other words, a blob (or "slug") of gas needs
some coaxing to start moving; once moving, it doesn't want to stop.

Exhaust pipes turn this to our advantage in two ways.  The first is 
pretty easy to understand; it's called the "extractor effect":

    When the exhaust valve opens, a slug of exhaust gas enters the
    pipe at well over atmospheric pressure and starts moving through
    the pipe at relatively high speed.  The piston accelerates as it
    moves through the first half of its upward travel, so it does a
    real good job of getting the exhaust gas moving.

    However... As the piston reaches the end of the exhaust stroke
    (i.e., as it gets closer to top dead center), it slows down and
    becomes less effective at pushing the exhaust gases out of the
    cylinder.

    Here's where the exhaust pipe comes into play... The slug of
    exhaust gas in the pipe is already moving, and it has enough
    inertia to PULL the remaining gas out of the cylinder even
    though the piston is no longer pushing. 

The second effect -- the more-complex one -- works like this:

    The slug of gas forms a pressure wave which travels to the open
    end of the pipe, then reflects back to the exhaust valve.  Two
    things are important to know:

        1.  It's a high-pressure wave on the way out, and it becomes
            a low-pressure wave when it's reflected back.

        2.  The wave travels at the speed of sound, no matter how 
            fast the exhaust gas is moving.

    Since it's a wave of low pressure when it gets back to the
    exhaust valve, it can help to pull exhaust gases out of the
    cylinder, augmenting the extractor effect.

That pressure-wave effect can actually be much stronger than the
extractor effect... If we arrange things properly, in fact, we can
open the intake valve BEFORE the exhaust stroke completes, and use
the combined extractor/pressure-wave effects to not only scavenge
exhaust gases from the cylinder, but to start pulling a fresh
air/fuel charge INTO the cylinder.

This has at least two benefits:

    1.  Since the intake charge has a certain inertia (i.e., it's
        hard to get moving), forcing it to START moving before the
        piston begins to move down will make it easier for the
        piston to suck it into the cylinder during the intake stroke.

    2.  If we can start opening the intake valve during the exhaust
        stroke, we can open it FURTHER than we could if we had to
        wait until the end of the exhaust stroke, without worrying
        about putting too much stress on it and the rest of the
        valve train (remember, all THOSE pieces have inertia, too, so
        if we try to move them too far, too fast, we're likely to
        break something).

Ok... Here's the problem, and the answer to your question:

Since that pressure-wave travels at the speed of sound, it always 
takes THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME for the wave to travel from the exhaust 
port, through a given-sized pipe to the open end, then back to the 
port.

For engines that always run at a constant speed (like those in
aircraft and in vehicles with continuously-variable transmissions),
this is no big deal... But for OUR engines, it means that we have to 
CHOOSE the engine speed at which we want the greatest advantage from 
the pressure wave.

The longer we make the exhaust pipe, the longer it takes for the wave 
to travel back and forth along it.  For the maximum pressure-wave 
effect at low RPMs, therefore, you'd want an exhaust pipe that's 
longer than one that you'd use for the best effect at high RPMs.

Other variations on the shape of the pipe have similar effects... 
Narrowing the pipe does the same thing (although to a lesser degree) 
as shortening it, and adding a megaphone makes the reflected wave 
stronger, but only in a narrow range of speeds.

So... Short pipes with megaphones are good for engines that run in a 
narrow range of high speeds, but longer straight pipes are better for 
engines that need to both run over a wide range of speeds and develop 
their peak torque at relatively-low speeds.

Did that help?
