Hey,

I've got one, and they are really cool gadgets.  I never got the hang
of flipping down my helmet, and these work really well, though I still
close my eyes for a moment (blink) just as I strike the arc (hey, there's
still a slight delay there....=;^)  It certainly makes welding much easier
for a novice like me, and my Huntsman one was only ~$200 for a large
screen shield.  Ranks up there with the laser pointer I have just for driving
my dog nuts by making him chase it, and then turning it off..... =8^)
