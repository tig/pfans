Happy New Year Everyone!

Just my Torque story:  And actually a reply to the list from two years ago:

A long time ago I queried the list about the 2.4L kit and carb jets etc. 
This is what I came up with:

I strove for bottom end as I mostly autocross and don't really trust the
2.0L over 6000rpm.  So I used 2.0L heads with the stock valves but did
clean them up and port them 4mm over to match ADF48's and manifolds.  Using
40mm venturies 140main 200air 50 idle and a modified emulsion tube
resembling an F3 (that was the biggest headache, when the bottom was good
the top was lean, when the top was good the bottom was rich etc)

2" Velocity stacks with K&N's on top and made a header myself.  I took the
2.0L headers, cut off the flanges where the pipe curves opened them up 4mm,
welded them to a 2.25" pipe which I ran straight back to a modified 911
muffler.  The mods to the muffler included larger 2.25 inlets, more holes
in the box inside, removal of the obtrusive metal tabs on the edge of the
box, and a 3" outlet. (I did try megaphones but they would have caused a
lot of jet changes and were WAY too loud)

The result:  WOW!  At 1500rpm you can wack the throttle and the thing will
put you deep into the seat!  It pulls like a bear to 5500 and will spin
easily to 7000 although with diminished power. (So I don't do that!)

The only draw backs are:

The thing runs HOT!  A have a medium sized cooler up front and it still
runs hot.  I am going to modify the spoiler to get better air to the cooler
and also go to a bigger cooler.

When it gets warm it smokes a little.  The 2.4 barrels are very thin and
warp.  They also are impossible to seal perfectly and weep a little oil.

But man does it go!  I would guess an easy 160hp.  And with 225/45's and
the short 901 I'm about even with my buddies 3.6 C4 coupe in a straight
line.

I'm going to take the engine apart soon to see how it faired internally. 
I'll keep you posted.
