Hi Karen and Brad;

Who is Santa here?  (Heck, I don't even know where you live...... :-)

Anyway, are they the inners or outers?  Tell me it's not both (lotsa
welding time, Santa'll be busy)...  And, my answer is a definite
"maybe".. Helpful, huh?

If there is enough *good* metal left (like mine), then the answer is
yes. Could you tell me and the list exactly *where*, *how much* rust,
and a *very good* description of other rusted pieces in the area like
suspension console, firewall, etc?....

From my "rustoration" humbling adventure, I can go check the areas that
you describe directly on my car....  BTW: I presume your good with a
welding machine..... especially after reading Mike Cooley's post... :-)
