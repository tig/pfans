This weekend I was admiring my 914 from the rear and noticed that the 
*right* rear side was a little lower than the left.  I checked *all* tire 
pressures to insure tire eveness (they were fine).  The right tire is 
perpendicular to the ground, however, I noticed that the top of the *left* 
tire seems to be pointing in to the body more than the right does (the 
right tire looks pretty straight up-and-down).

The springs/shocks are the stock units from what I can tell (no receipts 
saying otherwise).  I know that springs can loose their, uh, spring over 
time...do you think that this could be the problem?  The shocks work okay 
(suspension rebounds only once, not several times).

I can put the car up on jacks in my garage; what should I look for/measure? 
 The car isn't a rust bucket but she is by no means rust-free, either.  I 
hope to God it's just springs!  I just had the tranny rebuilt and can't 
afford to have the arms and mounts replaced.
