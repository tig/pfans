OK, this is wierd. The consensus in the VW and 914 media and email is that
this will not work, or it is too expensive to be worthwhile. Everyone from
Bob Hoover to the Hot VW's magazine and numerous email messages indicate
that since the OEM cylinders are in fact not cylindrical, boring them out is
not practical. There have been references to very specialized boring
machines being required, etc. 

OK, I must confess, I like Corvairs. I wished I owned one instead of the
more expensive 2002, but that's "bridge under the water" (a colloquial
expression for dyslexics :). Anyway, it is common to hone and bore out
Corvair jugs and no one reports any problems. Clark's Corvair
(http://www.corvair.com) does it all the time. So, go figure. 

The design of the cylinders for the VW and Corvair are not substanitally
different, either. In fact, the Corvair motor is much superior to any VW air
cooled motor. The valves are angled a little (means you can run higher CR),
and the case has both top and bottom covers. It's a true "boxer" motor, like
the VW, so it's more compact than a 911 motor.
