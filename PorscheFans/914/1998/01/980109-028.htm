Definately a decel valve problem. But maybe not in the way you think.

Not neccessarilly. The decel valve is adjustable. There should be a
small nut on teh nipple that the little hose plugs into. That is what
you turn for the adjustment. You may need to dink with it to find the
right direction to go in, but try that. It could be that your decel
valve just went south, in which case you will want a new one. But try
adjusting it first. At this point, you don't have much to loose.

This relay board swapping strikes me a very bizzare approach to
shotgunning the problem. THe relay board would be the LAST thing I
suspect. The first thing I suspect are devices with moving parts.
