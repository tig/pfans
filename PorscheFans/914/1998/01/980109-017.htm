Yep, I have two of them!

Looks like a big puzzle piece in that it is a block with two knotches
cut in it to allow for different size positions, and has a strap with a
hook on it to tie it down with. It was covered in floor carpet. The
later cars had a foam insert under the carpet to level the foot rest
area, as well as a movable seat.

If you want one I will be glad to sell one.

	I have heard from someone who bought their 914 in 1970 that the
early
	models came with an optional foot stool to compensate for the
non-adjustable
	seat.  

	Has anyone else heard of this?  If so, do you know where I can
see a picture?

	Thx,

Hi Alan, it's true, my '70 sixer has one.  They sometimes called them dog
bones due to the strange shape. Kind of like a square edged dog bone.  I think
there are photos in the 914 guide to authenticity book.

Thx,
