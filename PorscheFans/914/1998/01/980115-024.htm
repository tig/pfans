Hi Don,
Enjoyed your "flipper" description.  I have plans out of "High
Performance Chevy" mag for a great rotisserie.  I built one for my
latest 914 project since on the last one I got burned, welded,
sandblasted, sprayed and eye-cut trying to work under the car.  The
thing worked better than I ever could have hoped for.  Everyone who saw
the car on the rotisserie wanted plans and went home to build their
own.  I'll be glad to send copy of plans and material list to anyone who
wants one.  It comes apart when you're finished using it and stores in
small space.  It was designed for American Iron frames so is more than
strong enough for 914s. Cost was about $200 for new steel and I mig
welded it at home.  I added 6" wheels on both ends to make easy to move
around shop.
Anyone in the Atlanta area is welcomed to come by and see it and if you
are a 914er I'll loan it to you for your project.
I also got in the mail today a flyer about a product called the "Easy
Tilter."  It looks like a greatly improved version of the "curved pipe"
rotator we've all seen.  The guy has a web site which I'm getting ready
to check out. See attachment.
Later,
Dr. Mike
