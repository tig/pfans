Here's my understanding of how things go together:
That whole rectangular box of metal running down each side of the car is
referred to as the longitudinal. Its one of the main structural parts of
the car. The part of it facing on the outer side of the car is what is
referred to as the inner rocker panel.  The chrome/plastic/painted steel
panel which most of the world sees, and is attached over top of the inner
rocker, is the outer rocker panel.

The inner side of the longitudinal where the handbrake is attached is just
called the inner side of the longitudinal (at least by me). (Anybody want
to have a name that part contest?)
