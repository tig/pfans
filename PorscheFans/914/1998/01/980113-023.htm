Hi all, I have done this job 4 or 5 times and can offer the following
comments.  But first I'd like to say I have been on this list over a
year now and really enjoy it.  Many Thanks to all of you.  Also, I 've
been hinted at to do my Chrismas bio ( which I never made the time to
do), to tell my vanity plate - R914SIX - and, thanks to a recent thread,
to put up my $.02 when I have something to say. So since I'm not holding
my 4 month old girl Hailey nor am I playing Barbies with my 3 1/2 year
old first born Rheanne, I'm gonna contribute.

	There are also some metal ones.  The plastic ones face down and the
metal ones unscrew towards the front.

	Don't really need to remove the steering wheel, guages or glove box. 
You will need to pull the tach and the speedo forward - be careful not
to scratch the paint on the bezel and get some slack in the speedo cable
before trying to pull it forward.  My experience has been that most/all
the nuts are only hand tight!

	An excellent way to make room to contort your body in such a way as to
get your hands behind the guages.

	To ease in getting these two nuts reinstalled you can take a pair of
needle-nose plyers and bend the sheet metal flatter and up a little to
get your fingers back in there.  Also, I put a little grease on the
washer and try to "stick" it up on the stud first.  That way you only
have to worry about getting the nut started on the threads.

	These two nuts you probably will need a short 13mm wrench to get
loose.  All the others I can usually loosen by hand with a socket.

Thats all for now.  I think I'll wait 'till next time to tell more about
me.

Cheers,
