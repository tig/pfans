Hi Brian & all;

Sorry 'bout the delay response, but took a business trip to somewhere in
the Great White North (3 hrs. North of Toronto - yes, in January..
Don't ask, but I just got back back (via dog-sled:-)  To all that asked
what can be done to facilitate the construction of a FAQ ("Frequently
Asked Questions") and/or tutorial database - thanks for all the offers
to help.  There are, however, a couple of questions around how and why a
FAQ needs to be searchiable.

If I put all FAQ's and tutorials in one big, mombo document, downloading
to read it would take a *really* long time. A better approach would be
to index individual, topic specific, FAQ's into separate documents on
the web site.  Unfortunately, there needs to be a search engine that can
find the key words included in those documents, and then create a list
of those documents that the users can select.  For those that asked,
that's the approach I'd like to use...

BTW: I'm playing with some technology now that will really help in the
creation of a 914 FAQ.  I *REALLY* need input about what other areas you
folks might want as well - things like a picture gallery, restoration
photos, links, etc....  Any input would be really helpful....

Oh yea, and the latest progress report about my 914 rehab project?
Waiting for a couple of parts to arrive for the *Reconstruction* (vs.
the previous 6 weeks of destruction)...   Yes, it is actually starting
to go back together!!!!


John
