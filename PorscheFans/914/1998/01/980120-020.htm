Hi Dave,

	When I was over in Italy during x-mass, I rented a Maxim (yes I know
Jap car in Europe), and it had a switch for light height. It had 5 positions
and it raised the beams. I checked out the system and it was a stepper motor
connected to the rear of the light box which raised or lowered the back of
the box. The front was hinged so the unit changed angles.

I asked a friend who lives there and he was suprised American cars did not
have this type of control, seems all the mid to upper cars have it over
there.
Regards,

		There is a procedure in the factory manual for aligning
H4's. It is
	really pretty simple.  If you pull up to a wall, you will notice
that there
	is a distinct light pattern.  The top of the bright-lit area will be
flat
	(horizontal), then abruptly angle upward to the right.  When your
car is
	straight and level, the point where this turn happens should be
level with
	(and directly ahead of) the center of your headlights.
		BTW, this is not exactly legal in the US.  I'm not sure
exactly why,
	but it may be that US headlights are supposed to point down by a
certain
	amount.  To do the aiming properly/legally over here, you need one
of those
	special gizmos that hangs off the bumps on the surface of the light.
If
	you don't have the bumps, then your headlights are (technically)
illegal for
	street use.
		I've given up being surprised about how arbitrary some of
the laws
	for "vehicle safety" are...
