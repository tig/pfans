	I have the Automoton kit, It is a ½" plate and new shift lever. The
throw is great, and the shifts are crisp. The only problem is when you
switch the shafts you have to pop out the two springs on the shifter base
and putting them back in is a pain, but you have to do that in all the kits.

	I have the kit from Performance Products. It's easy to install, by
	cutting the bottom off the stock shifter and then epoxying that into
the
	replacement part from the kit. The price was around $35, if I
remember
	correctly.
	You may need to re-adjust the shift linkage between the seats when
	you're done to make sure that 2nd/3rd are up against the spring
	pressure.
	I think Automotion make a kit that replaces the entire shift lever,
for
	somewhere under $100.
	I like the feel, and now 4th isn't such a stretch.
	The throw will be a little heavier, though.

	See ya,
