OPINION:

Most of MSHP's work is on Volkswagen motors.  Stainless valves are
an improvement over stock VW valves.  So for most of their customers,
they are an improvement.

Sodium filled valves are (much) better than stainless.  They are more
expensive, but they were designed in for a reason.

I would put the "Stainless is just as good" machinists into the same
box as the "These shrouds are extra" mechanics.
