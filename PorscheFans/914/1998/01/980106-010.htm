Drat; that's a bit of a disappointment....  I've currently got 7&8x15
Fuchs with 225's on the rear.  I haven't actually welded them on yet,
but a trial fit of the GT flares has the Fuchs "swimming" a bit in the
wheelwell.  I put on a set of 1.5" Automotion turbo wheel adaptors in
the back, and 1" adaptors up front, and things "look right" (No, this
is not a race car, so I'm not worried about any rules).  I was thinking
the 9" Fuchs would snug right into the rear, and I could lose the adaptor,
but I guess that's not the case.  I guess I could look at it as a big
cost savings, anyway.... =8^(

Say, the 914 was supposed to be pretty good in snow, isn't it?  I recall
seeing at least one ad for ski racks, etc.  Just throw on some studded
snows, and off you go! =8^)
