You have probably seen the strings of redneck jokes.
You might be a redneck if:
	Your front porch collapses and it kills more than 3 dogs.
	Your home has more wheels than your pickup.
	You mow your lawn and find a junk car.

Maybe it's time to start a Redneck PorscheFan string.
Yesterday I wanted to clean up some Model T parts, and went out back
where I keep drums of cleaner and solvent.  Lo and behold, in the drums
I find a set of Euro pistons and jugs!  For the life of me, I can't
remember where I got them.

Maybe it would be better to start an Old Pfans string with that one?

It seems like I am not as forgetful as I used to be.  At least I don't
remember forgetting as much as I used to.

Cheers,
