Last year I had my injectors flow cleaned/flow tested. I was told that I
had 1 @ 100% another at 72% 1 @ 54% and 1 @ 42%. I was going to buy 3
new ones, when in the course of the conversation, it came up that the
100% injector was just the one that flowed the best. It had no
relationship to any spec at all. I bought 4 new Lucas replacement
injectors from Metro fuel in Fort Worth for ~37 each. They have worked
perfectly and made a large difference
