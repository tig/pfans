I've been on this list for about two months now, and I've got to say,
this is the best list I've ever seen. I've picked up more good
information and I thought I knew a lot about the 914 from owning one
(actually I've owned 4 all together) for 13 years.

Anyway, I've been reading with interest the talk about welding. I've done
a fair amount of arc welding when I was a lot younger and have acquired
and set up a Lincoln Arc welder (220) in my garage. I've still to strike
a rod to metal but am itching to get started again.

I get an Eastwood catalog that talks about a couple items that look good
to me. One is a "Stitch welding" attachment that you are supposed to be
able to use with an arc welder. It says you can weld light guage steel
with it. Will this unit work with my Lincoln?

They also advertise a "spot weld" attachment for an arc welder. Will this
thing work on my Lincoln and has anyone had any experience with this
unit?

Thanks for all your great help!
