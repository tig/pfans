OK, I know some of you a vehemently opposed to splitting calipers, so you
can just ignore this query. 

I want to know from those that have done this successfully whether they
replaced the bolts and if so, what grade bolt did they use? The rebuild kits
I have include several O rings, presumably for the internal passage(s) and
other uses. I can get grade 10 bolts (150,000 psi) and nyloc nuts in metric,
but nothing higher. (well, I can get grade 12.4 bolts (176,000 psi) but no
nuts) Does anyone know what the torque spec is for those bolts?? And is
there a particular pattern for torquing them down (like head bolts)??

The reason I want to split my rear calipers is to zinc chromate plate them.
It would be a much better plating job to plate them while they are apart
then to keep them together. And for those that think plating is not a good
idea, just take a look at current production BMW's and VW's and you'll see
plated calipers. The bolts on my calipers are very rusty, so they should be
replaced anyway, for safety. Since I haven't taken a trip to my garage
recently, I don't have any specs on the bolts. I think they are M8's, but
that's just from a casual look at them. Any help would be appreciated!
