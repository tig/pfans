Look in the VW mags for ads.  There are several companies that make them
for VW's.  CB Performance makes several variations and has 914 intake
manifolds as one of the accesories.  Someone on one of the VW lists has
bought a CB system and is installing and posting reports on it.  I said I'd
forward his reports to this list but since then he hasn't posted any more.
He was in the early stages of figuring out where and how to best mount the
return line since non FI beetles didn't have one.

Get a CBPerformance catalog or look on their web site

Subject:  After market fuel injection system




I've heard that several companies are making after market fuel injection
systems for American engines.  Very popular with hot rodders.  Much better
power and fuel economy.
Does such a thing exist for 2.0 914 engines?  Has anyone had any experience
with them?  How much are they?  Where would somebody get one?
