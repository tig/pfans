Yeah, and when you walk away from 2.0L 911S on the straightaway, _someone_
will be asking for a tear down. Then you'll be bummin' big time. That's why
I want a 100% legal motor for my CSP car.

An interesting event occured this year which this reminds me of. At an SCCA
Pro Solo event this last year, there was a CSP Honda CRX that was holding
even with an AS BMW M3 in a drag race start. Needless to say, about 10
people ganged up and filed a very thorough protest. They fronted the tear
down bond, and the CRX owner (with witnesses) took the car to his shop,
tore down the engine and _everything_ was measured. Cam, crank, rods, bore,
pistons, valves, you name it. And you know what? He was _LEGAL_! The best
part about it was that he returned over half of the bond that was put up
for the tear down costs because he did most if not all of his own work. Can
you imagine how smug that must have made him feel? That, I think, is
probably one of the single most gratifying experiences an engine builder
can ever have. Yeah! If I ever get protested like that, I want to be found
legal.
