Has anyone out here put a '73 1.7 engine with side shifter into a '72?
I put a 2.0 in my '72 with a side shifter recently.

If so, do i need to replace the shifting mechanism, and does the engine
bar
mount up to the same holes?
Don mentioned the linkage.  I had a complete unit from the shifter back
and it bolted right in.  The firewall bushing is necessary.  The '72 has
a larger hole in the firewall.  You also must have the engine bar with
the hole in it and the proper later model engine mounts where the bar
bolts to the car.  My '72 had a rubber mounts, the later one's are
steel.  You can bolt the bar to the old mounts but your shift linkage
will not work (I know, I tried).  The steel mounts are inexpensive.  I
understand that you can also upgrade to a 911 rubber mount which lines
up properly if you wish to reduce vibration, but they are not cheap.

Also, what other differrences are there between 72 and 73?
My donor car was a '75 (though the engine in the '75 was originally from
a '73) and there a numerous little changes between those years.

Does anyone know when they changed from the glass faced gauges to the
plastic faced gauges?  Just curious.  My later plastic face gauges also
have a single blinker indicator, while my earlier gauges had two
separate indicators.  I used the later set because of the condition and
150 MPH speedo, but the wiring in the blinker circuit is different
somewhere in the cars wiring.

To all,

I haven't had a chance to post to the list in several months, but you can
advertise Porsches and Porsche related items (parts, literature, wanted, etc)
in PML for free. Our magazine comes out monthly and goes to a very targeted P-
car audience. Ads need to be to us by Jan 25th to be in the Feb issue which
will mail around the 10th of Feb. You can email them.

Thanks and regards,

Phil Van Buskirk, PMLetter@aol.com
