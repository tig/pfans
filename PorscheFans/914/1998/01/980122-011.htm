Re this whole thread on the (aggravating) rear calipers ...

Has anyone on the list checked out and/or had experience w/CB Performance
and their products?

http://www.cbperformance.com/

They are now offering a rear caliper upgrade for VWs that
_uses_a_914_rear_rotor_ (!).  This is a "sliding" OEM caliper (not fixed,
like the 914) with an integrated handbrake mechanism.  You might recognize
that such a rotor is perfect for a mechanical handbrake system because,
unlike a fixed caliper, where the hydraulics have to be part of the
handbrake mechanism, on these calipers the entire mechanism is external to
the (single) fluid cylinder.

IF CB were to offer a kit for the 914 rears (I would think just custom
cables and maybe an adpter would be required) I would be very interested. I
suspect other 914 listers might be, too.

Check out their "Rear Disk Brake Kit" with "Double Acting Caliper" under
PRODUCTS and "CB's Beautiful Binders" under ARTICLES AND REVIEWS on their
web pages. The latter is also also in Hot VW's January 1998.

<< You mean that "dimple" round dent on the caliper by the parking brake
 mechanism is a cover? Like a freeze plug maybe? Geez, they certainly did not
 want these things overhauled! >>

There is NO need to remove the cover , lever, and spring unless the shaft is
frozen, or you are sending the caliper halves out to be replated.  No need to
remove to rebuild the caliper.  Someone just asked how to remove the lever
without stating for what purpose.

<<   O.K., now Jon,  that was almost the first thing that I did after
 removing the spring.   The only problem is that mine is no more ready
 to come out now than it was before I removed the circlip.   I decided
 that since it was a junk caliper that it was O.K. to destroy it, so I
 tried to drift the lever shaft out with a 3/8" extension and my
 trusty knock-off hammer from my MG days.   Ietc. etc.>>

I assumed that ALL of the other guts of the caliper had already been removed.
All of the adjustment mechanisms, etc, including the oblong piece that the
lever shaft pushes on inside the caliper.  If the caliper guts aren't removed
after splitting the halves, you won't get the shaft out.

Hope this helps.
