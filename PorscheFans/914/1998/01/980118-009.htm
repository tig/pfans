It is easty to replace the cooler seals with the engine in the, basically
take off the passender side sheet metal. Losen the nuts holding the cooler
and slide back. take out old seals, REMBER HOW THEY CAME OUT,  I don't
remember which way they go back in. There are two sides to them. I used
some grease to hold them in place slide cooler back bolt up etc.
