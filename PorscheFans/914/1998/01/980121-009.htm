     Hi All,
     
        My inquiry about catalyst equipped 914/6's finally got a 
     informative response...but not from any Porsche list..actually, it was
     from the Ford Mustang Modular GT list of which I'm also a member.
     
     
        Anyhow, the question was "has anyone set up a 914/6 (conversion) 
     with CATs....?" and "how hot does the exhaust gas need to be to 
     properly 'light off' the cats".  I got a reply I'll share with the 
     list incase anyone else needs this type of info.
     
     
     
     Furnished by Catalytic Converter manufacturer:  
     
      Temperature at idle:  500 F measured 1" back from the face of brick,  
                              1" deep ( I take this to mean 1" upstream of 
                                        "face of brick", 1" deep into a 2"  
                                         tube so on center in the flow)
     
      Max temp:            1600 F
     
      Also, CO should be kept less than 2%, more can overheat and damage 
     the converter.
     
     
     
     Can any list member verify or disclaim this info?  Can anyone suggest 
     a second source?
     
     Experienced/Intelligent replies appreciated.
     
     
     
     
     My task is to pick the right cats to connect to Bursch Headers on my 
     '83 3.0 liter equipped '76 Ca. 914/6.  I am planning to ceramic coat 
     the headers (Jet-Coat) and wrap them in fiberglass tape if necessary 
     to bring the temperature up for optimal Catalyst operating 
     temperature.  
     
        The other "option" is to use the stock heat exchangers/cat/and 
     muffler from the complete SC engine, but I'd need to do a bit of 
     persuasion/modification/welding to get them to fit.  The SC exhaust 
     system has an inherent disadvantage in that all 6 paths to the Cat are 
     different length since the two unequal-length configured heat 
     exchangers are connected to the Cat on one side of the 
     engine.  My 3.0 (and for that matter, any SC) has lots of potential 
     power available with a simple balancing of the exhaust.
     
     
     Help/Useful observations are appreciated.
     
     Thanks
     
     Brian Mifsud
