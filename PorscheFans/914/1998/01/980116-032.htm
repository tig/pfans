    Mike:

    I know what you mean, but some Chalon kits actually look pretty
    good.

    Maybe I'm biased, but if you look at the for-sale ad on my web
    page, you'll see a Chalon-bodied car that looks, um, presentable.

    The Chalon kit IS difficult to install... It really requires the
    services of a VERY competent body shop, since -- unlike
    non-unibody cars like the Fiero, etc. -- you can't just unbolt
    the stock body panels and bolt on the new ones.

    There are some other issues, as well:

    1.  In many cases, a body kit's only put on a car after that car
        has been wrecked... The thinking is, "As long as I'm
        rebuilding the body anyway, I might as well do something
        exotic."

        Unfortunately, wrecked cars are, by definition, not in
        particularly good shape... So the body kits often don't fit
        real well when applied to those cars.

        Also -- again because it's a unibody -- the 914 depends to a
        large extent on its body for structural rigidity, so it's
        important to leave as much as possible of the original
        bodywork intact when you install the kit.  With wrecked cars,
        whole fenders and quarter panels are often removed
        entirely... So there's not enough structure to hold the car
        together and keep the fiberglass from flexing and then
        cracking. 

    2.  Even if the kit's installed on an intact car by a good 
        bodyshop, there are still some weaknesses that need to be
        addressed if you want to keep the kit looking good. 

        The biggest issue is the extremely-long front overhang... If
        you just install the kit as it's shipped from the factory,
        you'll find that it immediately cracks at the interface
        between the fenders and the front bumper-extension, because
        all that fiberglass is just hanging out in front of the car,
        supported by little more than itself.

        To fix this, you need to provide some sort of support for
        that overhang.  On my car, there's a BIG brace welded all the
        way across the front of the car behind the airdam, and the
        underside of the area between the fenders and
        bumper-extension has been reinforced with heavy fiberglass
        patches... It's kept the fiberglass from cracking, but even
        so, there's a fine hairline crack in the paint on each side.

        Those little cracks are hardly noticeable, and I know they
        aren't going to get any bigger or extend into the fiberglass,
        but they're still a little annoying... I console myself with
        the knowledge that my car's Chalon kit looks better than any
        of the other Chalon installations I've seen.
