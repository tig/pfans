    I'm also, one of those sometimes write to list guys. Been going
through some changes at home ie. new kid,
4 year old daughter, paying off debt.......   yadi yadi yadi.  Now
though I finally have a fuel pump on order
from Mesa in AZ. Cost me $115 + core for the rebuilt pump. Then it's off
to registration (have expired TX
plates from when I drove it from Corpus Christi to Loveland CO with an
intermittant, mostly not working,
starter problem and broken clutch cable tubing. Had to push start at
every gas pump. Then when I got to
Hobbs NM me and my grandfather put an angle bracket to butt the clutch
cable housing up against so I
could shift. Got stuck in Monahans TX at the last light before Hobbs
since I couldn't shift and just missed
the light so I had to get a push start. Thanks to the local police it
was off to Hobbs NM for me.)

     Next it's down to Boulder to get my clutch tubing welded by
Appleton's for $60 an hour for welding etc.
Have two problems with the clutch tubing that I know about: 1) there is
a semi circular tear in the firewall
where the clutch tubing is welded to the firewall and 2) now the front
end of the tube interferes with
the shift lever inside the tunnel housing so I have to position the
shifter then push in the clutch and
shift. Crazy stuff but I felt vicariously like Magnum PI with my top
down and during the summer
speeding down the road. I can't wait.

        One other thing I know about for now is before I drove the car
up to Loveland it didn't appear
to lean hunt though I didn't really notice so I don't think it did. So
now it does and I guess I need
to look into my head temp sensor and maybe do the resistor fix? I have
Pertronix points replacement
but if the valves are not properly adjusted can this cause lean hunting?
Something seems to have
changed. It seems to run well otherwise.
