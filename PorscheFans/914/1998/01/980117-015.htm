Yup. Those are the bias-ply tires. And Hoosier still makes them. They're
softer than the radial, and will heat up quicker. What's the tread
depth?

If you treat them with a tire compound they should be fine. However, the
bias-ply tire is not as tolerant of narrow rims as the radials (or BFGs)
are and will basically suck if you don't mount them on really wide rims.
I have been looking into the bias-ply autocrossers myself if I plan to
go to wider tires as I don't think the 914 weighs enough to sufficiently
heat up really wide BFGs at an autox. 

I doubt that tire will fit under stock fenders. I can _barely_ fit
225/50-14 BFGs on 6" rims under the only-for-a-little-while-longer stock
fenders. The nice thing is that the 225/50-14 is a very popular tire
size in the SCCA (Neon, Miata and MR2) and as such cast-offs are pretty
easy to come by.

If you decide that those autocrossers won't fit your needs, I'd like to
give 'em a try. :)

But hey, you're running in prepared! Why aren't you running on real
slicks?
