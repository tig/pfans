We had continual problems with engine lid hinge bracket failure as the
90 degree angle would crack causing the engine lid to move back and hit
the leading edge of the rear trunk lid.  Used ones were usually cracked
as well and were a hassle to cut off, sand blast off the old paint and
reinforce with some gloppy weld. Our solution was to spend the six
thousand bucks on the tooling and make a vastly improved, guaranteed for

life hinge we could offer for sale with confidence.  They look good, are

easy to install and paint, and cost 25 bucks each!
