Stellite. And I have never heard of valve _seats_ made from it -- valve
_tips_, more likely.  Seat wear isn't all that bad -- the most important
thing is for the seat and guide to conduct heat from the valve to the head.
There are some guide and seat materials out there now that are vastly
improved over the usual "silicon bronze" guides and cast-iron seats.

Getting stellite onto a valve's tip is not a trivial affair -- I've seen
valves where the stellite tip fell off, so whoever's doing the "tipping"
had better know what they're doing. Note that there isn't much heat at the
tip of a valve -- just a lot of pounding in a motor like the 914's (with
stock rocker arm tips -- swivel feet make the valve tip's life a lot
easier).
