	I have a couple of times gotten a bolt to "break" in the tighten
direction when I was sure that any more force in the loosen direction
would snap it off.  I have no clue why this works.  I just happened to
do it when I thought something must have been reverse threaded when
it wouldn't budge in the "loosen" direction.
