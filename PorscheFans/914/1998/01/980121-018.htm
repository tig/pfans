Californians:  A good reason not to move to Oregon (please ignore the sunny 
beach picture, that doesn't count!)  :)  Just kidding, I was born in Mt. 
View.

Gary:  Yep, the side view mirror is still level!

Non-purists:  The front airdam is the Flexdam from Automobile Atlanta.  A 
good fit and a great look.  The PORSCHE reflector on the rear is from 
Automotion.  Another sharp look but trunk release instructions were lacking 
in the release knob part and a couple of [minor] pieces of hardware 
missing.  Riviera rims: Uuuuhgleee!  Hmm, all she really needs are some fat 
tires stuffed under flared fenders supporting a six-banger!

At the time the pictures were taken we had just the snow storm...the ice 
came later on in the evening and locked her down!
