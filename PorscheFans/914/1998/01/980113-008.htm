I don't think there's a flaw at all, unless you consider the VW style
wege-shaped combustion chamber a "flaw" (which it really is, but all air
cooled VW motors have this "flaw"). Since the 914 motors were supposed to be
"high performance", they were spec'd with the cooler running sodium filled
exhaust valves. Regular VW motors in beetles, etc. were economy low
performance cars so they got regular steel exhaust valves. Based on the info
in Automotion, the SS valves may not be a bad way to go. The valves in
question are not simply made of stainless steel. They are more than that,
since they have hard chromed stems, and stellite on the tip and face. The
only info I have about thier durability is based on hearsay from others. If
it was me, I'd stick with the oem valves unless presented with some hard
data to the contrary (like an actual test showing valve temps between both
types).
