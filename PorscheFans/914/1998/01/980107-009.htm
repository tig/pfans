List members and all Porsche model owners:

I=92ve received many questions about the process, procedures and
techniques regarding MIG welding over the recent past.  This is written
for those brave enough to even consider welding their prized possession
=96 their 914.  While welding at first appears to be a =93black art=94, in
reality, it is a practiced talent =96 and a "talent" which is relatively
easy to learn and practice on a regular basis.

First, I have to add a disclaimer: Use what I write here at your own
risk and responsibility. Unfortunately, people occasionally make
mistakes (it=92s part of the learning process), but I can't assume risk
for their errors, nor can I assume risk for my mis-communications. If
you agree, then read on!  If not, well, just ignore this post!

My personal philosophy in authoring this post is to encourage others to
try things that other people do. Welding is one of those =93things=94. It is
not a hard =93thing=94 to learn. =96 it just takes a basic understanding of=
 the
proper procedures and a little practice.

Step 1: Safety But =93first things first=94 as they say.
The FIRST, and most important =93thing=94, is to be safe:
- Make certain that anything in the area around you that could possibly
ignite is removed entirely from that area.  =93Welding=94 means heat, sparks
and more sparks.  Things that could burn, will burn. And yes, that
includes your clothing and skin, if you=92re not careful!

- You must wear a long sleeve shirt, long pants without cuffs
(non-flammable, like cotton) and leather welding gloves.
- A good eye shield or welding hood must be used.

- Get a fire extinguisher and always have it nearby for immediate use in
that event it is necessary.

- NEVER MIG or ARC weld where water will be in contact with you or the
surfaces you are welding. This will electrocute you - welding YOU rather
then METAL!

- Use proper ventilation, as the fumes are harmful if welding in an
un-vented area. I usually leave the garage door open when welding and
then take a break away from the area till they expelled.

- Disconnect any and all major electrical components from the car, like
the battery, the alternator, etc. before attaching the welder. If you
weld with these attached, you might destroy them.


OK. So we have the safety bases covered (i.e. you won=92t burn up, your
car won=92t ignite, your garage will be intact after you start welding =96
and you'll have a fire extinguisher handy in case they do :-)

Step 2 =96 Getting Ready to Practice
When you are ready to start, practice welding on some scrap metal that
is close to the thickness of the body part you are going to repair. This
is usually 20 or 22 gauge =93stock material=94 which is available at auto
body parts stores, auto recyclers and metal scrap yards.  It is cheap.
Buy a lot of it.  Then buy some more.  This practice is essential and
will show up in your final effort.  NEVER - and I mean NEVER - practice
on what you intend to repair.  Practice materials are cheap =96 your car
is not (nor is paying someone else to fix it!).  And, by the way,
practicing on cheap stock is kind of fun without the fear of hurting
anything.

Step 3 =96 The Welding System
A MIG welder has 2 cables. One of them is the ground. It looks like an
alligator toothed clamp =96 like car =93jumper cables=94. This lead must be
attached either to the metal you intend to weld, or near the piece you
are welding for proper grounding.  MIG welders work on current flow, so
don=92t attach the ground at one end of the car and try to weld at the
other end.  The current would have to pass the entire length of the car
=96 impeding the =93arc=94 (more on this later).  The most important point
here is not begin welding without this cable attached near the point of
welding.

The other lead from the MIG welder is the =93business end=94 that has the
electrode and it=92s handle with the =93welder on=94 and wire feed button
(also, the tip will have a gas outlet if your MIG uses tanks). When you
press the button, wire (and gas, with a MIG with tanks) will be fed from
a spool in the machine through the feed line and to the handle you hold
in your hand and, as importantly - electricity will flow from that
electrode. Don=92t touch it when the button is on!

Just a short note about the different types of MIG systems =96 =93gas=94 and
=93gas-less=94.  A MIG with a tank attachment will force CO2/Argon into the
arc as the weld is being created. This gas help keep the air surrounding
the weld uniform =96 creating a better weld in the process.  The second
system (=93gas-less=94) uses a shielded wire electrode.  The outer coating
of this shielded wire creates its own gas as it burns in much the same
way a tank provides a gas source.  Either system is fine for light body
work!

Step 4 =96 Preparing the Surface
Electricity is a funny thing =96 it travels through clean metal best.  It
doesn=92t like rust, oil, grease or other contaminants.  Therefore,
preparing the surfaces to weld is as important as the weld itself.  To
prepare the surfaces, cut out all the rust and use a wire brush to clean
all the surfaces to be welded so that they are bright and shiny.  If
parts need to be primed, 3M makes a product called =93weld-through primer=94
which will conduct the electrical current while providing protection to
the bare metal. Follow the directions on the label and your finished
welds will look professional from the start.

Step 5 =96 Your First Weld
OK, so get on the proper attire, get your gloves, get your eye
protection handy. Ready? Let=92s go:

First, the procedure is pretty simple - when you press the switch on the
handle, you will strike an =93arc=94 (an electrical contact) between the
metal and the electrode protruding from your welding).  To start this
arc (kinda like lighting a match) hold the electrode about 1/8" from the
metal surface to be welded.  Once the arc is lit, a lot of stuff happens
pretty quickly =96 the metal gets really hot (molten), new metal is fed
from the electrode, and a =93puddle=94 forms on the work pieces. This puddle
is molten steel and is actually your weld.  In reality, when you weld,
you are joining metals within this =93puddle=94 and you=92re your welding
talent is gauged by your ability to control that puddle. Really, its
that simple (or that difficult, depending on your level of optimism at
the moment=85)

So go ahead - try it.  By the way, at precisely the moment you strike
the arc, the hooded shield that protects your eyes must be pulled into
place =96 or you won=92t see a thing.  The bright light will hurt your eyes
(not a good thing as you will see =93stars=94 for days or worse, could cause
more permanent eye damage.). You might want to practice just pulling the
hood into place when you touch the metal without power on until you feel
your eyes will be safe from the light. Again, this is imperative for eye
protection. Practice doing this until you feel comfortable that it is
done correctly. Another option is to hold the electrode in place, pull
on the hood, and then start the arc.  Either is fine as long as your
eyes are covered when you begin to weld. (BTW: You will see everything
as you weld even though you can=92t see through the shield under natural
light. The welding process is REALLY bright. And before raising the
shield, make certain that you move the tip away from the grounded metal
to stop welding.)

Step 6 =96 Techniques and Welds Types
My specific technique is to weld in short welds. Generally about 1/8"
spots. Start by doing one in the middle of the entire length. Next tack
each end. Then eyeball a spot midway between the middle spot weld and
the end.  Do the other direction likewise. This is called stitching. It
maintains the straightness of what you are welding. Do this until you
have a line of spots from one end to the other. Don't concentrate too
much heat in one spot is the idea. Let the entire work piece cool after
stiching. (I drink a coke or whatever and come back and inspect of what
I have done during the previous session - typically, I consume a case of
the stuff on really big jobs :-).

Spot or Tack Welding: To create a tack, hold the electrode in an area
for no more than 2 or 3 seconds. Hold tip in one spot about 1/8" above
the metal. Too long will burn a hole in metal. Proceed to next position
for the next tack or spot, on and on.  Spot and tack welding can be done
on a seam or though holes made in the overlaid stock to be attached.

Creating A Seam or Butt Weld: When you are doing long seams, your hand
motion will be in small oval movements.  These movements are like small
circular motions away from you one side on the work piece and toward you
on the other.  Remember that you are actually moving a molten puddle of
metal along a predetermined path.  Think of it a =93fanning or pulling a
drop of water=94 =96 it=92s pretty much the same principle. Keep repeating
this motion into the joining metals about 1/8" to 3/16" from the top of
previous circular always working toward your standing position. Never do
this type weld without tacking the entire length with spots no more than
6" apart maximum.  Here is the best diagram I can draw in e-mail

you             handle   =3D +  positive lead
_______\__________ <-----direction of welding motion
metal   =3D  -- ground lead

 BTW: A solid weld along the seam is not always necessary. Use what you
see on the part that you are going to be repairing on the 914 to be a
practical guide on which weld type to use. And remember, heat will
distort metal. Too much is worse than too little. It will also weaken
the metal. Dwelling too long at one point will burn a hole that will
have to be welded later to accomplish good appearing work as you will
want your 914 to have.

 Summary - a short version of the procedures

 -Put gloves on.

-Clamp metal to be welded with c-clamps to retain their movement.

-Clamp the ground to the metal.

-Set the amperage switch on the welder to proper amps. Should be
instructions that came with your welding system.

-Turn on welding machine.

-Have shield on and comfortable fit.

-Stand or sit where you see the 2 pieces of metal you will join by
welding are directly in front of you and be prepared to pull shield over
your eyes at the precise moment of contact.

-Now, position the handle with tip about 1/8" from the surface of the
metal and along the joining edges of the 2 pieces of metal, pull shield
down quickly with one hand while pressing the switch on the handle with
the hand that holds it.

-Bright glow on contact begins the welding process. Extremely HOT. Never
touch what you are welding with bare hands. It will burn your hand and
if like me, cause you to swear.

-Work slowly and never get in a hurry. Speed will come with experience.

-You should keep this 1/8" gap between the metal and the tip constant
and move the tip in a direction toward you along the gap and maintain
about a 15 or 20 degree angle of the handle in relation to the working
surfaces.


You can do it.  Practice, practice, practice. And Have FUN with it!
Wishing you success.

Dirk: For some reason I remember something about a galvanizing compound that
you used (porschefans list). I want to re-do the galvanized finish on the a/c
condenser on my 914. I looked at the latest Eastwood catalog and couldn't fnd
anything so thought I would try you. BTW thanks for the info on using
Correless. I was about to start the project until you told me that it needed
50 degree temps. I also noted in the Eastwood catalog a product called
Alumblast. I was wondering if the stuff would be good to re-do the intake
manifold pipes. Have any experience with the stuff?
Thanks
