Sometimes this is good, depending on the situation:

While away at college, my mother decided to go to DMV to take my
application for my NH driver's license to the NH registry. Seems she
mixed up the year of the Date Of Birth with my older brother's by two
years

No problem on my end - I had a LEGAL NH License that I could go to
"public drinking places" 2 years before any of my college buddies.. 
Have I changed it? I tried only once (of course, *well* after the age of
21 :-).  They told me that they didn't believe me, and to prove it, had
to go get my birth certificate and pay $50...  It never got changed -
who cares - when I die, it'll be two years after I was supposed to,
according to NH....
