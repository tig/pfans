I've been running the new Yoko A032R 205/50/15's
in the front and 225/50/15's in the back on 7&8in.
revolution race wheels. I ran them HARD all last 
summer, about 3000 miles, and the tread is only
only about 1/2-3/4's gone. Yes on the highway
they can be noisy, but they do start to quiet
after a while, that or I just got used to them! 
But really with my exhaust - a modified Bursch - 
it was hard to hear them droan. And they stick like
glue, they're more than enough for street driving
and the occasional track event. Infact at the track
event I ran this year the car was the fastest there,
beating a bunch of 944's, 6 new 911 turbos and an 
older 911 turbo S!! Anyways for the price they're 
a great deal, I'm more than happy. 

I missed the Christmas get to know your fellow
914er, so here's my belated profile. My name's
Robert Sutherland, and I live in Toronto, Ontario.
This is my first car, I know, pretty nice first
car...It all started out as a tame bone stock
75 1.8 with 65,000 miles on it. As you'll see
we tore the car apart and the only rust we found
was in the battery tray.  Once my dad and I got 
hold of the car things started to get crazy,
things like, "it needs paint so if we want to 
put on flairs this is the time to do it... and 
these bumpers are heavy lets get 'glass ones, 
or, while we're buying fiberglass stuff lets get
fiberglass trunk lids. So we decided to turn it into
a street going 914 GT. We did the suspension, big 
torsion and sway bars, 160 pound springs ect. Then
we got the new big wheels to fill out the flairs.
After that it was lets make the interior black, so
incame new carpets, two Sparco buckets, and Scroth
4 point harness, new door panels and vinyl. As we all
know stock 914's don't stop, so we thought lets put
really big brakes on it, but by then we had bought 
the revolution wheels, 4-bolt wheels, so we had 
4-bolt hats put on 944 turbo S rotors, since these
are based on 911 turbo brakes we have in essence
911 turbo brakes. Now the only thing really stock
is the engine, and as soon a we can find a good
2.4-2.5 160 bhp four that will be gone too.

By the way my license plate reads 9I4 GT,
the reason for the "I" is that in Ontario you can't 
have three numbers on a personalized plate because
it looks too much like a normal one.
