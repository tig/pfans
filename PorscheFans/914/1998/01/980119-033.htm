Mike,

My car uses factory 13mm nuts, which are, believe it or not, even harder to
get at than your 12mm ones!   I usually tap (read: hammer)  the socket in
place with a hammer and a 6" extension, then you can get a 1/4" handle on
it.  It helps if you first spray with liquid wrench or similar penetrating
fluid (not WD-40).  Once the socket is hammered gently into place, you can
easily get it off.  Getting it back on, however, is another story
altogether.

I've always had good luck with two 1/4" drive tools.  I use a Snap-On 13mm,
1/4" drive, 6pt socket.  This is the thinnest, strongest socket you can buy,
about $8.  The 2nd tool is a Snap-On 6" wobble extension, 1/4" drive.  The
wobble extension is really neet, and saves lots of grief, especially with
this job.  $15.   I'm not sure about the prices, I've had mine for many
years.

cheers, Brian Ng
