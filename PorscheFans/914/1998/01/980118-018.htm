List,

I have a couple of GOOD computer items for sale. I am needing the money to
buy some much needed 914 parts. MO = money order. All prices are set in
concrete, very firm. No trades. These are my own personal items I am selling.

A Canon Powershot 350 digital camera. $375 MO includes postage. Has been
used 4 times. Sells new for $499. Would be great for anyone going to
Monterey. Includes 2mb storage chip. No film is ever needed with this
camera. Will interface with PC, MAC or TV. Includes Mac and PC CD ROM
software & all connectors. INTERFACES thru PC serial port and MAC video input.


An Intel P54 166mzh CPU. $110 MO includes postage. You will need a
motherboard which supports Pentium class chip. PC COMPATIBLE. Is not MMX CPU.

A Western Digital 2.1 gigabyte IDE Hard drive, 3 1/2 size. No bad sectors.
$140 MO includes postage. PC COMPATIBLE.

Send me PRIVATE e-mail if interested. CPU & HD are in use on my computer as
I write this. Camera is not interfaced to my system as I have nothing that
would be interesting to show others at this time, including my 70 914 1.7.

ALL are used, but I promise, in excellent condition.
