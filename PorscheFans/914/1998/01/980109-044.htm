All List Members.
Saw a post on the list. Contacted the writer. Timo Pantsari is seeking some
memories written by Porsche owners at their new Finland site. Said he only
had one response to his post. Guess who it was? Not Elvis.

PORSCHE .. Posting Our Real Support Can Help Everyone.

This is the time for all of us to remember some of the good times we have in
our Porsche. Or bad times. Model or condition does not matter. Let help
PorscheHQ this weekend at their new Web address.
His post if you want to read was on 1/7/98. Front of a bunch.

Prepare NOW some story of your ownership and when Tomi posts this Sunday,
show him what 914 owners have. The Best list in the World. I am going to
post even if I have to make some of it up. My memory is not like our
computer. Mines forgets somethings. Actually my best memories are right
here, with all of you.
