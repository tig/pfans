Hi P- Fans,

I was about to send my heads in to MSHP for the "works" (including
the SS valves ), when I read the message below. I am now wondering
if the choice of using SS valves instead of the regular steel ones
is a good one.  Actually, I don't really know what the advantages or
disadvantages of each type is. Can someone out there clear this
up for me?  I believe that all the hot VW engine builders use SS valves.
It may be because of price (they are inexpensive) and or availability.
All I know is that discovering pieces of valves inside my valve covers
after only 4900 miles is a scary thing. I would not like this to happen 
to my engine and I am very curious to learn what caused these valve tips 
to mushroom. I wonder if a problem or a misadjustment in the hydrolic
lifter setup could have caused this problem to occur.
I invite anyone who has had any experience ( good or bad ) with MSHP, to
drop me a line. TIA

Michel
