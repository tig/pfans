All list members:

Want more 914 related tutors? Name a subject. This will have to be a list
effort. Not just a person or two. I know all subjects can be explored and
accomplished when we all work together, step by step, as a group.
Accumulations of methods include many factors. Lets get these all together,
hack and edit them as necessary. Proof them with experience and write them
in a step at a time procedure. Personally I would like to see one on
upholstery as most are needing this done. If someone else does it, you can
do it if you have a guide and are willing to learn.

This is your list. Make it what you want and need by being involved.
