Kyle,
Thanks for your added compliment to the tutor.
As I wrote, this was a tutor for learning mig welding.
Very condensed and written to show how to get started. I am certain that
many who read your post will learn much about integral strength which is
necessary and true. Todays high prices demand that individuals learn to
accomplish things they may not have considered before. I bet you and all
that read these posts have done this.
 
If I can do, anyone can. I am not dumb, but persistance pays if others think
you are when it comes to doing what they do. I am not smart. If I were, I
still would not mind learning how to do something others do.


I again state, Welding is not hard to learn. I do not think that anyone who
reads the tutor is stupid and realizes that when you weld metal together,
you are doing so to accomplish strength by the fusion. No other reason.

Thanks for your addition.

Mike Cooley

I don't mean to harp on anyone and I don't know much about how it works or how
to fix it, but it really ruins my day to find out that I can't download my 914
digest and find out what all my friends are up to. It's that windmail.dat crap
that aol won't turn into mail when I download it. Sorry to any I haven't
replied to--didn't know you wrote.
