I know you all seem to be looking for the factory
perfect dash, when I got my car a few years ago
my dash was in pretty bad shape too. However instead
of refinishing or getting a new one I went the cheap
way. I got a dash cap from Automotion. NO this is not
one of those ugly carpet panels, it's a hard plastic
cap that goes over the whole dash. I'm more than happy
with it, there's no sign of fading, infact most of the
time I forget it's there. I took it into a body shop
and THEY didn't even notice that it was there!! So for
about $100 I'm more than happy, and if anything happens
to it I'll just yank it off and stick a new one on it.
