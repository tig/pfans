Hey, has anyone been following the storm the Northwest received over the 
weekend?  For Oregon is was sorta nasty (I know, I know, nothing like the 
Right Coast, but we're not used to it!).

Anyway, my pooooor baby was literally frozen under a 1/2" layer of ice, 
bonded to the driveway (I'll post picture to my web site later).  Me and my 
roommate (NOT girlfriend) were finally able to break away the ice today as 
temperatures are quite a bit warmer and proceed to work.  The sun broke out 
and it was so beautiful!  My roommate said it sure would be real cool to go 
topless (referring to my Porsche and not to herself) so I pulled over and 
we took the top off.  WOW!  For the next 8 miles all we did was smile and 
laugh in the sunlight as everyone else drove my in their stuffy, closed car 
and stare at us!  We had an absolute blast driving through the slush, ice 
and snow and had the stupidest silly grins the whole way.  I dropped her 
off at her site and I continued to mine where I had a police car drive past 
from the opposite direction and both officers waved to me -- of course I 
grinned even more and proudly waved back with my hand protruding far past 
the roof line.

Don't we have da coolest rides or what?!
