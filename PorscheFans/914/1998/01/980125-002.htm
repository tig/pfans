I have a V8 in mine.  There are times, shhh, when I like to run it up
into the low hundreds.  I have also found that it gets light in the
front.  I have put my tool box in the front and have the radiator up
there, should help.  On the other hand the radiator dumps air out on the
ground from the bottom of the front trunk.  This is not good.  I have
been thinking of putting a damper to direct the air back and also make
it adjustable from within the car so I can choke it down at high
speeds.  Right now I have an air dam that goes to about 2" from the
ground.  I am repainting the car and am thinking of reshaping the
fiberglass part of the air dam the part about 4" below the bumper.
right now it only has a slight curve.
When you said a deep air dam what did you mean?  A further description
or pictures would be helpful.  So would any other thoughts.  Thanks
Bill S.
