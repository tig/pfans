You usually need a puller. They can become "bonded" over time. You also need
an O ring, as I recall. As far as re-installation goes, I put anti-seize on
the hub/crankshaft mating surfaces, but I think it's a tossup as to whether
you should use anit-seize or locktite on the threaded fasteners. I used
anti-seize, but on second thought, locktite may be more appropriate, since
it is a semi-permanent assembly.
