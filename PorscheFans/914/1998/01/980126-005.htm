	(Hey, Dave--your mailer seems to like to insert lots of blank lines
between your paragraphs.  Can you look into fixing that?  Not a critical
problem, just a slight annoyance.)

	Depends on what you are trying to do.  If you are "diddling" your
mixture and want to play around, the pot is the right way to go.  If you
know what resistance in the circuit is correct to make your car run cor-
rectly, then you can put a fixed resistor in.  There is less chance of any-
thing going haywire with a fixed resistor.
	The CO adjustment on the computer is for the idle only.  Anything
that affects the overall mixture (head temp resistance, fuel pressure,
manifold pressure sensor tweaking) will also affect the idle mixture.  To
set it correctly requires either a well-trained ear, or a CO meter.

	If it's all the way in, you probably have air leaks somewhere in
your intake system.  Check everything that goes "after" the throttle plate.
Vaccuum hoses get old and start to leak or crack, the manifold itself can
crack, the seal between the throttle body and the manifold can be bad (if
it's been taken apart, at least), the seals between the intake runners and
heads can leak, the big hoses between the manifold and intake runners can
go bad and crack...  Or, your Aux Air Regulator could be stuck open.  Or
your decel valve.  To check those, you can use some vise-grips to squeeze
closed the vaccuum line leading from the component to the manifold.  If the
idle drops, there is a leak somewhere in that circuit.  (For the AAR, wait
5-10 minutes until the motor is warmed up--it's supposed to let air through
when cold.)
	If your idle is at or below 1000 RPM with the idle screw all the
way in, the air leak in question is probably pretty small.  So you'll
have to check carefully if you want to find it.  Just remember that most
of these leaks are letting unfiltered air into your engine.  Not *much*
dirt and crap will get in, but more will than if all the air were passing
through the air filter.
