Now that's the best idea I've heard in a long time.  I'll even fake the
CRS syndrome, if it'll bring me free parts - but I'm afraid I don't have
to.  (CRS= Can't Remember Sh.t)

Are you guys gonna' embarrass me into going to the Seca?  I'm just not a
spectator.  Watching somebody else have fun - bores me.  However,
getting to meet a lot of you would be a super thing.   

#1 son lives in Marina, just up the road, so I have free lodging.  
He goes to Cal State Monterey Bay and lives there on the old Fort Ord in
ex-mil housing.   Since he has been in college 10 years, he may be gone
by next summer.  However, it has given me an idea.  The housing is now
being run by a private contractor, and we may be able to make a deal for
rooms for that weekend.  They house prospective students for orientation
during the summer, so they are equipped for short-term renters.  Will
ask my son to investigate, if I can remember. :)

Win/lose:  Last summer I bought a box of '75-76 smog parts from Jim T.,
just on the hunch I would maybe gonna' need 'em someday.  That someday
may be at hand.  OTH, a year or so ago I sold a '75-76 exh manifold to
somebody on this list.  Now it looks like I may need one.  Oh, well.

Cheers,
rd
	Will apply for license plate "CRS" if I think of it next week.

to contact for further information.  I just read Don's inquiry on costs and he
