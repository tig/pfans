So whats the deal with these blue Ion bulbs ?? they sound cool, I have
noticed some cars on the road with blueish lights...anyone know ?? IS it

just the latest headlights out ???

I believe you are talking about the blueish headlamps such as on the
Benzs, Licolns and Bimmers which are high intensity descharge (HID)
technology.  Blue ion is on some accessory lighting and is different.
Then again, if you are referring to the blue ion, ignore what follows.
;-)

The new headlamps are not  really blue in color as much as conventional
headlamps that we are all used to are just very yellow.  The purer light
just appear blue in comparison.

PIAA now offers a H.I.D. driving light (accessory lighting), check
out...

....so, there really is no reason a standard size replacement headlight
couldn't be made.  PIAA's balast isn't too big, and I am sure a balast
could be made which simple plugs in between the wiring harness and bulb
or right inside the front trunk.  Now the bad news; look at the price of
the PIAA.  $1900.00 ouch!  Granted PIAA is on the high end of pricing,
but how much less expensive could someone else make one for???
