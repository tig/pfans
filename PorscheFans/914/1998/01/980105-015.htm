Actually, there are heat requirements for a couple of reasons - first,
the bare metal and paint should be at fairly uniform temperatures
(depends on what you are spraying) within the span of temp ranges. Two
part epoxy primers, single stage, etc. all have various requirements. 
Second, the three days of heat after spraying is for proper curing, and
again, dependent on what you're priming with.  Also, keep in mind that
humidity is a factor as well, and you should spray on low humidity days
(yes, even in winter).

In any case - air-borne, atomized, flammable paint/primer particles are
*not* (read "DON'T DO IT!") a good thing to mix with any spark or
flame.  If its possible, your heat source should be in a different,
separate, enclosed room with its own source of ventilation. You can duct
the heat into your spray area with a short run of hot air furnace
ducting (and place a furnace filter over its outlet to minimize dust). A
very good quality respirator (one designed for body/paint work) is an
absolute requirement.

Finally, while enclosing a heat source and ducting it might seem like a
royal pain in the backside, the problem is that while you are spraying
and then exhausting the fumes to be able to re-start the heat - the
temperature inside can drop out-of-range very quickly (especially in
colder regions). In fact, the temperature of the metal that you're
spraying will drop faster then the temp of the primer (not a good thing
- especially if you start on one part of the car at 70 degrees and your
last panel is at 40 degrees.).  Additionally, to exhaust the area until
there is absolutely no trace of fumes might take additional hours
depending on the size of the spray area.

In short, I live in a cold region as well and typically wait till there
is a two day forecast of 50+ degree weather to spray. And, BTW, after an
initial 12 hour cure time, most primers become more tolerant to
temperature fluctuation.

Good luck!

Hey all,

        I have been informed by my mechanic that I need new CV joint(s).  I
hear a noise that only seems to come from the right side of the car.  But he
says that it is possible all four are worn out. With CV joints @ 90$ each,
plus labor, this could end up being a seriously expensive bill.  From reading
the past posts, it seems that you can take a worn out CV joint from the right
side of the car, and swap it with one on the the left side of the car.  About
how much mileage do you get out of the swap versus just replacing? 
        If BOTH sides of the car need new CV's, then it would be econmically
smarter to do the swap, than buy new ones, cause you would have  had to pay
the labor to take apart various parts of the drive train's on BOTH sides.
But, if only ONE side of the car has CV joints that need to be replaced, would
it be more expensive in labor to do the swap?  Cause there would be all that
extra labor to take out the CV joint, on the other side, that did not need to
be replaced.  So basically what I am saying is, about how long does it take a
good mechanic to take out (one or both) CV's on a given side?  Is it only
beneficial to do the swap if BOTH sides need replacing?

PS: please don't respond saying I should do the work myself myself, cause I
won't!
