Dion I think you were asking about the megaphone or stingers that are in the =
Perf Prod catalog. I have a set of these and can give you first hand =
knowledge about them. First and foremost they are DAMN LOUD and I mean LOUD. =
At most autoxes you will most likely not get buy with them unless you can =
convince the coordinators that you are just like a Mod car...The only people =
that like them are the 10 to 13 year old that come up and say Cool car =
man!... These are definately not for the street..think LOUD and =
ticket...They are very good for top end performance as the engine will rev =
much more freely and you will see and increase in rpms and top end....but as =
Josh noted the bottom end performance suffers...so for club racing ok but =
autox not really unless you do this modification to get back pressure... =
What I have done is to get a pair of Supertrap megaphone units....you have =
to cut the cookie cutter piece out of the megaphone end and then install the =
Supertrap unit...very straight forward job. This then gives you the need =
back pressure for low end performance....and as with most changes you have =
to experiment with the number of disks to add or take out depending on your =
intake system...they are still loud but not like the airplane engine noise =
of the open ones....the other thing is that they are very hot and if you =
don't look out you or another person may burn the crap out of a =
shin....really sucks in the summer with shorts on....
Bottom Line is: If you want top end RPMs that almost don't quit ....read =
this as you really can go until the engine blows then this is the thing for =
you.For Autox, you will need the Supertrap modification for bottom end.... =
For street...absolutly NOT !!! waste of money.
Just my $.02 worth of a real world experience.

I had a bad rash the other day from my chin to the middle of my chest...I
did'nt know what it was nor could I get rid of it,,, so I went to the
hospital, they did'nt know what it was either but gave me some chicken soup
and it went away!!

the rash took away serious time working on my 1978 914-8..(the only one in
existance, Ferry made it for his son, Fruity)..feeling better, I got some
40-80 multi-weight oil and put it in the car, unfortunately I put it in the
wrong hole, I put it in the automatic tranny (a up dated 917 race
tranny)..after draining the whole mess out I went  back to the hospital for
lunch..more on my car and health later
