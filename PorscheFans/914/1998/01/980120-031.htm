	I noticed that my car has a natural resonance right around
3400 RPM.  I think it's called "booming".  It's not so bad now, but
was really bad with the previous muffler, and not noticable at all
with the original.  Unfortunately 3400 is about ideal cruise for me.
The sound is usually drowned out by wind noise with the top off.  I'm
usually a little deaf (and fatigued) after a long drive.
