Chris:

I don't have a web source for you, but I think I can explain it
pretty well...

As of 1 Jan 1998, all model-year-1973 or earlier cars are exempt from 
emissions testing.  That means no biennial testing AND no testing 
when you sell the car.

Beginning on 1 Jan 2004, this exemption will be extended to all cars 
30 or more years old... And it'll be a MOVING 30-year window, so 
1974 cars will be exempt starting in 2004, 1975 cars will be exempt 
in 2005, etc.

There's just one caveat to all this:  The "year" of your car, for 
emissions-testing purposes, is still determined by the NEWER of the 
chassis and engine... That is, stock 1973 cars are exempt, but if you 
put a 1983 motor in your 1973 car, it's technically treated as a 
1983 car, and won't be exempt until the year 2013.

However, the chances of the DMV discovering that you've done the 
engine swap are EXCEEDINGLY low... So for nearly all people, the fact 
that your chassis VIN number says that your car's a '73 will be 
enough to get the emissions-testing exemption.
