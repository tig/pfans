Hi Dirk and you too, Jon!

   I am somewhat confused by what you two gentlemen wrote, especially
in view of the fact that I just spent the last couple of hours out in
the garage beating on my junk caliper.

   This is in line with my experience, but first let me include Jon's
comments:

   O.K., now Jon,  that was almost the first thing that I did after
removing the spring.   The only problem is that mine is no more ready
to come out now than it was before I removed the circlip.   I decided
that since it was a junk caliper that it was O.K. to destroy it, so I
tried to drift the lever shaft out with a 3/8" extension and my
trusty knock-off hammer from my MG days.   I succeeded in beating up
the end of the shaft and the bore it rides in a little bit, but could
not remove the shaft.   I discovered that the shaft was operating
against something like internal spring pressure, and when I got it
about 3/4" out of the caliper, it would spring back.   No amount of
force that I could apply with a fairly heavy hammer could persuade
the shaft out any further than that, and in fact, during the attempt,
I caved in the bore for the adjuster gear drive screw so that I had
to tap that back into place with a hammer also, and now, while it
turns in there, it too is stuck in the caliper.  

   This tells me that there is some projection on the shaft which is
larger than it's bore, and that trying to force the shaft out of the
caliper deformed the casting slightly in the thin part above the
adjusting screw.   Jon, I'd be very interested in a detailed
description of how you got yours out, and what it looked like after
you got it out.  Specifically, the position of the lever while it was
being extracted (degrees relative to the caliper centerline) and
amount of force required.    Also a detailed description of the shape
of the camming surface.   If you can remember any details, it would
be of enormous help.

   I assumed that removing the pin that limits the travel of the
lever and shaft assembly would allow it to be turned past it's normal
stops, thereby dis-engaging it from the adjuster screw in the piston
bore, and allowing one or the other (or both) to be removed.   Alas,
with the pin removed, I could find no "magic" spot where the lever
could be extracted.   I noted that the lever drives the threaded
adjuster in the center of the piston bore in BOTH directions,
implying a very positive interconnection between the lever shaft and
the adjuster.   Further complicating the issue is the fact that the
lever shaft appears to be on the exact center line of the caliper.  
I can easily visualize a mechanism for camming the adjuster in the
"in" direction only from a centerline position, but being able to
positively drive it in BOTH directions is more difficult.   Almost
any mechanism that I can imagine that would do this would be rather
complicated and difficult to manufacture, and even more complicated
and difficult to dis-assemble.   Hence the request for data on what
the shaft looks like.

   Any further comments from  Dirk, Jon, or anyone else on the list
would be greatly appreciated.

					Thanks,
                                                            Jim T.
