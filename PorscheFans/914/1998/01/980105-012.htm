Since today is kinda slow on the 914 list, I figured I'd take the time
to let everyone know how my 914 project is coming along after close to 4
weeks of 'fourteen ownership. In reality, this post should make all who
own RUNNING 914's feel pretty good about their cars... (BTW: It was 52
degrees in NH this weekend - and my "topless", "engine-less",
"interior-less", "suspension-less" 914 stood on jack stands in the
garage.)

As you may recall, "certain list members" (last names withheld to
protect their identity from retribution, but with first names like
"Mike", "Mark", "Dave", "Josh", "Dirk", etc...) encouraged me to buy a
914 - to share in the unparalleled "joys" of 914 ownership. So I looked
for one. So I found one. So I bought one. So you folks all congratulated
me and told me to keep you posted on the progress.... My only means of
revenge for your encouragement is the ability to post boring progress
reports like this one....

Remember I told everyone on the list during those first couple of days
of ownership that it was virtually "rust free"? In retrospect, I must
have been - well, "confused". I discovered that there isn't any such
thing as a "rust free" 914. I now absolutely believe they left the
factory with rust.  The factory just painted over the rust to the
customer's color choice... That explains the wide range of "70's disco"
914 colors - it's because there was rust under even the primer coat. In
fact, it was a factory manufacturing flaw that marketing turned around
as a *feature*....

And here is a compilation of my most (well, actually "only") positive
and motivating thoughts regarding this 914 project (big grin :-)

- Before the 914 entered my life, I had a lot of "idle time" with the
family, kids, sleep, career, etc. I now understand these were mere
distractions to life (read "914 restoration");
- I now feel compelled to teach welding classes as I am able to ramble
on about "weld-through primer", arc vs. mig, etc.;
- I invested heavily in the company that produces POR 15 before I became
a 914 owner - and as of today, I believe they should post a profitable
quarter based on my recent purchases of their products;
- My local Porsche Dealer is actually disappointed when I *don't* call
at 8:30 every morning to look up the parts I've broken the night before
(typically these part numbers begin with "NLA" - whatever that
means...);
- I believe that my 914 is now lighter then Mike Nugent's (of course,
his is drivable while mine is not even "pushable");
- I actually found an engine under the mass of vacuum hoses, FI parts
and sheet metal this weekend. The only two pieces of bad news are that
even the "jugs" are (appropriately) rusted, and someday, I might
actually have to re-assemble all the parts I took off without labeling
them;
- I feel a special closeness to Jerry Seinfeld in both our love of
Porsches and discovering American Express really doesn't have a pre-set
spending limit as I order more "NLA" parts;

Oh yea, since this is a list where I am supposed to ask questions - here
is mine. Has anyone ever *actually* gotten one of these things put back
together?

Happy New Year to all...

John Dunkle
