Toby,

I had the same problem with mine last year before I finally replaced my
rear springs.  I put
140# springs on mine, and it straightened right up.  Mine has been in an
accident, and the right rear was hit pretty hard and has lots of bodywork
into it (naturally found when I stripped the car).  I was afraid that was
the problem, but it turned out to be an old, original spring.

The left tire pointing in could be a broken suspension mount, but the right
side had more of a problem with rust and breakage than the left side due to
the battery tray and associated leakage.  Still, check all around the
suspension arm mounts for cracks and rust.  Also, if you can see the
busshings, make sure they aren't tore up or wearing down.  This might also
throw you off a little.

How do I know?  I just spent the last few night taking apart my rear
suspension and removing the control arms.  A real fun job on a 25 year old
car!

Good luck,

Dion
