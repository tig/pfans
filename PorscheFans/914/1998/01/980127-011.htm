	Of course, you'll need the engine.  You will also want the FI--
everything from the air filter housing to the injectors and fuel rails.
Basically, everything that is "on top of" the motor.  (This includes
stuff like the MPS, the decel valve, fuel pressure regulator, wires,
hoses, etc.)  Also the ECU, the "brain".  The relay board in your car
should work fine, though you may have to track down a little bit of
wiring.
	You can use your current exhaust--it will bolt right up.  You
may also want to go to the 2.0 exhaust--it does flow a little better,
and was deisgned for the 2.0.  In that case, you'll need the heat ex-
changers, the muffler, and the muffler bracket that hangs off the end
of the transmission.

	Walker Aumann did a (dead) 1.8 -> 1.7 swap, so he probably has
more ideas about the L-jet FI to D-jet FI swaps.
