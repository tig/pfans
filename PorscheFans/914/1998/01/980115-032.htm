Thanks to all who give advice on their "Rustorations". I fully intend to fix
my passenger side with help from my welding friend. As we are brewing a batch
of beer together again, I might have to keep us off the sauce while we do the
work, but that shouldn't be to hard. If I'm lucky, he'll break out the 65
Austin Heally 3k and we can dirve it to lunch while the 14 is cooling!

Praise be to all the lurkers. I feel like I ask more questions than giving of
answers, but we're all learning more all the time. Someday, I'll have the
advice all seek, I hope. It always suprises me to see that there are over 500
of us on here. Let's hear from lurkers and "newbies" more often. Sometimew, we
all forget about our little nagging problems that we didn't realize were
problems till somebody else mentions it. There are a lot of topics we haven't
said much about here. 

I have no intention of getting rid of my current 14, but our receptionist
found a new one for me on the way to work. It's just there---all the time. Had
a for sale sign on it, but somebody pulled it off. Parked kind of out of the
way, but on a reasonably busy arterial. Tabs from Oct. 95. I am suprised it
hasn't been towed. I jotted down the license, but now I can't figure out how
to find the owner. I would like to make an offer---get it off his/her hands ;
) Anybody have an ideas on tracking an owner? The barkeep nearby says it's
been there "forever". 

I just lost one of my lowbeams--right side. Not a fuse or anything. Finally,
an H4 that wore out. I ordered some Blue lights from AA (80/100). Kinda
pricey, but I know I'm not the only one of us who actually gets excited when
something wears out cuz it gives me an excuse to get something new. If I
remember correctly, the Muir idiot book tells the procedure for aiming at a
wall at a chalk line. I remember going to the supermarket years ago in my 65
Microbus to aim my headlights one night. Should the dimensions in there for
height and distance from the wall apply? The bus lights are mounted quite a
bit higher and you can't outdrive the headlights like you can on the 14. I
also better wire up the relay I ripped out of my old 914. Anybody got a
Procedure? The relay is a square Hella and I simply cut it out of the wreck
with no diagram.
