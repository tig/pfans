Brad,
Many are helpful with your questions and their answers are 100% correct.

I will say this in order to help. A picture is worth a thousand words.

Pictures I speak of are the illustrations of these various components that
will make up the total longitudinal support.

1. Rocker - the piece that runs along both sides of the 914 could and is
called by many, the longitudinal support.

2. Sill Threshold Plates - This is what is beneath the chrome lookings piece
that you mentioned. It is spot welded to the top side of the Rocker.

3. Inner Rocker Replacement Panel - This is welded to the Rocker on the
outside of the original Rocker to keep sag from occurring due to rust that
has rotted the original Rocker. Outside means as you are STANDING when you
are opening door.

4. Jack Post & Support - This is welded to the Rocker. So you can jack the
car up using the 914 factory jack.

These illustrated components are in ALL Automobile Atlanta 914 catalogs that
I have ever received. Each component that makes up the TOTAL, referred to as
longitudinal support by others, can be removed and then replaced by weldment.
Assess what you really need to repair, and you will see these pieces shown
clearly illustrated in the AA catalog.

George Hussey is called Dr.914 because he has dissected and done surgery on
more 914s than anyone in the WORLD through Automobile Atlanta restoration
projects. Use his descriptive information as the 914 standard nomenclature. 
 
Being confused is easy when working on a 914 or any other car. Many call the
same parts by different names.

I hope this has helped you.
