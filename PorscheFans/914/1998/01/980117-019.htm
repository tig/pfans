Greetings to all;
I've a member of this list for quite some time and have appreciated the =
advice and tech tips presented.
I have a number of specific questions that I hope some of can assist me =
with.
1.. Has anyone converted the spare tire driven windshield washer system =
over to electrical?  Any advice on how to do this?
    2.. Could anyone suggest a replacement method of taping up, covering =
or otherwise securing the wiring harness.  Hockey tape turns to goo =
after ~ 2 years from the gas fumes in the front trunk. This car is a =
serious concours / auto-x car and that melted gooey tape junk loves to =
attract all sorts of foreign matter (judges not impressed).  I've =
considered the plastic tubing used in domestic vehicles but it looks =
rather tacky.  Any ideas???
    3.. Is there a reasonably priced replacement for the under powered =
stock round fog lights, something say about 80 watts strong??
    4.. Lastly, some time ago on the list there was an article about a =
combo gauge that included oil temp, oil pressure and fuel all in one. =
Could some one with actual knowledge of this gauge please let me know as =
I'm definetly interested.
    I can be reached via email: murbanowski@bc.sympatico.ca

Thank you.
