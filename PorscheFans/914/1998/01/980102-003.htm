	The coil has a (+) terminal, a (-) terminal, and a BIG center
terminal.  Each of the two outer terminals has several places to stick
a connector.
	The (+) terminal should have the black wire on it.  This sup-
plies 12V whenever the ignition is on.  ("Switched power".)  The green
wire from the condensor (and from the points) goes to the (-) terminal.
The tachometer takes its inputs directly from the points, so its wire
(the black-with-purple-stripe) should also go on the (-) terminal.
The purple can get hard to see through the years (and the dirt), but
this wire is thinner than the (+)-side wire.
	The wire to the Aux Air Regulator is not supposed to be hooked
onto the coil--at least, not on a 2.0 engine.  The 1.7 may be different.
I don't know if it hurts anything to have this wire hooked up here.
The stock arrangement feeds the AAR from its own wire, that comes off
the FI wiring harness, usually down underneath the manifold.  The wire
actually goes to the same place in the relay board as the fuel pump
power, so that the AAR is energized whenever the pump runs...

	Good luck!  Let us know if moving the AAR wire does anything.
