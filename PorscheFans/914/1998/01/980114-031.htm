 Hi Brad!

  You asked 3 different questions; on the sticking in gear, I don't
know; I might venture to guess mis-aligned shift shafts and / or
forks, or possibly worn shift shafts or worn bores that the shift
shafts ride in.   Hopefully, you will get a more informed reply from
the list.

  I have done this job, although it was quite a while ago.   The
concern of the Haynes book writers (and the Porsche book says the
same thing) seems to be that the automatic adjustment widgets on the
insides of the pistons can be messed up with improper handling.   In
reality they seem to be relatively idiot-resistant, and unless one of
yours is fouled up, you should have no difficulties.   I did not try
to dissassemble the auto adjustment gadgets, and I don't think that
it would be a good idea to do so.  I think that that is what the
books are leery of.   Just clean things up well in solvent, flush
with brake fluid after, and re-assemble with new rubber parts.   

   Following is my original write-up on how I did mine; please note
that I included suggestions to a list member on how he could free up
frozen adjuster screws... if yours are capable of being turned
easily, omit the banging, and just turn the screws in the appropriate
direction to eject the pistons, as discussed.

Hi 914-er's!

  Jeff Brubaker asked about rebuilding 914 rear calipers, and Ken 
Korn posted a copy of my original posting on the subject.  Ken 
noticed that it had been somewhat garbled in transmission, and I 
agree, so I will re-post it in the hope that it will be a little
clearer.

  Also, let me address two additional concerns on the rear calipers:

  First, Chip writes:

"   I've heard from 914 friends that there is a square rubber 
bushing/gasket between the caliper halves, (unobtainium brand), 
which, if compromised, will render your caliper useless.   "

  I didn't find anything fitting that description when I split my
calipers.

(My car is a '74 2.0 litre, September '73 production.)  They have the

same pair of fluid channel O-rings that the front calipers do, and
that's 
it.  Assuming that you have new O-rings (come in the kit from GPR), 
and that you don't break any bolts, or drop the caliper halves so as
to 
mung up the mating surfaces,  you should have no difficulties.

  The second concern is that I have since discovered that a silicon 
(or some other non-petroleum based brake grease) is recommended 
as piston lubricant.  I used brake fluid, which is all that I ever
used in 
rebuilding other brakes, but the silicon sounds like a good idea if
not 
overdone.

  Following is my original rebuild description:

  Let's see...  it seems that I just went through this; let me see
what I  
can remember about it.  First, there's a pretty good write up on one
of 
the 914 web pages about the rear brakes; I'd suggest that you read it

and see if it gives you any ideas.
  Second, I ended up dismounting my calipers and working on them 
on  the bench; if your venting clearance screws are frozen, it will
be 
impossible to properly adjust the calipers for proper venting
clearance 
/ handbrake operation anyway, and a re-build is probably in order.
  So... assuming that you dismount your calipers, here's what I did
to 
free my adjustment screws.  First, you will have to purchase a good 
set of 3/8" drive metric allen wrenches, as I did.  These are 
necessary to drive the adjustment screws, especially the inside one 
when the caliper is re-mounted on the trailing arm, and also 
necessary for the free-up-the-screw trick. 
   As I recall, my adjustment screws were not frozen, but the
notorious 
cap over the inner one was.  My solution was to install the 4mm allen

on the end of a suitable extension, and deliver several sharp blows
to 
the end of the extension with a soft hammer.  The cap came right off 
with no protest.  A similar treatment will probably be sucessful for
your 
frozen outer adjuster.   (Please note that I refer here to the
adjuster itself, and not the outer adjuster dust cap, which is
plastic... if you hit that with a hammer, you will destroy it!)  The
inner adjuster is pretty well protected 
behind a cap, as I mentioned, and hopefully will not be frozen.  If
it is, 
you will have real problems.
  Please note that the outer adjustment screw is, as I recall,
devided 
into two right-hand threaded portions, a short outer one, and a long 
inner one, seperated by a shoulder on the screw which rides on the 
inside of the caliper.  Just outboard of this shoulder a groove is 
machined for a very tiny O-ring.  This seals the brake fluid inside
the 
caliper.  The outer threaded portion has a groove machined right into

the middle of the threaded portion to accept a circlip which holds
the 
adjuster in place when it is turned clockwise (direction to retract
the 
piston).  This circlip is visible right next to the caliper body as
soon as
the outer plastic dust cap is removed. 
  Please be sure to remove this circlip when attempting to break the 
screw free; otherwise you will mangle the circlip (as I did).
  Once you get it loose, turn it counter clockwise until the piston
falls 
out of the caliper.  Actually, the piston won't fall out; it will be 
necessary to unscrew the piston the last little bit from the
adjustment 
screw by turning it in it's bore until you can remove it.  Now, you
can 
turn the adjustment screw clockwise, and it will screw into the
caliper 
body and fall out the cylinder bore in the caliper.
  I cleaned up my pistons with fine emory paper to get the worst of
the 
corrosion rough spots off, and finished the job with jeweler's rouge
and 
a cloth buffing wheel on my bench grinder.  The pistons came out 
looking quite nice, and my calipers don't leak a drop.  
  Replace the piston seal, the tiny O-ring on the adjuster, and 
reassemble the outer half of the caliper, taking care to lubricate
with 
brake fluid (or silicon grease) as you go.  Don't forget to
re-install the circlip.
  The inner half adjuster I did not take apart, because it seemed
that 
the only way to do so was to remove the handbrake return spring, 
and I just didn't feel like fighting with it.  It is possible to
remove the
outer part of the adjuster quite easily once the dust plug is off, as
it is
simply a 4 mm allen screw with pinion gear teeth where the threads 
ought to be, and as such, falls right out of the caliper if you are
not 
careful. 
  NOTE:  because this screw is off center from the actual adjusting 
screw in the center of the caliper bore, and drives the adjuster 
through small gear teeth, it's rotation is BACKWARDS compared to 
the outer screw.  In other words, to get the piston out of the bore, 
turn the inside adjuster CLOCKWISE; to retract the piston into the 
caliper, turn the adjuster COUNTER-clockwise.
  As with the outer piston, you will probably have to rotate the
piston 
itself (counterclockwise looking into the caliper bore) to finish 
detaching it from it's adjuster.
  Clean up the piston, install a new seal, lubricate, and re-install
it in 
the caliper.  Once it contacts the adjuster, turn the adjuster screw 
counter clockwise to retract the piston into the bore.  I lubricated
my 
inner adjusters with silicone grease to protect any exposed rubber 
inside; I don't know if this type grease is necessary, or if any old 
grease will do, but I wouldn't put it together dry.
  Don't forget to install the dust boots around the pistons;  I had
to 
crop the dust boot retaining rings that came with my rebuild kit as 
they were too long and the ends tried to overlap when installed.
  Re-assemble the caliper with new O-rings (they go in the machined 
recesses around the passages between the caliper halves), and 
torque the caliper through bolts using the same two-step process and
tightening order as shown for the front calipers on page 113 of the
Haynes book.  The finish torque is 16 ft*lbs.
   Re-install the caliper.  Adjust as per the Haynes manual.  Bleed
the 
system and you are all set.
  By the way, I grew up fixing Triumphs and MG's; what I and the 
British call a circlip, you American chaps call a C-ring; I don't
have 
the slightest idea what the Germans call it.

                                        Good Luck,
                                        Jim T.


   That's all I know about rear calipers....

   Check the gaskets / heat insulators between the manifolds and the
heads... check the manifold-to-head fasteners for correct torque. 
Other than this, I have no other ideas; let's hope the list has some
additional suggestions.
