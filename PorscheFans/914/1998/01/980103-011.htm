Another factor to consider is that mufflers disperse the backwave by
reducing the "Q" of the resonance. You'd have to know the dampening factor
of the muffler to calculate it, I think. Also, every curve of the tube
introduces resistance, which also reduces "Q". I think a straight pipe with
no bends and no muffler and a megaphone at the end would have maximum "Q",
which would have the effect of a very high backwave pulse over a very short
frequency range. The effect of mufflers and bends would be to broaden the
frequency range and reduce the peak considerably. The latter is good for
street driving, the former for racing.
