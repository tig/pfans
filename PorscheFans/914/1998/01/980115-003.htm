As far as the sticking goes, I would check the condition of the shift
linkage.  Are the two set screws firmly in place?  I had one loosen up, and
found that I couldn't get the car out of fourth gear.  After enough prying
and pulling, it finally came out of fourth, but the shift linkage also came
off the car and fell to the side of the highway, leaving me stranded.  While
you're under there, check the conditions of the bushings as well.  As far as
the "bug motor" noise goes, I've experienced something similar three times.
First, my exhaust was loose at the heads.  It sounds like you've got this
covered.  Second, the air injectors for my smog pump were loose (which, with
a '70 1.8, I don't think you need to worry about).  Third, the connection to
my trigger points was loose, causing two of the cylinders to misfire.  I'm
not too familiar with the L-jet, so I don't know if this could be your
problem, but, if you have a condition where you're just blowing air/fuel out
the exhaust, you'll get a nice "bug" sound.

Hope this helps a little!
