I just thought I'd throw in a couple of comments on the thread regarding
stainless steel valves and whatnot.  I've just had my wisdom teeth extracted
(can you believe that I actually had to save up several hundred dollars and
forgo 914 parts so that some lunatic could yank four teeth out of my
head?!), so if this message rambles on and makes no sense, forgive me.
When MSHP told me that I would be better off using stainless steel exhaust
valves (rather than the stock sodium-filled ones) in my rebuilt heads, I was
quite a bit skeptical.  The consensus seems to be that sodium-filled valves
are far superior to their solid counterparts.  In a round-about way, this is
how the guy (I think his name was Bill) explained it to me:  The reason that
Porsche used sodium filled valves in the first place wasn't because they
were superior to solid valves, but because there was an inherent design flaw
with the type 4 heads that required a "fix".  I think the flaw had something
to do with the shoddy valve seats (which many list members can attest to).
His (Bill's) rational was that the combination of the new valve seats and
the Stellite (sp?) valve guides with the stainless steal valves worked out
better than the stock valve seats, stock valve guides, and stock sodium
filled valves.  For whatever reason, this made sense to me.  I cannot recall
why he said that the sodium filled valves didn't work well with the new
valve guides and seats, but I'm sure there was a reason.  The biggest reason
that I decided to go with the stainless steel valves in my rebuilt heads was
this:  MSHP had absolutely nothing to gain by misinforming me about the
sodium-filled valves, and if anything, only stood to loose out if they were
wrong.  I got to keep my sodium filled valves, so they didn't get to turn
around and sell them as someone else suggested.  Also, they warranty the
heads for 5 years or 100,000 miles, regardless of what they're used for
(racing, street, etc).  If the heads were more likely to fail with stainless
steel valves, wouldn't MSHP advocate using the sodium-filled valves?  I know
everyone's opinions on this topic varies, but these are just the reasons
that I decided to listen to them.

Hope this helps,
