Keep posting any plans.  I use to live in Salinas before moving down to
Pasadena so I'll be up there staying with my sister. I'd like to meet up
with anyone convoying  from Monterey or Salinas to Laguna Seca.

My current goal is to get my 914 roadworthy enough to drive up there.
Definitely won't get the whole project finished so it will still be the
lovely P.O. fushcia color ;-p   Worst  case I might make a tow bar and tow
it up so I could at least drive it from Salinas to the racetrack.

For anyone driving up I'd suggest looking at a map of the area from LA up
to there.  There are a lot of cool twisty roads in the area between I5 and
Hwy101 going up there.  I really want to try some with the 914.

I think all the 914 Owners should get together in Monterey and show the
rest of the porsche world how great our " Square Cars " look.  If we
plan early we can get a hotel in the middle of Monterey.  Nothing would
be better than a convoy of 914's heading out to Laguna Seca every
morning.  If you are interested  E-Mail me .  If I get enough people
interested I will try to set up a special Hotel rate in Monterey.
