You asked "Also-  anyone advise on Bursch exhausts?  Look mighty
usefully cheap 
compared to 912E OE (which is frighteningly 'caro')." 

My experience is limited to fitting to a 914, but for what it's worth
the exhaust was excellent. Previous experience was with "performance"
exhausts for Beetles which rarely fitted properly first time and took
forever to sort. The Bursch I fitted to my 2:0 litre was some weight (my
wallet felt it having had it shipped from the US to the UK) I used a
trolley jack to raise it to the correct height and was stunned to be
able to line it up and bolt it home first time. It fitted as if it were
a factory unit.

Noise was excellent with a deeper tone, performance was hard to judge as
I was also fitting twin 40's (apologies to the injection purists, but I
didn't know about this list in those days o.k. and I had serious
problems!), but it appeared slightly better than stock. Can't comment on
longevity as I sold the car, but I have seen it since and that exhaust
still looks good. (3years on).

Hope this helps.
