Those Pauter rockers sound nice.

Someone mentioned the other day about using the "elephant-foot" valve
adjustment screws from a 911 on the 914 rocker arms.  The problem was they
wouldn't fit the different larger ones on the 2.0L heads.  I've used the
Berg elephant foot screws on my Thing and really like them.

Has anyone done this or is it even possible, switch the rocker shafts from
a 1.7L motor to the 2.0L heads so you can use the 911 screws?

Pauter Machine out on the left coast sells a really nice needle bearing,
roller tipped, aluminum rocker arm set for about 350$. I'm sorely tempted
to whip the 'ole VISA out and say "gimme!"
Basically, rockers are too heavy and there is too much friction in them.
Reducing valvetrian inertia is a time honored way to increase mechanical
effeciency. The stock rockers in my bmws are aluminum and they are very
light. The stock 914 rockers must be over twice/three times as heavy.
