> What welder would you buy to begin with.

Lincoln make an excellent arc/mig welder in both a 110V and 220V series.
The cost is less then $300.  Without the Argon/CO2 tank (the attachments
is another ~$100), they have a core welding spool that can be used
without the tank attachments - and will do a great job for most  body
work.  My experience with traditional arc and oxyacetylene is that is
difficult to  get the temps/volts low enough to create a tack or run a
seam without burning holes in the sheet metal.  With the Lincoln 110V
model, I use the lowest power setting with a wire feed of about 2.5 for
20 & 22 gauge steel (most body panels).  Plus, a good MIG will last for
years and helps even the most un-practiced novice create good welds (I
should know - the 914 is my 5th P'car restoration :-)

One last thought - PRACTICE helps a lot. Practice tacks and seams on a
22 gauge sheet (~$10 for a 2'x3' sheet) before going to  work on your
car.  The sheets are cheaper blowing holes through factory sheet metal
replacements.  Also, take your time to prepare the surfaces properly -
the extra prep time will show in the final product ..

Happy New year to one and all. Hopefully all of us in various parts of the
country, nee, the world, will get at least a couple sunny top down days this
winter. Crank up the heat exchangers,put on the  leather gloves and jacket and
take the ole roadster out and drive!

Some of you may get the Pfans general list, where an interesting point came
up. Seats. I have the better pair of two 914's and even though they're not
perfect nor too awfully bad, I have furry fake black sheepskin covers. My
"good" seat is the famous 75 green plaid--dirty w/rips and all. I noticed a
seat by SCAT called a PRO-90 in a HOT VW buggy and the highback versions looks
like it will fit in a 914 nicely with the stock backpad in place. Even at
5'10", I keep my seat a couple notches forward of the rearmost setting, so
losing a bit of room would probably be ok in my situation. This seat might be
too high off the floor, though. But a pair of these new would be less moolah
than it would be for my local upholsterer to redo my current seats. Plus, I
could get one at a time as money permits. I am not into stock concours as my
914 is a daily driver and is basically stock anyway.  Does anyone out there
have "other than stock seat"? Suggestions? Opinions?
(I don't believe I have to ask anyone for opinions!)

I want to thank John Dunkly for the post on Longitudinal repair. 
Question: To fix a sagging passenger side at the jack point caused by rust
(since contained-  Thanx EXTEND) around the firewall, do I need a whole
"clamshell" like AA sells, or can I just re do the inner rocker? Slight
jacking with a floor jack right under where the passenger side jack hole lines
up the "sagging" just about perfectly. I would rather spend $85 bucks and get
my welding buddy to help and fix just the passenger side inner than add all
the weight and hassle and money with the clamshells on both sides.

Dave,
Thanks for the tips on 1.8 mod's. My engine appears to have 160 k miles on it,
and it still goes. I've got a leaky oil cooler (seals) and leaks at the
pushrod tubes. It seems to have ok compression and doesn't burn oil. It holds
a valve adjust well and for quite a few mile, though I've always adjusted them
and changed oil every 3k. I have a pertronix in their and bump up the timing a
hair and that seems to help a bit. I know understand the L-jet pretty good and
can ussually troubleshoot anything that goes wrong. Manifold pressure is very
good. 
I've recently slipped a disk in my neck, and that means hiring a mechanic to
help me with the leaks. I'm bringing the car by tonite so that he can check it
out Monday am and then we'll decide the best course of action. This guy works
exclusively on Type IV's--buses mostly. He came recommended by two other 914
owners and one bus owner I know. We'll see what he says.
     Last week I called around looking for engine cores to swap in there.
Here's what I found locally:
1. Used rebuilt 914 1.8 w/ carbs. Sounds really good. The guy crunched the
front end real bad and will pull and sell the engine for $300 minus carbs.
Leaks at pushrods on one side, but not at cooler or filter. 
2. Junkyard used 1.8 from bus. $450. 
3. Junkyard used 2.0 from bus. Guy claims it has big heads. Are these probably
VW bus wy hyd lifters? Will this work with the L-jet?
I want to keep the L-jet cuz I can work on it and spent some $ getting it set
right, but I wonder if any of these other blocks would give any more hp.
Anyone know anything about Type IV engines--bus, not 914. My budget pretty
much rules out 914 2.0's. Anybody got HP stats for these?
