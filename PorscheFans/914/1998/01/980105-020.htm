Horizontal fans for sixes do exist. But they are VERY VERY expensive.
How much does your motor cost? 2, maybe $3k? Then spend $10k on a
horizontal fan kit from porsche motorsport? Ouch. 

Give some very serious consideration to the engineering needed for a
mechanical horizontal fan. You need something that can handle 10,000
rpm. That way the occasional 7,000 rpm that you actually achieve will
not be a concern.

That's what I like about them, you can have them hooked up into a
feedback circuit with head a head temp sensor, and can regulate the
cooling very accurately. And it won't sap as much power from the crank
as a mechanical fan will. Remember, gears are not 100% efficient, and
that means heat, so every gear you go through will need to be oil fed.
And you _will_ loose power through it as well.

I don't think so actually. An electric fan can just be bolted right in,
and wired up. And would most definately be alot cheaper than fabricating
a gear driven fan assembly. 

But don't get me wrong, I think the flat gear driven fan is as sexy as
anything out there. But it was concieved of with very very powerful
turbo motors in mind. When you're pumping out 400+hp (or as much as
1khp), sacrificing a few ponies for the fan doesn't seem like as much of
an ordeal as when you're scraping the bucket for maybe 120hp.

> Any ideas?

Go electric. The only problem I have with electric is there would be a
need for a failsafe mode in case the motor failed somehow. The belt
driven fan of the 911 has a failsafe warning, the alternator light comes
on when the belt goes. Something similar would be a good idea, if the
fan goes and you don't know it, the next sound you hear might be a very
expensive one.

If you have a fan that delivers too much air, then you can baffle it. Or
just turn down the voltage if it's electric. The problem always seems to
be not enough air rather than too much. I'd rather have a fan that
delivers too much air and engineer some way to regulate it, than to have
to suffer with insufficient airflow.
