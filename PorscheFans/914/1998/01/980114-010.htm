Oh NO! I wrinkled P-car, that's a sad thing. Best wishes on a speedy
repair.

In my opinion (and that's all it is), the Bursch is superior to the OE in
all respects save two. First: it's not original, and that's a concern for
some. And second: it's gonna be a bit louder, that too is a concern for
some. But the performance is great, and durrability seems to be on par
with the OE stuff. Although I don't think anyone out there has a 20 year
old Bursch yet, and my OE muffler is still in reasonably good working
order. I have a Brusch on the car, but the OE is being stored for now. I
don't think an OE 914 2.0L muffler is the same as a 912 OE muffler, but I
could be wrong. Been wrong before, will be wrong again...

Hey, we share the same engine, and the same heritage, and the same
prejudices (NARP syndrome). So don't feel like you don;t belong here,
'cause you do.
