I'm definately in the BTDT group.  Couple of comments.

1st:  The number I have for Parts Werks is 800-366-9147 or 815-462-3000
They're in Chicago.

Mine had the rust you describe (and a pristine trunk)  I thought that
all
I needed was a new battery tray.  So I got one of those, and tried to
fit
it in.  Finally figured out that I needed a new engine shelf.  When I
tried
to fit THAT in, I found that the inner fender had rotted away.  By the
time
I had cleared out all the rusted pieces, I needed a small section of
firewall,
the top of the longitudinal support, new upper inner fender, new engine
shelf,
and the batterey tray.  For me, adding the stiffening panels didn't add
that
much to the job.  Of course, once I was in there, ship-wrights disease
set in,
and the trunk mounts got changed, the engine lid hinges were replaced,
the rear
sway bar mounts were beefed up, etc., etc.

But back to your project.  I don't think your firewall rust comes from a
leaky
rear window.  That's just not how these cars rust.  More than likely,
the holes
are from where the engine shelf _used_ to be.

What you need to do is find a good example of a car, and look closely at
it.

It there anyone in the Seattle area that will let Nick sniff around at
their
car?


Gary.

PS:  What you really need to do is decide how long you want to keep the
car.
Your repair idea will probably work, but for how long?  Purists will
hate it,
but heck, it's not that rare of a car.

PPS:  My rust repair cost more than the purchase price.
