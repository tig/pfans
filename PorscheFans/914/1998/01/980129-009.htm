Hi Demick,

Here is a post of the fog light conversion I saved from some time ago.
Don't know who originally posted it.

914 FOG LIGHT CONVERSION 1970-1974

Many of us 914 owners have wished our U.S. fog lights worked all of the
time and not just with the
low beams. Well it's not as hard as you think! You will need only basic
hand tools and a few assorted
solderless connectors.

First: Disconnect the negative side of the battery.

Second: Remove the fuse cover, remove the mounting screws and pull down the
 fuse block and let it
hang.

Third: Remove the headlamp, fog and hazard switches from their dash mounted
 locations and let them
hang down with the fuse block.

Fourth: Take the headlamp switch and look for a black wire w/blue stripe
that is plugged into the #56
terminal, there will also be a grey wire and a red wire w/white stripe all
connected together, carefully
cut the black wire w/blue stripe as close to the end as possible leaving no
 part of the wire exposed.
Install a piggy-back spade connector.

Fifth: Locate the #15 terminal on the headlamp switch and pull remove the
connector then plug in the
black wire w/blue stripe and then piggyback the connector that was just
there.

Sixth: Now find the white wire w/blue stripe going to the #1 fuse, this
wire is coming from the #85
terminal of the fog light relay (round black relay, far left on fuse
block). Be certain you have selected
the correct wire (white wire w/blue stripe) you are about to cut at the #1
fuse (just as you did before),
cut it and find a solderless connector to fit the ground connection located
 at the upper left side of the
fuse block mount. You will see a group of brown wires held down by a 13mm
nut. Remove the nut
and add the white wire w/blue stripe. You may need to add a 2 to 3 inch
piece of wire so it will reach
the ground connection. Be sure to tighten this ground connection.

Seventh: Reinstall the three switches and fuse block in reverse order
making sure not to pinch any
wires when tightening up the fuse block. Now connect the negative battery
cable to the battery.

Eight: To test--turn the ignition switch to the "ON" position and turn on
the fog lights. You may now
enjoy your fog lights any time the ignition is on.

-stuff deleted-
This brings up a question of mine.  As far as the fog lights go, the wiring
is
a bit confusing. I know that the fog lights are tied to the headlight
operation
and I believe that they may be tied to the high/low beam state also.  Do
the
fogs go off/on depending on whether the headlights are on high or low beam
(assuming the fog light switch is turned on of course).  Will the fogs turn
on
when only the parking lights are on without the headlights?  If someone can
fill me in it would help me understand the wiring.
Thanks!
