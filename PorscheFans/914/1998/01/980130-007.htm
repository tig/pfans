Rob,
In a test done on Timken Bearings for lubricity using 279,506 PSI these
figures below show that Pro_Long is good, but not the best of those tested.

Product Dyne Lube has a friction temp of 161.4 and metal scar of .085
Product Pro-Long has a friction temp of 179.6 and metal scar of .105
Which means Dyna Lube is cooler running and doesn't wear metal as much.

It is noted that ALL were described as ADDITIVES. Anti friction additives.

When I don't know the answer, I use my fingers and search the web for what I
want to know. Try your browser search feature sometimes. It works.

Take a cruize to http://www.dynalife.com/testresults.htm to read the
complete testing methods and all the results of ALL additives tested.

Don't take my word for it, after all we are just a bunch of idiots who use
this list per your post. x:-) x = the unknown facts.
