I'm looking at a '75 2.0 with a valve guide that has come loose.  The
seller has explained that the heads have not been rebuilt in awhile, so I
would like to just have the heads rebuilt.  My questions is, what all work
would you recommend when rebuilding the heads?

Here is what I have come up with so far:
     new valve guides (bore, seat, and ream)
     new valves (the current ones have endured one rebuild already, no
sense pushing it)
     new valve springs
     new pushrod tube seals (any other seals?)
     valve cover gaskets (any other gaskets?)
The seller tells me that the valve seats are great, there are no cracks in
the heads, and the rocker assemblies are fine.  I mentioned possibly
flycutting the head and he says that he doesn't see a need.  In fact, the
only other thing he recommends attending to is to have the air injection
holes welded up (he plugged the ends but does not think the threads will
last through another removal).

The car is currently carbed, although all the original FI pieces will come
with the car so it can be converted back if I want.

So what else should I have attended to or inspected while I'm in there?

TIA.
