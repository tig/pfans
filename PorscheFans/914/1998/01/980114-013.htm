Hey John, 
It happens to all of us, every now and again a post just dosent jump out
at anybody to answer and its gone.
Look at all the crap I post, some go unnoticed, but all in all, I love
this list even if a few get by.
Example. last week I posted a note to the 914 and 911 list about I
wonder how much more are pre '73 cars are now worth since SB42...that
post when out to about 2K people and it did spare one bit on interest.
Dosnt matter really either way, I dont plan to sell or buy soon...just
wondering aload.

Don

On January 13th, the Company is hosting our web site had it's IP Address
changed in accordance with many computer / telephone system changes
that are occuring in Seattle right now.  As an unfortunate result, the
robustness
of our web site, www.pelicanparts.com, seems to have taken a nosedive.

Needless to say, I am not happy about this, and I am attempting to get some
answers from people who may be able to help.  Being located 2500 miles away
doesn't help.

I ask for your patience, and that you keep trying our site.  I will re-email
this
notice out again when the switch to the new IP address is complete, and there
are no more problems.

Thank you for your patience.

-Wayne
