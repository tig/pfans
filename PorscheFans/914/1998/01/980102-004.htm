	I hope everyone had a good Holiday!  My "day off" gave me a chance
to swap in the new relay board that Cory was kind enough to let me borrow,
and as I suspected, it didn't make a difference.  I did notice, however,
that the PO had scraped off about half of the coating on the bottom of mine,
and had soldered up a few of the connections.  How critical is it that I
"replace" the missing coating?  Should I go through the process of scraping
the rest off and soldering it up, or should I leave it alone for now?
	I've realized that there really is only one remaining component of
my fuel injection that has not been replaced, repaired, or swapped.  The
fuel injectors.  Since I've heard of several people having problems with
theirs that could not be detected through flow testing, I've resolved myself
to saving up the cash and buying four new ones.  Has anyone ever purchased
the rebuilt units from Automotion?  If they're good rebuilds, then I'll
probably take that route since they're half the price of new ones.

Thanks again,

J.J. Slowik
