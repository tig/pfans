TWO YEARS AGO I BOUGT A 1971 PORSCHE 914. IT WAS THE FIRST 914 I EVER
BUY. WELL THE LICENSE REGISTRATION OF THE CAR SAYS :  VW 71
                                   IT DOES'NT SAYS : POR 71
IS THAT OK ?
THE CAR IS A 914/4 (4 CYLINDER 1.7 TYPE IV VOLKSWAGEN ENGINE) IS THAT
THE CASE WHY THE REGISTRATION SAYS : VW 71
IF ANY ONE HAVE HEARD OF THIS BEFORE ?

i was noticing that after my 2 litre has suuficient time to warm up it idles
low, almost like its on the verge of stalling.  i know that the comnputer
controls the idle, and i have stupidly been messing with the knob, not really
knowing exactly what the real problem is.  i know that if the engine runs to
lean, that it will burn up.  so right now it is turned up all the way.  but im
not sure if that is good or not.  what is the best way to go about this little
computer problem?

Thanks
