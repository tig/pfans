AA's fact sheet on rebuilding these calipers says the adjuster will come
right out after removing the c-clip from inside the cylinder.  There is
no mention of removing the brake lever.  This AA fact sheet could be a
lot clearer, but I think I've interpreted it correctly.  Am I missing
something or is there a need to remove this brake lever?

This list is great.  It appears that a number of us are rebuilding the
rear calipers at the same time.

Does anyone have any tricks for getting the caliper halves apart?  I've
broken 4 T27 head trying to get the inner bolts off.  I've applied
liquid wrench over several days and even tried heat.

 The lever and associated pivot shaft are somehow retained by something
 inside the caliper. They don't just come off after the spring is
removed.
 Not having a diagram of the internal construction and not seeing
anything
 obvious (like a snap ring) anywhere, I'm stuck. I hope George Hussey
has an
 answer, something besides the usual "don't take it apart" thing I
always
 hear from people. Hell, I've been taking stuff apart since I was a
little
 kid. It's in my bones damnit! I usually get stuff back together too!

You have to take out the round plate at the top of that piece of the
caliper.
Under the plate is a snap ring that, when removed, will allow you to
remove
the lever and shaft.  You get the round plate out by drilling thru it
and
prying it out.  I resealed mine by brazing the hole back up before
putting the
plate back in.
