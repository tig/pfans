Adding my .02 cents (without any heat) for the would-be painter:
Keeping The Dirt Away
	Most dirt in the paint film comes from static electricity.  (This is also
magic.)  The car sits on four tires (or more or less) that are really good
insulators.
	The more you sand the car, the more electricity it builds up.  It's like
when you dragged you feet across the carpet and then zapped the cat or your
sister, whoever was closest.  (This electric shock treatment was called
"nuking the cat" when I was little.  We had a great wool carpet.  In tennis
shoes, with enough scuffing, I could get pretty near a 2-inch arc.)
	Wet sanding tends to keep the static away.  Dry sanding makes it worse;
and tends to throw silicone particles all over that can cause fisheye
later.  Wet sand.  One sheet of wet sandpaper living in a bucket of water
will outwear twenty sheets of dry paper, costs less, and works better.
	Another way to reduce the dust problem is to ground the car and the
compressor.  Any kind of wire connected from the frame of the car, and the
air tank on the compressor, to a water pipe or electrical conduit takes the
static right out.  A metal stake driven into the ground 18" with salt water
poured around it works if you're out in the "shady tree garage."  I prefer
TV antenna wire, because it can be taped down flat on the floor, and I
don't get my big feet tangled up while I'm working my way around the car. 
	Smaller items can be sprayed while sitting on aluminum foil that has been
grounded—like that anti-static mat under a computer.
	A paint job done in a dirt floor garage can look as good as one performed
in professional spray booths—as long as you get rid of the static.  So now
you can use enamel or whatever you want.
	DO NOT WET the floor. Evaporating water contaminates the hardener Looks
like glass dust all over the car.
