I'm SO glad I found a great engine builder to assemble my 2.5 four!  He
caught three potentially fatal problems with the parts included in the
"Monster Kit":
1. The connecting rod bearings' outer edge radii are smaller than the
mating radii of the stroker crank journals.  As a result, the bearings
ride on their two outer edges unless they are machined with a larger
radius so they can sit down in the journal properly.
2. The piston-to-cylinder clearance was only .0015"; my builder has seen
piston growth from heat seize engines with clearances this small, so he
took mine out to .003" (he runs .004-.005" in his own race engine, but
also rebuilds it more frequently than I intend to).
3. The piston rings needed gapping.  As delivered, they overlapped.

European Racing (the supplier of the parts) responded: 1. "We've never
had a problem with that." 2. "We run them with .0015-.002" all the
time." and 3. "Some assembly required."  (all quotes approximate).
Seriously, though, if they don't believe there is a problem, how can
they avoid the problem during assembly?

My builder was Jerry at NorthWest Connecting Rod (Seattle, WA).  The
downside of working with Jerry: He's as anti-electronic-commerce as the
Unibomber - no Website, no email, no fax, no credit cards - and his
quality reputation (a kind of popularity) results in almost constant
interruptions from the phone and "drop-ins."  The upside is that he
knows air cooled engines inside out, he's a racer himself with a lot of
experience, he assumes nothing (measures everything), and lets the
customer decide after providing all the facts and likely outcomes.  His
only requirement is that if you pick stuff that's outside what he thinks
is right, you don't tell anybody he built the engine ". . . but if you
want a grenade, I'll build you one!"  There was only one snafu which
resulted from a conversation on cam choice; I'd planned on using the
WebCam 86a (.435" x 290 degrees), but a WebCam 163 (.500" x 284 degrees)
was ordered and installed - the difference is that the one he picked
makes about 5 more hp according to the DeskTop Dyno software, and I
guess I'll just have to live with that. ;-)

You'd be blessed if you can find a similar professional in your own
locale.  NWCR is listed in the 206 area code directory, but to keep his
work moving along, please don't just call to chat or get advice.  His
customers thank you.

This is titled "(part 1 - assembly)" because I'm just now installing the
engine (and the garage is COLD so it will take a while).  After I break
it in, I'll post "(part 2 - living with a big four)."
