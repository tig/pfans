Thanks. I asked for it. Your input has made up my mind. I will go for the
Antique. Sensible, low annual fee and the tooting (beep beep) that 914 is
viable, sharp and many other adjectives indicating proud to own since the
1st were released to our world in 1969.

Can you image, at the track for some of you, putting the others in your dust
and expending exhaust, with a statement stamped boldly, Antique, if
permitted to wear that tag in your state, region or country.

Of course mine will qualify. I have not been able to venture more than a
trip around the block since it needs, well, you name it. It does not smoke
as much as I do, so it will qualify under emmissions. Time, and I have
plenty of that (retired), will be needed to achieve a worthy roadster, as
funds trickel permit.

-----Snip if needed- below does not relate to Antique plates----------

I wish to express gratitude to Dan Freedman for the throttle body comment.
Thought you would be pleased Dan. My heart went into every moment as I did
what needed to be done to it. You and very few others have a big thank you
from me.
Thanks to: Ralph Ricks for the encouragement that gave me that potential and
the others which allowed me to use it. Mike Willis for the throttle bodies
for my back up. Tim Jones for the space to permit it. Don Rickles for
harmless humor.

Mike Cooley, formally the Southern Knight machinist.
Southern Knight meant, "fighting high cost of repairs".
