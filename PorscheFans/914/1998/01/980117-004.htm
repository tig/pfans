Thanks Randy, I'll keep that in mind. Hey, I just thought of soemthing. I
could sell my good 914 2.0 motor to finance a corvair conversion....hmmm,
something to thing about!! Let's see, the cyinders are excellent, with the
scratch marks still showing and no lip whatsoever. CR is the regular 7.6:1.
The heads need guides. The case is clean. I have new zinc plated pushrod
tubes and extra parts too. hmmm, this could be worth something.

I can see the cooling tin needs to be modified to use the alum. covers I

have - what do you with them do, cut a hole in the tin for clearance, or

pound it into a different shape?  TIA,

I haven't seen any aluminum valve covers first hand in several years.  I
purchased a set aprox. 15 years ago.  These were advertised as "no leak"
covers, and required unbolting two ends of the rocker shafts and installing a
nut/stud.  They did require some "massaging" of the sheetmetal.  They looked
great and worked poorly.  "No leak" was a bogus claim for these.  I've since
seen some advertised with O rings instead of gaskets and I would like to know
if these are any better.  The bolt holes are off center (top to bottom)
because of how they attatch to the rocker shafts, so I wonder if you could
ever get equal pressure on the gasket or O ring.  After more valve adjustments
than I can remember, I've got pretty good at putting on the valve covers, and
this is much less trouble than fooling with the bolt ons.  I purchased the
alum. ones to trick up my engine, but took them off when they leaked.  Oh yea,
I forgot that there wasn't a very good method for sealing the bolt holes
either.
