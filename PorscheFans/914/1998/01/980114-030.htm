     I have been lurking on this list for several months now and have found 
the information to be invaluable in keeping my daily driver '70 on the road. 
 My car has been relatively trouble free in my 6 months of ownership, but a 
few things have come up recently that I need a little help with.
1)   The car will occasionally stick in first gear.  There have been times 
that I have had to pull over and fight it out of gear.  Once I break it 
free, it will slide in and out with no problem.  I adjust the clutch cable 
freeplay once a month, so I don't think that is the problem.  The PO rebuilt 
the 901 with all new synchros 3 years ago.  Is this a synchro or shift 
mechanism problem?  Other?
2)   I have been amassing brake parts paycheck by paycheck (nothing like 
being a poor college student), and am about ready to do the job.  I read in 
Haynes that "rebuilding the rear calipers is not reccomended."  I have 
purchased the rebuild kits and it doesn't seem that hard.  Anyone done this 
and have any suggestions or comments?  I have rebuilt calipers before 
(previously owned MGBs), so I am not a total novice.
3)  My motor has a wierd noise.  I don't know how to describe it in words, 
but here goes.  It is coming from the driver's side and only under part 
throttle in any gear.  If I am really easy with it or mash the gas it goes 
away.  It is loudest in the 2000-3500rpm range.  The best way to describe 
the sound is like that of a poorly tuned Bug motor, like the valves are way 
out of adjustment or has a major vaccuum leak.  I have adjusted the valves, 
rebuilt and regasketed the carbs (Dellorto 36's), and tightened all the 
exhaust nuts.  None of the valve springs are broken, but could one or more 
be weak?  I don't know where to look next.
        Thanks in advance for the help.  I am in digest mode, so it might 
take me awhile to respond.

Thanks,

Brad Hescock
