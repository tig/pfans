Don:

If you read Stan's own description of the process he went through to
come up with his combo gauge, you'll see that his first idea was a
904 combo gauge -- hardly stock-looking -- and that building his own
combo gauge out of parts he bought at the swap meet was, in his 
words, "the least desirable option".

I think the eventual result of his experimentation is pretty good...
My only issue with it is the crooked silkscreening on the temperature
and pressure gauges.  In the 911 combo gauge from which those pieces
were scavenged, they're mounted at 3:00 and 9:00, so the numbers are
level; in Stan's gauge, they're mounted at 2:00 and 10:00, so the
numbers all lean inward.

To me, that looks as cheesy as the tachometers that the boy-racers
have rotated so as to put the redline at 12:00.  If they'd just
spend a few bucks to get the gauge faces re-silkscreened, they'd
look fine... But they don't, so the gauges look unbelievably
amateurish.

I wish I could show you a picture of my gauges... I think you'd see 
that they look VERY "stock".  If I can borrow a digital camera 
from someone, I'll put some pictures up on my web page.
