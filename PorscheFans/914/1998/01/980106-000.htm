Hi everyone,

Happy New Year!  I seem to have missed the valve-train thread due to digest
problems


Status report:  my 73 has a worn engine, so I'm building a 2.0 from several
cores, re-using pistons, cylinders, etc, but putting in new bearings, rings,
etc.  I happened to be able to save one pair of heads--no cracks!!  I've put
in new guides but re-grinding the valves.  I am in the process of polishing
the exhaust ports, with a semi-competition valve job (3 angle seats, 2 angle
valves, 0.080" wide exhaust seats, 0.060 intake yada yada).  When the engine
is built, I will do the swap and tear down the existing 2.0 engine for a
future rebuild.

The engine will be balanced and blue-printed, and running d-jet.  I've
gotten to the point where I now need to choose a cam.  The old one was *way*
too worn to use.  Any suggestions?  I'm leaning towards the FAT FI cam to
run with my d-jet.  Is it possible to run anything stronger than that, and
still retain the FI?

I'm also going to need lifters, new HD valve springs, etc.  Any advantages
with aftermarket pushrods, rockers, adjusting screws, etc?  I'm told that
911 swivel-foot-adjusters are the way to go, but don't fit in 2.0 rocker
arms.  What about retrofitting rockers from a 1.7, and running the 911
screws?

Can 2L rods be lightened?  What else do I need to do to make more power?
e.c. magazine says to put in ARP bolts, but I can't find a listing for 2.0
rods...are they the same bolts as the 1.7/1.8?

Do headers *really* make that much power?  I don't want to lose my heat, can
a heater box be built around the KH headers?

Thanks in advance.

cheers, Brian Ng
