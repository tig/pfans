OK, I may get cruxified for suggesting this, but has anyone ever put a
Corvair flat six into a 914?? They make good horsepower, there was a turbo
motor, and the parts are really cheap. How cheap?? Let me digress...How
about a set of 6 TRW cast pistons for 200$, forged for 300$?? I mean, BMW
pistons are at least 100$ EACH, and we all know what the stock VW Type IV
P&C's go for (about 500$??). Let's not even consider 911 motor parts
prices...Or hydraulic lifter set for 45$??...Alternator (rebuilt) for 85$?..
Anyway, it's an interesting motor, runs backwards, so a different cam would
be required to make it turn the other way (about 115$ for the cam, new). I
dont' know how much it weighs, but it is made of aluminum (iron cylinders I
think). Also, the Corvair people don't seem to replace the cylinders when
they do a rebuild like the VW crowd. They just bore them out to the next
larger size. It must work for them or they wouldn't do it. A good Corvair
140hp motor is cheap, probably about 500$ for a nice one. Of course, custom
sheetmetal would be required. 

I should have bought a Corvair instead of my 2002. Oh well, to late now....
