I agree with Mike on everything except for one thing... the exhaust nut
torque should be 15 ft. lb., at least that what I recall reading for my 2.0.
I do know that over tightening these will quickly pull the studs out, and I
also know that I've got mine torqued to 14 ft. lb. right now and they're not
leaking.
