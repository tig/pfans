How Specifications Live Forever

The US Standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet,
8.5
inches. That's an exceedingly odd number. 

Why was that gauge used? Because that's the way they built them in
England, and English expatriates built the US railroads. 

Why did the English people build them like that? Because the first rail
lines were built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways,
and that's the gauge they used. 

Why did "they" use that gauge then? Because the people who built the
tramways used the same jigs and tools that they used for building
wagons, which used that wheel spacing. Okay! 

Why did the wagons use that odd wheel spacing? Well, if they tried to
use any other spacing the wagons would break on some of the old, long
distance roads, because that's the spacing of the old wheel ruts. 

So who built these old rutted roads? The first long distance roads in
Europe
were built by Imperial Rome for the benefit of their legions. The roads
have been used ever since. 

And the ruts? The initial ruts, which everyone else had to match for
fear of destroying their wagons, were first made by Roman war chariots.
Since the chariots were made for or by Imperial Rome they were all alike
in the matter of wheel spacing.

Thus, we have the answer to the original questions. The United State
standard railroad gauge of 4 feet, 8.5 inches derives from the original
specification for an Imperial Roman army war chariot. Specifications and
Bureaucracies live forever. 

So, the next time you are handed a specification and wonder what horse's
ass came up with it, you may be exactly right. Because the Imperial
Roman chariots were made to be just wide enough to accommodate the
back-ends of two war horses.
