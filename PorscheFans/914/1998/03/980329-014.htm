OK, this brings up an issue with me. If the top of the piston is designed
to heat up to a certain temperature and expand to fit the cylinder, then
what happens when you take measures to reduce heat transfer to the piston,
as in ceramic coatings, etc.? Further, what if sliding friction is
substantially reduced, as when the cylinder bores are coated with nodular
thin dense chrome, will the reduction in heat generated from the sliding
friction have the same effect of not heating up the piston enough? I've
talked with the companies that produce both products (ceramic coatings and
NTDC), and they both said that it is not a problem. The ceramic coatings
guy highly recommended his product for VW motors. Of course, these people
are not unbiased sources. After reading about VW motors for a while, it
appears that the problem is too much heat, and that no one has run up
against too little heat. Does this sound at least halfway reasonable? That
coating the piston tops with ceramic and NTDC coating the cylinder bores
would not be a problem vis-a-vis piston top expansion to fit the cylinder?
