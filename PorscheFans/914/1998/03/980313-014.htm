Hi there.  A few of you may have been experiencing some problems with our 
response time as of late.  I would like to sincerely apologize for any slow 
down in our customer service lately.  The truth of the matter is that the 
positive feedback and response to the website has been completely 
overwhelming, and has also caught us off guard.

Tom and I started this business back in early January based on the idea 
that we would start a website, and build business slowly.  We had no idea 
that we would be getting so much traffic and business that we would not be 
able to keep up with it all.  I must thank everyone for their positive 
comments and feedback regarding the site, and we are striving to improve 
and add to it every week.  It still amazes me the response that we have 
been getting; even some of our competitors have asked to advertise on the 
site.

The bottom line is that Tom and I (we're both owners and the only two 
employees), are struggling to keep up with the flood of phone calls and the 
tidal wave of email (typical day is about 50-75 emails).  I answer each and 
every email that comes into my inbox, as some of you may have noticed.  I 
want to make sure that everyone knows that there is someone on the other 
end of the email chain.

When we 'opened' our virtual doors this January, Tom and I decided that the 
safe approach would be to keep our regular daytime jobs.  Tom has a young 
daughter to support, and I have an expensive Porsche habit.  Needless to 
say, we did not anticipate the overwhelming success of the website.  The 
large flow of email and calls has meant that Tom and I have been easily 
working 110 hour work weeks.  We realize that there is a problem and we had 
a late night conference last night, and came up with a solution that will 
be implemented in the next few weeks.  In the meantime, I will be working 
closely with Tom to make sure that our customers do not feel neglected.  We 
will be having the phone manned full-time in about three weeks.  That, we 
realize is an absolute necessity.

In the meantime, we ask for your patience as we struggle through our 
'growing pains'.  Tom and I are dedicated to customer service, which means 
it really pains us when customers get 'dropped' or have to wait for return 
phone calls.  That is not our philosophy, and I would rather not be in 
business than be in business and have poor customer service.

Once again, thanks for all your support.  It is our goal to keep our 
customers happy, and we will do whatever it is in our power to achieve this 
goal.

Please feel free to email me if you have any comments or questions.

Thanks,

Wayne R. Dempsey and Thomas C. Gould
Owners,  Pelican Parts.

P.S. Many thanks to the people who have and will be helping us through this 
transition period.
