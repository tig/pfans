>not making up these efforts: I have personally viewed them on a
>wonderful videotape that was sent to me by Larry Claypool and Kirk
>Parro, who are members of the Chicagoland Corvair Enthusiasts.
>    (Perhaps you are thinking that people who are enthusiastic, in an
>organized way, about Corvairs are perhaps - to use a psychological term
>- several drawers shy of a file cabinet.  Let me assure you that you are
>correct.)
>    Here's the background: One day Claypool and Parro were reading a
>publication called Corsa Communique, which is the official magazine of
>the Corvair Society of America, and they came across an article
>headlined:
>
>    VACUUM CLEANERS AND SIPHONS DON'T MIX
>
>    The article was written by a person named Chess Earman, who
>recounted what happened once when he was trying to siphon the gasoline
>out of one of his four Corvairs.  He didn't want to get gasoline in his
>mouth, so he decided to get the suction going by holding the end of the
>siphon hose up against a vacuum cleaner hose.  What this meant, of
>course, is that he was sucking gas fumes directly into an electric
>motor, which as you know operates by having sparks fly around inside
>it.  So the next thing Chess Earman knew, there was an explosion inside
>the vacuum cleaner, and fire was coming out of the back of it "like a
>jet engine."
>    Fortunately Earman was able to unplug the vacuum cleaner before
>anything really bad happened.  But this was indeed a chilling cautionary
>story about the extreme danger of messing around with gasoline and
>vacuum cleaners, and when Larry Claypool and Kirk Parro read it their
>natural reaction, as guys, was : Hey, cool.
>    "Such a challange must not go unmet." is how they put it in a letter
>to me.
>    And thus it came to pass that, for a number of years during the
>1980s, the big attraction at the annual Fourth of July picnic of the
>Chicagoland Corvair Enthusiasts was the Flaming Vacuum Cleaner
>competition.  I wish you could see the videotape, because it is
>difficult for me, using mere words, to convey the full flavor of the
>event.  But I will try.
>    Each year, contestants brought vacuum cleaners, which were grouped
>into teams under signs denoting their brands (TEAM HOOVER, TEAM
>ELECTROLUX, etc.).  One by one, these vacuum cleaners were brought out
>into the competition arena where they were introduced by an announcer
>over the public-address system.  The vacuum cleaner nozzle would be
>placed in a shallow pan of gasoline.  Then everybody would retreat to a
>safe distance, and the vacuum cleaner would be plugged in to a 240-volt
>power source, causing the motor to start so the gasoline was being
>sucked in through the nozzle.
>    Usually nothing happened for a few seconds: then there'd usually be
>a BANG and the vacuum cleaner would jump a few inches into the air.
>This always got a cheer from the crowd.  Various things would happen
>next, depending on the vacuum cleaner,.  Some models would emit a cloud
>of black smoke and stop running, causing the crowd to boo.  But other
>models would send out a jet flame shooting several feet out the back for
>several seconds.  A few hardy models kept running for several minutes:
>the longer they'd run the more the crowd would cheer, encouraged by the
>announcer.  Sometimes the flames would stop and inevitably you'd hear
>somebody - it always sounded like the same guy, a guy who has been
>drinking a lot of beer - shout "MORE GAS!"  Certain canister models -
>these were the most popular with the crowd, getting wild cheers of
>approval - would explode violently apart with the tops flying up and out
>of the camera's range of view.
>    "The canister tops often exceeded altitudes of thirty feet." report
>Claypool and Parro.
>    After each contestant was finished, it would be dragged off and
>dumped onto a growing, smoking mound of charred and mangled machinery,
>and the announcer would say something nice about it, such as, "Not bad,
>Electrolux Number Two!" or "Let's hear it for the Eureka!"
>    On tape, between contestants, you occasionally see women walk past
>in front of the camera, on their way to get some more potato salad or
>something: they sometimes look at the guys, who are working
>industriously away the way guys do when they're on a Mission, getting
>another vacuum cleaner ready for action, and the women shake their heads
>in such a way as to clearly indicate that, yes, they knew guys could be
>idiots, but they had never realized that guys could be idiots of this
>magnitude.
>    Again, these women did not understand that the Flaming Vacuum
>Cleaner competition was, in fact, a relatively positive activity for
>guys to engage in - that if the guys didn't have this outlet, they could
>easily become involved in something with far more serious consequences.
>I am sure that none of us wants to pick up our morning newspaper and
>read the headline that says CHICAGO FEARED VAPORIZED IN MISHAP INVOLVING
>EXPERIMENTAL NUCLEAR-POWERED CORVAIR.
>    No, the Flaming Vacuum Cleaner competition was probably a good
>thing.  I want to stress, however, that it was also a very dangerous
>thing, not to be attempted by amateurs.  Remember that the guys who did
>it were not ordinary, untrained civilians: They were Corvair
>enthusiasts.  And they took certain critical safety precautions, such as
>rigging up a public address system.  You must remember that gasoline and
>vacuum cleaners do not mix, and under no circumstances should you
>attempt to do anything like this yourself.  And if you do, please let me
>know where you are.
