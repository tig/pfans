Subject:   Safety - Alloy Wheels

  This concerns alloy wheels originally manufactured by "HANDS"; 
later manufactured by "Western"  and which also appeared under the
trade names of "P/S" and "Gurney"....
HOWEVER... it may be applicable to others as well.

   CHECK FOR CRACKS!

   In my particular case, I was removing a "hubcap" in preparation
for having a tube installed in a chronically leaky tire.   My
"hubcaps" are secured to the wheel by four #6-32 screws that go
through tabs on the edge of the "hubcap" and into threaded holes
drilled into the wheel itself.   Upon getting close enough to the
wheel to remove these screws, small cracks were observed radiating
from two of these screw holes in the direction of the rim.  The
cracks were aproximately 3/4" long, and were not at all obvious
except on close inspection.

   It was decided to scrap the rim on the basis of these cracks... a
decision which proved to be very wise, and sooner than expected.  
When the tire technician mounted this wheel on his hydraulic tire
de-mounter machine and proceeded to remove the tire, the operation
was accompanied by a loud, sharp report.   On inspection, the small
cracks had propagated clear through the center of the wheel out to
lightening holes on opposite sides of the wheel, and the metal on
opposite sides of these cracks was displaced in a direction parallel
to the wheel's axis by a noticeable amount.   This degree of fracture
would, I believe, be described as a "catastrophic" failure in any
NTSB report.

   If this had occurred during hard cornering, or even during normal
driving, the results would have been spectacular, to say the least.  
I would imagine that the wheel would have been sufficiently deformed
that the tire would depart the rim, even if the wheel bolts held the
two halves together.   It is easily possible that the failure could
have propagated into a hub failure as well, owing to the sudden,
unbalanced forces involved.   The potential exists for loss of the
car, and even loss of life.

   It is therefore urged that alloy wheels be CLOSELY inspected on a
regular basis, and that any apparent cracks be adjudged as sufficient
cause for retiring the wheel.
