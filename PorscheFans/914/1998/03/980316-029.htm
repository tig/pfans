Jeff,

I always have disconnected the fuel lines under the car, before the pump,
near the exit from the firewall.  I then let the fuel drain into a catch
can until the tank was dry.  I've also done it with an extra GM high
pressure pump which I hooked up to a battery charger (with LONG wires) and
drained the lines that way.  Either way, your still likely to get an arm
full of fuel when you disconnect the lines under the tank.  By the way, the
best way to do that is to cut them, and replace with new lines when you
reinstall the tank.  And make sure the new lines are long enough so you
have plenty of room to work under the car. 

Also, take the hood off.  It makes life much easier.

Let me know if I can be of any hands-on help.  I installed a through body
swaybar last year.

Later,

Dion
