I just got off the phone with Greg Ehalt, (412)823-1030, of Armoloy in
western Pa. They have a chrome surface process that is truly impressive. He
said they do a lot of racing engine work, including cylinders, cranks,
camshafts, lifters, etc. They have a minimum charge of 75$, which would do
about 15 bearing surfaces. He says that it's a nodular surface with an rms
value of 8 (roughness). The surface inheriently traps oil, so it is
excellent for cylinder bores. He was not aware of any special rings that
would be required in this application, but he did say that you can run two
armoloy surfaces without oil and no gawling will occur. Check out the web site:

I have a 4 speed transmission that has some needle bearing surfaces that
have seen better days. I'm going to have armoloy process them right after I
get the shafts cryogenically tempered. If you think that is nuts see the web
site:
