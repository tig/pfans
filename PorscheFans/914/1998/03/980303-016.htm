There's actually 4 steps to installing a timesert.  First you need to drill
out the original hole and threads.  Then there's a second counterbore; this
creates a recessed hole for the shoulder of the timesert.  Then you tap the
hole for the actual insert.  Finally, there is a an insert driver to install
the insert. The way the timesert works is that the bottom few internal threads
of the insert are incomplete.  When using the insert driver, it actually forms
the bottom internal threads.  This expands the insert, and forces the bottom
external threads into the surrounding material, locking it in place.  This
is from the company's literature.

I haven't received my kits yet, so I don't know about the tightness of the
threads, but I imagine that can be controlled by how the inserts are made.
I think studs are locked into place by torque just like nuts; I don't see
how a timesert wouldn't allow a stud to be torqued into place like regular
threads, other than maybe the insert giving out.  It turns out the size
I need for the tranny is the same size as the case studs (10x1.50; 911
mag case), and everything I've read recommends time-serting a Mg case
when rebuilding.
