Greetings p-nuts,

Guys-once again I seek the collective wisdom...on the SAME problem I've
asked about before on this list...

Can anyone tell me whats' up with these %$#& front brakes?  I've got this
super-annoying squeal problem and I haven't been able to resolve it thus
far...

Heres what I've done (in chronological sequence)

1. first noticed squeal, removed the original pads, beveled the edges and
cross-sliced the pads, and applied "CRC anti squeal", a goo that looks
sorta like RTV, to the backs of the pads...re-assembled everything.  No
difference-still squealing
2. took everything apart again, REPLACED the pads, beveled and cross-sliced
new pads, AND turned the rotors this time and applied the same goo on the
backs of the pads (Like the first session)...re-assembled everything. No
difference-still squealing
3. Took everything apart again (3rd time...) replaced the pads AGAIN with
what I think are softer, street pads, beveled the edges and cross-sliced
the pads, and applied this same goo on the backs of the pads...re-assembled
everything. No difference-still squealing

Needless to say I've gotten a little frustrated by now...

4. took everything apart AGAIN (4th time)...simply cleaned the backs of the
pads and applied a Permatex spray product (switched from the CRC goo).  I
also sprayed the little clip/plates that go between the pads and the
caliper pistons.  Re-assembled everything.  NOW theres' a difference...it
doesn't seem to squeal as much, but the "problem" is still there.  I still
squeal at low speeds and approaching stops.  Damn thing sounds like an old
volvo!

Questions:
1. Am I missing something completely?
2. Although the car does NOT pull to either side, possible that I may have
a caliper problem?(the whole brake system is stock; master cylinder,
rotors, calipers etc...the calipers were re-built by me about two years
ago)
3. Is there a very specific brake pad I should be using in order to shut
things up?
4. Even though the rotors have been turned-possible that they are the
problem? (I don't see how..someone will have to lecture me on this one...)
5. the "cross-slicing" I referred to above is a single cut through the
middle of the pad, going ACROSS the rotor, the beveling is done on the
three edges; front, top and bottom of the pad...possible this could
contribute to problem? rather than be part of the solution?
6. Speaking of those little clip/plates that go between the pad and the
caliper piston, I'm not sure what purpose THEY serve...what exactly is
their function? can I take em out?

I apologize for this lengthy post...but I'd appreciate any insights.
Anyone been here? done this?  Like I said, this problem has me bugshit...I
hate noisy brakes of any description.  funny thing is, I don't remember
this being such a problem before, even on my previous 914...,

Cheers...and thanks in advance
