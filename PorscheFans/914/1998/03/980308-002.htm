Jim,
I've been running 205/60s mounted on Fuchs on my street driven 914 for
the last 3 years and haven't had any problems.  The rear portion of the
front tires do rub the inner fender at full lock but this hasn't been a
problem for me (quick cure with 1/8in. wheel spacers so I'm told).  The
rears are a tight fit, but haven't rubbed at all.  I know some people who
do have rear fit problems, but I think that is due to poor body work in
the past.  I've been using Mich XGTVs and the stand up remarkably well
for day to day driving with an occasional drivers ed.  I understand that
the guys on this list like to recommend a Dunlap product but I don't have
any experience with them.
