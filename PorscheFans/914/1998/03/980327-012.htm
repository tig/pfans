	I don't know how they did it on the assembly line, but the tool
that you can (or could, at any rate) buy from Porsche is pretty much
just a flat bar with a notch in it near one end.  You hook the notch
over the torsion bar and push.  Not much better than the box-end-wrench
method that I used.
	Mike Cooley has come up with a really very nice tool for the
job.  It will hold the bar in place so you don't have to keep pressure
on it.  It's called the "Ricky-doo" tool, and RD Rick has one.  He used
to rent it out, I'm not sure if he still does.  Mike was nice enough to
send me the drawings for it, so I might eventually talk my step-dad into
making one up for me.
	The Ricky-doo is in the broadest sense just a clamp that you
clamp onto the middle of the torsion bar.  The clamp is circular, with
holes drilled into it from the edges.  You use two pry bars in the holes.
Use one bar to turn the clamp (and the bar with it), and then put the
other bar into the next hole.  The second bar rests against the edge of
the engine compartment, and keeps the bar from un-twisting.  You can re-
peat as many times as necessary.

	Like I said before, it's really nice knowing such smart (and
creative!!) people!
