A few weeks ago I posted a question about top end rattle in my engine. I 
have a '73 1.7, with 1.8 heads and the 1.911 jug/piston setup, SCAT cam, 
dual Webers.  I found out that the problem was loose valve guides in the 
heads.  Actually, on cylinders 1 and 2 the intake guides were loose enough 
to run up and down on the valve stems.  Thus, severe oil smoke due to oil 
being sucked down into the cylinders.  So if you have a sudden 
rattling/slapping sound that comes and goes and gradually gets worse to 
the point of sounding like a knock, that may be the culprit.  You can 
normally tell if it's an intake valve problem by removing the intake 
manifolds and using your finger to see if the guides will move around on 
the stems.  At least mine did.  I was previously running Weber 44s, and 
I'm about to install 40s, and an oil sump.  Hopefully, it'll run cooler 
and get better mileage.  

Now for the oil question.  I've been running Castrol GTX 30w until now, 
and I'm considering going to a fully synthetic oil.  Any recommendations 
based on experience?
