Mike,     This is an old story, enough to make anyone mad. You have the
dreaded rusty longitudinals.
    1st. Check for the extent of the rust out. remove the lower
fasteners on the outer rockers (you may have to chisel these if they're
rusted badly) and pull the lower edge of the outer rockers out away from
the body. Be prepared for a cloud of dirt, rust, mouse nests, and all
those other socks that have been missing from your laundry. Behind the
outer rocker is the longitudinal, a boxed sheetmetal section that runs
from the rear suspension area to the front fender, and which serves as
the main structural element of the body. It is likely to be severely
perforated with rust, esp. in the jacking point area. Note well the
extension of the rusty areas; does it extend significantly past the
lower welded seam of the longitudinal to the floor pan?
   2nd. check the inner section of the longitudinal, inside the car.
Pull the seat out, and various trim and get the carpet down from the
inner door sill, check that lower seam for rust.
     Repair wise you have some options. If the majority of the rust is
in the outer section of the longitudinal, and the pan from the lower
seam in is mostly OK, you can go with something like Brad Mayeur's
reinforcing pieces, which fit over the outer longitudinal, inside the
outer rocker, and tie into the rear trailing arm mounting plate. You can
weld, can't you. Auto Atlanta makes a repro outer longitudinal that I
presume is a near exact match of the original piece, which will probably
take considerably more prep to properly install, but is original in the
common sense of the word. If you don't weld, look for another car,
possibly the apocryphal "rust-free roller", and transfer all you
goodies. Or spend a couple of hundred on a wire welder, and learn to go
for it.
      I have used the Mayeur pieces and they were not too bad to install
with patience and practice. contact me if you have any more questions re
this.  Jim S.
