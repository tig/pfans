	I remember someone saying that the plugs were supposed to be one-
way valves.  I don't know if that is right or not...  But that is definitely
one place you gotta clean out every once in a while.  (Another is behind the
outer rocker panel.  Undo the three screws on the bottom...)

>2nd thing that doesn't make sense to me is the passenger side warm air guide.

	The guides are there to make sure that the air blows correctly across
all the cooling fins for both cylinders on each side, as well as the heads.
When you pull off the guides, you start messing with the air-flow, and can
develop hot spots (and cool spots) that weren't designed into the motor. This
can cause problems, eventually.
	I read once in a book about 30's-vintage air-cooled aircraft motors
that the big two-bank radials would overheat without the sheetmetal that
apparently covered more than half of their cooling surface.  People took that
ducting off, and suddenly very little cool air made it back to the rear bank
of cylinders--which promptly overheated and failed!
