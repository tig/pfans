	We had the first event of the year up at Candlestick (the Park
Formerly Known As) this Saturday.  There were a couple of problems,
which resulted in us only getting ten official timed runs and no fun
runs.  Aaaawwww...  I hate when that happens!
	It took a little while to get the timer sorted out, and to get
things running smoothly.  Still, not bad at all for the first event.
And nobody felt like cleaning up after fun-runs in the rain, so the
official runs were all we got.  That's OK, they were fun enough!
	The course was a very fun one, modelled after a course the late
Doug David designed last year.  The event was run in his honor, and I
hope he was looking down and liked what he saw.
	The course had two slaloms, a decreasing-radius sweeper, a
bunch of chicanes, one of which was between the two gated sections of
the course.  The second, larger gated section was driven by most people
as another sweeper with a hairpin turn tacked onto the end.  Speeds
were moderately high, with 3rd gear (in a 914) needed in quite a few
places.  (That's over 50, for those of you who don't know your red-
line speeds.)  There was one area where I thought we would go over a
bump while under braking, but it turned out not to be an issue.  Times
ranged from just over 50 seconds to over a minute.
	I struggled with a push during the four morning runs (with times
just at 60 seconds), then dialed my rear shocks stiffer to even out the
handling.  I also had Larry Jackson ride with me.  Larry has a light-blue
73 2.0.  You can tell the difference between our cars because his has no
roll-bar vinyl, while mine has no roof.  He pointed out a few things that
I had been trying to do (but failing), and a few other things that I
hadn't seen.
	My times immediately dropped below 58 seconds--amazing what a few
small changes will do!  I finally pulled off a 56.7, a time which I am
very happy with!  I think Larry got very nervous at seeing me that close
to his own time, what with him being in the next class up...
	My last run was made with the roof on the car.  (Sigh!)  It had
started raining, and enough time is spent sitting still on grid that the
rain does come right in--not like highway driving!  And I do indeed bump
my helmet on the roof even without a bottom seat cushion.

	Not only is autocrossing a real blast, but it's even better when
you break through one of those performance blocks and start driving the
way you think you should be!
