Thanks,  it's good to hear from several people that have had good
experiences with them.  They may just be having a bad couple days.

I'll give them another shot the next time I need to order some parts.

Hi Jeff:
I've ordered a *LOT* of stuff with them recently without  any problems
at all - great prices and response time to my questions and shipments...
Frankly, I ordered from GPR, AA, Stoddards, Automotion, Team
Motorsports, Europroducts, and bunches of others in the past - but
Pelican was at least as good as those folks and typically much
better....  Sorry you had a bad experience, but it's not at all similar
to mine...  And nope, I'm about as far away from CA (Pelican Parts) as
you can get - they've shipped all my stuff to NH without a glitch...
John
