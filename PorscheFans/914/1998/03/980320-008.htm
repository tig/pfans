Thanks for this, I've been wondering also.  My drivers window also does
this and as far as I've found so far I don't have rust that would be
weakening the body enough to flex.  I'll be checking for sure when I gut
the interior to deal with some surface rust and plan to open up the side
rocker access holes in the sill and check for sure.  If they are clear I'm
going to spray some of the waxy undercoating material in there to make sure
no rust starts.

Let me know how the adjustment works for you Bill.

Bill:
Along the bottom edge of the door, near the front, there are two
screws locked in place by nuts.  Loosen the nuts, then turn the
screws.  As I recall, the screw pointing UP adjusts the
forward-and-back angle and the screw pointing OUT adjusts the
left-to-right tilt of the window... But I could be wrong, since I
don't have my Haynes manual handy (it details the whole procedure
and has a lot of photos).
There's also a travel-limiting bolt on the regulator... With the nner
door skin off, you'll see it in the hole just to the rear of the
window crank.  To adjust it, you roll the window all the way up,
loosen the bolt until it stops turning, then tighten the locknut.
Again, I'm pretty sure that the Haynes manual has photos.
