Jim,
   You are indeed correct in saying that the Kolbenschmidt Euro pistons are 
dished.  I didn't know anything about the Kolbenschmidt pistons; I learned 
about this for the first time tonight.  I love it when I learn something 
new!

 I have updated the page on our site with a note that the pistons shown are 
Mahles.

I'm not sure where you got your numbers for the volume of the combustion 
chamber.  A quick glance through the factory manuals, and spec books 
doesn't readily reveal the answer.  I do know that the Mahles shown on our 
page are indeed for the 2.0L motor.

My rough calculations reveal that the final combustion chamber size for the 
2.0L motor should be approx 259 cc with the USA pistons, and approximately 
246cc with the Euro pistons.  This means a difference of about 13cc.

Assuming that the dish is about 7.5 cm wide and .3 cm deep that comes out 
to be approximately 13cc.  So the numbers appear to match.  Perhaps someone 
can check me on this.

If anyone has info or pictures of the regular and Euro Kolbenschmidt 
pistons, I will update the page.  Please email me directly as I am so busy 
that I do not get to keep up with reading the list as often as I would 
like.

Many thanks Jim,

Wayne

Hi Wayne!

   I saw your letter to PorscheFans with the piston pictures on your
web page.   I am quite sure that Kolbenschmidt Euro pistons do in
fact have a dish.   I think that the Mahles do also, but am not as
sure about this.
   Based on my spreadsheet for compression ratio calculations, I
would say that any flat-topped piston would have such high
compression that cylinder shims would be a necessity, unless the
distance from gudgeon pin to crown was quite a bit smaller in the
flat-topped piston.   If this was the case, then the piston side-load
characteristics would be altered considerably from stock pistons.
All of this is based on 2 litre engine parameters; someone on the
list suggested that the flat-topped pistons may be intended for use
in a 1.7 or a 1.8, which have different heads and therefore (it is
assumed) different chamber volumes.
   I therefore suggest that you qualify your picture with the brand
name of the pistons involved, and specify the bore diameter (and / or
engine displacement) for which they are intended, and possibly a
disclaimer that other brands of Euro pistons may have dished tops.
I think that this would tend to reduce confusion amongst the many 914
owners out there who use your web page as a valuable reference tool,
which it is.

  On another subject, could I get a quote from you on a rebuilt
distributor for a '74 Porsche 914 with 2.0 litre engine?

					Thanks,
                                                            Jim T.
