I have a '73 914 1.7.  Over the weekend, I got a leak on a fuel line
underneath the engine compartment near the fuel pump.  (Ruined my
Saturday.)

I replaced the fuel lines in the engine compartment a couple months ago.
But, I put off replacing the fuel filter and the lower lines.

So on Saturday I siphoned the gas tank and started replacing the lower fuel
lines.  I had a fuel filter ready to go in but it turns out I had the
wrong part:  my car has a bigger fuel line coming from the tank so the
filter needs to have a 9mm nipple on one side and 7mm on the other.
I'll have the correct filter hopefully tomorrow.

But, while I'm at it, I want to replace the plastic fuel line that goes
between the engine compartment and the fuel pump.  In Dave Darling's
Hose Diagram, this line is described as "Flexible plastic fuel line; 7mm
outer diameter".  These lines go directly underneath the battery :-( .

Where can I get these segments of fuel line?  What exactly should I ask for?

Any help is appreciated!
