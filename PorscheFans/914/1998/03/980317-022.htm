Not to start any arguments about rotories, but my experience hasn't been
all that rosie with the fabled rotory engine.  My younger Brother has had 3
RX-7's.  Since I am the mechanically inclined one, and he lived with me
while going to school, I ended up working on all 3 cars regularly with his
help.  Those are amazing little engines.  Lots of power in the midrange all
the way up past redline.  And they make a strange sound too.  :)

But if something happens to my flat four, I drop it in less than an hour
and rebuild it over a weekend.  For the most part, rotories can't be easily
rebuilt by the backyard mechanic.  And rebuilt motors from MazdaTrix and
others aren't all that much cheaper than a nicely built 140 hp flat four.
Believe me, with all the Mazda stuff sitting around the house and garage
(including a parts car with a strong engine), the thought of dropping a
rotory in my 914 crossed my mind several times.  But after you stare at one
of those things long enough trying to figure out yet another problem, all
transplant thoughts vanish.  By the way, all RX-7's are gone now.  This
year he's autocrossing a Neon R/T!

Also, with both of us on street tires and my engine relatively stock, we
were pretty much even at last year's autocrosses when he had his 1985 RX-7
with a 12A engine. 

4 years ago I even owned an 85 RX-7 with the 13B.  We had to finally get
rid of it; engine troubles.
