Hey all!
I got back some really excellent numbers from Jim T. regarding my 2.0 cyl=
inder shims but it did raise another question...
What compression ratio should I shoot for?
I have a '73 2.0 that sits on a trailer.  It's used for mostly auto-x, =
wanna do some time trials, but since it's smog liberated I also want to =
be able to drive it up the coast, (read street-able).
I believe, I have euro pistons in it, but everything is stock including =
the fuel injection.  An external oil cooler will be going in when I get =
the motor together as well.
My initial thought was go for something a little higher than stock CR. =
 If stock on a euro is 8.0:1 then what about 8.5:1?  Anybody doing this =
now?  The cost of gas isn't a biggie, but I would like to stay away from =
super-duper unleaded, (the midgrade stuff would be ok).
Comments? Opinions? .02's?  lay it on me!
Thanks!
