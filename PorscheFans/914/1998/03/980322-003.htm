Well, gang, I ran my 914 in the first points event of the Atlanta Region
SCCA season, today. During my second run I heard a bzzzzzzt sound as I
entered a turn. The car negotiated the rest of the cours without any undo
sounds or problems. When I got back to grid I looked under the car to see
if a tire was rubbing. Instead I spied a large puddle of oil emanating
out of the front of the engine.

After putting the car on the trailer, I crawled under the trailer for a
better look. It doesn't appear the oil is coming from the filter or
cooler area. It seems to be coming from the front of the engine, either
front seal or oil pump area. Someone suggested a blown out galley plug.

Any ideas? Before I tear into my latest project?

Thanks,
Ben
