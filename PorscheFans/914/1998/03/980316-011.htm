        Container to catch waste brake fluid.

*CAUTION: BRAKE FLUID IS POISON.
*DO NOT GET FLUID ON YOUR PAINT AS IT WILL DESTROY FINISH.
*PADS WILL HAVE TO BE REPLACED IF FLUID GETS ON THEM.
*MAKE CERTAIN RESERVOIR IS VENTED PROPERLY.


Fill your reservoir with FRESH brake fluid.
Maintain reservoir at minimum of 1/2 full (refill as necessary).
*Check reservoir often to see it is full.*
*The tube must be submergered below fluid level in container.*
*Please note there are 2 bleeder valves on BOTH REAR brake calipers.*
*RIGHT is driver side. LEFT is passenger side.*
*Bleed brakes in this order ONLY:
        RIGHT OUTSIDE REAR CALIPER
        RIGHT INSIDE REAR CALIPER
        LEFT OUTSIDE REAR CALIPER
        LEFT INSIDE REAR CALIPER
        LEFT FRONT CALIPER
        RIGHT FRONT CALIPER

Attach the bleeder tube to the right OUTSIDE rear bleeder valve.
Insert the tube into a container which has brake fluid in it.

Have assistant pump brakes until pressure is built up.
Have assistant HOLD pedal in DOWN position when told to do so.
Loosen the bleeder valve on OUTSIDE right rear brake.
Fluid will expell into container. Close bleeder valve.
Have assistant pump again and hold when pressure is felt.
Loosen the bleeder valve on OUTSIDE right rear brake.
Fluid will expell into container. Close bleeder valve.
Repeat this procedure until you do not see any air bubbles in container.

When satisfied, proceed to inside bleeder valve of caliper.
      
Now bleed the INSIDE bleeder valve on the right rear brake.
The bleeding procedure is exactly the same.

Repeat procedure on the left OUTSIDE rear wheel bleeder valve.
Repeat procedure on the left INSIDE rear wheel bleeder valve.

Repeat procedure on the left FRONT wheel bleeder valve.
Repeat procedure on the right FRONT wheel bleeder valve.

*Test your work for proper brake pedal before driving.*

Clean up your mess when finished bleeding brakes.
