    Josh:

    Are you SURE that the mixture is leaning out because the
    computer's telling it to?  You might want to take a look at the
    injector pulse-widths -- with a borrowed portable oscilloscope
    or, if you can find one, a D-Jet tester -- and see whether
    they're actually getting shorter.

    I don't know, but it MAY just be that the mixture's leaning out
    IN SPITE OF the computer's attempts to keep it rich.

    Yeah, I think you're wrong... Detonation is usually handled by
    RAISING the fuel/air ratio, not lowering it.

    Knock sensors are pretty tricky... They detect detonation either
    by directly measuring the gas pressure in the cylinders or by
    "listening" to the vibration on the outer surface of the
    cylinders.

    Either way, it's tough to distinguish between detonation and
    normal running; physical placement of the sensors is critical, a
    fair amount of filtering and thresholding of the signal is
    required, and knock sensors are individually "tuned" to the
    particular engine models they're installed on.

    No, it's not unhealthy... There's no load on the engine when the
    throttle's closed, so the lean running doesn't hurt anything.

    The computer DELIBERATELY shuts off the fuel flow when the
    throttle's closed, then starts the flow again when the revs drop
    to near idle-speed (or when you reopen the throttle).  Shutting
    off the fuel on the overrun has two advantages:

        1.  It increases gas mileage.
        2.  It GREATLY improves throttle response when you open the 
            throttle again.

    Unfortunately, cutting the fuel on the overrun also keeps the
    car from making those great crackling backfires and belching
    flame out its exhaust whenever you close the throttle.

    Oh, well... Can't have everything, I guess.
