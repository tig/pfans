Hi all, I have some questions regarding the proper way to split a 4 cylinder
to swap a cam. I an effort to save some time and money, and get my 914 done in
time for the East Coast Ramble, I am going to use a rebuilt 1.7 that I have
with approx 3K miles on it. This is a fresh motor that was set-up with dual
carbs, it has a big cam that WILL NOT work with my d-jet FI. This motor was
machined,balanced and assembled to spec. I hate to waste it.I have a brand new
WEB-Cam, #73 grind with lifters that I was saving for my 2.0L ,which is
currently apart awaiting machine work etc.. I want to put this cam in the
1.7L. My questions are: 1- when I remove the cylinders, if I don't remove the
piston from the bore,  can I reuse them? 2- if the piston rings leave the
bore, is it true that they won't seal the right way again? 3- Should I just go
ahead and hone the cyclinders and re-ring? 4- I will use new cam bearings, Can
the main crank bearings be re-used? Spliting the case should not affect them
correct?

Any advice is greatly appreciated. I'm looking foward to meeting all of you
that are comming to the East Coast Ramble in June.

Thanks,
Ed Villela

PS - I will be in Hollister CA, next week. Any local list members in this area
that would like to grab a beer or two?
