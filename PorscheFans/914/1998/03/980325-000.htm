Hi there, Mike.  Thanks for the compliments on the site.  Along with being 
a Porsche fanatic, I also have a Master's Degree in engineering, so in a 
word, I've done everything that you see on this site. (some of the cgi 
programs are canned, like the BBS, etc...)

For the answer to your question, look at this page:

http://www.pelicanparts.com/914/914QA/914Q_euro_vs_usa.htm

I don't think that you will have any more questions after that.

A new set of P&C Euros are $475 through us.  This is one of our specials, 
and I don't think that anyone else has them for any lower (well, I hope 
not...)

Please let me know if you have any more questions...

Thanks,

Wayne

Wayne-
I don't know if you've been following this thread on my euro pistons or 
not, but...
I have a 73 2.0 914 motor I bought used.  Took it apart and thought I found 
a small crack in one of the heads.  (The heads were almost new, and looked 
great except for the crack so I just sent the one)
MSHP did the head, and it now looks even better.  I measured my deck 
clearance, cc'd the heads and am now trying to figure what shims I need to 
get 8.5:1
The PO gave me recpts showing rebuilt heads and new "euro pistons" but in 
talking to the P-Fans guys it may be that they are not euro at all.

Jim T. says his are euro and have a 4 cc dish in the middle.

While Larry M. says and I quote, "those are early stock p's...nominal 7.6 
CR...  the later 2.0 had more dish & lower CR.  Euro p's have flat top as I 
understand it from the guys at GPR"

So the question remains, how can you tell a euro piston from anything else?

And, on a totally related topic: Let's just say these are not euros and a 
certain somebody wished to purchase euro's before putting his motor back 
together, how much in Titanic dollars are we looking at?

On a totally unrelated topic:  Love the site!  Lots and lots of info.  Who 
does all the html work for you.  I have fooled around with html, and am 
just starting to think I understand what I think I am doing.  Your site 
loads quickly, looks clean, and you can find what you want when you want 
it.  Nice job!

Thanks!
