Ben, I think your right....the 914 is rather heavy but an additional 100 to
150 lbs can really make a handeling difference....also everyone is talking
about all of these swaps with a stock iron block...how about a Buick 225 ci
all alum. v-8 which now can be found in Range Rovers.....even better I use to
be on a team that raced Outlaw sprint cars....Our Rodac all alum. v-8 block
could be picked up with one hand (bare) and easily weighed the same or less
than a 914...it also produced around 750 hp with Kinser injection...these
engines are more available than one would think with new ones manufacturered
in Paso Robles Ca. now! (when we quit racing in this series we had a hard time
getting any significant dollars for these engines)

Another interesting swap would be one of the neat overhead cam all aluminum
v-6's by the Japenese Mfg's....these are all popular in the dune buggy
world....I'm thinking about one of these for my Chenowith sand rail to replace
the 'ol Corvair engine and transaxel....and save a couple hundred pounds while
I am at it!

The Mazda is a high rpm engine lacking low end torque but a real
screamer.....there is a 914 with a rotary running regulary at the dry lakes
events at El Mirage and Muroc....

I'm far from a purist but my friends refer to Mazda engines as "paper plate
engines"  use 'em and throw 'em away! 
 
Get a hold of Kennedy Engineered Products (KEP) in Palmdale Ca. for a really
neat listing of engine and transmission weights and possible combo's....(805)
