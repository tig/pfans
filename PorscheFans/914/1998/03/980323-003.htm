I would almost guarantee that MSHP fly cut the #1 & #2 head.  A 6cc
difference is pretty substantial.  At this point, I would think that you
would need to use at least two cylinder base shims on that side, but only
one on the other side.  You'll need to measure the deck height on all
cylinders to find out for sure.  Also, how exactly did you check your deck
height, and were there any cylinder base shims installed, and where the
cylinder bolted down, or just pressed against the case?
