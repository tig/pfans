	JJ has some good suggestions.  However, I'd like to clear up one
or two minor points about how the cold-start enrichment works on the D-jet
engines.

	The Cold Start Valve is an extra fuel injector in the plenum (or
Intake Air Distributor or Manifold or...).  It has two wires going into it.
The wire that supplies power (+12V) to the valve is connected (in the relay
board) to the yellow wire that goes to the starter motor.  That's right,
the valve only gets power when the starter motor is cranking.  The other
wire from the valve goes to the Thermo-Time Switch.  This switch shorts its
input to ground when it gets cold enough.  I don't remember the operating
temp offhand.  When the switch is warmer, it opens the circuit.  So current
cannot flow through the CSV, even though the starter may be cranking.
	The Aux Air Valve (Auxiliary Air Regulator, whatever) serves ONLY
to give you a higher idle on start-up.  The AAR has one wire going into the
bottom of the "can".  This wire gets power (+12V) whenever the fuel pump
does.  (This includes the 1/2-second shot when you first turn the key.)
The power goes through a small heating element in the bottom of the can (it
only has about 13 ohms of resistance, so it doesn't heat much!).  Also in-
side the can is a bimetallic spring.  When heated, one of the two metals of
the spring expands more than the other.  This makes the spring move, which
closes a rotary valve going from one vaccuum hose to the other.  Note that,
if the engine is warm enough, the valve will be closed without getting any
power.
	The two vaccuum hoses serve to bypass the throttle.  One comes from
the air cleaner (and goes to the AAR), the other goes from the AAR to the
plenum.  When the valve is open, it lets air from the air cleaner (at ambi-
ent air pressure) into the manifold, without being blocked by the throttle
which may be closed.
	This raises the pressure in the manifold, which the Manifold Pres-
sure Sensor detects.  This causes the ECU to command more fuel to be squir-
ted by the (regular) fuel injectors.  Thus, the extra air from the AAR is
dealt with the same way that air coming in through an open throttle would
be.  (Ditto with most vaccuum leaks, which is why the D-jet system is so
tolerant of leaks, unlike the L-jet.)

	Things for Clark to check:  Ignition.  Always.  Let me repeat, when
you have an FI problem, check the ignition system first.  Inspect your spark,
make sure it looks good.  Check timing and dwell.
	After you've done that, you can start the FI system checks.  Check
the resistance of the Head Temp sensor.  It should be about 2.5K - 3K ohms
when cold, then <250 ohms when warm.  That  may help your backfires and rough
running.  Check that the MPS will hold a vaccuum.
	The backfires on deceleration might be a separate problem.  (Probably
not, though.)  The factory added the Decel Valve (same mount as the MPS; the
Haynes book calls it a pressure regulator or some such drivel) to help with
backfires on deceleration.  When the valve "sees" a very high vaccuum in the
small hose (from the manifold to the Decel Valve), it opens up the passage
from one of the large hoses on the valve to the other.  This creates yet
another path from the air cleaner to the manifold, letting air in just as if
you had opened up the throttle.  The very high vaccuum only occurs with the
throttle closed at high RPMs.
	If your decel valve is stuck closed, you may get some backfires on
deceleration.  You can check it by pulling off the hose from it to the air
cleaner (at the decel valve).  Rev the motor up to 3500 RPM or so, then let
the throttle snap closed.  You should feel air coming into the valve.  If
you don't, try going up to 5K RPM (if you can stand the noise).  If there is
still no suction at the valve when you close the throttle, then the valve
has failed.  Replace it or live with it.

	Good luck!
