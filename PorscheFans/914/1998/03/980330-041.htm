914ers,

This was in response to the thread about the O2 sensor.

I installed an O2 sensor in my Bursch so I could accurately review what my
engine was doing.  I had the poor experience of having a head temp sensor go
bad at a club race, and I didn't know what the engine was doing.

Anyway, I have a Halmeter 30 LED sensor with a 3 wire sensor.  The bung is
drilled into the two into 1 collector on the Bursch.  It sticks out the back
(I don't use a valence), so it kind of looks dumb , but it is easy to access
and was cheap to have the bung welded up.

My general opinion is that the FI seems to take a long time to adjust to input
from the electronics or the meter is slow to respond.  If I run it at full
throttle consistently, the meter slowly (takes 3-4 20 second WOT runs) inches
up the LEDs to the "rich" area.  I assume that this is from the enrichment
provided at full throttle from the TPS.  After running hard, the engine at
idle slowly (30-60 seconds) ratchets back down to the stoichiometric area.

I am using this to get ready to install a Kerry Hunter header (getting it back
from HPC this week) and get a modified throttle body from a rocket scientist
(literally) who works at McDonnell Douglas.  Hopefully, I'll have my hands
full getting enough fuel out of the D-jetronic.

Does anyone out there have any opinions about whether it is better to increase
the fuel pressure or use a pot to control head temp sensor?

The joke about this is I had a lot of blow by coming out the crankcase.  I
checked the compression.  The good news is that the compression is even across
all the cylinders.  The bad news is that it is only 90 - 100 psi.  I guess I
need to look at those nicely priced euro P&Cs from AA.
