Well I had a bit of time last night.

Checked the CO meter on my truck.  Appears to be accurate.  Showing about
..04 CO for the Tacoma which is FI, closed loop with a catalytic converter.
So I think I can trust the meter readings.

Wanted to do a quick check on the 914, maybe just try turning the ECU
control up from the full lean position in case it was now too lean to
start.  Before I did that I wanted to make sure I hadn't plugged in the
cold start valve since I couldn't remember for sure.  Just pulled off the
air cleaner to look then put it back.  Decided to try starting it before I
touched anything.

Started right up, arrrrrrrg.  Left it idle and went to look.  It was
putting out a lot of smoke from the exhaust that I'd never seen before.
Smelled of gas, dark back yard with just a drop cord so can't be sure of
color of smoke.  I rev'd it up for a bit and after about 15 sec it stopped
putting out smoke.  Tried wiggling the MPS connector but no change.  No
more time.

 I hate intermittent problems. So don't know for sure what is going on.
Could it have been flooded before?  How does a 914 FI act when flooded?  I
had been checking the TPS last and had manually run it through several
cycles while listening for the injector clicks.  That would explain the
smoke on startup, but that seems too easy.

I'm going to do more checking this weekend.  Got a tool so will repair the
MPS plug wires anyway, there are some broken strands.  Found the tool Kjell
mentions in his FI article.  Made by Lisle, #56500 Wire Terminal Tool,
$11.98.  Got at Pep Boy's.  It is a flat green hexagon, has a tool tip
sticking out of each side.  4 round tubes and 2 flat pieces.  Looks like it
will work for the various connectors.  I'll let the list know when I use
it.  Also found they now sell the nice GM WeatherPak connectors.  Both
premade with wire pigtails and also the individual parts.  Picked up the
parts to make a 3 wire connector to use with the 3 wire O2 sensor I'm going
to mount.  Anyone who has mounted a 3 wire O2 have a suggestion for the
best place to pick up the 12v for the O2 heater?  I'm figuring on tapping
into a 12v keyed line in the engine compartment.

On the question about the MPS connector orientation, when I repair the plug
I'm going to check the wires with my DVM so I know which should go where,
even if it doesn't matter.  On the MPS itself,  with the MPS mounted to the
fender and the hose connection pointing toward the front of the car, the
connections are numbered (from bottom/lowest to top/highest )  #15, #10,
#8, and #7    Since the coil wire pairs are #15/7  and #10/8  switching the
plug around keeps the coil connections to the same coils, just reversed so
it depends on the circuit whether this would matter.  I'll post once I
know.

If everything goes right I'll get this fixed, get the seals in the tranny
shifter and speedo drive to stop leaks and still take a right.  I can dream
;-)

Interesting side note, I was looking at the manual for my roommates old
Volvo P1800ES.  It's getting a rebuilt motor so he should get it back in a
couple months (getting it blueprinted by mechanic/friend).  Water cooled
but it uses the D-jet FI system also.  I'll have to take a look at it when
he gets it back. See how similar it is.  A source of spare parts ;-)

The saga continues.

I don't really know. If the number of turns on each coil is identical, I
don't think it would matter. A resistance check of each coil will confirm
this. You would think that if it mattered which way the plug went in, that
they would have made it keyed for one-way insertion.
