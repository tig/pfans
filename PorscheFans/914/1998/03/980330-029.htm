	The only cars that SHUT OFF the injectors on overrun are the very
early (70-some 71) cars WITHOUT the idle mixture knob on the ECU.  The one
function replaced the other.  According to Probst's FI book, the air-cooled
cars cool unevenly enough that this emissions-reducing idea (shutting off
the fuel) actually produced *more* emissions.  So they got rid of it.
	I believe that the ECU used the "throttle closed" part of the throt-
tle position switch to detect an overrun condition--coupled with either the
MPS signal or the signals from the trigger points.
	Regardless, Josh2's car does not have that function.
	The function of the Decel Valve is to let air into the manifold on
overrun (high RPMs, throttle closed == VERY high manifold vaccuum).  This
has the same effect as opening up the throttle--more air, more manifold
pressure, MORE FUEL.  Not less.  Therefore, the Decel Valve is helping the
situation, not hurting it!

	I would concur with Dirk and Andy that the leaning-out at sustained
high speeds is probably unintentional, and simply a result of the way the
NTC head temp sensor works.

	BTW, did you confirm the high-RPM WOT lean condition you mentioned
to me a while ago?  Just curious.
