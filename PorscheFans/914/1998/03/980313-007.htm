Hi,

     I have a '74 2.0 914 with D-jet. While I was driving home
the other day my car just died, well, actually it kind of died
and started runing then ran bad and died. It would start then
after this but wouldn't keep running. My plugs look black and
not sooty almost shiney but definately black. I just passed 
emissions a week ago, whew! But my car had otherwise been 
running well. Where to start debugging?

     Also, I thought I would try a new head temp sensor so
I can maybe fix the lean hunt problem. How much for a new
HTS? Plus I had to turn my idle screw all the way in (closed)
to get my idle close to 900rpms on the high side.
    Any ideas? Thanks.
