	The answer is "Yes".  You can take the car to a good machinist and
have him put a "timesert" in.  Or you can buy the installation kit and do
it yourself.  I'd be really tempted to leave this to the pros, though.  I
think the TimeSert installation kit kis kinda expensive, and I'm not sure
I trust myself to get everything perfectly lined up lying on my back under
the motor with a drill and...
	A first option, if you don't mind a lot of work that might not get
you anywhere, is to drop the exhaust on the one side, and pull the stud.
Check it for mangled threads, and for aluminum stuck in the threads.  If it
is just the threads on the stud (unlikely--steel stud vs. aluminum head),
you can try a new stud.  If you find aluminum in the threads of the stud,
then you'll need the timesert.
	You can also run a tap up into the hole to "clean up" the threads.
Be careful you don't cross-thread the tap.  It probably won't solve any-
thing.   8^(
	Oh, a "TimeSert" (brand-name, probably trademarked) is a little (a
very little) like a HeliCoil on steroids.  It is a steel threaded insert,
sort of like a nut that you put into a hole you drill in the head.  The
"time" part supposedly comes from the wasy the threads are done--a little
unevenly (differently-"timed") so that a stud or bolt will not come out as
easily--a little like a self-locking nut.
	Good luck!
