	As far as I know, valve adjusts are called for every 6K miles, or
every 2 oil changes.  (And, if I remember correctly, that's a little more
frequent than is called for in the owner's manual.)

>As the valves seat, should their clearances change substantially?

	Yes.  I waited 1500 miles after one of my head rebuilds (after one
or two initial checks) and found that I had just about ZERO clearance on
some valves.  They've been fine at 3K mile intervals (2 of them) since then.
I'll probably do every 3K for another oil change or two, then settle down
to every 6K.

	Naah, that's expected on a fresh valve job.  Don't let it phase you.
If you want to be sure, check the shop's work right after you get the car
back from them.  (Cold engine, of course!)  That will give you a feel for
how tight the adjuster is supposed to be on the feeler gauge.  (I personally
keep mine a little bit tight.)

>   does anyone know what the
>"book time" is for a valve adjustment?

	Book time should be 60-90 minutes, depending on the shop.  I can do
it in less if I'm motivated and don't have to change more than half of the
valves.  (But I know all the ins and outs of my car by now...)
