	I talked to the guys at Palo Alto Speedometer again today.  It's
a good place to do business with.
	I found out that the calibration on my oil pressure sender (the
standard aftermarket VDO 0-80 PSI one) is such that 180 ohms should read
80 PSI on the gauge.  All you do is hook up 12V to the '+' terminal on
the gauge, ground the [ground symbol] terminal, and put a 180 ohm resis-
tor (or a pot dialed to 180 ohms) from the ground to the 'S' or 'G' ter-
minal.  That's what the sender is sending when the oil pressure is 80 PSI.
	Now, of course, I need to go home and check the resistance of the
pressure sender circuit at other pressures as well...
	I had been afraid that the pressure sender was some sort of vari-
able transducer or some other complicated widgetry--now it appears that
it is simply a variable resistor that gets pushed on by the oil.  I like
it when the manufacturers do simple stuff like that!
	Soon:  More on my new gauges.
