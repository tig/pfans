   Brian is quite correct.   I obviously wasn't thinking that day...
at least not about that particular ramification!

  You've heard the old joke about the math major, physics major, and
engineering major who roomed together at college?  One night a fire
breaks out.   The math major gets up, goes down the hall, and
observes a water faucet and a fire bucket. "Ah-ha!" he says... " a
solution is possible!" and then goes back to bed.   The physics major
then gets up, goes down the hall, and observes the same bucket and
faucet.  He takes the further step of opening the faucet briefly, and
observes that there is water pressure available.  "Ah-ha" he says...
"A solution is not only possible, but practical!".  He then goes back
to bed.   The engineering major then gets up, goes down the hall,
fills up the bucket, and puts the fire out.

   I plead guilty to thinking like a math major, at least on this
occasion.  It is theoretically possible to calculate individual shim
thicknesses for each cylinder.   As Brian points out, however, this
is not such a good idea in practice.  (Sorry about that, chief.)
