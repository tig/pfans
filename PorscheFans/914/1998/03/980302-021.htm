	Point your Web browser to:  <http://www.dgi.net/914> for info about
the 914 Club.

	PCA is great.  I've met some really very nice people through it.
Most of the ones that I have any contact with (mostly autocrossers) will
practically bend over backwards to help you if you're in trouble.
	The national PCA magazine, _Panorama_, is extremely high-quality.
PCA is large enough to afford paid editors, etc., and to afford to produce
a very slick-looking magazine with very good content.  It doesn't always
have 914 content, but it's still worth a read even when it doesn't.
	PCA members also get a local newsletter, which is put out by a
local volunteer staff.  The quality of these varies a lot from Region to
Region, but they are usually interesting enough, and pretty well put
together.  These local newsletters are roughly equivalent to the newsletter
from the 914 Club.  They'll have stuff that's more specific to club events
in your area than the Twin Trunks Tribune (the 914 Club's newsletter) or
than Pano, but often no 914 content at all.  Again, it depends on the
particular Region.

	I think if I had to give up one, I'd stay a PCA member.  It is
much more active locally than the 914 club, with lots of different events.
Thankfully, I don't have to choose one or the other--I can stay in both
clubs.  The $56 per year (that's for both, not each!) is worth it.
