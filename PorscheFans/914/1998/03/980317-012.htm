Hey Josh-
This weekend I was up at Sears Point and there was a
SCCA race that we looked in on.

Tons and tons of RX-7's, very few Porsches, but I did see one that caught=
 my eye.
Oops, make that 2, I also saw beautiful silver restored 914-6 ex-racer. =

The guy said he bought it when it was a racer and restored it back to str=
eet.
Lots of details, but absolutley beautiful!
I looked under the car, he had jet coated the exhaust, no oil leaks, ever=
ything perfect!

But alas, I digress.  The car in question was a present day racer.
I didn't catch the car number,or the class but it was a green 914-6.
The car had what looked like a plexiglass or aluminum sheet mounted under=
 the body.
It was not bolted straight to the bottom, but hung down ~ 2" by bolts or =
rods.
I couldn't tell, but it looked like it went from the rear of the F wheels=
 to the front of the R wheels.
	<start Hank Hill impersonation>
"What the He**, whats he doing with that under there?"
	<end Hank Hill impersonation>
Any ideas? and what's it supposed to do?
If anybody knows, I'm dying to find out.

BTW: the race in which he ran in included a couple of 911 super-zoomies =
(the Cross car),
a 69-70 blue Targa, a 944T, and a couple of other 914's, which this drive=
r all beat!
Can't tell you what motor, but it was obviously a 6.

Thanks!
