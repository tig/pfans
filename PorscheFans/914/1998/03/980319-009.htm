Ed, The easiest modifications that you can make would be to go to
european P/C's.  This change will give you 5 hp as stated by Porsche. 
This is a gain of 5% without any machining modifications.  Moreover, the
changes are easily done and does not require any machining.  Widening the
cylinders will decrease cylinder life and will require bigger pistons and
rings.  While this is can be done, I believe the gain in hp over
increasing compression to europe specs, if any, will not be noticeable. 
If no other engine modifications are done this will keep you in stock
class.

The D-jet works just fine with a euro-spec engine.

Stock US spec engine has 95 hp.  Increasing the displacement 2.6% would
theoretically get you 98.713hp while an increase of  4.3% would yield
99.08 hp.

Increasing the compression ratio is the easiest to obtain the results you
are looking for and keep (some) money in your pocket.

As always, these are only opinions and you know what they say about
opinions.  They are like butts, everybody has one.
