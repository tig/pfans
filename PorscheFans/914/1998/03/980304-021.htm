What I found when I was looking for a rotor without a resistor is that it 
seems that all Bosch rotors have the resistor and so do rotors by 
Standard (I think).  The rotors that you get from many chain auto parts 
stores (Kragen, NAPA, etc.) do not have the resistor.  You can be sure of 
this with an ohm meter as someone suggested.  The metal may not be 
exposed, I have not seen a rotor like this.  However, the epoxy may be a 
giveaway since the resistor-less rotor I have is just molded plastic.  

Since I need to run a rotor without the resistor (hot ignition), I would 
love to hear from anyone who more people who find a difference with the 
resistor rotors.  I would also like to hear if you trace the problem to 
something else.
