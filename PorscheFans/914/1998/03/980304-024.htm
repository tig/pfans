JJ-
EeeGaks!  Hold on a minute here, let's get this straight.  MSHP are the =
right people to send the heads to but they're giving out misinformation =
regarding head gaskets vs. shims?  And they were going to send me just =
one set of the .010 shims.

About your compression... Could it be from rings?  Have you done a leakdo=
wn test?

As for the compression, I talked to Norm this a.m. at MSHP who said it =
would be ok to run without shims and the head gasket as long as the cylin=
ders and heads cc'd the same.  He also said to check my deck hieght.  I =
asked him if the increase in compression would overpower the stock FI, =
and he said it would be ok.

Well, I checked and the deck hieght is approx .034" /( .864 mm on my feel=
er gauge), the cam is stock, the valves are stock 2.0 size, pistons are =
supposed to be euro, the cylinders check out to 94 mm. I have not cc'd =
the heads yet but at this point I'm not so sure I need to if I'm back to =
headgaskets, eh?

So what do I do?  I could put the motor together with head gaskets, no =
shims, and go the safe route...

Anybody..., Anybody..., Ferris...?

Thanks for the info!
