	Hi, all!
	I'm going to be installing a differnt combination gauge in
my car soon.  I'm putting in the gauge that has the temp gauge in
the top of the combo gauge, with an extra light in the center for
the brake warning system.  I'm told that these gauges come from non-
center-console 2.0 cars.
	I have such a gauge from an early car.  It has a silver cone
in the center.  I am also told that this early version is more rare
than the later version, with no silver cone.  This one is in pretty
good condition--not concours, but definitely useable.
	I'm looking to trade for the later version.  I want my combo
gauge to match the rest of my gauges--no center cone.  I figure that
it would be better not to destroy a somewhat-rare piece by opening
it up and tearing the cone off.

	Of course, I would prefer not paying any of the shipping
myself, but we can always negotiate about it.   8^)
