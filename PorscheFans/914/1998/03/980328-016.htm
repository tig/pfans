actually the proper fitting procedure is to use a LONG feeler & slide it
down into the bore with the piston, head down... (no rings ) & this
whole discussion assumes a perfect bore.. if the cyl is worn & tapered
ya oughta throw it away... 914 spec says max. 01mm out of round & does
not mention taper, but one might infer that "play" is taper (below)

 if i said E was irrelevant I apologize.. it has to be close (0005 seems
reasonable) to D if the piston is "new".. knurling readjusts E to fit
the bore with the book spec clearances & combats tipping (rocking or
"slap"), which the feeler technique verifies..

 knurling has been a standard "fix" for some 40 yrs, and if done right
will extend the life of used parts for at least the duration of the rest
of the "engine overhaul"  (but that was in the old days when parts were
expensive & labor was cheap.. today the parts are cheap & the machinist
is expensive.. so nobody bothers to "repair" used parts with knurling,
etc)

the Porsche 914 spec book says the cyl/piston "play" is .02-.05mm NEW, &
..20mm used

if one is going to use the long feeler gage technique, be aware that
somewhere out there in spec books only sold to machinists is a spec that
tells the machinist that if he puts a feeler of a certain size downside
the piston, & then hooks a sensitive scale to the feeler, he should get
a certain "pull" in kilograms... but if one does not have this
sophistication it can be noted that clearances between .025-.038mm
(.001-.0015 in ) are in the range of average acceptability... so it is
all about your experience in "pulling " the feeler gage..

  if you can actually feel the piston rock in the bore, i'd say you have
JUNK!!.. TOSS IT!  the vw bug guys figured this out 20 yrs ago!

 just like JJ is trying to figure out how to "feel" the correct valve
clearance... "go/no-go" is always a safe way to do this

i seem to recall a while back that one of our listers was concerned
about piston fit cuz he saw a lot of clearance looking down at the top
of the piston in the bore... that is a natural gap.. it should be 030 to
040 under the bore size to compensate for heat expansion of the piston
"head" & is no reason to disassemble the engine!.

 conversely, it is impossible to determine the piston to bore clearance
unless one actually does disassemble it..... the measurement is actually
done by putting the piston upside down into the bore (no rings).....

i dunno if anyone outside the inner sanctum of piston engineering has
any knowledge of the expansion & flex characteristics of the slipper
portion of the skirt & it sure isn't in any spec books i've ever seen

on my 2.8 sixer I had to have the slipper cut down to clear the webbing
in the crankcase.. it looked pretty fragile, but has held up in 5
seasons of vintage racing
