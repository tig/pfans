Howdy, Yesterday I was playing around with my 914 2.0 trying to find the
cause of an of idle ( small throttle opening stumble). My co was 2.5 at
idle around 8.0 at 3500 rpm. When I just barley opened the throttle I'd get
a consistant miss along with a CO drop, sometimes as low as .5. Bad TPS, or
at least dirty contact spots, or mal adjusted. Adjusted, cleaned, no
change. Lets try the new one. Nope no better. Ok, lets dink with the MPS.
That moved the curve around but didn't change anything. ( I'll stop here to
say I just got thru doing a valve adj., new points, good dwell, timing set,
 condenser, plugs, wires were good, new cap, new non rev limiting rotor. no
detectable vacuum leaks , good grounds) so I put the MPS back to the start
value. Maybe it's broke. So I replaced the MPS with a different one (tons
of spares) no change. Then I thought, injection trigger points. Got the
spare dist. out that I use to check the points. They open, no junk, clean
surfaces. Try new points, no change. So I think maybe the computer is got a
funny imput, on goes a spare computer, no change. Well, time to put the
0-500 ohm resistor in line with the HTS. At about 300ohms starts to get a
little better, Yep it's a lean stumble. Kinda like not enough pump to cover
the hole ( carburator speak). Guess my header works pretty good. At 500
ohms its a little to fat at the top end for me, so I dial the resistor back
to about 350 ohms. Then I unplugged the temp sensor 2 on the plenum.
Stumble gone. Question, Does anyone know the range of values I should get
from the temp sensor? At this point I pressure cleaned the injectors with a
can of lubromoly stuff, just cuz I hadn't done it in a while. No change. I
believe the cause of my problem was a part throttle lean condition, from
the header along maybe along with a possible unfound vacuum leak. It is a
stock 2.0 that I run in J. It has about 2000miles of use with 2 track
events and 3-4 autocrosses. Leakdown values are ok. 5-8%.
