Hi John!

   I used plain old epoxy-based paint from Home Base.   So far, it's
sticking pretty well, and I didn't do as thorough a prep as you
did... just sand-blast, primer, and paint.

  I went with the original black color, but Dirk Wright (I think it
was him, anyway) suggests white for improved visibility.   The more I
think about it, the more I think he's right, and I would probably do
it in white next time, although you'd never make it through a
Concours with white!

					Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
