Wayne,

I'll keep this one short.  With all the massages that have goe back and
forth on this list about the perils of bleeding 914 brakes, I haven't found
this chore to be too difficult.

I recently put my suspension back together which included replacing all 4
calipers and new stainless lines on all four corners.  The MC resevoir was
almost empty, but not dry.  I filler the resevoir, tightened down the bleed
screws and my wife started pumping the brake pedal.  I went around to each
caliper, loosened the bleed screw, and let a little fluid out.  I did this
again all the way around.  We then did the traditional pump till the
pressure is built up and let the air bubbles out on each caliper.  Again,
twice at each caliper working my way around.

All in all, about 1 quart of fluid used.  This is about the fifth time I've
done this on the car, and it's worked with equal success each time.  I'll
also bleed them once more after I get a couple of trips around the
neighborhood streets.


Good luck,

Dion
