I'll have to agree with Dion that 914 brake bleeding doesn't have to be any
more difficult that any other car.  My only setback has been not removing
the filter screen at the m/c reservoir.  If the screen is not removed, the
m/c misleadingly appears full when it is not (the screen is too fine to
allow fluid to easily pass through).

I will say that "easy" bleeding does rely on the old standard
"pedal-pumping" method.  Vacuum bleeders seem to pull air/fluid from every
corner of the system *except* the m/c.

The last time we bled my 914's system, we had installed a completely dry m/c
and front calipers.  We used a combination of vacuum and pumping as follows:

(1) Fill reservoir
(2) create vacuum on closed wheel cylinder bleeder
(3) pump the pedal 5-10 times until pressure is built up at m/c
(4) release wheel cylinder bleeder until pedal hits bottom.
(5) Once we had fluid through (with some bubbles), we reverted back to the
    standard "pedal-pumping" method.

Rgds,
