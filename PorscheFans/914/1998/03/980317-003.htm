Jeff:

Look in your Haynes - no not the ones you're wearing.  :)

Find the cam duration numbers.

Drop a valve cover and measure the duration of your intake and exhaust
valves.  It's probably much more than stock, but this will tell you for
sure.

Open the valve gaps until you get near stock duration.  In the case of
my '73 hiperf, it takes .030".  

Re-assemble it and begin troubleshooting.  You will be able to make the
engine purr at idle, except for the clatter of valves.  Isn't high CO an
indication of too lean?  Not all the oxy is being consumed.
High HC is from too rich, as I understand it.

Once you have it set at stock, then you can re-adjust the valves for a
compromise of loud noise with good idle or quiet valves and maybe
2,000rpm idle.  I run mine at about .015".  I used to set it to .030"
just for the smog check, which it always passed - before SB 42.

Before any of you armchair authorities tell the world that .015 will
ruin the valve train and destroy the engine, this engine has been in a
daily driver for about 8 years now, and has accumulated maybe 100K
miles.  The rings are worn out, but the valve train isn't.

I didn't remember that we had a problem with idle, Jeff, but then I
probably don't remember a lot of things.  They say that memory is the
second thing to go.  Can't remember what's first.

More 914's right now than I care to admit.  
I pick up the Ancona blue '76 from the paint shop today.  It will sure
be a change of pace from commuting in the '15 Model T Speedster, and not
near as much fun.  Anybody wanna' buy a new-looking stock '76?
