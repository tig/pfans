THE SAGA CONTINUES:

Friday: Went during lunch to the Public Safety Bldg downtown, went thru the
metal detectors (didja know the foil on a pack of camels will set those off?)
and got a copy of the incident report. Clearly shows the ticket to Villian
regarding no proof of Insurance, and Following too close. Also shows supected
insurance carrier. Called. Gave Info. He had reported it! They were waiting
for the Police report to find me. Now, they know. Told them of appraisal,
evaluation, status of car, status of rental, MD, etc. Now I wait till Monday.

SHOPPING:
1. Nice 76 Blue 2.0 w/ leaky galley plugs and leaky oil cooler seals. Fairly
stock w/ 4 Fuchs. $3200

2. Trashed 72 1.7 with Dual Webbers. Ugly Yellow duckling. $1300

3. Copper Metallic 75 1.8 w/ Dual Webers. Painted Steel Wheels. New cheapo

Hopefully, I can get a new 914 out of the settlement as least as nice as mine.
