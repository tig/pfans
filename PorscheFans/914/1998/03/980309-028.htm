	There are three lights in the Combination Gauge (the one on the
left in the dash pod).  These are:  Brake warning light (BIG red one up
at the top), oil pressure light (right side of gauge, green in color),
and the alternator light (left side of gauge, red in color).
	When the ignition is on but the motor is not running, the oil
and alternator lights should both be on steady.  If the hand-brake is
pulled up, or the master cylinder switch has been set, the big brake
warning light will flash.  This flashing is in time with the turn sig-
nals and/or hazard lights.  I think they use the same relay.
	If your oil light is on at all when the car is running, TURN IT
OFF NOW!  It *could* mean your car has no oil pressure.  If you catch it
quickly, you just might not need a new engine.
	If your alternator light comes on during driving, then you need
to start troubleshooting your charging system.

	Sounds like a bit of a wiring problem.  Odd stuff like that often
happens when the grounds are bad, so check all of them you can.  Then
start checking the wires and the components.  An electrical diagram will
help--the one in Haynes is about as good as it gets (unfortunately).  You
may be able to photocopy and enlarge it so it's more useful.
