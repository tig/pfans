Hate to say it, but my car is no longer amoung the living. 
I was cruising along Saturday nite along Aurora Ave N. (ex Hwy 99) at 125th
when two cars ahead of me got it in their head to turn left from the center
lane. How I remember it is this:
See the turn signal on car ahead of car ahead turn on yellow square left turn
signal and STOP in the intersection!
Apply brakes so as not to hit car infront of me.
Shoulder check/ mirrors check to right to see if I can move a lane over.
No option but to stop.
Successfullly stop without hitting car in front of me, they have not hit the
stopped car.
WHAM! I am crushed in the rear by a Jeep Wrangler going way to fast and locked
up and sliding.
RESULT: Trunk crunched all the way to about 1/2 back, Bursch trashed,
engine/tranny locked or siezed, front hood arched, front wheel wells
compressed.
VERDICT: Police, insurance reports, out of state drivers with no insurance
cards, AAA towing to ????, NO WHEELS!

None of this was my fault. My car stopped well! Better than a Wrangler with an
idiot behind the wheel. And I gent crunched right after I put the new 10CD and
Kicker speakers in!!!    Why, I oughta......

WANTED: Later yeared 914 with stock FI (if possible) that runs adequate for
daily use. As rust free as can be reasonably expected, appearance not all that
important. Seattle Area. Doesn't need Stereo, Nice steering wheel, shift knob,
alloys.
