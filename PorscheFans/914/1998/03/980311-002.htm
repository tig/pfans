	I hope that the original poster does not mind my re-posting his
article.  I found it very informative and somewhat helpful.  My own problem
was not quite the same as described herein--my ratchet mechanism was not
functioning quite right internally.  I replaced the retractors and belts.
	Warning:  Seatbelts are one of the MOST IMPORTANT pieces of equipment
in your car.  Do not mess with them if you are not ABOLUTELY CONFIDENT in
your ability to get them functioning correctly.  If you start messing with
them, you are quite literally taking your life in your own hands.  If you do
not feel comfortable with this knowledge, then just buy some new seatbelts.
(944 belts supposedly fit with some minor Dremel-izing.  I've seen an arti-
cle around on the Web somwhere, but I forget where.)

>The retractor mechanism consists of a spring to real in the seatbelt when

>acceleration sensor that latches the seat belt when acceleration/deceleration
>is sensed.  In my case, everything worked fine except the acceleration
>sensor.

>The acceleration sensor consists of a pendulum that forces a pawl into the
>real  teeth when it is displaced and any direction (fore/aft or
>side-to-side).  Wear of the bearing surfaces for the belt real over time
>allows the real (with the ratchet teeth attached) to lower into the pawl
>casing the pawl to interfere with rotation of the seat belt real.  The
>pendulum and pawl are mounted on a bracket held in place by two screws.  The
>fix for the problem consists of loosening two screws and lower the assembly
>just enough to allow the pawl to clear the ratchet teeth.   The above
>description may not be real clear but if you open up the mechanism, I think
>it will help.
>
>To fix the problem, first remove the back upholstered panel to get at the
>retractors.  You may be able to make the necessary adjustments without
>removing the retractor from the car but it may be easier with it out.  I
>suggest taking it out so that you can check to make sure that
>acceleration/deceleration is properly detected.
>
>Anyway, with the retractor out, remove the WIDER endcap.  The narrow endcap
>contains the retractor spring.  If you try to remove this one, you have a big
>problem trying to get the spring rewound and stuffed back in the endcap.  I
>know, Iíve done it!
>
>Loosen the two screws holding the pendulum and pawl bracket and move it down
>just enough to clear the ratchet teeth.  With the mechanism held level (as it
>is installed in the car), test the new position by slowly pulling the
>seatbelt out while checking for interference.  When it is working to your
>satisfaction, tilt the assembly  fore and aft to make sure that the when the
>pendulum swings (due to gravity), it causes the pawl to engage with the
>ratchet teeth.
>
>This simple fix make driving my 914 much more enjoyable.  If  you are having
>retractor problems, I hope it helps you.  Remember that the seat belt system
>is a safety device that probably should only be serviced by a qualified
>technician.  The fix described seems to work but there are no guarantees --
>youíre on your own.
