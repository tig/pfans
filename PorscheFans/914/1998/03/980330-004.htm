It's at least a function of the oil you use. Different oils have different
upper temperature limits. 375 is "real hot" though for most oils. I think
Corvairs have a warning light that turns on at about 450-500. 

If this _is_ the case, then a

You'd need a different distributor for that feature.

It's just a vibration sensor, tuned to detect vibrations with a sharp spike,
which would be charatistic of a knock. MSD sells one that fits in a drain
hole. What's making the sound is the hammer-like blow to the piston face
when detonation occurs.

If you have your over-run bypass valve hooked up, it opens under these
conditions, thus drasticly reducing manifold vacuum, thus causing the MPS to
lean the mixture. It is an emissions control device. I think it is designed
to alter the vacuum so much that the fuel shuts off. I also seem to remember
from reading the patents that the ecu infers an engine speed from the f.i.
trigger points (or something).
