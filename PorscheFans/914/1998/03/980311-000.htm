Hi Demick!

Jeff Canaday amplifies:

"   The original plugs, maybe what you still have, are rather stiff
plastic
hemisphers with a narrow slit. The theory was water spray from below
wouldn't find its way through the slit, but water would drain out. As
we
all know, junk easily plugs the plug. I finally forgot to put mine
back
in and have lived happily ever after. What little water does splash
in
dries a lot faster that the standing water that used to be there. My
advice: take em out, treat the area for rust and paint it real well.
Then leave them out.   "

   Only... I can't figure out what you two gentlemen are talking
about.   My car is not so equipped... or if it ever was, it isn't
now! ('74 914 2.0 litre... late '73 production.

   I have the two "drain cups" or "funnels" with hoses that collect
water from the engine lid and direct it out through the engine shelf,
but other than these, I know of no other drains in the engine bay.  
The extreme forward corners are solid; the left came that way, and
the right is now that way because I glassed it in as a repair for a
badly rusted engine shelf.   There was no evidence of a drain hole in
the rusty part before removal.   Any drain hole in this area would
have to let the water run into the inside of the chassis
longitudinals, and then out their drains behind the outer rocker
panels.   
   This doesn't sound like a good idea to me, as any battery acid
collected on the right side would then end up inside the chassis.  
What is more probable to me is that I really just don't understand
where these drains are.   If you could amplify, or even send me
E-mail with a picture attached, that would be cool.

					Thanks,
                                                            Jim T.
