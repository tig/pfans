OH NO!!!

Was it a grinding buzz or a ratling buzz? Either way it's gonna probably
mean dropping the engine. If it was the seal, then maybe a bolt or
something came loose and dropped or pushed into the gap between the fan
and seal (BTDT). If it was the oil pump (though I suspect not) it might
have been the pump gears. And if it was the galley plug, you would have
thoroughly oiled the track and run the engine dry in a very short time. 

Drop the engine and start pulling stuff off. Or, thoroughly clean the
engine and let it sit and drip, then see where the oil comes from.
