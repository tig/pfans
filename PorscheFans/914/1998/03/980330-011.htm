I'm not worried about my oil, I change it very often and run Valvoline
Synthetic (not the durablend crap), so oil isn't my worry. My concern is
for the heads themselves.

That's a given. However, when I do set up this FI system it will most
definately be crank fired anyway, so... "Distributors? We don' need no
steenkin' distributors!".

That's sounds about right, in which case mounting to the case would be
just fine.

This is a big concern of mine, and here's why. You've just been haulin'
around at high revs and your engine (the heads) are now plenty hot, and
now here comes a downhill stretch, you close the throttle and
compression brake on the way down. Now, not only do you have hot heads,
but now you've shut off the fuel going to the engine. So now you have
*cold* air that was drawn through the intake, ready for combustion, only
to be pushed back out while still cold. This cold air goes right out the
exhaust valve, and (yup you guessed it) the valve seat! How do those
valve seats get installed? They're shrunk fit in by heating the head and
cooling the seat untill it's small enough relative to the valve port so
that it fits in and then when they reach equal temperatures, it's held
fast in place. So the problem I see is that you're now shock cooling
this poor little valve seat while it's in the very hot head. Hmm, what
might happen? The poor little valve seat shrinks and falls out! Does
this sound familliar to anyone?

Just a concern of mine...
