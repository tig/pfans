Heck, my teener has developed a bad hesistation from 2000-2200k rpm;
a balk on acceleration, or a buck when crusing in that range.
It's fine once rpms get above 2200.
Does anyone have a suggestion before I start checking everything from scratch? 
Here's the setup (new or checked means less than 6 months):

- Stock 2.0 d-jet, electronic ignition (magnetic), new coil, new trigger points,
  new plug wires, new mps, head temp sensor ok, grounds cleaned/checked
recently,
  injectors tested recently (equal volume, no leaks), fuel pressure @ 30psi,
  all new hoses - checked for vacuum leaks couple of months ago, timing ok,
  plugs have couple thousand miles but look right. I cleaned the TPS and the
  contacts look kinda worn, but unplugging it didn't solve the problem.

Didn't I just do this? Well yeah, it had these same symptoms
when fine rust from the tank would begin clogging the filter - clean filter or
change it and problem went away. Now tank is coated, new filter, and I
checked the filter and is seems clear. Coincidence??
Any advice/suggestions greatly appreciated...

Thanks,
