I got my head back from MSHP and it looks great.  They timeserted the spa=
rkplug holes but you can barely tell.  I had some radial cracking around =
there.  New valves, guides, and new super duper MSHP undroppable valve =
seats.  The head looks great.  Machining always looks pretty.  I am going=
 with the shims and no head gasket.  MSHP suggested going that way.  Anyo=
ne know how much more compression I'd  have if I leave out the shims?  =
(stock FI, euro pistons) too much?

As for the question about the exhaust stud length ,
Hey, I can answer one!  (with ease as the head is sitting on my office =
desk right now)
How about this...

The shortest one sticks out 1 3/8" while the longest one is 1 5/8", the =
other 2 are right at 1 1/2".
MSHP shipped my head without including the .010 cylinder shims or my Inje=
ctor O-rings.  Without the shims I can't stat putting my motor back toget=
her yet.  They said they will ship them out ASAP.

As for sheet metal, I wanted to paint mine yellow too.  The car will be =
done in 3 colors (german flag) with black being on the bottom and tying =
in with the top of the black bumpers, so this fits right in.  When I boxe=
d the swing arms I powder coated one red and the other blue.  Why?  I can=
't say.  But when someone looks at my car now, in it's stock looking form=
, they always notice them and wonder how "setup" this sleeper is.  Troubl=
e is, it's not.  I have done the rear bushings, yellow koni's around, sto=
ck sway bar, 140lb. springs in the rear and that's it.  The 2.0 motor wil=
l be so much better than the 1.7 it replaces.  I want to bump up to 911 =
front suspension with 6x15 Fuchs.  Then I can swap the sticky tires over =
to the 912 and go play in that for a day, or take the 914 out for a trip =
up the coast.
This car, when done will be mostly track only , but I want it street lega=
l to drive every now and then, especially now that it is smog exempt! : =
)
I'll post more when I can start putting this all back together.

Thanks!
