   Uhhh, duhhh, right!   You and dave D. are quite correct.  It is
6000 mile intervals.   I guess another brain cell died while I was
answering that one.

  I doubt seriously that any shop (unless they are Porsche purists
indeed, with comensurate prices) would do even as good a job as
yourself, let alone better.

   Once you have done it a couple of times, you will find that 
A.  you will consider it boring, and a chore, and

consistent, accurate results.

   I have a short-cut procedure for valve adjustment, complete with
