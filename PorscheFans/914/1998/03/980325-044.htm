   The owner's manual states that the break-in period is 620 miles
(well actually, they say 620 mph, but that has to be a translation
problem), which converts to 1000 Km.   I'd avoid RPM in excess of
3000 for that period, making sure to do as Porsche suggests, which is
to vary the speed and load, and not to allow the engine to "lug" or
"labour" as the British would say.  
   You were probably a bit premature on the oil changes and valve
adjustments, but that can't possibly hurt anything... just more time
and money out of your pocket.   Standard practice is to change the
oil at the end of the first break-in period (500 - 600 miles) and
also adjust the valves then, then again at about 1500 miles, and at
3000  mile intervals thereafter.

   There are as many opinions on break-in as there are car owners,
and now that you and I have started this thread, I'm sure that you'll
get some more opinions.

					Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
