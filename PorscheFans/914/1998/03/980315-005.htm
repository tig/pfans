I'm reading a lot of misinformation from the purist among you. Putting a
small block chevy in a 914 only adds about 100-150lbs to the weight. The
stock 914 mill is HEAVY with all the accessories.

I've been around a bunch of v8 and v6 914s and they seem to work out
fine. My biggest quibble with those conversions is the loss of the front
trunk to a radiator.

I think a much more practical swap is the Mazda rotary. I've seen a
couple of those swaps and have noticed that the engine compartment is
practically empty afterwards. My thinking would be to build a dual
radiator setup with one radiator on each side of the engine and judicious
use of thermostatically controlled fans to cool the engine. All of this
would be mounted inside the current engine compartment without cutting
any holes or making any changes to the outside of the car. Perhaps a
914-6 engine cover would have to be used without any drip pans but I
think enough cooling air flow could be sucked thru to cool a rotary. Of
course, good use of sheet metal would be necessary to keep the hot air
from getting back in front of the radiators.

I know there are some on this list who have teeners with rotaries in
them. The reviews I have read are excellent.
