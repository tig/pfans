Maybe Jeffrey has hit on a combination problem that is causing your 
woes... I have never heard using the 17mm w/911 front brakes; this would 
cause a deeper-than-normal pedal, leak or no leak.  If it has a slight 
leak on top off that (maybe in the secondary chamber?) the problem could 
be exacerbated.

Would switch to the 19mm (better unit anyway, for your purposes) and try 
again.
