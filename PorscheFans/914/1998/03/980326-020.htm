At the risk of sounding like a CB Performance rep (I'm not), GEEZ, that's a lot of
money for a air/fuel gauge.  I think the one I bought was about $70 from CBPerf
and it has the ratio numbers and a needle on it (for me that's faster to get a
reading from than a digital number just like it would be for a tach).
