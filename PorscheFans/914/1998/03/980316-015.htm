All using the Fuel Tank Tutorial. 
Append the next 5 lines plus signature to Tutorial.

Frank, good advice. 
If tank had been siphoned as I explained, the fuel that remains will just be
in the hose line which I advised to use a container to catch the remaining
fuel in.

When I did this, it was easily contained into the container without a problem.

Naturally, the disclaimer I wrote was for those who use my tutorial.

It is very disappointing to me that any disclaimer has to be inserted into
any procedure I think others can learn and use.

Very often, someone asks a question about the 914. The general rule is there
will be so many different comments by discussion that the person asking a
question is more confused than they were when questions were asked.
 
Naturally, that is the format of this list and MUST remain so.
 
There needs to be dedicated information which does not include distractions.
I call them TUTORIALS. Comments which advice corrections are not distractions.

Your comment is worthy of inclusion and I recommend that anyone using the
FUEL TANK TUTORIAL to append your comment to my original post.

Thanks.
