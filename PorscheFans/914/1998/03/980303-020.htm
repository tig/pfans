The exhaust studs in my motor were not threaded all the way to the bottom,
so they must rely on the tightness of the threads for retention. There are
different classes of fit for threads, I think, and my experience with the
other studs in the motor and transmission are that they are "tight", no
wobble at all. I'll have to do some research to find out for sure.
