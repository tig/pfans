Hi Dave!

  You wrote (re rotors):

   Now I understand what you are driving at... this can be determined
easily by simply looking at the top of the rotor.   If you look at
the left-hand photograph of the rotor (non-rev-limiting) on page 63
of the Haynes book, you will notice a bright brass area near the
center of the rotor, then a dull area (which, on my Bosch rotor, is
black epoxy), followed by a bright brass tip.   The black epoxy is
used to "pot" the resistor, i.e. keep it firmly attached to the rotor
at high speed.   A cheapie after-market rotor without the resistor
will usually have an exposed metal bar that can be seen to run all
the way from the rotor center to the tip.

  If you are still not sure, an ohm meter measurement between the
center and the tip will remove all doubt.   My rotor measures 4.88K
ohms, which means that the resistor is probably a 4.7K (standard
value).  Anything within 20% of this should be just fine.   Of
course, 0 ohms means that there is no resistor, just a straight metal
contact.

   As far as rev-limiting style rotors go, I believe that these are a
Bosch-only item, and they all have the resistor.   You have to
examine the mechanism closely to guess where it is, but as I recall,
it's tell-tale potted groove is there somewhere.  It too should
measure about the same value with an ohm meter.

					Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
