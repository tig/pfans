That certainly bears looking into, thanks Andy. Anyone got a D-jet
tester lying around? :)

So I've learned. Like I said, it was just a guess. So it's rapid leaning
out at higher head temps is a 'feature' in the design and not deliberate
then.

Now that makes alot of sense, unfortuantely it also seems to make it a
bit more complex of a design. I guess a transducer and a notch filter
are the basic components. It's the determination of what constitutes a
'knock' on a given engine.

Except the cooling of the exhaust seats...

That's not a particular concern of mine, but it makes sense...

That's what I had figured, but I'm glad I head it from someone else.

Oh well, the little sacrifices we all make in the name of performance...
