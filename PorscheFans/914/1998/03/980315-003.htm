Hay guys.............There's a guy named Mike Perpall lurking out there that
is finishing his conversion.  He is in Norcross, GA and is the owner of
several 914s. His conversion is a Vortec based project not a Buick V-6.  I
think he has worked out some of the issues you guys are tossing around. Give
him a shout, maybe he can help? (Dr Perp@aol.com)

- Another vote for Porsche power.

Here is another note on which way to go (911/6, V6, V8 ect..).
I was involved in a accident this past year.  It wasn't bad enough to total
the car but it was close.
I had the pleasure (NOT) to deal with a major, well respected insurance
company other than my personal insurer.  I was reare ended by a speeding
driver that was distracted (chasing someone else).  It was a learning
experience that I hope none of you have to go through.  
If I wouldn't have had the ability to stuff documentation down thier throats
in mass quantities the value of the car would have been in the "Nice Pacer"
range and that would have surely totalled it.
Validation for USAA required involvement from PCA's evalauation group, several
pages of market summaries on the 914's value, all receipts for my conversion,
statements from three very knowledgeable vinatge car reseller, a private
professional appraisal ($500.00 of my money), two visits to legal council
(more $$$), detailed pictures and a significant amout of grief.  It was a
tough 10 month ordeal.     
My point is there is probably not that kind of info. available on the
alternate powerplant conversion cars.  You can certainly show documentation on
what you spent on the car but as all insurance companies will tell you "Your
invested amount may not equal or exceed the cars fail market value."  The
insurance evaluation will be based on the FMV and the appraisal done by one of
their employees.  Their estimate of my 914 was almost $10K off of the
independant appraisal.  So don't count on that alone to secure your roadsters
future.
This may be more consideration for which way you should go on your conversion.
