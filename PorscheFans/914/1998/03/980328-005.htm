For J. J. Slowik;  cc Porschefans-914

Hi J.J. !

You asked:

copy of

   Sure... reproduction of Porsche '74 owner's handbook follows.  It
is as close as possible to the original text.

  Here goes:

BREAKING IN ENGINE

There are no special rules for breaking in your
Porsche Type 914, however the following
hints are worth observing in order to obtain the
optimum running characteristics from the
engine. In spite of the high precision of mo-
dern assembly methods, the movable parts of
the engine can only be broken in fully during
the initial hours of operation.  This process
takes place essentially during the first
620 mph (sic), therefore:

Vary the rpm and the load put on the whole
power unit.

Moreover:  never run the engine at a high rpm
when it is cold or in neutral, always shift down
in plenty of time and don't torture the engine
unnecessarily on hills, in other words, always
use the most favorable rpm range.


end Porsche text.

   My own $.02 worth says that field assembly methods and tolerances
are not as good as those of the factory, and therefore I limit the
revs for the first 500 - 600 miles to no more than 3000 RPM.   Also,
I never use full throttle.  And finally, I observe the practice of
never allowing the engine to run at a steady speed during the break
in period;  I am always either accelerating or decelerating (see the
reference to varying the rpm and load above).   This usually tends to
annoy people following me!

   Anyway, you now have the factory opinion, and mine... good luck!

					Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
