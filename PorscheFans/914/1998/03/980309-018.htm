	>Diary of a Snow Shoveler
	>
	>December 6: 6:00 PM. It started to snow. The first snow of the
season
	>and the wife and I took our cocktails and sat for hours by the
window
	>watching the huge soft flakes drift down from heaven.  It
looked like
	>a Grandma Moses Print.  So romantic we felt like newlyweds
again.  I
	>love snow!
	>
	>December 7: We woke to a beautiful blanket of crystal white
snow
	>covering every inch of the landscape. What a fantastic sight!
Can
	>there be a more lovely place in the Whole World? Moving here
was the
	>best idea I've ever had. Shoveled for the first time in years
and felt
	>like a boy again. I did both our driveway and the sidewalks.
This
	>afternoon the snowplow came along and covered up the sidewalks
and
	>closed in the driveway, so I got to shovel again.  What a
perfect
	>life.
	>
	>December 12: The sun has melted all our lovely snow. Such a
	>disappointment.  My neighbor tells me not to worry, we'll
definitely
	>have a white Christmas.  No snow on Christmas would be awful!
Bob
	>says we'll have so much snow by the end of winter, that I'll
never
	>want to see snow again.  l don't think that's possible.  Bob is
such a
	>nice man. I'm glad he's our neighbor.
	>
	>December 14: Snow lovely snow!  8" last night. The temperature
dropped
	>to -20.  The cold makes everything sparkle so. The wind took my
breath
	>away, but I warmed up by shoveling the driveway and sidewalks.
This is
	>the life!  The snowplow came back this afternoon and buried
everything
	>again. l didn't realize I would have to do quite this much
shoveling,
	>but I'll certainly get back in shape this way.
	>
	>December 15: 20 inches forecast.  Sold my van and bought a 4x4
Blazer.
	>Bought snow tires for the wife's car and 2 extra shovels.
Stocked the
	>freezer. The wife wants a wood stove in case the electricity
goes out.
	>I think that's silly.  We aren't in Alaska, after all.
	>
	>December 16: Ice storm this morning. Fell on my ass on the ice
in the
	>driveway putting down salt. Hurt like hell. The wife laughed
for an
	>hour, which I think was very cruel.
	>
	>December 17: Still way below freezing.  Roads are too icy to go
	>anywhere. Electricity was off for 5 hours. I had to pile the
blankets
	>on to stay warm.  Nothing to do but stare at the wife and try
not to
	>irritate her.  Guess I should've bought a wood stove, but won't
admit
	>it to her. I hate it when she's right.  I can't believe I'm
freezing
	>to death in my own living room.
	>
	>December 20: Electricity's back on, but had another 14" of the
damn
	>stuff last night.  More shoveling. Took all day.  Dam snowplow
came by
	>twice.  Tried to find a neighbor kid to shovel, but they said
they're
	>too busy playing hockey.  I think they're lying.  Called the
only
	>hardware store around to see about buying a snow blower and
they're
	>out.  Might have another shipment in March.  I think they're
lying.
	>Bob says I have to shovel or the city will have it done and
bill me.
	>I think he's lying.
	>
	>December 22: Bob was right about a white Christmas because 13
more
	>inches of the white shit fell today, and it's so cold it
probably
	>won't melt till August. Took me 45 minutes to get all dressed
up to go
	>out to shovel and then I had to urinate. By the time I got
undressed,
	>urinated and dressed again. I was too tired to shovel. Tried to
hire
	>Bob who has a plow on his truck for the rest of the winter; but
he
	>says he's too busy. I think the asshole is lying.
	>
	>December 23: Only 2" of snow today.  And it warmed up to 0. The
wife
	>wanted me to decorate the front of the house this morning. What
is she
	>nuts!!!  Why didn't she tell me to do that a month ago? She
says she
	>did but I think she's lying.
	>
	>December 24: 6".  Snow packed so hard by snowplow, l broke the
shovel.
	>Thought I was having a heart attack. If I ever catch the son of
a
	>bitch who drives that snowplow, I'll drag him through the snow
by his
	>balls. I know he hides around the corner and waits for me to
finish
	>shoveling and then he comes down the street at a 100 miles an
hour and
	>throws snow all over where I've just been! Tonight the wife
wanted me
	>to sing Christmas carols with her and open our presents, but I
was
	>busy watching for the dam snowplow.
	>
	>December 25: Merry Christmas.  20 more inches of the
!=3D@x@!x!x1 slop
	>tonight.  Snowed in.  The idea of shoveling makes my blood
boil.  I
	>hate the snow!  Then the snowplow driver came by asking for a
donation
	>and I hit him over the head with my shovel.  The wife says I
have a
	>bad attitude.  I think she's an idiot.  If I have to watch
"It's a
	>Wonderful Life" one more time, I'm going to kill her.
	>
	>December 26: Still snowed in.  Why the hell did I ever move
here?  It
	>was all HER idea.  She's really getting on my nerves.
	>
	>December 27:  Temperature dropped to -30 and the pipes froze.
	>
	>December 28: Warmed up to above -20.  Still snowed in.  She is
driving
	>me crazy!!!!!
	>
	>December 29: 10 more inches.  Bob says I have to shovel the
roof or it
	>could cave in.  That's the silliest thing I ever heard.  How
dumb does
	>he think I am?
	>
	>December 30: Roof caved in.  The snow plow driver is suing me
for a
	>million dollars.  The wife went home to her mother.  9 inches
	>predicted.
	>
	>December 31:  Set fire to what's left of the house.  No more
shoveling.
	>
	>January 8: I feel so good.  I just love those little white
pills they
	>keep giving me. Why am I tied to the bed?
	>
