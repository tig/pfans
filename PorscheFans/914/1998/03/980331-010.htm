My understanding (and it's not terribly thorough) is that while the 2
wire has a greater dynamic range, the 3 wire (heated) has better
resolution and response time. I think it's the latter (response time)
that makes them preferable for perfomance type tuning.

I believe that both 3 and 2 wire sensors have a 1.0V output range and
that 0.5V is approximately stoichiometric. I need to emphasize
-approximately-. Your general $60 O2 sensor is not calibrated very
precisely at all. So the 0-1V range is relative, not absolute.

It doesn't matter terribly much, and if you intend on using a single
intake port (throttle body or single carb) then it probably doesn't
matter where in the exhaust system it goes. But my preference is to
mount it somewhere where it's seeing all four (or six or eight or
whatever) cylinders. Rather than just monitoring one and hoping the rest
are doing the same thing. I had it mounted in the Bursch collector just
upstream of the muffler so I could monitor all four as a whole. I intend
on going to four independent throttle bodies, and would hate for one
cylinder to be way off the rest and use that cylinder for the basis of
my measurements.

But I would recomend against putting it too close to the exhaust port,
it's not neccessary. EGT, yes, right next to the head, but O2 can be
further downstream if needed.

I'll measure it, but not much.

Yup. My gauge is a digital voltmeter with a 1V range. I prefer actuall
numbers over just an LED bargraph. A quick glimpse and I can see the
first digit and know if I'm ok. A little more, and I'll read the second
digit and see on what side of 0.5 or 0.6 it is.

I'll forward your questions to my friend who's developing these systems.
