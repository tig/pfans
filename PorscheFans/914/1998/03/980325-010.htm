My 2.0 motor has been out of the car and partially disassembled for about a
year now. I need a valve job, which I haven't gotten around to yet. My
questions are about the cylinders though.

The jugs appear to be like new. The honing scratches are still plainly
visible and there is absolutley no lip in the bore. The pistons only have a
light dusting of carbon on them, so it appears that this set has very low
miles on them. The fins are rusty, though. When I checked compression before
I took the motor out, all 4 cylinders were about 135psi. I want to "upgrade"
my cylinders by having the bores coated with nodular, thin dense chrome
(armoloy), and I want to plate the outsides with something like zinc
chromate. This would mean I would need new rings, of course. Are soft iron
rings available for this motor? I've heard that they are best for chromed
bores. Should I re-hone the bores if the old hash marks are still there and
the NTDC coating is somewhat rough anyway? (the Armoloy coating has a
roughness value of 8rms, which appears as a matte finish. This is an
industrial chrome finish, not that "pretty" chrome you see on trim.) I'm
torn between "leave it alone" and "make it better". I think I've worked out
the order in which I would have the work done, but I'm not exactly sure. I
think I would have the Armoloy done to the bores first, then mask off the
bores and have the fins blasted and plated. I'm looking for some educated,
experienced opinions on this, please.
