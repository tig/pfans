NO, the dealer told me Amsoil had a phenomenon of swelling gaskets.  
It usually reduced/prevented leaking.  In the case of the 914, it
had quite the opposite effect.  The first pair of cork gaskets had been
in place for untold months and miles without problem.  Overnight they
swelled and pulled away, forming an inverted U in the two spots where
oil sits.

I have been driving and fixing my own aircooled Porsche and VW (and
aircraft) engines longer than most of you have been alive, and this is
the only time I seen this.

I have been running Mobil 1 in the family sedan for the last 115,000 of
its 130K miles, but have been afraid to try it in any of my 914 due to
the experience above.

More 914's right now than I care to admit.
