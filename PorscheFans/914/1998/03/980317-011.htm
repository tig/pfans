Well everyone, I just closed the deal on a 1969 911 ( a real nice restored 
one, with a 1974 2.7liter engine, and a complete turbo-look makeover). But, 
since we live in a less than ideal world, I'm afraid I can't afford both 
the 911 and my 914.  So, I'm putting the 914 up for sale.  Its a 1974, with 
a 1.8L engine.  The engine was rebuilt to stock about 3 years ago, and 
still runs great.  The only rust on the car is a little bubbling on the 
rear edge of the rear trunk, and some bubbling at the base of the roof 
pillar (underneath the vinyl), but the rest of the chassis/body is 
rust-free.   The car was professionally repainted red with black rockers at 
the same time the engine was rebuilt, and, except for the mentioned 
bubbling, still looks good.  The interior is in good condition, the seats 
have several small rips, and the dash is cracked, but other than that, it 
looks good.  The car has the center console with gauges, although the clock 
isn't working, and also has a CD player installed. I just put new tires 
(stock size) on it a couple of months ago.  I am asking $3500.00/OBO.

This is a really nice car to drive or to start a restoration on.  If 
anybody wants more information or a picture (scanned), I can be contacted
