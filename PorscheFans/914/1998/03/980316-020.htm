Brian and ALL others,

Good to have alternative methods. Very well written and to the point.
Thanks for showing that there is other, but clearly written ways, to do
anything related to our 914 repairs.

How about some tutorials we and others could use, but written as a dedicated
tutorial such as seat and back uphostelery recovering, making a center
console, installing new rubber (generalize each area as a separate
tutorial), installing a clutch cable, speedometer cable, replacing emergency
brake handle and lines, bumper replacement, engine lid torsion spring
removal and replacement, ignition switch changing, paint color codes chart, etc.
 
Many out on the list need these to show it is not hard to do if they have
simple to follow methods. I stress the fact that all who have 914's are not
mechanics in the lowest term of that word. Let's help them to get the simple
things there in front of them by simple DEDICATED instructional tutorials.
Each as a separate tutorial. Yes. I know that these are in the manuals, but
1st hand experience tutorials are BETTER than ANY manual will ever be.

This is OUR 914 list so lets keep it that way by helping users of OUR list.
The other sites are great to visit, but this one is OURS and we don't need
to forget that some members of the list are e-mail connections ONLY.

Yes, I realize my posts are numerous today. Fixed the damn monitor myself
and will be posting whats on my mind the same as all the rest who post
frequently.
Tutorial comments are always welcome, pro or con. Always append all comments
that are corrections to any post.

To EVERYONE reading this.

Anyone working on anything, needs to understand that they alone are
responsible for their own safety. Common sense is their own responsibility.
If they have no common sense, they should hire ALL to be done and not
attempt to do anything which, if they do it wrong, they want to blame others
for their own mistakes.
