Quick question.  I'm putting an O2 sensor in my exhaust to use to check the
air-fuel ratio.  Since it is so far from the heads I decided to get a three
wire sensor.  Got a Bosch unit (#13950 I think, don't have it at work with
me).  It had no wiring diagram with it.  It has 2 white wires and one black
wire.  I get 3.5 ohms across the white wires.  Open circuit across the
black and either white.

So I'm assuming the two white wires are the heater, one to 12v and one to
ground.  The black wire is for the sensor.

Can anyone confirm this?  I'd like to make sure before I wire it up
completely.


Never enough time on the weekends.  I did check the wiring and hope I've
solved the problems I had.  Found that the plug for the MPS had been worked
on before.  Several  wires had broken strands.  All had been soldered and
at least one had a cold solder joint and was only held in by mechanical
pressure on the plastic plug.  The Lisle Terminal tool works fairly well
for removing the terminals, takes a certain feel to get them out but after
a few it was easier.  Since you have to still pull on the wire to get the
terminal out it is a good test for the wire connection strength.

I repaired and soldered all four MPS plug connections again.  This should
hold till I can get new connectors from the source Dave D. has posted.
Found a broken wire on the Temp 1 sensor and fixed it.  Put new rubber
boots on the MPS plug, one of the injectors connections and the Temp 1
plug.

Checked the cold start valve, it doesn't leak under pressure, sprays
nicely.  Hooked it up.  Figured out what a wire near the coil bundle was
for, Ralph R. and I weren't sure when reinstalling my FI system.  It is for
the thermo time switch.  It had been patched but was too short to actually
reach the thermo time switch.  We were running out of time and hadn't tried
to hook up the cold start valve then.  I discovered the thermo time switch
is dead ( it is open circuit at 70 deg.  stuck it in freezer for an hour,
still open circuit)  so I temporarily bypassed it directly to ground so the
cold start valve will always fire.

Checked the fuel pressure with FI gauge set I got from JCWhitney.  Don't
know it's accuracy though.  It shows running pressure at 31psi, but Ralph
had set it with his gauge that he knew accuracy of so I'll leave it (
Ralph, do you usually set for a particular PSI, or happen to recall?  I
know it was about 8 months ago, just trying to get an idea on this gauge I
have).  The fuel pump check valve seems to work.  When shut off it holds at
about 20psi then very slowly drops, still had 5psi the next morning.

After checking/fixing this stuff the car started right up.  Didn't do a CO
check since I still hoped to take a drive but first wanted to mount the O2.
Pulled the Bursch exhaust and drilled a hole, modified the HELP brand anti
fouler plug holder to use as a bung for the O2.  Discovered I need more
practice at brazing and that the old flux coated rod I had wasn't much
good.  Clean up mess, run to store for can of brazing flux, more brazing.
Just enough time to clean up and spray some paint on the exhaust/bung spot.
If I'm lucky I'll get the exhaust mounted back on tonight.  But then three
days of rain coming and next 2 weekends out of town so back under the tarps
it goes.  I want to drive.....

Still have to fix the leaks in the tranny, new o-rings for the speedo drive
and the side shifter plate.

Really looking forward to about three weeks from now when the time changes
so more light in evenings, hopefully the rain is over, and then in about a
month I get the garage to myself so will have more work space and can leave
tools, welder, etc. out from one day to the next.
