	They kept the D-jet for the 2.0 (I'm convinced) for one reason:
Money.  They already had the 2.0 D-jet done, and it worked well enough to
meet all the legal requirements.  Why spend money on using a different fuel
system when what you have works?
	I think they used the L-jet on the 1.8 because they needed to do
some modifications to get the system to work with a higher-displacement
motor, so they might as well go to Bosch's newest brain-child.  Not only is
the load measurement more accurate, but the L-jet system is supposed to be
simpler and more robust.  (Unfortunately, it's more suceptible to backfires
than the D-jet.)
	Notice how the air-cooled VWs all moved to L-jet (or some variation)
after about 75 or so?  The better accuracy of that system was needed to get
emissions down low enough.

	And, of course, most modern fuel systems are based on the L-jet FI
of the 1.8-liter 914.  First in the world, wave of the future!
