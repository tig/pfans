Ok Ben! Now that goes along with my suggestion of the same. I already made
the same recomendation a while back.

Ultimately there are some subtle differences. And those differences could
amount to maybe 100# weight savings. Thinking about the lack of side impact
door beams, different window winder mechanisms, and a non-movable passenger
seat could probably save a moderate amount of weight.

Yup, but it's not exactly -no- headers. It's just that the heater hardware
(any of it!) cannot be modified to accomodate tuned headers or anything
else for that matter.

Consolodation of the 914 could still allow a DSP move as an X1/9
consolodation (along with it) actually yields quite a noticable benefit for
the italian imitation <vbg>. The 1300cc X1/9 has a 4.43 final drive and the
1500cc X1/9 has a 4.11 final drive (I think), and this could help even out
the balance a little. But the 914s have noticeably more torque and are
capable of running larger diameter wheels and tires that the X1/9. So,
while _I_ personally feel that the smaller 914s should be moved to DSP, I'm
hesitant to think that the SPAC will. But we should all keep pushing it
anyway.

It's not unheard of, to split the cars between classes, but the
displacement of the 1.8 is a pretty big edge over the 1.5L X1/9 (with or
without 4.43 final drive). I will still be pushing for a DSP move, but
untill that day, I'll be doing my darndest to make the most kick-ass 914
possible under the current SP rules. But in CSP, it's a tough crowd.
