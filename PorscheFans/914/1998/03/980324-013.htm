	Compression (as read on a gauge) has lots of variables.
You might see 150# or more, at sea level with a stock motor.
But a cam with more overlap would tend to lower the pressure, as
would being at a higher altitude.  Other things also play a role.
If you're down below 100#, it's not a good sign.
	Cold vs. warm also makes a real difference, and most
numbers that get thrown around are for warm engines.

	It's possible.  Try putting a pot in where the sensor
would be.  0-3K ohms or so, one end of it hooked to the wiring
harness, the other end to ground.  About 2500-3K ohms for star-
ting.
	Have you checked to see if you have a decent spark yet?
	See my previous notes for ideas on timing.
