First off, there is the engine builders moto: 

"Speed is just a question of money. How fast can you afford to go?"

Anything that one would reasonably call a 'monster' will probably cost
you plenty of money. There is really not a whole lot you can do with a
stock 2.0L engine to make that "gobs o' power" thing you seem to want.
So what you will wind up doing in search for power is either doing some
serious (and expensive) engine work to your 2.0L motor, buying a built
race motor (neither of which will last very long), or dropping in an
engine from some other creature (conversion).

Now, if you're just looking for some modest power gains, there are a few
things you can do. Bursch exhaust or tuned headers and larger bore
throttle body, these are relatively cheap, can be done with the engine
in the car and are worth a couple of horsies. After that, then you're
looking at larger costs. Custom FI or engine work, ranging from just
euro pistons to cams, radical head work, big bore P&Cs, storked crank
and other wild stuff, will yield more power at a notably higher cost.
