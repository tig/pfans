Hi all, Well my 914 is in hundreds of pieces now. Trying to figure out just
how I'm going to get it all back together in time for the East Coast Ramble!!
So this weekend I removed the front suspension, I disassembled, cleaned and
painted the whole assembly. Looks great!! Anyway I did not pay attention when
I removed my torsion bars. I know that there is a left and a right. The bars
are clearly marked. My questions are: I consider the passenger side of the car
to be the right side, drivers side left. Is this correct. Second, I believe
that the stamped letters on the torsion bars were located at the end with the
adjusters. Is this correct?? I do not want to put them in wrong.

Thanks,
Ed Villela
