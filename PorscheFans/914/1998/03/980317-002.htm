Sure. It is a transformer with variable coupling between the input and
output. The thin copper foil diaphram moves a soft iron slug in response to
vacuum. The inductive coupling between the coils is thus changed. The
response characteristics of the MPS is tailored to each specific application
by varying the return spring tension and possibly other things. As I recall
from the patents, the transformer is part of the RLC pulse shaping and
forming network for the bistable multivibrator in the ECU box. On the other
hand, the temp sensors are variable resistors which are also part of this
network. These things are in a feedback network for the multivibrator, as I
recall. So, this system is an analog pulse generator with variable pulse
width. The pulse width being a function of temperature, vacuum, and throttle
position. Also, the pulses are most likely not straight up square waves, but
"shaped" waves with the leading edge of the pulse peaked. This peaking was
used to ensure that the pintle of the injector was popped off of it's seat
at the start of it's "on" cycle.
