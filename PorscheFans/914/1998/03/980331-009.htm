I'm interested in homebrewing an oxy sensor setup. Based on what has been
discussed so far, it seems like a fairly simple thing to build. I have
several questions.

What's the difference between 3 wire and 2 wire sensors in terms of voltage
output range and accuracy? I know that the 3 wire ones are heated and the 2
wire ones are not. I think Josh said that the 3 wire sensor has a 1 volt
range, is that the same as the 2 wire sensor? He also said that 0.5 volt was
stoichiometric, is that also true of the other type of sensor?

How close do the 2 wire ones have to be mounted to the exhaust port? Does it
matter very much? How much current does the heater for the 3 wire sensor draw?

Since the output of these things is a voltage, it seems to me a simple
matter of installing a small, panel mount analog voltmeter with a 1 volt
range. Can the oxy sensor be of any brand? Is there a certain part number
and brand that works best for mounting in an exhaust pipe? Where do I get
the weld on bungs to mount the thing?

Any help would be appreciated.
