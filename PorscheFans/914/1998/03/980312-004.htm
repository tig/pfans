I tried for a couple of days to get this posted, but my mail was returned
unsent due to problems with the list---

There have been several interchanges among members over the last several days
about compression ratio calculations, and what measurements are required.  I
wrote an article on this subject which appeared in the October issue (1997) of
Porsche Panorama magazine which I suspect most members of the list are
familiar with (the magazine, not necessarily the article).  This article
explains what is required to do the measurements, and a simplified method to
make the calculation.  

If there are questions about the method, please email me and I will provide
more info.  As one of the other members did, I had also used a spread sheet
(also in Excel) to generate some graphs which were useful in determining what
effect variations on things like combustion chamber volumes, etc had on the
end number.
