Hi Mike!

You wrote:

"  So now the next thing is to do a cc check on the heads.
Having never done this, I imagine you level the heads and slowly fill
with (water?).  I have syringes that I can mesure pretty accurately
with but what do you do about the surface tension of the water?  Just
get them all somewhat equal?  Would salad oil have less surface
tension?  Just a thought.   "

  Here is an excerpt from my files on this procedure... however,
J.J.'s method using plexiglass is the most precise.   I'd still use
water; it cleans up easier, and you want a liquid without any
affinity for the metal so that you can get more accurate repeat
measurements, if necessary.

Excerpt:
Because of the surface tension of the water, and the non-afinity of
aluminum for
water, you will have to scrub the syringe plastic nose around the
edge of the chamber to wet it, and be careful not to overfill, so
that the water runs out onto the flat part.  If you do, dump out the
water, dry the combustion chamber with a 
paper towel, and start over.  It is best to do all four, and mark on
the adjacent 
cooling fins the measured capacity of the chamber.  After having new
guides installed and the existing valves and seats ground (which
should have INCREASED the chamber volume, as the valves are now lower
in the head) my combustion chambers measured 60 cc's even, all four
of them.  So MEASURE!  Don't 
forget to dry thoroughly and spray in a liberal amount of WD-40 when
you are 
done... rusty valves and seats are not good.



 "  And yes Jim, if you have the time, I'll send you my numbers and
that way the group can see the results.

What numbers exactley do you need?  "

  Here's what is necessary in the way of raw data:

1.  Desired Compression Ratio:  This is the C/R that you want to end
up with when 				you are all done.
2.  Piston Dish Volume:   This is the volume of the dish in the top
of your pistons; it 				is measured in the same way as the combustion
				chamber volume.
3.  Combustion Chamber Volume:   This is the result from "CC-ing" the
heads.

4.  Deck Height (Measured in Inches):   This is (as I'm sure you
already know, as
					you mentioned a measurement) the 
					clearance between the piston tops and
					the top edge of the cylinder.  Note: to
					get an accurate value for this 					measurement, it will be
necessary to
					hold the cylinders to the engine case
					with retainers.

5.  Head Gasket Thickness (Measured in Inches): This is the
micrometer
						thickness of the head gasket
						rings, if you decide to use them.
						If you are going to leave them
						out, use zero for this value.

6.  Your Engine's Bore (In mm):  	This is self-explanatory; I have
changed the
				spread sheet to handle any engine, including
				over-bores and stroker cranks, so instead
				of asking for the book cc's and dividing by 4,
				I calculate the actual values.

7.  Your Engine's Stroke (In mm): 	Same note as above.


   With the above data, I will return to you a shim thickness in mm
and inches to reduce your compression from it's maximum possible
value to your desired value.  If you are curious, I will also include
the compression as it would be without any shims.  Heck, I will
attach the whole works if you want; but I don't know how big it will
be when "pasted" into a letter.

   The program calculates shim thickness based on the above 7
criteria for a SINGLE cylinder.   If there are vaiations in the
combustion chamber volumes, or in any of the other fixed volumes
between cylinders,  then you have two choices.   

1.  You can average the values, do the calculations once, and buy
only one set of shims from MSHP or whoever.

2.   You can supply seperate values for all four cylinders,  do the
calculations four times,  buy four sets of shims, and thereby custom
tailor the compression in each cylinder.

   Because the shims come stock in standard values, and you have to
go with the closest standard size to the value the program spits out,
the average method is usually good enough.   The exception would be
if you are trying to use salvaged heads,  or some such thing, where
the combustion chamber volumes vary widely.
Doesn't matter to me;  now that I have updated the spreadsheet, I can
plug in any numbers at all, and get the results in seconds, so feel
free to send me several sets of data.   The most interesting results
come from just playing with the numbers though... you can do
"what-if's".  For example, what if I left the head gaskets out?  Or,
what if I used flat-topped pistons?  Or what if I took 5 cc off the
combustion chambers by fly-cutting?

   I will try to do as many of these as I can for you, but obviously,
I can't run 10 or 20 simulations for everyone on the list!   No
Time!!   The best bet for everyone is to come up with your own
spread-sheet software... I will give the actual spread sheet to
anyone who wants to play with it... just E-mail me with your
requests.   It is about 6K bytes.

					Good Luck,
                                                            Jim T.
