I am in the process of restoring a '72 914 with a '74 2.0 with FI.  The
car was stored for many years and I have finally got it to where I can
drive it whenever I want without worrying that I might not return!
Overall, I am very pleased with my new, relatively rust free
acquisition.

Anyway, the FI does have an annoying tendency to change its idle speed
depending on weather, mood, etc.  The cold start idle is good and it
will run for several minutes at a correct high idle.  After this it will
drop down to less than 1000 rpm to the point where it is barely running
and sounding a bit like one of my cammed Chevys.  After running it until
it gets good and warm, the idle will go back up to between 1200 and 1800
rpms.  It will do this consistently even if I screw the idle adjust on
the throttle body all of the way in (sounds like a vacuum leak).

I have replaced all of the hoses in the system to preclude any vacuum
leaks.  The aux air valve seems to be functioning too.  I can pull all
of the lines off of the air cleaner one by one and plug them and see no
difference in the idle.

Any ideas?
