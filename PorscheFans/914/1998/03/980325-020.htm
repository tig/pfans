That sounds good, but is it available in brush-on form? If you've ever tried
to spray parts that have deep grooves, like the fins on cylinders, you'll
find yourself very frustrated at trying to get the paint deep down into the
bottom of each fin. Hence the Hooverism on using a cut (thinned) brush. 

I'm ahving second thoughts on electro-plating cylinders anyway. I just
remembered that electro-plating suffers from the same farady cage effect
that powder coating does. If the cylinder were to by electro-plated, more
metal would collect on the ends of the fins than at the bottom. I'm thinking
now that brush-on painting is the only way to go. 

Just for interest, in the old days when piston aircraft were more common,
one big company (Wright? I can't remember), would spin the cylinder about
it's longitudinal axis immediately after painting to let the excess paint
fly off. They used a green laquer paint, I think for the cylinders of thier
radial motors. Maybe that busted salad spinner could come in handy afterall <g>.
