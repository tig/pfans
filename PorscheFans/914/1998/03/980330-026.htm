Dudes:

I'm cleaning out the garage... These itenms will be thrown out
Thursday night unless someone drives by and takes them away:

    Two stock 914 seats (black):  One is in ok condition, except for
    tears in the seat-cushion seams; the other is in really poor
    condition.  Both are mechanically sound; the "ok" one just needs
    new vinyl, and the other one needs new foam and vinyl. No
    mounting brackets.

    One 914 seat-mounting bracket:  This is the bracket that attaches
    to the seat, not the car.  The adjuster-handle has -- as they
    always do -- broken off. 

    One 914 windshield-washer tank with cap and hose.

    Two stock 914-4 torsion bars.

    Two 914-4 axles with CV joints.  One CV joint is broken; the
    rest are (presumably) ok.

    Two 16" Tripledge windshield wipers.  These wipers DON'T fit the
    914.  New, never been used.

    One 914-4 steel wheel, with 165R15 Sears Road Handler tire.

    Whatever other 914 parts I find as I continue digging through
    the crap in my garage.

In my opinion, none of this stuff is worth shipping, so I'm looking
for someone local to take it off my hands... I'm about thirty miles
north of San Diego, California.

If you're interested, let me know in private email.
