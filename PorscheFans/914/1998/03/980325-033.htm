    My 73 has turn indicators the flicker if I'm lucky. Most of the time they stay
on.  I wouldn't mind this so much but the buzzer also sounds.  If I use the blinkers
the problem stops.

    I'm too young to drive around with my left blinker on all the time. 

   The previous owner did replace the turn signals.  Which part I don't know?  The
relay I guess. Is is possible that he replaced some parts with a later year that
might result in this problem? 

   Someone also mentioned to me that there are some resistors behind the insturment
panel the could also be the root of my problem.  

    Any input would be great I'm tired of turning the radio up to drown out the noise.

Thanks
