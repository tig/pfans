There are 3 classes of threads: Class 1 (A is external and B internal)
is the loosest fit used for ease of assembly; Class 2(A or B) is normal
commercial grade where interchangeability is still important; and Class
3(A or B) used in places where exceptionally high-grade commercial
products require very close fits (ie parts of a milling machine or jig
assembly for same).

I doubt very much that Porsche used a Class 3 thread on the exhaust
studs/holes.  The expansion and contraction of the head and stud would
make that just plain silly.  The hole may have a special size though to
allow for expansion and contraction.  

The stud probably didn't go to the bottom of the hole because it is very
hard (read costly) to actually thread a hole all the way to the bottom.
The stud may be held by being forced into the last few unfinished
threads (this doesn't allow the bolt/stud to touch bottom).  This
doesn't happen with the Timeserts because they are pre-formed,
pre-threaded holes.  I don't think they should be noticeably "loose"
though.  Not more than a regular nut, anyway. 

Hope this sheds some more light on the subject . . .
