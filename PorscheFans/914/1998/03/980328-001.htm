the more things change.. the more they remain the same..

my bible has been Stockel's automechanics fundamentals for many yrs:

stockel says the "head" (ring area) is 030 to 040 smaller than the
nominal bore size cuz it is subject to +/- 600 F temps & needs to expand

the skirt & slipper area( 90 degrees to pin) are usually w/in 001 to 003
of the bore since the slipper area is only subect to about 300 F

the 914 piston is of "cam ground design" which means you should expect
it to "mike" differently across the pin versus with the pin... don't
sweat the with-the-pin  measurement, since it is exactly what the
VW?Porsche engineers figured it should be & yu can't change it...

if the skirt 9o degrees to the pin is not within 003 of the bore meas in
that cyl, then you should either buy new p&c's ($800) or have y'er
pistons knurled to fit....  in the VW Bug world there is no option..
they throw away the p&c's & buy new ones..... it costs more for a set of
rings at NAPA than it does for a P&C set in Hot VW's ads !!!!!
