Thanks for the info, Jim!  Are you sure that the valves are supposed to be
adjusted every 3000 miles after the break-in?  I thought it was higher than
that...  As the valves seat, should their clearances change substantially?
I'm assuming so, since that's why they have to be done so frequently during
the break in.  The reason I ask is because after I adjusted my valves, I put
about 100 miles on the engine, and then took it into the shop, where they
found that they needed to be adjusted once again.  This kind of killed what
little faith I had in myself to get the job done right.  At this point, I'm
tempted to just let the shop do the adjusting... does anyone know what the
"book time" is for a valve adjustment?

Thanks again,
