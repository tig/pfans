Jeff and all,

I have had a problem with this cylinder-painting thread all along, and
Jeff's E-Mail finally crystallized my thinking.

I believe what he says about forced vs, radiant cooling; further, I find
it hard to believe that the factory, with five decades of
experimentation with this configuration, wouldn't have tried it.

But my biggest contention is the subject of rusted cooling fins on the
cylinders.  I have a very typical 911T engine sitting in my shop right
now for service - 80,000 miles, okay running condition; without a single
speck of rust on the case, cylinders or heads.  In other words, painting
cylinders black to avoid rust (corrosion), is IMHO, a fool's mission.

Far more important that we should concern ourselves with oil leaks and
caking of grimy-gooeys in all the cracks and crevices.  This is a much
more dangerous (and common) source of reduction of forced-air cooling.
