But, are you sure you would want to maintain the original configuration? I
mean, putting the ECU near the battery, and down low, while the battery is
exposed to rain is just plain stupid if you ask me. The ECU should be
mounted up higher and more towards the center line of the car so that it
gets as little rain on it as possible. The battery should be moved to a
covered location in one of the trunks, or at least placed in a marine case
in the original location.
