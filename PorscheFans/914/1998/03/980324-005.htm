     Just got back from a week of illness so I only caught the end of
     a Cylinder Painting Rift.  Forgive me if this has already been 
     discussed.
     
     Classically, radiantly cooling something has always been magnitudes 
     less efficient in a gaseous environment (earth's atmosphere) than 
     the heat one can take away from Forced Convection (air flowing over 
     cooled subject).  While space craft use radiant cooling 
     exclusively, they have no choice since there are no handy gases in 
     space to carry away heat.  Painting the 914 (or 911/912 etc) engine 
     a matte black would optimize it efficiency as a 'black body 
     emitter' (maximum radiant cooling), but the layer of insulation 
     from the paint would not insignificantly reduce the most important 
     source of cooling, the forced convection of air over the engine.
     
     Now I've not done this experiment to prove this idea.  It is based 
     on my Heat Transfer education (both theoretical and in practice) 
     since I'm a Mechanical Engineer and design computer cooling and 
     machine cooling systems.  I'd love to hear from anyone who has had 
     success with reducing operating temps in aircooled motors, and can 
     expose me as the armchair physicist I pretend to be!
