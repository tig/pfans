Greetings,
I am a son to be 914 owner ,
     ( fingers crossed )  
I have been reading the list for quite some time and enjoy it alot. I am
curious about a few things and maybe some of you have the answer. I hear
about a 914 club, can someone post some info on it as far as joining and
so forth. Also, is there something wrong with the PCA club, I get the
feeling that some do not like them and for what reasons I would like to
know.
  Has anyone had a vehicle shipped 
(hauled) to another state, I need some info one who & where they are,
possible
cost of such a thing. maybe one of you know someone in the south east
that does this sort of thing or has a trailer and might be interested in
doing a haul.
Has anyone seen the engine stand in the tweeks catalog that is a bench
mount type that says 911 and all other porsche motors. Do you think it
will hold up and is worth the 28$?  



thanks for the BW
