	Duh...  Sometimes working on the car makes me feel *really*
stupid.
	Recap:  The car didn't start.  No lights, no nothing.  All
that happened was that the fuel level gauge showed 3/4 full.
	I had three replies that suggested a problem with the battery
ground.  Sounded reasonable, I had just disconnected and reconnected
it when I put the battery on a charger.
	Cleaned, inspected, put on TIGHT!!!  No joy.  Messed around
with it for two days.  Still no joy.  Measured resistance of clamp,
strap, whole deal to firewall, battery post to engine fan shroud.  Not
perfect, but <0.5 ohms.  Meanwhile, battery voltage continued to drop.
	Today, at lunch, I noticed that there was a difference in
voltage when measured across the battery terminals versus across the
terminal CLAMPS.  Oh, merde.
	The problem was my POSITIVE battery terminal connection.  I
took the wire brush to the terminal because I couldn't think of any-
thing else to do.  Hmm, it looks a whole *lot* brighter, now.  In fact
the un-brushed part looks really dark and grotty.  Ummmm...  (Now I
start to feel sheepish.)
	Yes, yes, now it runs.  I'm happy about that.  Runs pretty
darn well in fact.  But I feel kinda dumb for not thinking about the
positive battery terminal.

	Live and learn!  Maybe this will even help the battery stay
charged, now!  (Or am I hoping for too much?)
