Hi;

hmmmm...  why go the pain of an engine swap to put in the 6 when the 8
should not be *that* much more work. i would suspect that an 8 of the same
power as a 6 might be easier on the drivetrain (assuming you are keeping the
901 trans), as the torque is divided over 8 power pulses as opposed to 6.
I'm thinking the nasty four i have in mine now is chewing up transmissions
way too fast as it is.

i'm kind of wrestling with the same quandary.  to get 450 hp from a "purist"
engine is going to be serious $$$, and as this is just a hobby, and i have
too many as it is....

the downside of this is zero resale value compared to popping in a 911 mill.
i figure that when i'm done with mine i'll have an extra $12,000 (cdn) tied
up, with the new trans/brakes/axles/shift linkage/tach mods/half shafts/what
ever else.

i built a pretty serious 2.6 4 cyl for my 74 (maybe 180 - 200 hp)  it's fun,
but not *fast*. one of my friends just got his viper, and another still has
his zr1, and i *hate* being passed on lapping days (yes, i am a child, and
have been practicing for the last 39 years).

i suppose i can see a bit of the purist thing, just not very clearly.  i
don't know about you guys, but i play with cars because of what they can do,
not what they are (or used to be in the early 70's).
