I've seen some what I think are 1.7 euro pistons hanging around. They
have a dome rather than a dish. I always thought the 2.0 liter euros
were the same scenario. They're not? Only flat-topped pistons I know
about are the NPRs, at least those for use on a 2.0. On a motor I used
to have (2.0), there were some rather deep dish pistons which I always
thought were for vanagons. It was something like a 1/2" dish. Were these
U.S. pistons? Also I've been told that the tranny mounts for a 914 are
actually stronger than 911 mounts. I had previously thought installing
club sport mounts would make for a hot setup on a 914. Someone want to
counter this?
