As I posted, I got rear ended last Saturday Night here in Seattle. The
Wrangler driver who hit me had out of state plates and had no proof of
insurance. Sunday, I went to the ER to have my "whiplash" looked at.Monday, I
rented a Ford Aspire (expire? perspire?) and let my insurance co. know so we
can proceed as if the villian was an uninsuired Motorist (UM). Tuesday, my
agent told me I can bill my Chiropractor and MD on the claim. Wednesday, the
APPRAISER (cue theme music) called as he had visited the car at the tow lot
and taken pictures. He wanted to move the car to the Insurance co's lot
outside of town to stop the building daily lot charge.Tow bill: $168 plus
$30/day! I allowed them to tow it to the new lot after being assured that I
retain full ownership of the car. The APPRAISER sent his pictures to THE
ADJUSTER (cue theme music). Thursday, the AGENT sent request to the POLICE for
a copy of the incident report to find more info on the villian, such as name,
adrress and SS# in order to find out if he has insurance. Friday, the AGENT
called to let me know that nothing will be done until they get the police
report (or I get it personally) in the middle of next week. The ADJUSTER had
decided that repairs to the 914 would exceed $3000 and hence, the car is a
total loss. "So how much will I get for it", I asked humbly. "That depends on
the descision of the EVALUATOR," said the AGENT. "If the villian is UM, then
we will pay you Actual Cash Value (ACV). If he has insurance, you must make a
deal with his co." 
So I have no 914 and no $ to get one.And I am paying out of pocket for a POS
just to get to work and back.
