2,000$ is cheap. 2,000$ will only buy you a beater 914 most likely. And the
500$ you'll get from selling it as is will buy you a set of heat exchangers
for your next car, not much in other words. Hell, I just spent 3,500$ just
on rust repair on my 2002. 

You have to decide how much you like the car. How much do you have invested
in it, including your time? How much are you attached to the car? Is the car
otherwise realitively rust free? Do you have any upgrades installed on the
car? Is the chassis twisted?

Deciding to repair a car is not a rational process. It's driven by a lot of
other nebulous things. There are cars that had trees growing up through the
floor that have been restored. So your car is no big deal to get fixed up again.

It's environmentally friendly to repair an old car vs. buying a new one, also.

several old German cars....
