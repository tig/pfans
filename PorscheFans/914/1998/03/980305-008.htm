Hey Nick, sorry to hear about your 914 getting totaled.  I munched the 
front end of my 914 into a stone wall on Saturday afternoon (note to self: 
stay at home on Saturdays, too many 914 accidents occur on that day).  I 
don't want to get into the details, however, cheap tires kill 914s as tread 
wear of 400 doesn't provide good wet-weather traction -- an expensive 
lesson learned, but genetically engraved now.  However, seat belts and the 
crush zones to work as me and my passenger were not injured in any way 
(physically, that is).

Anyway, I've got a while to go before repairs since money is now somewhat 
tight for me.  From the windshield back the car looks fine, except I do 
need to have the rear transmission cover replaced as it broke free from 
both mounting points (and it's a new tranny, damnit!).  Do I get another 
'75 1.8L with a good body (no drivetrain) and transfer everything?  I have 
a clean, solid lead with a junk yard for a complete nose under $900 (sheet 
metal only, includes hood, bumper and headlamp buckets), just need someone 
to weld it on (yes, Dave, I decided that the basic stock look did grow on 
me more than a fiberglass kit).

Any leads or suggestions?
