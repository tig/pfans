>Best Way to Bleed 914 Brakes?

I made a pressure bleeder using an old brake resevior cap, a tire valve, and a
clip on air chuck.  You drill a hole in the extra cap and put in the tire
valve, set the outlet pressure on your compressor to no more than 15lbs, and
clip the air chuck on the tire valve.  You then open the bleeder valves in the
order specified in the service manuals. You have to be careful that you don't
allow the fluid level in the resevoir to get too low.  You use the air
pressure on top of the fluid to push clean fluid through the system.  This is
much faster than the pump, pump the pedal (which doesn't always work well if
you drain the master cyl) and is also a one man set up.  

You had also be sure that your blue flex hoses to the hard plastic lines are
in good shape or you may blow brake fluid all over your nice shiney paint.
Just don't put too much air pressure to the system.  I use 10 psi, but Glenn
Stazak had to bump it up to 15 psi to get fluid through the master cyl after
installing a 19mm unit.  He tried in vain to manually pump the pedal and
pressurize the system enough to bleed it.  After a couple calls he finally
made one of these pressure bleeders and it worked the first time.  E-mail
Glenn at - gstazak@wheaton.il.us   ask him what he thinks about what we call
the "Perry Pressure Bleeder"

 I first made one of these pressure bleeders to bleed the lines on my custom
hydraulic clutch system, that uses about 13 feet of flex -2 teflon/stainless
lines (lots of turns, bends, and up and down routing).  I tried to use a Mity
Vac and it just wouldn't pull enough fluid to get all the air out.  This
pressure system has worked without fail.
