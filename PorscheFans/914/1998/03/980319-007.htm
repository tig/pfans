O.K., I need someone to tell me what's wrong with my train of thought
here...

I took my car into the shop a couple of weeks ago, and told them that I
needed to pass my emissions test.  They returned the car to me with a
printout indicating a CO of about 1.9%.  I took the car in for its emissions
test(s), and every time the CO was between .14% and .18%.  I didn't modify
anything, and the car ran exactly the same from the point that I picked it
up at the shop until I returned it yesterday.  What I'm trying to imply here
is that nothing changed between the shops reading and the state's reading.
I told them that it was running way too lean, and that they needed to adjust
it.  They did, and they said that it runs great with a CO of 5.8%, but
nothing less.

Here's what I'm thinking:  The shop's machine is out of whack.  The fact
that their machine says 1.9% and the state's says .14%, combined with the
fact that their machine says my car runs perfect at 5.8% leads me to believe
that the ACTUAL CO reading is probably closer to 3.0%.  Does this theory
hold water?  If not, is it safe to drive the car with a CO of 5.8%?  What
possible problem could cause an engine to only run good when really rich?

Thanks again,
