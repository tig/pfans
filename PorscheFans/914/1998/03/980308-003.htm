<< I suppose that it is possible that it's just the rings, but I can't
ignore
the fact that there is fresh oil leaking where the heads meet the
cylinders...>>

JJ, this oil leak most likely (99+%) has nothing to do with your
compression.  The oil leak is a separate problem.  Check your pushrod seals,
your valve cover gasket, and head breather port (on top) etc. to fix the oil
leak.

Under normal circumstances, there is no oil in your combustion chamber.  Oil
goes into the heads via the center of the pushrods to lube the valve train,
and returns to the crankcase via the pushrod tubes.  There is also oil mist
inside the crankcase, and this can get past the rings under certain
circumstances.

If you have oil in your combustion chamber, you will definately see blue
smoke coming out the tail pipe.

Oil in the combustion chamber can be caused by 3 things:
1.  Worn out valve guides
2.  leaky/worn/new piston rings, or rings that are installed with the gaps
"lined up" incorrectly, etc.
3.  worn out cylinder walls or "collapsed pistons" that allow too much
"piston rock."

If I were you, I would get a can of brake cleaner and wash the oil off the
engine near the leak.  Then find out where the oil is coming from, exactly.
Run the engine for a while, then jack up the car and check it with a bright
light, and maybe a mirror, if necessary.  Remember to check the top of the
engine too.  Oil leaks are pretty annoying, but you can fix most of them
without too much work, and definately without tearing down the engine again.
