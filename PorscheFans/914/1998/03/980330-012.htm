Already done, but this is a linear 'patch' and will shift the lower
temperatures rich as well. I don't want the regular running to get too
rich though.

Oh, I'm certain it's a design 'feature', and not some weird failure mode
or something. What I'd like to do is work out some kind of temporary fix
untill I have that fully programable FI system in place.

Does it say if the ECU supplies any fuel at higher revs or if the ECU
just plain shuts fule off altogether.
