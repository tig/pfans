To the List,
Exhaust studs:

Lot of discussion on these. The exhaust studs have been in most 914's for
over 22 years. Heat is what makes these suckers feel like there are extreme
critical dimensions on the threads. The studs are normal 8mm threads and the
mating holes the same standard.
 
Non-similair metals under well heated conditions, such as the exhaust system
are subject to, will corrode no matter the thread tolerances and size.
Moisture is also the culprit combined with the prolonged heating and cooling
cycles.

When you install studs, always use an anti-seize. The factory did, but in
the time frame mentioned above, the heat will eventually "cook" the
anti-seize into a useless state and contribute to the corrosion seen on the
studs as seen when removing the heat exchangers and complete exhaust system.

There is a saying. "Don't fix it if it ain't broke". True, but remove the
exhaust system nuts periodially and coat the 8 stud threads and the
retaining nuts with a good anti-seize and save yourself possible internal
thread damage later in life. This should be a twice yearly maintenance
procedure on newly installed studs. You don't physically have to remove the
exhaust system, just all 8 of the 8mm self-securing nuts, one at a time.
Never tighten more than 23.1 ft.lb. if torqueing. This torque is the head
torque figure for my 70 1.7. Correct this figure to the list if you disagree.

For the ones that have corrosion. 
Spray them good with a good rust penetrating product. Use the small plastic
tube that normally will be found on the can and squirt up INTO the nuts. Let
sit 30 minutes then do it again. Let it work overnight if possible. 
Before removing nut, spray again and back nut off about 1  complete
revolution. Do each like this. Once you can get the nut down some, spray the
top side of the nut and let it sit for 15 minutes. Then proceed to remove
nuts as above.  However, if the studs begin to turn when backing off the
nut, spray up above the nut into the threaded hole as soon as there is room
to do so. This will help to keep the threads intact as much as possible, but
is no guarantee that they will not pull material when screwing out the stud. 
ALWAYS WEAR EYE protection when working under the 914. 

Get a small acid brush from your auto supply store and use it for coating
the studs and nuts with the anti seize. After installing the nuts, coat the
lower portion of the studs again to restrict future moisture and corrosion.

Naturally, this is my own opinion and yours may be different. What works for
me may not work for you. Use your own discretion as you alone are
responsible for what you do to meet your own needs.
