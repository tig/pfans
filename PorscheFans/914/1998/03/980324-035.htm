Greetings, 914-er's!

There follows some reproduced comments on painting cylinders, coupled
with my $.02 worth:

Brian Mifsud writes:

"   Painting the 914 (or 911/912 etc) engine 
     a matte black would optimize it efficiency as a 'black body 
     emitter' (maximum radiant cooling), but the layer of insulation 
     from the paint would not insignificantly reduce the most
important 
     source of cooling, the forced convection of air over the engine.
  "

Jeff Lorentzen writes:

"   The idea is to paint them with a thin (emphasis on
thin) coat of flat black. This will affect the forced air convection
slightly but it is to prevent them from rusting which would
eventually
reduce it even more than the paint would.   "

  I think that Jeff is correct here... the idea is to cut down on
rust.

Thomas Evaul writes:

"  But my biggest contention is the subject of rusted cooling fins on
the
cylinders.  I have a very typical 911T engine sitting in my shop
right
now for service - 80,000 miles, okay running condition; without a
single
speck of rust on the case, cylinders or heads.  In other words,
painting
cylinders black to avoid rust (corrosion), is IMHO, a fool's mission.
 "

    I have never seen a 911 apart, so I can't comment about 911's,
but any time you are in the Lancaster, California area, you are
welcome to inspect my two sets of un-cleaned-up 2.0 litre barrels... 
you'll find considerable rust on all of them.

    I agree completely that there is plenty of opportunity for
oil-bound grime to cake up the cylinder fins, and that this is not
good for the engine, but you can't count rust out either, at least
not in the 914-4.

					Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
