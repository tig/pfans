That reminds me... I had to take my car for it's last smog check back in
August. The plastic thing that connects the air filter to the throttle
body had a crack in it, so the idle screw could be heard sucking air.

The mechanic, let's call him "Henry" (since that's his name), tells me
he needs to find "the vacuum leak" (I told him what it was three
times!), and he wants me to sit in the car with my foot on the gas and
hold 3000 rpm.

I didn't coudn't see what he was doing back there, but suddenly, i hear
this noise... best described as a "whump". I shut off the engine and
climbed out to see what this genious had done.

He was standing next to the passenger side, with a small PROPANE TANK in
his hands!!! Yes, he was sprayng propane vapour over the intake to see
where it would go, and  it found the distributor. 

While I was swearing and cursing at him, he just looked at me and said,
and I quote, "you know you have something sparking in there".

I swear every word is true...
