oh, oh!  when all else fails read the booK! 

i remembered this morn that i actually have the factory repair manuals! 
& i guess we should consider these the first & Last word on the
subject... 

interestingly, the manual shows a DOMED piston in all the photos.. (this
must be the mystical EURO piston, used in carbureted type 4's)

Porsche says measure the bore at a position 10-15mm below the top of the
cyl, which is where the worst bore wear should be manifested

  then measure the piston across the skirt slipper (your E) & the photo
shows it being done about 10-15 mm from the bottom edge of the
slipper... this apparently reflects the expectation that the most likely
failure of the piston would be due to slight collapse of the skirt due
to side loading in operation  (or SERIOUS wear, but i've never seen that
on a skirt except when scoring occurs & then it is always junk)

the allowable clearance (which our spec books call PLAY)  is .04-.06mm
(.0016 -.0024 in.) for the 1.7 motor, .015-.045mm (.0006 - .0018 in.)
for the 1.8 motor ... and .02-.06mm for the 2.0 

this is in the range you'd also expect if using the feeler gage
technique i described yesterday, so for guys without all the
micrometers, a set of long bore-feelers will do fine 

on a personal note, given the limited budgets many of us have,  If i was
again facing $800 for a new set of P&c's versus a used set that had good
bores & slight skirt collapse, I would go have the skirts expanded
(knurled), install Total Seal rings  & live with the expectation that it
might only last another 70,000 miles...   whereas in my current engine I
replaced everything (at great expense) & expect it to run 150,000..
(unless i start racing it)

 which means it will still be running long after i'm confined to the
rocking chair & some yet-to-be-born kid will discover this "old car in
the barn" & give it one more lifetime
