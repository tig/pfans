This may be hard to visualize, but....

There should be a small (3") 'L' bracket attached to the battery
tray, between the battery tray and the firewall.  (Towards the
front of the car.)

Depending on the specific year of the car, there may or may not be
a hole in the top of this bracket for the idle mixture screw.  A
1973 should have one.

The ECU fits into the bracket with the "big connector with all the 
white wires" facing TOWARDS the engine.  There should be a black
plastic cover for the connector.  This cover should force the wires to
go DOWN out of the ECU.

It's not uncommon for this bracket to NEED replacement when the
battery tray is replaced.  (Which is very common.)  But it's rare
that someone actually does it.

$.02:  This is the area of the car that Automobile Atlanta does
the best job of covering.  They have the right parts, and they
know what the car should look like when it's done right.  


Gary.
