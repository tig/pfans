    Interesting idea, Dave, but I think the math disproves it.

    Let's say that the weight in the rev-limiting rotor weighs a
    quarter of an ounce (1/64th of a pound), that it spins around in
    a circle with a radius of one inch (1/12 of a foot), and that
    the spark cuts out at 6000 RPM (which is 3000 RPM at the
    distributor, or 50 rotations per second).

    The centrifugal force on the weight due to its rotation within
    the distributor is (note that "^2" means "squared"):

               1/64 lb      (2 * pi * 1/12 * 50 ft/sec)^2 
        F = ------------- * -----------------------------
            32 (ft/sec)^2              1/12 ft

             1     (26.18)^2
          = ---- * ---------
            2048      1/12

          = 685.4 * 12
            ----------
               2048

          = 4 pounds.

    Let's assume that your car is screaming around the on-ramp at 60
    MPH (88 feet per second), and that the ramp has a radius of only
    50 feet.  The additional centrifugal force on the weight due to
    the car's rotation around the corner is:

              1/64 lb     (88 ft/sec)^2
        F = ----------- * -------------
            32 ft/sec^2      50 ft

             1    88^2
          = ---- * ----
            2048    50

             7744
          = ------
            102400

          = 0.075 pounds.

    Note that this was with best-case conditions (i.e., high speed,
    sharp radius, and no banking).  In the real world, where
    on-ramps are larger and banked -- and 60 MPH speeds are often
    difficult to achieve -- the effect would be much less.

    Yeah, I think that's the most likely explanation.
