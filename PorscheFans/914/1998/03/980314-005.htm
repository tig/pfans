I am about to embark on such a mission and would like to hear of advice
or pitfalls to this matter.

Also I can not justify a 911 motor as the cost is way too much.<<<


If you are doing a hi perf project car you'll have to do suspension, brake,
and trans upgrades, probably in that order.  Do these and then decide if you
have the money for a good used 911 engine and the parts to install.  While the
V6 conversion is cheaper horse power the 911 power plant will bolt up with no
molestation or loss of useablilty.  You'll lose the front trunk to a radiator,
a big plus to full use of a 914.  A friend in Dallas has built a very
"correct" V8 conversion; 915 velios converted gearbox with ltd slip, a mildly
built 350 with alumn intake and heads, and good plumbing and all professional
quality conversion parts.  It's a great car and an every day driver, but he's
got more than what you'd spend doing a 3.0. 

 If you put a Detriot engine in your 914 you may end up with more horsepower
than a Zuffenhausen product, but your car will be heavier and handling just
won't be close to what you have right now.  The balance of a 914 is what makes
it a great car.  You can't stuff an extra six or seven hundred pounds and not
pay the price somewhere.  If there's any way, find a 914 that's had a quality
conversion and drive it, and then drive a good V6 or V8 conversion car.
Remember that a Porsche engine will truly bolt up, and if you do a 2.2E spec
engine ( which should give you a solid 150hp) you should be able to get out
for around $5000 if you don't need heat, and if you do the work yourself, and
find a good deal on an engine.  You won't have half the trouble, your car will
be worth more, and you won't have to join "hair club for men" for all the hair
you'll pull out.  

Bottom line is it's your car, do what ever you want.  I always thought that
one of the new 32 valve V8 Lincoln Mark8 engines ( with Motronics, and dual
overhead cams) would be a cool engine to "make work" in a hot rod 914.  You've
already got a good example, so..... 

only food for thought
