Do to circumstances somewhat beyond my control, I have been forced to
sell my beautiful fully upgraded '70 914 after 4 years of fun. It is
going to a good home in Arizona and you will undoubtedly be hearing from
it's new owner.
 I'm going to play with rotaries for a while now. I've acquired a 1970
mazda R100. It was formerly a drag racer with fully stripped and
lightened interior replaced w/ bead-rolled aluminum, frame-welded
rollbar, full race fuel system, bridgeported 13B rotary (~300 HP) and
race prepped 4 spd tranny. All of this in a 1300 or so pound package!
I've acquired a parts car so I can convert it back to street-legal and
drive it to events. I'll be making it into an autoxer. I have to do some
mods to the suspension for this as well.It is with much excitement and
some sadness that I embark on a new adventure but leave the wonderful
world of 914's. Give me a few years, I'm sure I'll be back- maybe even
with a rotary 914!
  Thankyou everyone for your dedication to this hobby and all of the
incredible advice that has been freely given. This is truly the best
list out there!
Take Care, Mark Goldby  (I Shall Return!)
