Brian - Your choice will most likely come down to the Weltmeister or the
factory bushings. Weltmeister makes both the fornt A arm bushings and the
rear trailing arm bushings in both street and race compounds. The street
compound will still be a bit harder than the factory bushings and the race
bushings are rock hard. I'd recommend the street compound to you based on
your specifics. You can buy the factory A arm bushings from Porsche....only
problem is that they come attached to a new A arm. Hence the popularity of
the aftermarket bushings.
