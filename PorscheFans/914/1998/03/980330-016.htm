OK, if you are electronically skilled, you can pick a PTC thermister that
will compliment the NTC one in the head such that the overall response will
be that the reistance goes back up when the head gets above a certain
temperature. You will ahve to stick your nose into some thermister spec
books to find the right value and response curve.

What the quote means is that the pulses to the injectors is terminated (the
fuel is shut off conpletely) when the throttle position is closed and the
engine revs are higher than idle speed. It's a designed-in feature to
prevent backfires and to reduce exhaust emissions. It's in the ECU box.
There's nothing you can do about it except to remove the overrun bypass valve.
