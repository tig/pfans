Yes, the clicks should be evenly spaced... at least mine are.  At this point
I would recommend checking out your mixture.  The easiest way that I've
found is to drive along at 60 mph (assuming that your car bucks at 60), put
your foot on the clutch, turn the engine off, shift to neutral, and cost to
the side of the road.  Once there, pull the spark plugs an look at the
ceramic insulators.  If they're black and sooty, then you're running rich.
If they're white, you're running lean.  If they're slightly tan, then you're
pretty close to normal.  If that checks out, then I would investigate both
your wiring harness and ignition system.  To check for loose wires, simply
wiggle and tug on the various wires while the engine is idling.  If you
notice a change in the engine's behavior when you  move a wire, you've found
one.  If that checks out, check your spark.  To do this, disconnect all four
fuel injectors from the wiring harness, pull one of your spark plugs,
reconnect it to the spark plug cable, and ground the plug (touching it to
the fan housing should work fine).  Then, have a friend crank the engine
while you look at the spark.  It should be a nice thick white arc.  If it's
not, then you may have a problem with your coil, rotor, cap, or wires.
These ideas should get you started, though.

Good luck!
