As my boss would say, "that wasn't the question"...
But now that you mentioned it...

by the backyard mechanic.

The rotary shouldn't take much more time to drop, the only additional
connections are the two coolant hoses.  I think backyard mechanics are usually
just afraid of the rotary being different, it's not that they are any more
involved to work on.  In reality, there is no valve train, no reciprocating
parts, no distributor, etc.  As long as you follow the proper procedures to
split the housings, and take proper care of the gasket surfaces, they appear
very simple.

There are only a few things that can go wrong internally with a rotary.  The
"rings" (I forget what they are called, it has been a few years since shop
class), housing seals, or bearings.  Most problems are external and should be
repairable as bolt on items.  I remember hearing that a rotary was the only
type of motor you could dependably get 300hp out of in an afternoon just by
bolting performance items on.  Granted, all my rotary knowledge is based on
schooling and not personal experience.

I do wonder how the drive ability of a 914 would be with stock gearing and no
low end torque though.
