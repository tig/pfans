O.k., here's what I did to CC the heads, and it worked pretty well.  Get
yourself some plexiglass and cut it into a circle that will fit inside the
cylinder recess, and cover the combustion chamber completely.  Then, drill a
hole in the center of it about 1/4 in. in diameter.  Place the disk over the
combustion chamber and begin filling it with a graduated syringe.  The disk
makes sure that the surface tension doesn't throw your measurement off, and
the small hole allows for the air to escape while filling up the chamber.
Also, I used brake fluid rather than water, but I cannot remember why...
