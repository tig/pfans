	Hi, all.  Two memorable experiences this weekend that I thought
y'all should hear about.  I'll do the second one first.

	Driving home from an autoX, I noticed that my voltmeter was
reading low.  I mean REALLY low, <10 volts.  The idiot light was out,
though, so I just thought, "Stupid (*@!#%(%&*%!! gauge, I should try
to get it working right one of these days!"
	Then I changed lanes, using my turn signal as I always do.
The car started cutting out and back in again in time with the signal!
Uh-oh, says I!  No more turn signals, no more brakes (those lights!)
and I really hope I make it home by dark!!!
	Nope, was not to be.  It started cutting out on its own, so I
pulled off the highway onto a surface street.  To have the motor die
at a red light.  8^(
	I pushed the car a couple hundred yards (seemed like it!!) into
a parking lot, and started poking around in the engine compartment.  I
had an alternator belt, and it was tight.  I had an alternator pulley,
that seemed to be attatched to an alternator.  I had a battery, and I
had nice shiny tight connections.  I had a voltage regulator that... Uh.
Wasn't quite plugged in.  Duuuuuhhhh.  That would explain why the idiot
light never went on; it runs off the VR output!
	Plugged it in, got a jump-start from a friendly stranger, and
now all is fine.  (Mostly.)

	Second Stupid 914 Trick:
	Drove to a friend's house after the autoX on Saturday.  The
weather forecast had been kinda gloomy, but the day was gorgeous!  No
top, of course--it was in the trunk.
	Then I saw a storm up ahead.  No problem, I thought, if I stay
above 35 MPH I'll never get wet!  So I keep tootling along, into the rain.
Then I notice that some of the raindrops are BIG.  And kinda solid-
looking.  Ohmigod, they're HAILSTONES!  And what's the first thing every-
one does when they drive into a hailstorm?  Slow down.  Below the critical
speed for hail, which seems to be about 55 MPH.  Ouch!  Splat!  Hey, OW!
	I thought I got a lot of funny looks for driving home in the rain
without the top--it was NOTHING compared to driving in the hail!
	Thinking quickly (miracle of miracles!!!), I reached down into my
passenger footwell, and dug out:  My AUTOCROSS HELMET!!  Which I then put
on.  I looked over at the guy in the Rx-7 next to me, gave him a big grin
and a thumbs-up.  He was laughing so hard he almost lost control of the
car.
	I think my helmet has a few new scars.  Better that than my head!
