Brian, Mike,
Great tutorials for removing/cleaning the tank.

I cleaned the tank this way and it lasted about a year and a half
before fine rust started clogging the filter on a weekly basis.
I just finished having the tank coated by a local radiator shop ($115)
and they look to have done a good job. I painted the tank exterior but
used semi-gloss black - seemed to match my original color better.

Word of caution - if you get the tank coated, leave the *bolts* for the
expansion
tank and sender unit screwed into the tank so you don't have to spend an hour or
so chipping the coating off the threads like I did (the threads are pretty fine
and you can't get the bolts started if there is *anything* on the threads).

I let the fuel out through the pump hose - I don't like crawling under
the car, and the steering rack cover is a PITA to put back on. Draining at
the rear is probably the best though.

If you confuse easily (like I do), or it will be a while before reassembly,
label the hoses before you take them all off. There is a diagram in Haynes,
but no picture.

Also, I've removed the tank (too) many times and never found it necessary
to remove the hood. I did have to remove the expansion tank on my '76 to
unplug the lead to the sender before removing the tank.

While I was in there I installed a factory swaybar and cleaned the area
under the tank, used POR-15, etc. and removed/lubricated the front blower
(also lubbed the wiper mechanisms, but didn't take them out).

Adding a petcock in line is a good idea! I usually just plug the line
with a metal punch when replacing the filter.

Jeff,
I used your tip for replacing the felt pads under the tank with
closed cell foam - thanks.

I think I mentioned the Radio Shack tool for removing the connectors,
but haven't tried it yet and it doesn't really look right to me.
If you find the right tool, please post a description.
