Last question and I should be ready to attack this problem.

Does the direction of the plug into the MPS matter?  If so what is the
correct way?  The plug has the one side with beveled edges.  The connector
on the MPS isn't keyed so the plug can go in either way.  I looked at a
spare MPS I have (good coils but won't hold vac) and it looks like there is
a line molded into the face of the connector that could be interpreted as
the beveled side being toward the MPS mounting side.

I may have a line on the Lisle brand wire terminal tool (#56500)  that
Kjell's article mentioned, will check at the auto parts store on the way
home tonight.

Thanks,
Jeff

You need that thing hooked up to do anything.
