    Sam:

    Autopower can add whatever custom features you like, and --
    especially if you live here in San Diego (where AutoPower is
    located) -- it won't cost much.

    I don't have an Autopower roll bar, but I do have the first
    bolt-in CAGE that they ever made for the 914, so maybe my
    comments will help.

> How did you mount a safety harness? 

    The same way they're mounted in all the SCCA GT-2 914s that I've
    seen:  With eyebolts through the rear firewall, backed up by BIG
    steel plates.

    I don't know how the roll bar works; with my cage, there's a
    diagonal bar that goes from approximately the center of the rear
    hoop to the lower end of the passenger-side rear hoop upright.

    The bar is coplanar with the rear roll hoop, so some passenger
    seats WILL fit in front of the bar... But your passenger will
    have to have pretty short legs.

    Does your 914 still have a non-movable passenger seat?  If so,
    the diagonal bar will cross IN FRONT OF the seat (if it fits at
    all), making it impossible to carry a passenger.

    My diagonal brace is removable, and I leave it in the garage when
    I'm driving the car on the street.
