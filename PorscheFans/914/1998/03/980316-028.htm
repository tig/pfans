I'm posting this for Toby Erkson- his mail admins are messin' with their
servers again, so the list is rejecting his posts right now...

Subject: 1.8L 1/10 mile data needed

Okay, like my accident wasn't enough damage the cop that showed up at the
scene wrote me a "Careless Driving" ticket.  I've never had a problem with
the police and I know they have a largely thankless job, but this jerk has
no foundation, no proof or grounds to give me one (I think the clown he was
with convinced him to give me one).  There were no witnesses, no skid marks
(raining, wet ground, cheap tires (400 treadlife), long wet grass, no speed
limit or merge signs, shallow curb), just his partner claiming that I *must*
have been doing at least 60-70mph for me to do what I did.  Okay.
I now know why he is on patrol and not a detective...

Here's what I need from a fellow 1.8L (1.7L and 2.0L info is *worthless* for
me in this situation) owner to help prove my innocence in court: Your BEST
1/10 mile time AND speed.  My accident occurred *well* within 1/10 mile and
total passenger and luggage weight was around 370 lbs.  I haven't checked my
fuel level (guessing about 1/2 full) but I will add
this to the vehicle weight as well.  This is what kills me, crap, I have to
prove I wasn't driving carelessly -- in fact, there were a couple split
second choices I had to make that showed good driving skill.  So I'm putting
my Physics 201 to work and need the 'best case' scenario data.


I've already figured out that if I was just trying to haul butt I would
barely reach 50mph at a 1/10 mile.  I also am using the "Porsche 914 914-6"
book by Brian Long, along with photos of my car, to show the crumple zones
and how effective it was in keeping damage minimized (look at the gaps for
my doors, they are still the same!).  Other data comes from my Owner's
Manual.

Why I got the ticket:  Young looking male driver and a two-seater sports car
with PORSCHE emblazoned on the back.  Gee, thanks for the 60-70mph
compliment, but you're dead wrong pal!

You can send responses directly to me.
