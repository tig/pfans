So, I'm starting to think that my (still installed) Decel valve is
non-op. Hmm, I'll have to check that out when I dig my 914 out of the
snow. Gads! I need a garage!!!

That's what I belived to, but I wanted to confirm it myself.

Yup. Went from 0.62 on the O2 output to 0.45 at high rpm WOT. Had to
wick it up to (ahem) non-legal speeds in order attain steady state high
rpm WOT though. :)
