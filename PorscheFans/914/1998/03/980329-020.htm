Hi all,

	Well, the O2 sensor and HT sensor/gauge are now in the car. I took the
car out for fun and games today while the weather was still favorable
and the roads were dry (there's about 2" of snow outside now, drat!). So
now I've got some very interesting info to pass along, and I would also
very willingly accept comment on this too. (D-Jet)

	First off, the reason why the engine leans out so badly on straight
aways (sustained high rpm runs) seems to be related to head temp more
than the pressure in the manifold. Good comfortable running seems to be
at about 300 degrees on the HT sensor, but the temp climbs in a hurry
during sustained high rpms and as the temp reaches 350 F the mixture
starts leaning out quickly and by 375 F the mixture was noticably lean.
I didn't let the heads get a whole lot hotter though. Unfortunately, the
heads got this hot is a real hurry, not terribly promising for future
high speed events. (Does anyone _really_ know what the "do not exceed"
temperature for the heads is?)
	This I see as a bad combination, the heads get hotter so the computer
leans the mixture out, which in turn makes the heads get even hotter. In
about a year (maybe less) I plan to install a fully programble
injection/ignition system, and with this I think there's a better
approch. The mixture gets leaned out why? I'm guessing it's to prevent
detonation, but I could easilly be wrong. If this _is_ the case, then a
more sophisticated brain could retard the timing if the heads get too
hot. Or better yet, there could be a knock sensor on there somewhere. :)
	Question: What exactly is the mechanism of a knock sensor, and what
physically is it detecting. In other words, what exactly is making the
sound/shock/vibration that the KS is picking up? Knowing this would be a
big help in figuring out where and what exactly to mount a KS on an
air-cooled engine. Any of you modern 6-cylinder types know where your
knock sensor is mounted? I'd find it hard to imagine a DME or otherwise
equiped engine without a knock sensor.

	On another note, the mixture obviously goes _way_ lean when the
throttle is fully closed above idle. I think this is a result of the way
the TPS talks to the brain and the fact that the brain does't really
know how fast the engine is turning. Once the TPS detect a fully closed
throttle it tells the brain to go to the idle setting, it's a nice
little feature to be able to have a settable idle mixture (ECU knob).
But the problem I see is that the engine may be spinning at lots of revs
(3, 4 or 5k) when that throttle is snapped closed. There is then little
or no fuel being delivered (per pulse) while the vacuum that the MPS
sees is substantial. Does this sound right so far? So if this is what's
going on, doesn't it seem to be a little unhealthy for the engine to be
running so lean at higher revs (albiet for short periods of time)?
	And yes, the mixture does indeed go _WAY_ lean when the throttle snaps
closed at high revs. How lean? So lean that my sensor can't measure, the
output goes to -zero- volts. (0-1V range, .50 being stoichiometric). As
the revs come down, the mixture begins to richen up again. At or above
5k rpm, snapping the throttle closed sends the mixture to leansville
where the O2 sensor doesn't seem to be allowed.

	I welcome any and all comments and/or critiques.
