  Yes, but it is more likely that they are worn to the point of
barely closing... this would result in "extra" pulses, making the
D-Jet system think you are at higher revs... hence more fuel.   This
would be more consistent with the radio interference.  (Excellent
idea to include that information, by the way... every bit of symptoms
helps in remote diagnosis!)

  An equally likely cause is poor / intermittent grounds in the
system... check the notorious set of push-on terminals that cluster
around the rearmost upper engine case bolt for bad / corroded crimps,
corroded connector surfaces, and broken wire strands.   Apply contact
cleaner (Radio Shack TV Tuner Cleaner or equivalent) liberally while
"excersizing" the connectors (pull them off and push them back on
several times).   Replace any terminals suspected of corrosion inside
the crimp area or with broken wire strands.  If it is necessary to
replace any terminals, be sure to crimp them on CLEAN copper!
   Also, check the ground strap from the transmission case to the
chassis, and the battery ground cable and connections.

  Yes.

   To absolutely eliminate the cold-start injector, it will be
necessary to disconnect it's fuel line, and block the line to prevent
fuel leaking on the engine.   Disconnecting the electrical connector
(I assume this is what you've done, based on your description) will
eliminate any false signals reaching the valve as culprits, but will
not eliminate a defective (leaky) valve itself.

  Inspect the trigger points for excessive wear, pitting, or burning.
  Replace as necessary.  Also check the grounds... see above.

					Good Luck,
                                                            Jim T.
