My 914-4 (2.0 D-jet, after-market ignition) is not running well when its 
cold.  I have a list of things to check out but I was wondering if anyone 
has had similar symptoms and could point me towards likely suspects.  The 
car runs great when warm, but I mean like only when it is above 70 F 
outside and I have been driving a while.

When I first start it I have two probelms: 1) it misses/stutters when it 
is under load, then it will pick up again with normal power, then miss, 
etc. 2) it will occasionally backfire (exhaust) when I am off the 
throttle, like coasting to a stop or if I shift slowly into second.  The 
backfiring goes away first, probably after running 5 minutes or so.  The 
missing takes a good deal longer, but eventually does go away.  Any 
obvious culprits?

Thanks,

Clark Brown
