The time-sert kits are kind expensive; they're about $50 per size, and come
with 5 inserts.  I just ended up getting a set recently to fix the threads
for the bolts that attach the tranny to the engine.  They additionally sell
a tap guide plate with is supposed to square up your drill bit and set up
the tap correctly; I think it was around $20.  I really considered having
a shop do this work rather than myself, but in checking around, found out
that the local shops only did helicoils, which aren't as strong.  And the
cost of having them do (and transporting the engine to the shop) would have
ended up being much more hassle than trying it myself.  Of course, the
last time I really touched this engine was about 1.5 years ago, so time was
not of the essence for me....  BTW, their website is www.timesert.com
If you do go have a shop do it, find out if they use a timesert or a helicoil.
Also, they'll most likely need to install it lining things up by hand also,
although they will have more experience and have the car on a lift.


Good luck,
Mike
