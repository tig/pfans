I had a couple of very slightly damaged wires going to the MPS, and it
caused nothing but trouble.  Once new wires and a new connector were
soldered in everything worked fine.  The slightest leak in the hose to the
MPS will also cause major problems.  The symptoms that you're describing
while driving (let off the gas and it nearly dies before returning to an
idle) sounds exactly like mine, which, according to the State of Colorado
has a CO of .14%.  My car is going back to the shop tomorrow to get the MPS
adjusted and bring the CO back into the correct range.  If I were you I
would fix the wires to the MPS (which I'm guessing will let you start the
car once again), and then check the CO at 3000 rpm to see if it's going
lean.  Also, make sure you check it when it's warm (if you haven't been
already).  It wouldn't hurt to check your Tacoma just to make sure that it's
not the CO meter's fault.
