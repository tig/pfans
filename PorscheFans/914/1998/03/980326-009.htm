The urathant mounts are indeed cheaper, are very sturdy, and will
improve the shifting to boot. However, the downside of it is that they
will transmit more engine vibration to the chassis of the car. If you
can live with increased buzzing and rumbling, then they're a decent
alternative.

I have them on my car now, and I like them alot. Even though technically
they're not legal for the class I race in.

Oh yeah, if you autox or race your 914, those solid tranny mounts are
very likely not legal for any "stock" class you may run in.
