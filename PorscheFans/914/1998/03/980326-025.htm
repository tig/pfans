Jack,

I saw your posting about removing fenders.  This isn't an easy job on a 914,
you'll get good at grinding spot welds if you do this repair!  

If you don't have a good set of safety goggles, go out and get a good set
FIRST!  It's much easier to protect your eyes, than try and replace or repair
them!  Also, a good 2.0 914 is loads more fun than a sight dog. You'll also
find that a good pair of leather gloves will save your hands.  

Don't forget hearing protection either.  what?  whaT??  whAT???  WHAT DID YOU
SAY???  <---(often heard at the old folks home for mechanics and rock &
rollers) I SAID DON"T FORGET THE EAR PLUGS!!!

How you plan to put the fender back on will determine the best method to use
for removal.  If you plan to spot weld the fender back on, you will definately
want to take off the old fender as clean as possible, this isn't an overall
bad idea anyway.  You don't want to bung up the pinch weld flanges any more
than you have to.  Some of the seams are comprised of three pieces and you are
better off it you can cut only the top layer.  The toughest part though is in
the door jamb.  This is really a tight area, and there's usually one spot weld
on the top underside, that you just can't get to.  Just take your time, and
plan to do clean up work after you get it off.

If you grind them out you'll need a good compressor, a die grinder, and some
good carbide burrs.  I got Ingersol-Rand die grinder on sale for about $70,
and I spent the same on a set of burrs from Eastwood.  They are good tools,
and will last through many restorations.  The biggest problem with using a
carbide burr for grinding is the little chips of steel that you grind off the
car.  These go everywhere, and are sharp enough to stick in your skin.  We
position a shop vac nozzle as close as possible to suck up chips.  I use
rubber gloves, the longer cuffs keep chips from going inside the gloves.  You
have the most control with the die grinder.  You can grind more precicely
through each weld, and you don't have to cut completely through. It really is
a pain with all the little sharp chips though, and a carbide burr against a
body panel is very loud.

Spot weld cutters are pretty handy.  If you haven't seen one, they are little
metal cutting hole saws, with a drill or pin punch in the center.  They cut
around the spot weld and leave a little round area to grind off.  This really
works good, but you have to be careful not to cut into the second layer of
metal.  The cutter I got (from Easwood again) has a adjustable pin for setting
the depth of cut, and this makes it easier to control.  You can only cut
straight down on the weld though, and you can't go at the weld at any angle.
This is the limiting factor with a spot weld cutter, you have to have a good
straight shot at it.

Drilling is probably the cleanest and easiest way to cut a spot weld.  You
should mark the center of each weld with a good punch.  Be sure you have a
good dimple, this will keep the drill from walking.  Use a 1/4 or so bit to
drill through the center.  This leaves a hole that you can then use to spot
weld the new panel.  You can drill at an some what of an angle if you have to,
but like the spot weld cutter, you are limited.  Be careful which welds you
drill through though, because in some areas you may not be able to fill the
holes with weld.

You will find that it takes a combination of these methods, and gentle work
with a chisel.  Personally, I only drill if the new panel is directly welded
through the holes.  If you have to go back and weld up drill holes, you are
only making more work.  When you start opening a seam to chisel, use a wood
chisel to open up the seams between panels.  Don't pry or try to cut with the
wood chisel, just use it lightly to open the edge of the seam, then go after
it with a metal chisel.  If you have done a careful job with cutting the
welds, you shouldn't have to do a lot with the chisel, except split the
panels.  There will be some welds that you may have to cut with the chisel,
just be careful.

I would feel happy with myself if I took off a 914 fender in a day's work.
Putting the fender back on is a whole different story, and tougher.  The best
way to put it back together is with a spot welder of course, but that's a
luxury I don't have yet either.   It's always easier to tear something apart.
Putting it back together is what separates actual motor cars from the garage
pets.

If there's anything I can help you with let me know.
