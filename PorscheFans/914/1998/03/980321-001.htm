Boy, nothing makes you appreciate the "feeble" performance of the 914 like
having to drive a VW Rabbit for 18 months!

I have no idea where the shop actually set the CO, but my 914 is running
better than it ever has.  It's completely smooth at idle and constant
throttle, and when you open it up... hold on!  There's still an occasional
"burble" from the exhaust, but I could really care less at this point.  Now,
it just wouldn't be like me if I didn't ask at least one question, so here
it is...

The engine's only got about 150-200 miles on it since the top end rebuild.
The valves have been adjusted twice, and then oil has been changed twice.  I
haven't taken it above 4,000 RPM (but boy do I want to!), so now I'm
wondering... what's next?  Should I get another 100 "safe" miles on it,
change the oil again, and then "really" drive it?  Do I need to get even
more miles on it?  The bottom end has about 3000 miles on it, so I'm fairly
certain it's broken in already.  I really don't want to screw this up...

Thanks again for everyone's help!  I simply cannot explain just how valuable
this list is!
