To Dave and the WHOLE 914 list.
Thanks Dave. You made my day. Saving mail space by sending to the list only.

The RickeyDo 914 Torsion Spring tool is for the rear trunk torsion springs.
 
Anyone wanting to make ONE tool for their OWN use can have a copy of my
drawing that shows how to make this tool. I also include instructions how to
use it. I offer drawings to the 914 list from time to time, but most of you
just ignore these freebies. And I thought you people were smarter :-)))))
since we ALL have or want to own a 914, the only sensible Porsche ever made.

The Ricky Do is named in honor of my GOOD friend Ralph Ricks. I was having a
problem wrestling with the torsion spring and thought there has to be an
easier way. Ralph said that it was a PIA to do, but he always used a box end
wrench to do this unsafe job and sometimes it requires 2 people. The Ricky
Do is not only easier, but you can do the job by yourself in about 10
minutes, BOTH SIDE. Use at your own risk cause we all are not rocket
scientists. :-)))))

How do you get the drawing. Well you can get it by asking for it. It
requires being sent by REGULAR mail, so send me a self addressed stamped
envelope and I will mail you the drawing that show how to fabricate it.

Address to:
Mike Cooley, Sr.
8070 Cinders Road
Memphis, Tn. 38133

If you want to rent the tool from Ralph Ricks, e-mail him and he will
instruct you about the rental. He has the ONLY original in the world that I
made just for him because he had helped many 914 owners with their 914
problems. Thanks Ralph.

Other illustrations that I done are for setting your throttle switch on 1.7
&1.8, and the 2.0 fuel injection models. All instructions written by Ralph
Ricks so you know its right.

A front floorpan patch CAD drawing that you can make to repair the rusted
out floor that I have made to patch my own 914 floor. This one will have to
be sent by regular mail to keep the clarity of all the dimensions since most
of you will probably not have Autocad Lite for Windows 95.

I will illustrate some of your ideas and procedures if what you tell me
comes through exactly like you want it shown. Small drawing only that will
fit on a standard sheet of paper. I will be using Corel Draw, AutoCad 12 and
AutoCad Lite as my drawing tool. No wild hairs please and allow me time to
do it right.
I do not charge for what I do. Its a hobby. No guarantees on anything.

I love the 914 and 914 owners.

Mike Cooley
Memphis, Tn.
