 ( caution ... non purest content )   to heck with them!
 
 Please tell if have installed a buick v-6 3.8 in a 914
 I am about to embark on such a mission and would like to hear of advice
 or pitfalls to this matter.
 
 
 Also I can not justify a 911 motor as the cost is way too much.
 
 I hope I do not insult anyone.
 

Ed,   I've owned my 914 for nearly 27 years now and although I can appreciate
an original example of any Porsche the 914 is at very best pathetic in it's
performance. Mine was severly modified many years ago to make it go like it
should have from the factory....I have been around a couple of conversions but
never owned one myself. The biggest problem they all encountered was the
cooling system and the routing of the lines to the front mounted radiator.
Also you will have to cut a very large hole in the car to get air through the
radiator.
Another thing to keep in mind is that the chassis itself is rather weak and
flexable...the additional torque of the 3.8 along with the weight will place a
lot of undue stress on the rear suspension mounts...you may consider some
stiffining plates and other reinforcements in that area...I have seen rear
suspensions literally torn out of the back of hot rodded 914's...
And yes....the cost of the 911 engine has become an embarrassment to me...it
is a great engine, I have owned several and rebuilt many, yet the power to
dollar ratio divided by the common sense factor makes me realize how practical
the chevy small block really is!!
Done neatly it can be quite an improvement....by the way get a hold of Kennedy
Engineered Products (KEP) in Palmdale Calif. for all the adaptors you will
need and some really usefull information..
