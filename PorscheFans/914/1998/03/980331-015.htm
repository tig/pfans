Hi Dirk,

Saw you got some good answers from Josh so I'll just add my .02

I got the initial numbers from a guy on the VW bus list.  I'm going to be
using a Cyberdyne gauge, about $30 from Jeg's catalog.  It's a simple LED
bargraph.  I'll put my Fluke DVM across it when I first get it wired up
since I want to see what the actual numbers are to compare with the LED's.
I'm using a generic Bosch O2, #13950 3-wire sensor.  It was $69 at Kragen's
Auto, heard they can be found for around $60 but I was there so got it.

For the bung (which I brazed into the 180deg bend in my Bursch, after the
4-2-1 merge) I got one of those HELP packs that had 2 anti-fouler spark
plug adapters.  Suppose to be used to help a plug in an oily cylinder.  Has
threads to go into the head then the interior of the adapter has threads
for the spark plug.  Suppose to shield the plug in the cylinder.  The
interior threads are 18mm and match the O2 sensor.  $4.99 for 2 adapters.
Just cut off the bottom threads and shape the end to match the curve of the
exhaust pipe.  I'm going to put the other bung on my VW Thing ( has carbs,
that suck ;-) to check the jetting.

I'm interested in homebrewing an oxy sensor setup. Based on what has been
discussed so far, it seems like a fairly simple thing to build. I have
several questions.
What's the difference between 3 wire and 2 wire sensors in terms of voltage
output range and accuracy? I know that the 3 wire ones are heated and the 2
wire ones are not. I think Josh said that the 3 wire sensor has a 1 volt
range, is that the same as the 2 wire sensor? He also said that 0.5 volt
was
stoichiometric, is that also true of the other type of sensor?
How close do the 2 wire ones have to be mounted to the exhaust port? Does
it
matter very much? How much current does the heater for the 3 wire sensor
draw?
Since the output of these things is a voltage, it seems to me a simple
matter of installing a small, panel mount analog voltmeter with a 1 volt
range. Can the oxy sensor be of any brand? Is there a certain part number
and brand that works best for mounting in an exhaust pipe? Where do I get
the weld on bungs to mount the thing?
Any help would be appreciated.
