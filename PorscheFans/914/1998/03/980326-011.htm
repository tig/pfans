Ohh evil temptation.  The pack rat in me is coming to the surface.  Do you
know if this was a sale or a new standard price?

My engine is suppose to have a "big bore" kit, all the info I got from the
PO.  It may not  or it could be the 96mm set.  I won't know for sure till I
get around to pulling the engine and heads so I can check them and the
comp. ratio. which will be months from not, maybe even till after the
Monterey Historics.

I'd been thinking of going to the euro set if I need to rebuild and do have
standard set.  Can anyone tell me more about the 96mm big bore sets?  Do
they require machining the heads and spigot holes in the case or are they a
slip in?  If machined and I have them now then I'm stuck with them, if
not???   Which would be preferable the big bore set or the euro set and
exactly why?

Thanks,
Jeff

     Tom and Wayne are gonna hate this...  I just got a note
from Dr. 914 (at Auto Atlanta) suggesting that AA would sell new
Euro 2.0 Ps&Cs for $395!  And not at a loss, either.
     Sounds like this is a pretty darn good time to rebuild
your 2.0 motor if you need it!
