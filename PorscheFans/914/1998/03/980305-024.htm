Toby and other List members who have wrecked their 914,

Does your area have a good vocational school that teaches auto body repairs? 
You would be surprised at the quality of the students as they are learning
the body shop trade. They are taught and graded by their instructor. Why not
see if you can have them repair your 914. Waiting list can be long as spring
approaches since more will be on the road. Check NOW. If they do, donate a
good tool to the school as a token of your appreciation when work is
completed. They can always use good additional tools in tax supported schools.

Selling outright is best for the 914 to survive the bone yard if you can
find someone who wants to save it if you decide to sell. $500-$600 will
probably be the max someone would give you in the wrecked condition.

Parting it out MAY get you more bucks over the course of time if you have a
place to store all the good parts, but another 914 will be dead. Many on
this list have parts for sale. Probably will still have most a year or two
later.

Has your insurance declared it a total? Look in your area for current prices
of 914 that are selling. Library has newspapers on micro-fisch that you can
view. Approach your insurance company with these figures backed up by
hardcopy of current prices. Do a hardnose job on them before seeing an
attorney. Explain that you want the fair market value to replace yours.
Usually you can buy the wrecked 914 back from insurance after settlement for
about $250 and salvage what you can if it is not outside your price range to
repair.

All the above is my .02 since I went thru the same as you. I had to use an
attorney which did not provide enough money to buy another 914 like I lost.
I was also injuried but MRI did not show anything. I still have pain 4 years
later and now wish I had not settled for low figure I received which was
VERY SMALL.

Good luck.
