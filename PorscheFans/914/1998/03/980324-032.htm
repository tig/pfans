Hi Mike!

"  I am going to cut out a new piece of plexi, turn the motor on it's
side and measure the piston dish.  I'll tell you, it doesn't look
like 4 cc's to me though.  Could these be USA pistons? How do you
tell?  "

  Hi Larry!  You mentioned:

"   those are early stock p's...nominal 7.6 CR...  the later 2.0 had
more dish & lower CR.  Euro p's have flat top as I understand it from
the guys at GPR   "

   I don't know about other brands, but my Kolbenschmidts were
advertised as "Euro"  pistons, have a pronounced dish (4cc), and with
stock 60cc combustion chambers, calculated out to be 7.9-something to
one, so I presume that it is possible to have 8 to 1 (Euro) pistons
with a dish... although it may also depend on whose pistons you are
talking about.   I have a set of Mahle's that came out of the engine,
and these also have a pronounced dish, but I believe that they are
stock 7.6 to 1 (USA)  pistons.   The only way that I know of to tell
them apart is to measure their deck height without shims and dish
volume, add in standard head gasket thickness, assume 60cc combustion
chambers, and run the numbers.   If the results come out to be 7.6 to
1, then they are USA pistons.   If 8 to 1, then Euro. 
   Someone out there must have a way of interpreting the codes
stamped in the bottom of the pistons, which would be a much easier
way of doing it; maybe they will read this and post.

 "  I have a reciept that the PO gave me that states euro pistons but
doesn't mention anything other than that.  I guess I'm looking at
getting somewhere around 8.25:1 for CR. (a happy middle) I have no
idea so I'll take your suggestion and ask around.  "

  Sounds like a good compromise... let me know when you get the dish
volumes,and I'll run the numbers for you.

   By the way, Larry, and maybe this could apply to you too, Mike...
I once asked Larry to mike some pistons for me to get some more input
on piston shape.... specifically diameter taper and deliberate
out-of-roundness.  I then dropped the ball and never sent him the
paperwork.  I have data for my Mahle's and also for my
Kolbenschmidt's, but the Mahle's are used, and were suspect for wear
/ collapse, although I am thinking that that is less and less likely.
  
   At any rate, the specs in the book and the Volkswagen repair books
that I have mention only the piston to cylinder clearance near the
skirt.   I replaced my Mahle's because of what I thought was
excessive taper toward the top, only to find that the brand-new
Kolbenschmidt's were almost the same.  If I could just get a couple
more sets of data, I could publish the results here on the list, and
people would have some comparison numbers for judging their own
pistons.
  I have two drawings which specifiy the places where diameter
measurements need to be made to be consistent with my data gathering
efforts.  There are ten measurements per piston, and to get a good
statistical sample, all four pistons should be measured, making a
total of 40 measurements.   I need them to .0001" if possible,
although .001" would still be very helpful.
   If I hear any volunteers out there, please respond with whether
you would like me to mail you the drawing forms, or attach them to
E-mail.   Since they are drawn in Microsoft's give-away paint
program, they are bit mapped files, and rather large.

					Thanks,
                                                            Jim T.
