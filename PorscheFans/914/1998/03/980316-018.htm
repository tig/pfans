Hi All,

    I may have an injector leaking so how do I check? I probaly
need to make sure my check valve is functioning in the fuel
pump (mine is a fairly new rebuilt). The reason why I wonder this
is my preasure comes up while cranking to 30psi then quickly
drops to 0psi when the fuel pump isn't running. What started
this all is my car suddenly died, I started it Sat. and it seemed
ok for about a minute then it died and I couldn't get it to
keep running. Since it died I put in the rotor, plug, and
air filter I recently bought for a tunup. No good still. If
my fuel pump check valve works and I can't find a leaking 
injector maybe its time to check the valves (I know this
won't affect the fuel preasure but maybe my problem is in
the valves). One other thing is just before the car dies even
if it seems to be idling fine in sputs (if you've work on a
914 you probably know what sputs sounds like) then dies and
won't start and idle again. Aaaaaaag! Man I was just getting
into nice weather! Is my approach ok or am I attacking this
problem the wrong way?
    Thanks

Josh, maybe for some gas money you might want to take a drive
to Loveland and pitch in???
