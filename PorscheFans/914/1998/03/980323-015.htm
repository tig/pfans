Hi Mike!

"   Ok!
I finally had the time to CC my heads after 2 weeks!

And the nominees for best CC in a Porsche 2.0 motor are...

#1	49.5
#2	49.0
#3	54.0
#4	54.0

I checked and the deck hieght, it's approx .034" /( .864 mm on my
feeler gauge), the cam is stock, the valves are stock 2.0 size,
pistons are supposed to be euro, the cylinders check out to 94 mm.

Pistons are supposed to be euro, but how do you tell?  (They have a
very slight dish in the top but are just about flat with no valve
cutouts).

Now I need to order shims to get me in the "slightly above stock"
compression range.
Don't want to get way up there, the car is driven mostly track,
sometimes street, but not a daily driver.  The motor is completely
stock 2.0 with FI.   "

   I'm not sure what you want here... I calculated for 8:1 and
8.5:1... 8:1 is stock Euro tune... you might want to get some other
opinions before going as high as 8.5:1, and I'd say anything over
8.5:1 is definitely a racing engine only.
 
"   With the 2 different heads, I imagine I'll need 2 dif. sizes of
shims.  I have MSHP standing by, just got to give them the right shim
size(s).   "

  Yes, you will.

	< way snipped >

> 1.  Desired Compression Ratio:
	"  What's stock? I want to go higher but not have to use super  "

  USA stock is 7.6:1... Euro stock is 8.0:1.... see above note for
values used.

> 2.  Piston Dish Volume:
	"  Almost nothing, 1cc? pistons are on the rods so it's just a
guess.  "

  I have Kolbenschmidt Euro pistons in my engine; their dish volume
was measured at 4 cc's.   If you have Kolbenschmidts also, then yours
are probably close to that value, but the only way to be sure is to
measure.  I have included calculations for your guess of 1 cc versus
my measured 4 cc's, and you will be astounded at the difference...
for the 54 cc chamber volumes, changing the piston dish from 1 to 4
cc's makes a .3 difference in compression ratio; while on the 49 cc
side, the same change in assumptions results in a .5 change... this
is more than the difference between Euro and USA configuration
engines!
  I don't see any help for it... you are going to have to stand the
engine on end and measure that dish volume to better than 1 cc
accuracy, or you're still guessing...

	"  Been there, done that. 49.5, 49.0, 54.0, 54.0  "

   Stock 2 litre stroke is 71mm; this is what I used.

  OK... here we go...

  For 8.0 to 1 compression ratio AND 4 cc piston dish volume:
     
                  49 cc head side:   CR no shims = 9.35 to 1;  
                                              shims for 8 to 1 = 
064"

                   54 cc head side:  CR no shims = 8.7 to 1;
                                              shims for 8 to 1 =
036"

  For  8.5 to 1 compression ratio AND 4 cc piston dish volume:

                    49 cc head side:  CR no shims = 9.35 to 1;
                                               shims for 8.5 to 1 =
038"

                     54 cc head side:  CR no shims = 8.7 to 1;
                                                shims for 8.5 to 1 =
009"

For 8.0 to 1 compression ratio AND 1 cc piston dish volume:
     
                  49 cc head side:   CR no shims = 9.8 to 1;  
                                              shims for 8 to 1 = 
081"

                   54 cc head side:  CR no shims = 9.1 to 1;
                                              shims for 8 to 1 =
053"

  For  8.5 to 1 compression ratio AND 1 cc piston dish volume:

                    49 cc head side:  CR no shims = 9.8 to 1;
                                               shims for 8.5 to 1 =
054"

                     54 cc head side:  CR no shims = 9.1 to 1;
                                                shims for 8.5 to 1 =
026"

   As you can see, the piston dish volume value is critical... if you
measure it, and also pick a compression ratio that you like, I can
run the numbers once, instead of 8 times.
