>(For those who refuse to use a pressure gauge)

>Due to the fact that most technicians do not want to take the time to

>Fuel does not come out of the test area...  Pressure is approx 0 psi
>Fuel hits the hood insulation...            Pressure is 5 - 8 psi
>Fuel squirts over the fender...             Pressure is 10-15 psi
>Fuel splashes off the fender onto the hood insulation
>and into the next repair bay...             Pressure is 25-30 psi
>Fuel squirts to the garage roof, all over the car,
>including the shop owner...                 Pressure is 30-50 psi

>VACUUM TEST
>"Rule of Thumb"

>Put thumb on vacuum hose leading to direct engine vacuum.

>Don't feel anything                   Change thumbs and re-test
>Still don't feel anything             Vacuum is very low to none.
>Hose has slight suction               1" to 5"
>Suction causes skin to wrinkle        5" to 8"
>Suction turns thumb blue              8" to 10"
>Suction creates hickey on thumb       10" to 12"
>Suction creates pain                  18" to 20"
>Suction will not release and begins to move toward
>index finger                          20" to 25"

>IGNITION VOLTAGE OUTPUT TEST
>
>Scopes may be inaccessible from time to time, so we at "Bubba's Garage"
>have come up with this here test for Ignition Output:
>
>1.Hold medium wrench in one hand, Sears wrench preferred for accuracy
>  of test 'cause other smooth wrenches are too slick for throwin'!
>
>2.With engine runnin', grab hold of the plug end of an ignition cable
>  with the other hand and hold on tight!
>
>3.This will more than likely cause you to throw wrench!  KV output
>  is based on how far the wrench wuz thrown!
>
>       10 feet =                 approx. 10,000 volts
>       20 feet =                 approx. 15,000 volts
>       30 feet =                 approx. 25,000 volts
>       Over 30 feet =            Caution!  Must be one of them new
>                                           dis-is-it ignition systems,
>                                           use bigger wrench and retest.

>WARNING! No side effects have been reported due to testing at this time
