I've spent lots of time trying to justify the cost, so here's what I've
learned.  The best source for ads I've found is Hemmings (the inch thick ads
magazine).  Typically a two post will run $1700-2400 the last time I looked; a
drawback for me of this type is that it puts over a ton on a square foot of
concrete and I doubt our garage floor would support that without digging
deeper than our 4" slab.

What I've been more tempted by is the "low lift" several manufacturers offer
for about $1200.  It's structure (viewed from the side) is parallelogram, has
a single ram across the diagonal and safety stops along the way, and it lifts
the car about 30 inches (just right for dropping the engine and most
everything else).  They're commonly used by tire stores for changing tires.
Now if someone had blueprints for such a beast . . .
