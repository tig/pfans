    The big drawback is that it costs a lot of money... Expect to
    pay $10K+ to do a decent conversion.

    A 2.2 or 2.4-liter engine isn't a "big six", and it won't hurt
    the 901 transmission.  In fact, the 901 transmission can handle
    up to around 300 HP, so long as you don't do drag-style standing
    starts.

    The '73 and earlier cars are exempt from smog inspections.  The
    74's will be exempt starting in the year 2004.
