I may be off-base here (happens a lot these days), but I expect the
mysterious 'agent' in question is simply the excessively slippery
quality of the oil itself.  

The 'S' that you describe is the typical failing of valve cover gaskets.
They always get sucked in along the bottom edge if the cover doesn't fit
as tight and snug as it should.  Fixes for this are 1.  glue the gaskets
to the covers or  2. weld on a few more metal tabs along the inside edge
of the cover, just like the one in the center on each side.  I haven't
tried this 2nd method yet, but plan to soon.
