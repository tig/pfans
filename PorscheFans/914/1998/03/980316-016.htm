Another thing to do when the tank is out is to check the 3 fiber like pads
that the tank rests on.  These seem designed to absorb water and rust the
tank in those spots.  When my tank was out I replaced these pads with
closed cell foam rubber.  I also cleaned the rusty spots on the tank and
used POR-15 on those spots.

Hi fourteeners,
Mike Cooley's method of removing the tank works well, but I cheated a bit.
I didn't jack the car up.  Instead, I cut the small line coming out of the
tank, and drained the fuel into a bucket, then replaced both hoses with
longer ones.
Keep these procedures handy, because you will eventually need to remove the
tank for swaybar installation, blower motor repair, wiper motor repair,
etc.
As always, working around fuel is dangerous.  Don't smoke.  Work in a
well-ventilated area.  Work-lights are dangerous--if they drop, they can
spark any spilled fuel or fuel fumes.  The last thing you need is to set
your car or house on fire.
You will need:
- fire extinguisher
- jerrycan of gas (to move car after tank is back in place :))
- new "under-tank" fuel lines, extra long.  I forget the size, I bought
them
after I removed the tank.
- a helper to help hold tank, and position bucket, etc.
- ice-cream bucket or large margarine tub or equivilant.
- fuel line clamp or needle-nose vise grips
- an environmentally friendly disposal place for your old fuel (coffee
filter+funnel+lawnmower works for me)
- filler neck gasket (maybe.  I re-used mine)
- 8mm socket or nut-driver
- large flat screwdriver for tank retaining strap
- med. flat screwdriver for fuel hose clamps (or socket-driver)
- razor knife (Olfa, X-acto, etc)
- large side-cutters (optional)
Removal:
1.  Fill a "jerrycan" with fresh gas and keep it handy.  This will help you
move the car afterwards :))
2.  Drive car until "gas light" comes on.  There usually is about a gallon
of gas left in the tank at this point.  You can use Mike Cooley's siphon
method instead, if you like, but then you have much more fuel to dispose
of.
In any case, get as much gas out of the tank as possible.
3.  Remove fuel tank filler neck, using your 8mm socket.  Remove expansion
tank, be careful with the gasket if you want to re-use it.  The fuel-level
sender lives below the expansion tank.   Un-plug the fuel level sender, and
tuck the wire and plug out of the way so that it doesn't get broken.
4.  Remove fuel-tank retaining strap from top of tank.  Lift fuel tank
partially out of car, using the filler neck hole as a handle.  Be careful
because there are 2 hoses under the tank that connect it to the car.  I had
a helper at this point, to help "man-handle" the fuel-tank.  It's not
heavy,
but really bulky.  I lifted the tank as high as I could, then lifted the
"driver's side" of the tank higher, to make as much room under the tank as
possible.  Try not to stress the fittings on the tank, or the hard-lines in
the car.
5.  When the tank is high enough, fit the ice-cream bucket down in the tank
cavity and drain the rest of the tank.  I used the vise-grips to clamp the
skinny line near the tank, and then snipped the skinny line.  Have the
clamps handy so that you can stop the flow before your bucket gets full, so
that you can pull it out without spilling too much.  When the tank is
completely empty, snip the other hose as well.
6.  Fuel hoses usually get stuck to the tank fittings, as well as to the
hard lines inside the car.  I carefully slice the hoses off, to prevent
damage to the fittings.  It is much easier to cut the hoses than to wiggle
them off.  Save yourself the grief.
[if required, please see Mike Cooley's posting for tips on how to clean &
repair your tank.  I'm told that a length of chain works well in "knocking
off" the loose rust inside the tank.  Simply insert and shake.  Be careful
of the baffles inside though.]
Replacement:
7.  You can now bring sections of both fuel lines to your FLAPS and buy new
pieces.  Regular fuel line works fine, there is very little pressure on the
hoses.  The big hose is a "gravity feed" to the pump, and the little one is
the return line.  If you replace the original short hoses with long ones (2
or 3 feet) it makes future work with the fuel tank much easier.  You
probably won't have to remove the hoses next time, or if you do, you can
leave the gas inside the tank (stand it on end.)  Don't make them too long,
or they won't fit back under the tank without crimping--a crimp in the hose
will starve the engine of fuel--ask me how I know :)
8.  When replacing the tank, tuck the hoses neatly underneath.  Make sure
that they clear the swaybar, and make sure that there are no crimps or
twists in the 2 lines.
9.  When "seating" the tank, check the rubber end-blocks because they
sometimes shift.  When the tank is properly seated, re-install the
hold-down
strap, the fuel sender, and filler neck.  Put your jerrycan of gas into the
tank, and check for leaks.  Run the car for 5 or 10 minutes to make sure
that you didn't accidentally crimp the fuel hoses.
Have fun.  It took me only 1/2 hour to remove & replace the tank, but much
longer to re&re the wiper linkage :(
