Very snazzy, but that would (for one thing) still be illegal under SCCA
Solo2 S/SP rules. The motor mounts are clearly altered. And in addition,
wouldn't that tend to lower the crossbar? Miking it neccessary to alter
the shift linkage? And if not lowered, then clearly the chassis would
have to be modified. And at that point, I don't think any set of rules
would allow the car to remain in a 'streetable' class. Just my $.02, I
could be wrong, wouldn't be the first time...
