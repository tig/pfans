Hey Jeff and teeners, 
I have ordered for them and know a few other people who have. Tom and
Wayne seem to have there shit together, maybe there where out of town,
chaseing parts, chaseing........ ?? I have never had a problem talking
to them or getting return calls. Have meet them out at Pomona several
times and there really cool.
Well ,  better luck next time, 
Don
