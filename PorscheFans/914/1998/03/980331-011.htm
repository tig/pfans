the further away from the head, the slower the ox sensor is to heat up. I ordered
a one wire fron CB proformance, they told me it would not work at idle (I'm
putting it in the collector). the three wire ones are to heat it up faster so that
it controls emmisions sooner. My 325i had a 3 wire, it was down by the cat
converter, my 630CS that I converted to Motronics uses a 1 wire because I put it
closwer to the head
