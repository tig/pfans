914ers,

As much as I hate to put a message on the list about brake bleeding
problems (specially since I responded to the last message that bleeding 914
brakes isn't that bad), I seem to be having a severe problem this time.
Almost the entire system was taken apart his Winter with the exception of
the master cylinder;  911 front calipers, 914 front calipers on the rears
and new stainless brake lines.  

We have been trying to bleed the brakes for the past two days, with not
much luck.  I have run completely new fluid through the entire system a
couple of times, but every time I move to the next cylinder, the pedal hits
the floor on the first 2-3 pumps, and it never really gets hard.  I've
checked all my connections, no leaks.  I definately don't have any air
coming out of the lines now.  I did however check the master cylinder at
the pedal cluster, and it seems to be leaking a little.  There is a small
amount of fluid at the bottom of the cluster tray that I know wasn't there
when I rebuilt the cluster last year.  Could my problem be the 25 year old
seals in the MC finally gave up?  I've been wanting to upgrade to a 19mm
unit anyway, maybe now's the time.

Anyone have a 19 mm master cylinder for sale?

Thanks in advance,

Dion

(3 weeks to the first race, and I have no brakes!)
