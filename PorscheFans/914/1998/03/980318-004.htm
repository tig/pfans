I'm not 100% positive that it does matter, but if at all possible, inspect
the wires.  They should have numbers on them, and you can then compare them
to the numbers on the MPS to make sure that everything is lined up
correctly.  In my case, I didn't have any numbers, so I had to open up the
MPS and trace the wires back from there.
