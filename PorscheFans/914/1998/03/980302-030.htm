A hip young man goes out and buys a 1973 Porsche 914 and installs a
racing 917 Porsche 12 cyl. aircooled engine.  It is the fastest car
available in the world, costing about $500,000.

He takes it out for a spin and while stopping for a red light, an old
man on a moped (both looking about 90 years old) pulls up next to him.
The old man looks over the sleek, shiny surface of the car and asks,
"What kind of car ya' got there, sonny?"

The young man replies, "A 1973 Porsche 914 with a 917 engine. It cost me
about a half million dollars!"

"That's a lot of money," says the old man, shocked.  "Why does it cost
so much?"

"Because this car can do up to 230 miles an hour!" states the cool dude
proudly.

The moped driver asks, "Can I take a look inside?"

"Sure," replies the owner.

So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around. Leaning
back on his moped, the old man says, "That's a pretty nice car, all
right!"

Just then the light changes so the guy decides to show the old man what
his car can do.  He floors it, and within 20 seconds the speedometer
reads 230 mph. Suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear view  mirror.  It
seems to be getting closer! He slows down to see what it  could be and
suddenly, whhhoooossshhh!  Something whips by him, going  much faster!  
"What on earth could be going faster than my 914?!"   the young man asks
himself.  Then, ahead of him, he sees a dot cooming toward him.
Whoooooosh!  It goes by again, heading the opposite  direction!  And it
almost  looked like the old man on the moped!

"Couldn't be," thinks the guy. "How could a moped outrun a 12 cyl 914?!"
Again, he sees a dot in his rear view mirror! Whooooosh Ka-BbblaMMM!
It plows into the back of his car, demolishing the rear end.  The young
man jumps out, and it IS the old man!!!  Of course, the moped and the
old man are hurting for certain.  

He runs up to the old man and says, "You're badly hurt!  Is there
anything I can do for you?"

The old man moans and replies, "Yes,  Unhook my suspenders from your
side-view mirror!"
