Hey gang,

The last time I posted I was sweating a huge oil leak after my second run
in last Sunday's autocross here in Atlanta.

Well, I crawled under the car and started peering around and noticed that
I could see the end of the crankshaft between the front of the engine and
the fan shroud. What had happened was, the bolt holding the mount for the
fan on the crankshaft had backed out. The "bzzzt" I had heard half way
through that run was the fan coming to a stop inside the fan housing.
Upon disassembly I found the remains of the shear pin thingy (I forgot
the name of it) welded inside the mount. This mount also serves as the
race inside the front oil seal, that's why the oil was leaking.

Luckily I have another engine disassembled so I put another mount and pin
on the crankshaft and I've got the fan back on the engine. Tomorrow night
I should get it running again after remounting the front engine tin and
putting the shift rod back on (I had to take the shift rod off to get the
fan out of the car).

Alright, already, I've had enough of the unique weirdo problems that no
one else seem to have. Remind me sometime to tell y'all about the time
the nose of my crankshaft broke off back in 1988.
