40mm sounds about right for mine, but my mechanic pulled my studs out of a
set of old 911 heads, so I doubt they're the same.  Regarding the timeserts,
I seem to recall that you don't insert the timesert into the head with the
stud, you use a special tool.  The special tool actually causes the timesert
to expand into the threads in the head... does that sound right?
