Thanks Josh for the info. So, if these things are not very precise from the
manufacturer, is it difficult to calibrate them and how would you do it?

I'm thinking that I'm not going to have it permenently mounted in the
exhaust, but install it for diagnostics only. For this, a simple voltmeter
will suffice. My main reason for wanting one (for all of my cars) is to get
through state emissions testing. It bugs the heck out of me that I can't
directly measure HC and CO without having to buy an expensive pro type
tester. I've never seen a cheap (100$) probe type tester that I could stick
up the tailpipe before getting rejected at the testing station. I certainly
can't go to the station and make adjustments while the operator continually
retests. So, an oxy sensor is the next best thing and as close as I can get
for a low amount of money. I'll just put a bolt in the threaded hole in the
exhaust pipe when I'm done testing. 

Dirk Wright, not certified, but definitely certifiable!
