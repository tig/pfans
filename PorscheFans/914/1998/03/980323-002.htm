Ok!
I finally had the time to CC my heads after 2 weeks!
Lots of business, El Nino cleared, went to a road race at Sears point, =
and there was too much yardwork to catch up on here in Sunny CA!

And the nominees for best CC in a Porsche 2.0 motor are...

#1	49.5
#2	49.0
#3	54.0
#4	54.0

I checked and the deck hieght, it's approx .034" /( .864 mm on my feeler =
gauge), the cam is stock, the valves are stock 2.0 size, pistons are supp=
osed to be euro, the cylinders check out to 94 mm.

Note: Used the plexi method,(JJ's) and salad oil. Measured each one 3 tim=
es. The 1&2 head was redone by MSHP while the 3&4 head was not.  I purcha=
sed this 2.0 motor used, and the top end had recently been "rebuilt".  =
I cleaned up the heads and thought I had a small crack between the valves=
 on #3 so I sent it out to MSHP.  The 1&2 head looks fine, but not as cle=
an and spiffy as the 3&4 head.  Pistons are supposed to be euro, but how =
do you tell?  (They have a very slight dish in the top but are just about=
 flat with no valve cutouts).

Now I need to order shims to get me in the "slightly above stock" compres=
sion range.
Don't want to get way up there, the car is driven mostly track, sometimes=
 street, but not a daily driver.  The motor is completely stock 2.0 with =
FI.
With the 2 different heads, I imagine I'll need 2 dif. sizes of shims. =
 I have MSHP standing by, just got to give them the right shim size(s).

"I'd like to thank in advance, my high school drama teacher, my director,=
 Leonardo, and most importantly, all the supporting cast and crew, for =
without them, none of this would be possible.  Many, many thanks!"

>   Here's what is necessary in the way of raw data:
>
> 1.  Desired Compression Ratio:
	What's stock? I want to go higher but not have to use super
> 2.  Piston Dish Volume:
	Almost nothing, 1cc? pistons are on the rods so it's just a guess.
> 3.  Combustion Chamber Volume:
	Been there, done that. 49.5, 49.0, 54.0, 54.0
> 4.  Deck Height (Measured in Inches):
	.034"
> 5.  Head Gasket Thickness (Measured in Inches):
	As suggested by members of the audience, Zero!
> 6.  Your Engine's Bore (In mm):
	94mm
> 7.  Your Engine's Stroke (In mm):
	Stock.  but no idea what it would be.
>
>    With the above data, I will return to you a shim thickness in mm
> and inches to reduce your compression from it's maximum possible
> value to your desired value.
