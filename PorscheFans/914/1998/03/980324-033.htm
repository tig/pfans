Hi Dave!

  You asked:

  The timing marks aren't on the pulley, unless you added them.  They
are on the edge of the fan, which means that you can't see them
without a mirror (unless you insert practically your entire body into
the engine compartment, jam your head against the firewall, and look
back towards your navel).  This is why many people add timing marks
to the fan pulley rim, but you have to do this using the ones on the
opposite side of the hole as a reference.  Dave Darling has a
shortcut method where he just counts fan blades over form TDC, or
something... this will certainly get you in the ball park.   If you
want to be exact, you will probably have to remove the fan from the
engine, and generate any missing timing marks from whatever you can
find as a reference.

  Here's a procedure for this from my files:


  I am pretty sure that all 914 fans are identical in size,
differing only in timing mark configuration.  With this 
in mind, the following should allow you to mark your fan,
providing you can get a caliper onto it.  I made the 
following measurements with the fan held in my hand; the
engine was out of the car and apart.  If you need to translate
the chord distances into circumferential distances, the
diameter of my old fan is 8.765 inches.  This measurement is
an arithmetic sum of three measurements, owing to the
limitations of my dial caliper:  the distance from the edge
of the shaft hole to the edge of the fan: 3.845", the 
distance from the shaft hole to the edge of the fan
diametrically opposite the first measurement: 3.850", and
the diameter of the shaft hole (smallest step): 1.070".

 The TDC mark is supposed to be a 0 stamped into the fan edge.  
Since the 0 is a pretty wide mark, the measurement is going
to be fuzzy, but here goes:

  Distance (CHORD, not circumferential) between 27 degree mark
and TDC mark:
   Distance to NEAR edge of 0: 2.035 inches.
   Distance to Far edge of 0:   2.110 inches.
          Width of 0 character:  .075 inches.
   Calculated distance to TDC is 2.073 inches.

  Distance from 27 degreees before TDC mark to 5 degrees
before TDC mark:

   Measured distance:
 (CHORD, not circumferential):  1.630 inches.

   Check distance:  Measured distance from TDC 0 to 5 degree
 mark:
          Measured distance to NEAR edge of 0:  .440 inches.
          Measured distance to FAR edge of 0:  .515 inches.
          Calculated distance to TDC:  .478  inches.

  These measurements were made using a dial caliper... 
therefore the distances are CHORD distances, i.e. straight
line distances between the marks, NOT as you would measure 
with a tape wrapped around the fan.  I first tried using the 
inside diameter points on the back of the caliper. but found 
that the readings were inconsistent due to the shape of the 
points and the shape of the notches being different.  I found
that the most consistent (and I hope, accurate) readings were
done by laying the main caliper jaws flat on the rim of the 
fan, and eye-balling the center of the notches past the edge 
of the caliper jaws.  Most timing mark uses are not super 
critical, so I hope that this will allow you to get close 
enough.
                                        Good Luck,
                                        Jim T.
