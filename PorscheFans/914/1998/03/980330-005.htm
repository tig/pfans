That is indeed a bad thing. Did you try adding resistance in the HT circuit,
as is commonly done? The resistance of that sensor goes down with temp, so
adding a fixed resistance would just shift the curve towards a richer mixture. 

I think this charactistic you are experiencing may be the result of a design
compromise. I may be wrong, but I think that NTC (negative temperature
coefficient) thermisters don't have a "shelf" in thier response. They are
just linearly related to temperature.

I have patent #3,570,460 here. It says that the ecu detects engine speed and
shuts off the fuel supply when the throttle is closed and the engine speed
is above idle. "The circuit is arranged to block the transmission of the
opening pulses in case of speeds exceeding the idling speed while the
accelerometer {sic} pedal is not depressed."
