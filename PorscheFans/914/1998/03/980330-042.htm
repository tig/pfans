Ooops, someone just told me about the bug in the mailer.  My apologies if 
anyone gets this message more than once.
According to some friends who have emailed me, you should never reference 
more than one list in the To: section.  This will cause major problems from 
what I hear.
Well, sorry, and send your stories anyways!!!

Original Message:
Hi there everyone again.  I've created a new section on our website just 
for people to share their stories about life, love and the thrill of 
driving a Porsche.  I would be honored if you would help us to build our 
community and our site by contributing your story.  Nothing will be edited 
or changed...
Please email me if you have any to share.  Also check out the one story 
that someone has put up there.  It's a bit humorous if you ask me...
Many thanks,
Wayne
