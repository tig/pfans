Boy, this sounds all too familiar.  With mine, it turned out to be that I
had a rotor without a resistor, and once a rotor with a resistor was
installed, the bucking went away.  The more common cause of this behavior is
the throttle position switch, though.  To test it, simply unplug it.  You'll
notice that acceleration is diminished with the TPS disconnected, but if the
bucking goes away, then at least you know the cause.  It may just be out of
alignment, or it may need to be cleaned up or replaced.

Hope this helps!
