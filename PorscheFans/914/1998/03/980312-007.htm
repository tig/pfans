Hi everyone.

I think someone may have had a similar problem to this a while ago.

I have some gremlin in my D-Jet that is intermitently dumping fuel into
my engine. It will be running fine, then suddenly run rough, with huge
clouds of white smoke (smoke that smells of unburned gas-not oil), and I
assume enough gas is getting past the rings to dilute the oil because
suddenly I have loads of oil blowing out of the oil-filler vent.

Then, as quickly as it comes, it goes, and the power is back, after a
minute the smoke stops, and my gas milage goes back to normal.

It has been happening for a few minutes at a time, though on Saturday it
was bad enough that I went through 13 gallons of gas in 95 miles!

I'm assuming that it is electrical, because when it runs rough I can
hear some interference on my radio.

Also it affects both side of the engine, based on the smoke from both
sides of my exhaust.

My questions are: 
Can the FI trigger points fail in the closed position?
If the cold start injector were to stick open, could it possibly pump
that much gas?

I've tried disconnecting the throttle position switch and the cold start
injector, but to no avail.

Any ideas??? 
Thanks.
