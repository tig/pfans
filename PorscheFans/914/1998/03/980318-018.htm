Jack,

Couple of tough choices, and a couple of options.

The 1.8 is the wrong motor.  They were only found in '74 and '75
cars.  That part doesn't matter, but (almost) none of the 2.0 parts
will fit the 1.8.

The '73 2.0 is the more "diserable" car.  Especially to Californians,
as the '73 is exempt from smog testing, and the '74 is not.

While the 2.0 parts won't fit on the 1.8 motor, the 2.0 motor will
fit in the '71 car.  The '73 transmission is better, but it's not
as easy to move over; the linkage is different.

If it were me, I'd sell the '71, and use the money to fix the '73.
Or better yet, sell both, and start over (or mayby go to Otto's!)

But what makes more sense is to sell the '73, find a "correct" 1.7
for the '71 (I see then for $200 every now and then).  The purists
will be happy, because that make two 914's that aren't hacked.

$.02
Gary.
