The original plugs, maybe what you still have, are rather stiff plastic
hemisphers with a narrow slit. The theory was water spray from below
wouldn't find its way through the slit, but water would drain out. As we
all know, junk easily plugs the plug. I finally forgot to put mine back
in and have lived happily ever after. What little water does splash in
dries a lot faster that the standing water that used to be there. My
advice: take em out, treat the area for rust and paint it real well.
Then leave them out.
