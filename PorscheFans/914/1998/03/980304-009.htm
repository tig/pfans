Subject: Air Pump Maintenance and Care (for '75&'76 914 Owners)

     Some Tips and Advice on the feeding and care of 914/4 Air/Emissions 
     Pumps for '75/'76 Model Years:
     
     1)  NEVER NEVER NEVER turn your engine over by putting a wrench on  
           the (very convenient to reach) nut on the end of the 
           Air/Emissions Pump's drive pulley!
     
        Of course I did and broke something very expensive (and 
        basically not obtainable)  The drive pulley is linked (via belt) 
        to a driven pulley which is situated along the centerline of the 
        Fan and Crankshaft.  This "driven" pulley is connected to the 
        Fan's hub via a small steel bracket.  This bracket is attached 
        to the Driven Pulley by a Vulcanized Rubber Isolator.  This 
        Isolator will tear off the steel bracket (or simply in two) if 
        you apply torque sufficient to turn over your engine.
     
        The fix????  Used parts: not a good solution since they all have 
        20+ year old rubber and are waiting to rip.  Besides, any source 
        I've found wants $200-$300 for a "rebuilt" one, and $100 for a 
        used one.  The few "suppliers" of this part know you are one of 
     only aprox 20-30K 914 owners for '75/'76 and that you can't go 
     anywhere else for the part. Hiway robbery, no debate!!
     
     What did I do? Machined an Aluminum "substitute" for the rubber, 
     made the appropriate changes to the mating parts, and 
     loc-tite/screwed it all together.  Yes it is noisy, yes my roller 
     bearings will probably fail prematurely if my balance wasn't 
     perfect, and yes, I passed smog.
     
     
     2) "Frozen" Smog Pumps:  Another great reason to use your 914 on a 
        regular basis.  These things corrode up simply from inactivity.  
        They are made of an Aluminim alloy and a few steel parts and 
        other metals which make for lovely galvanic action.  A little 
        moist air and inactivity and toast!!  Not necessarily Dead 
        however.  
        Take it apart  CAREFULLY.  Found lots of un-nameable goo inside. 
        Be careful, 
        the rotor inside has carbon lining on its tips which form a 
        sliding seal inside the pump.  Don't knick or damage these.  
        Clean carefully (I used detergent and water and LIGHT sanding).  
        Make the inside part pretty, clean and renew the lubricant only 
        where you see traces of the old one.  I forget where and what 
        was lubricated, but it will be obvious when you crack yours    
        open.  Reassemble, install and run engine.  Put your hand on the 
        outlet while running engine and feel that air flow once again.
     
        Alternates to repair:  this pump is a Japanese (OEM) supplied 
        unit that probably was used in tons of Toyotas, Nissans Etc in 
        '75/'76.  I'm sure a reasonably priced rebuild or new part can 
        be found readily if you can't "repair" your own.
     
     3) Feed Hose: from pump to injector "rail".  Make sure this hose is 
        supple and without cracks.  Replace it often and put a good hose 
        clamp on both ends to keep it tight.  Pressurized air is trying 
        to make its way out and you don't want a silly air leak to screw 
        up you smog check.
     
     
     4) Poor Man's Supercharger..let's see, you take 8 of these in 
        parallel, attach to intake and...........OK. OK Good luck with 
        air pump care and feeding.
