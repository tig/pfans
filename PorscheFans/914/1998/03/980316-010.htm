One word of caution: when pulling the fuel lines loose under neath the
tank, make sure the drop light is far away! One of life's longest moments
was the time I was under mine with one of those cheap droplights, pulling a
fuel hose off and splashed some gasoline on the hot light bulb. If the bulb
had shattered like they usually do, I probably would not be here today.
