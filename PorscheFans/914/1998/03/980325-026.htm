This is something I'm still trying to figure out, though had other concerns
lately.

Mine is a 73, the gauge has the 2 separate indicators, but they both blink
together.  This didn't change when I went through the entire wiring system
and cleaned up the contacts.  Solved all other electrical gremlins but
this.

The circuit is a little weird, looking at the Haynes diagram for the USA
73.  Can anyone describe exactly what should be happening in the components
for the turn signal lights.  It looks like they vary (or should vary the
ground for the lights).

Hi Bill!
You asked:
> I got a question.  My signal indicators blink brightly once on the
side
> I have on and then both of them blink dimly together.  I kind of
thought
> it was normal for both indicators to blink when signaling but have
> gathered otherwise from comments on this list.  Ideas?
  It depends on what year car you have... there are a few '74 year
cars, like mine, that have '73 instruments (two turn signal arrows)
but '74 wiring (one indicator) so that they blink together.  The
earlier cars had seperate arows for left and right, and the later
'74's and later cars had a single round indicator in the tach at
about 10:00 o'clock, as I recall from my brief stint behind the wheel
of Dave Darling's car.
  It sounds as though you have a '73 or earlier car, which should
have independent signaling.   The usual checks apply:  check all four
corners of the car to be sure that all the external lights are
working correctly; most turn signal systems produce all sorts of
screwy results with one or more lamps out.   Be sure to check that
all of the light fixtures have good grounds, and that all the bulbs
are seated correctly, with no corrosion in the sockets.
                         Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
