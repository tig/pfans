Yeah, I just looked it up in my Marks Handbook. I don't know if ISO has a
similar standard to the ANSI ones.

The one loose one I have is threaded all the way down. These instersect the
valve guides however, so they would be easier to thread all the way through
before the valve is guide is inserted. I don't know about the set on the
opposite side. I screwed my loose one all the way down and the threads got
nice and tight before it hit bottom. Of course, then the stud didn't extend
far enough out to be any use. I'm thinking about just getting a longer stud
for a simple solution. I did buy the SS studs based on the OEM ones that I
removed. So, they are only threaded into the head for about 10mm or so,
which seems low to me for stud that extends about 38mm out of the head. 

I replaced the studs for the intake manifold, and they were tough to turn
both the old one coming out and the new one going in. I still think that VW
uses some other class of fit for these studs, they are just too tough to
turn to be a regular thread type. 

On the rear housing for the transmission, the 2 studs that hold the exhaust
hanger on my transmission were bunged up. One had been replaced with a bolt,
and the other one had a nut frozen to the stud, so they came out together.
The thing sat for a while outdoors like that, and I noticed a substantial
amount of something strange either growing in the holes, or corrosion -
whatever. I cleaned them up good and attempted to install some replacements.
It took a lot of torque to turn the studs and I became afraid I would strip
the soft magnesium, so I got out my M8 tap and cleaned up the holes. They
screwed in like regular nuts (loose) after that, so I had to make sure they
bottomed out to make them tight. The Germans have some kind of process for
installing these studs in aluminum and magnesium alloys, I'm certain,
because they are all tough to turn. 

Dirk Wright, not certified, but definitely certifiable!
