Boy are you cynical today Dirk!  8^)

On the positive side, I took Friday off from work to take advantage of the
70+ degree weather in Northern Ohio.  And spent the entire day in the garage.

One of my tasks was to install the adjustable swaybar that I bought last

removing the gas tank.

To my surprise, the tank was clean, and the handy shop vac was all that was
needed under the tank to reveal clean, original paint!
