 I, too was / am very impressed with their web site, and intended to
order from them, or at least check out whether or not what I wanted
existed.  I, too, got the answering machine during normal business
hours, and no call back.   I'm not too upset about that, because I
don't think that what I wanted exists, but as a business practice,
this creates a very bad impression.    I, for one,  absolutely and
catagorically refuse to place a credit card number on the internet,
so if I can't speak to someone in person, I don't order.   E-mail
ordering is not a viable option for me.

  My general rule of thumb is:  never do business with any firm that
does not have a manned daytime phone number.  This usually is an
indication of "Fly-By-Night, Inc.".  The only reason that I'm willing
to give Pelican another try is because of their excellent web site.  
Web pages and customer contact protocols are important indicators of
the reliability of a company, and whether or not it is a good idea to
do business with them.  Normally, the two are consistent; i.e. when
you get bad telephone service, you will also find poor customer
relations in general, and a useless or non-existent web site.   In
this case, we have a firm that has bent over backwards to create a
useful and informative web site which is in itself an excellent
example of customer service.   However, the same company won't answer
it's telephone, or return calls!   The contradiction is one that I
have not encountered before, and that I am uncertain how to react to.


  I look forward to hearing Pelican's reply to these problems on this
list so I can figure out how to order, or if I really want to.   Just
my $.02.

					Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
