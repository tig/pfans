O.K. it's been almost 6 months now that I have had my '74 2.0 and there are
still 2 things that still don't make sense to me (probably more but that is all
I can think of right now).
There is a 'tub' on either side of the front of the engine compartment (in
front of the battery and in front of the relay panel) which have drains and are
supposed to have removably plugs in them.  On my car the drains are open so
that the water can get out.  When my drains were plugged (with debris) I would
collect a couple of inches of standing water in there.  Question is, if the
drains are supposed to be plugged, how is the water supposed to get out of
there?
2nd thing that doesn't make sense to me is the passenger side warm air guide.
The way I understand that the engine is supposed to cool is by bringing in cool
air through the fan and blowing it up over the top of the motor where it is
forced down through the cylinder fins and out the bottom.  If the warm air
guides are installed, it blocks most of the path for this hot air to get out
the bottom of the motor.  On the driver's side it seems necessary because the
thermostat bellows is right above it and cool air from below the car could
cause it to never warm up (and open the flaps) unless a hot air 'pocket' is
created.  But I don't understand it's purpose on the passenger side - it seems
like it would make the engine run hotter.

Thanks!
