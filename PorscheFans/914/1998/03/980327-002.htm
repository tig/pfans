For 914 models, there are currently several in production. All except the
official Porsche factory models should be available through EWA Cars
(www.ewacars.com) or your local hobby shop that carries these brands. The
official Porsche factory models should be available through any Porsche
dealer -- but I know that Stoddard Imported Cars and Automobile Atlanta have
done a good job of keeping them in stock.

Listed in order of my preference in quality and detail. All are mostly metal
with plastic details and come pre-assembled (ready to play with). All are
based on the 69-73 style 914.

Detail Cars (about $26-30 each)
1:43 scale (about 3.5" long), highly detailed, exterior and interior very
accurate, no moving parts except the wheels, includes many tiny details like
the trunk lock, side view mirror, and authentic VW-type wheels).
	DET 340 Street version with open top, in red
	DET 341 Street version with open top, in silver
	DET 342 Street version with open top, in green
	DET 343 Street version with hardtop on, yellow
	DET 344-346	Wide fender race versions

MiniChamps (about $26-30 each)(don't have one of these yet, but based on the
pictures I've seen and other models of this brand, they should be pretty
good.)
1:43 scale (about 3.5" long), highly detailed, exterior and interior pretty
accurate
	930 65661 Street version, top off, orange
	930 65662 Street version, top off, green

Porsche (official factory model, made by GAMA, $17-30 depending where you
buy)
Listed as 1:43 scale, but actually measures to 1:40 scale (about 4" long),
moderately detailed but proportions are somewhat off, interior not accurate,
headlights pop-up from lever underneath, front and rear trunks open, hard
top removable and can be stowed in the rear trunk [nice touch].
	WAP 020 009 Street version, orange
	Best price I've seen is about $17 at Stoddard's (www.stoddard.com).

For the 25th anniversary of the 914, Porsche put out a special '25 Jahre
914' edition of the Porsche factory model. It is identical to the regular
versions except for the wheels (slightly closer to accurate, but no so you'd
really notice) and the box (silver with '25 Jahre 914' instead of the
regular black box with '914'). This is one to pursue only if you really
gotta have it for your collection. The only place I know may still have any
would be Automobile Atlanta (www.autoatlanta.com). As I remember, their
price was close to $50 for this collector's item.

Solido (about $15 each)
1:43 scale (about 3.5" long), marginally detailed, most parts heavily
simplified [windshield is a single clear plastic piece, roll bar is a single
black plastic piece], good proportions, headlights pop-up from lever
underneath, rear trunk opens, officially described as a 914/6 though no
detail on the model shows it any different than a 914/4.
	Was available from EWA, but I no longer see it listed in their catalog.

Happy model hunting!
Derek (73 914 2.0, Atlanta GA)
