Cool, I'd like to hear the results.  That is the same spot in my Bursch
exhaust that I brazed the bung into for the same reasons.  Now I know which
wires are which on my O2 sensor so I just have to get the exhaust back on,
wires run and the gauge hooked up.  That's going to be a week or two
though.

If you can post what kind of readings you see with your gauge and the
equivalent stoichiometric reading I compare to my gauge ( a Cyberdyne gauge
that has the colored LED bar.  The instructions tell which LEDs are for
stoichiometric ranges.)

Thanks,
Jeff

Hey all,
     Well, the O2 sensor has been installed, tomorow I'll mount the gauge
and see how it works. For those interested, here's what I can tell you
so far.
     The sensor is mounted into the Bursch collector just upstream of the
muffler in the 180 degree bend of the last pipe. This allows easy access
while still keeping it out of the way of debris or other such stuff. It
is a three wire variety (+12, GRND, and signal). The ground wire I have
mounted to the rear ground at the tranny (shorter wire, easier to
install), the hot wire and signal wire I have running into the passenger
compartment (Dave, remeber those extra wires we installed? :). So the
hot wire will go to switched power, which is just fine, and probably be
used to bring power to the display as well. And the signal, well that's
obvious.
     The display is a single digit resolution LCD display which seems to be
about 1.5x3 inches in size, nice and big. It reads out raw voltage from
the sensor. O2 sensors have an output of 0-1V, 0.5 being stoichiometric
(14.7). The designer of this system has told me that the best settings
will be around 0.4 or 0.5 for freeway cruising, and closer to 0.7 for
racing. He felt that the big single digit would be the best as A) that's
really all the resolution any sensor can provide, and B) that's all one
is going to remeber in the 'heat of battle' anyway. The 3-wire sensor is
faster, and more accurate, but does not have a very wide dynamic range.
So if the engine is either very lean or very rich, it won't yield a
reliable signal. That's ok though anyway, if it's that bad, there'll be
other symptoms as well I'm sure. This also means that the 0-1V range for
the 3 wire will yield a higher resoltion that a two wire will.
     It seems that all said and done, it took about 2-3 hours to install,
and the hardware itself will cost about $140.
