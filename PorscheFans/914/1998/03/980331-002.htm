Well fellow teeners I finally picked up my 914 from my friends shop. It had
been there for just over three months. A majority of this was spent in
storage. I should be excited and ready to drive..... but I noticed my
passenger door seemed a little tight and the drivers door seemed to drop a
little after opening. I thought maybe it was my eyes but after stepping back
and looking at it for a moment it really is sagging in the middle. So the
question is how big a project is this and how muh should I expect to spend to
fix this right? I dont want to Mickey Mouse this, the PO had doen enough of
that before...So does anyone have any words of advice, perhaps been down this
road before and can let me know what to expect I would appreciate it. 

Thanks In Advance
