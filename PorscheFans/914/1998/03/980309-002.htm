I had something funny happen to me this weekend...



I was just putting the finishing touches on the installation of a CranCams HI-6 and
PS92 coil.  Everything was going smoothly.  It started nice, idled great, and seemed
to be running all around much better.  The real test will be when I get her on the
road.  



The last thing I wanted to do was set the timming.  Just then it began to drizzle.
 Not one to let a little thing like rain (or dark, or freezing cold) bother me, I
threw a plastic tarp over the engine compartment and ducked under to do the timing.
 First I set the rev limiter to 3500.  I started her up, disconnected the throttle
spring and procedded to rev up the engine.



I have never really been aware how much air an engine really does suck, but I learned
that day...  The plastic tarp proceeded to get sucked in all araound me, until I
felt like a srink wrapped chicken.  This effect of restricted air, caused the carb
to suck more gas (like a big choke) and cause the rpms to climb, making the situation
worse.  In a split second I thought..what interesting headlines this would make.."Man
Suffocated by Car"  Once I came to my senses, I ditched the tarp and, decided to
get a little wet.  If I really came to my senses, I would have waited untill it stopped
raining, but that would be too sensable.
