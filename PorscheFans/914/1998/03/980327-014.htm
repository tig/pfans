	I've had some bucking between 2000-2500 RPM recently.  I didn't
feel like taking the throttle switch off my throttle body, so I just
lived with it for a while.  It got worse, and unplugging the switch did
indeed fix the problem.  (Backfired on decel, though!)
	Last night I dug into my spare parts, and brought out a dual-
vaccuum-port throttle body.  Wow, I thought I only had the singles in my
collection of spares!  Cool...
	It was grotty and filthy beyond belief.  I used almost a FULL
CAN of carb cleaner on it, to remove the gummy black caked-on goo.  I
checked the throttle switch on it, and verified the function.  This AM,
before I came to work, I swapped throttle bodies.  Yes, indeed, the
bucking is now gone.  Yaaaay!  I do have a new vaccuum leak somewhere--
most likely between the throttle body and the plenum.  That's OK, I did
get the idle down just about to normal.  I'll order a new TPS today and
then put my own throttle back on my car next week.
	Happy happy, joy joy!  Now if only I could fix that lean hunt
during part of the warm-up cycle...
