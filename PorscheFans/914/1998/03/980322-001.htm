Hi fourteener's
A couple of thoughts on the 1.8 engine and a question. First the thought. It
seems that almost everyone on the list has either a 1.7 or 2.0 with D
jetronic. Seems to be a lot of problems with the "D" system. I have had very
few problems with the "L" jetronic over the past 24 years. Now the question.
Why did porsche drop the 1.7 and build the 1.8 with the L system and still
retain the D system for the 2.0 engine. I of course understand that the 1.8
puts out less horsepower than the 1.7. Why did they build the 1.8. If the D
system was retained for the 2.0, why not  use  the same system on  the 1.8?

While I'm on my soap box, Why is a 914 NARP when the 924 has an audi engine
and transmission? The world wants to know
