Great, thanks, send me the spreadsheet and I will try to put it somewhere 
on the site where it will be useful.

You are correct, and I did indeed make a dopey mistake.  All my numbers 
should be divided by 4, as I forgot to take the volume per cylinder last 
night.  I will have to look at my rough calcs of the dish size on the 
Mahles, though.  The dish volume I estimated then is way too high...

Thanks,

-Wayne

Hi Wayne!

  I got the numbers via the time-honored process of "cc-ing" the
heads... that is, measuring the volume by injecting liquid (in my
case water) into the combustion chambers until filled, using a large
lab syringe calibrated in cc's.   This is also the technique used to
measure the piston dish volume.   Fortunately, the pistons always
seem to be either dished to varying degree or flat.   If domed
pistons were ever encountered, it would be necessary to take a clay
impression of the dome, and measure the volume of the resulting
depression... then incorporate it into the calculations as a negative
volume.

  The numbers work out to be about 60 cc's for each combustion
chamber, and about 4 cc's for the volume of each piston dish
(Kolbenschmidt Euro).   The reason that I am assuming that 60 cc's is
a standard chamber volume is that the Kolbenschmidt Euro pistons are
speced at 8 to 1 compression, and if I use standard head gasket
thickness, no shims, and the above values, the numbers work out to
about 7.9+ to 1... very close indeed.

13cc.

   I am having a bit of difficulty with the size of these numbers.
My understanding is that compression ratio = delta-volume, or change
in volume.   In other words, one takes all the fixed volumes -
combustion chamber volume, volume due to deck height, volume due to
head gasket thickness (if used), volume due to piston dish, and
volume due to cylinder shims (if any), and adds this total to the
swept volume, which is the area of a circle with diameter equal to
bore multiplied by the stroke.  This grand total volume is divided by
the swept volume only, which gives the change in volume expressed as
a dimensionless number with a denominator of one.   This number is
the compression ratio.
   A quick estimate in my head tells me that if I use 250 cc's as the
fixed volume (your number for combustion chamber volume rounded off),
adding this to the swept volume for one cylinder (roughly 2 litres /
4, or 500 cc) gives me a total volume of 750 cc.   Dividing this by
the rough swept volume of 500 cc gives a CR of  1.5 to 1.   This
sounds a bit low to me.
   I note that most of your numbers are close to measured values when
divided by four... are you calculating for all four cylinders at
once?   Normally, the cylinders are calculated individually, and a
compromise shim thickness value is chosen so that the spacing on both
cylinders on the same side of the engine will be equal.   This allows
for considerable variation from side to side.   For example, in Mike
Mueller's case (I am doing the calculations for him, as he does not
have a copy of Excell), he has had extensive head work done on one
head only.   As a result, his combustion chamber volumes vary by
about 5 cc's from side to side, so he will end up with considerably
thicker shims on one side than the other.

   I have put together an Excell spread sheet which does all the
calculation for you, provided only that you supply it with seven
initial parameters:  The compression ratio that you want, the
measured combustion chamber volume, the deck height in inches
(measured with no cylinder shims), the thickness of head gasket
rings, if used, the measured volume of the piston dish, if present,
and the bore and stroke of your engine.

  The spread sheet will produce the current compression ratio that
you have with your initial parameters, and also calculate the
cylinder shim thickness required to reduce the CR to the "desired"
number that you supplied initially.   Of course, this shim thickness
number will be negative if you ask for a higher compression ratio
than the initial one.

   If you would like a copy of the spread sheet,  I will be happy to
forward it to you.   It is extensively commented, so that you can see
how the calculations are done.  I note that either yourself or
whoever else put together your web site has considerable expertise;
the site is perhaps the best one that  I have ever seen.   I
therefore presume that the expertise exists on your end to
incorporate the spreadsheet as an interactive calculating routine on
your web page.   If you wish to invest the necessary time and effort
to do this, please feel free to do so.   I wouldn't have the
slightest idea of how to go about it, so I'm afraid that I can't do
that work for you, but you're welcome to it if you think that it
would be of any value.   In any event, please feel free to use the
spreadsheet in house.

					Regards,
                                                            Jim T.

P.S.   Please let me know about that price on a rebuilt distributor
for my '74 2.0 litre.

					Thanks,
