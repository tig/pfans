At the urging of a friend, I'm forwarding this to the list.  These are my
experiences with installing BMW 320i brakes and replacing the front
wheel bearings on my 914:

>OK- I've got the 320i brakes on my 'teen.  Was an interesting and
>educational afternoon.  Here's a (not so?) quick rundown on what happened:
>
>Got to Richard's house about 10:30.  Put the front of the car up on
>jackstands, pulled both front wheels (driver's side still stuck, took us
>about 15 min to work it off).  Bearing caps & bearings, no problem.
>Calipers & brake lines no problem (an air gun can be your friend ;-).
>
>Punched out old bearing races, installed new races, bearings, & seals, hit
>first snag- one of the inner bearings had been mis-boxed, so we had to put
>everything down & go exchange it.

>Greased up all the bearings & installed them- both wheels turn much
smoother
>& easier.  Outside the snag with the wrong bearing, probably took an hour
>for both sides.
>
>Calipers:  BMW calipers were perfect, and the difference in pad size was
>very obvious.  (I thought the BMW pads were small until I saw the 914 pads-
>must be I'm used to those big old American things... ;-)  Had to bend the
>rotor splash shields out of the way until we got them on, then bend shields
>back around caliper.  (Could have trimmed them, but this was quicker &
>easier- doesn't look bad.)  Brake line feed is actually closer than
>original- we managed to use the original tubing.  This would normally be a
>no-no, but it's pretty heavy steel tubing (I wouldn't risk it with aluminum
>or copper) and the re-bending was very minimal.  Time to install calipers:
>hour and a half.
>
>Bled brakes.  This is where the three stooges gene took over.  We spent
over
>45 minutes pumping the pedal & trying to get something to happen, checking
>master cylinder often.  It would leak down a little, we'd top it off to the
>very top of the filler neck.  After 45 minutes, we had nothing but sore
>legs.  I was futzing around with the m.c. cap, took the screen off the
>filler, and *what do you know*- the !#$#!! thing was bone dry instead of
>full- Doh!  Filled m.c., had brakes in 5 minutes.  The pedal is a little
>spongy- I probably need to bleed the rears now, but I was in a hurry by
that
>point & had to go.
>
>The jury's still out on how well it's going to work.  I'm going to try to
>get some seat time in the car this week & get those brake pads bedded in,
>maybe harangue someone into helping me bleed the rears & see if that helps.
>Right now, I think it's a dead swap, but should get better with a few miles
>on the new brakes.  Also, I've still got the stock 17mm m.c. on- won't be
>able to do anything about that for at least a month (my motorcycle's
getting
>jealous- need to spend some money on it now... ;-)
>
>One final thing:  I did note on removal that the stock calipers and pads
>were in *very* good shape- I don't think they had many miles on them.  When
>I bleed the rears, I'll see what's involved in that swap.


Comments:
1)  I had a friend who's a machinist machine the mounting bosses for me.
2)  As a general rule, I DO NOT recommend re-bending the brake lines.
It turns out mine were in pretty good shape, there wasn't much re-bending
to be done, and they held up.  Also, ALWAYS use a tubing bender!  it will
make your life much easier in the long run.  I had planned on using new
tubing that I had bought, but didn't need it.  Since my car lives indoors,
I'm
checking for leaking brake fluid every time I take it out for a while.

Things I learned:
* Plan these adventures to start on Saturday (or better yet, Friday night)
so you've got plenty of time to discover wrong parts & exchange them
before the parts stores close.  (I think it took us three hours to do the
actual work, but it took us six hours to do the job...)
* Get all the parts/supplies you think you might need ahead of time, and
see what else you can fix while you're there.  I have no idea if the front
wheel bearings on my car had ever been replaced before, and it wasn't
that expensive, so I just went ahead and did it- turns out that it was
needed.
* Don't throw away the old parts until you're sure you won't need them-
at one point I thought I was going to have to re-use one of the dust seals
when one of my new ones got destroyed (trying to get that wrong bearing
onto the spindle...),  but the parts place had one in stock- blind luck,
it's
normally a special order item for them...  The bearings were a standard
size- one of them was just mis-boxed.
* Don't panic.  I almost lost it when we couldn't get brake pressure,
sure that my m.c. had somehow self-destructed.  Turns out to have
been nothing more than a little bone-headedness.
