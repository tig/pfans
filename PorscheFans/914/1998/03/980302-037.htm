Hi Andy and Toby!

Both of you asked similar questions regarding the torque spec for the
oil pressure sending unit;  I reproduce Andy's below:

manual.

   I'm not sure what to tell you on this one... you see, my '74 is,
as far as I can tell,  1/8 inch NPT (National Pipe Thread).   This is
a tapered thread, and so a torque specification is not really
appropriate.   One just applies sealer to the threads, and tightens
it by feel until it seems "tight".   One needs a feel for plumbing
threads for this; I don't know quite how to describe it.   I would
say that 1 to 1-1/2 turns after it gets beyond finger tight would be
about right.   If it leaks, turn it another 1/4 turn or so.

   All of this is predicated on the idea that your sensor indeed has
a tapered pipe thread.   If it has a machine thread and a shoulder
with a washer, all bets are off.   My original sensor was a tapered
thread, however, and stood out from the engine case when "tight".   I
replaced it with a VDO sender which supports a gauge as well as an
idiot light, and the VDO official "adapter" flex line came with 9/16"
U.S. wrench flats (not 14mm ... there is a noticable difference) and
1/8" NPT threads where it goes into the engine case.   So I put it
together just like a plumber would, and it has worked fine ever
since.

  If you would like, I can send you my original write-up on the VDO
oil pressure gauge conversion, which amplifies a bit on the pipe
thread anomoly.  Please let me know.

   This probably confuses the issue, but it's the best that I can do.

					Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
