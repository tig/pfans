From what I remember from classes you are right.  From the Bob Hoover
sermons where he mentions painting the cylinders I think he is talking
about it as a tradeoff.  The idea is to paint them with a thin (emphasis on
thin) coat of flat black. This will affect the forced air convection
slightly but it is to prevent them from rusting which would eventually
reduce it even more than the paint would.

     Just got back from a week of illness so I only caught the end of
     a Cylinder Painting Rift.  Forgive me if this has already been
     discussed.
     Classically, radiantly cooling something has always been magnitudes
     less efficient in a gaseous environment (earth's atmosphere) than
     the heat one can take away from Forced Convection (air flowing over
     cooled subject).  While space craft use radiant cooling
     exclusively, they have no choice since there are no handy gases in
     space to carry away heat.  Painting the 914 (or 911/912 etc) engine
     a matte black would optimize it efficiency as a 'black body
     emitter' (maximum radiant cooling), but the layer of insulation
     from the paint would not insignificantly reduce the most important
     source of cooling, the forced convection of air over the engine.
     Now I've not done this experiment to prove this idea.  It is based
     on my Heat Transfer education (both theoretical and in practice)
     since I'm a Mechanical Engineer and design computer cooling and
     machine cooling systems.  I'd love to hear from anyone who has had
     success with reducing operating temps in aircooled motors, and can
     expose me as the armchair physicist I pretend to be!
