I think you'd be better off converting the '70 tail shifter to a side
shifter using the parts from the '73. You need at least the following from
the side shifter:

rear housing (with speedo drive)
shift rails 
side mounted selector

As far as I can tell, everything else is the same between the two
transmissions. You need to keep the intermediate plate that goes with the
ring and pinion, as well as the tunnel housing. You'll need a gasket kit, of
course.
