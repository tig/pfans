Removing a 914 Fuel Tank
Adventure for Dummies Like Me.
By Mike Cooley

* Use at your own risk.*

Go to your local hardware store and buy one of those cheapo but it works
manual pumps for siphoning water. Squeeze bulb kind. Paid $2.99 for the one
I bought.
Also buy a 5" length of 1/2" hose that will fit the pumps straight hard
plastic tube connection after the hard tube itself is pulled off.

You will need these tools for removing the tank:
A little patience, courage and humor,
hand pump above,
1/2" diameter hose above,
jack to raise the 914 
2 jackstands
Medium size flat bladed screwdriver,
17 mm socket,
13 mm open end wrench,
8mm socket,
A good drop light
Pair of safety goggles. Gas could get in your pretty eyes. It hurts!

These for painting the tank:
masking tape
a spray can of GOOD glossy black paint

These for cleaning the tank:
A local do it yourself car wash,
At least 9 quarters if doing this in the USA,

 
Remove the leads from your battery.
Again. Remove the leads from the battery. You don't want to burn yourself up!

Open your front lid and remove fuel cap from the tank.
Insert the 1/2" hose straight down into the fuel tank. Distance from top of
where you put fuel into the tank to the base of tank is 14 1/2". Keep the
hose straight as possible on those 14 1/2" to get all the fuel out.
Siphon fuel from tank with hand pump which you squeeze to siphon into a safe
to use container. It will have rust in the fuel so you will need to
transport to suitable disposable place. A gas station was my choice.

Jack up the 914 and install 2 jack stands for your safety.
Position drop light under front of 914 so you can reach it when under 914.
Now you will be under the front of the 914, just behind the passenger side
front wheel. There you will see 2 hex head bolts that retain the Rack and
Pinion cover.
 
Some of you won't have the rack and pinion cover so you won't need the 17mm
socket and 13 mm open end wrench.
   
Those that do have this cover, loosen the 2 bolts, but don't remove them
yet. Now feel and you will locate the 2 small bolts on the rear of the
cover. Remove them completely with the 13mm open end wrench. Hold one hand
under the cover to support it and finish removing the 2 larger bolts to keep
from dropping it.

Get the light and look up. there is a good size round hole. in it you will
see 2 hose. They are fuel supply and fuel return hose. Loosen the clamps by
unscrewing them with a medium size flat bladed screwdriver.

Careful now.  You do have the safety goggles on for there will be gas in the
hoses you are about to remove. Keep your head away as far as possible when
pulling hoses off.  The 2 hose will have to be pulled off of the right angle
fittings there on the bottom of the fuel tank and more than likely, you will
break the smaller hose when pulling. It is usually very rotted. Pull the
larger hose off 1st. Slid the clamp off and put in place where you won't
lose it. Do the smaller hose now. Told you it would tear and you need to
replace with new one since its probably hopelessly rotted anyhow. Catch fuel
in something other than your face. I used one of my wifes old sauce pans.
She won't miss it as she doesn't know how to make sauce. Do not REUSE for
cooking. Causes gas on the stomach. :-( 
You could also just use an old throwaway jar. Dispose of whatever you use in
the proper manner. NEVER KEEP the container with fuel in it.

Ok. Back on the top to the fuel tank.  Don't bump your bean on the lid.

There is a long bolt that holds a strap together right there in the very
center of the tank. Unscrew it with the flat bladed screwdriver you forgot
and left under the 914. Geez, I gotta tell you everything!!

Pick up that plastic part on top of the tank that strap was holding the
clamp on and put it where you can get it when reinstalling the tank. Don't
lose that long bolt either, as it is made of special exotic material that
only a magic genie can make if you lose it :-))).

Pull STRAIGHT UP on the fuel tank to remove. Don't cock it because it may
NOT come out if you do. BTDT.

With the tank out and laying on it side, look at the tank. Is it rusted bad?
No. then be extremely careful now as you don't want to break or bend either
of the right angle hose fitting by sitting tank on them.

There on the top side is the overflow (where you put the fuel in). It has 8
small hex head bolts. Use the 8mm socket and remove them. Pop lightly with
palm of your hand and the metal overflow will separate from the tank. Screw
the 8 hex heads with the lock washers back in to tank by hand to keep from
losing them.

Over a little piece you will see 5 more hex heads bolts holding something
inside your tank. It is the fuel meter. It will come straight up and out
after you remove those 5 hex head bolts and washers with the 8mm socket. You
will have to pry up lightly with a screwdriver, which you probably left in
the front trunk.
Screw all 5 hex head bolts with lockwashers back into the holes to keep from
losing them. Place the  Overflow and fuel meter in a safe place. You can not
buy them separately from a tank that I am aware of.

If you look down into the overflow hole on the tank, you are going to see rust.

Take the tank ONLY down to your local do it yourself car wash. Get a lot of
quarters from that good looking cashier and using the high pressure wand,
set on RINSE, feed it some quarters. Jet blast that sucker inside until you
run out of at least $2.25 worth of quarters. Drain as much as possible to
remove any water.

Now buy a gallon of fuel. No, it doesn't have to be 93 octane. You are going
to swish that gallon around and then you are going to dispose all the
washing out fuel into a proper place. Empty tank now. Careful you don't drop
the tank.

Take it back home and let it dry out good for at least 3 days before
following your steps backwards, including reinstalling the overflow part and
fuel metering cylinder, to replace the tank. 
Install a new piece of fuel line hose on the small line that you can see and
do very easily where it connects to the plastic tube before entering tunnel
before sitting tank back in. 

Good idea. Spray the tank with a good glossy black paint after using masking
tape on any surface that you want to keep from painting such as the cap, the
octane decal, etc. Definately worth the $5 or so you may spend.

Once all is back in place, put a gallon of fuel in tank. Check and remedy
any leaks before starting engine. Put battery leads back on and crank. Check
again for any leaks. See none. Good. Now drive down and fill it up and enjoy
the fact that you did this little repair yourself.

See, even dummies like Mike Cooley can do their own work if they just try.

Got a better way? Well, write your own and help others.
