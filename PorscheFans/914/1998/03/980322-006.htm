	I'm back, after a week off.  I wandered around New Orleans for
a while, and had a great time.  I spotted one 914 there--parked in the
driveway of a house near where I was staying.  A black car with a
chrome rear bumper--appeared to be a 70 or 71, but hard to tell from
that vantage.

	Jeff, in his search to keep his MPS properly hooked up, asked
about a tool for removing the pins from the electrical connector.  I
talked to the good folks over at Global Metrics, and bought a tool from
them.  It looks like a small piece of U-channel, with each end ground
down to a smaller tab.  The tab is about 3/8" long.  The two tabs are
of different widths, presumably for use on different-sized pins.
	By the way, you *can* flood a 914.  The wire to my thermo-time
switch broke, and grounded itself.  The car would not quite start when
warm.  Lots of fuel smell from the tailpipe, lots of cranking, but no
starting.  I pulled the FI Trigger wires, ran the car for 10-15 seconds
(I am not kidding!), let it die, then it would start fine after re-plug-
ging the trigger points back in.
	For "Kaminiki", check the article on the 914 fuel pump control
system on Tim's 914 Fan Page in the Tech Refs section.
<http://www.estinc.com/porsche>  It will tell you which electrical sig-
nals are used to keep the fuel pump running.  You may not need a new
relay board at all.
