I would think twice about running without head gaskets.  MSHP suggested the
same thing to me, and now I've got compression readings that vary from 115
psi to 140 psi, and oil leaking out between the heads and cylinders.  Looks
like I'm going to have to drop my engine again.  If you're willing to take
the chance, go for it.  If you don't want to worry about it again (well, at
least for the next 100,000 miles or so), then use em'.  My engine is
equipped with Euro pistons, two .010 base gaskets on each cylinder (you
definitely need at least two if you're running without a head gasket -
otherwise, the pistons will smack the valves), and my heads had been fly cut
by the PO.  After measuring the combustion chamber volume (58 ccs), that
results in a compression ratio of 8.3:1, which is just fine.  The only way
to tell what yours will be for sure is to measure the combustion chamber
volume, and then perform the calculations.  Let me know if you get to this
point... I think someone put together a spreadsheet that will do it for you
automatically.
