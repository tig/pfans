Hi folks:
Just returned from spring break with the 8 yr old. We dug for diamonds in
Mufressboro, AR, toured Hot Springs, etc. Had a great time. It was 72 on wed
and snowing this morning in Fayetteviille. I am not addicted but alice would
not let me take the notebook on the trip. I was in serious trouble until I
logged in last night. What a great week. Thanks to Mike and others on the fuel
tank removel and break bleed. I was about to take the tank out to work on the
blower motor and check around for the installation of a sway bar. (Everyone
says I should have one although I don't race the car. ). This kind of brings
up a point. After looking at the photos and downloading the Pelican Parts tech
article, I checked the fender wells and noted that since I have an A/c, the
receiver/dryer seems to be in the way of the mounts. Has anyone installed such
with the A/C?

As to the value of the list: Dave Darling was right on about my head temp
sensor!. My problem with the car just stopping (engine) and then running great
(and stopping) was attributed to the coil by Gordon Luy (great guy from
Winnipeg, Ontario who helped us get lost in the Branson ralley). He was right
although the coll was only 18 mths old. 
Thanks to everyone

D-Jet)
