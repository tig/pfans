Hey all,

	Just checking in to see if the list is still alive. I havn't seen any
914 posts recently.

	In case anyone is wondering what sick and twisted things I'm doing to
the FI of my 914, here's my plan so far:

-	Take a set of 44 IDF webers, strip out the jets and other "carb"
related harware, reducing it down to a body, a throttle plate, and
venturies (if needed). Plumb a "balance bar" between the two to
equilibrate the vacuum, and mount the D-jet related vacuum sensors on
said balance bar (tube connecting the two banks).
-	Figure out some way to incorporate TPS into the weber throttle
linkage.	
-	Balance idle settings with carb synchronizer.
-	Mount Secret(tm) O2 sensor in the Bursch collector and use to optimize
mixture settings.
-	Use venturi sizing to choke down the thottle bore as neccessary to
optimize power band for desired application.

	Future plans include a fully programble FI to replace the aging, but
still functional and reliable, D-Jet FI.

For those interested in obtaining an O2 sensor/gauge kit, let me know
(Hi Dave!). A friend of mine is developing his own, and in my opinion is
superior to the K&N and other LED bargraph gauges. This unit is a
-large- LCD digital display, so you know very accurately what the
mixture is. And in addition, the sensor is of the 3 wire variety, not
the 2 wire like many others. The 3 wire is faster and more accurate but
has less of an extreem range. And I figure if you're _that_ rich or
_that_ lean, there are going to be some other signs as well. Oh, and did
I mention that it's cheaper than the other aftermarket gizmos as well?
:)
