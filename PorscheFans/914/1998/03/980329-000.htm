Todd and the List,
I believe very strongly that the problem you are having with you fuel
injection eccentric hunting is the throttle shaft sticking in its boss. The
boss is where the shaft, which has the brass butterfly on it, rotates on
both sides of the throttle body. Mention of weather is the important clue to
your problem.

To verify it is sticking, squirt a good shot of WD40 into each side of the
boss. If this gives you more of a steady even idle, the sticking shaft is
the cause.
A quick fix for everyday driving is to remove the throttle body and clean it
with carburator cleaner, remove the throttle shaft from the throttle body
and polish it with a CLOTH buffing wheel until it shines like polished
chrome. If the shaft has excess wear you can see circular lines of wear on
the shaft itself. If this is the case, what is causing your uneven idle is
the brass butterfly sticking because the bosses are wallowed out of round.
Still polish the shaft and the brass butterfly for a more fluid response
when giving your toy the gas. 

Do not fool around with the black throttle switch. Under no circumstance
should you remove the black cover since it will likely break when
separating. Note the hash marks on the left side of the TB because you want
them to be the same place in relation to the center marker on the outer side
there where the slot head screw tightens down. I will supply you
instructions for setting the throttle switch if you have a problem. I
promise you it is not hard to learn fast.

I am Mike Cooley, formally The Southern Knight who did some repairs to some
of the list members throttle bodies. What I basically did was to install
oil-lite bronze bushing into each side to replace the worn bosses. I can
start doing this service again for $60 + $3 postage if I can get enough
people to warrant my buying some tools to do my setup again. My turnaround
is one day in my possession and time for mail both ways, usually 3 days each
direction by Priority Mail. This is the only way I will ship for $3.

Try what I suggest above and maybe you will get thru the summer months
happily. In the fall, if you like and are not using as a daily driver, send
to me, along with the $63 money order and I'll make your TB happy again. Ask
for references on the list. You will see that I do 1st class work from those
who had there done by The Southern Knight, fighting high cost of 914
repairs. I do this at hopefully break even cost since it is just a hobby for
me. My price is $20 higher than before, because that is about how much I
LOST on each I did before.

Best wishes and good luck.
