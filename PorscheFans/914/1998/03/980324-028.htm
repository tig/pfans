My gut feeling is that your engine is running too rich.  During startup,
then head temp sensor tells the computer to run a little richer than normal.
In addition, the cold start valve injects additional fuel into the intake.
Normally, the Aux. Air Valve opens to compensate for the additional fuel,
thus increasing the overall engine speed, but not changing the micture.  If
your Aux. Air valve was failing to open, then you would be left with a rich
condition.  If there was something wrong with your head temp sensor, then
this could also be the problem.  The reason that I think you're running too
rich is because the symptoms you describe sound almost identical to my
engine when it was running to rich.  It always stumbled, and "cut-out" on me
under throttle.  My best guess was that the additional fuel was fouling the
plugs, causing the engine to miss.  The other tell-tale sign is the
backfiring, which is almost always (in my experience) due to unburnt fuel
entering the exhaust.

I hope this helps,
