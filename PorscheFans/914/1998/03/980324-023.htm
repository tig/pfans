	That's not stock that I'm aware of.  I just picked the fan shroud
as a convenient ground that was pretty "distant" electrically from the
battery ground.
	Actually, come to think of it, it may not be all that distant.  I
did put a big ground wire from the alternator bracket (which attatches to
the fan shroud) to the chassis ground in the front-left of the engine
compartment.  That did seem to help my charging problems somewhat.
	Perhaps your previous car had a similar problem at one point.
