Has anyone actually ordered from them?  Their site and the info is great, I
do appreciate all the information.  As a result of looking at all the great
info I decided to do some work this weekend I've been putting off and would
order the parts from them.  They are very close to me in southern Calif and
I could get UPS delivered in one day.    But there doesn't seem to be
anyone there on the phones??

I tried several times and just got their answering machine.  After trying
during the day yesterday to reach someone I left a message last night with
my daytime phone number (as the message suggests).

No call today.  I tried calling during the morning again and same answering
machine.  As a result they lost the sale!

I called GPR who are also fairly close and answer the phone.  I've had
nothing but good dealings with them.  I called since there was still the
chance that if they ship today I will get the UPS shipment tomorrow for the
weekend work.

Again I appreciate the great info Pelican Parts is putting up but they need
to get their ordering part working.
