Yes. Just so happens that I did a valve adjustment on my 914 this afternoon. That's exactly how I did it. Used a .006 and
..007 for the intakes, and .008 and .009 for the exhausts. This is called a GO-NOGO procedure.

BTW, I was a bit surprised that all of mine were from .001 to .002 loose. This after about 7000 miles since the last
adjustment. I expected them to stay the same or get smaller/tighter. Any ideas as to why? (Maybe I just goofed up last
time :-))
