FWIW, I just finished installing my heating system again.  I couldn't get
several of the existing pipes to match up (I've got stainless steel heat
exchangers), so I fabricated my own.  I found this really cool galvanized
steel pipe that bends and extends like a flexi-straw.  It was $6 for 18
inches, with a 2 1/2 in. diameter.  These fit over the heat exchangers, and
extended right over the entry tube into the passenger compartment.  With a
couple of exhaust clamps I was able to cinch them down really tight.  It
means that I can't turn my heat completely off, but I can live with that for
now (plus, it only takes about 10 minutes to disconnect them for the
summer).  I also bought some new thermal hose for the blower motor.  Now, my
914 gets nice and toasty, and it doesn't even smell like exhaust!
