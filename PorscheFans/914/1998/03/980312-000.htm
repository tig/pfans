I also had problems with old original belts that wouldn't rewind. I was
able to pick up a complete set of 944 belts and anchors (with all bolts
and hardware) from a salvage yard. As I recall, the only changes were to
open up the holes in the firewall for the locating pins on the reels
(the 944 pins are larger). I used most of the 944 hardware and some
original - whatever seemed to fit best.They work great and look nice
too.
