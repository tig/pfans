Well, just made a few of phone calls and either the body shops don't even 
want to weld on a new nose to my 914 or they want over $2000 to do the job.

So.  Should I try to sell the car as-is or piecemeal?  Aside from sheet 
metal damage the front left rim is chipped (it's now worthless as a rim) 
and the right suspension assembly must be replaced.  The gas tank and 
surrounding components are fine (no gas leaks, either).  Even the spare 
tire is unscathed.

The car was my reliable daily driver but now...  See 
'http://www.geocities.com/MotorCity/8501/914stats.htm' for additional info, 
just remember that the front end is pretty mashed, primarily on the left 
side (should I put up current pictures?).

Honestly, I would rather sell her in one swoop and use the money on another 
second vehicle.  What do y'all recommend and how do I determine pricing?
