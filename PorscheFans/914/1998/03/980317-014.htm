Hi Ralph,

Thanks,  I'll try that to check the duration once I get it going again and
do a valve check.  I've got a dial gauge somewhere also so could try and
determine the lift.

I think the idle was ok when we finished.  It was getting late there but I
think I recall it being ok when you set it up with the vacuum gauge method.
Probably now a result of my bumping the dist and having to reset the timing
the basic way, the leaking hose that developed on the MPS, etc.  I'll see
once I get this one solved and things running again.

I though that high CO would be lean also when first though about it but
from reading manuals the high CO is a rich indication along with the high
HC.  There isn't enough oxygen to burn all the carbon so some exists as CO.
As it approches stoichiometric more is burned and converted to CO2 so that
level rises and the CO and HC levels drops.  Most cars recommend a small
percentage of CO which is just slightly on the rich side.

I'll test what I can and post results.  Hope to have a bit of time tomorrow
night to try a couple simple things, check the CO meter on my Tacoma, etc.

I also now have a 3 wire O2 sensor to go with the air-fuel gauge I got
awhile back.  Now with the welder I have I'm going to put a bung  in the
exhaust pipe this weekend also for another data point.  I like meters ;-)

Jeff:
Look in your Haynes - no not the ones you're wearing.  :)
Find the cam duration numbers.
Drop a valve cover and measure the duration of your intake and exhaust
valves.  It's probably much more than stock, but this will tell you for
sure.
Open the valve gaps until you get near stock duration.  In the case of
my '73 hiperf, it takes .030".
Re-assemble it and begin troubleshooting.  You will be able to make the
engine purr at idle, except for the clatter of valves.  Isn't high CO an
indication of too lean?  Not all the oxy is being consumed.
High HC is from too rich, as I understand it.
Once you have it set at stock, then you can re-adjust the valves for a
compromise of loud noise with good idle or quiet valves and maybe
2,000rpm idle.  I run mine at about .015".  I used to set it to .030"
just for the smog check, which it always passed - before SB 42.
Before any of you armchair authorities tell the world that .015 will
ruin the valve train and destroy the engine, this engine has been in a
daily driver for about 8 years now, and has accumulated maybe 100K
miles.  The rings are worn out, but the valve train isn't.
I didn't remember that we had a problem with idle, Jeff, but then I
probably don't remember a lot of things.  They say that memory is the
second thing to go.  Can't remember what's first.

More 914's right now than I care to admit.
