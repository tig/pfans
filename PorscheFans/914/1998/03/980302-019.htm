First - A big thank you to all that that have registered to the East
Coast Ramble on June 12, 13 &14..  Outstanding Response!!!  We think we
have begun to put together something that will become a "914 Ramble to
Remember".. Also, a huge thanks to the Shenandoah Region of PCA who is
now planning an event to coincide with ours - complementing our 914 turn
out with an expected 40 - 50 porsches of their own. Remember - we aren't
professionals at this stuff, so events/times might change.... So far,
some of the details are as follows:

Saturday  Morning - "Rally to Richmond!" - First Car off about 7:30 A.M.
The designated route is primarily off the interstate and leads through
some of Virginia's famous Peanut Farms and backroads...

Late Morning - Show and shine with the 914 group and the local PCA group
(No Q-Tips Allowed!) and People's Choice Awards for our 914 group. We
are also planning to have an area specifically for members of this 914
group. Note: We have reached an preliminary agreement with the President
of the Shenandoah Region - Weldon Scrogham - to bring along the Mark
Donahue 914-6 GT in appreciation of  the 914 owners who are coming in
for the "East Coast Ramble"...

Mid/Late-Afternoon - Tech Session with Picnic lunch.

Late Afternoon/ early Evening - Easy ramble back to Virginia Beach -

Sunday Morning - Attendees should be able to participate in either one
of two events: A formal Auto-X sponsored by the local PCA region (we are
working out details for location and registration requirements)... Or, A
"Gymkana" (What's that? We're not sure exactly - but Ed & I call it a
*fun* AutoX), Brunch

Again, as more info develops, we'll post it at
http://www.wgss.com/914/ramble.htm.
Thanks,
John & Ed
