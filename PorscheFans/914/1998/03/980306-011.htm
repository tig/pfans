Hey all,

On my 914 I have run both regular and synthetic oil before and after engi=
ne
rebuild. All I can say is my car leaks oil no matter what kind of oil is
ion there. The main difference is the synthetic will drip out when the ca=
r
is parked & cold. We are talking five drips after a week of no driving.
regular oil did not leak when cold. But here is the thing the synthetic o=
il
had lowered my engine temps to a point that I am comfortable with. I was
thinking about an oil cooler but now I think I'll be fine. I don't have a=

temp guage with numbers but engine temps went from the needle being in th=
e
P on the temp guage and real close to the red on the hiway to being down
near the E. Also afer long hiway drives at those temps the oil light woul=
d
come on at idle. That with a hi volume oil pump and 165 PSI on all piston=
s.
So I put up with the leaks for the cooler running. =



Nick
