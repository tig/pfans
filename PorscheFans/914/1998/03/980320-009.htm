I am finishing a CAD drawing of the floor pan patch that is under the driver
side feet area that I patched my 914 with. It is reasonably accurate but
definately not concourse. It does look authentic with the depth of the
recesses included.

The width covers the area from the bottom side of the side support member
(longitutional) across to the center tunnel seam. The length is from the
seam on the support cross bar under the seat for a distance of 21 1/4"
toward the front. 

I have to watch my money very close since I am retired is the reason for
making my own patch rather than buying from a vendor.
 
If there are any of you wanting a copy of my drawing, send a stamped self
addressed envelope and I will send you a free copy. I can send as an e-mail
attachment if you have Autocad, Autocad Lite for Windows 95 or are capable
of reading .dwg file with your graphic program. Private mail only and head
the subject as mikefb20.dwg if you want it attached.

You will need a piece 24" X 24" 22 gauge sheet metal to do the patch. I can
make a mirror imagine for the passenger side if you need it. Dimension are
identical.

Other areas will be drawn as I get around to it.
