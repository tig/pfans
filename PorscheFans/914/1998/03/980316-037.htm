Jeff, go by a local paint store and buy an empty gallon can with the lid. I
paid a dollar for mine. Use of the lid is ideal since you can put fuel in
easily and snap the lid back down tight.
 
Mate the petcock with right nipple at the hardware store. Buy a piece of
elastic about 2 feet long or use the elastic from a pair of old jockey
shorts you don't wear.
 
Drill 2 holes in lid and solder a small pipe fitting nipple in the 2
locations for your petcocks. Once soldered, screw the petcocks on, using
Dirks favorite, teflon tape, to keep from leaking at petcock. Cut a V in a
couple of short 2X4s and use these to keep it from rolling about on your
test table. Tack the elastic across each V to hold the paint can in a laid
down position. Use carpet tacks with the elastic stretched across the can.
Easy to remove can to fill. You might even want to glue the 2X4s in place on
your work table.

Mike Nugent's idea below is great. I will have to do that to mine ASAP. My
914 is thankful for what I get from this list.
