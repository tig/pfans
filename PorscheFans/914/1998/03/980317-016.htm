I had my relay board fail on 2/13/98, and the failure caused the fuel
pump not to energize and therefore the car not start. To get the car
started, I bypassed the harness wire on the front end of the board that
supplies power to the fuel pump and wired it into the red fuse mount on
the relay board.  I replaced the board with a used unit and today,
3/17/98, it failed the same exact way.  All of my round black  relays
are ok and no other problems manifested themselves. My question is this;
could there be another area I should be looking at for power failure to
the fuel pump, or would cause the board to fail?  I will be purchasing a
new or rebuilt relay board soon and would like to know if anyone else
has had this problem and what you did to rectify it. Please respond to
the list or my e-mail: kaminiki@ix.netcom.com Thanks.
