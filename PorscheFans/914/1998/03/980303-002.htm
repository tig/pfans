Just wanted to give some feed back to the group on my question of what to 
paint the engine sheet metal. Thanks to all of you that responded!
As with most of our endeavors there are as many solutions as there are 
people. The range was from powder coating to just wire brush and spray with 
anything left over from the last paint job like the deck chairs,etc.
The one thing that did stand out though, that I think is important is that 
the sheet metal does not get that hot. And regular old Rustoleum, Krylon, 
etc. will work and as proven by your responses. Many of you have had 
regular paint on for many miles and no real paint related problems. As
 914 Lite Mike said to me, "If you burn off regular paint on the sheet 
metal you really have a bigger problem than just burnt peeling paint!!!"

Regards

John
