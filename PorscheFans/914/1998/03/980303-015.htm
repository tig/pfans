That would be stylin', though I'm not that into chrome :-)

Would definitely brighten up the engine compartment,  going to have to
repaint the tins when I do the engine pull.

The heat transfer of the sheet metal isn't really an issue.  This has come
up a lot on the VW lists.  Bob Hoover ( see the Type 2 Sermons site) went
over this.  He is real adamant about the heat transfer on anything in
contact with the oil or oil mist and heat, like the valve covers, pushrod
tubes, cylinders.  Recommends a thin coat of flat black paint as the best
compromise for heat transfer and rust protection.

The sheet metal is for containing and directing the cooling air so heat
transfer with it isn't a big issue, paint or chrome doesn't really affect
things much with the 'sheet metal shrouds'.

The Corvair Turbo Corsas had CHROME sheet metal. Now, that's what I call
style! Heat transfer be damned!
