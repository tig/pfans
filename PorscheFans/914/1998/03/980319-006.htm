My questions come from a strong belief in reading and following the rules
of your competition of choice but at the same time pushing them for all
that is allowed. I also wonder if the governing bodies who classify cars
and write the rules have ever used empirical testing to justify their
dictates of if it is usually someone getting on the rules committee and
then doing all he can to outlaw the guy who has been beating him like a
drum. So, if anyone can help with my decision, I'd appreciate it.

I am looking at PCA Competition rules since I run in autocrosses and time
trials here in South Texas (this means a year round schedule). I like the
competition in stock classes since we have a lot of people running but I
would not mind running improved if my car would feel better as my daily
driver. I would like to know about the resulting power changes from
displacement changes as they apply to a fuel injected 2.0. For the sake of
this exercise assume that a motor will be rebuilt in any case. Facts that I
am looking at are:

1. A 2.0 displaces 1971cc.

2. I can remain in stock and increase the bore by 1.2mm and bring the
displacement up to 2022cc's.

3. A 96 mm big bore kit would place me in Improved 1 class and would have a
displacement of 2056cc's.

4. Displacement increase over 120cc (2091) puts you in Modified
(undesirable) So I am interested only in 1, 2, or 3.

5. Any other engine modifications (bigger valves, different cams, etc.),
other than balancing, put you in modified.

Are pistons available 1.2mm oversize or would I have to have them made? If
I do, how much would they cost? Who is a good source for a 96mm kit? 

In any case, there are penalties for increasing the bore to 96mm, changing
the fuel system to carbs, and increasing the compression ratio. Any one of
these changes moves you to Improved from Stock, and you can only do one of
these three options and remain in Improved. Does anyone have any idea what
kind of shims or machining would be necessary to bring the C/R back to
stock with either option 2 or 3? Can the Djet be adjusted enough to run
with the slight increase in displacement? And I guess most important,
option 2's displacement is 102.6% of stock and option 3's is 104.3% of
stock so can anyone give me some idea of horsepower increase and do you
think it would be noticeable.
