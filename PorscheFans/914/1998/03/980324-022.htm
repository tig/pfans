strap, whole deal to firewall, battery post to engine fan shroud.

That reminded me.  My original parts car had a ground strap from neg bat
post to the fan shroud.  Current car didn't.  I've been assuming that the
other car had it due to some ground problems?  Is this actually a stock
item?  My car seems to run without it (now that I've fixed other problems).
Have a good ground strap at tranny end.  Do I need this?  Seems like it
couldn't hurt and gaurantees good grounds at the engine but one more thing
in the way in the engine compartment.
