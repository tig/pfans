Boy, I'm really enjoying the info flying around this topic. FI tweaking
is sure fun. 

Josh said somewhere that he wanted a temporaty fix until he builds the
ultimate system. Here's what worked for me.

An L-Jet rising-rate fuel-pressure regulator increased fuel flow at open
throttle settings to give a slightly richening mixture at high-rpm (as
measured on my A/F meter). It worked amazingly well without overly
richening the idle and low-speed A/F ratio as other fixes do.

After my heads were flowed and the compression raised slightly over the
Euro-piston spec, I got the same leaning-out readings on my A/F meter.
My mechanic suggested a rising-rate fuel pressure regulator, similar to
the one on the L-jets. It Tees into the vacuum line (be sure to use the
vacuum port BELOW the throttle plate) and varies the pressure from 28-36
psi (L-jet unit may vary slightly). 

With the unit, the pressure increased quickly with open throttle,
reaching full pressure by about 2,500rpm or so. On the meter I
repeatedly saw rich mixtures in the 11-12:1 range at extended highway
and track driving, but idle in the 15:1 range(where I set it).
I finally sprang for the cool ex-Masarati bi-turbo adjustable unit from
CB Performance because the idle pressure was adjustable and the rate of
rise/change in manifold pressure was 1.5:1 (L-jet and 944 turbo units
are 1:1). My mechanic also supplied me with what looked like a modified
bosch unit that had a brass adjusting screw added to adjust the idle
pressure (anybody know who stocks these?)

Josh, as an experiment, try hooking up an L-jet fuel pressure regulator
(I think they are all about the same, but 944 turbo and 1.7 for sure).
See if that offsets the leaning tendency for you. If it does, you can
look for one with adjustable idle pressure if you need that).

In an analog world, analog measures are called for.
