Ed,
While I have no personal experience, I do know that someone bought a 914
from me (Barry Buckingham, Humboldt, Tn.) and installed a 350 engine from a
Vette into it. He came by and gave me a driver seat position. I will tell
you that it went as fast as I ever would like to ride on a public highway.
The curves and twists in the back roads were managed easily since it was a
914 except for the engine. The momentum of thrust was much like a Pantera
when accelerating. He said eventually he might try and find a Dino engine
for his other 914 if he could pick one up at a bargain price. 
This has been 4 years back so I never know if he did the Dino thing but the
350 was still an awesome ride I will NEVER forget.
Also consider the Corvair Corsa Turbo engine. Power there is 911 quality if
set up right without all the cost. 
Save your 914 engine or just donate it to me. :-))))
I am a purist about MY 914, but what make you tick should always be your
choice and no one else should interfer with your own decision.
Good luck.

Mike
