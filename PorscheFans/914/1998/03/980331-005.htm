Dave,    You know, I bet that back in the late sixties, there was a
worthy German engineer who was assigned the desiogn of the relay board,
or at least the portion of it that held the voltage regulator. He spent
5, maybe 10 minutes, deciding that that little sheet metal screw on the
skirt of the regulator was the appropriate method for retaining the
device. Here you go, 30 years later, without the screw, so that guy's
time was just wasted. I hope you feel bad about that. Maybe Karma
droppped the hail on your haid.
