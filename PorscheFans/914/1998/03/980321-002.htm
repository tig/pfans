Please note that the SCCA Solo Events Board (SEB) sent my proposal to the
Street Prepared Advisory Committee (SPAC) to consolidate all the 914 4
cylinder cars onto one line in the C- Street Prepared classification or
move the 1.7 & 1.8 liter cars to DSP.

Now, the 1.7 and 1.8 liter cars are on a separate line from the 2.0 liter
cars. This distinction makes it much more expensive to autocross a 914
because the update-backdate rules limit parts to cars on the same line in
the rulebook. Realistically, most parts are interchangeable between all
the 4 cylinder 914s. The bodies and most of the drivetrain, suspension
and transmissions are the same in all cars.

914 owners are not allowed near as many modifications as other cars
because the heating system is part of the engine cooling system and the
exhaust system. So, no headers, no cooling tin mods, no electric fans are
allowed in a 914 Street Prepared car. Link that with the limit of
separating the 1.7 & 1.8 cars onto a different line effectively makes the
914 uncompetitive in SCCA Solo II competition in CSP.

I think the best thing to do would be to put the 1.7 & 1.8 cars into DSP.
But your input is needed by the SPAC to help them along whatever path you
would like to see followed.
