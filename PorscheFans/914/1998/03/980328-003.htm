got y'er piston pics..

first reaction is that much of these specs are "textbook", 1'll take
some  measurements, but my recollection is that the only important specs
are at D,( approx....) text says that "head" above D is smaller cuz it
is expected to expand under heat.. therefore meas of head *(ring areas)
is only relative to expansion characteristics which we cannot even guess
at ... text also says that the primary meas is 90 degrees to pin (D) &
pin side is smaller since the pressure & thrust is 90 degrees to the
pin... meas E, skirt is mostly irrelevant... you can cut & trim the
skirt as needed to clear the crankcase webs......... (i've done it... &
all racers do it..).  in the old days( i/m an old one) we knurled the
skirt (90 degrees to D) as a regular reconditioning step//... knurling
added oil holding  benefits as well as expanding the skirt to "fit"
closer to the cyl wall & prevent {rock" or "piston slap") .. this may be
a primary reason that the common VW advice is to junk the pc's & buy new
ones!!.. I tried to kill (by revving to max) a few old motors that had
"slap" & can tell you that the valves will float before the engine  will
destruct on account of slap... the noise may have  bothered you in a 53
plymouth, but you'll never hear it in a type 4 VW..

oh,yeah... i'm an ASE Certified Master Tech ....if it counts for
anything...
