	There's also a third one below the two black ones
that has a red knob.

	The top knob controls how much fresh air is coming
in.  It goes from off (left) to full flow (middle) and then
turns the cool air fan (up front, behind the gas tanks) on
low (I), med (II), or high (III) speed.
	The second knob controls where the cool air goes.
Left is down, to your feet, middle is the dash-side vents,
and right is up, to the defogger vents.  There is probably
some overlap between two or all three of these settings.
	The third (red) knob controls where the warm air
goes.  Selections are identical to the middle knob.
	The red lever to the rear of the shift knob controls
how much hot air comes into the cabin.  Down/forward is off,
gradually increasing as the knob is pulled up/back, to a
certain point which turns on the blower fan, located in the
engine compartment.  Without that fan, warm air is only
moved by the engine cooling fan.

	You say you have a defroster switch on the dash;
that is probably for the rear window defroster, lucky you!
If nobody's messed up the wiring, and the relay works, and
you have the rear window with the wires in it, you should be
able to heat your rear window!  Nifty stuff!
