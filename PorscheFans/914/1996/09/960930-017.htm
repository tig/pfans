Is your car an early 914 with the fuel pump in the original location? If so, 
I would suspect a mild case of vapour-lock.
My '70 914/4 will do the same thing after going through the drive-through. 
When I sit there idling (and thinking "Gee, it would have been faster to go 
in...") for five minutes or so, the first time I step on the accelerator it 
dies (usually just as I pull into the path of an Explorer), unless I'm very 
gentle with it. Once it's been revved it's fine.
