Imagine your cover extending 3 inches below the bottom of the case...
that's what mine is like.  It's got a similar bolt to the one used on
the original cover, but it's longer, of course.  The seal between the
cover/cylinder/deep sump thing and the case is fine... it's just this
pipe that sticks out of it that was welded shut, but not very well.
That's what leaks.  Rather than try to weld it, I think I'd rather just
switch back to the original strainer/cover.

Did that help?

I'll have to give Automotion a call... unless I can get a used one for
less!
