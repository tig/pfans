	I can't speak to the other cables (speedo cable looks kinda
tough, tho!) but the throttle cable is easy.  Took me about an hour,
figuring it out as I went along.  Mine had broken at the throttle
body end--the threaded part had broken off the tube.
	A prudent person might tie a string to the old cable before
they pull it out.  An idiot like me would just pull the old one out
and trust that he could thread the new one in correctly.
	You'll have to pull out some of your carpet for this.  I don't
think center console removal was necessary.
	The only difficult parts when I did it were getting the cable
adjusted right at the front end (it screws into a balljoint thing),
and pulling the pedal's lever back so I could get access to that ball-
joint.  Not very tough at all.
