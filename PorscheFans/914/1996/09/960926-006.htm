	Bing!  Okay, got it.  What you're talking about is an oil trap,
not the stock parts.  I've tried two of these so far, and neither one
lets you keep the screen.  The oil pickup tube extension is too fat for
the opening in the screen, and there is nowhere for the flange on the
screen to go.  The flange is what goes between the cover and the case,
BTW.

	If you're looking for cheap, it's probably cheaper to weld up
the old one.  Or, I have a used AutoMashin' unit that is slightly
damaged.  The pickup tube is crushed at the top (I guess I over-torqued
the retaining nut?) and the o-ring has squeezed out on one side.  The
bottom of the cylindrical trap is bowed up slightly in the middle.  I
think that was the only damage.  I was not really impressed with the
quality, but it kept the engine from starving in the corners...
	BTW, the one I'm using is an old (NOS?) Garretson piece, that
uses a stock cover plate as the bottom.  Welded to a cylinder to make
the trap.  The rest of it is identical; I think that Jerry Woods designed
the Garretson one, and AutoMashin' bought the rights to it.  If "bought"
is the right word; I heard a rumor that there was some sort of disagree-
ment on exactly what should be paid when...
