	First autoX since Baby's latest repair.  Yeah!
	Got up way too early on Sat; same time as on weekdays (ugh--6:30!).
Got everything ready, drove to Dublin.  The autoX was at the Santa Rita
Prison--most people who've seen me drive say I belong there anyway.  (OK,
it's really at the Alameda County Sherriff's Driver Training Facility.
Right next to the prison.)  Got there, astounded quite a number of people
who didn't think the car would *ever* run again, un packed the car, got on
grid for tech, and then started my course-walk.
	Yeeeech!  We must've been short on cones.  Gates, gates, gates!
Just like slalom skiing, you have to go between the cones that mark the
gates.  The problem is figuring out *which* cones out of that "sea of cones"
are the next gate!  I knew I was going to have problems with this one.
About 1/3 of the course was very strongly linked--to set up correctly for
the one straight section, you had to modify your entrance for that, which
meant you had to modify the turn before it, which meant you had to modify
the turn before that, which...  Goodness!  Actually, like so many courses
that look awful when you walk them, this one was a whole lot of fun to
drive.
	My group worked first.  My group was the "early four-banger"
group; all the air-cooled fours (VW motors like mine, VW-derived motors
like the 356's) and the 924 (Audi motor).  Maybe ours was the NARP group?
No, no, best to leave that one alone.  Running first was the "all street
911" group.  With 30+ years of 911 production, guess what the biggest
group was?  And it looked like by a factor of about three.  It took hours
and hours and hours to get them all through three runs.  It seemed like I
spent forever standing there with that green flag or the chekered flag in
my hand.  Yes, I was the flagman.  There were good moments, though.  My
friend Tish came by start/finish on her last run of the day--evidently a
good one.  I saw (from the top down) helmet, glasses, nose, and TEETH.
Great big smile; she finally beat her boyfriend Al.  Another person badly
blew the gates before start/finish, and knew it.  She came through with a
sheepish grin and kinda shrugged at me.  I couldn't help but laugh.
	Sure enough, just about everyone had problems with those gates.
I think there were only about three cars out of fifty or so that never
 missed one.
	I was not immune, either.  My very first practice lap, I got
distracted by thinking about what gear I should be in that I missed the
offset gate at the end of the straight.  Oops.  (But thank god for rev-
limiters!  VroooOOOOO-PA-PA-PA-PA-PA!!)
	Happily, that was my last off-course excursion, and because it
 was on a practice lap, it didn't count!
	From listening to the times of other cars, I figured I could be
happy with a 32.  First run was a 34, so I still had room for improvement.
The car was not real happy when I got it into third gear; I think the
mixture was off.  It was also skating  around a lot, the surface seemed
pretty slippery.  The fact that one car had put some oil down on the
course didn't help matters at all.  Not much oil, mind you, but it
doesn't take a lot!  (No puddles, more of a smoke-screen while he was
driving...)
	I tried to figure out where I was losing time, and how I could
get it back.  Tighter apexes, slowing down a little more for some of the
turns, etc.  Got back out there and pulled a 33 and change, just under a
1 second improvement.  Not bad, but I had been hoping for more.  The car
was definitely surging in third gear, and while pulling in the uphill
section.  Not much, but noticeable.  It was also pushing a fair amount.
I think that was mostly because of the way I was driving, but I decided
to see if I could do something about it mechanically.  So I bled about
two PSI out of the rears so they would  stick a little less.  Cold pres-
sures had been right around 40, warm pressures were about 42.  Remember,
these were *steet* tires, not tires with stiff sidewalls.  I also had to
remember to open up the wheel while I accelerated.
	My third and final run came up pretty quickly.  I didn't manage
to remember to open the wheel when I got on the gas, but I think the
tire pressure change helped me.  I was still *way* off my apexes in
several spots, and had a really crummy  line in the tight switch-back
before the straight.  There was at least another half-second out there
for me, but not today.  My time was a 32.4, which put me right around
where I was used to being in relation to the other drivers.  Baby was
*definitely* unhappy about the third gear section of the straight, and
the small up-hill bit on the way out.  If I could've gotten that sorted
out, I might have been able to  take another half-second off.  Well,
 maybe.
	This was only a half-day event, so my day was over by 12:30.  I
went to lunch with Soren and Lois, and when I stopped back at the event
(at about 2:00) it was already over.  The people running the second half
of the day had gotten *four* runs each, and were already done.  Damn,
maybe I'll sign up in the super-zoomy class next year!  There aren't
very may of them, so they seem to get a lot of runs....  (<Home Simpson
voice> More seat time!  Mmmmmmm.... </Home Simpson Voice>)

	Anyway, the surging got worse on the way home.  I decided I was
running rich, so I dinked  with the fuel pressure a couple of times.  I
also decided my new fuel pressure gauge wasn't very accurate.  Sunday, I
 put the old gauge back on, and re-adjusted the pressure.  It had been a
*little* high, but not much.  Hmmm...  And I still have that surging
problem.  Maybe an exhaust leak?  Well, I
guess that means it's time to call the pros.  I just got done with way
too many hours of messing with the car, and I'm not too deeply in debt
any more.  I think I can afford it.
	Which reminds me, I've got a phone call to make.  Later!
