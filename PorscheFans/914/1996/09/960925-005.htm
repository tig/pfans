When I purchased my car, it had the stock heat exchangers and a Monza
exhaust.  Two sets of headers and a Bursch were throw in for good
measure.  After the rebuild, I decided to go with the headers/Bursch.
One set of the headers is bent up at the end, and the other set is
straight.  I discovered that I had to use the straight ones with the
Bursch in order to get it to fit under the car.  Last weekend, I picked
up a new set of heat exchangers (it's starting to get cold out here),
and noticed that while they do have the dual-pipe trapezoid
configuration of the Bursch, they're bent up.  After a closer look at
the headers on the car now (the straight ones), it looks like the
straight ones were once bent like all the rest, but were bent straight
for the Bursch.  I'd like to bend the new heat exchangers straight so
they'll work with the Bursch as well.  I talked to some guys at Midas,
and they said they not only couldn't do it, they couldn't think of one
place that could.  The bend in the pipe doesn't happen until after the
heat exchanger part ends, so the thin sheet metal wouldn't have to be
bent.  I know this is probably a little confusing, but for those of you
who've managed to follow me this far...

Is it possible to bend these at all?

Is it something that I might be able to do myself (with a torch, vice,
and a big hammer)?

Do all of the heat exchangers/headers bend up at the end, or were some
made straight to begin with?

Thanks!
