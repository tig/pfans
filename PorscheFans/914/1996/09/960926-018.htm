Daves description is excellant to only real problem is that you need to be
driving the engine turning 4,000 +++ for all this to work well in rainy
weather. My soloution is to carry a couple of towels behind the seat. Run
with the fresh air blower on high to defrost.

The system in the 914 really is not adequate. for the my carrera it works
just fine.
