People drive 914's top-off for all sorts of reasons.  Thor must have 
bought his so he can stargaze - on his way to work at the observatory.  
:)

Where do you work/live, Thor?  I want to avoid that route.  
Suggestion to you:  Get a '75-76 with shock absorbing front bumper.

NUSUB:
The 914 is unusual, even here in SoCalif.  Two weeks ago I caught up 
with a guy in a 1.8 '74 on the 405 in Irvine.  Together we then 
overtook a Nordic female (I didn't say blonde) in a third 914.  
She didn't even blink at seeing us.

That one was heavily modified with a body the the likes of which I have 
never seen (the car, that is.)  The rear fenders came up to a peak, and 
the front was heavily modified too, save for the hood and maybe 
headlights.
