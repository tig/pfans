  I would appreciate some input...  I picked up some hose today from 
Lindy's auto parts which they claim is european style FI hose (high 
pressure) and charged me accordingly ($1.44/ft).  
  The problem is, this stuff is indistinguishable (apart from it's smaller 
diameter) from the black woven-fabric covered smog hose that I 
bought from G.P.R. to re-do the PCV and other vacuum stuff on the 
car ('74 914 2.0 litre).  The hose has no strength re-inforcement at all, 
except for the fabric outside cover, and the rubber is fairly thin.
  It is my opinion that the store people do not have this hose's use 
correctly typed, and that it should not be used for FI purposes.  
However, before I try to take it back, I need corroboration.  Does 
anyone know what the original hose fitted to the car looked like?  Was 
it the fabric-covered stuff?  Or was it heavier-duty high-pressure hose?
  Any input would be appreciated.  The last thing I need is an engine 
fire.
				Thanks,
				Jim T.
