OK, here's two:

1. On the way back from a SCSC(So Cal Sports Car Club) autocross at Cal Poly
Pomona (about 1979), the fuel pump died on my 1974 Fiat (Fix It Again,
Tony!) 128SP. As I also fly R/C airplanes, I happened to have a 1 gallon
fuel can and about 3' of small diameter fuel line in the trunk. After
filling the can with gas (from crawling under the car and undoing the main
fuel line), I strapped the can on top of the cowl/windshield base with
rubber bands and was able to shove the much smaller (say, 3/16" diameter!)
model fuel line into the carb feed fuel line. As they say, gravity did the
rest (although at a max of 20-25 MPH; the ID of the model fuel line was
about 3/32"!). Took me about 20 miles home, including slowly up a (very)
steep hill.

An interesting postscript: As it turns out, silicone model fuel line is not
compatible with gasoline, and the fuel line finally died (dissolved) in my
driveway....

2. I broke the throttle cable (at the pedal end, the crimp failed) on my '73
914 2.0 on a date one night (about 1980 or so, can you say "starving college
student"?).  By pulling the cable out of the sheath and routing it around a
large screwdriver stuck into the engine cover latch, I was able to (kind of)
set up a hand-operated throttle control by pulling on the cable with my arm
hanging out the window. It was enough to allow us to drive home (to get the
Fiat, go figure!), and was actually kind of fun, as my date had to shift the
trans (I was way too busy and not very coordinated to begin with!).

Let us know when you have the list compiled! should be fun to read...
