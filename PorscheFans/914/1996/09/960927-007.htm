Well, our land-lord has hiked our rent 50%, so I'm looking
for a good home for my rebuild project:  

	'73 914 2.0 Motor, with air-conditioning.  It has the AC
compressor, and AC sheet-metal.  I'd like $750 for it.  

	I also have a set of aluminum wheels (4-bolt 15 x 5 1/2 with
cheapo tires) that I used to have on my car.  These are NOT Fuch's;
they look pretty generic to me.  I bought them with the intent of
using them for snow-trips to the hills, but have only put them on
my car once (actually, to see if they fit).  The tires are close in
the quarter panels (rear) on my (stock) 914.  I'd suggest using them
with skinny tires.  How about $100 for the set, with tires.  

	I have lovingly disassembled it to the bare case.  I
had planned on doing a full rebuild of it, so the small parts (screws,
nuts and bolts) are organized into a mega-drawer organizer, and the
larger ones are in baggies.  The still larger ones (sheet metal, air
cleaner, etc.) are in large bins.  

	The heads have been cleaned and inspected by the Ellsworths
(shop in Mtn. View).  They have a some cracks, but the shop say's they
can be repaired.  The valves are pretty carbon-caked, and should be
replaced.  

	I haven't split the case, and hence don't know what condition the 
bottom end is like.  We can peer into it together, though (:-).  

	I've brushed the fan-housing to a shine, and put a clear-coat
on it (looks nice...).  I've also primered, and painted and clear-coated
the intake tubes a nice shade of blue (:-).  I was going to do the
sheet-
metal next.  It's rusty, but otherwise in ok shape (better shape than
the
sheet metal in my car!).  

	Sigh.  Anyway, I have about $750 into it (not counting labor), and
would like to get that (but would be happy for more :-) for it.  

	The motor and myself are located in Palo Alto, CA, which is about an
hour south of San Francisco.  Sounds silly, but I'd like it to go to a
good home;  someone who's gonna finish it, and run it, rather than part
it out.  Thought I'd
put it up here before the Merc (newspaper).  

	My number is 415-846-5085 at work and 415-855-9142 at home.  Call or
e-mail.  Thanks!  

						Anand.  
P.S.	Alternatively, anyone looking for a house-mate who's into 914's
:-)?
