Hi,

My clutch job is frozen with no progress due to a pilot bearing
that is refusing to be budge from its mating of 14 or so years.

This is a '82 924, it has the 15mm (or so) pilot bearing that is
set into the shaft (not into the flywheel). Ralph suggested
(thanks much!) I remove the flywheel which might give it some
room to play. But it is still stuck, frozen in there!  :-(

If it matters, the pilot bearing is a version II bearing, with
the shaft seal in the front (which was found to be all chewed
up, and I have cleaned the pieces out).

I believe that the 914, due to its similar VoPo genes, has a
similar pilot bearing set up, so I am copying to the 914 list as
well. Hope I dont have to apply a blind hack-saw to the old
bearing?

Anyone has any tips on how I can free up the frozen pilot
bearing ?? Damn my hand hurts tightening the puller, damn my
heart aches that the summer is all gone!

Thanks in advance,
