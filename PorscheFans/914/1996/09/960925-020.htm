To Todd et. al.

	Let's not malign other cars on hersay please. There are lots of other
great cars out there that have potential regardless of their pedigree.
Hey, even the LeCar bred the R5 turbo. As for VWs, I used to own and
autox an 8V GTI, and let me tell you, it made power aplenty all the way
up to the rev limiter. Unlike the poor 914 which starts running out of
breath long before the rev limiter kicks in. 

	Even the much ridiculed (and deservedly so) Yugo, has had an
entertaining racing history. Not very succesfull though...

The opinions here are those of the idiot that wrote it. Namely ME, so
don't go suing the DOE, they don't care...
