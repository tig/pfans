	A few thoughts, at random, in the order they occurred to me:

Umm, *what* o2 sensor?  What have you disconnected that helped?  Where was it?
I am not aware of any stock 914's that came with O2 sensors.

The throttle switch does two things:  1) tells the ECU ("brain") that the
throttle is at idle; 2) puts out 10 "pulses" when the throttle is opening that
tell the ECU to squirt extra fuel on acceleration (like a carbed car's accel-
erator pump).

An idle that goes up and down (like 1000 RPM-600 RPM-1000-600) is called
"hunting", and is frequently caused by a lean fuel/air mixture.  There are lots
of possible causes for that.

	First step in all FI troubleshooting guides is:  Check your ignition
system.  Are you getting good spark, at the right time?  This probably isn't
your problem, but this is a very very important first step.

	That is not a mixture screw.  That is the idle screw.  Turn it in to
decrease your idle speed, out to increase it.  It simply controls how much air
gets past the closed throttle.  Which doesn't effect the mixture.

>sealing...

	D-jets aren't as sensitive as the L-jet cars, or the CIS cars, or the
Motronic cars.  However, it's a very very good idea to make sure you don't have
any leaks, because some places that can leak *do* affect the mixture.
	One thing Thom's forgotten about in terms of vacc leak sealing is the
injector O-rings.  There are two per injector, one big outer one to hold the
injector onto the intake runner, and a small inner one that does the sealing.
They're cheap and pretty easy (just like me!  ;)  so if you're leak-eliminating
this is a good thing to add.

>- TEMP SENSOR

	There are two temp sensors.  One is in the intake air distributor, and
doesn't have much effect on the mixture.  You can check the resistance across
it hot and cold.  I forget the values, but there should be a change.
	Check the head temp sensor (the one Thom describes) before you remove
it.  Trust me, you *don't* want to strip this thing, so check it before you
pull it.  Cold-cold (after sitting overnight, f'rinstance) it should ohm out
at about 2.5 KOhms.  When warm (like after running for 20 minutes), the resis-
tance should be close to zero.  Probably less than 100 Ohms.

	Yeah, you pretty much just open it up and clean it out.

	If you have Web access, there's a really really wonderful article on
the D-jet system by Kjell Nelin on Tim's 914 Fan Page,
http://www.estinc.com/porsche

	Good luck!
