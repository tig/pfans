I must have my definition of a parsec messed up.  I was under the
impression that it worked like this...  Draw two lines from your eye out
into space, with the angle between the two lines being equivalent to 1
second of an arc.  At the point that the distance between the two lines
is equal to 1 light year, the distance of either one of the two lines is
equal to a parsec.  I think this is right, because I distinctly remember
hearing that the visible universe is in the neighborhood of 20 parsecs.
Your definition would define that as a little over 60 light years, and
we all know it's much further than that... My calculations would pin a
parsec at 206,264.8 light years, making the visible universe equal to
4,125,296 light years.  This sounds more reasonable than a little over
60.  So, if I have my definition of a Parsec wrong, then what distance
am I describing?  

(Yeah, this has LOTS to do with Porsches....)
