2. I broke the throttle cable (at the pedal end, the crimp failed) on my '73
914 2.0 on a date one night (about 1980 or so, can you say "starving college
student"?).  By pulling the cable out of the sheath and routing it around a
large screwdriver stuck into the engine cover latch, I was able to (kind of)
set up a hand-operated throttle control by pulling on the cable with my arm
hanging out the window. It was enough to allow us to drive home (to get the
Fiat, go figure!), and was actually kind of fun, as my date had to shift the
trans (I was way too busy and not very coordinated to begin with!).

	Hey, my throttle cable brokr too. (and clutch, and heater.  No
	front trunk yet though).  I was going to go back and set the 
	idle up really high but when I got there I found  that the
	cable pulled out easily.  I routed it through the passenger
	window and just pulled on it when it was time to go.  I'm 
	glad this car has no power (well I was at THAT moment) because
	all I could really manage was on or off, no in between.  I
	just kept it in too tall a gear and was not much of a problem.
	Had cable lube everywhere.
