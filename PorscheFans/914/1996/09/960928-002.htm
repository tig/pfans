In the Pittsburgh PA area I can highly recommend C & G Performance;
one owner George Riggin ("G" of "C&G")  has an Audi 200 Quattro wagon
with approx. 100,000 miles that he loves.

By the way, this shop has pulled so much work from the local Porsche
shops that one dealer sold them all of his high performance stock!

 I don't blame an Audi shop for not being in love with the marque.  H*ll,
 I'm not either.  I just found it met my requirements better then the rest,
 as I suspect it met many of yours.  Why else would we put up with these
 things?  My current shop I would recommend to anyone, but it's their
 competence, not their love of Audis.
