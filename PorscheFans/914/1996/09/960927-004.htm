Thanks to everyone who responded to my
ignorance of my heater controls. 

Is there an archive for this list?
I am sure it would be a great source for 
information and entertaining reading.

Can anyone tell me the differance between
the 914 engine and the VW type IV?

Is it the exaust valves, the case, the cam,
all of the above, none of the above????

I have heard you can replace the tranny
syncros without removing the tranny from 
car. Has anyone here done this? Do i need
a jig to set the tranny gears up??

I ONCE pulled the tranny out of a VW bettle.
After pulling the engine and transaxle out 
of the car you must pull the differancial
from the transaxle and unbolt the transmition
from inside the diff housing.. Then it needed
to have the trans set up in a jig...

I love my 914.

OK...here we go, here's what I think;

I just recently went through my entire ignition and fuel system on my '74
2.0L.  You did not indicate what 914 you're driving so I will base this answer
on DJet (1.7-2.0 cars) system maintenance.  I have just been through most of
this...your idle problem could be just about anywhere...so we'll do this
systematically.
a. DO NOT screw around with the throttle body switch...not right now, leave it
alone for the time being.
b. an inconsistent idle is symptomatic of;
- improper ECU mixture setting
- a vacumn leak
- dead temp sensor (located over #3 cylinder
- a malfunctioning Aux air valve (located just forward of throttle body)

Let's take these areas one-by-one:
- ECU MIXTURE SETTING
There is a knob on the left hand side of your brain...(no, no, no... the one
in the car!! :)) the brain is that box located just forward of the battery. 
This guy makes all the decisions regarding fuel, air mix.  Turning the knob
clockwise is rich, counterclockwise is lean.  These things are very reliable. 
OK,  lets assume that everything else (see below) is perfect, and you want to
adjust the mixture; with the engine running, what you do here is turn knob
counterclockwise (to lean it out) until the engine starts gagging, and then
turn clockwise until you hit the sweet spot.  Also, (what I did was) turn the
mixture screw all the way in on the throttle body -it's located over on
drivers side of t-body.

- VACUMN LEAKS
these are a royal PITA to track down...DJets require just about perfect
sealing...which this means is that EACH and EVERY hose in there needs to be
tight.  What I did here was bite the bullet and bought all new hose(s) and
replaced everything.  this way you'll KNOW that you won't have a bad, leaky,
hose connection...Please change those four big intake hoses too, you won't
regret it.  Mine crumbled off, they were so old (original?) There are also
gaskets at the base of the intake runners, as they attach to the head(s) these
guys are pretty solid, but you're going to take the runners off to change the
manifold hoses anyway, so change these guys at the base too.  This is very
cheap insurance. so, your first move (IMO) is to completely renew your hose
layout.  Use GOOD hose...I used the factory, fabric-woven stuff.  Little
pricey but I didn't care.  I got mine from the local Beck-Arnley guy.  I've
been told that GPR has all this OEM hose, but look around.
ALSO, whatever you do, DO NOT put a screw in in the hole on the butterfly
valve in the throttle body, all that does is cover up the real problem.  If
there's a screw there, take it out.

- TEMP SENSOR
now we can assume that your hoses are tight and the car still hunts at idle. 
the question now is; does the hunting get worse as the car warms up? if it
does, then your Temp Sensor is suspect...this guy lives over the #3 cylinder,
mounted right in the head.  you'll need to remove the intake runner to
properly access this thing (well, mebbe not, but I took my runner off-made
this task real easy)  BE REAL CAREFUL removing old sensor and installing new
sensor.  The head is aluminum-it WILL strip very easily, so don't get in a
"new york hurry" here.  Also, the sensor really needs an inline resistor
attached to it to work properly. A 13mm(I think) deep socket works well..you
can cram all the wire right up in it. The sensor itself is a real small piece.
 This sensor is responsible for sending the proper temperature data to the
ECU.  if the sensor is dead, the ECU can't make a decision and the hunting
will be a result.  Dead temp sensors are real common. this is about a
$15.00-$20.00 part.

-AUX AIR VALVE
this guy is located just forward of the throttle body.  This part won't cause
a idle hunting problem...but it will give you a high idle if it's not working.
 The way to check it is to start the engine, while it's still cold, pull the
hose leading to the AA valve off of the air cleaner and put your thumb over
it. If youre getting vacumn, then it's working.  When the engine warms up,
this vacumn will go away.  The AA valve is a NLA part (I think) there are
people on this list that kow how to rebuild them.. I think Dave Darling is
one-you might ask him about this.  But the AA valve won't be the cause of
inconsistent hunting idle.  When you fix everything else above, and you've got
a nice, even 1800rpm idle (which is too high)...that's when you want to
suspect the AA valve because it probably won't be working...or hooked up

With the help of various people on this list, I've got my '74 running damn
near perfect...Ralph Ricks is a monster troubleshooter, and he is around on
the list...the guy travels alot, so you might not hear from him right away. 
Just keep asking questions and you'll get there eventually. These cars aren't
tough, if you approach them systematically. 
I suggest you look at these areas before you start playing with the throttle
body switch...I don't think that's your problem.
