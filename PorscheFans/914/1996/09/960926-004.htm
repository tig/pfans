	You know it took too long to fix the car when:

Your neighbor's dog barks at the car, even though he never
barks at you or your "other" car.

That wine you bought to celebrate the final repair has turned
to vinegar.

Your "other" car has had two "Major Service" intervals since
the last time you drove your "toy".

Your friends ask you if you've bought a new car.

Your're surprised every time you see the garage without your
car up on jackstands.

You still have a tankfull of "pre-reformulated" gas in the car.


	The sad part is, all but one of these are literally
true.  Except maybe the vinegar one; I haven't opened up that
bottle yet.
