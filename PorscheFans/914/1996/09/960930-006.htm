Daniel:

You may want to investigate the actual market value of a 914-6, both
in your car's current condition and fully restored.  The Porsche
Market Letter or the Pano classifieds would be good places to start.

I don't know how you define "worth a lot finished and still a good
bit unfinished", but I fear that you may be surprised to discover
that your car is worth less than the 911SC for which you want to swap
it.
