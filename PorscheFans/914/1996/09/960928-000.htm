Hey, this list of anecdotes is a great idea, we have all heard
many amusing stories, I am sure a compliation would be great!

(1) I heard once about a jeep in the middle of the Kalahari,
which developed a major case of auto-brochitis, false air to
make it cough but not run at all.  Miles away from paved road
let alone auto-spares, they had one of the men ride sitting on
the hood!, and cover an opening over the air-intake with his
hand, at driver command -- a cordless throttle if you will :-)

(2) OK, how about a on-the-road story -- a road-side hack
without even getting out of the car ?

Late on a Sunday, driving out to a music show, my clutch pedal
just went limp (924, cable clutch) -- Anyway, by this time I had
the transmission charts from the owners manual committed to
memory, as I was polishing my rev-matching skills. I surprised
myself to find that I could shift without the clutch just by
working the pedals by the numbers.

Select a straight stretch of empty road to coast, match engine
revs so that the stick slips out real easy, lookup (from memory)
revs for current mph and target gear, kick gas to that revs and
gently slip the gears in. A bit cerebral, but easy.

Doing that while trying to not reach a lights just while it was
turning green too early to have to slow down -- now that was
fun!  :-)

It did freak out my passenger, however, to see the left foot
completely idle -- all the way to the concert, and back. We took
the long route; cruising speeds were OK, but stop lights were a
pain worth avoiding.

(3) "Rev-matching" reminds me of another much discussed
"technique" -- heel-and-toe -- I put that to good use on a
friend's civic with a bad case of "will not idle".
