	RE: 914's running out of breath below rev limiter.

I seem to have the exact opposite observation.  My 914 runs right into
the rev limiter, not out of breath.  It seems that the perfect shift point
is right at the rev limiter, and may be a little beyond it.  It doesnt have
much torque anywhere in the band but it certainly doesn't drop off 
perceptively before the limit.
Take my other car (PLEEZE).  It has a GM 3.1 w/ 5 speed. REd line at 6000,
yellow at 5500.  Above 5000 all it does is buzz and make noise but acceleration
goes down the toilet.  Natural shift point is well below the rev limiter.
Hell I didn't even know it had a rev limiter, and when I read the shop manual
I thought it was wrong.  I took a test drive and discovered it to be true
at 6200 but I have never hit it in anger.  I have autocrossed that car for a couple
of seasons and never have hit it.  The 914 reminds me every day that it has
a limiter on the way to work.
