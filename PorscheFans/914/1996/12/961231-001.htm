I notice an interesting trend in the list members that have mentioned a
little about themselves. Most are either in their late 20's to mid 30's
now, or were in that age range 20 years ago when the 914's were still new.

I am 36 years old, married over 12 years, and work as an interface and
usability designer for a software company. I live in Atlanta and have a
moderate, but mostly opposing traffic, commute to work. The 914 is my
'weekend' car, but during nice weather tends to become the daily driver.

My involvement in Porsches and interest in the 914 was as a background
participant for many years while a close friend owned one starting in our
college days back in 1983. It was not until 1995 when he startled me by
announcing that he was selling his 914 that I ever considered owning one. I
bought his before he had a chance to mention it to anyone else.

My 73 914 is Olympic Blue (to save you digging out your color charts, it is
that baby/sky blue that was only available on the 73 and 74 model years).
It has been well restored and could easily be concoured. It was converted
to Weber carbs back in the late 70's. It also had the original wheels
replaced with Minilites -- which look wonderful on a 914 and give it a
somewhat more timeless look. 

This car has had a little notariety -- it appeared on the cover of Aug 1983
Pano and at the beginning of the article on '914 Numerology' in the June
1995 Pano.

While I am a member of PCA, I am not very active in club events. I bought
the 914 because I liked the 914 -- not because I had a particular desire to
own a Porsche, get in with the Porsche crowd, or own a babe magnet. I am
also a member of both 914 clubs, and I will attend any 914 events that are
fairly close to where I live.

My interest is mainly in driving and enjoying the car. My auto knowledge
and experience is mostly with cosmetic maintenance and restoration -- I
know little about the mechanics.
