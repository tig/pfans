Here I am, one more time, by REQUEST, to blitz this where it may be helpful
to you. If not, just ignore it.

This is my answer:

It is not hard to do. Just have to be extremely careful or you can ruin the
throttle body.
I had made a fixture to hold the throttle body in a precise and positive
position. My tolerance was +.002 max for the alignment to be correct.
Experience held it at .000 for true alignment.
The mounting that holds the TB to the engine has 2 slots.  The part of the
TB where the black switch is affixed to the TB is used as a base to assure
squareness  and alignment of the bosses you will bore to install the oil
lite BRONZE bushings.

Items you will need:
1/2"x3x3x6"piece of angle iron that hasTRUE 90 degrees inside surfaces to
each other. GRIND SURFACE!
1/4" and 1/2" drill bits.
5/16-18 tap
5/16-18  x 3/4" hex head bolts (2).
tap handle
5/16" drill blank or 5"16"  transfer punch(new, minimum length of 5").
..3745 reamer, no smaller or larger. This is crucial for aluminum press fit.
8mm reamer
7/16" dia. x 3" length aluminum pin, undercut to 5/16" dia. x 3/4" long one
end for BRONZE bushing press fit.
3/8" Outer Diameter  x 3/4" long oil lite bronze bushings, 8mm inner diameter.
3/8" Outer Diameter  x 7/8" long oil lite bronze bushings, 8mm inner diameter.
small strip of crocus paper for polish throttle shaft.
Lots of patience, no hurry attitude, since you are doing it for yourself,
to do it RIGHT.

 1. Make a fixture, 1/2"x3" x 3"x6" length angle iron. The reason the angle
iron is 6" long is for you to use mill clamps to hold it in a flat and
positive true position when boring.

2. Set the TB on this and using a transfer punch of 5/16" diameter, spot
with the punch thru the 2 slots that normally hold the TB to the top of
engine. You will drill and tap the punch mark to 5/16-18 threads for holding
the TB flat against that plane surface. You MUST be certain that the switch
base is held flat when doing this.

3.Drill a 1/2" hole through the angle bar. You will determine this hole
position by inserting a transfer punch through the existing hole(boss) that
the throttle shaft sits in when it was assembled earlier. This transfer
punch size is 5/16" also. This is not critical as the hole will be where the
waste goes as you bore this hole. Just keep it fairly close. To the right of
this 1/2" hole, EXACTLY 5/8"fom the center of 1/2" hole, drill a 3/8" hole
thru the angle iron. Right is the same plane as with TB in fixture. The 3/8"
hole is to accomadate the tang that is at the top of the throttle body at
upper shaft boss hole. You will have to have this hole for true alignment to
press the lower BRONZE bushing in when instructed below.

4.Determine that the bore location is correct by inserting a 5/16" transfer
punch or drill blank into a collet in the mill head. This height should be
high enough from the TB fixture to allow full stroke of milling head with TB
installed as instructed earlier. Now, using the mill head spindle with the
5/16" transfer punch or drill blank in it, pull it down with the mill handle
that is on the side of the mill head. This should be with no switches turned
on. You should not feel ANY resistance as you do this. When you are
satisfied that the alignment is dead true, and the drill blank or transfer
punch is now protruding the entire length of the TB boss, CLAMP the fixture
in place. Feel of the punch or blank should be fluid without any binding as
you pull handle up and down again. Keep in mind that you are repairing a
worn surface so dial indicating should NOT be used to align. It will mess
you up.

5.You are now ready to bore. Remove the punch and collet from the milling
machine. Install the boring head and bore the boss completely thru the
length, one side to the other to about .350 or so. Install a 3/8" collet
with a  .3745 +.000- .000 reamer and ream TB. Spindle speed should be around
100 rpm. Use kerosene as a lubricant, use it  abundantly. This completes the
boring/reaming for the TB in this operation.

6.Using a pin that is machined for this purpose, set the longer of the 2
required oil lite BRONZE bushings onto the machined end of the pin and press
it into the upper hole while you still have the fixture in position.

7.Remove TB from fixture and reverse ends. Bolt back to fixture with the
tang now on the bottom sitting in the 3/8" hole you drilled earlier for this
purpose. Use the 7/16" aluminum pin with the short BUSHING slid up on the
pin, press bushing until pin bottoms out against the recessed hole.

8.Ream 8mm reamer completely thru BOTH bushing, while TB is still bolted to
the fixture.

9. The shaft from Porsche is 8mm. Polish it bright to get good fluid motion
when reinstalled.

10.Clean your TB with procedure I posted earlier on this list.

You have now rebuilt your throtle body. Don't you wish you had let the
Southern Knight do it for $43???? and that included total cleaning of TB and
its accessories, high speed polishing of the complete unit, repair of the
worn idle threads in some cases,  plus setting the throttle switch back to
factory specs not to mention the return postage. 

Question.. What kept you from sending them.  Was the price too high? Service
too slow? What? Those few that did send for repair had nothing but praise
for the "ART" I did to theirs. I really would like mail on this lack of
response, but only to my e-mail address, as not to waste band width on the
list, as I did earlier.

NOTE: For those who are adventurers, you can do this with an ordinary LONG
spindle stroke drill press if you follow each step with extreme care.
However, doing so is a risk that you alone are responsible for.  If you do,
make damn certain that you know what you are doing or you will ruin it.
FIXTURE must NOT be moved once you start process. Repeat:  FIXTURE must NOT
be moved once you start process. DO AT YOUR OWN RISK.

repairs.
