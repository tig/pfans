Thanks for sharing your small biography with the list. It was an honor and
priviledge to meet each of you.
To those that did not respond to "Getting to know you", I possibly don't
know who you are, but you know. 
Happy New year to ALL of you.

All that have not became a member of PCA, should do so. It is, for those who
want it to be, the prime example of the gathering of all Porsche models for
fun, companionship and events that you will remember for the rest of your
life. Support PCA. It supports you, the INDIVIDUALIST, a  Porsche owner.

 A good resolution might be, hey, these are interesting people on this list
and I want to become a person who lets the world know who I am, how I feel
about my 914, what I am doing or intending to do to prolong its heritage and
show the rest of the world, what a life WAVE I am having with my 914.

Said in a song, " Its'  gonna take time,..... a whole lot of precious
time.....and money.....to do it right".

Suggested project for our list: Electrical diagram showing components,
engine compartment, in a pictorial manner much like the fine illustrations
done by Dave Darling illustrating the hose sizes and locations. Surely, with
all the engineering talents on this list, this can be done easily for the
different model years. Schematics are already avaliable, but the schematics
are easily misunderstood by those not trained in electronics. 

Good or bad, it is important to share the thrills and the agony, your
problems and your solutions and to help others. Helping others is a feeling
that can makes you feel good...... every day of the year!

If the net had been around in those early years, the innovation that is
generated from all you owners through your input, perhaps Porsche would
still be manufacturing the 914 with your improvements of today. Then again,
the work forces of today are content with being labeled team players and
associates. It takes an INDIVIDUAL to own a different kind of car that we
all love, that most of us appreciate, the Porsche 914.

Be courteous, be safe and may the power of friendship, knowledge and the 914
be ours in 1997.
