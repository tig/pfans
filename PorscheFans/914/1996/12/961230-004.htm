Hey all, after being chastised by "elder" Cooley not once, but twice for
not responding, I'll add a quick "bio" ;).

I'm 32, married to a wonderful woman for 10 years, and father of three:
2 sons, ages 6 and 4, and an 18 month old daughter. I'm a physician in
the Army which keeps things pretty busy. In left-over time, being a
father takes priority. Also, we're a Christian family, and spend a lot
of time at church as bible study teachers.

In the automotive realm, we own a '95 Windstar (family mover and tow
vehicle) "Miss Piggy;" a '59 Triumph TR3A "Kermit," currently undergoing
a resto by someone who has the time and knows what he is doing; and my
daily driver, a beautiful white '75 914 1.8, still un-named. Like
someone else on the list, I got my 914 at AA about 10 months ago after
an accident totalled my previous daily driver. I had literally a weekend
to get a "new" car or else rent while looking. I was treated fairly
poorly, and I find now that I too paid probably 20% more than the going
rate on this and Tim's/Renegade lists, but in return I got a very-low
rust specimen that had only 90k miles and has needed only two
oil-changes and a clutch-tube repair in 10 months and 10,000 miles. I
feel in retrospect I got a fair deal.

I'm a true lurker, this being my first post since joining in the summer.
I've been grateful for all the info I've gotten from the more
experienced folks here. Rich Johnson is in the process of building for
me a set of modified Boge 911 struts with big four piston Brembo's (944
turbo donor) up front. It should be a great upgrade and indoctrination
into the world of true "wrenching." I plan to sort out the suspension
next, followed by paint and interior. I'd like eventually to put in a
stock 3.2 complete with Motronics FI, but I've got a lot of research to
do first, not to mention paying off Miss Piggy, and the resto on Kermit.

We're hoping to get to Germany for our next assignment beginning this
summer. If we do, I'd love to take the 914 back to her homeland for a
little Bahn-storming. We'll let you know.

Thanks for the bandwidth and the ongoing great info.
Gary Wheeler
