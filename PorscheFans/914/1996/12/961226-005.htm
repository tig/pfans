Sad Tidings, 914-er's....

  Let me give you a little background...   Once upon a time, there was a 
great library in Alexandria, Egypt, containing almost all of the 
knowledge amassed by the human race up to that time.  It included 
some knowledge that remains lost to this day.  The reason that 
priceless manuscripts, objects de art, and irreplaceable knowledge has 
been lost for all time, is that the Romans burned the library to the 
ground.
  The Roman legions have been on the march again, apparently.  This 
time through Wolfsburg.  I have just received a long-awaited reply to 
my question to VW concerning 914 cylinder head temperature.
  For those of you who are even later arrivals on this list than I am, I will 
just say that I have been pursuing hard data on the subject of cylinder 
head temperatures for some time; a letter to Porsche requesting the 
normal range of cylinder head temperatures for the 914 4-banger was 
replied to most graciously, but with the essential idea being that "we 
don't know; VW built the engine; ask them".  A similar letter to VW has 
now been answered, again most graciously... only... the people at VW 
were most kind, in that they photo-copied a large portion of the shop 
manual on the engine and sent it to me, and even were kind enough to 
return the postage that I had sent them, but the gist of the 
accompaning letter is that this is all the information that they posess.  
  Alas... unless someone on the list knows a retired VW engineer who 
had something to do with air-cooled flat four development, the actual 
design parameters are lost to mankind forever... the best that I have 
been able to discover is red line temperatures for two different types of 
aircraft engines, and a (shudder) Corvair!
  Amoung the lost first folios, Gutenberg bibles, and Bach scores, we 
must now include the engineering design details for our beloved 
air-cooled flat fours.
  I suggest that we declare an official day of mourning...

				Regards,
				Jim T.
