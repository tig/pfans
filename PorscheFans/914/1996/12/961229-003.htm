My name is Gary, and I have a problem:  I'm a motorhead.

My problem is made even worse by the presence of a 914
ignition key in my pocket.

For those of you collecting demographics:  Married, one child,
40, abrasive *and* arrogant.  Living in San Francisco, but
planning a move to the "land of larger garages".

My first car was a '62 AH Sprite.  My oldest brother gave it
to me on the condition he never see it again.  "Oh, and by the
way, it's at the bottom of a ramp, and it has *no* clutch."

That was followed by enough cars that if I listed them it would
reduce Internet bandwidth for a while.

But I'd always *wanted* a 914.  About 5 years ago, while I was
west-bound on I80-west, a gentleman south-bound on the same
road convinced me it was time to sell my (16V Scirocco) car.
With the money from his insurance company, I would up buying
three:  Red, green, and blue.

The red one was a '74 2.0 that the P.O. had managed to break
everything on.  I once borrowed a spark-plug wrench from a
motorcycle CHP to get it back home.

The blue one is a '73 1.7 with a perfect factory body.  Never
been dented or dinged.  HUGH rust under the battery tray.

The green one was a '73 2.0 with even more rust, and had been
butchered to install A/C.  It was a parts car for the other two.

The red one got sold to some kid that also needed a 914; it was
a fun car, and I'm sure he's learning about cars the same way
I did.

I had the rust fixed on the blue one.  And now I'm in the process
of building one car out of all the bits I have around.  The
suspension is done, brakes are next, and I'm saving the engine
for last.  Hopefully it will be done *before* the kid is old
enough to drive.....

Gary.
