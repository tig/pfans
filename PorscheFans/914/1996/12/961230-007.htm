	Hi, all!  I'm back!  Many many thanks to the Four in Portland
for hospitality, comraderie, and showing off their 914's!  Also to
whomever set-up the Archives--very useful, those are.

	For Jim T:  The Little Spec Book might have a number for you;
it has some stuff that didn't seem to make it into the Factory Shop
Manual for some reason.
	I didn't know the original nuts were copper/brass, mine were
just plain CORRODED, the half that were the right kind.  They were
also $11 each from the dealer ($8 with the Porschfans discount from
Linda at Carlsen's!).  So I bought the $0.80 ones from GPR instead.
They're almost identical--a bit shorter, copper-coated (but they seem
to still be steel), built-in "washer" flange, but you use a 12mm
socket on them instead of 13mm.  This, to me, is a Good Thing--I
could not get the 13mm socket onto some of the nuts very easily, due
to restricted clearance.  The 12mm, being just a little smaller over-
all diameter, fits in much easier.

	For Ralph Ricks:  Auto Parts Club up here in the Bay Area had
the green Bosch injectors (listed as correct for the 2.0) for just
over $50 each new.  This was a year ago, hopefully the prices haven't
gone up too much since.  Some mail-order outfits (see ads in Pano) have
advertised them for a bit less.  Linda at Carlsen Porsche in Palo Alto
CA will find them for you at a reasonable price.  Tell her you're a
Porschefan (e-mail list) and that I sent you.  You can e-mail her at
pic4parts@aol.com, but the 800-number is faster.  800/523-2408

	See ya!
