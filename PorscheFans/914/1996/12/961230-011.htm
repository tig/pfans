Thanks to all who responded regarding the thermostat question I had.  Yes,
I should check my Haynes manual before I ask you guys.  As the manual said,
1.81 inches at 65 degrees celsius.  The old, corroded, crusty dirty
thermostat was right on the money.

Santa was good to me too, a new mild performance F.I. cam from FAT for my
2.0l.  Say, does anyone have this cam, and how is it working out?

Regards,

Dion
