Hi.  After years of messing with cheap Rabbits ($400, $200, and $0), I
decided to buy
something more fun. Living in California it had to be convertible.
After driving a few things, I tried an acquantance's 914 and was hooked!
The shifter was balky, the interior beat up, but it felt good!

After watching the ads, I bought a '71 914 1.7 (at night!) for $2100.
(Did not know much about the car then.)

That was six years ago. Since then I have replaced the clutch (myself),
upgraded
to a sideshifter tranny (myself), upgraded the suspension, painted it, and
put some A-032's
on it. And added the luxury-car touch: earplugs.

One of these days, I plan to try autocrossing.
Meanwhile, the 914 seems normal, other cars just seem like boats.

BTW, when I was 17 I stumbled into a Porsche dealership, saw a new '71 914,
and fell in love. Is it coincidence that I have one now?

A 6 would be nice (would then compete with the pickup on my wife's Volvo).
Or failing that, I would settle for a Boxster. ;-)
