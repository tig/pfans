Hi folks,

I just got the messages about the 914 trannie cover cleanup. Thanks.

Here is what I did: I talked to the owner of the local repair place. He is
very good, very honest, and very hard working. He offered me to use his 
parts cleaning sink to do the job; he also suggested that I go to a local 
'hand' carwash place to see if they would do it. They said yes. For 
$20-25 bucks (not sure since they did some other stuff and just asked for one
payment for everything), they really cleanup the outside, it is whitish 
and very clean. I am very happy.

I then took the rear cover off; it appears in very good shape inside, the 
gears  I can see (1st and reverse) have no obvious damage, they dont even 
look worn in any way.

Fred, who owns the car with me made a great suggestion: We called a great
local Porsche-only repair place. We really like the guys who own it. We
asked them if we could bring this trannie to their shop in dead of winter
when it is more quiet for them and pay them for their time (when needed)
as we tear the trannie apart. (Our tools, our trannie, our new gasket set,
new bushings, etc.)

They said yes. They told me that once we take the gears out, and they tell
us what needs to be replaced that we can either decide that the number of
parts needed are too much cost; or that we don't need a lot of new parts; 
or even none. Then if we decide to go ahead and buy the replacements, we
come back to the shop and they help us (mostly with advice) to put it
together and replace the one in our 914 -- which has very loud 1st and 2nd
synchros -- like non-existant synchros.

Then maybe we rebuild that one on our time only. What fun!

I will keep you posting on this project. With the Factory shop book and 
the Haynes book -- which has a good chapter on the transmission -- and 
our 'teachers' we can really have a great old time!!!

Mark
