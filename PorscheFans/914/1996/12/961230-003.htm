I hear you!  I've stripped every single one of mine, more than once!  I
wouldn't use much more than 14lbs, and I'd re-check them after a week of
driving.  I don't recall what the book says, but I think it's somewhere
around 14lbs.  Also, when I bought my car, the studs had been replaced
with Allen head bolts.  I highly recommend to anyone with bolts rather
than studs to switch back to studs!  For some reason, the bolts just
pull out way to easily.

Hope this helps!
