Hi folks and thanks for the advice on the non-starting 914. And on trannie
stuff. 

I finally figured out the non-start problem. And it is unbelievable:

	We had 2 (!) intermittent relays on the relay board.

Testing them by exchanging with the working heater blower relay showed 
me, I had thought, that they all 3 were good. But then today one of them
was intermittent, and another was intermittent and worse than the first. 
So I had sometimes power to the fuel pump, and sometimes the power relay
would cut out and combinations thereof. I simply took both of these
relays, threw them into the garbage, and put in my two spares. (Smart to 
keep spares, huh! But i am stupid too sometimes. I should have tried the 
spares earlier).

Car runs great. Starts right up. Doesn't stall (yet!) in hard right turns....

As for cleaning the spare transmission housing: I will talk to my friend
in the 'hand' car wash place...I have no easy place to spray water around
to clean up the gunk on the outside, he does, and he is reasonable....on
to trannie disassembly... 

Mark
