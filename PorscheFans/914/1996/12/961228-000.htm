I was just informed that the 914 is still being manufactured. Called a
Boxter. With this error in my earlier message, I now withdraw all previous
mis-information. I will not post again after this message. 

Just shows I don't know what I am talking about relative to the 914.  Any
future mail from me is futile.

It was fun, living in the past, when I could afford these memories and being
an individual. Retirement is boring when you live as I do, on the brink of
poverty, because of downsizing or better words, greed and control of your
destiny by corporations. They are the hole in the donut without the
employees that made it what it is today. You don't know until it happens to
you, and it will happen to some of you. Being a team player is good if you
know what game you are playing, bad if you don't.

Being ousted from your work is demeaning. If over 50, you will have a very
hard time finding a job, especially if you were making good money. That is
why you will be ousted. You will scramble looking for a way to meet the
monthlys. Your past wages will make your resumes be trashed. You will use
ALL your savings to survive. You will accept an earlier retirement with
substantial loss of money  if old enough to retire. You will lose self
esteem and look upon yourself as a loser. Your family will suffer from
embarrassment to be social as before.
You will be forced to apply for work at minimum wage as your reward for
being a loyal employee. Some people who have wealth from their earlier
family fortune, maybe inheritence, then this will not apply.

 I have applied at more than 200 places in the last year and on this day,
have failed to obtain employment or even hear anything futher from these
applications, even though they are still seeking help in advertisements.
 Again, must mention that I am a highly skilled machinist with
qualifications to do a good job, but prior pay level was shown on
applications. I did get a temporary, very hot job at previous employer, at
naturally, reduced wages until the well went dry from completion of task.

My wife nearly died in October.  We could not afford the insurance, after
living off of our savings for a year. We were wiped out. I have held onto
the 914 because it represents a better time in our life. Besides, in its
present condition it has no monetary value. All that is done to it is what
my skills allow without any cost. I tried to supplement the small retirement
with the throttle body rebuilding. When this failed to make ANY money, I
sold the machinery as I said in an earlier message to the list. Next will be
our home. The cost of my net use is provided by someone I did a favor for
several years ago. They would not accept NO for my answer.

I am NOT a PCA member. I was when affordable. You, who can afford, join a
local PCA. You will love it.

This message is not seeking any sympathy, nor anything, for that matter.
Just to make you be wary of what most think only happen to others. 

With apologies to a great list on this non porsche content. This is not
whining, just the truth.

Thanks for the friendship,

Mike Cooley
Memphis, Tn.


If the net had been around in those early years, the innovation that is
generated from all you owners through your input, perhaps Porsche would
still be manufacturing the 914 with your improvements of today. Then again,
the work forces of today are content with being labeled team players and
associates. It takes an INDIVIDUAL to own a different kind of car that we
all love, that most of us appreciate, the Porsche 914.
