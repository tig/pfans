You have to look very closely to determine wear in gears. First speed 
drive gear (the small one) is subjected to the most stress, and tends to 
crack. Also, after you wipe the old gear oil off of it, you can have a 
closer look. Check for a wear line across the face of the teeth near the 
base circle on one side only. Typically, a spawl line appears there. 
Also, after removing the roll pin and the castelated nut, use a puller to 
get the gear off if it doesn't slide off easily. Then, wipe the gear 
clean and hold it up closely ans look for cracks. If your first speed 
drive gear is either cracked or has spawl lines, I would replace the 
pair. Gears have to be replaced in pairs, and first speed is expensive.

As you will note from the factory manual, if you have to replace any 
bearings, then you have to go through the ring and pinion setup 
procedure, which requires some very expensive tools. I had to replace the 
two ball bearings in the intermediate plate, but I'm winding up replacing 
all of them. I don't want to have to tear this apart again because I was 
too cheap to replace them all. O yeah, the 4 bearings for the 
transmission shafts are over 100$ each. These bearings are now over 20 
years old, and have most likely exceeded thier replacement interval. 
Since Porsche recommends a 12,000 mile oil service interval, and 
virtually nobody does that for 20 odd years, then you can bet that your 
bearings are less than optimal and don't have very much life left in 
them. Jeff Chandler (of JCM) says that the worst wear occurs on the inner 
race, which you can't see. So if the outer race looks at all worn, it's 
best to replace the bearing. 

You don't have to buy the synchro installation tools that many places
sell. I've come up with a simple way to install them using the clutch
collars. You'll need a pair of large snap ring pliers to remove the spring
washers. JCM transmissions has a set of 5 synchros for 95$, which is the
cheapest I've found. 

Check the radial play in the shift rod holes in the intermediate plate. 


There's a spec in the haynes manual, and they typically wear because the 
hard steel slides directly in the soft magnesium. Mine are worn, so I 
bought a set of bronze bushings, and I'm going to attempt to save my 
intermediate plate by having the holes bored and sleeved. Otherwise, it's 
400$ for a replacement intermediate plate.  

			Fight Smog II and "clunker" laws!
