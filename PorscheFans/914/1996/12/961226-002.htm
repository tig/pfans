Mike Cooley's posting finally got me moving on doing my own.

My name is Ken Korn. I turned 58 last September (3rd oldest on the list, 
Mike?), am married to the same gal since 1962, have two grown children, and a 
Lakeland Terrier. We live in Austin TX, moving here 10 years ago from 
Wisconsin.

My first encounter with a Porsche was about 1960 when I sat in a Speedster at 
Pabst Motors (run by Augie Pabst) in Milwaukee. I have wanted a 356 for many 
years and never had one. Motorcycles have had my interest for the last 15 
years or so. I've owned about 11 BMW's during that time and currently have 3 
in the garage. I enjoy wrenching almost as much as riding.

About 2 years ago I sold a 1956 BMW R50 twin to a woman in her 40's. Her daily 
driver was a 914 that she had owned for about 12 years. Her SO also has a 914. 
It's all her fault that I bought my 74 914 2.0 in Feb 96, and began its 
restoration.

It belonged to a fellow who started a new restaurant about 5 years ago and 
parked the poor Pcar under a tree and left it. It has been interesting, 
challenging, and fun to repair and restore. I recently got it back from the 
body shop with a new Alaska Blue Metallic paint job.

I really enjoy the mailing lists. I was on a BMW motorcycle list which had a 
few hundred members and it was very satisfying. It now is up around 1300 and I 
can't keep up with the babble. The 914 list we have is great and is small 
enough that we might just be able to KNOW each other.

That's about it for the autobiography. Happy Holidays to all.

Ken
