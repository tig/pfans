Hello All and a Merry X-MAS!!!

   Well I met with Dave Darling yesterday and it was a great time.  Dave is a
great guy and we had a lot to talk about.  We even went for a ride in my 73
2.0L and he seemed quite pleased with how it ran.  Like others though he did
not like the kit that was installed on the car.  He was amazed that I had
265/50 on the rear and 225/50 up front.  Inside and out it is a very clean car
and I was more than happy to share my baby with Dave.  Well on a different note
it is 1:30 am here in Portland OR and I am unfortunately at work yes that is
right 1:30 in the morning on X-MAS and I am working.  Even worse I don't get to
go home until 8 am and get the great honor of returning at 6 pm for another
whole 13 hours.  Gotta love the Holidays.....But just think about all that
money that I can invest into you know what.  Enough said, I hope you all have a
wonderful X-MAS and a safe and HAPPY NEW YEAR.

If it wasn't for Porsche's there wouldn't be any need for dreams......
