Greetings All!

I am a relative newcomer to the list, though I've been flogging 914's
for about 20 years.  Had my first spin (literally) in my father's 914/6
at an autocross in 1976, and never looked back.  Well, I have, on
occasion, been looking through the rear window to see where I was going,
but that's another story.

I first started driving an EP 356.  My first 914 was a very, very
faithful '73 1.7, which I used for track events, time trials,
autocrosses, and top-off driving.  Through some accident of divine
providence, when I lowered the car the corner weights must have been
absolutely perfect, because the car was easily the best balanced I've
ever driven, including racecars.  Some days in the rain, it was the
fastest car on the track.  Unfortunately, my ex spun it into a bridge
abutment driving on a slick highway, so I never got the chance to find
out what the weights were.  We then donated the engine to my sister's
914, and it's still running strong some 10 years later, FI and all.

I aquired an original-owner 914/6 (#499) in 1982, rebuilt the original
'T' motor after a chain tensioner failure (happened with brand new
"turbo" tensioners, so go with either machanicals or pressure-fed!), and
used it for track events and time trials (winning the old Porsche
Atlantic Time Trial Series in the stock class) for another 10 years,
before the cam tower glue gave out.  During that time it's been lowered,
raised, de-cambered, cambered, 916-ed, bumpered, well, you get the idea.
 These days it's happy with a 2.4 E, and over-due for some metal work
and paint.  Now that I'm racing a 911, perhaps it's time.

My track experience includes Pocono, Lime Rock, Summit Pt, the Glen,
Mosport, Mid-Ohio, Road America, Daytona, Atlanta, Blackhawk, MIS, and
IRP.  I've also done instructing stints with Bob Bondurant, Ford,
Merkur, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, and Driving Dynamics.

There are, of course, lots of great stories to accomany all this, but
unfortunately, most of them are *about* me, so I'm really not the one to
tell them.

My father still has his 914/6, a '56 356, and a '68 911.  My sister and
brother-in-law have a '74 914, and a '68 912.  I've still got whats left
of the '73 914, my 914/6, and a '72 911S.

I hope that I can contibute something to the list, since I've had mine
apart and together many times (sometimes even with tools and a garage!),
and broken just about everything that can be. 

Happy Holidays to all!

Michael Keller
