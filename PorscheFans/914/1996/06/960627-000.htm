I'm sorry this isn't short or about oil leakes or torsion bars, but 
about the darker side of Porsche ownership. I've got a 1993 RS America 
that I can't drive because the state won't process the title without 
paperwork from the insurance company that sold the car, the insurance 
company won't send the paperwork because (I guess) the car is sold and 
they don't care anymore. 

I know some of you folks buy and sell a lot of cars. I need your 
combined wisdom in a big way. Anyone with ideas or past experience 
please post a message or contact me directly. It's stopped being funny. 

What looked like a complicated title and registration transfer
for this RSA I bought has turned into a nightmare. It was stolen a few 
years (and owners) ago (happens to the best Porsches) and lost the 
original wing, wheels and rear seat storage box (replica poachers, I 
guess). When the insurance company (let's call them "Keystone" for 
reasons that will be obvious later) in Florida resold it, they messed up 
the paperwork and got a "unrebuildable" title (as if wings and wheels 
were major structural damage).  The new owner worked with them for 
nearly a year to correct the error, but all he got back was a 
"rebuildable" title. By Florida law, it should have an "insurance
recovery" title that would revert to a clean title on resale.

This is where I came in (fall, 1995). By that time, "Keystone" had
promised to redo the paperwork, but they made the same errors as
before, so nothing changed. (This has been confirmed with the Florida
DMV.) In weekly calls since about April, 96 "Keystone" says the new
title is "being processed". Florida DMV says they haven't received
anything.  Does it look like maybe "Keystone" is sand bagging? They
appear to be either incompetent or seriously pissed off at the former 
owner who was just trying to sell his car and wanted a proper title.

Now, here's the question. Is there a legal way to work around this
impass with the insurance company? Like finding a friendly DMV in
another state? If I register it with the existing title, the car's value
will drop 50% for no reason. It's in great condition. I had engine and 
body experts check it out very carefully.

Anybody looking for a $39,000 parts car?

Maybe I should stay with my 914
