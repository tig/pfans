Understeer, the eternal 914 performance question. Thak, if you can 
answer this, you are ready to tackle string theory.

Now that my opinions are in proper perspective, and realizing this is
one driver's opinion based on his car only, here are a few tips from a
914 sometimes track driver. It has to be said: technique does a lot to
eliminate understeer. I scrubbed off a lot of tires before I learned 1)
you can't make it go any faster in the hairpins than it want's to go--
more gas means more understeer. 2) with practice (I didn't catch on
until after the Bondurant driving school), you can do a lot with late
(trail) braking to bring the rear around and even jump off the throttle
in the corner entry to REALLY bring the rear around in the 914 (that's
where the practice comes in), it's fast, but catchable in the slow-speed
corners where you should be experiencing understeer. Play the throttle.
The 914 communicates better than (dare I say?) a 911. Just be ready to
jump back in with a lot of gas and some countersteer if you over play
it.

Set up:
On my set up (stock F&R sway bars, 19mm hollow torsion bars, 165-lb
progressive-rate rear springs, koni gas shocks, 195x15 tires on 5.5
rims), I changed back down from 21mm front torsion bars because the
front was too stiff. 

In playing around with front and rear height adjustments, I find that 
the front should not be very much lower than the rear(echoing David 
Ferguson), even though it looks cool. Some 911 drivers on the P-philes 
list even swear the rear should even be higher to induce better turn in. 
This is a free upgrade and all it takes is time to experiment with the 
front torsion bar height adjustment.

Just give me a second to slip into my asbestos suit...
