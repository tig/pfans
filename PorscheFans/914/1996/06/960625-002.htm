Sighted Boxster, chased same.

Actually saw 3 Boxsters at the Factory on Friday. First was a red one at
about lunchtime, coming out of the Werk II gate and headed
for the Autobahn, the usual break-in route. Saw second one as I went past
the Weissach development center toward Heimsheim (huge traffic jam on
freeway through Engelberg Tunnel, so I took back roads past my old house).
Boxster was all black, coming the other way. Third car came blasting out of
a side road just before the autobahn on ramp, fell in behind, I let him pass
and followed him from Heimsheim all the way to Pflorzheim West. This is part
of Porsche's historic endurance test route, part autobahn, part country
roads through the Black Forest in a big loop back to the development center.
I followed him for about 20 miles. We got up to about 125 mph indicated and
he had lots of reserves left, traffic didn't allow any more. The car was 
pale yellow underneath (perhaps a canary metallic yellow like the Nissan 300
ZX color) with lots of black camouflage vinyl stuck on it. Exhaust is
stainless steel. Rear tires (about all I could see from my vantage point)
appear to be at least 225, maybe more like 245 section. I saw this car at
6:30 PM on a Friday, it looked like a mechanic driving, not an exec, so it's
a good bet that this is part of around-the-clock endurance testing.

Postscript: Jim Moder says his local Porsche dealer in Kaiserslautern,
Rittersbacher, has on on display, without camouflage. Wonder how they swung
that...
