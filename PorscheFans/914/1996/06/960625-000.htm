  I find this discussion on cams and fuel injection timely.
  My '73 2.0 8:1 motor has a stiff cam that was installed when
a carburetor setup was brought online.  Having what
I considered wonderful success. (snappy response,
equivalent fuel economy, and that throaty roar. . .)
  But then reality occured and the carbs needed a shut-off
to kill the after-run, and the problem of A/C loading
at idle (no throttle up solenoid), and then rebuild/retune
and debug, and no choke in cold temps, linkage wear,
sticking floats. . .etc, etc.

  So I went back to the original MPC injection system
without a change to the cam.  The results are
close to what have been described here, but not as severe
as you might think.  The car does have some oddities idling
and when cold, (things that seem different from the original car
I remember) but these can be compensated for with the
available controls (air bypass screw and/or mix control on
the brain).  Some of these oddities could be taken as
effects of 'cam incompatibility' but I see them as both wear/
age on the injection system and powerplant, and symptoms of an
aggressive camshaft.  (. .and maybe kyle's memory of things -I did
this 15 years ago and still driving the motor today)

  In a before/after summary, I would say that two things were
different and attributable to the cam:  Lumpy idle, and a
lower air bypass screw setting (less air) to hold down the
idle.  (I wish I knew what brand/grind exactly I have)

  From a tradeoff point of view, I prefer the injection system
and 3/4 race cam setup because it bumps up the motor's output, is
driveable on the streets and requires less maintenance than carbs.
  I recall doing the carb conversion because the injection system
was going afoul and rather than spend on 4 fuel injectors, I spent
on Weber's thinking yeah, with carbs I can adjust my motor to
taste. . .and adjust, and adjust. . .
  Unfortunately, all of this does nothing good for emissions..
