Ken,
  Your cable sounds like a 'heavy duty' version.
  I had one of these too.  Mine didnt last two days
before I ripped it out for analysis. .
  Apparently, the ferrule at the end of the black
segment and start of the white 'tube liner' segment
was crimped improperly and caused the cable to bind.
  This makes for a dandy ride.
  I messed with it enough to pull the ferrule off the black
end. . .then it was kaput.

  I dunno, heavy duty didnt do it for me.
  I went back to stock Porsche cables (keep a spare).
