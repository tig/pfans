RE 914 understeer questions and comments:

Jeff Canaday is correct in saying that "It has to be said: technique does a lot
to
eliminate understeer. I scrubbed off a lot of tires before I learned....."

While I'm not a world-famous driver, and my 914 track skills are a bit rusty, I
have done a fair amount of driver's ed instruction in all types of cars (I used
to be VP/Competition for POC) and more often than not a student or novice
driver will complain about under/oversteer when proper technique is the real
issue. Any car will feel "wrong" if you do not use (or at least understand) the
correct driving technique - for example, my heavily-understeering Suburban can
be made to oversteer by going deep and lifting mid turn, while my
(intentionally) oversteer-biased 911 racecar can be made to understeer by
accelerating too heavily/too soon on corner exit.

Assuming that you have had some driver's ed and track experience with the car
and you are looking to "fine-tune" the handling, you need to consider the
courses you are setting the car up for. In general, you should set the car up
for the exit corners onto the fastest section of and/or longest straight on the
track. Autocrosses are a different story - the car should be much more
"oversteery", the degree depends on driver preference.

I always see more students adjusting cars at the track than experienced
drivers, usually to little avail. If you are new to the car or new to track
events - get the car to a "safe" point and work on your skills first. Ask an
experienced driver (preferably one with a similiar car) to drive your car and
get his input before you make big changes. And ALWAYS make changes one at a
time (to understand the effect of the change) and in small increments - keep
good notes!

Please let me apologize in advance if you know all this and were just seeking
input (I'm new to PorscheFans) - but I thought I'd try to save you a few hours
if possible!

Good luck -
