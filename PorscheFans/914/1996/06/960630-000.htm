Hi,

I bought two brass rollers from Doc & Cy's.

Anybody have any suggestions on how to install the things?
Seems like I'm going to need quite a bit of pressure to push them into place.
Am I going about this wrong?<<

You need to push the torsion bar down that rest against the roller.  These can
be very dangerous, so be careful!  Then once you have the bar pushed down the
roller will slip off the shaft, assuming you have one left.  Next 
slip the new roller on to the shaft.  Allow the bar to rest in the grove on the
roller.

Suggestions, I would take the hinge apart and lube all the joints, especially
the pivot bolt.  This could save you a future hinge pivot mount replacement.
Don't be surpassed if the bolts don't come out or they break the mounts when you
do it.  If you don't go this far pre-lube the roller, so you don't have to try
it in the car.
