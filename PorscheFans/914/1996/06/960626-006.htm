    No.

    The bushings may help with your second/reverse problem,
    especially since the bushing-installation procedure involves
    properly aligning the shift-linkage.  The "balky first gear"
    problem is pretty typical of 901s... If it gets to be real
    annoying, you can solve it by getting into the habit of
    following this procedure whenever you shift into first:

        1.  Depress the clutch pedal.
        2.  Move the shift-lever to fourth or fifth gear.
        3.  With the clutch pedal still depressed, move the lever to 
            first gear.  It should engage smoothly.
        4.  Release the clutch.

    Of course, this doesn't help you much if you're downshifting
    into first on a racetrack, but you shouldn't be doing that with
    a 901 anyway.
