There should be one (double?) brown wire, and a black wire with a 
tracer, I think purple.  The black wire goes to the UNSWITCHED
side of the light (Which you can get at the dealer for $3, the
bulb costs more than the light!)

I have never heard of these lights "catching fire" before.  And
I've seen some pretty ratty 914's where the light still worked.

The light's only bright enough to help you find your flashlight
though.........  (Yes, mine works, and I do find it useful)
