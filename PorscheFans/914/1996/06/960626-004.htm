One of the problems that 914 track cars often run into is that they have
the front end lowered too much, and are actually running out of suspension
travel.  When that happens, the car will want to understeer (and the change
from oversteer to understeer may be somewhat abrupt:-).  If your
car is really low, I would try raising the ride height (try 1/2" and
1" height change).  If this solves the problem, and you still want to run
the front of the car low, you should have your spindles raised on the
struts.  Note: you can raise the spindles about 15mm or so with 15" wheels,
if you go to 16", you can raise it 25mm.

Hope this helps.
