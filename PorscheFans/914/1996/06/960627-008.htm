Greetings P-nuts,
FOR SALE
an '85 944 (early version)
- one owner, older gentleman.
- 160k conservative, highway miles
EXTERIOR DETAILS
- Alpine(?) White, paint (original) and body are in excellent shape, except for:
a. one small dent aft of passenger rear wheel well
b. curious scratch on passenger front wheel well lip(right at apex)
- rear window wiper (for what that's worth)
- ATE cookie cutter wheels
- good tires front/rear
INTERIOR DETAILS
- a/c (needs charging)
- power everything (I think)
- leather interior (black) good original worn condition; no tears, rips,
and nothing missing, except driver's sun visor
- sunroof works
PROBLEM POINTS
- needs steering rack
- has original clutch still in it
- timing belt/water pump are both about 60k miles old.
- Front & rear Brake rotors are pretty well scored;
a. but car still seems to stop ok
GENERAL NOTES
- There is no  service documentation, but car was mostly serviced by J&T
Motors in Hanford, CA
- I drove this car and I think it's worth fixing...
- Owner needs to dissappear this car before 24 July-he's leaving the area.
- I had my P-car shop (European Motors-Vista, CA) "worst-case estimate" the
above problems (except brake rotors) over the phone, and the tab would be
approximately $2600-$2800.
- I was going to buy this car myself and immediately repair the above problems
- Unforeseen financial hassles prevent me from jumping on this car right now.
- Owner is asking $1500 but is taking offers...seriously, he would really
like to unload this car.  The owner is an associate of mine here at China
Lake, but I 've no idea where's he's going, but he's REAL anxious for a
buyer before this 24 July date.

Call Roy Parimore in Ridgecrest CA (619)446-2490

I'm at (619)446-8005; but please don't call me unless you can't get ahold
of Roy at the above number...and I'll drive over to his house or something.

There's gotta be SOMEBODY out there!

Cheers
Thom Kuby
