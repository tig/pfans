So let me get this straight.....

 You were planning on not having to replace the grease seals, and your planning
on reusing the existing bearings????

 COME ON (sri about the screaming) you're working on a Porsche not a domestic sled.
Do you "love" your car? Do you want to be back were you started in the next couple
of months (insert years, days, weeks..ect...ect). Heck, wheel seals, and bearings
are cheap (less than $10 for the bearings last time I did mine)

BTW.. we've found that the $25 we spend on having our local machine shop R&R the
bearings and races and turn the rotors is 'bout the best $$$ we've been able to spend.

I'm lost on this one. You don't need to remove anything but the strut inserts
on the fron of 914's or 911 in order to replace them. I know there are manuals
that say otherwise, but let be tell ya.. it only takes a couple of hours to
replace booth fronts, and less time in the rear.

Guess I'm too late. The lower A-frame is off, correct?

Call R&D for the baseline cost of Koni's. 
BTW.. Here in central PA, we usualy use a simple test. We "bounce" the bumper and
from experience, can see if the "dampeners" aren't functioning properly <realy big grin>:-)
