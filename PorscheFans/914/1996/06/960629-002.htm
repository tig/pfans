Archie,

>>The questions are:  Has anyone on the list done this and if so, what are the
results?<<

Yes it can be done, anything can be done. Call MSDS, Inc. (818 453 8823), Martin
started out along time ago turbo charging a 914 and knows all the ins and outs.
Plus several articles have been featured by European Car on the subject.  There
is, was?, a company in IL. that did some turbo work on a type 4 engine.
Featured in VW & Porsche (now European Car) which had a twin turbo and was
intercooled also featured twin plug which produced 240-325 HP depending on PSI
setting.  It was featured in June 1991 issue of VW & Porsche.  Company that
built the beast was Hahn RaceCraft (708) 859-0320 at least in 1991 that was
their number.

>>What turbo-charger should I use and and any points or suggestions
one could offer.<<

Oh boy what a loaded question, there are so many variables I would not want to
recommend a specific turbo.  Try Turbo city, they sell turbos for just such work
don't have their number handy.

European car also featured an article on a 1.8L turbo that was owned by a person
in the Alpine Mountain Region of PCA, March 1992.

Also there are several books out on the subject, one by HP Books and several
others, check your local library, or book store.

Also you will probably have more success using an aftermarket fuel injection
system to get the air fuel ratio correct. One I like is made by Race tech
Engineering Ph. 403-274-0154, which manufactures a line of fuel injection
computers that can use Boost injectors.  Their EM-1E unit measures manifold
pressure and also features boost limiting.  Also available with a knock sensor
option.  One nice feature is the programmer comes with the unit, so you don't
need access to a laptop.  Not badly priced to boot.  Also Haltech (214) 831-9800
manufactures several fuel injection engine management systems and a supplement
system that can be used in conjunction with the current Bosch D-jectronic
system.

Hope this helps.

PS. Please remember to upgrade suspension and brakes to match or exceed your new
found power.

Stephen Jacobs
