Wow.  I don't think I need to go out and tan this weeked; I'm already scorched! =8^)

Just going by the Haynes manual for the 911 (I have a 914 that I'm adding 911
struts to, among other things; couldn't justify getting the 911 manual set for now).
According to that, the seals are re-usable.  My original post asked if this were
true or not, to which I got no response, so I bought new ones anyway.  Regardless
of P-car or not, why replace the wheel bearing if they are in good shape?  I think
even shops are just as inclined to repack than replace is still serviceable.

BTW, I wouldn't mind having local shops do this work for me, but their hours suck. 
9-5/6 M-F, and my location means I can't easily get there without taking time off;
the cost to me is more than just shop time.  I was just talking to someone last
night about the killing local shops would make if they were open on weekends......

Just FYI on pricing out here in OR:
Wheel seals:	$11 each
Wheel bearings:
  Front inner:	$23
  Front outer:  $18
That's $104 for the front, plus installation.  Dunno about the bearing
replacement, but it's costing me $15/each to have the rotors turned.  Things are a
lot cheaper out where you are.

The 911 struts are detached and out of the car.  The inserts in one of them has
what looks like a small leak.  I originally was going to put the Koni inserts from
my 914 parts car, as recommended by Paragon when I wanted to order new ones
(those struts are also out, but removed by undoing the 3 mounting plate bolts)), but
had no idea how to get the upper mount off.  I've since resolved that. 

=8^) on the shock comment, but my question about shock testing was how to check
when they aren't mounted on the car; I guess I should have made that more clear.
Moot question anyway; looks like one front and one rear need to be replaced, so I
think I'll end up just replacing all of them.

Oh, and I did call the local shop downtown about having them do this when it
looked beyond my capabilities.  Assuming I towed the car there, they wanted $240 to
install the f&r shocks, and $660 for a set of std Koni's.  They have an impeccable
reputation, but that was beyond my budget.  So I persevered, and figured it out
myself.

Nope; it's still on the car and intact.  The street hardness bushings are on the
way, so I have the option of going either way.  But the car is 24 years old, and
original ones are "crunchy"; dried and cracking.  I'm inclined to replace them as
they appear worn out to me.

Mike (just schlep'in along....)
