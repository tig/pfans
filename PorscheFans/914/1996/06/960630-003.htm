Hi Guy Eddon, and other 914er's

If you haven't experienced it already, you will learn that replacing 
the rollers or fixing the hinges for the rear decklid is a wrestling 
match, even on a good day.  The torsion bars are Very strong, and even 
the factory-suggested tools can easily slip and do damage to you or 
your car.

Mike Cooley, our own on-line 914 machinist, has invented a torsion bar 
wrestling tool he calls the RickyDo tool.  It grips the bar in a unique 
way that minimizes risk.  He used it on his car, then gave it to me.  
I was able to move a bar from the relaxed position onto the hinge in 
just a few minutes all by myself - without even removing the decklid.  

This tool should be made available to all 914 owners.  It is just a 
matter of time until you will need it.  Mike is not yet set up to make 
more of these tools, so he has agreed for me to rent this first one 
out.  

Since we want this tool to be shared, the rent and deposit are made to 
encourage you to return it promptly.

Contact me for availability of the tool, and my address.
Send me a check for $125.  I will send the tool by priority mail.  Your 
cost will be $20 for the first week, and $10 per week thereafter.
Upon receiving the tool back from you, I will send a check for the 
remainder after deducting the rent.  The proceeds will go to Mike.

Included with the tool will be instructions on its use, and hints for 
replacing the rollers and hinges.
