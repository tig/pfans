I had a very similiar situation a few years back ('80 911SC, occurred in '85)
where the leasing firm that held the title refused to release the title even
after cashing my check. After 1 year of delay (and facing the prospect of
driving an out-of-registration car, subject to siezure if caught!) and over
$1,500 in legal fees, I finally paid $500 to a registration specialist firm
here in Orange County, CA that I found through a P-friend in the leasing
business (Ron Ramage).

What I learned was that if you can show incontrovertible (uncontested) proof of
ownership, most DMV's will allow the paperwork to be processed by treating the
paperwork holder as hostile (for example, in divorce cases or with mechanic's
liens). In my case an employee of the leasing firm was embezzling (and was
caught) but the leasee could give a damn about me personally. The company that
handled my paperwork is no longer around, but several are listed in the local
phone book under "Registration Processing" or "License Processing". 

I also had an '89 BMW M3 with a "Salvage" title (it was purchased at an auction
with a mechanic's lien) because it was easier/cheaper (lower tax value) for the
auction company to process it this way. (Buyer beware - watch out for this at
those Public Auctions you see advertised around!). I was able to convert this
to a clean title by using a local title registration service and showing all
the paperwork to prove that the vehicle was not damaged, but rather was
improperly registered to begin with.

However, based on my experiences, DO NOT try to do this yourself with the local
DMV offices - besides wasting your time, it may have a negative impact on your
view of the future of the human race in general. Pay the $$$ and get it done
right! 

Good luck,
