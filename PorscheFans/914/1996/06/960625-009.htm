Thought I'd jump in here and add my .02.  I'm a bit of a lurker on this list 
as I have other pcar iron but sometimes get relevant stuff from you dudes.  I 
had a problem with the 912 at the track.  When hot, no start.  Has the hot 
start kit on it.  It had a 'new' rebuilt starter.  I mentioned this to Rich 
Bontempi (Mr.914), of High Performance House and he told me that when they 
rebuilt starters they often didn't replace the solenoids.  I bought a new 
solenoid and voila!  No more hot start problems.  Had the same problem with my 
944.  New rebuilt starter, no hot start.  Same solution.  Haven't followed 
this thread very closely so if you've already trod upon this territory, sorry 
for duplication.  BTW, I'm working on getting Bontempi on line.  He'd be a 
great asset for the list and probably has more 914 parts and knowledge than 
anyone I know.

Jeff has hit on the other major cause to hot/cold starting
problems (as far as cranking is concerned).

  I forgot about this, cuz its been several years since
I lithium'd my solenoid. . .

  Oddly enough, I first caught this problem on an Opel
Kadette station wagon. . .The starter solenoid was dusty dry.
  Lubing it brought it back to life.

 ***   File this one away under hot/cold start problems    ***

  If the Starter wont crank. . .
  Cause #2
  Keep the starter solenoid clean and lubricated with
high and low temperature range grease (I use white lithium).
  If it goes dry its bad, but if the grease turns to wax when its
 -20C, the solenoid will freeze up just the same -with motor
cranking and cranking. . ..  Dont ask how I know. . .
