It's time for me to sell my dear old 914.  Years ago, I bought this
car as a beater, a perfomance commuter, and although I've upgraded some
stuff mechanically, I've neglected the cosmetics.  Now, I'm taking a
break to go sailing for a year :) , and I plan to get a nicer 914/2.0
when I get back.

California car, now in Redwood City, SF Bay area.

'73 body, original paint, light blue.  Was a 1.7 originally.
'74 2.0 engine, swapped in August, 1995.
Hi-volume oil pump.
Rebuilt tranny in February.
  New 1st & 2nd dog teeth.
  New 1-3 synchro rings.
  New 2nd-3rd slider.
  Otherwise inspected and fine.
19mm brake master cyl, stainless brake lines, all new in April.
Center console & guages.
All new rubber around the roof and doors.
Mahles & suburban tires (Michelin XZX).
All lights work; lenses are intact.
Mantainance for last several years by Rich B. at High Performance House.

Rust:
  Passes the "butt test":  doors open & close with top off & people seated.
  Battery area has only minor surface rust:  no real problem.
  Rust spots behind doors near pylons.
  Rust in front of windshield where front quarters join body.
  Front & rear bumpers have rust under the rubber.
  Numerous scratches & chips.  NEEDS paint.
  
Engine:  Generally good.
  Recently, runs rough when cold.  I assume this just needs a tuneup.
  When autocrossing (at Dublin, with PCA GGR), exhaust smokes when throttle
    is lifted quickly after high-rpm run.  Everyone tells me this is a worn
    valve guide.  I never see smoke in normal driving.
  June '96 checkup:
    Compression  1-140  2-135  3-135  4-150
    Leakdown     1-  6% 2- 34% 3- 30% 4-  6%


So, what's this car worth?  $2.5k?  I'm eager to hear any opinions,
and, of course, offers.  No reasonable offer will be refused.
I can be reached by phone at (415) 367-9926.

     Take care,

          Rick

NB:  the thing next most worth doing is autocross!
