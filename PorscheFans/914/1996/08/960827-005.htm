I have to agree with all previous recommendations for the Lincoln 2 ton
service jack. This is the lowest jack (3 1/2"") and highest lifting (20").
Servicable, smooth and reliable. My $90 cheapo goes only 5 3/4" to 19".
Especially if your car has been lowered or you have a 951, this is the best
investment in your tool collection. They are expensive (List $ 399).
A&I tool supply has a sale till November 10 (1-800-260-2647): $289.00 and
free shipping, the best price I've seen in a while. They usually sell for
about $320-340.

Subject: Blazer vs. 914 round 2...

Hi all,

	This is a question to all you body gurus out there. The left rear
quarter panel is as good as gone. It is unsalvageable. How much is involved
in the replacement of that panel? This car is a time trialer/autocrosser
and I'd need the repair to be structurally sound to race-car levels. I know
that there's alot of joints under there, and I'm wondering if my car will
ever be as strong as it was. There is no apparent frame or suspension
damage. The door jam is straight and the paint is undisturbed. But the seam
between the fender and the door is now about an inch wide. The door opens
and closes just fine. Hell, it closes better than ever. And _that_ makes me
worry. In addition, the door skin is crunched, and the outer rocker panel
is torn. The ammount of damage is considerable. 

	This is the only time that I was glad that I didn't have a 6.
Seeing that if I did, there'd be 12 quarts of oil all over the place. The
trailer hitch would have scored a perfect bulls-eye on the oil tank. 

	The insurance company is State Farm, and will inspect the car
tomorow. I'm not driving it now as there was just enough fender clearance
to get get the car home last night and to the shop in the morning.

	I'm still really bummed, and now I won't be able to drive it at the
autox this weekend. Last event of the regular season...

-sigh-

Everything expresed here is the opinion of the idiot that wrote it, 
namely ME. So don't go suing the DOE, they don't care...
