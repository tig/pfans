I have begun recording acceleration rates in my 914 by tying a tape 
recorder to the tach input.  It records a click for every time the 
points open.  I have been using the other channel to make verbal notes.
I have made a number of runs in 2nd gear from 2000 to 6,000rpm.

Now I can take the recorder to our shop and play the tape into a 
recording Tek scope.  From the scope I can run a 488 bus to my PC and 
save the run as a spreadsheet file that prints out a graph.  It's very 
accurate and effective, but just a pain in the butt.

Do any of you software/hardware types know of a way to record from the 
tape or tach directly into a file in my laptop?

With accurate acceleration runs, we can make some real, measurable 
progress.
