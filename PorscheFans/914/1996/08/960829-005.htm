I've had a couple of thoughts running through my head regarding the
performance of our 914's.  The discussion and possible future
improvements of the ECU has put a glimmer of hope into the idea of
having a fast 914 without spending tons of cash.  Tell me what you
think...

First thought:  Having seen substantial evidence indicating that
performance can linked to the temperature of the air comming through the
intake, what are the possible approaches to acquiring this cool air?  I
imagine that if I take off my drain tray, seal the gaps between the body
and the engine tin, and fix the exhaust leak into my engine compartment,
I could start sucking in substantially cooler air.  What about other,
cooler sources?

Second thought:  Is it possible to ever know if your car is running as
good as it could?  I understand that the '76 914 2.0 had 88 hp stock,
and weighed in around 1050 lbs.  Having pulled off the power-robbing
smog pump, replacing the stock pistons with Euro pistons (with Total
Seal rings), replacing the stock heat exchangers and exhaust with a
better-flowing header/Bursch system, and porting (and kind of polishing)
the heads, I would figure that I'm in the 105-110 hp range.  Also,
having given up the weight of the heavy bumpers (aluminum supports the
rubber now... not much of a bumper), the heat exchangers, and all of the
heating equipment (fan, flapper boxes, etc), I figure that I'm closer to
2000 lbs.  This would mean a power-to-weight ratio of somewhere between
18.2 and 19 lbs/hp.  I had an old RX7 that had a power to weight ratio
of about 23 lbs/hp.  Now, I understand that there's a lot more than goes
into 0-60 times than power to weight, but I would figure that the 914
would be capable of beating the RX7.  I have since sold the RX7 to a
friend, and the cars seem just about equal in acceleration.  Granted,
the 914 kills it in handling, but I just think it should have a little
more "oomph".  What are typical 0-60 times for the 914s out there now?
Any other easy mods to get a little faster?


Thanks for the time!
