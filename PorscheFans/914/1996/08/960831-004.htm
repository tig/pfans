Well there are a few things that you can do. One, remove the secondary
throttle return spring. It's the little stand alone coil that just clips
to the throttle cable arm on the t-body. There should be a primary
spring around the valve shaft, leave that one alone. Two, disconnect the
cable from one the throttle body and try it, if it's still stiff, it's
the pedal bushings or pivot. Three, replace the cable, it's a pain in
the butt, but it's easier than trying to lube the old one in situ with
graphite. Don't use grease as it will turn to glue over time with all
the accumulated dirt and dust. But that's just my opinion of course, I
could be wrong...

By the way, I replace my cable _and_ removed the secondary spring. It
feels light and responsive now.

One, other thing, check that the throttle vavle motion is smooth and
isn't sticking. Do that when you disconnect the cable.
