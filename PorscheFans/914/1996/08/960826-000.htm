For those of you who receive multiple lists, sorry for the cross posting but
wanted to get the word out to broadest audience.

Some of you may remember that about 2 years ago I had a 6x15 Fuchs wheel
fail. Granted it was an early 911 wheel and altho it was not damaged, it had
been used for autocross/track with R1s and A008RSs for many years. Most of
know to watch for cracks at the lug nut area. What was different with this
failure was that the cracks were at the outside of the spokes at the rim
edge. 2 spokes were involved, adjacent to one another and were substantial -
both long and thru rear to front. From the propagation, they seem to have
stated on the back and traveled to the front, at least they were longer in
the back than the front. The wheel was used for my track tires for my 914-6
(totally stock save for front sway bar). It was the right rear.

Last year I got some HRE 525s (stock 17 rim widths) to use as track wheels
for my 993 (stock with factory 17's, sport suspension,limited slip, abd, abs,
US ride height). I run R1s. They have had 7 track days, all at Lime ROck and
2 autocrosses. While cleaning them up to go get them weighed for possible
shipment to Parade I found the right rear cracking at 2 adjacent spokes at
the outside of the rim. Again, the crack was longer in the back than the
front and one was all the way thru the metal while the other had not quite
broken thru to the front. I got the wheels thru NTW. Both they and HRE have
done right by me. As the wheels are 3 piece and there is no damage to other
than the center piece, it is being replaced at no charge to me.

The reason for the post is two-fold.
ONE: Is there something peculiar going on or just a coincidence that both
incidents have been a right rear? Lime Rock wears the left side (esp LR) not
the right.

TWO: Both incidents were found when thoroughly cleaning the wheels inside and
out off the car. They were undetectable when dirty. I cannot emphasize enough
the importance of regular thorough cleaning and inspection of components, esp
if you autocross or track your car.

TIA
Judy Hendrickson
