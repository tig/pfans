JJ ...good for you and your buddy getting the old 914 back in operation...to do the carb 
adjustment right you will need to get an air flow meter...can't remember the brand but 
all the Pnut vendors carry this one that is made of plastic and has a rubber cone shaped 
end that goes in the carb venturi....this is not the old butterfly with bubble one that 
was used on the old British cars....this will help you set the air flow equally between 
each carb venturi....this is done with the air correction needle valve....there is a 
Weber book that covers most of their carbs inculding the 40/44 IDFs....it has a 
proceedure for setting up initial and then fine tuning....if I remember correctly set 
the volume mixture needle valve screw to about 1 1/2 to 2 turns open then then the air 
correction needle valve to about 1 turn open and this should get you atleast going....I 
have been able to set up my autox 914 1.8L with Webers to run very well and even pass 
the emission testing with the air flow meter and adjusting the mixture needle screws...
Actually these carbs are forgiving enough that you can get it running...the real problem 
in fine tuning comes when you have an air leak from the carb to head gaskets or the carb 
itself...
Timing of course is critical on the carbed 914...an 009 or 050 Bosch distributor work 
well....need about 27deg total advance....you can find this info in the Clymer or other 
914 books....Good luck!!
