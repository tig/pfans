Why not build an intercooler for the 914? I was thinking of implementing
a setup with thermoelectric cooling devices inside the intake box.
There's only two drawbacks though, there isn't a good enough heat sink
to get rid of the heat generated by the peltier chips, and that as a
result it would only be good for short uses. Like an AUTOCROSS!

You do mean 2050. don't you? Either way, the later 914s weighed in at
more than that. I don't remember how much. But my '74 914 with 1/3 tank
of gas weighs in at approximately 2075.

How far did you port the heads? Porting will make the flow better at
high RPM, but it really won't have much of an effect (if any) for a
street driven 914. Not that it's a bad thing. just that it really
doesn't buy you much for the ammount of mony it cost. And I don't
believe polishing and porting to be the same thing. Did you have both
the intake and exhaust tracks ported?

That's a pretty liberal estimate. I wouldn't go quite that high.
Certainly 100+, but I wouldn't give it 110.

Actually, an early mk.I RX-7 GSL-SE puts out about 140 HP, and weighs in
at about 2500lbs, maybe 2600. This yields approximately 18lbs/hp.
Whereas, the 914 if it's puting out say 105 hp (being very generous
here) would yield about 19lbs/hp. And the RX-7 is capable of far more HP
than that. A friend of mine has an autox monster that puts 170+hp to the
rear wheels. Dyno tested about a month ago. No internal engine mods
either. Electromotive FI, and alot of time and money...

It has the potential. Weight distribution is the best reason. It can get
more of its weight over the drive wheels in a dragstrip launch. The RX-7
has the advantage of having a limited slip available as an option. That
is big plus. Also, the RX-7 can basically wind out forever. The redline
on a stock RX-7 is simply dictaded by how much air it can suck in and
how much exhaust it can push out. The 914 on the other hand can only rev
so far before the cam simply renders the power nonexistant. the RX-7 can
just leave it in 2nd gear for an eternity, whereas the 914 will need to
shift into third _much_ sooner. OUt of the box, the RX-7 has it. With
equal amounts of money invested, the RX-7 still has it. The 914 has the
advantage of handling. The live axle of the RX-7 is a big detriment to
it's handling characteristics. And the RX-7, although a very well
balanced car by itself, still tends to push a bit.

I don't know what my 0-60 times are. Maybe I'll try and get some
measurements done sometime. 
As for getting more "oomph", try getting more air into the engine. Bored
out throttle body, remove the air filter assy, tuned header exhaust
system etc...

Good luck on you 914. I know how it feels to wait for the car... :(

I want enough power that I can light up my tires at the end of the
moulsane! Now that's enough power. Anything less is inadequate...
