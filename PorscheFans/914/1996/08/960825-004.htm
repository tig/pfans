This is only a month after Dave Darling posted his question about 
charging problems (before he lost his heads). I don't know why but 
poking around in the engine's open craw jogged my memory about a similar 
problem I had (how quickly we forget).

In my case, the cause was cracked insulation from the 2.0 warm-up 
regulator lead grounding the full 12V current to the regularor's body.
Replacing the voltage regularor helped, but did not cure it, that's when 
I found the bad wire. Because it was grounding right where it exited the 
body, I had to cut away half of that little tube the wire exits from to 
get to the site of the short. I just doped it up with silicone and 
reinforced it with shrink tubing.  You can also pry open the bead all 
around the canister's top to replace the whole wire from the inside, but 
that is a last resort.

Try disconnecting the warm-up air regulator wiring (and maybe pluging  
the intake hose) to see if this is the cause.

Also, did you inspect and clean that itybity ground below the 
regulator/fuse plate?

How's the car run with the new heads?
