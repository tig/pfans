I have always assumed that the Ljet EFI was not as capable of max power 
as the Djet, and that was why Porsche stuck with Djet for the 2.0.
However, the 912E with the same 2.0 engine has Ljet, which is 
confusing.

The airflow meter, a potentiometer tied to an air valve, seems like it 
would really restrict incoming air, as the airflow must push against a 
spring.  In the interest of science(?) and curiosity, tonight I took an 
airflow meter from a 914 1.8 and plumbed it in place of the aircleaner 
on my '76 914 with Djet.  

WOT, 5800rpm showed one inch manifold vacuum with airflow meter 
installed.
WOT, 5800rpm showed zero vacuum with no aircleaner or meter installed.

I have aircraft engine charts that show only 3% loss of power for one 
inch reduction of manifold pressure.  My butt said about the same 
thing, but not clearly.

My experience with Ljet is more limited than with Djet, although it is 
on my '81 Vangon.  It just never gives any trouble.  One advantage of 
Ljet is the unlimited variety of distributors you could install.

Ljet probably also has more potential for use with a turbo, which is on 
my list of someday mods for the '76.  I have most of the Ljet off of a 
912E, so the changeover would be pretty easy.  The intake runners are 
identical, and the intake box just has one less vacuum port.  To 
convert, I would only have to change the injectors and FP regulator, 
the harness, the ECU, and the aircleaner and airflow meter.

What are your thoughts on this?

Yes, I know, I haven't completely wrung out the Djet yet, but I will.
