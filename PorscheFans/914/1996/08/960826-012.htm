Well, the wording of the requirement is "Special attention to non factory
wheels." What we really are looking for, without any undue risk of lawsuits
by wheel manufacturers, are the TUV approval, or JIL approval (in the case
of Japanese wheels). BBS and factory wheels seem to be holding up OK, but even
the Fuchs wheels are developing cracks, so we're spending a little extra time
inspecting those wheels.

Strangely enough, at the PCA Club race in Mosport, one of the 944 Turbo drivers
managed to put some cracks in two of his 5-spoke 968 lookalike wheels. 
Had he put another crack in one of the three remaining spokes, he might
have broken the wheel through. (He was also an attendee at the Zone 1 48
Hours, his wheels were fine at that point...)

I am, and use factory wheels exclusively, and keep a skeptical eye on those...

Good Luck!
