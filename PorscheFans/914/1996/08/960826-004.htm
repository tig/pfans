After sitting for three years, my friend finally decided to get his 914
running once again.  The carbs had rusted shut, so he bought a used set
of 40mm Webers (they had been 44mm Delartos) that had come off of
another 914 2.0.  The battery was dead, so he bought a new one.  We
changed the oil, and replaced the fuel lines.  After convincing
ourselves that it *probably* wouldn't catch fire (it did once before, so
we had an extinguisher real close), we tried to start it.  No luck.
Then we noticed that the fuel pressure was set to "0".  We turned it up
to 4 (I'm assuming it's metered in psi), and tried again.  Still no
luck.  Then we pulled a spark plug, only to discover that it was
completely black.  After replacing all four plugs, we tried once more,
and this time it started.  The old Monza 4-tip exhaust had completely
rusted off, so it was just the heat exchangers muffling the exhaust, and
they didn't do a very good job.  This has to be the loudest (and meanest
sounding) 914 I've ever heard.  After letting it warm up for about 2
minutes, the car actually idled quite smooth.  We were very excited
about these results, and decided that perhaps we should give it a spin
around the parking lot.  Unfortunately, as soon as you let up on the
clutch, the car stumbles and dies.  It will free-rev just fine, but it
appears that the engine it developing about 5hp tops.  It smokes a bit
out of the driver's side heat exchanger and up through the oil-filler
tube, so we're assuming that he's got some really bad rings in there and
a rebuild is next on the list of things to do.  Regardless, we'd like to
see if we couldn't get the car to move a little before we tear it apart.
 I have no experience with carbs at all, so I don't even know where to
begin.  I know that he bought the carbs from a guy in Maryland, and
we're in Colorado, so there's probably a good 5000ft difference in
elevation.  Can elevation compensation/adjustments be made by a
knowledge-deficient person such as myself, or do we need to get the car
into a shop?

Any help would be greatly appreciated!
