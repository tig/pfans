>Hi

>>What's confusing me is whether the injectors fire twice per 180 
Degrees of>>rotation or whether they only fire once per revolution. 
Does anyone know>>about this?

>The injectors fire twice per distributor revolution. Two injectors 
>fire at>the same time. So #1 and #4 injectors will fire, #1 inlet will 
>be open, the>fuel will hang around #4 inlet for a while. Then the 
>other set of contacts>in the distributor opens, #2 and #3 injectors 
>fire, #2 fuel hangs around for>a while. Simple, really.


>>If they fire only once, then the fuel for one of the cylinders would 
sit>>there until the intake valve opened for longer than the other 
cylinder.

>Yes.

>>For example, in the chart above, when injectors 1 and 2 fire, intake 
1>>opens immediately, while intake 2 won't open for anoter 180 degrees 
of>>crank rotation. I can see that theoretically this could cause a 
>>problem>>in that the fuel fro #2 will partially evaoporate, possibly 
>>causing>>problems with detonation. If it were possible to have the 
>>injectors>>fired individually, then this theoretical problem could be 
>>avoided.

>Yes, sequential multi-port injection is better. It would have cost 
>Bosch>twice the number of output transistors, which I would assume 
>were pretty>expensive back then (remember silicon was new, small 
>signals were OK, but>power transistors were probably at the same point 
>as where 10 GHz stuff is now)
