(Notice: If you don't want to read about the updates with my car's
condition, please skip to the bottom...)

Well, I took the car into the shop, and when they pulled off the header,
another insert broke.  This meant that there was just one insert in the
head, and three gaping wounds.  I paced around the shop trying to figure
out what I could sell to pay for the repairs, and when I came back, they
had patched everything up!  So, I've still got inserts, but I think it's
fixed (for a while).  It turned out that the bolts we had been using
were WAY too short, and were only grabbing about 3 of the threads.  We
put the same size bolts that are used on the halfshafts in, and now
everything seems really secure.  I started the car, and it still
backfired though.  So, we got the car in the air, and I let it idle
while one mechanic plugged the exhaust, and the other looked for
leaks... none found.  So, we dropped it down and inspected the engine
compartment.  We found that one of the four air injectors (smog pump
pumps air into a single, one-way valve, which travels to four injectors,
which inject air into the exhaust for emissions control) had broken off
in the head.  This literally means that I have an exhaust leak right
into the engine compartment.  We tried to plug it up, but it just
wouldn't work.  So...

(stop skipping here if you've skipped)
If anyone has an extra air injector (or the whole valve/rails/injector
setup) that they want to part with, please let me know!

Thanks for your help!
