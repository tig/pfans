It felt to me like the throttle moved easier with the tension spring 
attached.  But of course that depends on the strength of the spring.
I went to the local hardware store and got a couple, and settled on a 
light one.  After the first time you push the throttle open, the windup 
spring is not used, until the tension spring fails.  But of course, 
some 2.0 do not have the windup spring at all.

A worn throttle valve will tend to stick closed, and will not want to 
go back closed, but you have to test it with the spring installed so it 
puts side tension on the shaft.

Check out Mike Cooley's Southern Knight Machining ad on Tim's 914 FAN 
web page.  He will fix it good, for good.
