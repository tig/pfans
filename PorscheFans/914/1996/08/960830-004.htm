Greetings fourteeners,

Re: '74 2.0L

A while back I had posed the question of placing a Mityvac type gauge
somewhere on the engine so that I may time it according to vacumn...I never
did really get a clear answer on this.

- Can I put this gauge on the pressure sensor line?
- will that give me an accurate reading?
- again, WHERE is the optimum "spot" to plug a Mityvac?

I am getting like, REAL CLOSE to having this guy running properly...I know,
it seems like this has been going on for quite some time and that's
true...reason for that is, I write proposals for a living (sort of) and
when I have one of those things on my desk, the rest of the world can go
fish...

But now I have time to resolve this issue...another problem I've been
running into is that there is some  sort of heat-related bug here;  When
the engine is cold, it seems to run just fine only to have it warm up and
start running crappy...Ralph Ricks suggested that I unplug both the
cold-start valve(which I did) as well as the sensor located right near my
distributor (can't recall which one that is right now - did that too).  In
the morning (saturday) I will attack this in ernest...

However, is there anyone with a good idea for Mityvac placement so I can
get the timing right? ( I think I have a replacement fan on engine...so I
don't trust the timing marks on it. Everytime I use the light, the way I'm
supposed to, I get strange results)

Any thoughts?

Cheers
