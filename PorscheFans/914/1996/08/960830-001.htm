Thanks for all the replys on the connectors.  After careful =
reexamination, I can see where some had tabs at some point in the past, =
but the 4 in the pressure sensor plug don't look like they ever had =
anything.
One more question (for now): my '76 former CA car has the electronic rev =
limiter.  Anybody know if this needs to be in the system for the F.I. to =
work right?  Will removing it screw anything up?
As far as added performance goes, the ignition system could stand =
improvement.  The Perlux Ignitor made my engine run much smoother, so =
probably added some power.  A recent European Car article on a 924 =
showed an improvement in gas milage with a Jacobs ignition.  I've got =
one I'm going to try when I get the car back together.  Also there are 1 =
or 2 companies out there making aftermarket knock-sensing ignitions, =
which will keep the timing as advanced as possible, should be good for a =
few horses.
Has anyone tried one of the hydraulic lifter/cam setups?
