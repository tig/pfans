Reading Dave's tearful saga reminds me of my own, and makes me wonder if
everyone who owns (and works on their own) 914 has their own tearful
saga.  I would assume so.  While we're on the subject of tearful sagas,
I thought I'd share a small piece of mine and see if you guys have any
advice:

After removing and rebuilding the top-end of my '76 2.0 liter, I decided
that I'd put the headers and Bursch exhaust back on the car.  When I
bought it, that's what it was equipped with, but due to the fact that it
was February in Colorado, I had a mechanic put the heat exchangers and
Monza exhaust on.  Once I got the car running (I forgot to disconnect
the Manifold Pressure Sensor when dropping the engine, and snapped all
four un-marked, all white wires), I noticed that it backfired terribly.
After taking it to a shop and hooking it up to an emissions machine, we
set the timing perfectly, and had it passing emissions with flying
colors.  Since I knew that my timing was correct and that my fuel
mixture was as close to perfect as I was going to get it, I decided it
had to be an exhaust leak.  When I had put the headers on, for some
reason I decided that the old copper gaskets didn't need to come out.
So, that's where I began... pull the exhaust, replace the gaskets, and
put it back together again.  After pulling the exhaust, it was
discovered that four of the eight holes in the heads were inserts (and
destroyed), and the other four were just destroyed.  So, the inserts
came out, the holes we drilled and threaded, and inserts inside of
inserts were put back in (with lots of loctite).  The other four holes
got the same treatment, but they were just inserts now, not inserts in
inserts.  So, the exhaust was bolted back on, and the car was fired up.
It was much quieter, and didn't backfire any more... until two days
later.  I started the car in the morning and it was unbelievably loud.
I killed the engine, and heard metal banging below as it stopped
shaking.  Inspection revealed that one of the four header pipes was no
longer connected to the car.  One of the bolts had broken off in the
head, and the other one simply broke the insert and fell out.  So, I
pulled that side of the exhaust in an attempt to get the broken bolt
out, and in the process discovered that yet another insert (this time,
an insert in an insert) had broken.  So, currently the passenger-side
header is bolted to the head with one bolt, and I'm going to attempt to
limp to the shop this evening.  I have a bad, bad feeling that I'm going
to have to pull the engine, remove the heads, dismantle the heads, and
send them off to a shop to be welded up and re-drilled.  Neet, huh?

(We should all just write a book... "The Tearful Saga and Other Tales of
Terror")
