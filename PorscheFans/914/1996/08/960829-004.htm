I guess I'll have to take back one or two of the nasty things
I've said about insurance companies (or State Farm).

Comment to all:  Check the "recovery value" for your 914; AAA
puts it at about $1,000 for a 914.

AAA also pounds the value down by trying to compare your car to
cars like Dave's 1.8 (and over the phone, no less).

Recovery Value is the amount of damage the car can get before it's
"totaled".  Has to do with How Much to Fix vs Replace and
Auction off carcas.
