That's all I can thing of.

Yes, CHT moves the whole chart, as does air temp.  If you want more 
fuel at all rpm, you can just disconnect the air temp sensor.

I have been unable to run credible tests, because my vacuum pump is a 
MityVac plastic affair with a gauge of unknown quality.  In fact it 
reads 1" less vac at 15" than the war surplus Manifold Pressure gauge 
I have laying around.

Yesterday I made great strides to cure that dilemma.  At the Pomona 
swapmeet I found an almost-antique Allen distributor machine.  What 
really sold me on it was the vac pump and gauge that are built in.
The vacuum gauge is almost identical to a non-sensitive altimeter, as 
sold on light airplanes in the late forties.  It is a very nice unit.

The machine is from the late forties or early fifties, I would guess.  
At any rate, it is pre-zipcode, which started in the late fiftes, as I 
remember.  Last night I played with it enough to check the vac gauge 
against my MityVac, and sure enough, the MityVac reads 1" low at 15".

Watch for it folks:  Ricks Garage will soon be open for 
                     Dicking with Distributors.

In my efforts to further the science of study of Djet, I modified my 
'76 914 2.0.  I drilled a 1 1/4" hole through the firewall, modified 
the wiring harness slightly, and mounted the ECU and MP sensor between 
the seats.  I had wanted to mount the ECU below the pass. seat, but it 
won't fit.  Now I gotta build a ventilated box to raise the center 
armrest and hide the units, and then repeat the whole thing in my '73.  

The reason for doing all this is to be able to make adjustments on the 
fly, and to use the EFI tester on the road without having to remove the 
decklid and having the cable run in the side window.  And I did this on 
a stock 2.0 whose EFI has been totally reliable and apparently well 
matched.  I have never even hooked up my tester to this car.
