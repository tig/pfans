You can unplug it with no effect, except for lack of engine protection.
I drove mine a long time with it disconnected, then I read Jacobs book.
Wheel hop at WOT, high rpm can hurt an engine .

As for car articles, I doubt that many are unbiased.  You will usually 
see a full page ad for the product just a couple of pages past the end 
of the article.  Many of those articles are actually written by the 
advertiser..

In Jacobs book, he says that automatic knock sensors retard by about 
six degrees, and by the time they recover, your short power burst is 
history.  They are fine for long grades, if working perfectly.  Jacobs 
says a better device is driver controlled timing on the dash, which he 
just happens to sell.

>Has anyone tried one of the hydraulic lifter/cam setups?

I have a Weber setup in my '76 2.0, and like it just fine.  I don't 
know the grind, but feel it could use a little more at the top end.
A late friend put a little hotter Weber hyd setup in his '74 1.8 and 
could not get it to idle, so removed it and eventually threw it away...
