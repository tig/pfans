I'm sorry this took a whole week to post. I had to go make a living for a
week to pay for my racing habit. I look forward to Ted Smith's color
commentary on his win, his venture into PIR's dreaded chicane kitty litter
trap and his bounce off the turn nine wall.

Before the results here is a little side story that is so typical of the
kind of people that make up club racing:

Saturday practice; one of the most enthusiastic racers in the country, Steve
Valentinetti, experiences a mysterious mechanical failure in his new  GT2
993. It just dies. He spends the whole day diagnosing the problem. Finally,
the problem is identified as the fuel pump. It rins but won't pump. But
Steve has no spare and none can be found. 

Enter Jeff Gamroth. Another of the countries most enthusiastic racers and a
competitor of Steve's. Jeff, a mechanic at Marque Motors, calls one of his
customers that owns a 993 and convinces her to allow a transplant of her
fuel pump into Steve's race car. Not only that but Jeff performs the
operation personally. Saturday night he removes the customer's pump and 7:30
AM Sunday he is under Steve's 993 installing same.

Steve qualifies Sunday AM one tenth of a second behind Jeff. 

Ultimately Jeff defeated Steve in the afternoon race but not before they
swapped the lead several times to the absolute delight of the spectators.
Now that's club racing.

MAJOR PS

Be advised stock racers, for the first time in a PCA Club race all cars were
weighed immediately after qualifying and underweight cars were moved back in
the race starting order!!!!

Thanks it for now. Well Ted how about the rest of the story...........?
