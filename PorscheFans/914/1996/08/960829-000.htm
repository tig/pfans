There is a little flat barb on the back side of each contact socket.
It latches into the plastic connector housing.

If they are falling out, the connectors may have been exposed to a 
chemical that has swollen the plastic.  Or maybe they had been removed 
before, and the barbs got flattened.  They should be at maybe a 15 
degree angle.  

Nobody has asked, but may as well mention it here:   to remove a 
contact, grasp the wire near the socket and then push something about 
the diameter of a paper clip into the little rectangular slot on the 
front side of the housing.  That will release the barb, and you can 
gently remove the wire.  It takes a little experience and practice.

The local VW dealer used to carry the sockets at about $1 each, but I 
don't know if they still do, and don't have a part number.
