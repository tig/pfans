        Hi, all!  I'd like some feedback on this.  It's the first of what
may become many parts of what Mr. Watts called my "Long and Tearful Saga".
It details some of the trials and tribulations of my 2.0L project, and is
intended to be entertaining rather than informative.  (Or maybe just
informative on how big an idiot I am...  ;^)

        The Long and Tearful Saga:

        I bought a 914.  That's right, a second 914.  But ya see, this one
is a TWO-LITER!  Everybody knows those are more reliable than the one-
point-eights, right?  Not to mention more fun.
        Over the course of a year of driving and tinkering with my new
"toy", I manage to strip the Head Temp Sensor hole.  I'm told that it is
sort of possible to fix with the engine in the car--if you're a double-
jointed masochist with needle-like fingers.  I have also noticed that my
rubber motor mounts are broken, and that the part of the engine shelf that
the fuel pump is supposed to mount to is only half-there.  Which means the
pump is not really connected to the car's body.  Hmmm....
        I decide that the easiest way to deal with all three of these
things is to remove the engine.  Thus begins the Epic Saga.

        With lots of friendly advice from the Porschephiles and others, I
put my "Baby" waaay up in the air and start disconnecting everything in
sight.  The 914 may have an engine that's particularly easy to remove, but
that still doesn't exactly make the job a simple one.  In fact, I get the
engine lowered about half-way out before I notice that I haven't discon-
nected the positive battery connection!  =8^O   And then I start hearing
nasty noises from underneath shortly after that.  I had also forgotten to
disconnect the heater control cables.  Happily, nothing was damaged.
        Josh Hadler was nice enough to loan me his custom-made 914 engine
support (a few chunks of wood nailed together), so I only needed the one
jack.  Or so I thought.  Once I have the engine completely lowered out of
the car, I find that the car *still* isn't off the ground far enough to
clear the motor.  And that's with everrything off the top--the throttle
body, the air cleaner, the oil filler, the dipstick--everything!  Oops.
I borrow a jack from a neighbor, and use it to get the car about two
inches higher, which is just one stop away from the absolute top of range
for my jackstands.  It's enough--the motor, tranny, and jack roll out.
Although it takes about a half hour to figure out how to keep the left-
side driveshaft from getting hung up on the starter.  (No, I never
claimed to be smart.  And if I did, I was lying.)
        I had already figured out that I wanted to put the engine up on
some cinderblocks at the front of the carport.  (Oh, did I mention that
I was doing all this outdoors?  With no electrical sockets nearby?)  The
next problem was moving the engine around to that point.  I didn't have
the jack quite centered under the engine, which could have produced some
very loud and very expensive noises when the engine fell off it.  So,
more help was procured from my neighbors--this time, just someone leaning
on the one end of the engine was good enough.
        After that was squared away, I decided to drain the fuel tank.
After all, I had these two hoses that wound up at the bottom of the fuel
tank, just put one in a fuel can, and let gravity do the rest.  Of course,
gravity can take a while, so I went back to pulling sheet-metal and
"stuff" off the engine.  Maybe for a little bit too long--I looked up a
while later to find a big puddle under the car.  Oops!  Quickly, dump
the "new" gas into the Honda--well, most of it, but now the Honda's full!
OK, the rest goes in the 1.8.  Now back to re-fill the can.  Let me
assure you that I watched a lot more carefully, that second time.  And
prayed that the gas would evaporate before anyone decided to take a
cigarette break nearby...
        The next thing was to get the rusty engine shelf checked out.
I was able to call on some help from some of the nicest (and fastest!)
autocrossers I know, the Neidel clan.  They have a 914 race car that gets
trailered to events--so I ask if I could borrow the trailer and tow
vehicle to get my car to someone who knows 914 rust problems.  With their
gracious help, we tow the car over to the bodyman's house, where he takes
one look and says, "What rust?  Look, this is a 914.  On a 914, that
isn't rust.  Here, let me show you some photos..."  After ten or fifteen
minutes of looking at repair-in-progress photos of a truly cancerous 914
(looked kinda like Tim Jones' or Paul Holdredge's!) I was prepared to
believe that my 914 didn't have real rust.  So back the car goes to my
apartment--out back, where the landlord won't see it...  I hope.
