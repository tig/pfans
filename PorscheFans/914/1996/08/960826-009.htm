        Well, after WAY too long, I have re-installed the heads
on the 2.0L motor.  I think I need to get "23 ft-lbs" tattooed
backwards on my forehead, though.  This is the second time in a
row that I've started torqueing the head nuts to 30+, then had a
second/third/tenth look at the manual...
        I shredded the oil pump gasket nicely while trying to
re-install the pump, though.  New ones (3--I probably will screw
it up once or twice more!) are on the way.
        So, progress is happening slowly, but is now happening.
I had been a bit too busy or unmotivated to actually *do* any-
thing up until yesterday, even though I had gotten the heads back
on Wednesday.  Mmmm...   Motivation, what a concept!

You Might Be A Racer If, reason #15:  "You sit in your race car
in a dark garage and shift and practice your heel and toe, while
waiting for your motor to get back from the machine shop."
