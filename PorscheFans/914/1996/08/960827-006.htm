Having such a low car can be scary -- the roof of my 914 barely comes up =
to the bottom of the door handle on my boss's Ford Explorer.

You have my greatest sympathies on your tragedy. My 914, when the =
previous owner still had it, was once backed into by a large station =
wagon with a trailer hitch -- ouch! If it had not been for the trailer =
hitch, the bumper pads on the front would have taken the impact. =
Instead, the hitch hit the center of the 914's bumper, curling the pads =
in before the wagon's bumper pushed them in further.

You must remember one of the main rules about parking your 914 is that =
you must not park near anything taller than it -- otherwise, they won't =
see you.  Of course, this means you can only park next to a Lotus =
Esprit, an MG (if its top is down), or an Acura NSX...=20
