Hi all,

Anybody got a frient in Japan that wants a '75 2.0 in very, very sweet 
condition? Mine's got to go to make room for a new baby ('93 RS 
America). It cost's $200 a month for parking here, yes, really.

This is in response to Andy Lester's question about the pins in 914 
harness connections. If you are talking about the little female mini 
spade lugs about 1/8 inch wide. The factory versions have a little tab 
in the back that should be raised up a tad to catch on the connector 
block when inserted all the way. These get bent down when you remove the 
lugs from the connector block. Just pop them back out with a swiss army 
knife blade, SO's cutlery may work as well :-). I have found after 
market lugs have the tab positioned too far forward to seat properly and 
the lugs push back out. Be very careful. I have found the wires to be 
very brittle and/or corroded and easy to break right at the crimped 
joint.

Anyone know a source of these little jobbies with the tab in the stock 
position?

I can't remember if I ever had to monkey with the male pins, as those 
are usually in the component (sensor, injector, etc.).

I've got my engine in many pieces (the rest of the car too, for that =
matter), and trying to figure out what to do with the wiring harnesses.

On every connector, the pins/sockets are falling out of the plastic =
connector bodies.  There is nothing I can see that would hold them in, =
is there supposed to be?  The boots might help, but they've long since =
rotted away.  Any suggestions?
