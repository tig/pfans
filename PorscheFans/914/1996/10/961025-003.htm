You accidentally misstated -- it is all cars *after* '74. =20

My latest Cruise Card statement came with a pamphlet describing the new =
emissions program, but it did not  provide any information on non-stock =
engine vehicles. =20

Officially, all cars 1975 and newer must be tested. When cars 1975 and =
later become 25 years or older (starting in 2000) they are elligible for =
an antique/collector car waiver. The tests are every other year based on =
the even/odd system on your model year.=20

As with most of these programs, there is a limit to what you will be =
required to spend each test period to attempt compliance before you are =
given a waiver.

So, your friend with a '75 may have to deal with it in 1997 and 1999 =
before the car becomes exempt again. At absolute worst, his choice may =
be between spending the max $ per year in tune-ups and getting the =
waiver or simply garaging it until January 1, 2000. (That would be three =
looooooooooooong years!)
