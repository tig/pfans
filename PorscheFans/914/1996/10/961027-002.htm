I just got done replacing stock springs with 140 lb's.  To remove the stock
spring a compressor is a good idea.  A cheap one that consists of a set of
bolts with fingers on each end is sufficient.  On my car the stock springs
were about twice as long compressed as uncompressed.  (I will note they were
riding REAL low!)  The Weltmeister 140 lb.ers I used were short enough that
I bolted them back on the shocks without using a compressor.
