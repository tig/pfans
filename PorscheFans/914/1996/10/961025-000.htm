For Rick Eberle and other interested parties:

  Let's see...  it seems that I just went through this; let me see what =
I  
can remember about it.  First, there's a pretty good write up on one of =

the 914 web pages about the rear brakes; I'd suggest that you read it 
and see if it gives you any ideas.
  Second, I ended up dismounting my calipers and working on them on 
the bench; if your venting clearance screws are frozen, it will be 
impossible to properly adjust the calipers for proper venting clearance =
/ 
handbrake operation anyway, and a re-build is probably in order.
  So... assuming that you dismount your calipers, here's what I did to =

free my adjustment screws.  First, you will have to purchase a good set =

of 3/8" drive metric allen wrenches, as I did.  These are necessary to =

drive the adjustment screws, especially the inside one when the caliper =

is re-mounted on the trailing arm, and also necessary for the 
free-up-the-screw trick. 
   As I recall, my adjustment screws were not frozen, but the notorious =

cap over the inner one was.  My solution was to install the 4mm allen 
on the end of a suitable extension, and deliver several sharp blows to =

the end of the extension with a soft hammer.  The cap came right off 
with no protest.  A similar treatment will probably be sucessful for your=
 
frozen outer adjuster.  The inner adjuster is pretty well protected behin=
d 
a cap, as I mentioned, and hopefully will not be frozen.  If it is, you =
will 
have real problems.
  Please note that the outer adjustment screw is, as I recall, devided =

into two right-hand threaded portions, a short outer one, and a long 
inner one, seperated by a shoulder on the screw which rides on the 
inside of the caliper.  Just outboard of this shoulder a groove is 
machined for a very tiny O-ring.  This seals the brake fluid inside the =

caliper.  The outer threaded portion has a groove machined right into 
the middle of the threaded portion to accept a circlip which holds the =

adjuster in place when it is turned clockwise (direction to retract the =

piston).  This circlip is visible right next to the caliper body as soon =
as 
the outer plastic dust cap is removed. 
  Please be sure to remove this circlip when attempting to break the 
screw free; other wise you will mangle the circlip (as I did).
  Once you get it loose, turn it counter clockwise until the piston falls=
 
out of the caliper.  Actually, the piston won't fall out; it will be nece=
ssary 
to unscrew the piston the last little bit from the adjustment screw by =

turning it in it's bore until you can remove it.  Now, you can turn the =

adjustment screw clockwise, and it will screw into the caliper body and =

fall out the cylinder bore in the caliper.
  I cleaned up my piston with fine emory paper to get the worst of the =

corrosion rough spot off, and finished the job with jeweler's rouge and =
a 
cloth buffing wheel on my bench grinder.  The pistons came out 
looking quite nice, and my calipers don't leak a drop.  
  Replace the piston seal, the tiny O-ring on the adjuster, and 
reassemble the outer half of the caliper, taking care to lubricate with =

brake fluid as you go.  Don't forget to re-install the circlip.
  The inner half adjuster I did not take apart, because it seemed that =

the only way to do so was to remove the handbrake return spring, and I =

just didn't feel like fighting with it.  It is possible to remove the out=
er part 
of the adjuster quite easily once the dust plug is off, as it is simply =
a 4 
mm allen screw with pinion gear teeth where the threads out to be, and =

as such, falls right out of the caliper if you are not careful. 
  NOTE:  because this screw is off center from the actual adjusting 
screw in the center of the caliper bore, and drives the adjuster through =

small gear teeth, it's rotation is BACKWARDS compared to the outer 
screw.  In other words, to get the piston out of the bore, turn the insid=
e 
adjuster CLOCKWISE; to retract the piston into the caliper, turn the 
adjuster COUNTER-clockwise.
  As with the outer piston, you will probably have to rotate the piston =

itself (counterclockwise looking into the caliper bore) to finish detachi=
ng 
it from it's adjuster.
  Clean up the piston, install a new seal, lubricate, and re-install it =
in the 
caliper.  Once it contacts the adjuster, turn the adjuster screw counter =

clockwise to retract the piston into the bore.  I lubricated my inner 
adjusters with silicone grease to protect any exposed rubber inside; I =

don't know if this type grease is necessary, or if any old grease will =
do, 
but I wouldn't put it together dry.
  Don't forget to install the dust boots around the pistons;  I had to =
crop 
the dust boot retaining rings that came with my rebuild kit as they were =

too long and the ends tried to overlap when installed.
  Re-assemble the caliper with new O-rings (they go in the machined 
recesses around the passages between the caliper halves), and 
re-install the caliper.  Adjust as per the haynes manual.  Bleed the 
system (when you figure out how to do that sucessfully, let me know; I =

am still hung up on that step) and you are all set.
  By the way, I grew up fixing Triumphs and MG's; what I and the British =

call a circlip, you American chaps call a C-ring; I don't have the 
slightest idea what the Germans call it.

				Good Luck,
				Jim T.
