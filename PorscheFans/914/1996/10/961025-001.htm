My expierence in CA has been that any car with dual carbs not factory
equipped will fail visual.  They check for a vacuum advance distributor,
all the proper emission lines and a proper airbox.  A friend of mine
found a blind smog tech:)  that ignores the dual Webber 48IDFs.  My
friends car barely fails the idling and the 3,000 rpm tests.  He found
out that if he slips the clutch just a little, to bring the engine under
some load, the emissions are reduced by almost a third.  Does anyone know
why this is?  If you can't get the car smogged, find a relative or friend
in a smog testing free state and just register the car there or you can
go for the totally illegal smog that will cost from $30 - $100.  The
only downside to the illegal smogs is that if the place gets caught,
they may require you to visit a state referee, and those guys don't let
anything slide.  Becareful that once you smog the car the first time and
it fails, CA at least requires to know the reason that it failed and on
the next testing, you must state what steps were taken to bring the
vehicle into compliance.  Hope this helps, 

Rob
