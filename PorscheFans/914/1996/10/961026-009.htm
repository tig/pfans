Stock front torsion bars, or larger?

Yes, it comes out as a unit, but assembly of the new hardware might
require a compressor if you're not doing it yourself. Some springs might
be shorter than other, some requiring compression others not. I have
adjustable perches with 150# and the springs are completely relaxed with
about 6 inches of gap when the car is off the ground.

If you are going to use a compressor, BE CAREFUL! There can be alot of
stored energy in a compressed 140# spring. They have been known to punch
holes in walls if they get away. Don't give it a chance to punch a hole
in you.

The opinions here are those of the idiot that wrote it. Namely ME, so
don't go suing the DOE, they don't care...
