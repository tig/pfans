For Josh Hadler and other interested parties:

  For trouble-shooting the starter and it's associated wiring, I once 
waxed verbose on Tim's 914 Fan web page, and put down more than I 
know.  Because I am a two-finger typist, and because I have to fight a 
knock-down, drag-out with my editor to get it to include other files, I will 
recommend that you take a gander at Tim's 914 Forum, Technical Tips 
and Troubleshooting, Article 31 (I'm screwed - nightmare starter 
problems) sub-article 2 (Starter Problems) by me.  This should give you 
most of what you need.

  The rest of it follows:

  I think it's Thevinen's theorem that states that any real-world voltage 
source can be thought of as a black box containing an ideal voltage 
source (zero internal resistance) in series with a resistance.  Therefore, 
it is this internal resistance that determines the maximum possible 
(short-circuit) current that can be drawn from any source (including an 
automobile battery).
  If the starter motor is sluggish, there are two probable causes:  one is 
that the motor is bad, and the other is that it is starved for operating 
voltage.  The first of these can cause the second in some cases; if the 
motor is shorted internally, then it will draw so much current that even a 
good battery and good wiring will furnish all the necessary voltage drop 
(the algebraic sum of all voltages in a series circuit must be zero) to 
make the voltage at the motor low to none.

  If, however, the motor is good, and the voltage across it is still low, 
then the drop must be ocurring elsewhere.  There are two candidates:  
the internal resistance of the battery (battery discharged or defective) 
and the external resistance of the starter circuit, which includes the 
wire from the battery to the starter, the starter solenoid, and the engine 
to frame grounding.
  From your description, the battery itself may have been damaged by 
the incidental short in the headlight wiring.  Each time a 12 
volt lead-acid  battery is discharged below 10 volts or so, the battery is 
said to have undergone "deep discharge".  For each such discharge,  
it loses approximately 1/2 of it's capacity.  Working at SLAC, I'm sure 
that you're aquainted with the concept of half-life, and it doesn't take 
very many deep discharges before even a new battery is ruined.
  The specific gravity of a good automotive lead-acid cell is about 
1.280.  Much below this and the internal resistance of the battery is too 
high to deliver starting current.  You might begin by checking your 
specific gravity, and then measure the battery voltage while cranking.  
If this is below 9 or 10 volts, or the specific gravity will not come up with 
charging, or both, then it's new battery time.  
  Beware, however; if a drain still exists elsewhere in the system, the 
new battery will be ruined in short order.  Until you find and fix this 
problem, I would recommend that you disconnect the battery upon 
ariving at any destination where you plan to spend more than an hour 
or so.  This is a nuisance, but so is bying new batteries all the time.

   			Good Luck,
			Jim T.
