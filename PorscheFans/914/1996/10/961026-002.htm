Sounds like you may have some carbon buildup in your combustion chambers
and/or some stuck rings...  Pour some ATF down the spark plug holes and
let it sit for as long as you're working on the engine, if that doesn't
do the trick you may have to tear it down to clean it up.  Make sure you
turn the engine over to pump out the ATF before you put the spark plugs
back in... wouldn't want to hydro-lock the engine!  That'll cause a lot
more problems than a sticky motor....  (note huge understatement)  As
for the excessive end play, I' am not sure what the spec should be so I
can't tell you.  Perhaps someone with a little more type 4 experience
will be able to help you out.

As for the carbon (I'm thinking that's probably what it is) that can be
caused by a weak ignition system or a rich fuel mixture... perhaps it's
time to check those?

good luck,

nate
