OK guys, this one's strange.  

Before I started tearing apart my 75 2.0 liter, I could turn the crank by
hand by pulling the fan belt.  Yesterday, while replacing the pushrod tubes
and seals (yes, with Viton seals), I decided to turn the engine over again
to move the cyclinders around to dismantle the rocker assemblies.  Wow, all
of a sudden it's hard to move the crank.  So I take the rockers off and
pushrods out, spark plugs out, and try again.  

Now the engine turns freely until it hits TDC for cylinder #1.  Then it
freezes.  Turn it the opposite direction, the same result.  I can get it to
turn past this point, but it is difficult and doesn't feel very good forcing
it.  The engine also has a slight bind when I pass TDC for cylinders 2/4.
Furthermore, what is the usual end play?  The crank seems to be sliding in
and out a lot.

So what's the problem before I tear the heads off?  Is this a bearing
problem or something less critical?

Immediate wisdom is appreciated!!!

Regards,

Dion
