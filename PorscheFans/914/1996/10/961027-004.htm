Good point Jeff. Also Dynomax. I've heard of people using simple turbo
mufflers as well. But as for back-pressure, sometimes more is better. It
all depends on where you want your power. Lowering the back-pressure
helps higher flow at the top end, but you can also lower it to the point
that the bottom end suffers, sometimes badly depending on the engine.

> Josh, are you using the Supertrapp?

Nope, still have the Bursch muffler. But I know a few people who are.
The next exhaust evolution on my car will be a tuned header system. But
that won't be for quite a while.

The opinions here are those of the idiot that wrote it. Namely ME, so
don't go suing the DOE, they don't care...
