Josh,

I don't know about some kind of electrical gremlin due to your fender
squish, but I had the same problem last year with mine.  After checking
everything in the car first (about a 3 week process), it finally came down
to a bad starter.  The reason I checked it last was because I had just
bought that starter about a month earlier.

I took it back, got a 'new' rebuilt starter for about $50, and it started
right up.

Besides, most good parts shops will check your starter for free.  Give it a try.
