I have a 74 2.0 with dual 36mm dell's. I had alot of the same problems 
that you had before I put the MSD on. I have an MSD 6A, and gap the 
Bosch Supers at 0.050". It made such a difference that I could hardly 
believe it. Low end torque, drivability, etc... The only catch is that 
your tach probably won't work once you put it in. Instead of paying $40 
for MSD's tach adapter, I took a look at it and realized that it was just 
a single sided transformer (ie. a coil). So I essentially run the new 
system in parallel with the factory system. I run the plugs off of the 
MSD, the tach off of the factory coil. I also use an MSD Blaster 2 coil. 
A side benefit of this system is that I can always switch over to the 
factory system by disconnecting the MSD trigger and moving the dist-coil 
HT lead over from the MSD coil to the factory coil. Works great.
