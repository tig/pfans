" 914ers,

After pulling apart my P&C's the other day, I noted that the cylinder 
walls
were scuffed.  Not real bad, but enough on both the pistons and 
cylinders to
bother me a bit.  One source tells me this is due to high heat and 
possible
piston skirt collapse or a bent rod."

  I have heard of the high heat reason before; I consider this the most 
likely cause.  A collapsed piston can be detected with a suitable 
micrometer; as to bent rods, you said pistons (plural)... I would think 
multiple bent rods highly unlikely.

 "Another source tells me it's grit
and dirt and probably has toasted the bearings as well."

  In my humble opinion, this too is highly unlikely.  You didn't mention  
how the oil pressure was before you tore it down, but if the pressure 
is all right, then the bearings are probably all right.  Grit and dirt don't 
get into the oil system very readily; that's why there is both a screen 
and a filter.  If a piece of something came from somewhere, it usually 
does damage in a particular area, and then either imbeds itself in 
something soft, and so is removed from consideration, or is trapped 
by the oil filtration system.  Unless you have been using sand as an 
oil additive, you can probably rule out extensive damage from dirt or 
grit.

 " Is there
another way to check bearing wear without cracking the case?"

  I mentioned oil pressure prior to tear-down earlier... failing that you 
might just wiggle the rods on the crank and see how much angular 
play they have; you might also push and pull them and see if you can 
feel a "bump" (equivalent to a rod knock), but you would need a lot 
more experience than I have to judge engine condition that way, 
unless the rods are terribly loose, in which case it's overhaul time.
  Other than that, it's split the case and get out the plasti-gauge, plus 
visual inspection of course.

  Best of luck, and by all means, get some more input.
