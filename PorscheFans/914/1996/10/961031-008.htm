I am running a similar 2.0 engine but with 40mm Webers.  I have found that 
adjusting the accelerator pump volume worked well to smooth out these
problems.
Is this adjustable on the Dellortos?  Also, what is your timing set to?

I am running the MSD6AL and the MSD blaster2 coil.  I have found that it made
no difference in the way I set up the carbs.  I had the same problems with it
hooked
up and with it disconnected.  The Accel system you are currently using is
probably 
giving you a hot enough spark. The only thing you might gain by going to MSD
is
a rev limiter. (but accel probably has one available too) 
I wouldn't read too much into that "multi spark" business.
