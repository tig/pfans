Temp light? I didn't know there was such a thing. I _thought_ all 914s
came with temp gauges, and _some_ had pressure gauges.

As for the pressure sender, I have a dual sender installed. This way I
have not only an anolog reading of my oil pressure, but an idiot light
to tell me to shut off my engine if I'm too absorbed to look down at the
pressure gauge. 

I've seen a couple of 914s with the 911 gauge installed, mostly, the
fuel gauge gets moved down to the center console. One car that was
without center console, installed it in the dash next to the steering
column. An awkward location, but it was out of the way.

Everything expresed here is the opinion of the idiot that wrote it, 
namely ME. So don't go suing the DOE, they don't care...
