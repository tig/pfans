	If you can get the 0.009" blade in there at all, then by definition
the gap is at least 0.009".
	The best thing to do is find someone who has adjusted valves (not
necessarily a 914 in this case) and get them to either do one of your valves,
or to check one you've just done.
	John Muir probably has a decent verbal description--I don't remember
for sure; it's been a while since I last read that section of the Idiot Book.
	My own approach is to get things tight enough that I can "just move"
the gauge in the gap.  The "push" direction is most important, since the gauge
will flex if you push it from one end and it is firmly held on the other end.
The valve train has a fair amount of oil all over it, so the measurement is
done with oil on the gauge.  It seems to work for me so far (knock wood).
