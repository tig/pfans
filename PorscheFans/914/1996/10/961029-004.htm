As usual, thanks for the input.  It seems that all the 'strange' advice I'm
getting is from some of the VW shops in CA.  

As for the oil pressure of the engine before the teardown, I don't know what
it was.  I just purchased the engine about a month ago.  The interior of the
case and heads is ultra-clean.  Even the filter and oil screen were clean.
(I broke the filter apart)  Only the pistons were gunked up.

I'll keep everyone up to date as to the progress.

Thanks again,

Dion
