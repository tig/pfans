	Of course some upgrades are always possable.

	I have built a better than stock 2.ol for a friend. What We did 
was to add a new cam (WEB #73) with hardend lifters.  Euro Pistons (MALE) 
8.0cr, then he shaved the heads by 52/1000's which raised it to 9.0cr, he 
stuck with SSI hear exchangers (I would have gone to headers (Kerby Hunter)).

We then richen up the FI by bosting the Input pressure to 39 lbs. You 
could do the same by adding 50 ohm restior in line with head temp sensor.

All in all, his street car has more street power than my track car (which 
is a stock eng. with headers)

I have found that the male forged pistons are great they can take a bent 
or dropped vale and still be rebuilt.

Greetings fourteeners,

Happy halloween....

hey, I have a quick (and probably dumb) question here regarding jackstands.

Whenever I need to do anything to the front of the vehicle (brakes etc) I
place my jackstands right on the torsion bar tubes on either side...make
sense?

now, my problem is; where do I place the jackstands when I need to access the
torsion bar tubes themselves?...I am changing all the shocks, so I obviously
can't use my "normal" spot...:(

Is there a good place to plant jackstands, other than right on the torsion bar
tubes?

Any thoughts? TIA...

Cheers
Thom Kuby
