Greetings to all!

Thought I'd take an opportunity to introduce myself.  Most importantly (for
the part of this list) I have a 75 914 2.0.  Low miles.  At first
impression, very clean.

After a summer of fun driving, I have begun the transformation to a *SP
autocrosser.  I will soon be publishing a web page describing all the
modifications and maintenance for this car.

To help with my initial research, I would be interested to survey list members
who are racing 914's as to what type of racing and level of modifications.

Also, any comments regarding parts sources would be appreciated.  I have my
own opinions about quite a few now, but would like to publish a less-biased
view of the major (and minor) suppliers.

Please send replies directly to my personal e-mail address so as not to bog
down the list.  If I receive feedback, I will post a summary of the results.

Thanks in advance.
