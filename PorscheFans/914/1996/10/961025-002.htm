I'd try good ol' penetratin oil.  A coupl o' times if necessary, then if
that doesn't work, maybe heat the lock-nut with a propane tourch to
break the rust. (you did try backing off the lock-nut before turning the
adjusters, didn't you?) I don't think the heat will hurt if used within
reason the calipers see a lot during normal ;-) operation. The inside
one can be reached after you remove the hex-head cover plate. I finally
located a long hex wrench and had to do a couple of sessions with the
pen. oil and a few prayers (this works best on Sunday morning), but it
came off OK. Also those trick hex wrench sockets on about a 6-in.
extention will do.  It's a fun operation, but you might look and see if
the PO has replaced these hex covers with the Automotion/Performance
Products 10mm bolt type. Just a precaution ;-).

In answer to your later question, I know you will need to get to both
inside and outside adjusters to set the clearance for the new pads.

Since the first trying operation, subsequent pad replacements have been
a piece of cake. Just put a little oil on the inside cover plates before
you put them back.

It's fun, really.
