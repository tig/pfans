First off, the miatas along with the 914s have been moved into b-stock.
A well driven and well set up stock 914 can still give the miatas a run
for their money. As for what class you'd be in...

Strictly speaking, I don't think the 100# springs will be allowed.
Anything other than springs that are stock weight and stock height will
bump you into Street Prepared.

A rear sway bar with stock rear springs is a good idea. But as you
stiffen the springs, the rear bar will add too much roll stifness and
you'll get wheel lift. An adjustable front sway bar would be a very good
idea. I have a 19mm weltmeister bar, and I find that it's a very good
set up for my car. Yours may differ. Some really hefty stopping power
will help. Try something like performance friction carbon pads.

Nonesense! You'll be lunch for CRXs, RX-7s, and whole host of other BS
zippy cars too. Don't give the miatas all the credit! ;)

If there is a rookie program in your region, I highly recomend starting
in that if you can. You'll learn more, and won't get discouraged as
easilly.

I would recomend Yokohama A008Rs, they'll last longer than the BFGs and
will tolerate more abuse than the BFGs. They don't stick  as well, but
then you probably aren't going to be fighting for that top trophy yet
anyway. The Yokes are very good tires to learn on. Of course if you have
an unlimited budget, go for BFG. But chances are you'll burn 'em up
pretty fast while you're on the steep part of the learning curve.

About $500 for a set of BFGs or Yokes. 

Have fun! That's the most important thing of all.

The opinions here are those of the idiot that wrote it. Namely ME, so
don't go suing the DOE, they don't care...
