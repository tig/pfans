Nate,

Thanks for the advice.  Unfortunately, I found out the hard way.  I pulled
the passenger side head off today and the #4 piston came right with it.
That thing wouldn't come off to save my life.  And it's still stuck.

Nate was right.  Excessive carbon buildup in both P&C's.  The rings don't
look too good either.  The good news is that the crank turns over smooth as
silk now.  For now I'm letting it sit to cool down a bit.  (me, not the motor).

Anybody got a set of Euro P&C's they'd like to sell?

Thanks again,

Dion
