  914ers,

After pulling apart my P&C's the other day, I noted that the cylinder walls
were scuffed.  Not real bad, but enough on both the pistons and cylinders to
bother me a bit.  One source tells me this is due to high heat and possible
piston skirt collapse or a bent rod.  I don't think it's the later, because
the scuff marks are even with horizontal.  Another source tells me it's grit
and dirt and probably has toasted the bearings as well.

The last thing I wanted to do was crack the case and mess with the bearings
(due to past experiences).  What is the opinion of the list?  Is there
another way to check bearing wear without cracking the case?

I can't afford a major rebuild at this time due to lack of funds and getting
married in February.  Let me know what you think.

Thanks,

Dion
