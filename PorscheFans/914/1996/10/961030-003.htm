	The "oil" light on the 914 is an oil pressure light, not an oil
temp light.  The kit you buy from AA (and other places) replaces the sender
for that light with a larger sender that will run the light and a gauge.
	Some 914s (the center console ones, and all 2.0s, console or no)
came with an oil temp gauge.
	The sender is in the bottom of the engine, above the "other" round
sump plate--the one at the left-front of the engine, with two bolts holding
it onto the case.
	You'll need the sender, the plate with the adaptor, and the wiring.
Stock wiring goes across the front of the engine, and up through the sheet-
metal over on the side to one of those box-connectors.  From there is goes
into the main harness, through the firewall, and up to the center console or
the dashboard.  If you can find the wire (check Haynes for the coloring),
you can use that, otherwise you'll need to run a wire for it.  Come to think
of it, you'll have to run a wire for the pressure gauge anyway.  It's not
too hard; Josh2 and I ran a few wires into his main wiring harness using a
coat-hanger.
