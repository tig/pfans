Gentlemen:

  Please find reproduced below the text of a reply by Porsche in 
Stutgart to a query that I sent them about a month ago regarding the 
cylinder head temperature parameters for a 914.  Specifically, I asked 
for the normal operating range and the never-exceed temperatures.  I 
didn't exactly get what I asked for;  I think that you will find the third 
paragraph especially interesting / amusing.

CYLINDER HEAD TEMPERATURE PARAMETERS OF PORSCHE 
914

Dear Mr. Thorusen,

During the model year 1970 up to model year 1976 we built the 
vehicles of the type 914 in cooperation with the Volkswagen AG.

In those years we equipped the four cylinder vehicles with engines 
made by Volkswagen and the six cylinder vehicles with engines made 
by Porsche.

Since we never had any problems concerning extended cylinder head 
temperature we did not find necessary to publish technical data to this 
topic in our workshop manual.

For checking the temperature sensor II, which is situated close to the 
spark plug for the 3rd. cylinder, you will have to work in the following 
procedure:

Disconnect plug, connect ohmmeter between temperature sensor II 
and ground, read indication.

Nominal value:   0.5 - 2.5 kilohms (very temperature sensitive, value 
decreases with increasing temperature).

Guide value       approx. 2.5 kilohms when engine temperature is 
approx. 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).

Replace unit if necessary.


Kind regards,

Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche

  So... I have already composed a similar letter to Wolfsburg... I have 
included for emphasis a summary of the sad tale told on this mailing list 
recently about an engine meltdown in the desert, and practically 
begged them for a response.  We shall see what we shall see...
  At any rate, I thought that all the 914 guys would get a kick out of 
Porsche's opinion that you are all driving VW-Porsche half-breeds, and 
that they never overheat.
				Best Wishes,
				Jim T.
