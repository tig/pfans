Great commentary Josh. Your mention of the supertrapp reminded me that 
my tuner friend dyno'd one on a 914 reference to track noise limits. He 
found that if it's quiet enough for the track (let alone for the street)
the back pressure is as high or higher than a good performance muffler. 
He he said drilling a hole in the end-plate will give reasonably low 
backpressure and better performance (I don't know what that does for the 
sound).

Two years ago when he rebuilt my heads he really liked the dyno 
performance of the 2.5-in id. Borla (both standard 20-something inch 
oval and their trick racing muffler) also the top-end 2.5-in Walkers. 
Discounted, the Borla is about $100, and the Walkers are Chevy-cheap at 
about $30. These were tested with Bursch collectors, as Josh suggested.

Josh, are you using the Supertrapp?

Jeff
