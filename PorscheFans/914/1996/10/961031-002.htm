>Ralph Ricks, what's your high-performance commuter got in it?

The engine was already modified when I bought it.  It has a 
counter-balanced crank, which is very nice.  It has a very high lift 
cam and won't idle much below 2500 with stock EFI, but boy those top 
end revs!  I have twiddled the EFI, and have more things to try. 
It also has 96mm jugs with hi compression.  If I ever have to rebuild 
it, I will probably go with hyd lifters.  

Since you want to compete with this engine, you will want to know what 
mods you are limited to.  As someone said, it is silly to cheat in a 
competition.  

You can get the most bang for your buck with higher compression, if 
that's allowed.  Shaving the heads is not quite as good as hi comp 
pistons, due to the resulting shape of the chamber, but certainly lots 
more affordable if you do not have to replace the old jugs anyhow.
I burn regular (unl.) in my '76 with stock compr, so lots more compr 
(and power) is possible with prem gas.

You should measure the head volume with a liquid and test tube, just to 
be sure what you have.  
7.6 pistons have a 1 mm stepdown like this:
                        --________________________--
8.0 pistons are dished:
                        --          ___           --
Sorry, I can't draw the arc.
