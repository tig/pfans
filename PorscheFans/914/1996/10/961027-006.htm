Not really. A 914 engine can be built to acheive 7k without too much
effort (beyond a normal rebuild). One of the main limiting factors in
the 6k redline is there is simply no point to reving a stock 914 engine
past 5.5k. The power dies off quite rapidly beyond 5.5k, and that is
primarilly a function of the valvetrain's ability to suck in enough air.

No problem. A better cam and induction system will be neccessary. But 9k
will require some significant work and will certainly result in
significantly reduced lifetime.

So what is your primary desire for more revs? The big time EP cars in
SCCA will turn above 8k and with CR of over 15:1. But this will usually
result in a lifetime of about 10 hours.

As with any effort to increase power in a 914, efforts must be made to
increase cooling. Power is never free, and will almost always result in
an increase in heat.

The opinions here are those of the idiot that wrote it. Namely ME, so
don't go suing the DOE, they don't care...
