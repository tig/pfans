Thanks for the engine upgrade advice.  I'm not looking to build a rocket,
therefore I don't need a lot of the hi-priced mods suggested.  I'm just
looking to get a 'little' more performance while retaining the same basic
stock layout of the engine.

After all, autocross is more driver skill than raw horsepower.  And since
I'm running with a local club and not trying to win the national FP cown,
I'm going to stay mild on the power enhancements.  Besides, a friend of mine
runs a close-to-stock carbed 2.0 liter and consistently beats Cobra's, 911's
and Vette's.

And for everyone who thinks my life is over after the wedding, my fiance
tells me last night that she wanted to use all of our wedding money for
updates to the 914.  Purely her suggestion, I didn't even bring it up.
Let's see, with about 340 people coming to the reception...   :>)

Thanks again!

Dion
