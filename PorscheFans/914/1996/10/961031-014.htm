Ok folks,

	Here's the situation so far. The starter still turns over _real_ slow
with my optima batery. Even after I put my 10A automatic charger on it
for hours. I cleaned _all_ the main hot and ground connections that
could have an effect, no change. I compared the voltage off the
alternator to the voltage off the batery thinking maybe my alternator
wasn't puting out enough to recharge the batery. The alt was at 13.5V
and the batery was at about 11.2V. Hmm, I decide that the batery is
suspect. I bring the batery in for a load test at my regular shop (the
place I run to when I run out ideas) this morning. And they loan me a
conventional batery in the meantime. Put in the conventional batery and
VROOM! It started right up. Interesting, we compared both bateries on
their 40A mongo charger and both read full charge. Yet the voltage on
mine was a full 1.25V down from the loaner, and that was on the surface
charge. I could see it fading on the DVM. So, I leave my batery with
them for a load test (it's under still warantee) and it comes back just
fine after they charged it for a few hours on mongo. So I'm going back
today to get my old batery back and put it in. 

Now my questions to those in the know. If my old batery goes in and
starts my car just fine, do I just have an ultra whimpy charger that
can't be trusted in automatic mode? Should I leave the charger on manual
and just force the batery? It's an Optima gel cell batery. Should I give
up hope on my (up 'till now) trusty 10A batery charger? If the old
batery still doesn't hack it, what's going on? Is the starter more of a
load than the load test?

Everything expresed here is the opinion of the idiot that wrote it, 
namely ME. So don't go suing the DOE, they don't care...
