I have what may be a very stupid question...

I can't remember what feeler gauges to use for the adjustment ('76 914
2.0), so I'll just pretend it's .008in for intake, and .006in for
exhaust.  So, I begin the adjustment by rotating the engine so cylinder
#1 is at TDC.  I've got the valve cover off, and tools in hand.  I
loosen the locknut on the rocker, slip my feeler in-between the rocker
and the valve stem, and tighten the screw.  The question is... when do I
stop tightening?  I assume that if I can slip the appropriate feeler
in-between the valve stem and rocker without any resistance then it's
too loose, and if I can't get it in at all, then it's too tight.  But it
seems that I can adjust with a .008in (for example) feeler, tighten when
I have "moderate" resistance, and still be able to slide a .009in in
there without too much difficulty.  I understand that it's pretty
impossible to describe a sensation with e-mail, but is there a more
definite way of doing this?

Thanks!
