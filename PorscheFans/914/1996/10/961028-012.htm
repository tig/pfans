Help.

	I need someones wisened advice. The problem: very hard starting, the
engine barely turns over, and it takes up to 10 to 30 seconds for it to
catch. I've needed to bump it a couple of times now. The batery is fully
charged, I checked it when I got home. I'll check it in the morning
again, but even just sitting for 45 minutes, it barely started.

When I tried to start it twice today, I could see the parking brake
light dim while the starter was turning.

The history: Two weeks ago the front left fender got squished. I parked
it at work and then found later (5 hrs) that the starter wouldn't even
click. I figured that something shorted out. Had to get a ride home.
Later, I took out the batery and charged it. Not long after, it was dead
again. Ok, so just pulling headlight motor fuse wasn't enough, I went
and disconnected the headlight motors entirely and recharged the batery
again. This was working out just fine for a week and then the engine had
really hard starting again. I make sure I'm pointing downhill when I
park now so I can bump it.

So, is my batery toast? Is the starter toast? Is there something else
that I havn't thought of yet?

The opinions here are those of the idiot that wrote it. Namely ME, so
don't go suing the DOE, they don't care...
