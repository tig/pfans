Can you folks guess that my 914 is turning out more like a GT replica with
every passing day?

I'm currently a bit stuck progress-wise, as I await my machinist's return
from Inuvik.  The 914 is up on stands w/o a rear end until he comes back.
Can't even work on the lids, as the car takes up most of the available
garage space.....

But I'm the type who can't leave well enough alone, so I've started eyeing
the rest of the car.  From some pictures that I've seen, I noticed that the
GT cars got rid of those ponderous headlight motors, and used cables instead.
I believe there is also some sort of hydraulic strut that is used too.

Is anyone out there familiar with that setup?  Do the cables raise the
lights and the struts retract them, or vice versa?  The cables looked like
they were flexible in the photos, and they didn't look like a push/pull
arrangement, so how did the lights manage to stay in the UP/DOWN positions?
Was there some sort of friction mechanism or cable stop?

And while I'm at it, there looks to be some rust in the w/s cowl area, near
the cowl/fender junction (covered by that black plastic strip).  I'll be
cleaning that up when I do the bodywork.  But while I was in there.....I
noticed in the 914 Authenticity (XXX XXX) book that some early cars were
seam finished there.  Seems like a good way to prevent future rust problems.
How did Porsche do this?  I assume not via bondo....  Not likely a small
strip of metal welded in either.  Did they just put down a large bead to
fill to bridge the gap, and how do they manage to prevent the enclosed area
from becoming a potential rust trap?

Thanks for bearing with this esoterica,
Mike
