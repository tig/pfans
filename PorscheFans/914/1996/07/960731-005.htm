 But I'm the type who can't leave well enough alone, so I've started eyeing
 the rest of the car.  From some pictures that I've seen, I noticed that the
 GT cars got rid of those ponderous headlight motors, and used cables
instead.
 I believe there is also some sort of hydraulic strut that is used too.
 
 Is anyone out there familiar with that setup?  Do the cables raise the
 lights and the struts retract them, or vice versa?  The cables looked like
 they were flexible in the photos, and they didn't look like a push/pull
 arrangement, so how did the lights manage to stay in the UP/DOWN positions?
 Was there some sort of friction mechanism or cable stop?>>

They used pneumatic struts like the ones on 911's to hold up the lids  to
raise the headlites.  The cables released a hook that kept the lights down.
 The struts raised the lights.  The headlites had to be lowered manually.
 The cable was actuated by using the truck release handle which was unused in
the GT.
