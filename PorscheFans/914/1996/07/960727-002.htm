The 205/50-15 Yoko 008RS on my '73 9142.0L are getting very worn. I think 
I need to replace them soon.

What is the good choice? I've certainly liked these Yokos. I've heard 
that Yoko will soon have a new model and that the RS is discontinued. true?

Many people love their R1s.
There's talk about Hoosiers.

help, pls ..... (or is this a situation where there are as many opinions 
as people?)


ps: tire wear is important to me. I don't want to use a tire which wears 
out often and has to be replaced all the time. My Yokos have more than 25 
track days.
