heh, heh. .
  I used to have a 69 Dart Swinger, you know
with the 340 'wedgie' and iron 4-spd, big fat
stripes around the rear. . .cragar SS F60's.
  -a pocket rocket.  wish I still had it.
  Traded it in '74 for my 73 914 2.0L.
   (which I still have)

  My Yamaha 175 Last-of-its-breed has done
a fair job of pinch hitting too, but in kansas
the weather can get vigorous and those large
raindrops hitting the adam's apple really hurt
>50mph, and if you gotta haul a head to the
shop it has to go into a backpack for the ride.  Bummer.

  Cars sometimes resemble their owners.
  My dad had a rambler that, I swear had his teeth. . .
 -not to say my pop's teeth were chromed or bulbous.
  And the family now loves Chrysler products, and
so did I until I owned a few GM products.  Then I
got into P-cars.  I've hosed and been hosed by a
lotta makes/models in my days, so my opinions
on choice would go along the lines of cost and
maintenance practicality.  There is so much GM
stuff around that parts for nearly any model are
saturating the whole US.  Same is probably true
for Fords, but fords eat water pumps (imhe) and
I dont have a love for water pumps and belts.
  Chrysler scared me when they borrowed from
the gov'mt, and I drifted away. . .in my 914.
  For ten years that 914 was my ONLY conveyance
and we were both young and frisky until the miles
piled up and I got chintzy on car repairs (DIY).

  My vote is for GM.

  As far as insurance, its like a helmet. . .put your
cheap head in a cheap helmet.  OR, on the other
hand, put the public in a cheap helmet by not
insuring.  Insurance is taking responsibility for
damage you may cause by whatever flirtatious
behaviour you may be commiting when the
accident happens.  Some states require proof
of insurance on a vehicle before issuance of a
tag.  I carry at least liability coverage on all vehicles
in my fleet full time, and full coverage on the main
players full time.
  I could envisage a business that vends insurance
on an 'as-used' basis.  Sorta like coin-op coverage
for the conveyance of the day.  Any takers?

  So, please do insure at minimum
and, keep some spare hardware on hand.

  -kyle  (appology for lack of brevity)
