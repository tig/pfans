Mike,

>>Is anyone out there familiar with that setup?  Do the cables raise the
lights and the struts retract them, or vice versa?  The cables looked like
they were flexible in the photos, and they didn't look like a push/pull
arrangement, so how did the lights manage to stay in the UP/DOWN positions?
Was there some sort of friction mechanism or cable stop?<<

The cables pull the latch that allows the struts to raise the lights.  You have
to push the lights back down when done with them.  The cable is a single pull at
the dash then there is a special coupler that takes the action of the one cable
and breaks it out to two.  They then run to the individual light buckets to the
latch.  BTW, not all "GT" used this system, most rally versions used the motors.
And Big Cibi can also be found mounted on a few "GT".

>>And while I'm at it, there looks to be some rust in the w/s cowl area, near
the cowl/fender junction (covered by that black plastic strip).  I'll be
cleaning that up when I do the bodywork.  But while I was in there.....I
noticed in the 914 Authenticity (XXX XXX) book that some early cars were
seam finished there.  Seems like a good way to prevent future rust problems.
How did Porsche do this?  I assume not via bondo....  Not likely a small
strip of metal welded in either.  Did they just put down a large bead to
fill to bridge the gap, and how do they manage to prevent the enclosed area
from becoming a potential rust trap?<<

It was not welded it was leaded, and is still a rust trap, it can be found on
very early cars, mainly 914-6s, or I have never seen a 4 from the factory with
this done.  Welding may be the best way to seal it, but welding can also cause a
hole slew of problems.  I prefer to have the plastic so I can see into the
channel and check for rust. Just lift the plastic, and watch Iron Oxide form
right in front of your eyes.  It is a neat science project for you. <g>
