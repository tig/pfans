        Yes, it can.  The 1.8L ones are still available.
However, it wouldn't be the right part.  The amount of
air that is allowed through is a function of the temp-
erature, and is determined by the shape of the hole in
the rotating piece (see Probst's Bosch FI and Engine
Management).  So there would be not enough extra air, or
too much extra air, depending on how the holes compare
with each other.  Not a huge deal, but it is a difference
in the way they work.

        Actually the thermo-time switch is for the cold-
start valve.  The AAR has its own built-in bimetallic
thermo-time thing.

        Hmm.  I just recently (April or so) got one from
my local dealer (Carlsen) and it wasn't *too* expensive.
I'll sell it for...  What, $300?    ;)
        My old one works anyway, but is disconnected.  It
doesn't make much if any difference in my local climate.
