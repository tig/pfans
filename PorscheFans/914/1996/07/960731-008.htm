Thanks for all the replies about my queries; it seems like many of you
have had hands-on experience with the GT's....Cool!

I also found the Renegade 914 page (http://www.dgi.net/914/); they had
some pic's of some 914GT hoods (which I previously asked about),
including some close-ups.  Worth a look....

It sounds like the real GT setup would turn it into a PITA for a
streetcar.  I'm going to look at it a bit more closely tonight.
The headlight assemblies themselves seem light enough; maybe I can
fashion a push-pull cable assembly, with either the stock light
linkage or perhaps some helper springs.

I like the smooth look of the filled-in cowl/fender seam.  Maybe I
could weld it up most of the way around, and then inject some POR15
into the remaining openings....

BTW, are independent repair shops able to order OEM parts from PCNA?
A friend of mine who runs a shop (doesn't deal in any sort of car sales
tho') has offered to help me get things at cost if Porsche will allow
it.....

Thanks again for the info.
Mike
