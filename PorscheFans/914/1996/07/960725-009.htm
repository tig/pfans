My 914 also has dual Dells. The two hoses from the heads and the one from
the oil filler area meet in an aluminum box-like thing mounted on the
firewall above the engine. The box is an aftermarket VW thing (sorry about
the technical language) that has a sponge inside and vents to the air. The
oil vapors enter the box, are condensed in the sponge, and drain back into
the crankcase through the hose to the oil filler area. Make sense?

I have no oil sprayed all over the engine compartment. I suspect that this
breather box is common on some modified Bugs.

Hope this helps.
