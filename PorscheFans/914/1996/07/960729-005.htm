	Does anyone have a 914 AC setup that they would like to sell?

Ok, just to put things into perspective, you're in E stock for SCCA 
Solo II. Right? These aren't ACR Neons, and an Audi Powered 924
_should_ be able to hold it's own against the non-ACR Neons, VWs and
Civics.

_SLICKS_ will bump you into E Prepared, and have you against 
fire-breathing trailer-riding 510s. You do mean D.O.T. racing tires 
don't you? 

>It is not totally driver skill, I have pulled some near perferct runs
>and still lost by a lot! Imean floored going in, perfect execution
>and floored going out! 

I hate to say it, but on a 50-60 second course the 924 should not be
10 seconds behind a Neon. ACR or not. I would really focus on driver
skill. Just because you're floored going in and floored going out,
doesn't mean you'll be going as _quick_ as you can. Remeber, sometimes
going fast doesn't make for the best times. Get lots of seat time.
That will probably improve your times more than money will. And look
for an autocross school out there somewhere. I think the 924 should be
quite capable in E stock. Certainly not an overdog, but it should do
alright.

Sounds reasonable for street tires. But if your street tires are
almost bald, then I'd say you need some tires in a bad way. 
What is your alignment set at? 

>So is anyone crazy enouugh to trade me for their 914? ;-) 

Sure, give me a Boxter, and I'll give you my 914. Otherwise, Not a
chance. :)

Ok, now here's where you want to be careful of you go out and buy for
the car. Some things which seem fairly innocuous can bump you up into
a more competetive/expensive class.

I would first go with shocks and or tires. I don't remember the stock
wheel sizes, but unless you want to enter C Street Prepared, stay with
the stock wheel sizes. If you're running 14" wheels, go for the 205/55
race tires. I'd recomend the Yokohama A008Rs. They're not a sticky as
the BFG or the Hoosier, but they will last longer and aren't as
sensitive to bad alignment settings, driving styles, etc. It's a great
race tire to learn on. Shocks, go with Bilstien or Koni. They are
tried and true shocks and will improve the way your car drives
remarkably, especially if your shocks are old and worn out. Stick with
those for now. There's LOT'S of things you could do, but when you're
starting with a bone stock car, keep it simple and keep it cheap. Make
changes incrementally, that way you'll be able to get a feel for what
changes had what effect. You'll also gain a much better understanding
of your car in the process.
