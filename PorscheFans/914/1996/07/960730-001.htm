Yo,
  I run Kyb's on my wife's chevy cavalier. . .
gas charged and all, they work fine and seem
to last longer than 'red ryders'.  The gas charged
rears help to lift loads, and stretches tired springs.
  I run Boge's on my 914. . .they were reasonable
and I dont notice anything unusual about their
performance, good or bad.
  I've also run a set of Mulholland shocks from
the 70's on one of my 914's.  These had a lifetime
warranty.  They seem hard (and boring) and they
have lasted around 80 000 miles so far. . .
  I like to run gas charged shocks on the rear of
one of my 914's because the springs in it are age
softened.

  I dont race, but I do beat the traffic and city streets,
so I have a different perspective.
