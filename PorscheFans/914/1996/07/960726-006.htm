Here in Socalif the cheapest wheels are the 924.  I turned down one a 
friend sold with a seized engine for $200.  There is a 924 turbo 
advertised right now with bad clutch for $900.  

The all around best spare car for a 914 owner is an '80-82 Vangon.  A 
beater goes for less than $1500.  It is even better than an old pickup, 
because it hauld more and at a lower cg; and you can secure your cargo 
with lock and key.

What's more, you can swap engines between it and the 914 in time of 
need.  If you have a 914 1.8 with Ljet, this also gives you spare EFI.

I recommend the Vanagon instead of the 73-79 bus, because it hauls lots 
more, and it is far easier to work on.

Ralph  73 & 76 914 2.0  81 Vangon
