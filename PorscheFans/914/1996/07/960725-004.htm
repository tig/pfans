Greetings P-nuts,
I had sent this note about spare cars to JJ offline yesterday, but I
thought I'd toss it into the hat of collective wisdom here...enjoy.

J.J.
this is 1996...it is damn near impossible to get anything out onto the
street for less than  $1000.00
yes, people BUY stuff for less than that but then what does it take to pass
smog, be legal, be insured, be safe etc etc.

Having said all this...save up about a grand (or two) and go get a good
running full-size pickup.  sure, it'll be old and beat to shit, but you
won't care once you've lived with it for awhile.  I have a '76 3/4ton Dodge
club cab with a 318 in it.  I paid $900.00 for it from the original owner
who had EVERY receipt plus had the damn engine balanced and "slightly
blueprinted" (never did figure out what he meant by that-either you
blueprint or you don't)  Damn truck is the most reliable vehicle I own and
I've got three Porsches and one Honda Civic SI to keep it company.

Another thing about an old & beat  pickup...people actually get out of your
way on the freeway...I guess it's generally assumed the brakes are in the
same shape as the rest of the truck. (In reality, I have very good
brakes...I live in California)

So, in short J.J., forget the $300.00 threshold...raise the ante and get
something useful-trust me, you won't regret it.

Cheers
Thom Kuby
