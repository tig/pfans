I'm not so sure on the MAP sensor. . .
  I bought a new one last year from Zim's.
  -it set me back near $300 tho'  (OoowwW!)
  There are rebuilts available. . .check Pano.

 Furthermore, an aux air valve could be adapted
from a 944, or some years 914 (not sure).
  If memory serves, the aux valve is just for cold
start and is not a critical item. . .provided it works.
  All it does is leak air past the throttle body until
the thermo time switch tells it to stop. . .

  The cold start injector is the one I've heard is
unobtainium, but judging from Allen Caldwell's
Injector article in this mo's Pano, these last
forever provided they get a throrough flush on
occasion, they just crud up inside.

  My experience with the 914 FI system is that
it is amazingly simple and easy to work with.
  It is a very good place to start with familiarization
of FI systems.
