Fred,
The hoosiers have much wider profile and do rub on the rears of our little
pcars, you will a 1/4 inch spacer to help this. they are faster because more
rubber on the ground, depending on your fender clearance you might be able
to use them, I am using r1's as I don't want to take the chance on my
original paint.


These are race tires and will wear, I dont' know how well the hoosiers or
the r1's will last, but speed comes fwith soft tires which bring wear,
