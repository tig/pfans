Hello all!

My friend and I have just finished replacing the rusty old Delartos on
his '76 2.0 with a set of Webers.  After we fixed all of the fuel leaks
(20 year old hoses... yikes!), we tried to start it.  The engine turns
over, but refuses to start.  We know we're getting fuel to the carbs,
but this is where my knowledge stops.  I've debugged the FI on my 914,
but I know absolutely nothing about carbs.  Where do we start?  Is there
a checklist of things that we should check/tinker with in our debugging
process?  Any help would be greatly appreciated...

One more thing.  I was thinking the other day about how many people have
pulled all of the F.I. stuff off of their 914's and replaced it with
carbs.  I'm beginning to feel fairly confident in my ability to deal
with the d-jet, and also feel that better results can be achieved with
the stock FI.  What are my chances of finding a complete FI setup for
sale somewhere?  What would it sell for?  What is the availability of
the FI components (Manifold Pressure Sensor, brain, injectors, etc...)? 
Again, any help/advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks again!
