Phil van Buskirk posted a note about the upcoming Tustin Vintate Races this
weekend.  Here's more info.

The Marconi Foundation for Kids presents
Tustin Thunder Vintage Sports Car Races and car show, 100 Years of
Transportaton

When: August 2,3,&4, 1996

Where: Tustin Helicopter Station, Tustin, CA

Entry Fee: $25, which includes an event T-shirt, dash plaque, passes for two
to the grandstand race viewing and paddock area (A $95 value)

(Note, that's a special deal for all three days and displaying your car.
General admission is $10 per day, grandstands are extra).

Reserved Club Parking: Antiques, motorcycles, hot rods and race cars, etc.
(all forms of transportation) limit first 1000 vehicles

Proceeds benefit the following charities: Pediatric Aids of Orange County,
Covenant House, Olive Crest, U.S. Marine Morale Welfare and Recreation Fund.

Another flyer claims expected attendance of 100,000, over 100 vendors, 1000
cars and motorcycles on display, national TV coverage, WW2 airplanes, 2.2
mile track, "Legends" cars, celebrity race, exhibition race, radio controlled
car racing, food from around the world.

The featured cars of the weekend are pre-1973 Trans-Am cars, and the event is
dedicated to the memory of Jerry Titus.

There will be a party on Friday evening for sponsors, VIPs, drivers and car
owners. 

From the map I have, it looks like the car and bike show will be inside one
of the huge airship hangars. Just outside the hangar will be vintage aircraft
and current Marine hardware on display. Vendors and grandstands will be just
opposite the aircraft, so everything will be centralized. 

It might already be too late to get in on the $25 ticket deal, but it's such
a good deal (with T-shirt and all) that you might still want to try. Call
714-258-1820, maybe they can take your order over the phone and have tickets
waiting when you arrive. 

==================

John Marconi has a really neat collection of race cars. I haven't been to his
museum yet but he brings some of the hardware out to race it. As it should
be. At the recent Pomona races he had I think four cars out, including Keke
Rosberg's late-70s Formula Atlantic Chevron with the condom sponsor. Marconi
just plain drove around bigger F5000 cars. 

Looks like he has the angles figured pretty well on this event, including the
all-important advertising and marketing. I hope the event does well, we need
more of this in southern California.
