Text item: 


As long as the subject has come up, I have an additional question 
regarding insurance and race cars.  Is there any way to insure race cars 
for theft or damage which occurs while not on the track (e.g. fire at 
home, run away trailer...)?  I checked with Allstate (my home and car 
insurance carrier) and they indicated the following:

  o     my race car is not covered for theft at home or on the road
  o     my race car is not covered for any damage that may occur while
        towing, or at home (e.g. fire...)
  o     any liability incurred while towing the trailer is covered
        by the towing vehicle's liability coverage

Ideally, I would like to have some minimal (high deductible) comprehensive 
coverage for the race car to cover a catastrophic loss.  Any ideas?

Hello all:

I was wondering how your street/track cars are insured.

My ins company won't allow any track use.  What do you do
when you hit the track?

Also, I spoke with Leland-West Ins Co about this, and they
have good programs; however you have to be a homeowner
to apply!  Anyone else know any good ins co's (w/phone # please)
that would work this out?  Does the PCA event cover you with their
insurance policy?

Lastly, My ins Co will assess the ACV of my 77 911s at a Max of
12K.  They don't take into account the full leather interior, turbo wheels
and new rubber, tail, 91 3.6 C2 motor etc.  How have others got around
this?

Thanks in advance!
