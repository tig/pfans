I found myself in a similar position last fall. I needed a cheap car to run
in the
Pennsylvania liquid sunshine we get all winter.

Try this...go driving around some new car dealer lots...in the back row
behind 
the building way out of sight...they sometimes keep the recent trade-in's
there to wait for the next auction.  Look for the cars parked in the back
with no license plates.

Pick one out & go right to the used car manager & offer to take it off his 
hands for the book wholesale amt, & tell him you know it may be a gamble
at auction where he may get less than that.  Note--you should know the 
wholesale amount before trying this.

This worked for me, I got an 88 Toyota with moderate mileage for $1450.
and the NADA retail on it was $3000.  It needed some cosmetics but
has been extremely reliable.

As far as your price range of $200-$300....forget it.  Unless you know
someone 
who you could talk into selling their car, you won't find anything worth
buying
in that price range.  

Good Luck
