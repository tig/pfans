Hello Mike,

  I dont know that much about the /6 GT :(
  but I have been around 914's enough to
illuminate some areas you mention.
  I wonder if a person could just remove the
headlight motors, and the gearing would
hold the lights in place?

  On the rust. . .if you have evidence of it outside the
cowl, you probably have more blooming up inside
the upper fenderwell and door jam.  This is a tight
place where a lot of metal joints are brought together
and so there are weird voids on either side of the
door pillar.
  The seam sealant has probably got a breech in it
somewhere in the fenderwell up high.  Peel some
of that back from the seams on the back side of the
rusty seam.  If it isnt too bad just re-caulk, but if it is
really bad you may want to consider repairs.
  A temporary stopgap would be to spray
the metal with zinc spray (cold-galv) and re-caulk
after some refinishing (if desired).  The secret of
preventing rust is to just seal, seal, seal but you
gotta have a good surface to adhere to.

  On the cowl seam;  I seem to remember that
GT's had those seams smoothed over?
  I doubt the factory used lead. .
  After all my doings with rustoring 914's, I would
say weld the seam shut since they are directly
above pinch welds of several layers of body
sheet metal.  Unless you intend to replace the
fenders at the seam, these should never get
disturbed.  I vote seal 'em up.
