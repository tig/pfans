    Mike:

    If you're building a track-only car, there's generally no need
    for the retractable headlights at all; if you ever find yourself
    running in a night race, you can just bolt big rally lights to
    the hood.

    If, on the other hand, you're planning for this car to be usable
    on the street, the cable-actuated headlights are going to make
    your driving experience pretty horrible (in my opinion).  As far
    as I know (as usual, I could be WAY wrong about this), the cables
    only raised the headlights; when dawn broke over the Sarthe, they
    were pressed back into place by the pit crew.

    The very early 914/6 that I helped prep for the class win at the
    concours at the San Diego Parade a couple years ago (my "help",
    by the way, was exceedingly minor... I'm in no way an expert on
    914 authenticity) had that seam welded shut.

    It was done just as you suggested, with a large bead filling the
    gap. It WAS, as you suggest, a potential rust trap, which may
    explain why the factory didn't fill the seam on later cars.
