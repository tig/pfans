  Dave D. replies:

  "According to what I read, the Viton seals hold up to heat a whole
lot better than the factory seals."

  I concur; the people at GPR tell me that they are reluctant to sell 
the original seals; apparently they have had very good luck with 
the Viton ones.  I have installed them on my 914, but as the car is still 
not together, I have no experience to report.

  Again Dave D. comments:

"I don't know that Viton seals in particular would fix this.  It sounds as 
if there's some other problem.  Check the hole in the head where
the tube goes, if there are rough or sharp edges (e.g., from the 
casting seam) knock those down with some sandpaper (CLEAN UP 
VERY CAREFULLY!). Maybe you forgot to lube the seals when you 
put them in?  Engine oil or that silicon lubricant stuff--*NOT* silicon 
sealer (RTV, "goop", etc.)."

  This sounds like a good sugestion to me, although I don't think that 
forgetting to lube an O-ring would be fatal...  I replaced one pushrod 
tube that had a dent in it... I suppose that it is possible to have them 
crack... Hey Dave, what do you think?
  The problem with the original O-rings is that they "coke up" or turn 
to brittle carbon with heat.  I don't know how long this process takes; 
however if you find this occuring so soon, then maybe you should 
look for signs of overheating?
  If the leak is still young enough (so that it has not dirtied up the 
whole engine) try to determine exactly where the leak is comming 
from.  This will be a big help in finding the problem and fixing it.
  If you do end up pulling the pushrod tube again, examine the 
O-rings carefully for damage; use a magnifying glass.  If you have 
torn one up, that will tell you where to apply Dave's cleanup ideas.  
One other possibility is a longitudinal gouge in the seating hole; such 
a gouge is a "ditch" that will allow the oil to run right under the O-ring. 
 This will be very difficult to detect with the engine in the car, but you 
might manage it with an inspection mirror.  As to how you would 
repair such a thing, I don't know; maybe boring out the hole and 
installing a sleeve; anyway, let's hope it doesn't come to that!
  In closing, let me just reiterate what Dave has already told you; DO 
NOT USE GLUE!  The pushrod tubes are designed to slide in the 
holes to allow for thermal expansion and contraction of the engine; if 
you glue them, the glue joint will just break, and the leak will 
re-appear.  (Not to mention that someone tried to RTV my engine 
before I got it, and not only did it leak worse than ever, but the glue 
was impossible to remove with the engine in the car... man, I mean it 
was everywhere!
			
  Dave continues:

 "You can get Viton seals from your local Bug shop (same seals as 
the other Type IVs) or from GPR."
