Hello All -
I have just the right car for sale to anyone desiring their first entry into
PCA's Club Racing scene.  I am selling my first race car, got another in the
works and this one has to go first...  Here are the details/highlights...

Car has been repainted (by a previous owner) "blue" and has knicks, pits,
rock chips, etc. but is straight, solid and true.  Car is a stiff club
racer.  It has a 50/50 paint job (looks great from 50' at 50 MPH).  Original
color was metallic blue.  Car has "no" rust in the "bad" spots.  Car has
been maintained by Steinels Autowerks in Cleveland and Auto Assets in
Columbus Ohio.  Car has been lightened (2139 lb.) to the letter of the law
for PCA Club Racing and is very competitive in class. Have tons of receipts...

Price - $10,000 - you could not replicate this *dependable* - *no muss*, *no
fuss* car for this amount of money,  includes LOTS of spares & pieces parts.

I will be at Roebling Road, 45 minutes west of Savannah, Georgia for the PCA
Club Race December 6,7 and 8 with the car.  Look for the metallic grey Auto
Assets Trailer Car #33 and see Chip Vance or call (614) 457-5443 EST before
12:00 Midnights.
