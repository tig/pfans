I too purchased the AA fiberglass bumpers (front and rear)about 1.5 years
ago.  They were also very hard to fit.  I did a lot of modifying (elongating
holes, trimming the rubber dogbones and redrilling the mounting area on the
bumper itself) to get those things to fit.  And yes, my hood doesn't fit
right either.  I have the dreaded 'bra' to cover that one up.  I hope to one
day be able to afford a nice set of shiny new chrome bumpers and rubber tops
to replace these things.  But for that price, I could buy another car!

Your right the quality was less than good.  Let us know the outcome of your
journey!

Regards,

Dion
