	I just started down this path, I bought the car for undert 2k, it 
needs interior, brakes, paint, & slight rust work. I of course think it 
is a good path all though it is a bear of a job, in that I sorta feel 
that because they are so rare that I should do a realy good job. It looks 
like the work breaks down like this:

Rust work - varies but assume 1 k
Paint ( you strip it) 1.5 - 2.0 k
Brakes - rebuild them  .3k
MOTOR - Just a light "freshen - gaskets - seals & rings 3k
Trany - .2 - .3k (it is a stock 14 trany so get a good old working one)
Interior - Not the same as the easy to get '14, so I am scrounging 
variours old stuff and trying to patch toggeter a basicly decent one.

Sweat - LOTS

Results: A car that can only go up in value and is a blast to drive.

BUT DON'T TAKE A REAL 6 AND MAKE IT A NON-STOCK CAR. Its is smarter to 
take a 4 and put in  a 6 if you want to build either a race/track car or 
a monster 3.x rocket.
