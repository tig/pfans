 " While cleaning the fan on my ready-to-be-reassembled 2.0 liter, I 
noticed that it only has the 27 degree BTDC notch (painted red).  Not 
remembering my geometry/trigonometry like I should, what is the 
correct way of finding the TDC mark?  I'd even like to add other 
marks for future reference.  "

  I don't know of a good way to do this for sure, but if we use an 
external reference (in this case, MY fan), we can develop the 
following EMPIRICAL information; use at your own risk.

  The TDC mark is supposed to be a 0 stamped into the fan edge.  
Since the 0 is a pretty wide mark, the measurement is going to be 
fuzzy, but here goes:

  Distance (CHORD, not circumferential) between 27 degree mark 
and TDC mark:
   Distance to NEAR edge of 0: 2.035 inches.
   Distance to Far edge of 0:   2.110 inches.
   	Width of 0 character:  .075 inches.
   Calculated distance to TDC is 2.073 inches.

  Distance from 27 degreees before TDC mark to 5 degrees before 
TDC mark:

   Measured distance (CHORD, not circumferential):  1.630 inches.

   Check distance:  Measured distance from TDC 0 to 5 degree mark:
	Measured distance to NEAR edge of 0:  .440 inches.
	Measured distance to FAR edge of 0:  .515 inches.
	Calculated distance to TDC:  .478  inches.


  These measurements were made using a dial caliper... therfore the 
distances are CHORD distances, i.e. straightline distances between 
the marks, NOT as you would measure with a tape wrapped around 
the fan.  I first tried using the inside diameter points on the back of 
the caliper. but found that the readings were inconsistent due to the 
shape of the points and the shape of the notches being different.  I 
found that the most consistent (and I hope, accurate) readings were 
done by laying the main caliper jaws flat on the rim of the fan, and 
eye-balling the center of the notches past the edge of the caliper 
jaws.  Most timing mark uses are not super critical, so I hope that this 
will allow you to get close enough.
				Good Luck,
				Jim T.
