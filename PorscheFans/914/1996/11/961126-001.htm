I retired my 1.7 in favor of rebuilding a good, used 2.0 liter.  You need
more than just the P&C's, heads and heat exchangers.  The crank and rods
have much to do with the increased torque and HP the 2.0 puts out.  A 2.0
liter crank won't fit in the 1.7 case.

I've seen used 2.0 liters on the market for about the cost of a 'new' set of
2.0 heads.  I'd go that way and still keep it smog legal.

My .02.
