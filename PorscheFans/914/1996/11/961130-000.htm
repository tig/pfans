<< I have come across a 914/6 in poor condition.  Although complete, it seems
to need 
 everything.  Has a little rust in the usual places, needs Ps & Cs, trans
rebuild, 
 paint, brakes, tires, and cosmetics etc.  
  >>
If there is a little rust, there is probably a whole lot more that isn't
visible.  Rust is a 914's single biggest enemy.  Check for rust under the
battery, and just forwad of the battery in the engine compartment, and the
passenger side rear suspension tie in for holes. Lift up the rear trunk mat
and look for rust in rear part of the trunk floor.  Check the outer rocker
panels; if they are rusted, the inner panels are almost certainly rusted just
as bad.  Rust in any of those areas MUST be investigated, and since the 914
heet metal is so thin, perforation has almost certainly occured.  Fixes are
available, but aren't cheap to intall since everything must be welded in
except the outer rockers.  In other words, serious rust equals "run away, run
away"!!

Also check your lids for the front and rear trunks.  If they are rusted, they
cost over $500 apiece new.  If you are from the rust belt, rust free used
ones are impossible to find.
P's and C's are about $1200 new.  Gasket sets are $150.  Then there are the
cams that may need regrinding, potential for new valves, head work, etc.
 Count on on $3000 in engine work.

How are the heat exchangers?  New ones, if you can find them, are over $1000
each side.

Figure $750 to rebuild the transaxle yourself.

If you REALLY want a 6, going to California, Florida, Arizona, would be a
better bet as you can find rust free examples there if you look hard. And
they'll cost a whole lot less than trying to salvage a rusty example.
