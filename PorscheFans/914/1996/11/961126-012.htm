Hello All -
I have just the right car for sale to anyone desiring their first entry into
PCA's Club Racing scene.  I am selling my first race car, got another in the
works and this one has to go first...  Here are the details/highlights...

Prepped for Stock 2 litre "J" Class club racing including:
K&N Air Filter

AM/FM Cassette (I've "never" used it though...)

Car ran a 1:54 with a previous owner at Mid-Ohio

Car has been repainted (by a previous owner) "blue" and has knicks, pits,
rock chips, etc. but is straight, solid and true.  It has a decent paint job
(looks great from 50' at 50 MPH).  Original color was metallic blue.  Car
has "no" rust in the "bad" spots.  Car has been maintained by Steinels
Autowerks in Cleveland and Auto Assets in Columbus Ohio.  Car has been
lightened (2139 lb.) to the letter of the law for PCA Club Racing and is
very competitive in class. 

Price - $10,000 - *dependable* - *no muss*, *nofuss* race car.
I will be at Roebling Road, 45 minutes west of Savannah, Georgia for the PCA
Club Race December 6,7 and 8 with the car.  Look for the metallic grey Auto
Assets Trailer Car #33 and see Chip Vance or call (614) 457-5443 EST before
12:00 Midnights.
