Several months ago, I purchased as part of a $700 order the above referenced 
fiberglass front bumper for my 914.  Since then, I have tried mounting it with 
and without the rubber dogbones, elongating the mounting holes in my sheet 
metal, and other "remedies" to no avail.  

Several regional PCA experts have come by to help me, and this is what we've 
discovered:
1. The bumper is about 1/2" too "flat" when viewed from the top and it sags 
about the same amount across the top when viewed from the front (its top rear 
edge goes UNDER the hood's front edge in the center when correctly aligned 
with the fenders at its ends).  It also has evidence of bubbles at the lower 
corners (something I could fix if it only fit).
2. The car (both front clip and hood) has no evidence of body damage, and both 
the original bumper and another steel bumper fit correctly.  We have also 
tried a different hood just in case that was somehow wrong, but there was no 
difference.

Our conclusion is that the workmanship of the bumper is inherently poor - 
either the mold was not true or the part was separated prematurely and laid 
down where it flattened before it cured.

If you have the part in stock and I can return the one I have for one that is 
shaped correctly, that would be my preference.  I'm open to other options, 
however.  I will, if you'd like, return the bumper I have so that you can see 
for yourself the problems is has, but I wouldn't call it "resalable" as your 
return policy requires - of the six 914s available for comparison to mine, it 
would fit none.

I realize that my purchase was considerably more than 30 days ago, and I don't 
know if I can find my packing slip or not.  Both of these lapses on my part 
were the result of my confidence in your company's quality assurance and in 
your personal commitment to do the right thing should a problem arise.  I have 
no "rights" to exert, but you have the opportunity to show a fairly large 
group of committed 914 enthusiasts how Automobile Atlanta handles problems 
experienced by its customers with the merchandise it sells.

I can be reached via email at M-D-Nugent@msn.com or by telephone at work (206) 
865-5908 (Pacific time zone).  Thank you.
