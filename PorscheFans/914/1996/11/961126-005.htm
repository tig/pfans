I put a temporary replacement in my 914 that has served well for over a year.
It's made from a piece of bent coathanger wire wrapped in electrical tape. As 
long as it works, I'm leaving it there.

I'm wondering though, did you buy the plunger for the 911 or the 914? I think 
they are different lengths.
