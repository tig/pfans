That's a REAL GOOD idea...I'll second that one for J.J.,  A lot of DIY
mechs totally ignore these trigger points, which are accessable only with
the dist. out of the vehicle.  Another thing you might to check, J.J., is
the brain connection on the trigger points as well.  Make certain
everybody's on board there, or there won't be any fuel going
anywhere...such as the problem you're experiencing now.

Also, but this is for basic electricity, go back to the relay board and
keep looking around. My car refused to start for days until I started
juggling those fuses around on that board.  Those $%@# Dutch fuses will
croak, but they'll look just fine.  Change em.

Also, Have you made sure the fuel pump is all there? got a fresh filter?
etc? etc?

Asofar as timing is concerned...I suggest you go to the FLYWHEEL...not the
fan, and look for TDC, which will be a very grooved mark-can't miss it, and
make sure you are in fact on #1 TDC, and go from there.  My  limited
experience tells me that 30 degrees btdc @ about 3500rpm should be about
right.
Reason for the flywheel?  simple, these cars are old... those impeller fans
can come off of anything...with enough timing marks  (both real and
imagined) to really make things miserable...

In my case, I found TDC on the flywheel to correspond perfectly with the
Haynes-spec 27 degree BTDC mark on the fan...nice, huh?

Let me (us) know how you do...

Cheers
Thom Kuby
