Excerpts take form Caldwells response to question on 914 fog light rewire.

-------------------------------------------------
You will need access to the fuse panel and the back of the fog light switch
only.

First, the power source must be changed from the head light switch to the fuse
panel(No. 8 , 9 if
you want the fog lights to work only with the ignition switch on or No. 10, 11,
or 12,  if you want
them to work any time regardless of ignition switch position.

Note the input side of the fuse panel is toward the rear end of the car.  The
input side of No. 8 and
No. 12 have spare terminals for connection of accessories.   The black wire with
blue stripe is
disconnected at the rear of the fog light and taped over, and a new wire is run
from terminal 15 on
the fog light switch to the fuse panel. ( No. 8 or No. 12)

Once you have power to the fog light switch independent of the headlights, the
only remaining task
is to make sure the fog light relay will work with the high beams on.  In the
factory wiring for the
1974 and 1975 models, the fog light relay solenoid output is connected to the
input side of fuse
No. 1 by a white wire with a blue strip.  Fuse No. 1 supplies power to the left
head light high beam,
so when the high beams are on the relay is blocked by 12 volts from this wire,
thus not allowing the
relay to function.  The solution is to disconnect the fog light relay relay wire
(white wire/blue stripe)
from fuse No. 1 and ground it, so that every time the fog light switch is
activated the relay will close.

WRITERS NOTE( I would take the time to change the white wire / blue stripe to a
BROWN wire so
any future diagnostics of the circuit will be little more intuitive.  Brown is
used in most European
cars to denote ground ( color of the earth ).  Porsche just follows this logical
wiring scheme, unlike
most US cars which us black, and house wiring which uses green. Just my .02

For 914 prior to 1974 the operation is similar except for the differences in the
original factory wiring
of the fog light relay solenoid.  The 1972 and 1973 models have both white /
blue wires (one for the
fog light relay and the other to the high beam indicator) going to the input
side of fuse No.1. So the
tricky part is to determine which wire is which (either a voltmeter or Trail and
error work) and to
leave the high beam indicator attached to the fuse, while grounding the fog
light relay wire. The
1972/73 models also have the relay solenoid terminals connected differently with
the gray/red wire
going to the relay terminal 86 and the white/blue wire exiting form terminal 85;
however, this does
not affect the rewiring process.  The 1970/71 models have the white/blue wire
output from the relay
solenoid attached to the high beam current supply at the combination relay
rather than at the fuse
panel, so the wire can be cut near the relay output and and grounded.  The 914/6
is similar to the
1972/73 model.

End of excerpt.

This is one solution that works, I am going to go and check how I did it on my
car tonight.  And will
respond tomorrow with my solution, which was to take the the black/blue wire and
move it form
terminal 56 on the headlight switch to Terminal ???.  This makes it so the fog
lights can be run in
the 1st position and with low beams on, but cuts them out with high beams on.

Note: you never want to use high beams in fog, snow, or other reflective
conditions.  The high
beams will reflect off the fog and create a blind spot, you can not see past.
So in those conditions
the low beam fog combination should be superior. On my car I run 55 watt lows
and 100 watt high
beams in a Cibie Z beam H4 conversion.  I also use a halogen bulb conversion in
the fog lights, can
look up the manufacture P/N# if interested.  It happens to be a 55 watt unit
also.

>I know this is an easy "switch the jumpers on the light switch" fix.  I have
>a '74 914 2.0l with the Appearance Group.  I want to be able to turn on the
>parking lights and be able to operate the fog lights switch in this
>position.  More clearly, with the Headlights switch in the first detent
>(parking lights on), I want to be able to turn on and off the Fog Lights
>(the ones in the bumper).  Thanks...
