After studying my car and wiring diagrams from the factory manual, I think the
following should work.  It has on my car and should work for all years before 74
also.

I started by releasing fuse panel and fog light switch and head light switch if
I remember correctly, I am have removed the emergency flasher switch also.  Then
dropped the whole thing below the dash to work on it.  Take the black / blue
wire that runs from the fog light switch to the head light switch and remove it
from the head light switch. I think it is terminal 56 or  56k.  Can be tracked
by sight or by using an Ohm meter, with the headlight switch off.  Move the wire
to 58L, and reattach it there.  58L runs the side marker lights, according to
the current diagram, and the testing on a extra headlight switch.  Return things
back to normal.

Make sure you disconnect the battery ground strap, and follow the usually safety
precautions.

Note: You may have to add a female connector to the wire and or splice it into
the harness which ever you prefer.  Also use a quality connector, and make sure
it is insulated, Porsche used a brass or brass plated connectors and heat shrink
to insulate the connector.

Positives for me, this circuit  very little is done to disturb the cars wiring
harness, no runs to ground no changes to anything except now the fog lights come
on when your marker lights come on first position on the switch.
