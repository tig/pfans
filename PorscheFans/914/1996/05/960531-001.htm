Well, acting on the advice of everyone who has helped me so far, I went
back and checked all of the things that I had simply assumed were
correct.  Sure enough, I found a simple problem that quickly explained
why the car wasn't starting.  For some reason, I had the spark plug
wires set up so the firing order would be 1-2-4-3.  I don't know how
this happened, but they were quickly changed to be 1-4-3-2.  A little
too excited about the discovery, I broke the rotor while putting the cap
back on.  No big deal.  A ten minute trip to Checker and $2.19 later I
was all ready to start.  I turned the key... nothing.  All of this
attempting to start the engine had killed the battery.  I quickly
borrowed a neighbor's battery, and tried it again.  It didn't start.  I
then realized that I had set the timing 180 degrees off.  Since the
rotor doesn't want to flip 180 degrees cooperatively, I simply rotated
the plug wires on the cap 180 degrees.  At this time, a friend of mine
arrived with his '76 914 2.0 on a flat bed, and we were able to visually
inspect his distributor.  They both looked exactly the same, with the
vacuum advance in the same place, and the plug wires going to the same
places.  We attempted to start the car, and this time we actually had a
little flame burp up out of the throttle body!  We tried it again (and
again and again) but it never started, nor did it repeat the flame
thing.  Finally, my friend had the common sense to verify that we had
fuel.  We definitely have pressure, but low and behold, holding the fuel
injectors into a cup while trying to start it results in no spray at
all!  Seeing as how if there's no fuel to ignite, the car probably won't
start, I think we've found our problem.  It appears that the injectors
are just never receiving the signal to fire.  Looking at a wiring
diagram reveals that the computer and the distributor play key roles in
generating this signal, but I really don't like the idea of having to
replace either one of those.  What else can I look for?  Is there a test
I can perform to verify that the computer is working at all?  Dan said
something about some wires going "from the injector harness to the relay
board", but I've yet to check those.  Is there anything else?

Thanks again for everyone's time!
