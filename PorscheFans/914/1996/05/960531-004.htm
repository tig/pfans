OK...
- rotate dist.  so rotor points to #1 mark on rim of dist.
- loosen 10mm long bolt and turn dist. counter clockwise
-unplug the ECU line (the aforementioned four prong line) from dist.
-undo (love that word...) 13mm bolt holding dist. onto engine.
- remove dist.
- triggers are at base of dist., this is the plate where the ECU line plugs in.
-there are (should be, anyway) two screws holding this plate to dist. body
-remove these two screws
-wiggle the plate out...these are your trigger points.  this is a horseshoe
arrangement.
-like any other set of points, check for wear, etc.  if they are old and
look beat to shit, I'd change em.  Best price I was able to find was @
Carlsens Porsche in Palo Alto...but look around.  Prices are all over the
place.

Keep me (us) posted...and be patient...you are eliminating problems one by
one. You'll get it eventually.

Cheers
Thom Kuby
