Ack!  I swear, I think it's going to take me longer to get this car
started than it did to rebuild the engine.  Here's what I've got:  The
engine has been successfully re-assembled, placed back in the car, and
hooked up properly (I assume).  When I try to start it, the engine turns
over and everything works the way it's supposed to, but it won't start. 
I've got fuel pressure, fuel in the cylinders, oil pressure, spark, and
of course, air.  It sounds like a timing problem, right? O.K., here's
what I've done with that:  Found the TDC mark on the fan (pulled the
plug an looked at the piston... yep, TDC), put the distributor on,
inserted the rotor shaft, turned it until it pointed at the #1 plug
wire, tightened everything down, and tried to start it.  No luck, not
even a chance.  So, I figured I must have been at TDC Exhaust instead of
compression.  An easy mistake to make since the fan rotates twice for
each rotation of the rotor.  I pulled the cap, rotated the engine back
to the TDC mark, and sure enough, the rotor was pointing 180 degrees
away from the #1 wire.  So I loosened the distributor, and flipped the
rotor around 180 degrees.  The rotor would "catch" where it was supposed
to drop, but didn't want to drop.  I found that tightening the
distributor down while the rotor was at the "catch" point would indeed
drop it down.  So, if I wasn't at TDC compression last time, I'm there
now, right?  Tightened everything down, and it still didn't fire.  I
repeated this process of flipping and adjusting the rotor three times,
and called it a night.  Why won't this work?  A couple of questions came
up:  Which way is the vacuum advance mechanism on the distributor
supposed to face?  Towards the fan housing, or away from it?  Is the
rotor shaft only supposed to fit in one place, or can it be flipped 180
degrees?  If I'm just way off on this timing thing, what else could it
be?

It's a beautiful sunny day, and I'm stuck driving my brothers '84 Jetta
with no shocks and no radio.  I'm sure you can all understand my
desperation.  Please help if possible!

Thanks again and again!
