Aw, c'mon Mike, even you must want to Flame-A-T*d every now and then. Where's
your taste for sport? (Come to think of it, while T*d was on the 'Philes,
every day was like opening day of grouse season -- we'd never know where he'd
pop up, or what path he'd take, but we just blasted away regardless). I think
there is a place for flames, and every flame in its place. Like a separate
section. I figure we can do this in good fun, where we have some artificial
personality named Max Headgasket who can flame and be flamed in turn. It
would be in a separate section so those who don't care or for these brawls
can stay away. Not sure yet if/when we're going to do that, but it's an idea.
If a "discussion" turns ugly, that way we don't have to throw people off the
soapbox, we just move them to another corner of the park. Maybe with a public
announcement that "The discussion on such and such has been moved to a
Nomex-lined area under the heading xxx."

BTW I think your cc to "PorscheFans-944@ioio.com" didn't work, the right
address for watercooled 4-cylinders is PorscheFans-924-944@ioio.com"  

Anyway, thanks for your post, and let's get this thing rolling.

Pete
