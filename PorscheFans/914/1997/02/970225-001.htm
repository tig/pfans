I have a friend in Germany that is coming over in March.  I asked him to
bring me back the book "Das Grosse VW-Porsche-Buch" is certainly the best
book about the
914, that I have ever read. Unfortunately it is expensive  78,-- DM,
which
today is $ 46 . Let me know if and how many books you want. I have to
order
it and it will take about 4 days to get them. It only comes in the German
language, sorry.  But it is by far a must have for the 914 enthusiasts.

  Do to the time constraints, I need to know if anybody is interested in
getting one of these, and if you are act quickly because I need to give
him the order by March 1st, 1997.  Sorry for the short notice but this
was a quick thought, I have been trying to get my relatives to send me
one for years, but then either my German is rusty and or they don't read
books.

BTW, this is cost, I will not be making anything on these just passing
them onto others.  Sorry I don't have any contact into distribution
channels so this is the best price I can work out.

Take care,
