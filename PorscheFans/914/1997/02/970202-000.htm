Joe,

The my vote goes to the flat-6, and the 901 gear box.  The 915 conversions just
are not worth the added expense.  European car did an article back in Feb, 1988
on this conversion ran the part numbers and the whole bit, nice article.  Auto
Atlanta also sells a book, (not really), but is very detailed and gives a good
over view of the project.  BTW, if anyone has this EC article drop me note, I am
looking for a few pages of it that got misplaced, I think it is only the last 2,
but then need to check.

If you are considering doing a V6-V8 conversion do the homework, there are allot
of hidden cost in the kits.  There was a book put out by Hotrod I think that
covered the swap, called engine swapping, I have it if it is out of print, and
you want the article.  It also covered a Tornado in a 66 912, mid engine 912,
hmmm, makes the gears turn.  Remember spring rates will need to be adjusted to
carry this road hugging weight, be it Chevy, Ford, or 928, they all weight allot
more.  Of course you could use the Aluminum Buick (now Rover) V8, lighter, and
can be made to produce decent power.

Also you can consider a Mazda rotary, or Suib flat six.  One of these two would
take the cake for a light engine - non Porsche with some guts.  Of course the
Suib could almost be pasted off as a flat-6 to the non trained eye.  Seen the
Mazda conversion before, can be done nicely, can be butchered, it is in the
hands of the installers.

Or as RD suggested a blower, my thoughts drift toward a MR-2 supercharger, and
associated hardware.  Advantages, great bottom end, and you can turn the thing
on and off, due to its electric clutch, advantage if you get some really cheap
gas.  It also has an intake bypass for just such events.  Or a VW G60, but the
efficiency is not as good.  And then there is a Vortex unit out that has the
properties of a turbo, but with out the exhaust plumbing.

And if you are dreaming, there is always a 908 conversion, been done, 3 times
now that I am aware of, 2 factory and one aftermarket.  Hmmm, 340hp, and a red
line around 8500 RPM, with the lovely sound of a flat eight breathing thru a set
of mechanical injection stacks, now that is mechanical music, a symphony of
tappets, and pistons, almost angelic.  <G>  Ohh, lets not forget, the flat 12,
or 16s from 917 production, but then serious chassis improvements are needed for
these.  Does not hurt to dream.

The possibilities are endless, just remember the more exotic your conversion,
the more exotic the price.  My vote still goes for the flat - 6 if you are very
resourceful, it can be done relatively inexpensively.  But then I have done
allot of trading, bartering, and begging to get there, not exactly in that
order.  It all adds up, and each conversion has its own set of problems, just do
the research and you are along way ahead of the game.

>Small coincidence here with Joe Davis:

I have two 914 and a Vangon.
My Brit friend here in SoCalif has a Black Shadow and a Rapide.  
He's a bachelor, while I have the full catastrophe - 
    house, wife, kids..

As for power upgrade, there's probably almost nothing you can put into 
the 914 that will destroy handling.  However, I would study the 
installed weight and height of center-of-gravity of whatever you would 
install.  That will favor the pancake six.

For a more modest improvement, there is an electric turbo that will 
soon be on the market.  It's called Electro-dyne, and should do wonders 
for a stock 2.0.
