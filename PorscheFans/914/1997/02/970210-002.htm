To Brian (and all the other computer guru's who may be out there).

First of all, thanks for not using extreme profanity in your response, I
personally appreciate it   :-)  .

I am not a computer whiz, or extremely literate as to how this e-stuff works.

On the last 914 PorscheFans we had 59 posts which takes up over 50 pages of
print matter, if you were silly enough to print it all out.  23 of the posts
were for prospective vendors in Zone 1 Tech Tactics, and 24 were for Drivers Ed
at Mid Ohio.  Without those in the posting and the 5 other attendant queries
about the problem, we'd only have had 7 posts to read.  Instead we all gleefully
scrolled through this stuff we now have memorized.

Assumption has bad connotations to it, but I assumed that Mr. DRIVER ED - Ray
Calvo (local phone # 412.824.5264) and Mr. TECH TACTICS - George Beuselinck
(local phone # 201.266.2128) had automatically hit some "Repeat Send" button and
NEVER turned it off, since both of their posts are ADVERTISEMENTS.

Advertising, being what it is, can be annoying anyway, in the hands of obnoxious
marketers.  Now that may be an unfair assumption (that Calvo and Beuselinck are
TRYING to be annoying marketers) but that's the way it appears.  So, I treat
their little ad the same way I treat telemarketers, I have nothing to do with
them.

If the annoyance gets us upset enough, we go find some diabolical retaliation
like call them on the landline.  If that doesn't work, we begin a counter attack
against their known phone number (like repeat collect calls) and snail mail of
equal annoyance.  But, that's for the (10%) proactive in our society.  For the
rest of us (90%) we just sit around and carp about the annoyance.  We could
always unsubscribe for a while, if the activity of scanning through this mound
of e-spam is too time consuming, but that wouldn't be any fun, with no one to
carp at.

Brian and others, what is the REAL problem here, and what is the REAL fix?  Is
this a headache to the sysadmin, and he can't figure out what's going on?  Is
there anything we as subscribers can really do, besides be so ticked off and
occasionally write a letter of discontent?  After all, this is a free service to
us, and we don't want to see it screwed up.
