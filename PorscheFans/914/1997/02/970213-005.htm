Hi Jeff, Ken et. al.

As the author of the 320i-brakes-on-the-914-4 conversion TechTip, I'm happy
to see a rising number of people expressing interest and/or doing the
conversion, with good results. It's nice to see the work that went into it
appreciated.

Your "small tubing bender" will probably be OK. You may find it useful to
tape the "hole nuts" to the ends of the tubing before bending (assuming you
have a pre-assembled, straight line) so that you don't find the hole nuts
both on one side, and a bend in the middle ... aaargh! BTDT.

Just do the bends slowly, incrementally, checking your work as you go
along.  You should not _unbend_ a line once it's bent, so increase the
acuteness of the bend gradually (10-20 degrees at a time) and check the fit
each time.

Also, if you depress the pedal slightly (say 1-2 inches) and hold it in
place (I use a Club between the steering wheel and the brake pedal), you
may seal the system sufficiently to keep brake fluid loss at the open line
to a minimum.

Lastly, I get metric brake lines (and Metric Fasteners) from Global Metrics
in Belmont, CA. They may be useful if your FLAPS doesn't have any. Or, you
can buy from a BMW, Mercedes, Porsche dealer.

        Global Metrics, Inc.
        519-J Marine View Avenue
        Belmont, CA 94002
        415-592-2722
        800-227-9981

(I'm not associated with them, just a satisfied customer. They're nice people.)
