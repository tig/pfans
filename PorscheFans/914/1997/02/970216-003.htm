Hi 914-er's!

Thom Kuby asks:

"    also, on a related subject; can anyone explain to me just HOW 
CRITICAL the alignment of the caliper halves really is when 
re-assembling? (after changing out those little O rings?)? is the 
"eyeball" technique not good enough?   "

  I have only had experience with the rear calipers, but as the design 
is similar, I will go out on a limb, and say this.

  Alignment of the halves on re-assembly is no problem at all... each 
caliper is held together with four bolts, each of which is threaded only 
near the end.  For most of their length, they are unthreaded, and a 
close fit in their holes.  Hence, it is impossible to "mis-align" the 
caliper halves on re-assembly;  the only things that you have to worry 
about are the O-rings falling out at the last minute when they are 
impossible to see, and correctly re-torquing the caliper  half securing 
bolts in the correct order.
  As far as the O-rings go, I used a bit of silicone grease to hold them 
in place while assembling the two caliper halves, although I think that 
if one slipped, you would notice a funny fit before you tightened the 
bolts.  If you are assembling a caliper with a spacer between the 
halves, then you have twice as many O-rings to worry about; for the 
sake of ease of assembly and peace of mind, better grease 'em up.  
(I refer to silicone grease here; DO NOT use petroleum based 
grease!)

				Have Fun,
				Jim T.
