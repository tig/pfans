This probably should go to Josh (Crash Magnet) Hadler, because I think I
recall a very similar problem after his first parking lot attack: 

I suspect my '75 2.0 of throwing an electrical fit. The timing is
appropriate, because I am planning to sell this car to pay for the RS
America (I feel like a cheating husband).

Symptoms: 
1. The battery runs so flat in 3 or 4 days just sitting that the car
won't start. It charges and seems to hold a charge (for three days at
last test).

2. The handbrake warning/turn signal relay makes an odd buzzing (not
clicking) sound when the ignition is first turned on, but returns to
normal after the car has been started (this has bothered me for at least
6 months, but the car used to start).

Best guess: A chronic short in the "hot" wiring (key is off, remember?).

How do I go about testing for and isolating this fault, since it seems
to be before the fuse block? I've got a pretty good digital multimeter
that measures amperage up to 15 amps.

Any similar situations and solutions would also be appreciated.
If I can't trace the fault, I might have to keep the car ;-)).

Jeff in Yokohama
