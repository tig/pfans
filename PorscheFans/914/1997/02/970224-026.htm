While checking out the new car over weekend I pulled the plugs for first
time.  This is a newly rebuild engine (PO got just before selling car).  It
had Bosch W8DC plugs.  I'm use to the Type 1 engine, it has the short
threaded plugs, These W8DC plugs have a longer threaded end and I know if
plugs are too long they can cause hot spots from threads sticking into the
combustion chamber or even hit the piston.   Are these the normal length
for a 914?

Also, the plugs were gapped at about .038 rather than the stock .028,
right now this engine has 44 Webers and some kind of non stock cam, stock
coil and plug wires, .009 distributor.  I will be switching it back to full
2.0L FI system next month so not critical but what gap and what kind of
timing should this Weber/009 combination be set to?

 I recall the .009 has about 22 deg. of total advance.  Should this engine
still be set so it has the stock total advance 27deg BTDC at 3500 RPM?  Not
sure where it is currently, was going to check last night but was dark by
time I finished adjusting valves and checking plugs.  Tried checking but
was getting weird reading so want to check when have more time and light.
