Thank you Dan.  We paid a lot for those books about two years ago when the
original publisher went out of business.  We are always looking for sources
for new factory 914 parts and quality accessories.  Everyday, parts
supplies and sources dry up, and the fight to maintain any inventory
becomes increasingly impossible. The tooling to remake rare parts and the
quantities involved prohibit even our place from having them made:  Case in
point: 914 speaker grilles.  Most are broken by now and new ones are over
$100.00 if you order them from Porsche.  We investigated having them made
and the cheapest quote was from Taiwan at $15,000 tooling and $6.00 each
plus shipping, customs, and duty, with the minimum quantity 3000 of each
side! even with the 100+ 914 parts we do make we have over $250,000
invested in tooling and with some parts quantities in stock that we will
never sell in a lifetime-NOR recover our investment. The point is though
that we LOVE the 914 and want as many parts available as cheaply as
conducting a FOR PROFIT business can afford, and we LOVE competition. My
personal feeling when I call a supplier to order a part for my old vintage
restoration project is like yours: I don't care how much it costs OR costs
to ship-I am just glad that you have the part.  I do however want my part
as quickly as possible and as described. If it is not I have a legitimate
complaint.
     We had heard that a publisher in England bought the rights to publish
"Caught By Camera" but Ernst (the author) did not know who is was (back
then).  We would be very interested in you, Dan, supplying us this book in
the future when our supply gets low.  Please foward buying information.  We
will gladly pay $38.50 each for the books in some quantity.
   Our new 914 catalog is due out later this year and it will be the best
yet!  Everyone on our 914 list will be automatically mailed one, and we
know over 30,000 of you who love the cars enough to fix them up. Thanks for
all of the business over the years and continue to keep the 914 faith!
