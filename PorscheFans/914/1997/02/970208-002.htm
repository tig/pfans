But they don't demonstrate them under heat cycling conditions. That is
where the seats will fall out. Run the engine for a while and then
engine brake down to idle and jump back on the gas. This is a common
cause for dropped seats. The heating-cooling cycle _may_ loosen them.
I'm not saying that this will cause _your_ engine to drop a seat, but it
is a very common factor in droppped seats.
