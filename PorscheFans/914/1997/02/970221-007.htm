No need to say facetious, it's true.  The very first car to carry the 
Porsche name was a mid-engine racer with lots of stock VW parts.

The VW was conceived and designed by Dr. Porsche.  What committee 
designed the 924 and its "successors?"

That pretty well describes the BMW M-3, for sure.
The Miata was a damn good parody of the XKE.  Hate to say it, but the 
XK8 looks like a high-priced Miata.  But for performance, comfort and 
practicality, the Miata is a POS (lacking) compared to a good 914.
