Hi 914ers,

Brake proportioning is a wierd science.  The thing with proportioning
valves is that they are NOT there for adjusting brake balance, only a
dual-master-cylinder assembly can do that (or you could do it by changing
piston sizes..) 

What the valve does is it limits the pressure to the rear system under
certain conditions.

Under mild to moderate braking, just before the magical "cross-over" point,
the fronts and rears get the same pressure.  This is typically what happens
for mild stops, dry or wet.  In other words, MORE rear braking under
mild-moderate conditions.

Under heavy to extreme braking, the valve limits the pressure (actually
fluid volume) to the rear brakes, in PROPORTION to the fronts, preventing
rear wheel lock-up.  In other words, LESS rear braking under heavy-extreme
conditions.

If we were to graph the pressure to the brakes, the fronts would be a
straight line, or linear shape.  The rears would be a curve, similar to a
logrithmic (sp?) shape.

What we adjust when we play with the proportioning valve is the cross-over
point.  Don't ask me how to do that.  I haven't tried it yet.


just my 2kb,

Brian Ng
