Bore? I would still love to do it if I can find the money.

First off, this car will be a rear mounted engine not mid-mounted. The
VW water pumpers are transverse and angled back to get the engine behind
the drive axles. So driving teh rears instead of the front will give you
a rear weight bias. It would be better to try and get a gear box from a
formula car, and then get a Kenedy Engineering package to mount whatever
to the gear box. Then we'll be talking.

I'd go for the G-60 motor. A supercharged 4-banger would be a kick in
the pants in a light weight rear drive mod car!

Problem solved with an f-car LSD gearbox.

That goes without saying. We've all know that for years!
