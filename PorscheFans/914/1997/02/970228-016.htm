Just guessing  It is possible the valve adjuster screws are worn
erratically, you didn't mention changing those.  If the ends are worn you
can get adjustment variations depending on how you adjust them.  Weak valve
springs might also cause problems.  How big a variation over the .008 do
you get?

Subject:  Incredible Changing Valve Clearance




My '74 914 2.0 engine is displaying some baffling behavior! The #1 exhaust
valve clearance seems to change at random. It can be properly set, then the
car driven 20 miles, and after cool-down the clearance has changed. It
might now be non-existent, or way too wide! This follows a head rebuild in
which valve seats, guides, and the valves themselves were replaced. On
disassembly, all of these components appear to be working normally without
unusual looseness or binding.

We have a suspect, but won't know for sure until this part is replaced and
the engine is run again.

Anybody seen this problem before, or want to venture a guess as to what
might be the problem?

Thanks,
