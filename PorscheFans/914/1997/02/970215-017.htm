I do.  Mine's a commuter.  Cup washers held by sheet metal screws in 
critical spots work well to push the pad back up into place and hold it 
there.  You could spread some contact cement in there first, but it is 
unlikely to hold that heavy thing for long all by itself.

No, a cup washer is not like a dishwasher.  And it's not like a 4-40 
screw:  that's a quickie at 20 minutes to five.  Should I tell you 
about a split washer?
