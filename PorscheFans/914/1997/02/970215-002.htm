Yes, as long as you have good sailing skills. I remember having to tack
quite a bit in a strong cross-wind. I think I had about 35-40 degrees
off neutral on the steering wheel. Makes for very odd wear on the tires.
Straight ahead it does have a pretty good CD, and it also has a very low
CG. But in a cross-wind, you might as well have two masts and a tiller.
