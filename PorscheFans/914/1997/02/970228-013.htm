Dan, et al:

Not to beat a dead horse but... I'm glad to know that there are people who
understand the basic principles of business.  After reading the reply by
Don, my initial instinct was to add my two cents. After thought, I realized
that it was adding fuel to a worthless fire.  Now that  Dan has spoken up,
I would like to add my perspective from the other side.

As Dan knows that book is no longer in production.  The rights to the book
are also no longer owned by the author.  George tracked the author down and
told him that he had to have as many copies as he could get his hands on.
Mastenbroek  (author) didn't even have copies on hand so he called around
and was able to only able to come up with about forty.  The printing
company said that reprinting was highly unlikely.

In order to have this book for his customers, George bought all of these.
As a favor, he asked the author to personally sign each copy.  George paid
$38.50 for each book, plus the cost of shipping.  I can assure you that he
did not go to all of this trouble for the purpose of overcharging our
customers. The price is more than fair.

Automobile Atlanta's foundation was built on a premise of having EVERYTHING
for 914s and their owners!  This is just one example.  Take a look at the
numerous parts that are manufactured by AA because Porsche stopped making
them.  Did Porsche care that these parts were really needed by 914 owners?
Did George? Because of our partners/customers, AA has grown to a level that
we can provide as many of these parts as we can to keep the 914s on the
road. Decide for yourselves.
