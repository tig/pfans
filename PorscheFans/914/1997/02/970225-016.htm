	The white 'O' is indeed TDC.  The fan only goes one way on the fan
hub; there's a pin of some sort on one side that fits into a hole on one
side.  It might be possible to put the fan hub onto the crank with the wrong
orientation, but I don't think it is offhand.  Take a look at the Haynes
manual, or (if you have it) the Factory one.
	The red notch is the timing point for the stock set-up.  I don't
remember if that's 27 deg BTDC, but that sounds about right.
	If you put the distributor drive shaft in with a different orien-
tation from stock, you can still set the timing correctly using a timing
light.  Well, until part of the distributor hits the fan shroud (or other
stuff in that area).
	It sounds as if either the fan is incorrect (but I'm not sure it
can be, unless someone's messed with the fan itself) or your timing is just
very advanced.  I noticed, due to an error of my own, that the car will run
OK with the timing pretty well advanced out of spec.  It idles a lot higher,
but it runs OK.  I'm not sure that I noticed any pinging either, but this
was back when I was still running 92 Octane.
	You can try retarding the timing, but then you'll have to go through
setting the carbs up again, or at least re-setting the idle.  Or, if you
don't think it's pinging and you're going to put a stock system back on in
a little while, just leave it alone and drive it.

	Good luck!
