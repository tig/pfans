Yesterday you wrote, "Could someone help me get the address to Richard Ellis
PorscheFans web site.  I understand this is our vehicle to post pictures of our
cars and projects.  I would appreciate any help in getting Richard's page back
in my directory.
 Thanks!"

Here you go -

here's another neat one Bill Newlin turned me on to last week, check it out.
http://www.dgi.net/914/feature/newlin.html
(that'll obviously get you right into Bill's pic, and then you can scroll around
from there)

You'll obviously find the two pictures of my work-under-construction when you
get into Rich's page and look around.  Of course, you could just drive by my
house and see it too : - )  Speaking of which, I was looking for you at the swap
meet last Saturday.  I wasn't there too long, 9ish or so.  Long enough to buy
some paraphernalia, submit an article to Kevin Hardison for Slipstream, say "Hi"
to Jim Meyer and a few others, then I scooted (had some stuff to do with my wife
too).  Are you going to the New Member's meet this coming Saturday?  If so, I'll
look you up.
