Actually, if you look at the miata it's pretty obvious that it was
styled after the Lotus Elan. All I can say is that the Elan is a far
superior car, as long as you don't take maintenance into question. And,
in defence of the miata (doning asbestos underware), it is what all of
the great roadsters aspired for in the 60s without all of the
maintenance or excentric problems that the classis roadster suffers
from. Unfortunately for the mazda it was all those quirks that gave
these old roadsters life and character. The miata is about as soul-less
as a sports car can get. Yeah, it does everything flawlessly. It can
handle better than an old roadster. It has more power than an old
roadster. It doesn't leak oil, or burn fuses, or gnash gears like an old
roadster, but it doesn't inspire like an old roadster either. Given a
choice between a miata and a 914, I'd take the 914 any day. Now, given a
choice between the Elan and the 914... that's a toughie...
 
And personally, I think Porsche did a fine job with the Boxter. And it
looks alot better in person than on the page of a magazine.
