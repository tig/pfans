Greetings, 914-er's!

  I guess I'll put in my $.02 worth on this also.  I kind of like Dirk =
Wright's 
idea:  A 356 with a water-boxer in the back would be kind of nifty.  I =
am 
not sure where one could hide the radiator, but I'm sure someone could =



come up with something.  The 356 purists could be pacified by 
reminding them of the parts commonality benefits, although these would =

be minimal if one used all different suspension, etc.  Personally, just =
for 
nostalgia's sake, I'd like to see it compatable with the 356 (except for =

smog engine, of course) in all respects.  The only thing is... can you =
get 
swing-axels past the safety wardens?

  Re: Dave Darling's idea and Josh Hadler's comment about it:  I don't =

think that the engine lean is much of a problem.  Either put an extra 
gear in the gearbox (or take one out) to reverse the rotation, or put a =

different cam in the engine and spin it the other way.  Mid-engine 
makes a lot more sense to me if you are going to start from scratch.  
The only other thing that I would REALLY like to see, is a tubular 
space frame, or at least a tubular sub frame from the firewall back.  
That way, the whole rear end of the car could be made to pivot up and 
back, just like on a real race car, so that working on the thing would =
be 
more of a pleasure, instead of a chore.

					Regards,
					Jim T.
