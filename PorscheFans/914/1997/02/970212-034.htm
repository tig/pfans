  I agree with Don, check them all out.  Since several sales this week I've
  been making lists and comparing prices. My new toy needs lots of little
  thing, like almost all the rubber seals :-(


  Sales:
  Performance Products  they had 20% off till Feb 1st.  I got some things
  then I got card showing sale 20% of from Feb 3rd to the 14th (don't know
  if sale for everyone or just with card)  I didn't know about the PCA 15%,
  have to get off my butt and join.  I've been generally happy with the
  stuff I got from Perf. Products. They're close enough that I drive to the
  Van Nuys store.

  Automotion   20% till the 14th
  Tweaks has sale flyer good till 28th
  Stoddard had 10% off on the 11th

  I ordered some items from Stoddard yesterday.

  It pays to check everyone, I can't say one was always better than the
  other, I'm amazed at the wide difference in prices between them.
  Sometimes one is one third the price of another for the same item.

  Also have Auto Atlanta catalog I compared.  So far I'm ordering most of
  the stuff from Automotion, with the sale they were lower on most things.
  After hearing about GPR from Don I emailed them for a quote on a few
  items.  They were lower on most even with the sale prices of others.  I
  emailed almost my entire list ot them for a quote so probably GPR or
  Automotion will get a big order.

Hello All,

 Just a Reminder,
 There are a few sales going on right now , but still shop around.
  I missed the Stoddard sale yesterday (11th) because I forgot about the
time difference, oh well.
 I have had good service from Performance Products in the past so I
tried them again (after I called around). One thing I had forgoten was
that Preformance Prod's gives 15% discount and FREE shipping to PCA
members always, Thats a pretty good savings even without a sale !

 Don
 Got to go buy some more
 new parts before there
 all NLA ; )
