Clark questioned,

By rare coincidence, my '76 also has the same symptom, but seemingly 
intermittent.  The 'improved' switch on the '75-76 costs twice as much 
as the earlier switches that don't fail.

I have found that pushing in on the key while cranking makes the 
contact, so I haven't worried about fixing it.  

Rickydick's policy of Benign Neglect:

Who knows, the car may get rear-ended before the switch fails for good, 
and then I won't ever have to fix it.
