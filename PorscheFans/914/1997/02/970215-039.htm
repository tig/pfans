  Welll, only a small part of it....

  Owwww. Now my head hurts.  I did the math more or less right and 
STILL interpreted it incorrectly!!  Andy is (surprise!;-) correct.
You can tolerate MORE rear brake bias in the wet than in the dry.

   Sorry, Ken, keep on doing what your doing!

   In case anyone is still interested, the expression I derived last time
assumes that you have your brake bias optimally set.  Therefore, after I
looked at it more closely, it becomes an expression for what you WANT the
brake bias to be as a function of how slick it is.  If your front rotors 
generate a braking force F for a given pedal push, you want your rears to 
optimally generate a force:

  R = F*(a - u*h)/(b + u*h), where a=CG-to-front, b=CG-to-rear, h=CG height.
				   u=coefficent of friction.

 (Note that as u goes down, the optimal rear braking proportion goes up.)
