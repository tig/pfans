This is typical of people that want the false confidence of being able =
to categorize and judge things without going to the trouble of actually =
examining the merits of the item.

This has two dangerous effects. One is that it leads people to accept =
anything no matter how inbred or flawed as long as it is _purebred_. =
This is why many people have nervous dogs that crap all over themselves =
and have to go to therapy; England had an inbred monarchy leading to =
princes with huge ears; and American cars continued to sell well even =
during the years when their quality fell far below their foreign =
competition.

The other is that they automatically rule out new ideas, new =
innovations, and new contenders. People become unable to see merit in =
anything that does not easily fit their preconceived definion of good =
versus not good.

Is the VW-Porsche a bastardization? I find that hard to support since it =
combines Dr. Porsche's original 'car of the people' and later =
'performance with no compromise' concepts into developing a 'sports car =
for the people.' The 914 as the product of two branches of the same =
family working together to combine their talents into something greater =
than either could have produced alone.

It probably would have helped the 914 if PCNA had not tried to obscure =
the VW aspects in their North American marketing of the car. By trying =
to hide the VW aspects, they created the illusion of a guilty secret. =
They should have featured the combined heritage as a strength -- =
performance plus economy.
