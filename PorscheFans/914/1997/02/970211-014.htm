This message was forworded to me.

The phone companies are petitioning the FCC to impose a per-minute 
charge for internet use.  Guesstimates range from 4-5 cents per minute for the
large companies up to 40 cents for the smaller ones.  They contend that:  
internet usage has/will hinder operation of the telephone network.
The FCC has set up an email box for comments -- all replies must 
be in by Feb. 13.  The address is isp@fcc.gov.
>> 
You'll notice the public hasn't been told about this -- the 
Computer User's Group requested help in spreading the word so we'll have a
chance to express our opinions.
With the number of computers in the U.S, increasing daily, a 
monthly charge of $1 would provide a healthy amount.  Those prices are
outrageous!! And it would certainly bring to a screeching halt the current
spread of computer technology and commercial use to the general public.

 PLEASE FORWARD THIS MESSAGE TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW! AND SEND YOUR RESPONSES TO
THE FCC AT:   isp@fcc.gov.
