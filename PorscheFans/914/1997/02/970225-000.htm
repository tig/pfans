Greetings 914-er's!

  Jef Lorentzen asks:

"  While checking out the new car over weekend I pulled the plugs 
for first time......   It had Bosch W8DC plugs.  I'm use to the Type 1 
engine, it has the short threaded plugs, These W8DC plugs have a 
longer threaded end and I know if plugs are too long they can cause 
hot spots from threads sticking into the combustion chamber or even 
hit the piston.   Are these the normal length for a 914?   "

  I can't say about all 914's (someone else on the list want to jump 
in?) but my '74 2.0 litre has long-reach plugs.

"   Also, the plugs were gapped at about .038 rather than the stock 
..028, right now this engine has...... stock coil and plug wires, .009 
distributor...... what gap...... " 

  You don't say if the ignition system as a whole is still stock, or if it 
has some sort of electronic upgrade, but if conventional 
points-condensor, then I'd say .028".

"  and what kind of timing should this Weber/009 combination be set 
to?   I recall the .009 has about 22 deg. of total advance.  Should 
this engine still be set so it has the stock total advance 27deg BTDC 
at 3500 RPM?   "

  That's how I'd do it.  Anyone else care to comment?

				Jim T.
