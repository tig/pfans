Hi 914-er's!

  Many thanks to all who replied to my question about visual 
identification of fuel injectors.  The color coding info is a big help.

  I have also developed another way of identifying the injectors, 
although it takes good eyesight and/or a strong magnifying glass.  
Appreciation is also due to Automotion, from whose catalog I got the 
Porsche part numbers, which I was able to confirm by looking at my 
injectors.

  There are two part numbers on my injectors, one on each side of 
the square plastic housing that angles up to form the electrical 
connector.  On one side is the porsche part number, which agrees 
with the Automotion catalog, and on the other side, accompanied by 
a VW- in-a-circle logo, is the VW part number.  For my '74 2.0 litre 
engine (and according to Automotion, for '73  2.0 litre engines also), 
the numbers are as follows:

	Porsche #  0.280.150.019
	VW        #     039.906.034


  Perhaps they would be cheaper from a bug parts house, now that 
we know the VW part number.

				Thanks Again,
				Jim T.
