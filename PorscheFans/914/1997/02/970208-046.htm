Hello everyone.....More info on the 100,000 mile seat warranty.  Mark
Stephens has indeed been dong 914 "stuff" for a long time.  I first did
business with him at RTR in the 80's.  I have had very good luck with the
products (CW cranks & heads) he has provided and quality is also very good.
My experience with his headwork started in '93 with a simple fix for a
friends 1.8L head.  It's been several years and about 6 sets of 2.0L heads
and several repairs also.  I have had stock to monster valve sets installed
with porting, unshrouding, necking and all the fun 914 headwork I could
afford.  Again, the proof is in the fact that the heads have yet to fail.
 All the cars were street cars and all are still free of head problems.  I
live in the Dallas area and have tried several local shops.  Some are very
good but are not set up to economically do 914 heads.  Rare Morrison is local
but has a year waiting time and wants about $600.00 a head for a stock
rebuild. My opinion is MSHP (805-822-5678) are the best bang for the buck.
 If their quality stays they will be around for as long as they wish.  With
their "conditional" warranty and a good track record I can definately
recommend them to anyone in the group.
I also read the remanufactured 2.0L head article and think their efforts
shoud be applauded.  There are very few folks out there doing R&D work that
has the potential to effect the average 914er.  This head change could
possibly be one.  Keep your fingures crossed and dig out those 1.8L cores.
 They may soon be worth something!
