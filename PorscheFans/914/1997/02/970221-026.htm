Sorry to whomever I sent my post to (by reply).  I was trying to get out of
work on time and forgot to change the "To:" to the list.

Anyway, following the current wheel thread, does anyone have any suggestions
for "inexpensive" or at least "less expensive" 7x15 or 7x16 wheels for a 75 914?

Looking through the catalogs, it seems I will be paying close to $1000 a
set!  At that price, there are quite a few other upgrades that will have to
come first.

By the way, I plan to use wheels with the standard 225mm Porsche offset.  I
feel that modifying the rear fenders slightly is well worth the extra track
width gained -- as opposed to the 7 inch wheels with modified offset to fit
under stock fenders.

Thanks in advance,
Jeffrey Dunning
