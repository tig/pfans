I can add that the problems we have with our cars is partly due to thier 
"orphan" status with Porsche, and partly due to special needs and/or 
difficult (as in time consuming) maintianence. 

The jibe from 911 owners that our cars are "just volkswagens" and are
therefore disposable has meant that many people didn't keep up on repairs
and/or kludged them. This accounts for part of the reason for the
typically poor condition the cars are found in at purchase. 

The midengine location made engine work difficult, so it was also either 
kludged or ignored. Also, special needs like frequent transmission oil 
changes were normally ignored.

Finally, the bad design choice of battery location leads to very rusty 
cars. The other parts of the car probably don't rust any worse than a 911 
from back then.

I would guess that if the car was properly repaired, then it would be as 
reliable as a 911. The NLA status of the fuel injection wiring harness 
may be a problem, however. (I've only had my car a year, and I only drove 
it for a few months before I ripped it apart)

Also, I would answer the jibe about "it's just a volkswagon" by saying 
that there are more parts compatable with a Porsche 911 than with a 
VW 411/412. The fact that the steering, brakes, front suspension and 
transmission are either the same as or interchangeable with the 911 makes 
it more of Porsche to me than a VW. I think 411 compatability stops after 
the engine and the front calipers (and a few switches).
