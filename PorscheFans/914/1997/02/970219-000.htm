Greetings, 914-er's!

  Mike Lee asks:

"  Does anyone have any hints on how to remove the round 
side-marker  lights on the front fenders without destroying them 
(breaking off the retaining tabs)?  I'm 0 for 2 so far....  "

  I understand that Mike is simply going to do without, since he has 
fender flares that get in the way anyway, but having just had to re-work 
my right side marker light (Dave Darling's comments on body shops are 
seconded!), I may be able to be of some help.

  My side marker light was inoperative; an investigation showed that the 
body-shop types who had replaced the right front fender after an 
accident years ago had just slipped the wires through holes in the 
push-on tabs and folded them over.  Add to this no moisture exclusion 
boot, and... well, you get the idea.
  One thing that they did which may be a solution to the problem of 
remounting fixtures with broken tabs is to simply drill two holes through 
the fixture in unused places and secure the thing to the fender with 
sheet metal screws.  This appears to work OK, and is probably lots 
cheaper than a new light.

				Regards,
				Jim T.
