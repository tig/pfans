>Hi, I can't speak for the Stoddard adapters, however I will throw in my
..02 on the Alloy calipers.  It has been my experience, and that of many
others who I can reference, that these calipers exhibit an excessive amount
of flexing under hard braking such as in racing or track events.  My friend
a long time Porsche SCCA racer warned me but I bought them anyway.

After a half of a season they went into the swap meet bin, and I had a hard
time 
getting rid of them at that.  They flex giving the impression that the lines
aren't bled, or that the fluid is starting to boil, this also causes the pads
to wear
at an angle.    You would never notice this on the street probably, but 
I would bet you will find flex on the track.  <

Yes this is a know problem with the "S" caliper.  But I look at it this way, the
sets I have used, the flex was miniumal, the SC caliper that replaced the S is
cast iron, or other heavy metal.  I live with the flex to save some unsprung
weight.  Also they are great to buy because people aviod them, because of the
above problems. Or maybe I just have a good set of "S" calipers, who knows.

HMM, I wonder if the Boxster monoblock calipers will bolt on, anybody want to
give a set up in the benifit of 914 science.  I am more than willing to conduct
the testing, have a G-anaylist so we can be scientific.  I wold also need a
donated set of tires, and several rotors, and brake pads, but it sounds like a
day of FUN.
