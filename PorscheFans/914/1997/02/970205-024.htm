<< Then I cleaned and degreased the glass and the caulk area 
 on the car. I ran a thick beadof clear RTV around the frame, and placed 
 the window in there. Then I ran another beadaround the edge of the glass 
 (it's real messy), and squished it into the recesses with my fingers 
 (like caulking a house). Also, I ran another bead across the outside 
 bottom edge, making sure all voids were filled. Finally, inspect the seal 
 closely for voids and attempt to fill them. Let stand for a day or so, 
 then go over the entire window with a razor scraper and solvent to get 
 the window clean.  >>

This probably will work, but boy does this sound like the hard way!  Go to
your nearest autoparts store and buy a roll of 3M Window weld.  It is a
continuous roll of round window bonding material specially made for this job;
it bonds and "caulks" in one step.  You just have to make sure the glass and
the pinch weld in the body is clean.  This is what the factory recommends in
the supplement to the shop manual.  No messy silcone or cleanu to worry
about.  This is the same stuff you use to replace windshields.
