Hi 914-er's!

  I have been somewhat sucessful in locating this kind of noise using a
mechanic's stethoscope.  These are usually available from your FLAPS.  They
often have a probe which drives a diaphram in the sensing end that allows
one to exclude sound propagated through the air and concentrate on sound
generated in the area being probed.
  The procedure is as follows:    Support the car on jackstands.  Have an
assistant start the car, engage  5th gear and ease out the clutch at idle.
  Approach the car from BEHIND and INSIDE the track, so that if it pops off
the jack stands, it will simply drive away from you.  Be sure that your
head stays well clear of any part of the car that is low enough to contact
it when the car is on the ground.  SAFETY FIRST!  (Unfortunately, this
technique is somewhat dangerous under the best of circumstances; all
disclaimers apply!)
  Place the stethoscope probe on the trailing arm near the bearing, on the
gearbox, and any other place that you can get contact with non-rotating
parts.  Compare the good side with the bad side.  It should be possible to
isolate the noise source in this way.  It may be necessary to block one
wheel or the other so that you can get the desired one to spin.

  Incidentally, I am using Microsoft Mail version 3 for this message.  In
spite of what the help file says, there is no place that I can discover to
force hard carriage returns at the end of 72 characters.  When I had my
version 2.1 program configured this way, I got several complaints that my
messages were all on one line, and a great inconvenience to read.  Please
advise if this message has reverted to that problem, and I will go back to
using version 2.1.

						Thanks,
						Jim T.
