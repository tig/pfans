Brian:

Thanks for your response to the turbo question (via Don). I've talked with
Martin Schneider at MSDesignSystems. He, unfortunately, suggested only that he
did not have much time these days to deal with or talk about 914 turbo projects.
I learned of his "monster" 914 in a EURO-Car article and quickly contacted him.
He seems to be more interested in selling conversion parts and perhaps I caught
him at the wrong time.

I'm looking for about 400 low-midrange horses which can be harnesed within the
limits of a 916 LSD gearbox. I don't want to cut any original sheet metal and I
don't want the exterior of the car to suggest anything other than a GT. My
objective other than surprising unsuspecting 930's on my daily commute up & down
I-5, is to get past the Cal smog inspection. A turbo motor should not be a major
problem as it would have all the correct emmisions hardware and be of a later
year than the chassis. 

I'm getting so many negative responses to the turbo idea that I'm starting to
become resigned to a 3.8 with 46IDA's, mild cam upgrade and stainless exhaust.
When it comes to a 3.6 or 3.8; I believe it is possible to generally make it
look much like a 2.0 - 2.2 carburated car. This would include original fan
shroud, aircleaner box, heater ducting. Twin ignition  could be explained away
as an emmisions improvement, while a late a serial number on the case would be
attributable to replacement of old and weary mag cases that were beyond
remachining limits. The problem with the 3.8 idea is that I'm effectively
limited to about 300 - 340 hp. 

What do you know about the other turbo 914s Martin has put together?

v/r, 

Gordon Nesbitt
