Well...

	I think between Dave Darling and myself we could have built our own 914
FROM SCRATCH. 

	But in all honesty, I think the 914 is a rewarding car but as far as
reliability is concerned... The 914 is now about 25 years old and if
your 914 hasn't recieved any major repairs in the last 10 years or so,
expect to encounter some soon. The 914, in good working order, is an
incredibly simply car, mechanically speaking. And as such can be very
reliable if periodic maintenance isn't ignored. But most of these cars
that are on the road are now (or recently have been) suffering major
failures related to their age. Transmissions, suspensions, CVs, engines,
and other asstd systems will eventually fail due to age, use and abuse.
As these components get replaced and the 914 gets rejuvinated, it will
be a great car and will require minimal maintenance to keep it running
for another 20 years (unless the eco-patrol shuts us down). 

	Do I like my 914? No. I LOVE IT! I will never willingly part with it.
And I have had to fight and work hard to keep it some times. Who should
buy a 914? That depends on what you want. Are you looking for an
affordable, rewarding sports car that is steeped in german racing
history. A car that will put a smile on your face every time you see
that "twisty road next 19 miles" sign. A car that will keep your fingers
dirty and your knuckles scraped in an effort to get that twisty road
smile again. Then get a 914. If you're looking for an appliance that
will get you where you want to go and can be ignored for a year or more,
then get a Honda. I don't plan to give up my 914. 
	I did buy another car recently, but only because I moved to a climate
that is fairly inhospitable to the 914. It's still a VW-hybrid, I got a
VW Quantum Syncro. Picture a stretched VW GTI with an audi quattro
drivetrain and engine. It handles really well, especially in a foot of
snow or a slush and mud slimed dirt mountain road. But come spring time,
my 914 will be carving up canyon roads and autox courses with aplomb and
a big ear-to-ear grin on my face! :)

	Is it reliable? Hmm, well I elected not to drive it from California to
Colorado in the middle of the winter. Make whatever you will of that.
But I'd never trade it in. 

	The value of the 914? Now's the time to buy if you want to make an
invenstment in restoring a car. I think in about 10 years or so, the
value of the 914 will start on an upward trend. Most cars will hit a
value slump between 20 and 30 years. If the car maintains a loyal
following (namely folks like us), and are not butchered into parts cars,
the remaining 914s out there wil only gain in value.
