Everything you ever wanted to know about Porsche Part numbers:  1950-1975

I recently attended the Porsche Literature & Memoriability Swapmeet in Los
Angeles
and acquired a "pile" of interesting Porsche factory/distributor material, a
lot of which deals with various aspects of 914's. Included is this pile was
a collection of related memos from (at that time) Porsche/Audi related to
"Porsche Part Numbers". This is the most extensive explanation with examples
of the Porsche parts numbering system, original and modified, that I have
ever seen. The following are nine separate items (internal memos referenced
as catalogs No. 1 through No. 8) which cover every aspect of the Porsche
parts numbering system:

1. Catalog No. 1 (3 pgs), dated 8/68, titled:  The Porsche Part Number - a
written
description of the Porsche part numbering system detailing what each diget
stands for...
.....this is a code virtually describing the part.

2. Catalog No. 2 (1 page), dated 8/68, titled:  How to write a part number -
a written
description with examples of the process of coding Porsche part numbers.

3. Catalog No. 2A (11 pages), dated 1/25/71, titled:  Porsche Part Numbers -
everything
you ever wanted to know about Porsche part numbers.......the "old" numbering
system,
standard parts numbers, tool numbers, repair kit numbers, paint numbers,
accessory
numbers; the "new" numbering system-same breakdown, VW parts interchangeability.

4. Catalog No. 3 (2 pgs), dated 1/71, titled: Prefixes - Explains various
prefixes
to parts/project numbers from 356 to 917.

5. Catalog No. 4 (1 pg), dated 8/68, titled:  Parts Department - Part number
breakdowns by subgroups, Engine, body, etc.

6. Catalog No. 5 (3 pgs), dated 1/71, titled:   Main Group for 11 Diget Part
Numbers
and Sub Groups - part number breakdows by subgroups for "new" 11 diget part
numbers.

7. Catalog No. 6 (1 pg), dated 8/68, untitled - The following part number
and figure
indicates the type of body, 356ABC,Carrera, GT, Cabrio, HT, HT61, Speedster,
Conv. D, Roadster, HT Reutter, etc.

8. Catalog No. 7 (3 pgs), dated 8/68, titled: Preface - Additional
explanation of the
11 digit part numbering system for parts ordering.

9. Catalog No. 8 (3 pgs), dated 1/71, titled:  Parts Catalogs (Standard
Models) -
lists all Porsche parts books, supplements, etc published for 356-911-914 models
through 1971.

This is really interesting stuff!! I'd like to make it available to anyone
on the
list who's interested. I will make a bunch of copies of this complete set of
"catalogs" (don't let this description fool you, they're really 1-11 page memo
like documents) and send them postage paid to anyone who's interested for
$7. This
will cover copy costs, emvelopes, mailing, etc. and leave me with a couple
bucks to 
go out and buy more stuff!

More interesting stuff to come...............!!!!!!!
