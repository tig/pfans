Greetings P-nuts,

RE: using early 911 calipers on 914s...(WITHOUT changing over to five-lug
configurations)

ok...
I think it was Jeff Brubaker who mentions (see clipping below) using these
early M calipers as a cheap, bolt-on upgrade...
well, the words "cheap" and "bolt-on" always get my attention, hence my
question:

I have two pairs of what I THINK are these calipers Jeff is talking about,
in the garage now...
How do you identify them?
They say "ATE" on one side, and yes they sorta look like the 914 units, and
both pairs have the spacers installed (vented rotor configuration?)

also, on a related subject; can anyone explain to me just HOW CRITICAL the
alignment of the caliper halves really is when re-assembling? (after
changing out those little O rings?)? is the "eyeball" technique not good
enough?

I'd like to hear more about all of this...
Any thoughts?

Cheers
Thom Kuby
