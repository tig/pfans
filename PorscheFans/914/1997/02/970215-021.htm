The 320i calipers work great and the matching hard line is easy to make.
They are available anywhere for 150.00 each brand new.  The so called "M"
911t caliper also fits and sells for 200.00 each new, and again are
available anywhere for that price. Both will easily fit 70-early 72 914s
and with slight machining fit the late72-76 914s  The benefit of the BMW
caliper over the Porsche caliper is that the pad is the size of the 911S
and is much more effective
