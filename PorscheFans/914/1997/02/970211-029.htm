For dave Cooley and other interested parties:

Hi Dave!

  You wrote:  

"   I would expect that your injectors simply didn't like those
hot solvents for an extended period and gummed
things up by dissolving parts of the injectors themselves.....snip....
The parallel I see, is that certain parts of the injectors were
meant to be exposed to solvents, and others were not.....snip....  
I never believed that soaking would really get the solvent
to where it was needed.    I would find a way to pressurize
to 36 psi, and then  pump solvent only  through the fuel
circuit.    "

   It seems that my original posting wasn't as clear as I thought.  
Therefore, instead of replying to Dave directly, I will post this to the 
mailing list, in the hope that it will correct any missunderstandings that 
I have created.  
   The actual cleaning technique that I used did not involve soaking 
the injectors, for precisely the reason that you state:  I was afraid to 
get carb cleaner on the solenoid housing, or other parts of the 
injector that were not intended to handle continuous exposure to 
fuel, and I did wish to clean the fuel path along it's whole length.

  The carb cleaner that I used came in a spray can, and what I did 
was to energize the injector, and then place the spray nozzle of the 
can right up against the hose barb on the injector and spray cleaner 
through the injector in the same manner as fuel would travel.
  I operated the injectors only for brief periods, only long enough to 
observe a conical spray pattern come out the tip, and then power off. 
 I did this two or three times, and then put the injectors in a plastic 
bag and dumped them in with all the other miscellaneous parts in a 
big bucket, awaiting the appropriate time in engine re-assembly when 
they would be needed.

  It has been suggested that I should have either flushed them out 
with gasoline or solvent, or perhaps air-dried them with compressed 
air, or both (with power applied to allow penetration of the air / 
solvent through the whole injector).  Perhaps, if I had done this, I 
might have been all right, but I do not KNOW that this would alleviate 
the problem, and so I felt that the best thing to do is warn others 
away from the stuff (spray carb cleaner) altogether.

  One thing seems clear:  the parts that failed are INSIDE the injector, 
IN THE NORMAL FUEL PATH.  This means that merely avoiding 
exposure of the outside of the injector to solvents will not prevent  
destruction of the injector.

   I hope that this clarifies what I have been trying to say.

				Regards,
				Jim T.
