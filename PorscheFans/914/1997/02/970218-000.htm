I'd be nervous about connecting this up directly without a catch tank in
between: I do know that there's a lot of oil being slung around in
there. 
[How?  A friend of mine rebuilt his 915, installed the vent pointed the
wrong way, and lost all the transmission fluid at the track, toasting
his new bearings! :0) ]

I know it's improbable unless you screw it up yourself, but I'd hate to
think of that fluid ending up in the cylinders!
