I had a similar situation last fall. AA's Tech Tips talks about trying to
go through the access openings from the engine compartment with an
extention and 10mm socket to remove the trunk latch. I decided that was
next to impossible - in your case with a trunk full of stuff it is
impossible.

I ended up drilling out the lock. I was able to purchase a lock assembly at
my local salvage yard for $25 (a deal!) and then I rekeyed it. I have
rekeyed several locks successfully using the existing little parts. Seems
like they all have the same (or close to it) parts used in differing
sequences, so all you have to do is carefully develop the codes f(they are
numbered 1 through 4) from your key and then match the parts' sequence
accordingly. This is hard to explain but if you take one apart it will
become clear.
