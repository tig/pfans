  I just read that at the newsstand the other day.  The company is Mark
  Stephens something, they always advertise in Hot VW magazine, don't have
  an issue handy so don't recall full name or phone #.  Located in
  Tehacapi, CA

  They specialize in T4 engines.  Suppose to have a good reputation though
  I haven't dealt with them yet.  Suppose to have figured out how to do the
  valve seats right so no drop outs. That's why they will warranty them for
  any use.

  The article I saw was about their new 2.0L 914 type heads.  Since even
  good cores are getting scarce according to them, they have come up with a
  process to turn 1.8L heads into the 914 2.0L type.  They make it the 3
  bolt intake mount, change the plug angle and increase the valve sizes to
  match 2.0L (I think they used the 1.8L head since one of the valves
  matches within 1mm of the 2.0L valve). Do their valve seat thing.
  Suppose to cost about $550 outright each. Last I saw new bare 2.0L heads
  were like $800.

  The Hot VW ads, and an article in Hot VW I saw once listed their T4
  engine mods available also, suppose to have several variations on T4,
  close to stock, large bore, stroked, etc.  The ad indicates 914 stuff
  also.

  Don't work for them, haven't dealt directly yet, just heard good things
  and will consider when I need heads or engine parts.

  New Text Item:  Text Item

I received E-Mail from a friend of mine with some potentially good news.
 He said that the new European Car has an article about a company that
replaces the valve seats on our motors with Tungsten valve seats.
They're so confident of its reliability that they offer a 100,000 / 5
year warranty, regardless of what the car is used for!  Not only that,
but it's rumored that it's not too expensive, either.  I'm going to rush
out and buy the issue on my lunch break, so I'll post more details then.
