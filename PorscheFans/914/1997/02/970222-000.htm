Hi 914-er's!

  Clark Brown asks (about the ignition switch):

"    So, how do you get to that part (easily)?     "

  I have never worked on the ignition switch area, so I can offer no 
practical advice, but I will throw this out for it's humorous content (if 
any).

  Clarance L. (Kelly) Johnson, who headed the team that designed 
and built the SR-71 "Blackbird"  spy plane was interviewed for a 
documentary about the aircraft.  He was telling about all the things 
that they had to do to make the plane a reality... they even had to 
design their own hydraulic oil, because normal aircraft hydraulic oil 
couldn't take the temperatures encountered by the SR-71, and on 
and on.
  Johnson stated that at one point, when they were building 
prototypes, he posted  $50  on the bulletin board.... this was the prize 
for anyone who could come up with some task involved with the 
plane that was easy to do.  He then remarked: "I've still got the $50."

  I don't think that the SR-71 people have it any worse than us 914 
owners.
