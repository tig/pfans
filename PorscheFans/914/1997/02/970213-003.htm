>I'm thinking of going with a vented rear rotor on my 914/6 instead of the
solid type.  In doing this I am told that all I need to do is insert a 911
caliper spacer inbetween the caliper halves.  Is this upgrade worthwhile ?
 Do I need to get any parts ( o-rings) to reseal the caliper once the spacer
is in ?    Then.... I think I want Cool Carbon pads.<

Yes, but it depends on the rotor, UPFIXing did an article on it.  And I am in
the process of doing the conversion.  You will need the caliper spacers, O-rings
( caliper seals between halfs 911 P/N) and new bolts also a 911 P/N, the where
used on early 911S.  You can also use that rotor (911S) which is vented, but you
will need an approx... 1/8" spacer for the back side, the hat is to deep.  Or if
you can find the a 916 rear rotor grab it, no spacer needed.  Another caliper
option is that from a Ferriri 308, same exact design (parkig brake and all),
bigger pistons, can be found for $100 apiece used, and are setup for vented
rotors.  Don't think NAPA carries this one.  Disadavatages, bleed screw ends up
on the bottom, and they use the same size pad.  The bleed screw, is the tuff
one, but a good machine shop can mill, reem, drill, tap the new bleed screw
location in the proper upright position, then the calipers need rebuilt.

I have had an extra set of the caliper and rotor spacers milled for my car, it
was not a hard job.  I also have a couple of sets of 308 calipers handy, so I am
trying to decide which to use.
                                                OR
>The one other option that would be really great    is to get  front 911 S
alloy calipers and install using the caliper adaptors from Stoddard (
SIC.351.911.00 with only slight modification to original struts )  Has anyone
tried this adaptor ?  Then do the above rear upgrade and Cool Carbons all the
way around.<

Change the whole strut to an "S" or SC strut.  I have never used the adapter
plate, it will probally work well, but I perfer the whole strut.  Then you could
store the 914-6 strut - 911T strut, or sell it to a 914-4 person looking for an
PCA Auto-x legal brake upgrade in stock class.  BTW, the 320i caliper will boot
you to I1 for that modification.

>This probably would really screw me up   class wise   at Porsche Club auto-xs
?
But would be terrific at the Track Schools.<

Depends on the class you run.  If you are in stock class, welcome to I3, with no
other changes.  If you are already in I3 "improved 3" then you may be able to
stay, if you have not maxed the point progressions.  Yes, I3 is not a bad place
to be, but if I was you I would maximize my pionts for what ever class I ran.
This mod, falls under brakes outside production model.  Production model is All
914-4 and 914-6, no "GT" or 916 parts allowed in stock class.

And yes braking will be improved for track, but also street, and the "S"
calipers may help a bit in the Auto-x.
