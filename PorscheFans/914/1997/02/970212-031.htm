I keep forgetting to relate my experiences with the BMW conversion. I have
had mine on the car for about a month now and I'm very happy with the
result. I can skid the front wheels at 40-50 mph (that with 195/60x15 Yoko
509's).

I picked up the BMW calipers at my local junk yard (cost $40 for the pair)
thinking that I would rebuild them. I decided against that when I found
that NAPA had rebuilt calipers including pads for about $43 each (part
number in web article is correct). Cost so far $86 plus $40. I took the
great instructions from the web article to my machinist and he did the
milling for $60. I bought 8 inch steel lines and a tubing bender (bender is
needed because the bend is pretty acute).

Installing was easy except for the line bending. If you work quickly, you
don't even lose much brake fluid making bleeding easy too.

My car has an aftermarket brake proportioning valve which is adjustable.
Right now I have it completely "in" meaning maximum rear brakes. The rears
don't lock. I think I'll have to rebuild them to get more stop from them.
Then I'll have to readjust the proportioning valve.

I feel MUCH safer than before because the car really stops well. I'd
recommend it to anyone who feels comfortable working on brakes. The cost is
minor compared to the result. My total cost was under $220.
