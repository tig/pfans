Hmm, sounds like a MR2 or X1/9 to me. It sounds like a VW sports car,
maybe a replacement for the GTI? VW parts aren't very compatable with 
Porsche parts these days, as I understand it.

I thought that a flat 4 rear engined car would be more in line with the
Porsche tradition, since the Boxster relies at least partially on the
550/RSK cars of the 50's and 60's. Also, a flat 4 is light (especially the
Subaru version), so the weight distribution would suffer less, and it is
inexpensive. So, I thought that a "revived 356" would be a natural
progression from the Boxster, to continue the Porsche nostalga trip. I
find it interesting to contemplate the upgrade possibilities for the 356,
like 911-type suspension, steering, brakes, and transmisison, and Subaru
flat 4 hanging out back, and I dont' even own one. 

Of course, if I did, I would probably want it to be bone stock,
considering the way I do most things! On the other hand, I'm not even a
blip on the Porsche marketing department radar screen, since my financial
flight path is well below thier horizon, so an "econo-Porsche" is not
likely to take flight anytime soon. Even so, the 356 seems ripe for a
revival and integration into the styling of maybe a future Porsche. The
356 may be too sancro-sanct for that treatment, however. Owners of the
classic car may howl when they get a whiff of such a plan, and kill it.
