	Hey, the replies work the RIGHT way.

About loss of power:  I have had experience drivung on three cylinders.
(dropped plug into cooling shroud, wire falling off of plug, plug blowing
out of head (retained by wire, no thread damage))
Anyway, In each case there was no shaking, only loss of power.  And you
do loose lots of power.  Feels like there is only one cylinder left, not
just one missing.
	The only time there was violent shaking was when the coil
worked its way loose and was ingested by the fan.  Not good for the coil
or the fan.  My first thoughts were a flat tire too.
