Hey, everyone I just pulled this from the 356/912 Engine list, just
thought the interest was high enough to pass the info along.

Hi Bryan!

1) I've had good luck at rebuilding trannies.  The haynes manual helped a
  
lot.  Just make sure to string the gears and shims on a piece of wire as 
 
you take them off.  That way you can put them back on in the right order!

The 901 tranny is cheap to rebuild.  In general all you usually need are 
 
syncro rings, gasgets and maybe bearings.  I've never needed to replace  

gears or hubs etc.  One important point, when putting new intermediate   
plate gasgets in measure the old ones, and add two thousandsth for   
squish.  This will keep your pinion meshing depth right.

2) I'm not sure what trannies came with them but you can buy a taller 5th
  
to put in.  I bumped a 4sp X gear up to a Z.  This gave me a 135mph top  

end instead of the 118 mph stock.  Your 5spd probably has a Z 5th already
  
as the 5spds have a low ring and pinion ratio.  After Z I think comes ZZ 
 
then ZY then ZX, something like that, I don't have me book with me to   
look it up.

3) The noise is probably not tranny because they usually make noise when 
 
off or on power.  Here is a list of noises list that I have encountered:

Howl in 1st getting quieter in 2nd 3rd etc -  Intermediate plate bearings
Howl in 5th getting quieter in 4th 3rd etc - Pinion Bearing
Howl in gear neutral throttle at higher speeds - pinion meshing depth.
Noises that change with speed - CV's or differential bearings

4) The wires are supposed to be able to come out of the holes.  Check it 
 
with an ohm meter.  It should be ok.

5) You do not need to touch the engine or tranny to change any of the   
shift bushings.

Have fun at it!
