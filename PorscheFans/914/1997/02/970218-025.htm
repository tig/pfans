A very, _very_ difficult thing to do in CA nowadays.

Sorry, but inspectors in California aren't as dumb as we would hope them
to be. And unfortunately, they are very strict. Simply a single
miss-connected hose may get you failed at most stations. And I doubt
you'd be able to get a 3.6 or 3.8 to look like a 2.0 or 2.2. And why
would you carb it when you've got a great FI to begin with. The will
look at the engine numbers and determine its vintage most likely, and
then the engine'll fail because it's indiction has been modified
significantly.

Sorry, they won't buy it. They will fail anything, ANYTHING that is not
_stock_ for the model being tested. And if you're trying to pass a 3.6
as a 2.2 motor plan to get failed for illegal modifications.

They won't buy that either. Best case scenario, they'll fail you and
send you to a referee station. And those are a real pain.

However, if you do a complete transplant with _all_ of the original
emissions equipment intact (including catalytic converter) turbo or
otherwise, then you can have the car tested as a 911 with serious body
work modifications. _That_ they won't care about. Their criteria on
transplants are whichever is NEWER, the engine or the chassis. Whatever
has the more stringent limits smog wise.

That's a hell of a lot of power right there considering that your car
will weigh alot less than those 930's you want to dust. And the idea of
a GT flared 914 being stealth anything is silly. Anyone who looks at a
car whose flares almost double the width of the car, is going to expect
it to go mighty fast.
 
> What do you know about the other turbo 914s Martin has put together?

Not much besides the fact that they've been doing it since the 70's. So
I'd say they have a pretty good handle on what's going on.
