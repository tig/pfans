Greetings to the 914 list:

  I would wish that others might profit from my screw-up.  I am not 
absolutely certain of the failure mechanism, but I have now had my 
third fuel injector failure in the span of a week, and it looks as though I 
will be replacing all four.
  As near as I can tell, this is because of a cleaning technique that 
I employed some time ago. The technique was as follows:

  I operated the injectors on the bench using a bench power supply, 
and while operated (valve electrically held open with application of 
D.C.), I sprayed Gumout carburettor cleaner through the injectors.  
They were observed to operate normally at this time, including normal 
on-off valve action, and good spray cones resulting as the carburettor 
cleaner was sprayed through them.  No attempt was made to flush the 
injectors with anything after this procedure, and they were put away 
wet.  
  Some months later, upon trying to fire up the car, I had two injectors 
fail, which were replaced with two new ones.  Between shipping delays 
and work, the next opportunity to change the injectors and try again 
was approximately a week following the first time.  Upon starting the 
car, it was discovered that one of the previously working injectors had 
also failed, in like manner as the first two.  
  The failure mode is that there is no characteristic "rattle" when power 
is applied, and the injector valve mechanism is stuck.  The stick point 
may be either entirely closed (no fuel flow) or partially closed 
(considerable leakage, but not full flow).  The conjectured failure 
mechanism is chemical damage to internal plastic parts (possibly valve 
seat?) by the carburettor cleaner.
  This has turned into a $280. "oops", allowing for an average market 
price of $70. per injector.
  I have since consulted with a friend who owns an airplane, and he 
tells me that the ONLY thing that is permitted for use as a cleaning 
solvent on aircraft fuel injectors is 90+% isopropyl alcohol.  

  Therefore, my conclusion must be:  DON'T clean your fuel injectors 
using ANY of the popular carburettor cleaners that come in spray cans! 
 USE NO EXTREME SOLVENTS WHATSOEVER!!  The aircraft 
injectors mentioned above are mechanical types, not electronic as 
used in the 914, therefore I am not even sure that alcohol is safe for 
our use.  The only thing that we know for sure that is safe to introduce 
into the injector is fuel; therefore, I would recommend that ONLY 
CLEAN FUEL be used as an injector cleaning solvent.

				Good Luck,
				Jim T.
