	In all the other discussion about wheels, it looks like the original
question got ignored.
	For inexpensive 7" wheels, find some cheap steelies.  Then have
someone weld a 7" rim onto them.  I know a couple of people who have done
that--it's much less expensive than buying 7" alloys.
	I do not think that the wheels were cut radially and a new section
welded in, I think that the center section was cut out and welded onto a
new wider rim section.
	Remember--wheels are important.  Your most important pieces of
safety equipment--brakes and steering--do not work well if your wheels fail.
Make sure that anyone who messes with your wheels knows what they're doing.
