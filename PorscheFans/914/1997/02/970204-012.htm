May not have anything to do with your problem, but just as an FYI:  don't 
forget that the brake system failure switch on the master cylinder also uses 
the same relay.  I spent several evenings trying to figure out why my relay 
ticked all the time (not as loud as when the brake or blinkers were on, but 
could still be heard).  I replaced the relay, checked the E-brake switch, 
etc., etc. - finally gave up and decided to live with it.  A year later, I 
replace my master cylinder with a new 19mm and the ticking problem 
disappeared!  I then checked the switch on the original cylinder and lo and 
behold, it was creating enough of a ground to cause the relay to tick 
lightly (you electrical geniuses out there could probably explain it 
properly).  Just thought I'd share this with everyone.
