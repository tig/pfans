	Yes, the vent would be blocked by that.  It's sort of a bolt
with a really TALL head that has a hole in one side.  So you'd have
to (perhaps) have the bolt machined for a vacc hose fitting.  It'd be
a small fitting, don't know what effect a small hose would have on
the breathing.
	Don't forget the orientation--The hole is supposed to point
something like 60 degrees right of forward.  Haynes has a picture.
	The oil catch thing sounds like a good idea, too.  Maybe some
way for it to drain back into the tranny?  Hmm, we're getting pretty
expensive now.  Maybe you should just change the fluid every 10K mi
or year (whichever comes first).
