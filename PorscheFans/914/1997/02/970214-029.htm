<< What's the "right" 911 caliper for the 914 conversion?
 
 The article focuses on 320i calipers, Andrew had some
 trouble getting the pads to work right, and I want to
 avoid that.
 
 ATE part number, or "from a '73 911T" or something like
 that is what I'm looking for.  (Or the calipers themselves,
 actually.)
 
 (Not wanting to pay George's $800 price....)

Hi Gary, here's some alternatives for you to consider.  I believe this would
be a cheaper way to go and has essentially the same outcome.  Firstly,
I'm assuming you are planning to utilize the stock 914-4 front struts, 
otherwise I guess you wouldn't be looking into the 320i calipers.

The early 911 "M" type calipers will fit and are cheap & readily available
because 
so many 911 owners have gone to bigger brakes.  There are two ways 
of approaching this:

1) use the "real early" 911 "M" calipers from a 1965-69 911 which had
non-vented rotors.  A bolt on alternative.  The "M" calipers are essentially
the same as your 914 front calipers but they have larger pistons, and will
therefore improve your braking when utilized with a 19mm master cyl.
PN 901.351.975.00 left caliper
PN 901.351.976.00 right caliper
These are often hard to find so thus option #2

2) use the 911 "M" calipers from a 1967-75 911 which had vented rotors.
Because they are for vented rotors they are too wide for 914 solid rotors, so
to use these you will need to take the two caliper halves apart, remove the
center spacer, and re-assemble them using the shorter caliper bolts from
either a donor or you old 914 front caliper.  You should replace those little
fluid channel o-rings whenever you separate the halves. 
PN 901.351.907.00 left caliper
PN 901.351.908.00 right caliper

This was an old Auto-x trick to get away with something in the stock
class because they look essentially just like the stock brakes.

I don't remember, you may have to put 2 washers in between the caliper
and strut to gain optimum spacing to center the caliper over the rotor??
Just try a test fit without pads to verify everything looks good.

Obviously if you want to go to 911 front struts you will have a variety of
options, and the great benefit of vented front rotors, 5-lug rims etc.  But 
for a 914-4 you have a nice low-buck, readily available alternative.  Why
not use porsche calipers instead of BMW??

By the way---if you choose to take apart the vented type calipers I would 
like to buy those old center spacers for a project to widen the rear's on
my 914-6.

Thanks and good luck
