Dave Darling raises a point that is probably dear to all of us, maybe
even a sore spot. On the one hand I have found my well-cared for (thank
you POs) '75 2.0 to be very reliable between random (and spectacular)
age-related failures of 20-year old parts. On the other hand, my wife
refuses to venture further than walking distance from home in this car
(see "spectacular" above). Rather than argue, I let her talk me into an
RS America as our "reliable" car :-).

I would say the 914 was reliable when new and can be again IF MAJOR WEAR
SYSTEMS have been renewed. (And a 914 with old parts is still more
reliable than almost any other car with comparably-aged parts.) In
short, how many other 20 year old cars are regularly flogged at the
track and driven on the road? How many would you even want to?
