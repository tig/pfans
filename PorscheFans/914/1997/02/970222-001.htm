For Jeff Lorenttzen and any other interested parties:

  Jeff asks about the turn signal flasher:

"  The left signal works fine, when I flip the lever to the right I hear a
kind of buzzing behind the dash and no flashing lights. ......
.........The relay is current dependant?    "

  Yes, this is correct, the flasher depends for it's proper functioning on 
the normal current from the signal lamps being drawn through it.
 
"   Figure I'll check the bulbs first since that is easy, but if not that 
then where to check next,...."

  This is a good place to start, but don't forget to clean / tighten the 
socket contacts.  Radio Shack TV tuner cleaner works OK for this 
purpose, and is readily available.  I'd also look inside the front fender 
wells; there is a boot over the terminals on the turn signal "bucket", 
but it often fits poorly, or may even be non-existant.  Check the 
push-on terminals under this boot; remove them, spray with cleaner, 
and replace to "exercise' the contact area.
  In the rear, the push-on terminals are under the light fixture.  If you 
have had any water intrusion into the trunk via leaking around the 
light assemblies, you may have corrosion problems here too.
  Check for bad crimp connections; these are really not designed for 
water resistance, and you may have to cut the wire ends back until 
you find relatively clean wire, and then crimp on new ends.  A good 
voltmeter may help in isolating the exact location of the high 
resistance connection.
  Don't forget to verify ground integrity, and spray and rotate the fuses 
in the fuse block under the dash; european style fuses are prone to 
corrosion at their ends.

				Good Luck,
				Jim T.
