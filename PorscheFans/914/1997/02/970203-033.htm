Good advice, Rocky.

Something else that everyone might want to keep in mind:

There are TEN PorscheFans sub-lists; it's hard to imagine that any 
one message needs to be posted to more than two of them at a time.

PLEASE take just one moment to think before copying general-interest 
messages to every one of the PorscheFans lists; the "General" list is 
there precisely so you DON'T have to do this.

The aforementioned gazillion-copies message belonged on, at most, the
"General" and "Racing" lists.  Similarly, the recent speeding-ticket
discussion on the "911" list should have been on the "Tavern" list,
and the 911-engine-in-a-912 thread on the "911" list should've moved
either to the "Flamers" list or to private e-mail as soon as it
started to turn nasty.

Just my opinion; I could be wrong.
