<< >The one other option that would be really great    is to get  front 911 S
 alloy calipers and install using the caliper adaptors from Stoddard (
 SIC.351.911.00 with only slight modification to original struts )  Has
anyone
 tried this adaptor ?  Then do the above rear upgrade and Cool Carbons all
the
 way around.< >>

Hi, I can't speak for the Stoddard adapters, however I will throw in my
..02 on the Alloy calipers.  It has been my experience, and that of many
others who I can reference, that these calipers exhibit an excessive amount
of flexing under hard braking such as in racing or track events.  My friend
a long time Porsche SCCA racer warned me but I bought them anyway.

After a half of a season they went into the swap meet bin, and I had a hard
time 
getting rid of them at that.  They flex giving the impression that the lines
aren't bled, or that the fluid is starting to boil, this also causes the pads
to wear
at an angle.    You would never notice this on the street probably, but 
I would bet you will find flex on the track.  

If I hadn't later talked to many PCA club people who also experienced this
I would have thought maybe I had a bad pair.  

You can make your own decision, but if you are serious about the track
use, forget'em.

Thanks,
