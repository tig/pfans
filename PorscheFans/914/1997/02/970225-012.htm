I don't know about adapting one from another car, but I think that
J.C.Whittlebucket still carries a kit that is all in the door and complete
with rubber plugs for the holes that the handle leaves. It has an adapter
that slides over the handle spline and it is driven by a cable attached to
a small motor and can be positioned anywhere in the door. I put one of
these kits on a 95 Plymouth mini van 2 years ago with no problems except
one adjustment. Pretty clean setup for a aftermarket job. Comes with
switches, wiring harness and adapters for many different handle splines.
Seems the 2 door kit was on sale for around $100.00 at the time.
