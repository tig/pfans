>POR-15 without a doubt John. We have tried it all.  Repairing rusty 914s
>every day as we do, we need to use the best and the easiest. POR-15 is it.
>Make sure hovever that you recoat with a topcoat.  POR-15 is UV sensitive.

I have used both POR 15 and Corroless (Eastwood Company Product), I prefer
Corroless, easier to apply, topcoat, and fills in pits. POR15 on the other hand
is an epoxy type paint, it is good, but once hardened it will set hard, in
anything or on anything, ruin a spray gun quick.  Plus I metal prep, extremely
well, and I have had POR 15 fail to bond to clean metal surrounding the repair,
Corroless has not  failed me yet.  I also put both to the test on my old Chevy
Astro, lots of hard miles on that one.  POR 15 had problems with the bonding,
where Corroless, would stay.  Another plus for Corroless is it can be sanded
smooth, has a nicely fill paint chips, great for chip repair, and once the can
is opened you can keep using it.  POR 15 will last about 3-4 weeks.  One
advantage to POR 15 is that you can bond in fiber glass cloth into the painted
surface, and actually build up an area.  

Each has there place in rusto ration POR15 has advantages, but it is not my
choice for final coat painted surface, it excels at seam penetration, and also
fiberglass buildups.  Corroless excels at great exterior and detail work where
final look is important.  This product can make an inner fender well look like
new, with a top coat of paint.  I also like to use it as a temporary coating on
repair areas, if I know I won't get back to it for awhile.  In the end I reach
for Corroless, 8 times out of 10.
