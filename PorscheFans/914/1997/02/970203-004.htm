Hi 14ers

It's pretty scary when I send in my two pictures of my ugly work-in-progress,
and it doubles the number of pics on the PorscheFans 914 section of the home
page.  What's worse is I believe that Andy Warren sold his red beauty last week
, so that pic isn't even his anymore.  Which means, there are really only 3 pics
of 914 PorscheFans, and two of them are my heap.  I have a good shot of Bill
Newlin's, and if he'd register on that list, I'd send his in for him.  Where's
everyone else?  I'm sure if you need help scanning in your pic, I, or someone
else, would be glad to help you.  I didn't send in a pic of my 24' enclosed
trailer (behind my car) because it's up for sale (anyone interested?).  I've had
some prospects, and I'm hopeful to sell it, so I didn't think it right to put a
pic of it in there.
