Greetings 914-er's!

  Dirk Wright asks:

"  What voltage did you use, and how much current was the supply 
rated for?   Injectors are not designed for prolonged "open" 
operation, and the ecu has resistors in series with each injector to 
limit current draw during operation. I think you mistakenly ruined them 
by running DC through them for a prolonged period. I doubt it was the 
carb cleaner.   "

  Sorry, Dirk, but I will have to disagree on this one.  The power 
supply is a PowerMate current limited bench power supply, which 
can dish out about 1.5 amps maximum.  Since it's minimum voltage is 
about 3 to 4 volts, due to the regulator design, I usually set the 
voltage to about 6 volts and the adjustable current limit to a value 
that seems to open the injector reliably and solidly, which usually 
translates to anywhere from .6 to .9 amps, depending on where I feel 
like setting the knob. 
  Of course, when the supply is in deep current limiting, the voltage 
also falls back;  since the injector resistance is about 2.4 ohms, that 
would be 2.4 volts for a worst-case current of 1 amp.  This, of 
course, translates to about 2.4 watts;  I suspect that the duty cycle in 
the car results in more average dissipation than this, although they do 
have cool fuel present during normal operation.
  I must clinch the case by stating that I was aware of the pulse-mode 
normal duty cycle of the things, and I was careful to hold them open 
only for a limited time.  Finally, they were working fine when put away; 
the failure developed over time, and in storage. 
  After identifying the failure,  I tested them at a full unlimited 12 volts 
from the vehicle battery, and although the valves still failed to 
operate even under the over-voltage condition, the solenoid 
windings still had continuity.

"     It is entirely possible that the fault lies not with the 
gumout but with the fact that you left it to soak into the 
injectors. I have made it a habit never to wash VW or 
Porsche parts in any kind of liquid cleaner other than soap
and water since turning some parts into unrecognisable gooey
globs and watching others attain giant size overnight when 
left in solvent.   "

  I think that you are probably correct in this, especially since I had 
one comment to the effect that the commenter had also used carb 
cleaner, but had re-installed and run his injectors immediately and 
suffered no ill effects,  but we are left with too many unknowns:

	1.  If we use carb cleaner, how long can we leave the 
	injectors exposed before harm results?
	2.  If we flush out the carb cleaner, what sort of flush 
	should we use?  What method for flushing?  How 	
	detrimental is the flushing agent?
	3.  Do we need to air dry after cleaner?  Or flush?
	Or both?
	4.  Aircraft injectors are supposed to be cleaned in alcohol, 
	but these are not aircraft injectors.  What will alcohol do to 
	them?

........ and so on.  This is why I said fuel only;  I know that it's not a 
particularly good solvent, since it's the stuff that left the deposits in 
the first place, and, in addition, cleaning parts in gasoline is 
dangerous.  But... fuel is the only thing that I knew for sure was 
supposed to go through the injectors, and therefor the only thing that 
I felt comfortable in recommending.
  If anyone has concrete data on a safe and effective way to clean 
injectors on the bench, by all means, let him speak up.  I merely 
wanted to point out one way that FOR SURE DOES  N O T  WORK!
  Whether the problem was no flushing, or no drying, I cannot say for 
sure, and did not wish to speculate, because if I guessed wrong, it 
might mean considerable expense for someone else. 
   If anyone has a source of working used injectors, and wants to 
send them to me, I will try to find time to conduct a controlled 
experiment to determine exactly what techniques are safe, but to 
really get good data, I would expect to ruin upwards of 100 injectors. 
 Any volunteers?  Also, I think that it would be a good idea to take 
them apart, to make an accurate determination of the failure 
mechanism, but I poked at one of my old ones for a bit, and I haven't 
a clue as to how they come apart.  I wanted to preserve their value 
as rebuild cores, and so I didn't do anything drastic like sawing them 
open.  Does anyone know how to take the things apart so that they 
have a prayer of being reassembled?
  
  Thanks again for all the interesting and thought-provoking 
comments on this posting.  Hopefully, someone will come up with a 
safe way of cleaning injectors, and let us all in on it.

				Regards,
				Jim T.
