 Alot, How much money do you have ?
 Well, you came to the right place, Im going one and quite a few others
on the list are doing/did them. Here's the few things I could think of ,
off the top of my head, the guys will fill in the rest 
 You need ;
 1) Engine Mount
 2) Eng tins
 3) 914-6 oil tanks and lines
 4) 914-6 header and muffler
 5) switch to 5 lug suspension/wheels
 6) bigger brakes
 7) modify your gauges or buy 911 tach and pres/temp 
 
 If your in California you need a 75 AND UP engine for your car and the
cat will be a problem. Most of the guy who do it use early cars because
its easier and you have a wider range of engine's to pick from.
 Regaurdless of what it cost , they are a BLAST to drive. but dont put a
V8 in it, it will cost you about the same in the long run and you wont
have any resale value.
 Ask Andrew Warren, he did a hole car conversion and he wrote a post one
time that was very good, check in the archives for "best route to a
914-6" dated 12-2-96 Happy reading.
 Ok guys it your turn, fill in the blanks, 

 Later, Don
