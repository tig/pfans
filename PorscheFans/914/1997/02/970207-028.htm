Yeah, that was your typical infomercial. Several pictures and very little 
text. They cost about 350$ each, as I recall. They've been doing the 
dropped seat fix for quite sometime now, I've heard. There have been a 
few "infomercials" in Hot VW's about them. To prove their seats won't 
fall out, they put a slide hammer on them and couldn't pull them out. The 
valves in the 914 2.0 converted heads are stainless with chrome plated 
stems. It's good to see someone at least doing something about the cost 
of real 2.0 914 heads. Now if I could find a new, improved wiring harness 
for a decent price...
