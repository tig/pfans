Thanks for all the replies.  I didn't' find the problem yet but did check a
few things, and have a question about the normal operation since this is
first 914.

I checked bulbs, and tried swapping them side to side. Problem stayed on
passenger side, bulbs are good.  I did notice some corrosion, and the boots
under the front fenders are falling apart, on my list of things to order.
I'll try cleaning all contacts next.

When I turn on the left turn signals which flash properly at fenders, the
left/right arrow indicators in the tach both flash. Is this normal or a
problem? From the wiring diagram I expected just the left to flash.  When I
try the right turn signal I get no lights at the fenders, no arrow lights
in the tach, and hear the relay buzzing.  Do these symptoms still sound
correct for a bad wire/connection on the passenger side turn signal
circuit?

For Jeff Lorenttzen and any other interested parties:

 Jeff asks about the turn signal flasher:

"  The left signal works fine, when I flip the lever to the right I hear a
kind of buzzing behind the dash and no flashing lights. ......
.........The relay is current dependant?    "

 Yes, this is correct, the flasher depends for it's proper functioning on
the normal current from the signal lamps being drawn through it.

"   Figure I'll check the bulbs first since that is easy, but if not that
then where to check next,...."

 This is a good place to start, but don't forget to clean / tighten the
socket contacts.  Radio Shack TV tuner cleaner works OK for this
purpose, and is readily available.  I'd also look inside the front fender
wells; there is a boot over the terminals on the turn signal "bucket",
but it often fits poorly, or may even be non-existant.  Check the
push-on terminals under this boot; remove them, spray with cleaner,
and replace to "exercise' the contact area.
 In the rear, the push-on terminals are under the light fixture.  If you
have had any water intrusion into the trunk via leaking around the
light assemblies, you may have corrosion problems here too.
 Check for bad crimp connections; these are really not designed for
water resistance, and you may have to cut the wire ends back until
you find relatively clean wire, and then crimp on new ends.  A good
voltmeter may help in isolating the exact location of the high
resistance connection.
 Don't forget to verify ground integrity, and spray and rotate the fuses in
the fuse block under the dash; european style fuses are prone to corrosion
at their ends.

   Good Luck,
   Jim T.
