	Hi, folks.  I get asked about 914 reliability (generally by
perspective owners) fairly frequently.  Often enough that a question
of that type will probably go into the next version of the FAQ (when-
ever that might get done).
	I have been glad to give people my opinion on the subject
(when have I not?), but I'd like to see some discussion of what other
people think.

	My reply is unfortunately influenced by the two 914s that I
have owned.  You all presumably know about the large amounts of time
and money that I have put into the 2.0L in particular.
	I usally tell them that the 914 is *not* a modern "appliance"
type automobile.  It will turn around and bite you if you ignore the
maintenance.
	Every 914 is now old enough to legally drink in the US.  The
cars have often been driven pretty hard, as they are "sporty" (and fun)
little cars.  This combination can lead to problems.  Even moreso, when
combined with the idea that many previous owners have held, "It's just
a Bug, I don't have to fix it correctly."
	I know that these cars *can* be reliable and troublefree, but
the major proportion of them will have some sort of problems.  I know
that mine have.
	And for all that, if I could only own one car in the world,
my cranky old 2.0L would be the one.  They are that much fun.  Happily
I can own two cars--one for fun, and one that starts every day.

	Does anyone have a different perspective to offer?  Do most
people agree with this?  Your feedback is welcome, and will hopefully
be consolidated into the next revision of the FAQ.
