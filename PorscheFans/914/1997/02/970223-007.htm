Saddly this is true. You cannot modify the hubs or swap them with a unit
that does not qualify as an update/backdate operation. This is doubly so
because most five-lug conversions involve installing a 911 front-end
with brakes and all that. And _that_ is expressly forbidden.

So, in the interest of all CSPers out there I will ask the all important
question. 

--"What is the minimum backspacing that one can use with stock fenders
for a 15x7 and what is needed to shoe-horn a 15x8 back there?"--

 I recall the number 5.5" being  mentioned, but I'm not sure if that's
correct. Anyone else out there know for sure?
