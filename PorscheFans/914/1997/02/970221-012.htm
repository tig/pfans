I had a thought last night, while I was lying on the couch recovering from
several evenings of car repair, that it would be interesting if Porsche
built an even less expensive car than the Boxster. What would it look
like? 

My best guess (or concept) was that it would be similar to the 356 but
with updates to the suspension, steering and brakes, and use a rear
mounted water cooled flat 4 engine, Subaru-style. The engine could be the
current style of 4 valves per cylinder, double overhead cams, EFI, etc.
and produce more power than the regular 356 engines ever did. (they could
even buy them from Subaru - nah. Hey! maybe they should form a joint
marketing company - Porsche-Subaru, and sell the hybrids as Porsches in
America and Subarus elswhere. Oops, I think that's already been done -
darn. I can see it at a PCA meeting ten years later - "Hey, look at the
Subaru!")

I guess if I was more wealthy I could build one myself from a 356 shell,
but that not being the case, I am left with just a fantasy. 

A small 4 cylinder car could probably be sold in the 20-30K range, which
would put it within reach of millions more people than the Boxster. (I
earn almost twice the base price of a Boxster, and you-know-what will have
to freeze over before I can afford one. Either that, or I'll have to wait
for Publisher's Clearinghouse to come banging on my door). Porsche
probably wants to stay upmarket for prestige reasons, but thier near-death
experience a few years ago should have killed off that attitude. A 
Porsche "for the rest of us" anyone?
