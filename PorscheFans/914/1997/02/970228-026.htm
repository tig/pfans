Hi 914-er's!

"   My '74 914 2.0 engine is displaying some baffling behavior! The 
#1 exhaust valve clearance seems to change at random. It can be 
properly set, then the car driven 20 miles, and after cool-down the 
clearance has changed. It might now be non-existent, or way too 
wide! This follows a head rebuild in which valve seats, guides, and 
the valves themselves were replaced. On disassembly, all of these 
components appear to be working normally without unusual loseness 
or binding.  Anybody..... want to venture a guess as to what
might be the problem?

  I'll guess, but you won't like it.  This sounds just like what happened 
to my '74 2.0 litre just before the compression collapsed in # 4.  I 
won't have time to pull my engine and tear it down until next 
weekend, but I am guessing Dave Darling Syndrome ( dropped valve 
seat ).
  The fact that the seats seem firmly emplaced at room temperature is 
probably not a good indication of what they do when warm.  A friend 
of mine used to do his own installations of valve seats in alloy heads. 
 He told me that he'd stick the head on an electric hot plate to warm 
it up, stick the replacement valve seat in the freezer, and when both 
reached their respective thermal equallibriums, he'd just drop the seat 
in the hole.  A couple of taps with a miniature hammer and it would 
pop right into place.
  You might try warming your head in your kitchen oven at 350 
degrees or so, and check the seats for tightness then.
  
  There was a thread on the list a while back concerning this very 
thing.  There was some argument about which head re-builders could 
be trusted, and which could not.  One professional engine 
builder said that he had valve seats moving 2000 miles after 
having them all replaced by an otherwise reputable machine shop.  
There was one outfit that offered a 5-year / 100,000 mile warranty 
against valve seat migration.  There were also a couple of others 
recommended, and some notes to the effect that the job of installing 
seats is tricky, and not every machine shop knows how to do it right.

  If I find that I have dropped a seat, I think I'm going to give the 
100K warranty guy a call.
