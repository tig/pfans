    Nope... I still have the car.  The guy turned out to be sorta
    unfocused; he wanted a competitive Club Racer, but he also
    wanted the car to be suitable for the autocrosses that he planned
    to do before stepping up to Club Racing, AND he wanted the car to
    be completely street-legal so he wouldn't have to trailer it to
    his mechanic.

    His mechanic liked the car a lot, but was concerned about the low
    ground clearance and long front overhang... On an autocross
    course in a parking lot with dips, he was worried that the nose
    and the front-mounted oil-cooler could be damaged.

    Didn't seem like a big deal to me -- I mean, the airdam is only
    fiberglass; if there WERE a problem, it'd be pretty easy to
    modify it -- but it was important enough to him that he's now
    considering building a car from scratch.
