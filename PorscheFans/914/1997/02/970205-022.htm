  Hey Dave,

  If you get them please post since I'll be looking into it soon.

  Also would like opinions from anyone on the clear rear window vs.
  defrost.   My current car has a clear rear window.  From my previous
  parts car I have a rear with the defroster lines and associated switch,
  relay, wires.  I could change over when I reseal the rear.   I live near
  Los Angeles as far as climate.  Anyone had both types? How often does the
  rear fog up?  I'll be parking outside, usually have a car cover on it
  though.

  Subject:  Rear Window Replacement?



  New Text Item:  Text Item

 With luck, I am going to make my rear window stop rattling
this weekend.  Does anyone have a set of instructions for doing
the R&R?
 I've done the "pull the interior apart" bit before, but I
have no idea what to do once I've gotten to that point.  I know
about the instructions on Tim's fan page, but I'm looking for some-
thing more oriented toward "the compleat idiot".  Just *what* do I
cut, and when?
 I got a look at Jim Pasha's tech article in Excellence back
in November, and that looked pretty close to what I need, but I
don't have a copy of my own.
 Anyone?  Thanks!
