I've also got both types.  The car currently has the defroster, but I plan
on putting in the clear one, even though it often fogs up when left sitting
here in OR.  The defroster takes quite a while to work, and given that I'm
trying to clean up the interior, it's not worthwhile to keep around.  It's
not a *real* long stretch to the rear window..... =8^)
