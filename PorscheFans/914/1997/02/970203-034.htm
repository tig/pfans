Ben:

The key is to take ALL of your measurements (front and rear) from
the vehicle centerline.  Calvin Sanders has wriiten a good
explanation of do-it-yourself alignment techniques; it's on his web 
page at:

    http://www.vtr.org/maintain/diy-alignment.html

John Straub, who used to own the best Porsche alignment shop in San
Diego (and was editor of the best PCA newsletter in the country for
a while), is on the list... Maybe he'll have something to say on the 
topic.
