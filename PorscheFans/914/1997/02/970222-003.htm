>>The only other thing that I would REALLY like to see, is a tubular 
space frame, or at least a tubular sub frame from the firewall back.  
That way, the whole rear end of the car could be made to pivot up and 
back, just like on a real race car, so that working on the thing would =
be 
more of a pleasure, instead of a chore.

Peugeot already did this with the  205 based GROUP B rally cars, yes
there where sold for street use.  Lets see a turbo charged 16v engine
mounted mid ship with ALLWHEEL DRIVE, hey it had to go head to head with
the Audi Quattro.

Dave, sorry but your idea has been done, by VW already.  Back in the 80's
VW used to try and run Pikes Peak.  Some of the works cars came over with
the usual front engine, and some came over with two engines.  One in the
usual place the other mounted in the rear trunk to drive the rear wheels.
 The interesting thing about the design is it worked.  If I remember
correctly they even had it set up so the driver could bias engine out put
to induce oversteer or under steer.  I know they did a couple of turbo
versions also, but no G-60s since that development was still a far piece
off.  Yes latter they got a little more conventional and made the syncro
Golfs, and yes they had a G-60 and all wheel drive.
