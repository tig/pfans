Well, like I said, I've never used them in a racing environment, where I
fading is a big issue.  That said, I have driven them (on three different
cars) hard on the street, and never noticed any problems. In fact, I drove
two of those cars (a 914 and an Alfa GTV) on the track, and again, there
was no fade, but these were driving schools, not races.

HTH,

Greetings all!

Well, after no help from the US support for NTMail, I went to the U.K.
Support.  Much better!  It took some work to analyse (have to spell it their
way) the problem, but they had me make some changes, and so far soo good. 
Yesterday's digests were the first to be affected by the changes, and there
are no repeats that I can see.  I'll be keeping an eye on things.

> Does anyone out there have PC software that can split the digest

read/sorted/filed/deleted?

I've heard of a few mail clients that do this, but I don't know of one right
off.  One tool I've found that does work (suprisingly enough) is WinZIP.
Yeah, WinZIP.  I'm using v6.2  I didn't believe it either, but it works!
