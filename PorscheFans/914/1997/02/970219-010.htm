>Oh yeah??? Well, I bet Authority makes a chip for it
	that'll take it up to 900hp! The get yourself some
	of those Hot Wires and Splitfire spark plugs and you'll
	really be flying. You still won't catch the JATO powered
	amadillo at WOW (wide open waddle), though...

Yeah, but at least you can shut it down, and watch the armadillo go SPLAT into a
canyon wall.  

BTW, people see to forget that a JATO powered car goes fast, but your brakes are
not worth spit to slow you down, even with Pagid ORANGE pads.  You are along for
the ride until the fuel runs out, or you run out of time.

Me thinks I remember reading something about a Caddy and a canyon wall, with a
JATO mounted in the trunk.  All I can say is evolution in action.  Hey maybe
Darwin was right.
