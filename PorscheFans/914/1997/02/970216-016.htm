*** Ignorance Alert!! Message follows ***

Greetings 914'ers.  

I'm considering buying a 914 which is an "urgent sale" but
not in great shape (it should get inspected by a Porsche shop
in the coming week). It's a '70 model, has a carbed engine
of claimed 1750cc (probably a 1670cc engine).
Obviously if there's structural rust it's a no-no, but the 
two major cost items are trans work and paint. The 2nd &
3rd gear synchros are on the way out & the car's present
red paint (tangerine ex factory) is very tired.

Is it practical for an inexperienced person (that's me) to
remove the transmission, fit new synchros and whatever else
usually wears out, and put it all back together without 
risking disaster? If I have to get a shop to do it this
will obviously affect the economics of buying this car.
On the other hand, I guess the lessons would be transferrable
to the 911 ('69 911E Sporto).

Thanks
