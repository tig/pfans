Well, I'll post one more message, since there seems to be an interesting
difference
of opinion here.
I was wondering if it would be a good thing to replace my brake
proportioning valve
on my daily driver '71 914 1.7.
It seems to stop pretty well (using A032's, anyway), and seems to be very
stable
under braking, but anything worth doing is worth overdoing!

Here are two (somewhat inconsistent) answers I got--
both make sense to me--hope the senders don't mind a repost--
anyone else want to join in?
(And thanks to Dave and Daniel for their help!)
