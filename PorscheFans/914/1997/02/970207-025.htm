Your Dampness:

Thanks for the explanation about Newlin's inside wipers.

Now I get it (the gutteral noise that is).  Sometimes this over 40 German brain
don't work as godd as it used tah.  Here I was trying to figure out what that
was an acronym for : - )  I should have stood back and not been so literal.

Your Dampness Dave:

Thanks for the explanation about Newlin's inside wipers.

Now I get it (the guttural noise that is).  Sometimes this over 40 German brain
don't work as good as it used tah.  Here I was trying to figure out what that
was an acronym for : - )  I should have stood back and looked at it, and not
been so literal.

What good is any windshield wiper without a windshield?  I know.  You could
attach mini-mannequin arms to them, and when you win a race, turn them on as if
to wave at the fans as you do your parade lap for winning.  Even stick the
checkered flag in one of the hands.

As an aside, I haven't received a PFans post for 2 days.  Is it 'cos they may be
fixin' that poor fellows repeat problem or something?  It's like the second or
third time I've sent a post that takes up about 2 pages of printed space
(considerable bandwidth) and then I don't receive anything for days afterward.
It's like I'm getting punished for writing and taking up too much space : - )  I
know that's not it, but it's a funny occurrence.
