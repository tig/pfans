  I recall this subject going around before but don't recall conclusion.  I
  want to change the tranny lube in my new car since don't know how long
  it's been in there.  I recall a message that said Swepco was the best to
  use, but at $44 a gallon, and if should be changed every other oil
  change???

  I was considering using the same stuff I use in VW Thing tranny, StaLube,
  and adding a tube of Lubro MoS2 Gear treatment to it.

  This will be a street car.  Any comments, I don't know much about the 914
  trannys yet.
