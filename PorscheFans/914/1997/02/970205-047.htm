Hi Dave

I've done my rear window in my previous 914, and am about to do this one,
as soon as I have time at work.  So we'll have to send each other tips
after the fact, depending on who finishes first, right?

Anyways, quickie run-down.

1. disassemble interior roll bar trim & remove back pad.  It took *way* too
much time to pull the roll-bar padding last time.  couldn't find those damn
philips screws.  try to keep cursing and swearing down to a minimum :)

2. carefully wiggle glass (mine just about fell out last time)

3. if glass does not fall out, look at the edges where it was bonded to the
body.  This was a urethane bead of some sort.  You can cut through this
with appropriate blades (single edge razor blade if the bent windshield
blade is not availible) lubricating the blade with wd40 or similar helps
cut a *lot* faster

4. clean area of old bonding material, and clean glass thoroughly (rub
glass cleaner until glass is squeaky clean)  this is a good time for rust
removal (if any.)

5. have glass guy apply urethane primer & urethane bead, and have him bond
in the glass in for you.  

6. re-install roll-bar trim, back pad, and seats.  

In sunny california, you should be able to drive around with no rear window
if necessary.  And the seats only take seconds to pull out.  It's much
easier for mr. glass guy to do the window when he can stand inside the car
with the top off.

Up in rainy vancouver, we have a glass guy come by our shop with the proper
chemicals.

Hope this helps,

ps I watched the glass installation last time, and don't really want to try
it
myself.  It looks potentially very messy, and you only get one try with the
urethane.  Besides, he only charged me $10 last time (1995)--and better not
charge too much more this time.
