OK, here's my method, but warned some will scream that it's wrong!!

Basically, if the follower is on the base circle of the cam, you can 
adjust that rocker. There is about 180deg of base circle to work with on 
each lobe. Also, if one valve of a pair is open, then the other valve has 
to be on the base circle (within a reasonable amount of rotation). You 
can bet that if one valve is open the other is fully closed, except for a 
small portion of the rotation where there is valve overlap. There is very 
little overlap with the stock cam, so you can generally rely on the fact 
that if one valve is open, the other is closed.

So, with one rear wheel in the air, the transmission engaged in fifth, and
the valve cover off, you can crawl under the car and turn the wheel to
alternately open and close the valves on that side without ever having to
crawl back out and check where the distributor is pointing. When you're
done with one side, lower that wheel, then go to the other side.  Once
you're done, the engine should have a nice "sewing mcahine" sound to it. 
That's one of the things I like about air cooled engines, you can hear all
those little noises that get muffled in water cooled engines (of course
there times when those noises will tell you that the engine is about to
explode, but hey). It'll be easy to tell if one valve was adjusted wrong
by the noise it'll make.
