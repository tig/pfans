Hello 914ers,

 Well I hit the Porsche swap meet in Redondo Beach put on by the 356
club. Alot of 356 parts, some 911 stuff and two guys selling 914 parts.
It was a pretty good turn out.

 I picked up all the 5 lug stuff for member Jeff Lorentzen so he can
dump the adapters and not worry about a wheel falling off.

 I also looked at a car for another member of the list thats out of
state.

 While out looking I came across a 914-6 for sale for 6 Grand.
 Its all original and all there, didnt look too hard but didnt find any
major rust, pan was in very good condition . Never hit in the front but
had a dent in the rear apron.the paint was horrible (black) but the body
was straight, the engine was frozen but all there.it also had the deep
off set early alloys. So it needs a restoration but seemed to be a very
good car for it. The car is in So. California. I have no interest in the
car and Im not getting anything out of it, just thought one of you guys
might want it. Email me for more info

 Don
