     out and replaced But I need to stop the rust growth.  I have seen the 
     POR15 ad in some catalogs but want to get some real world
     input on this subject. "
     
     
     Just want to add my experience with rust conversion coatings.  I use 
     Corrless, POR 15 and Extends.  All have there place:
     
     POR-15 - This is a isocyanate cure paint so be sure to use the 
     appropriate mask.  Isocyanates are VERY toxic.  POR-15 adheres well to 
     a rust pitted surface but not to a clean, smooth surface.  Roughening 
     the surface of new steel helps, but the adhesion is still not that 
     great.  The dried paint is very hard and cannot be removed with 
     solvents or strippers.  This is an advantage if you seam seal over the 
     top of it.  The solvent of the seam sealer will not dissolve and smear 
     the paint when you apply it.  You have to clean your gun thoroughly 
     immediately after use or you will ruin it.  Nothing will dissolve this 
     stuff once it hardens.  I have one of those real cheap guns ($29 jobs) 
     for this.  I haven't ruined a gun with it but I wouldn't want to risk 
     a good gun by using this stuff in it. The paint left in the can will 
     harden if you don't seal it well.  A layer of heavy plastic bag placed 
     between the lid and the can (as per the instructions) works well.  It 
     seals the can and keeps the paint from welding the lid onto the can.  
     POR-15 does not come in aerosol spray cans.
     
     Corrless - Does a great job as well and has better adhesion to clean 
     steel.  It does not harden and can be removed with solvent or 
     stripper.  This will dissolve in seam sealer solvent and mixes in with 
     it as it is applied.  I don't think this hurts anything but it looks 
     sloppy.  You can buy this in aerosol or can.  The aerosol is handy to 
     have around for small jobs.  The nozzle of the aerosol can will clog 
     unless you take the nozzle off the can and store it in solvent.
     
     Extends - This is cheap, available everywhere and works pretty well.  
     I put a topcoat of a something else on top to protect it.  The Extends 
     seems to leave a thin coating.  The paint is clear but turns black as 
     it reacts with rust (you can actually see the conversion in progress). 
      I have found that Extends works well on cast iron parts.  The other 
     two just don't adhere well to cast iron.  
     
     Recently I have been using a coating of Corrless or Extends (better 
     adhesion) followed by a coating of POR-15 (real hard surface).  I 
     don't know if this is really better than a single product but it makes 
     me feel better.  Hope this helps.
