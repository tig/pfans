I hate to be a flamer, and I know this was bantered about yesterday, but it sure
will be nice to not receive bandwidth which includes 45 posts, which occupies
the equivalent of 52 pages typed, OVER HALF OF WHICH ARE REPEATS, from some poor
guy who can't break free of his errant AOL account.  Somebody, paleeeeeeeez help
that guy out, so we can get back to reading sanity again.

Regarding the thread about the sheepskin covers - I'm surprised that Dirk Wright
hasn't responded yet about how to go driving around visiting your friendly
butcher to ask for pelts and then go home with them to tan them yourself : - )
: - )  : - )  Dirk's always handy with those sorts of base survival advice.
He's a 1985 graduate of the Rambo School Of Survival you know :-]  (Jim Thorusen
graduated from there in 1986.)

Regarding Dave Darling writing, " Not only is it not necessary to have the tray
on the car, but it isn't even necessary to have the engine lid!  I inadvertently
found this out last night.  The lid is off the car because one of the brackets
is broken (just ordered new one today--aah, motivation!) and the rain caught me
at work.
It *is*, however, necessary to have the *ROOF* on the car.  It is distinctly
uncomfortable driving a topless 914 in the rain at speeds under about 40 MPH.
And you get a lot of funny looks from everyone else on the road."

FYI Dave.  I grew up 50 miles away from NYC, out on Long Island (don't hold that
against me).  My next door neighbor for most of my high school years was a Brit,
temporarily living in The Colonies for a few years, and commuting to NYC as an
advertising creative artist type.  This was the sort of fellow parents hate for
their sons to idealize.  He imported/exported (depending on which shore you're
speaking from) his MGB (resplendent with Rover V-8) over here so he'd have his
favorite ride to commute in, while on assignment.  I won't get into what it's
like to commute on the Long Island Expressway (the world's largest parking lot)
here.

The point is his attitude about being a "true" sports car owner and driver.  He
preached that if a sports car is delivered to you with a removable top, that
means it is to be _removed_ as you drive off the showroom floor, and tossed
(that's what that garbage can is for outside the dealer's front door).  Yup,
this chap didn't have his top even attached to his ride.  Rain, shine, snow,
sleet, you get the picture.  The thing to do is to always wear "wash & wear"
clothing, nothing that requires ironing, and have an extra set of dry apparel
hanging behind your office door(s) in case it really got unbearably soggy.  He
figured that if you couldn't obey those rules, you were too much of a stuffed
shirt.

So Dave, sell your top to someone who's competing in a concours, or some artist
who's recreating the Viet Nam Veteran's Memorial Wall out of 914 tops.  Throw
caution to the wind and enjoy the elements.  Ask Bill Newlin what he thinks of
914 autocrossers with tops on.  FYI, if you forget my "Getting To Know You" bio
(tome), I've variously been a long-hair & short-hair.  However the spirit moves.
A musician, Viet Nam era veteran, automotive engineer, corporate type, and
entrepreneur.  I love the wind (and sometimes rain) in the hair.

All in fun :-]  Now go dry off.

_/  \_ I'd rather be autocrossing.
