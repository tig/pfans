Michael:

Why switch to the 915 at all?  It's heavier, harder to find gears
for, and it requires a whole BUNCH of work to adapt to a 914.

To adapt it, you'll need a "916" kit to convert it from tail- to 
side-shift, a pull-clutch - to - push-clutch conversion kit, a new 
clutch, and you'll need to flip the ring gear so you have five 
forward speeds instead of five reverse speeds.

Figure on spending AT LEAST three thousand dollars for the
conversion.

If you aren't planning to do standing starts, the 901 is plenty
strong enough for your 2.7-liter motor.  I have a 901 in my 2.7 Euro
Carrera RS-powered 914, and it's had NO problems; additionally, all
the successful SCCA GT-2 racers I know use a 901, and their engines
put out around 300 HP.  

This is all just my opinion, of course, and others might give you 
different advice, but if it were ME in your position, I'd just 
put a Quaife (or a Porsche LSD) on my 901 and be done with it.
