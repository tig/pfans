	My own thoughts on that matter were a bit closer to home.  I used
to bore Dirk Bergstrom and Josh2 with speculations about it...  (And
remember, this was before the Boxster was anything more than a show-car.)
	OK: Take a VW Golf drivetrain, complete.  Engine, transmission,
half-shafts, all that.  Now put it where it belongs--right behind the pas-
senger compartment, driving the rear wheels.  Assemble car around it.
Use lots of off-the-shelf equipment--perhaps the 993's aluminum sub-frame
could also be used for this thing's rear suspension?  Maybe GTI brakes,
possibly with an upgrade option to use the 993's brakes?  There are lots
of possibilities.
	One of the interesting things about it is that there are a whole
BUNCH of engine options to choose from.  Everything from a pretty mild
four-banger, through the zippy GTI four-banger, to the superchaged V-6
that VW was using for a while, to their new turbo diesel.  (Why?  I don't
know!  Why not?)  They ought to bolt right up, since VW has been putting
them into the front of their Jetta/Golf/whatever for quite a few years,
and the engineering of the drivetrain is already done!
	Torque-steer might be a problem because of the unequal-length
driveshafts, but hopefully it would be made manageable somehow.
	I would be hoping for a price tag starting in the upper $20K
range.	Put a removable hardtop on the car, and guess what you have?  A
914 for the 90s!  A big problem would be, what do they sell it as?  A VW?
A Porsche?  What?

	Oh well--I guess I'm just a diehard 914 nut.
