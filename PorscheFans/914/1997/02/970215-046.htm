Following the recent posts about the engine lid and tray restricting 
air flow to the engine, I recently had occasion to drive with the 
engine cover removed.  I disconnected the vacuum gauge and let the pipe 
dangle in the engine room:

Now I know this wasn't very scientific or precise, but even at 5,000 
rpm, WOT in third gear the gauge was not showing any vacuum.  I then 
replaced the lid with drip tray and still cannot see any vacuum at high 
rpm, high speed.  

Yes, I know, it would be more precise to put an altimeter into the 
circuit, but it just has not been that important to me.  I believe all 
this worry about engine cooling air is just for naught.
