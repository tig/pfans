Fourteeners:
Now there's a creative day's worth of solutions.  I didn't intend to be a
flamer, otherwise I'd have gotten over on that subscription list and unloaded.
I was interested in seeing if we could come up with a creative solution, and, I
hadn't seen too much toward that end, just carping.

Thank you Dennis Mitsch for the explanation :-)  Now that we have a clue about
what's going on we can really be patient.  Without hearing that something was
being done, it was getting pretty bleak to think about booting up the mega
PorscheFans file each day and scrolllllllllllllling through them all.

Henry Bibb responds, "I'm not sure who the other fellow is, but given a
long-time net association with George Buselink, I think this "spam" is a mailer
run amok.  I've "known" George since the old Porshcephiles days, and he doesn't
do things like this - not willingly, anyway."
>
Thanks Henry. It appears that George and Ray aren't perpetrating any scheme to
spam us to death with ads.  That's good news.  We don't need letter bombs going
off amongst otherwise friendly fellow Porsche Nuts.  I'm glad to hear of the
integrity being maintained.
>>>

Dr. Dampness Himself, Dave Darling, wrote, "Remember, to "assume" is to make an
"ass" out of "u" and "me".
>
Jebby - Yeah, that's why I was treading lightly in what I said.  I'm no computer
whiz, nor full of understanding when it comes to these net-things.  Others had
already flamed out with explatives, and I wanted to see if we could help effect
a real solution.
>
Dave again - The real deal appears to be that the PFans mailer is having
problems.  Not AOL, not Ray and George.  It will do NO GOOD AT ALL to scream and
yell at those two (plus the three respondents to Ray who have gotten caught in
the same loop).  They aren't the problemI have it on authority that "someone"
has been working on the problem for a full week so far, but (as we can all see)
unsuccessfullyNow, what can we all do?  Well, we can waste bandwidth carping
about all the bandwidth that's getting wasted.  We can abuse people who are NOT
responsible for the problems (shame on you for even mentioning it, Jebby!).
>
Jebby - Sorry.  Not seeing any other plausible explanations, that's the way it
looked, and no one was stepping forward with those explanations, till just now.
All I was seeing was folks flaming back and forth.  I'm glad to see sensible
explanations now, and I'm sure everyone else is too.  I'll certainly be patient.
Knowing what's going on.  I think a good SOP would be to put a post at the
beginning of each problem-day, explaining in brief that the sysadmin is aware of
a prob with the day's posting, maybe a curt explanation, and a "please be
patient" notice.  It would kinda be like that music you hear when you're on
tele-hold, for some reason it makes you a bit more patient.
>
Dave again - We can unsubscribe until the problem gets straightened out.  We can
ignore the problem.  Some folks can set up mail filters that automagically trash
the two problem messages.  Or we could hold our breaths until we turn purple and
pass out.  Hey, it's your choice.  I assume (there's that word again!) that the
people on this list are adult enough to act in a reasonable fashion.
>
Jebby - Has every list been getting this multiplicative repeat stuff?  Hey, that
automagic trashing sounds like a neat feature, where do you get it from?  I'd
like to see a picture of you turning purple in the rain : - )
>>>

And lastly, but definitely not leastly, Dennis Mitsch wrote a great explanation,
"The problem is a broken mailer in pacific bell internet (pbi.net) if you look
at the headers, you will see the date and time of the original posters send
never changes - hence, only one message from them.

The gateway at pbi.net is what caused the resends, in the headers you'll
see that the only time the date/time changes is when it reaches that
machine.

Those of us who were able to recognize the problem have sent many many
posts to the appropriate parties at pacific bell.

The problem is that it appears to be a *very* subtle bug in their Sendmail
software.. the configuration file for this program looks something like a 
cross between line noise and ancient egyption hieroglyphics. :)

In any case, I think they have it sorted out now.  So hopefully we won't
see any more. :)"
>
Now there's a helpful sort of guy.  The adult sort that Dave was alluding to.
Thanks again Dennis.  I'm sure that if we'd seen that several days ago, we could
have avoided the excess flames, but I guess we learn as we go.

Jebby :-]
