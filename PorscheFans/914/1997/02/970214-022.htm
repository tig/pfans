I also add a caution if you are really going to adjust the proportioning valve
based on when tires lock up, You should be using relatively new tires (if they
are race compound).  I found that individual tires changed their grip as the
heat cycle.  I was surprised to see it happen differently side to side on my
911. The backs wear out quickly so it was an issue for my fronts only.  I
usually swap them side to side for different events to get even wear but one
hardened up much more than the other.  I suspect 914s (have not driven mine
yet) wear tires less than the 911 so if you have more than 10 or so track days,
you may be getting bad test results.  On the other hand, if you use track
rubber and have 10 days on them you're screwed in the rain anyway. Just a
thought

I thought about this too.  (So correct me if I'm wrong!)  But the
*ratio* won't change in wet weather.  Unless you have different
rubber compounds front and rear.  (Which none of *us* would do.)

Seems to me the proper thing to do is get some tires you don't mind
flat-spotting, go to a track and find the new balance adjustment.
Then as long as your tires match, you should be OK.

Gary.
