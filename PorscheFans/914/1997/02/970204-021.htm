Hi volks:

A couple of people commented privately to me, so thought I should pass 
some more info:

>> I stumbled across a transmission jack at a local swap meet yesterday
>> It was so little-used it still had the label - 450 lb max - just 
right>> for a 914 drivetrain.  It has a 14"x15" footprint, so should be 
stable enough to balance the load.  

Cost?  It is a Sears, but made in Taiwan.  It looks and sounds just 
like the one in the JCW catalog for $125.  I really hate buying Asian 
tools, but for $40 I could not resist.  Just like my Chinese floor jack 
- or any other - I will never trust my life to it.

>> It has a 1/2" socket drive attach, so I can use my air wrench to run 
it>> up and down.

Oxner Opined:

Maybe Service Bulletin 1 will be to replace the rivets with bolts.

>> Hey, this thing is a great toolbox caddy, an adjustable-height 
>>chair, and maybe a whirly skateboard.
>> Any other ideas for it?

One reply thought about offering some kinky uses for it, but thought 
better of it.
