	The rear window is done.  *whew!*  Thanks to all who provided
suggestions.
	Things That Didn't Work:  Bailing wire.  Broke two different
pieces.  Cutting with a knife.  Heating with a hair-dryer and cutting
with a knife.  Heating and cutting with a *new* utility knife.  Using
thin stranded wire.  (Made some progress, and lots of smoke. Then the
wire broke.  It also removed some previously-cut materal...)
	What finally worked:  I realized that I could cut much more
effectively if the "extra" black rubber goop that was hanging out of
the joint was gone.  So, I cut in at an angle and got a 1/8" to 1/4"
wide strip of the stuff off the car.  This only left a thin bead of
it (that was attatched to both car and glass) to cut, which I did with
the utility knife.  If I'd been bright enough to think of this in the
first place, probably any of the other methods would have worked.
	It only took a couple of minutes to do it, once I'd figured
out what to do.  "Why didn't I think of this a week ago?"
	The window cleaned up OK with Windex, acetone, and a razor
blade (actually the utility knife blade removed from the knife).  The
old sealing strip came off the car with a minimum of fuss.  Left some
behind where the bottom of the window goes, but I was able to clean a
lot of that off.  Cleaned the sealing area pretty well, then put the
new sealer in.  The window went in pretty easily, even though I forgot
to put the little rubber "supports" in at first.  The seat-backs and
some towels are currently clamping the window in, and a bar-clamp and
some wood blocks.  I heated up the garage before putting the new sealer
in, and tried heating up the window with the hair dryer after I had it
all in place and clamped.  I hope the seal holds for another 20 years.
	Tonight I'll start putting the interior back together, and
possibly try to clean and maybe even lube my seatbelt mechanism.  I'm
tired of having to extend the belt in 2" increments.
	Ya know, I'm starting to get the idea that I *can* do work on
this silly car!
