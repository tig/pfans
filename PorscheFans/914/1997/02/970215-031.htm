Hi 914ers  
I just thought I could add something to this brake bias 
discussion.

brakes.

My VW GTI has a mechanical SELF ADJUSTING brake biasing valve 
which attaches to the rear axle beam in such a way that as the 
rear of the car raises, (weight tranfer to the front wheels) the 
piston on the valve gradually cuts out the rear brakes. This is 
probably a big help during "three wheelin'" manuevers that these 
cars are known for. 

Food for thought anyway.
