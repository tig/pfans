Accordign to the "restorer's guide" they weren't a factory option. I'm 
not sure which wheels you're describing, also, since "Empi" wheels in the 
bug world are aluminum 5 or 8 spoke jobbies. The spokes are rounded as 
viewed from the outside of the wheel, and are usually either black or 
body color, the rim is usually natural aluminum color (either painted or 
polished). I think real Empis would have some value in the big world, 
since only reporductions are made now. These are cast wheels. also. 

A wheel worth chasing down (besides Fuchs) is the Mahl or ATS. I have a 
set of ATS, and they are extremely light weight - much lighter than the 
VW steel wheels. I know someone with a set of a Mahls, but they need 
refinishing - they are pitted.
