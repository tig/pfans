To the list at large:

  Someone (I forget who now) wrote:

"   Do you all not realize that the complaints about the drivers ed thing
take up as much bandwidth as the original problem?   "

  I must disagree with this... the repeating messages are now exceeding 
the list member postings by at least a factor of 10, at least at my 
location.
  I wrote to listmaster@porschefans.com yesterday, and suggested that 
these be filtered at the list server level.  I received a form letter about 
re-subscribing if I am experiencing difficulties.  I guess that my request 
got lost in the pile up, or something like that.  

  Does anyone know the listmaster personally?  Is it possible to either 
filter these things at the list server level, or perhaps break the link to the 
offending originating net until the problem is corrected?   I am not 
familiar enough with the internet to know if such things are possible or 
not, but I believe that this problem is affecting the list's utility; the 
number of messages that are real has dropped to only 5 or 6 a day, if 
that many.  The PorscheFans-914 list is a valuable resource; I hope 
that this problem does not kill it off.
