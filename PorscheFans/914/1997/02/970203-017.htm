I own a '73 914 that was originally a 1.7 liter car. It now has a 2 liter
in it. I have been autocrossing it since '87 and been having a great time
in it. It came with dual 40mm Delortos when I bought the car. I recently
bought a set of 7" wide Revolutions that fit within the original
wheelwells.

I have a question about adjusting the toe in the rear suspension. I know
that I need to loosen the 3 bolts anchoring the outer mount of the swing
arm. But I'm concerned that I may end up adjusting one side more than the
other and end up with a car going down the road like a dog (you know,
part sidways). Right now the rear is toed out 1/8". I would like 1/16" toe in.

Does anyone on the list know a do it yourself method for adjusting the
toe on the rear suspension accurately?

Thanks,
Ben Thatcher
