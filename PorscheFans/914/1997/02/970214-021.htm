   No, that isn't right.  (Hmmm, I can't help but wonder if Josh or Andy
will get this to the list before me! ;-)  The amount of "weight transfer"
depends on the conditions (i.e., the coefficient of friction).  If you
can't get much total braking (like in the wet), you can't get much weight
transfer, so the rears will be providing more braking than they normally
do.

  I was going to just point you at the excellent Physics of Racing series
(http://reality.sgi.com/employees/rck/PhOR/01-Weight-Transfer.html), but he
avoids dealing with coefficient of friction by just saying "suppose we are
braking at 1 G."  The braking acceleration (i.e., number of g's) you can
obtain depends on the slipperiness of the conditions.

   Before I go any farther, the fact that "coefficient of friction" (u) is not 
constant for auto tires as a function of applied load is NOT relevant here.
For these purposes, F=uN is okay.  The final answer as to which wheel locks up
under exactly which condtions may be off a little, but this is a subtlety for
this problem.  (There are other problems where it is NOT a subtlety.)

   The math says (provided I did it correctly) that the ratio of force 
 ("weight") on the front tire (F) to that on the rear (R) is:

 F/R = (b + u*h)/(a - u*h)     where a = distance from CG to front wheels, 
				     b = dist from CG to rear wheels, and
                                     h = CG height .

   So, you see that as u gets smaller, the weight transfer decreases, so the 
rear does more and more of the braking.  On ice, (u=~0), the F/R ratio is 
the same as the static weight distribution.
