For Michael Nugent and other interested parties:

Hi Mike!

  You asked:

"  Is there a head on the inside (that is, inside the caliper) of the outer 
venting adjustment 4mm Allen bolt (the one with the jam nut)?  Or 
would it come entirely out if you kept unscrewing it? ......
 ......Also, one of the four rear calipers I have has a c-clip that limits 
the jam nut travel, but the others don't - anybody know why?

  Following is an excerpt from my little blurb on rear caliper rebuilding; 
 basically, you can't get there from here.

>> Please note that the outer adjustment screw is, as I recall, 
devided into two right-hand threaded portions, a short outer one, and 
a long inner one, seperated by a shoulder on the screw which rides 
on the inside of the caliper.  Just outboard of this shoulder a groove 
is machined for a very tiny O-ring.  This seals the brake fluid inside 
the caliper.  The outer threaded portion has a groove machined right 
into the middle of the threaded portion to accept a circlip which holds 
the adjuster in place when it is turned clockwise (direction to retract 
the piston).  This circlip is visible right next to the caliper body as 
soon as the outer plastic dust cap is removed. 
  Please be sure to remove this circlip when attempting to break the 
screw free; other wise you will mangle the circlip (as I did).
  Once you get it loose, turn it counter clockwise until the piston falls 
out of the caliper.  Actually, the piston won't fall out; it will be 
necessary to unscrew the piston the last little bit from the adjustment 
screw by turning it in it's bore until you can remove it.  Now, you can 
turn the adjustment screw clockwise, and it will screw into the caliper 
body and fall out the cylinder bore in the caliper.  <<

  If your caliper is weeping around the venting clearance adjustment 
screw, you will have to dissassemble the caliper and fit a new O-ring 
to the adjustment screrw.  These O-rings are really tiny; I've never 
seen ones that small before.  They do come in the caliper rebuild kit 
from GPR; I don't know if you can find them seperately or not.
  Also, as noted above, the circlip is there to prevent the adjustment 
screw from threading into the piston self-adjusting device and 
dissapearing into the caliper.  Without it, you will have a heck of a 
time retracting the pistons;  all rear calipers (on 4 cylinder cars, 
anyhow) should have circlips present on the outboard adjusting 
screws.  
  And, last but not least, the sholder on the screw prevents it's being 
removed from the caliper except through the cylinder bore after the 
piston has been removed, as described above.

  I hope that this is of some help.

				Regards,
				Jim T.
