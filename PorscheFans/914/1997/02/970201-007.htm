For Gary Helbig,  Bernie Chmielew, and other interested parties:

Hi Gary!

  Thanks for the feedback.  I'm not sure that my problem has a similar 
cause, though, because...

  You wrote:

"   I use injection cleaner all the time.  Helps, but....  "

  The stuff that I used was not injector cleaner per see, it was 
Gumout spray-on carb cleaner... pretty volatile stuff...

"  I too had two fail at the same time.  They were the ones closest
to the pump, and so they clog first.  "

  This makes sense, except that the two that failed for me were on 
the left side, FARTHEST from the pump... go figure?   Of course,  no 
one can predict where dirt will lodge, but as I had just done a front 
fuel pump relocation, I put a shunt between the supply and return 
plastic lines in the engine bay and ran the pump for 2 or 3 minutes to 
purge the part of the system that runs from the tank to the rear of the 
car and back again. 

"  Gotta change the filter often!  "

 Also, the filter was brand new.  However, I appreciate your taking 
the time to reply... I hope the other two stay working... let you know...

  "  I cleaned out my injectors with spray can carb cleaner when I 
replaced the hoses last year.  I had the same thing happen upon 
start up.  Car started, ran like crap, turned out one	bank was dead.  
Solution was easier though.  I just had to make up the electrical 
connectors.....  Also I reinstalled them in the car and ran gasoline 
through them right away.  No problems once I remembered to plug 
them all in.   "

  Thanks Bernie.  I probably should have flushed mine out with 
gasoline before putting them away, but I didn't think of it.  The car 
was in a thousand pieces, and so I couldn't re-install and run them 
right away.
  The injectors were definately getting voltage pulses, according to 
my DVM, but were not rattling like those on the right side.  When I 
tried them on the bench again, they were stuck solid.

  I'll keep you guys posted on whether or not the other two survive 
another hiatus while I wait for new injectors to arive from GPR.

				Thanks Again,
				Jim T.
