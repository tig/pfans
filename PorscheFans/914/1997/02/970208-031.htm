hi,

I've been reading the list for some time now, hoping I never had to

write to it, but guess what?  O.K. here's the problem if anybody has any 

input I'd appreciate it.  The other day I took my 75 1.8l out for a ride

then it happened, between 2-3000 rpm's she starts shaking almost like I

have a flat.  Plus I lost alot of power, I was stopped on a hill and I 

had to rev it real high about 2,500 and ride the clutch to get her 

started.  When I'm going up a hill if I switch to a higher gear she 

starts to slow down.  But get this if I let off the gas she stops 

shaking.  If anybody had this problem or heard of it please let me 

know.


                                     Thanks,

					Gerard
