OK, I'm in the middle (still) of repairing my tansaxle. I've found that 
replacing synchros is easy, but it gets complicated very fast if any of 
the bearings are worn out. You can get an idea of the condition of the 
insides by the condition fo the oil thats in the case. Ifthe oil was 
replaced regularly (unlikely, but possible), then you're in luck. 
Otherwise, the bearings will need replacement, which will upset the ring 
and pinion configuration, leading to some complicated measurements, 
requiring some special and expensive tools. Rebuilt exchanges are around 
1500$ (U.S.), maybe more in S. Africa. The probelm with the 914 as I see 
it is that it's complicated for most people to work on, and mechanics 
don't like working on it either, so they usually wind up poorly 
maintained. My transmission was poorly maintained, and it requires a 
complete rebuild, including replacing first gear set. Stubborn that I am, 
I'm doing it myself, and it's taking forever because I don't have the 
special tools, and the parts are expensive. Other things are getting in 
the way, also.
