    Nope... You beat me.  Damn.

    You're right, of course.

    Here's how I look at it:

    When you set your brake-bias for dry conditions, you want a lot
    less pressure to the rear calipers than to the front, since
    weight transfer under braking will make the rears lock up
    prematurely if there's too much pressure back there.

    When you're driving in the wet, there's less weight transfer
    under braking, so the rears CAN provide more braking force.  If
    you leave your brake-bias set to its "dry" setting, though, the
    front wheels will lock up LONG before the rears even get close
    to lockup.

    In order to extract the most braking force in the wet,
    therefore, you need to INCREASE the pressure to the rear
    calipers.

    Note that if you DON'T readjust your brake bias in the wet,
    nothing terrible will happen... You just won't stop as fast as
    you could if the bias were adjusted.
