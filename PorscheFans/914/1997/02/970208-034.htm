Hi Gerard,

I would guess you have lost the service of at least one cylinder.
It would be impossible to say what the cause is.   Perhaps you
fouled a spark plug, lost a plug wire, or something like that.   Or
you might have an ignition problem.

The shaking suggests uneven power production, and you certainly
have lost some power.   I would start the search by pulling the plugs
and comparing them.   If  you find a bad one, go from there.

Good luck.

Dave
