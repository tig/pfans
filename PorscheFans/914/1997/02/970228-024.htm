Well, it was bound to happen. I always knew it would.
I was cruising along happily at about 10 pm, when suddenly my throttle 
stayed wide open. I had just pulled away from a set of lights, so it was 
wide open. I switched off the ignition, and coasted to a nicely placed 
and well lit car park.

After pulling off the air-cleaner, I closed the throttle by hand, and 
thats when the cable actualy snapped. Did I have a spare? Of course not!
But I did remember reading on the list about people having this problem. 
So I pulled out the 6 foot audio cable that I had just bought, tied it to 
the remains of the throttle cable, and opened my window to use my new 
hand throttle. it was awkward, but it worked.

I might never have thought to do it this way if I hadn't read about it on 
the list, so to whoever posted the original article, thanks.

And yes, I'll buy two.
