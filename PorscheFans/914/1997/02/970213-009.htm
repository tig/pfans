>I'm still in the midst of converting my '73 to a /6.  Right now,
I'm working on refurbishing the interior, and have it gutted.  I
plan on recoating the inside with POR15, or maybe just some primer
and black Rustoleum, and am wondering if...... Trimed.......  Any
comments?<

Mike, Just check for loose sealer, or any where you see rust creep under the
edge of the sealer.  Other wise you will disturbe some of the cleanest metal you
have ever seen.  And then you start to wonder why the factory just does not
cover the interior car in this stuff.  Might I suggest white, instead of black.
It is a lot easier to track down potental problems on a white piece of metal,
black hides all sort of stuff.

>I had also planned on welding in some chassis reinforcements.  At first,
I was going to weld a set of longitudinal stiffeners (Brad Mayeur's kit),
and a GT rear stiffening kit.  A local guy is going to build a cage with
four welded mounts to the floor; the cage will bolt together into this,
and also bolt into the seat belt mounts in the targa bar.  I started
thinking about this, and wonder if the longitudinal stiffeners are
necessary given that I think the cage will add substantial reinforcement?
Also, has anyone used Rich Johnson's GT kit?.... sniped again.....<

I will get to see Rich's kit next week if all goes as planned, Don Hanney had
rave reviews, and in talking to Rich, I decided to give up on mine.  Which is a
duplicate of the factory, I think, who knows now.  Rich's sounds really nice
14ga steel, which is coated to prevent rust, in a weld friendly coating.  Also
you will want to set the car level, measure all the chassis pionts, make sure it
is straight.  Then you will want to take the doors off, and make a jig to hold
the door space exactly to spec.  Once this is done you may continue welding
useing percations to make sure not to get to much heat in one area. Also use a
easy grind wire if you like to clean up your work.  You were planning on doing
the longitudinal stiffeners they may not be nessicary, but only if your cage has
a good tight fit.  It will provide support, and stiffness, but only if it fits
tight to the chassis.  Also check the rule books to see how many attachment
pionts you are allowed to the chassis, and use all of them.  Also remeber not to
scimp on tubing guage and strength, this is not the place to use exhaust tubing.
Most sactioning bodies will require a inspection hole, but it is your life.  And
yes I have seen exhaust tubing roll bars at the local roundy rounds, BOY the
make a nice ball when hit.

>And finally, the steel GT flares are almost on; they are trimmed, and ready
to be tacked in this weekend.  The car is currently rolling on some 7x15's
and 8x15's Fuchs which fill (front) and overfill (rear) the wheelwells.
They look incredibly beefy right now, but look very undersized with the
flares in place (maybe 1-1.5" recess).  I'd like to bump the wheels out
further in the wheelwells to give a more filled out appearance, without
having to buy a new set of wider wheels.  I will secretly confide that
this is for personal cosmetic reasons, but will publicly rationalize that
this is to improve the car's track...=8^)<

Uhh, that is why the orginally ran the flare was to widen the track.  Just
because you can stuff 11" in the rear does not me you should.  11" wheels with
the same cross section tire have a huge rolling resistance, and aerodynamic
resistance.  But "GT" flares are not very aerodynamic either. :-0  Have no idea
as to which spacer to use, but remebr to check the rules to see what your max
track is allowed to be.

>Thanks for any advice/tips; I'll go back to my cave now...<

Just my 0.000002 worth, enjoy the work.

Stephen Jacobs
