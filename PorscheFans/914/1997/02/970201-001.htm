Here's my .02 cents again.
 I have bought from AA before and  had mixed feelings about buy from AA
(sorry Jason) again. But never the less I ordered a set of the new repo
PORSCHE letter set from then because they where cheaper. As a little
bonus I received a speach from the salesman about how great AA is
compared to other companys, something about partys and beer ??the guy 
was a little off. Jason finished off the call and was very helpful. I'll
let you know the quality of the Items if interested ? When ever they get
here, God knows how long and much it will be this time.
 
 Did you ship them yet Jason ?? tell me the truth, come on ; )

  Have fun ordering those parts , its a jungle out there  8 )

       Don
