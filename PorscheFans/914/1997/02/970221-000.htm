A few folks have asked about the seat belts, so here's the scoop:

They are available from

P.rofessionally E.ngineered Products
1119-A Los Olivos Ave.
Los Osos, CA 93402-3232

(805)528-7888; 9-7 M-Th, 9-5 Friday

Ask for Lucas.

I believe that the Kit is called KT106, and that you need two, one per seat.
They cost either $175 or $130 each--I have conflicting data.
Be sure you get them to supply bolts (at least for everything but the reels).


I bought a pair. The reels bolt in by your shoulder, the receivers bolt in
by your old receivers, the end of the belt bolts in where the old belt bolted
in to the floor. In other words--a simple bolt in project.

BUT

The parts that bolt to the "floor" need to pivot, and the holes in them
do not work with your old shouldered bolts. You can buy new, non-shouldered
high-strength bolts at Orchard Supply. These work fine for the reels
(you might want to also use some high-strength washers on them, also available
at Orchard). And I think Lucas will supply bolts and hardware for the
swiveling parts.
(He didn't at first, I told him of my problems, then he sent them, and new
receivers
at no cost--I was impressed. He said he intended to include the hardware
with the kit
in the future.)

The other BUT is that I like to turn the buckles the other way from how he
supplies them. It seems to me that his orientation is optimized to keep the
belts
untwisted when they are hanging, but it me it is more important to
minimize the twist from reel to shoulder when you are wearing the belt.
So I got my narrow dremel grinding tool, ground out a little of the plastic
in the
slot the webbing went through in the buckle, and did the old half-twist the
belt and
slide the buckle trick to turn it around.
If you ask him, he can mount the buckle the other way when he puts the set
together for you.

Anyway, I am happy with the finished result, and impressed with the
vendor's responsibility.
Sorry if the description above is confusing, it's not easy to write this
sort of thing
clearly!

- Dave

PS: I believe that the reels have only a centrifugal sensor, not a vehicle
acceleration one, but I might be wrong.
