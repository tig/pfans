The 914's were built in the Karman factory, as I recall, and they were
built to higher standard than the VW's of the time, as has been my
experience. They also seem to be better built than the 2002s of the same
time period, if that matters. (I've noted that the 2002 has some sharp 
corners in the sheetmetal in the fender wells that usually get blasted by 
tire grit and rust out, allowing water to get into the rockers and rust 
them out also. The 914 has nice smooth sheetmetal in the fender wells 
that avoid this problem, mostly) 

Are there flaws in the 914 design? Sure, we talk about them all the time
on this list (the battery location being the biggest that I can recall
right now), but the interchangeability of parts with the 911 (mostly
suspension, steering and brakes) tells me that the 914 is more Porsche
than Volkswagen. Besides, the whole thing about making fun of someone
else's car just shows the accuser's insecurity regarding thier own car. 

I'm proud of my 914, and I'm impressed everytime I jack up one corner and 
the doors and hoods close and open normally. They'll have to pry my cold, 
dead fingers off the steerign wheel before I give up this car.
