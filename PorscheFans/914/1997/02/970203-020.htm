Since you were cc'd on my email to AutoAtlanta regarding the fiberglass front 
bumper I bought from them (along with over $700 worth of other stuff), I 
thought you deserve to hear how the saga turned out.

The next day after that email (addressed to ghussey@autoatlanta.com), Sean 
contacted me and authorized a return (the only transaction that was prompt).  
I UPS'd it (and had it packed by a local mailing store) for about $54.  Since 
I tracked the insured package via ups.com, I was able to tell them, "Your 
employee signed for it at 10:02am two days ago" when I called them (Seattle to 
Atlanta - no 1-800 number).

They hadn't looked at it yet, but promised to by the middle of the next week.  
By the end of that week, not having heard from them, I called (Seattle to 
Atlanta - no 1-800 number), spent 15 minutes on hold (typical), learned that 
Sean was "out to lunch" (no comment), and that they'd call me back (when I 
wouldn't be there, most likely).  A few weeks later, I finally heard that they 
knew there was a batch of about 10 front bumpers that weren't shaped correctly 
- they were made during race season, after all - and a couple of them had come 
back.  Mine was probably one of those.

So, Sean said he'd have his supplier make a new mold and a new bumper for me.  
About a month elapsed without contact.  I emailed straywick@autoatlanta.com 
for a status report. Trustingly, I asked, "When was the bumper shipped?"  By 
reply I learned that it had not been and that it would take "a while" longer 
to be made.

Several weeks later, I emailed for status again, and got two options: continue 
to wait (no estimate how long) or have my charge card account credited.  I 
chose the latter, and asked to have my (return to them) shipping costs as well 
as the shipping costs originally charged to me for the defective bumper 
refunded.  A couple of days later, I had their answer.  Since I had been 
inconvenienced, they would refund the cost of the bumper ($145) "immediately" 
and would post a $30 credit for the initial shipping to my AA account for 
application to a future order.  This "special treatment" mad no mention of the 
cost I incurred to get the defective bumper back to them.

I accepted, though, and began checking my charge card "balance" online.  About 
a week and a half after it was supposed to be posted, I called (still long 
distance, still on hold) and learned that it would be done - you guessed it - 
that very day!  It seems George got confused and someone waited ten days for 
the fog to clear.

Almost true to their word (assuming "immediately" really means "in about two 
weeks if you remember to bug us about it"), the credit did finally show up on 
my account, and I assume I have a $30 credit with AA for that future purchase 
I'm just dying to make.

All together, the defective front bumper (which I no longer have) cost me:
 $145 (original cost) 
+ $30 (original shipping) 
+ $54 (insurance, return packing and shipping) 
+ $16 (minimum, in long distance phone calls) 
- $145 (credit, over two months after returning the item) 
or about $100 if I DON'T order from them in the future.  If I do, the $30 
credit becomes about $22 when you factor in the cost of the shipping of that 
"next" order, so I'd only be out $70 for the honor of being one of their long 
time and fairly substantial customers.

Would I recommend them to others?  Maybe, but not to anyone who expects prompt 
service and quality merchandise.
