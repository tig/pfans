A couple of weeks ago I asked for the wisdom of the list on my brake =
project and got some good answers on brake lines and where to get them - =
Stoddard was the overwhelming answer - thanks.
I didn't get an answer to the hard question, so I need to ask again.  =
I'm putting an Automotion proportioning valve in a '76.  The valve has =
fittings in the same locations as the earlier (pre mid '74 I think) =
valve.  I'm not sure I can use the early lines since I don't know if the =
early and late valves mount in the same place.  The late valve mounts on =
a welded-on bracket with studs, where it looks like the early valve =
mounts with two bolts going into something.
I measured the location of the mounting studs in relation to the hole in =
the firewall for the shifter (which I don't think has been changed), and =
am hoping someone can do the same on an earlier car (with the "T" at the =
top of the prop valve).
From the center of the shift rod hole, the center of the lower mounting =
bolt for the prop valve is up about 5 1/2", and to the left about 2 =
1/8".  Can anyone get measurements for an early car?

TIA
Andy
