This February marks the one year anniversary of my 914 ownership.  When
I bought the car, the engine had just been rebuilt, and had 500 miles on
it.  Shortly after buying the car, the tranny shift rod disconnected
itself while cruising down the highway, leaving me stuck in 4th gear.
An 8 cent bolt fixed that problem.  Shortly thereafter, I washed the car
at one of those automatic car washes, and the cold water on the hot
hoses split one of the fuel lines.  A 50 cent piece of hose fixed that.
About a month later, the smog pump pulley decided that it no longer
needed to remain attached to the fan, and sheared off smashing the
alternator and leaving me stranded once again.  2000 miles later,
compression in all four cylinders dropped to 70 psi, and it was time for
a top-end rebuild.  One month later, the car was back on the road with
new rings, freshly honed cylinders, freshly lapped valve seats, and new
valve guides.  After the rebuild, I was never able to get the exhaust to
seal against the heads properly, so the car always backfired.  It took 5
months to get the exhaust sealed properly (Use studs, NOT bolts.  Also,
use the copper nuts).  Shortly thereafter, the head temp sensor failed.
For a while, the car was quite reliable, but then white smoke began to
appear from the exhaust, and during a compression test to find out which
valve I failed to adjust properly, the valve seat dropped rendering the
car disabled.  Currently, it sits in my parking lot under a foot of
snow.  Fortunately in 3 days I get a garage, and the heads will be
shipped off to Stephen's for new valve seats.  Hopefully within the next
two months the yellow beast will be back on the road.  The funny thing
(and I know everyone on this list will agree) is that no matter how much
trouble this car has been, I wouldn't EVER consider selling it, and I
consider it to be one of the best things I've ever spent my money and
time on.  Five minutes of driving make a month's worth of work instantly
worth while.  I would not recommend the 914 to someone that doesn't like
to work on their own cars, nor to someone that "thinks" that they "may"
like Porsches.  It's a strange bond that's difficult to explain, but I
wouldn't trade it for anything.
