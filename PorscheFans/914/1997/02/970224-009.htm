This is a good list....but I found some more things while doing my
two conversions.  (Stick with the 914 trans)

8) wiring harness mods
9) 911 starter (914 starter was too weak)
10) 911 clutch - 1970??? (can't remember)
11) Custom shift linkage

However, the most important thing you need is a good, solid
car.  Fix the rust first.

I'm not sure what other people have experienced, but even with
my first conversion (2.4 mag case and 914 trans) my car was
dragging its ass on the ground.  Even when I installed Boge
sport shocks and Troutman 165lb springs.  Yes, those would
make the car lower than stock...but my car was much too
low with the extra weight of the 911 engine.

The problem was made worse with the new 3.0 aluminum
engine and 915 trans.

The solution was to use the Koni setup with the adjustable
rear spring perches and 180lb springs.  With the adjustable
spring perches I can set the rear ride height whereever I
want.

One last piece of advice....these cars are FAST and can
get you in lots of trouble.  I strongly feel that when a 911
engine goes in a 914 - the brakes and suspension should
be upgraded too.  This will naturally lead to 911 wheels
and perhaps flares and a paint job.  Factor this into your
conversion budget before you begin.

Good luck!
