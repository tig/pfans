Yes, the power to compress the incoming air to get the advertised 6 lb 
boost has to come from somewhere.  Mostly it will come from the 
battery, as it will draw up to 95 amps (2hp).  The battery will 
recharge after you let off the boost, so this is borrowed power.  Of 
course this won't be much good going up Pike's Peak at WOT, or much 
good in a truck, but it seems ideal for our cars that can mostly use 
just short spurts of extra power.

I am trying to get a pre-production model from a friend with the co., 
so stay tuned.
