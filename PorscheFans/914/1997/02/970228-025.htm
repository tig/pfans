Hi 914-er's!

"  Just though I'd pass this along in case anyone is interested in 
better fuses.  In a Bob Hoover sermon......  he mentioned a glass  
Buss style fuse as a replacement for the plastic body and wire type 
that are also used in our  914s.......
.......I just ordered 50 of the Bussmann fuses. They are indeed much 
better than the el cheapo ones with the little wire outside the plastic 
body....  "

  Unfortunately, the problem with the European-style fuses is not with 
the design of the fuse, but with the design of the interface between 
the fuse and the fuse block, or holder.  The contact area is small, 
and the spring pressure is light.  In addition, the fact that the fusable 
material is actually used as the contact material is another weakness. 
European-style fuses are prone to dissimilar metal corrosion on the 
end connection points; this together with the overall weak design of 
the contact scheme results in chronic problems.
  Going to a glass-bodied fuse will address only one of these 
problems: that of the contact material on the fuse.  Glass-bodied 
fuses use "astro-plate", tin, or other similar material on the end 
contacts to improve electrical contact.  This is the only advantage 
that will be realized from a glass-bodied copy of a European-style 
fuse.  The small contact area and weak spring pressure will still be 
present, and potential sources of problems.  
  If you want to observe first-hand the REAL advantage of 
American-style fuses, simply compare the relative amount of force 
required to extract one from it's spring clips, compared to the effort to 
remove a 914 fuse.  The only way to really solve the problem is to 
replace the fuse block with an American-style unit.  I think that's more 
trouble than it's worth.
  When I worked for a Saab dealership years ago, we were able to 
get fairly good reliability out of the European-style fuses by simply 
spraying them with contact cleaner and rotating them in their clips at 
every 6000 mile service.  (We also re-bent any clips that seemed too 
loose.)  If one does the same for a 914, it should prove to have 
satisfactory reliability.
