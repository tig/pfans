Hay 914ers....I have a slight twist to pass on about alloy calipers on 914-6s
and 914-4s convrted to 911 5-lug struts.  All calipers have some flex.  Add
larger than stock master cylinders and improved SS lines and that added
pressure can also increase flex with the calipers.  The early 911 "S" caliper
is actually pretty good.  Under real hard track use, without cooling, they
will probably become less effective.  The tendance to have the "S" caliper
spread (flex) when heated make them work much less efficiently.
The new "twist" is that the new version of the Porsche alloy caliper is a
tremedous improvement over the "S" calipers.  Brembo has produced a very good
product suitable for street and track.  Alloy bodied calipers with coated
alloy pistons (supposed to have a longer life expectancy that Phylis Diller)
in alloy bores solve most of Porsches problems with their ATE predacessors.
 The structural integrity is also much greater taking experience from Brembos
racing programs where they build calipers for everything from Winston Cup
cars to the Porsche racing program.  The installation of the Brembos on 914s
with "S" struts is very easy.  Mating them to earlier Boge struts is more
complicated and expensive.  They do make an awsome difference and in my
opinion are worth every penny.  

Take care everybody....Rich
'71 914-6, 3.0L (with Porsche Brembos)
