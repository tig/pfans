Don, George, and all

It is important for all of us to understand that George is in business and 
that means that he must make a pretty good profit on what he sells to stay in 
business (Pay employees, adds, catalogs, and phones). What we did was take our 
collective time and research and locate a book, pay for it in advance, and 
wait for the ship to get here.

We did it because it was fun, a sort of how do I do that experience that is 
just well suited to people who drive cars that only they can make work, and 
that don't really work well in winter so we needed a cold weather project.

I figure it cost me about $500 of time and effort to pull the book buy off, 
and I would do it again because it was fun, but I did not need to make the 
money to pay the rent. Given 40 books that cost would have raised the cost by 
$12 each, and that's just cost no profit. 

George has built a business around our cars, and without his business we might 
not be able to get some of the things we do. Even if we don't get them from 
him.

So let's lay off him, if his prices are not for you, so be it.

I buy lots of parts from Zims for the '44, I don't even ask the $'s, I just 
know I will get what I ordered on time, and that's good for me. I don't 
question them making a profit, because without it they would not be there to 
answer the phone.
