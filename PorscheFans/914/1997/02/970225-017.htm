Also regarding the original question of 8" wheels, does anyone have any
experience with the 944T 8X16" Fuchs? They have the same offset (23.3mm)
as the 7" 911 Fuchs. As far as the fender is concerned, I would imagine
they would fit with rolling/slight flaring as with the 911 7 inchers.
The extra inch is all inboard. I wonder if there would be rubbing of the
trailing arm. Forgeline advertises an 8" which will fit under stock
fenders, but I've never seen any backspacing/offset data. It would be
nice to squeeze 215s or 225s in the back.

On an unrelated question, does anyone know if someone sources a rubber
replacement for chrome trim around the windshield? I get quite a bit of
noise at the A pillar at speed and wonder if the trim doesn't
contribute.

Gary.
