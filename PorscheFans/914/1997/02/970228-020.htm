I agree; I'm glad he's around, and that I can find things available through him
if I need to.  And I think he should be free to charge what he wants for his goods;
I don't have to buy from him if I think its high.
But the shipping charges really need to get under control.  $21 for shipping
a w/s seal and some side/targa seals is way excessive, even if in 2 boxes.
That should be an overnighted rate, not for an ~1-2week wait.  I don't think
shipping should be used as a profit source; it should be reflected in the
price of the parts....
