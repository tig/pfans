	When I asked about how to stop my seatbelts from "sticking",
I got a nice procedure from the Tech Tips section of SVR's web page
(http://www.vpm.com/pca-svr/).
	Unfortunately, the problem that my belts were having was not
the same one that the author of the article had fixed.  He described
how to move the acceleration-sensor mechanism so that it did not
latch when you didn't want it to.  My problem was that the centri-
fugal ratcheting mechanism was too sensitive.  A guess is that the
spring inside the centrifugal bit has started to lose its sproing.
	After looking at things for a while and wondering what I
could do, I remembered the pair of belts that I'd bought at a swap
meet about three years ago and stuck away in a box.  I checked them,
and they both worked a lot better than the ones on my car.  And yes,
I checked both the centrigual and acceleration stops, and they all
work.
	So I installed them.  Now I almost have an interior again--
yaaay!  I just need to put the screws in the bottom of the backpad,
and vaccuum the bits of window seal out of...  Well, everywhere.
	Many thanks to Mike, to "Wayne" (whomever he is), and to
Dennis, for pointing me in their direction!
	When I get time, maybe I'll take apart my old seatbelts and
see what the inside looks like.  (Don't hold your breath waiting!)

[A:]  PPPPBBBBBBLLTTT!
