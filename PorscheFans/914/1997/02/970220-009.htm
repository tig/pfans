Hi Pfans - thought this exchange might be of some interest.

Hi Mike:
>>I just saw your car for the first time, on Tim's web page.

Mike replies,

RD replies again,
That's a good bit of info.  I do know that factory wheels are made as 
light as possible - within budget, of course.  Roadhandling for racing 
also has to be improved if you can lower the unsprung weight, just as 
it helps on the boulevard.  Yes, mine is a commuter, and I like a soft 
ride.  I have red Konis set to softest, and no sway bar.  Sheepskins 
are the large factor, also.

All I know is that an early Riviera mag weighs 16 lb . . .

Mike continues:
>That's a 5.5" rim.  If you could weigh a stock 5.5" steel wheel and

>My WAG is that my 7" alums are 18 lbs. and the 7" steels are 20 lbs.
>So, if weight is the only criterion, go with 5.5" Centerlines (they're

>design.  Fill them with helium, for good measure; just don't try to 
>follow me into any corners!

rd rambles on:
I would not know what centerlines looked like if I were run over by 
one.  Gotta find a pict of one.  Good idea about fabric cord. 

Mike adds:
The Centerlines I mentioned were for a Neon ACR so the size was 14x6, 
but they felt hollow when lifted without a tire around them.  Their 
design was a fairly simple, almost flat center with about 15 1" 
diameter round holes in a circle between the bolt circle and the rim.  

rd continues,
BTW, one of my friends is chief pilot on the Goodyear Blimp.  We were 
discussing helium last week, and he said it is only $.15 per cu ft, so 
that would sure be cheap to do.  Now I just need to calculate how much 
weight it would save.

I think this discussion is of general interest.  Mind if I post it to 
the group?

OK
