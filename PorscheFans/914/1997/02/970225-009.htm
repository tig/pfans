This will make a purist blanche, so turn around if you have a weak stomach....
At the suggestion of a fellow lister (I wish I could remember who it was; if you
see this, please drop me a line), I went to a junkyard last weekend looking
for power window motors to use in my 914.  The info I got was that early 80's
Nissan's had a cable window regulator similar to VW's (i.e. similar to 914's),
and that the motor could be attached in place of the crank assembly.  Well,
I went scouring around, and found some motors out of a '81 Maxima that will
mesh perfectly with the later scissor style regulators.  But I couldn't find
one to match the old cable style regulator.

So, (get on with the point, Mike) does anyone know model Nissan's (or any other
make) had power windows and cable regulators?  I'm willing to hunt around more
if I have a starting point.  Also, is there anyway to retrofit '74 scissor style
regulators into a '73 door (they don't have the same mounting holes drilled)?

And while I have your attention, is anyone interested in a used but mint
(no cracks/scratches) black dashtop or OEM foglights?  I plan on adding
instruments to the dash, but do not want to cut up a perfect dash (I've got
a trashed one I can use), and plan to put in PIAA foglights anyway.

Thanks,
Mike
