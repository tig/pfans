Thanks, Jim.  Since the heads should be the same on my 2.0L I'll figure the
long reach plugs are correct.

No electronic ignition yet, just stock coil and the .009 with
points/condenser.  So .028 should be correct.  I do have a Jacob's OmniPak
electronic ignition that I'll be putting on once have the stock FI back on.
I have an OmniPak on my Thing and like it.  Then I'll gap the plugs to .055
as the directions say.

The timing issue gets more muddy now.  Seems like I saw something about
this on one of the lists, will have to dig, and check the Hoover sermons.
Appreciate any advice from anyone though.

When I adjusted the valves this weekend I turned the fan till saw the 009
rotor almost line up with the mark on dist body for #1.  Then looked in fan
and got 0 mark on fan in the V notch.  The rotor was to the right
(clockwise) of the dist body mark which I assumed was about right for the
advance, notch would be about where it fired BTDC.  Adjusted valves,
checking to make sure they felt loose, so the dist. seemed to be about
right.

After adjusting valves and regapping plugs I went to check timing.  The fan
has a 0 and a white mark at TDC and a notch and red mark at what I assume
is the 27deg BTDC point, about 4 fan vanes before the TDC mark (Clockwise
rotation of the fan).  When I put the timing light on it though it looked
like at idle it was near the red mark and advanced from there.  Engine
seemed to run fine.

It was getting dark so I haven't been able to check farther but something
doesn't seem right.  Have I made any incorrect assumptions?  Since this was
a new rebuild (from PO) is it possible the dist drive gear was off one
tooth as I recall being mentioned in another post? I'm use to the Type 1
engine so is this something about the type 4?

Since I'll be putting a stock dist. back on when changing to the stock FI
system I want to know what is going on.  This weekend I'll be checking
more. Pull plugs and make sure the fan 0 mark is the TDC etc.  Any hints,
messages to look for, digests with threads about this subject?

Subject:  Re: Spark plug and timing question?




Greetings 914-er's!

 Jeff Lorentzen asks:

"  While checking out the new car over weekend I pulled the plugs
for first time......   It had Bosch W8DC plugs.  I'm use to the Type 1
engine, it has the short threaded plugs, These W8DC plugs have a
longer threaded end and I know if plugs are too long they can cause
hot spots from threads sticking into the combustion chamber or even
hit the piston.   Are these the normal length for a 914?   "

 I can't say about all 914's (someone else on the list want to jump
in?) but my '74 2.0 litre has long-reach plugs.

"   Also, the plugs were gapped at about .038 rather than the stock
..028, right now this engine has...... stock coil and plug wires, .009
distributor...... what gap...... "

 You don't say if the ignition system as a whole is still stock, or if it
has some sort of electronic upgrade, but if conventional
points-condensor, then I'd say .028".

"  and what kind of timing should this Weber/009 combination be set
to?   I recall the .009 has about 22 deg. of total advance.  Should
this engine still be set so it has the stock total advance 27deg BTDC
at 3500 RPM?   "

 That's how I'd do it.  Anyone else care to comment?


   Regards,
   Jim T.
