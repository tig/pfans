Just crawling out of the dark hovel that is my garage, to ask a few
more questions of everyone.....

I'm still in the midst of converting my '73 to a /6.  Right now,
I'm working on refurbishing the interior, and have it gutted.  I
plan on recoating the inside with POR15, or maybe just some primer
and black Rustoleum, and am wondering if I need to strip out all the
original seam sealer, etc before putting down the paint, or if I can
just go over it.  Currently, the interior metal is in good shape
(except for some rust in the center tunnel).  I'm mainly doing this to
spiff it, and would rather not remove all the sealer, etc., as I'm sure
the factory did a better job than I can.  I'm not planning on going
to bare metal; just to scuff the old paint and apply the new (except
for removing the original sound deadner in the footwells).  Any
comments?

I had also planned on welding in some chassis reinforcements.  At first,
I was going to weld a set of longitudinal stiffeners (Brad Mayeur's kit),
and a GT rear stiffening kit.  A local guy is going to build a cage with
four welded mounts to the floor; the cage will bolt together into this,
and also bolt into the seat belt mounts in the targa bar.  I started
thinking about this, and wonder if the longitudinal stiffeners are
necessary given that I think the cage will add substantial reinforcement?
Also, has anyone used Rich Johnson's GT kit?  That is the one I am thinking of
going with.  I feel pretty competent as a welder, but am worried about
properly aligning the chassis when welding the reinforcement; I don't
want to permanently reinforce the chassis in a crooked position.  Any
suggestions how to make sure everything is square?  Also, while I'm
in there, is there any way to reinforce the tab that supports the inner
swingarm pivot.  It is a rather spindly looking thing, and I don't think
any of the reinforcement kits do anything to support it.  I was wondering
if there was any sort of bracket or something to beef it up (I'm
using some boxed trailing arms with the 911 e-brake conversion, and these
puppies are *heavy*  Yes, I know this is unsuspended weight, etc.....)

And finally, the steel GT flares are almost on; they are trimmed, and ready
to be tacked in this weekend.  The car is currently rolling on some 7x15's
and 8x15's Fuchs which fill (front) and overfill (rear) the wheelwells.
They look incredibly beefy right now, but look very undersized with the
flares in place (maybe 1-1.5" recess).  I'd like to bump the wheels out
further in the wheelwells to give a more filled out appearance, without
having to buy a new set of wider wheels.  I will secretly confide that
this is for personal cosmetic reasons, but will publicly rationalize that
this is to improve the car's track...=8^)  The suspension is Carrera front
struts and SC rear hubs.  I was thinking of buying a set of spacers from
Automotion while they are still on sale.  Are these spacers (~1"-1.5")
safe to use, and will the resulting offset be okay and not cause undue
stress on the rest of the suspension?  The car will mainly be street driven,
with the ocasional track day and autox.

Thanks for any advice/tips; I'll go back to my cave now...
Mike
