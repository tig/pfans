that I need to loosen the 3 bolts anchoring the outer mount of the swing

the
other and end up with a car going down the road like a dog (you know,
part sidways). Right now the rear is toed out 1/8". I would like 1/16" =
toe in.

Does anyone on the list know a do it yourself method for adjusting the
toe on the rear suspension accurately?>

Hi Ben, welcome to a list with no karts or classing threads!

The hard part is getting a good reference to measure from.  You could =
measure out from the car's centerline, but it's hard to be sure you've =
got the centerline.  I measure from the suspension mounting points =
(doesn't matter where exactly, just use the same spot on both sides of =
the car) out to about 6" outside the tires in the front and rear.  Once =
you've marked these two spots on either side of the car, measure between =
the marks across the car, front and rear.  Chances are the measurements =
won't be the same.  Take half the difference and either move the wider =
one in, or the narrower one out, on both sides.  You then have 2 points =
on each side of the car which can be used to draw lines parallel to the =
centerline of the car.  Use a sharp pencil and stretch a thread between =
the marks to get things accurate.  Don't bother drawing it the whole =
length of the car, just the area near the rear wheels.  You can now =
measure from front and rear of each rear wheel/tire to the line on =
either side of the car to determine what your toe is on that side.

Let me know if this rambling isn't clear, I'll try again in a private =
post.
