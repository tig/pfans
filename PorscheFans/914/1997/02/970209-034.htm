Concerning the REPEATING MESSAGES:
I have looked at the messages in depth. There is a loop embedded into the
message as they are called for receiving new mail.
1st They are received from ???@???
2nd The message is received from www.ioio.com to your personal user mail
retriever at your home location.
3rd The messages are received from hupa.snfc21.pbi.net by
www.porschefans.com(NTList)... All of us....
4th The messages are received from miavx1.acs.muohio.edu by hupa.snfc21.pbi.net
5th The messages are received from miavx1.acs.muohio.edu by
miavx1.acs.muohio.edu

All these messages are then CC to:
Porschefans-911, 356, 924-944, 928, 914, Boxter@porschefans and the one that
I suspect is the loop quattro@coimbra.ans.net which has been appended since
the 1st message appeared. If this is not the source, then the
SYSTEM@miavxi.acs.muohio.edu is haywired.

Anyone know how to stop the loop, please do. Whatever you do, DO NOT append
Porshays@aol.com to message base. It will only keep repeating.

DO NOT CHANGE THE SUBJECT LINE OF BLACK HOLE OR INSERT THE DRV. EDU subject
there. Working together as we do on our particular model of Porsche, we can
repair this damn Avalanche of unwanted mail.
