I prefer Ferrodo pads myself very quite, some dust, but GRIP, and that
they do well.  Much better than Metal Masters, the only hard choice is
which compound to get.  The 3497 street compound or the 3466 race
compound.  I suggest the street compound
if the car is a daily driver.  Both will work on the street and both work
well as an Auto-x car, the track pads are the only choice if you are
going to be tracking the car.  Both of these pads have about the same
coefficient of Drag as a Carbon pad, but are a little more friendly on
the rotors.  The difference over a stock type pad or the metal masters is
mind boggling, IMHO.  I have also used Cool Carbons, PFCs, and Hawks, and
these by far give me the best of all worlds in street driving.  The Hawks
would stop the fastest, but eat rotors faster than pad.  The PFCs and
Cool Carbons, seemed to sacrifice both pad and rotor at an equal amount. 
We will see how the Ferrodo do with rotors, but I think judging from the
rotors current condition they are friendly.

BTW, GPR does not carry them, I got mine from Velocity, but these are on
a VW currently.  I am planning on calling to see, if they can get them
for the 914.  Tweeks also carried Ferrodo in the past, don't know if they
still do.

Take care,
