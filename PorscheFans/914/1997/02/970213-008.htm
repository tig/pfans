I came up with a system that I think adresses the problems of this design. 
It is, as far as I can tell, pretty unique, as I have never see it on any
914s.

The whole problem revolves around rigidizing the inner suspension "tab", as
you call it. More precisely, it's the point at which the nut pinches the
tab against the trailing arm's  (TA's) internal shaft, the one with
threaded ends.

Reinforcing the tab itself doesn't really make that much sense, because if
you could rigidize that _inner_nut_, then the whole thing would stop
flexing, period.

If you're with me so far, then here goes ...

(This required removing the motor, sheet-metal fab, cutting, welding, lathe
work, mill work, and internal threading of Stainless Steel -- IOW, a lot of
work).

I did the following, with the engine out of the car.  This pertains to a
914-4, so there may be clearance issues for the 914-6.

First, I welded a small plate with an appropriately-located hole in the
recess of the tab, towards the inside of the engine compartment. It's
kind-of U-shaped, but the U is solid (except for the hole). Cleaned up the
weld with grinding, etc. This gives three sheet's worth of metal in the
tab.

Then I drilled a 3/4" hole through the existing hole,
_enlarging_it_substantially_.  Note that now you cannot use the old nut to
hold the swingarm in place, as 1) the hole is now way too big, and 2) the
added plate thickness reduces the available threads on the shaft. Then I
used a 1 1/4" (1 1/2"? I don't remember) spot facer with a 3/4" pilot to
give me a nice, large, perpendicular, flat area for my new nut (below) to
fit against.

Now, I made a special part (the first of many).  It's made of Stainless
Steel (forgot the grade, sorry) but SS was explicitly chosen for its
properties -- strong but with a little give.  This is a fancy "nut", that
is internally threaded for the TA's threaded shaft end (M14 x 1.5, I
think).  This nut has a 3/4" diameter, maybe 1/4" long end which passes
through that 3/4" hole I made, and it now has a very large (1 1/4" diameter
surface) shoulder to clamp against the tab. Next, the 1 1/4" daimeter
continues for 3/4", and then there's a 19mm hex at the end.  The whole nut
is about 2" long, maximally 1 1/4" in diameter, and heavy. It's very
pretty, too :-)

OK, what this gives us is a nice big 1 1/4" diameter, 3/4" wide journal
where the flats of the original nut were.  Our flats our 3/4" further
towards the engine compartment -- in the case of the 914-4, they're very
close to the valve covers. This is a large, strong surface area that is
rigidly connected to the tab and the TA. It is a snug fit in the tab, and
it rigidly locates the inside of the TA without any threads touching the
body of the car, preventing them from cutting into the tab and enlarging
that hole (which happens in the 914). This is a critical point -- without a
shouldered nut, the design will always dig into the hole at the tab and
enlarge it over time.  With a 3/4 shoulder, the area is much bigger, and
it's a round peg in a round hole, not a threaded rod in a round hole!

Now, for the next fancy part. This is made  of aluminum, and it sort of has
two halves -- the lower half is just like an aluminum rod end (big end),
and it goes around the fancy nut and is clamped to that nut just like a rod
is clamped to a crank, only it doesn't move.  The other end is angled to
make it parallel to the long axis of the car when mounted to the tab (the
tab is at an angle). The angles are complex. At this end there's a
cross-bolt and a trough, where a rod end goes, supported by the cross-bolt
in double shear.

Next part is a Cromoly tube, roughly 12" long, with rh and lh nuts welded
at the ends, and rod ends (lh and rh) installed. Looks like an IndyCar
suspension piece.

The last collection of parts are a mounting point for the other rod end,
which fits into a dimple / depression in the lower firewall directly and
about 18" ahead of the tab.  There's an aluminum piece on the engine side,
that accepts the rod end.  There's a bracket on the floor of the passenger
compartment that braces the before-mentioned aluminum piece from the other
side of the firewall.


So what's the point?  Well, the bracket(s) on and around the firewall are
permanently installed.  The fancy nut stays in place unless it interferes
with the removal of the engine.  The Cromoly tube is easily removed just by
unbolting it. The part that clamps to the fancy nut is easily removed, and
needs to be to gain access to the valve covers to adjust the valves, etc.
So, IMHO, it's elegant, but it takes a fair amount of machining to make the
parts.  It's also pretty light -- the fancy nut is by far the heaviest
part.

What's great about it is that it directs the force at the nut (which is
mainly horizontal, along the long axis of the car) directly into the lower
firewall, which is pretty strong at that dimple point (two layers of steel,
plus the bracket bolted to the floor). All the other solutions I've seen
seek to avoid this flexing by beefing things up -- but they're really
bypassing the central problem with a brute-force approach that can only
indirectly reduce the flexing.

I did this 'cause I found a 3" crack in the rhs tab a day before a PCA TT
race.  And no, it took me a lot longer than a day to come up with this
solution. After the work is done, a rear-end alignment is required, of
course.

Maybe it's time for another TechTip ... :-(
