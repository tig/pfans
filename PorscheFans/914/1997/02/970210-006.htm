	Remember, to "assume" is to make an "ass" out of "u" and "me".  The
real deal appears to be that the PFans mailer is having problems.  Not AOL,
not Ray and George.  It will do NO GOOD AT ALL to scream and yell at those
two (plus the three respondents to Ray who have gotten caught in the same
loop).  They aren't the problem.  They aren't advertising anything--those
messages are simply announcements of local PCA events.
	Someone else already noticed that the addresses of the repeating
messages have something in common--they are addressed to "PorscheFans-xxx@
porschefans.com", rather than just "xxx@porschefans.com".  So make SURE the
address you send stuff to is the right one, OK?
	I have it on authority that "someone" has been working on the problem
for a full week so far, but (as we can all see) unsuccessfully.

	Now, what can we all do?  Well, we can waste bandwidth carping about
all the bandwidth that's getting wasted.  We can abuse people who are NOT
responsible for the problems (shame on you for even mentioning it, Jebby!).
We can unsubscribe until the problem gets straightened out.  We can ignore
the problem.  Some folks can set up mail filters that automagically trash
the two problem messages.  Or we could hold our breaths until we turn purple
and pass out.  Hey, it's your choice.
	I assume (there's that word again!) that the people on this list are
adult enough to act in a reasonable fashion.
	So, have we had enough yet?
