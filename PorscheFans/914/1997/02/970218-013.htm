Mike,

On mine I had to take the unit out of the car.  Put it in a vice, and
liquid wrench the heck out of it.  Then a big breaker bar, and lots of
muscle.  It finally came out off the mount it self.  Then I had to drive
the bolt out of the trunk bracket.  You will notice the bolt is covered
in corrosion, from years of lack of lube.  Not your fault it is the
design.  Next you will want to proceed using your usual skill level I
know you have.  Also notice that piece has possibly torn a hole into the
sheet metal to the wheel well.  It is only held on by six spot welds, if
memory is correct.

BTW, I fixed mine permanently,(I Think?) buy adding a grease zirk into
the head of the bolt, drilling down part way.  Adding a channel round the
exterior ( bushing area) of the bolt.  And then drilling two feed
channels into the bolt.  Now I can pump it full of grease every now and
again, and hopefully, not ever have to do this again.  Not my idea, was
done in Pano a long time ago, now reprinted in one of the Upfix books.

Take care,

Stephen Jacobs
