Porschenauts,
Several years ago, I sold one of my 74 914 2.0 to a local person. About a
year later he called me and asked if I would like to see what he had done.
What he had done, was to replace the 2.0 with a Corvette engine, 367 I
believe it was, and had mounted marine quad carbs. He had ordered a kit to
accomodate the conversion link up of the 914 transmission.
In the cockpit, there was absolute quiet as the engine came to life. An
uncanny resonance was felt, more of a vibration than usual, but still quiet.
This was very disturbing through the 1st three gears, but beyond that it was
the thrill of a lifetime in a 914. It was very fast.
He later  told my son that it peaked the 150mph rather fast and still had
reserve. 
I then sold him another 914 that I had which had the steel flares to fly in
the same manner. This was my last contact with him. He said this one would
be for his brother.
So if you are looking at speed as your goal in a 914, you might try this
conversion. You will have to cut metal to apply this conversion and beef up
the structure. Does not comply with regulations for Porsche related events.
The person who did this has since moved so I cannot supply any futher info
other than his name. Barry Buckingham.  He is somewhere in western
Tennessee. I think his cost of transformation was close to $3000.
