Josh - I don't at all mind anyone going faster than I do on the street
or freeway as long as they're safe; it's when they pass just to cut in
front of me that gets old... Seems sometimes like they have something to
prove.

It's the "if" part that isn't clear to me. I'd love to hear from someone
who's done the 3.6 conversion. I think you need to cut away some of the
sheet metal (?trunk, firewall) to make it go. I'd really like to avoid
this. Also mating the 901 with the dual-mass flywheel is a mystery to
me. I know the 3.2 can be a very clean nearly-stock install, with some
creative plumbing on the intake side and an early clutch disk/PP to mate
the tranny.
