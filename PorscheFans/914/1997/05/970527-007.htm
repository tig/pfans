I was the first one to flame him.  And I'd do it again.  As I stated
originally, if you've got a list of 700 parts and 697 of them are for
911's, don't post the whole friggin parts list to a 914 group with a
copy going to each individual's mail as well!  If he wants to compile a
list of 914 parts and prices, I'd love to see it posted here or even
mailed to me directly.

Burn Baby Burn!
