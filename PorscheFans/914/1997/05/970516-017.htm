Hi all,

	Well, I talked with the fellow that developed this electric horizontal
fan conversion. It comes complete with a fiberglass shroud to replace
the metal engine shroud, and claims to be 1200 cu ft/min with a 9.8A fan
motor. That's alot of air. 9.8A is not too much and the reduced load on
the crank would be quite beneficial. There are a couple drawbacks
though. 1st, stock FI has to go, it won't work with anything resembling
stock FI. Either a custom independent throttle body setup or dual carbs.
2nd, it does not take into account retaining the use of an alternator.
That would be something that would have to be dealt with somehow.
	With 1200 cu ft/min, I'd be concerned with shock-cooling at lower revs.
It's not quite as much as the stock fan at high rpms (1750 at 4600rpm),
but significantly more than the fan delivers at lower revs. So I had an
idea, use a head temp sensor to regulate the fan, the hotter the head,
the faster the fan. It's a DC motor, it'd be really easy to set up a
small feedback circuit to control fan speed.
	So, all that for $500, not a bad deal. It's from Air Cooled Classics in
Knoxville, TN. Their ad is in the May issue of Pano, page 59. I'm not
plugging them, but I figured someone else might want to dig into it on
their own. See if we as a group can determine if this is a good thing or
not.

So there's some more cud to chew on. I doubt I'll go with this
conversion for a while. For no other reason than I don't have the money
and time to convert to an Electromotive or other custom DFI, and I have
no desire to go to carbs right now.
