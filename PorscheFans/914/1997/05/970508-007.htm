Geologist Predicts Oil Production Decline

   LONDON (Reuter) - World oil production will start to decline within 15
   years if the rate of extraction remains at current levels, a U.S.
   geologist predicts.
   
   The global economic catastrophe that would follow a decline in
   production can only be prevented by the development of an alternative
   fuel source, said Craig Bond Hatfield, a geologist at the University
   of Toledo in Ohio.
   
   "The world will probably reach its maximum oil production rate in the
   next 15 years," he wrote in a commentary in the science journal
   Nature, recognized as an important world forum for such topics.
   
   Even if demand does not grow, the decline in production would start by
   the year 2036, he said Wednesday.
   
   "In 1985, global oil consumption was 59.7 million barrels per day,"
   Hatfield wrote. "By 1995 it was more than 69 million barrels per day."
   
   
   This 16 percent increase was accounted for by members of the
   Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
   
   "Geological data indicate that, during the next 10 years, oil
   production outside OPEC countries will remain incapable of
   significant, sustained growth and is likely to begin a permanent
   decline during the first decade of the 21st century," he wrote.
   
   New discoveries were not keeping pace with production, he added.
   "Globally, new discovery has averaged less than nine billion barrels
   per year since 1985 while consumption has averaged more than 23
   billion barrels per year."
   
   Hatfield examined known and estimated reserves and possibilities for
   new production and came to the conclusion that the oil was indeed
   drying up.
   
   It could take 140 years for every drop to go -- as long as it took to
   get to this point, he said.
   
   "But that's not a particularly important date because the exhaustion
   of the resource is only the end of a long, gradual decline in oil
   production which will last many decades," he said in a telephone
   interview.
   
   "The really important event is the time when world oil production
   reaches its peak and begins to fall." This, he predicted, would come
   in 2011.
   
   World demand for fuel will almost certainly be increasing as
   production declines, he said.
   
   "The unprecedented economic growth of the world been based in part on
   the increased production of petroleum."
   
   Once that stops, things could get bad.
   
   "To get a feeling of the econonomic impact of the decline, all you
   have to do is remember the very minor and very temporary shortages we
   experienced in the 1970s.
   
   "With a very minor shortfall in supply we experienced a several-fold
   increase in the price of oil that caused an increase in the price of
   everything else."
   
   Inflation and a decline in the world economy followed.
   
   "If you can envision that continuing on a permanent basis, with oil
   production declining every year, then you can appreciate the magnitude
   of the problem."
   
   Increased fuel efficiency would provide a short-term answer but the
   real solution would be the development of a long-term substitute for
   oil.
   
   "That is a Herculean task," Hatfield said, and noted work on synthetic
   fuels stopped to a great degree when oil prices stabilised in the
   1980s.
   
   "We desperately need to develop a more profound and sustained interest
   in a solution to problem because we don't have one," he said.

So, what can we do? Have we ben living on borrowed time since the oil 
shortages of the '70's??
