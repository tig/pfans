I have purchased a `72 parts car and have found some items on the car =
that are servicable, beyond the parts that I had originally purchased =
the car for. When I was pulling the driveline out I noticed that the =
rear spring/shock assembly was not stock. On further =
investigation/removal it was apparent that the springs were of a larger =
dia.(.446) as opposed to what I measured on the stock spring(.385). =
These springs are also substantially shorter than the stock =
springs(about 5.5" free length). Does anyone have any idea what spring =
rate this dia. wire equals? Also the shocks are a red colour with the =
name "HECO" stamped into them, anyone have any info on this =
manufacturer? With these discoverys` I am obligated to remove the front =
struts to see what shock inserts are installed. Another question, is =
there any way to determine the dia. of the torsion bars without removing =
them? Last question, is the gearset in a tail shifter the same as a side =
shifter and if so can 1st gear be replaced by only removing the cover at =
the rear of the trans(aft of the centre bearing support)?
For any Canadians on this list, I have a `72 shell for sale @ $250.00 =
CDN. I am in the Hamilton/Toronto area.
Thanks       Mark A Selkirk.
