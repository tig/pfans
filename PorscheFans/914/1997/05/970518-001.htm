I havn't found my BFG tire chart yet, but the 884 rev/mile for the
205/50-15 seems to be very close to BFGs number if I remember correctly.
So I'd say that hub center to tread is a pretty good measurement. Why do
you say that a hub center to tread measurement is innacurate. BTW, both
measurements I made were on wheels that were not loaded, i.e. off the
car. So a radius measurement should give an accurate circumference just
fine. And while the radius at any given point may change on a road wheel
due to load and sidewall flex, the circumference will not change.
