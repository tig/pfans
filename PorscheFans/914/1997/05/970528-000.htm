Good point. I saw the pictures on the web page. It also seems to lack a
hole for the oil pressure sender, and the head temp sensor.

Another good point. But that may simply not be apparent on the picture.
I give 'em the benefit of the doubt on this one though. That's a pretty
fundamental thing to omit.

No, but it's readilly apparent in the picture. It's easy to mount a
block off to the stock oil cooler and plum oil cooler lines off the
engine, or that same location for that matter.

A VERY good idea.

That looks to be a little more difficult. For one, the alternator
recieves cooling air from the fan housing. In addition a pully for the
alternator would need to be created, and it can't be too small or it'll
burn up the alternator.

Rain? I doubt would be much of a problem. You drive through deep puddles
don't you? And the bottom of the engine, cylinders and heads are
splashed every now and then. Rust however, from sitting in the rain may
become more of an issue.

As for over cooling? I think that could be a problem. But not at high
RPM, if anything it's insufficient at high rpm. The maker claims 1,200
cuft/min output from the fan. That's alot of air, but the original
factory system delivers just over 1,700 cuft/min at 4600 rpm. Now that's
just at 4600 rpm, and they claim that this is for a racing engine, which
runs at higher rpms than a street car, and as such will run hotter, and
need more air. I would not recomend this system for a street driven
competition car. The air supply at higher rpm would not be enough. It'd
probably be good for engines that run in sprints. And don't spend too
long at really high teperatures. But for say a track car that runs a 20
minute race? I don't think it'd work. At the low rpm range, the fan
would be delivering too much air, it's not regulated by engine speed
like the crank driven fan is. But that could be compensated by adding a
small feedback circuit that takes its input off of the head temp. The
cooler the heads, the less voltage it delivers to the fan. It's a DC
fan, so that's easy to control. Which could also aid in rapid warmup if
one so desired.

That's something that should probably be left to the buyer too. Any car
that has a non-stock setup (like this requires) will probably be set up
a little differently from each other. But a hard point or two on the
shroud for mounting accessories would be nice.

I'd say if your ditching the original fan altogether, that'd be a
perfect place for a crank fire system. But a shroud over the wheel would
certainly make sense.

You said it!

I'd say that the fan certainly produces a substantial amount of drag on
the engine. It takes energy to move that much air, and that energy is
coming directly from the engine. But I know that the alternator has some
impact on power. Not enough to be blatantly noticable though. I've
thrown my belt numerous times and never noticed a sudden increase in
power.

I'm going to wait on this critter. I don't know how usefull it would be
in my application anyhow. I don't even know if it'd be legal in my
class. The rules allow changing or replacing any fan with an
electrically driven one, but it also prohibits the cutting or removing
of sheetmetal in the car. It's worth getting a clarification on.
