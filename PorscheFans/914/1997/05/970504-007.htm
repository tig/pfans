914ers,

Anyone interested in replacing their aging four cylinder with a rotary,
take note.  My Brother recently bought a pair of Generation 1 RX7's.  The
'85 (which he is keeping) is in great shape, but he wishes to sell the '83
he got in the deal.  The car has some rust in the doors, and a little in
the fenders, but is structurally sound elseware.  The best thing about the
car is the engine and tranny. It's showing 130,000+ on the O.D., but you'd
think this thing was a new engine by the way it starts and runs.  It is
very strong all the way to redline.

I've seen talk about rotary conversions in our beloved German autos, so I
thought I'd post this message to see if anyone is interested.  Personally,
I'd keep the car for autocrossing if I didn't already have my 914 and ACR
keeping me busy.

I told him to get it out of my driveway as fast as he could, so he wants a
whole $200 for the car.  It's in Akron, OH if anyone is interested.  Please
respond to me directly.

Thanks for the bandwidth,

Dion
