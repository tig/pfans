O.K.,if you're gonna beg.  It fit like a glove was my first impression.
And of course, I stalled it letting out the clutch.  The first run through
the cones was quick, but slow compared to what the car could do.  Remember,
the owner was watching from the sidelines, and the car only had 1500 miles
on it.  Needless to say, I was a bit nervous.  My first reaction was that
the car was solid and not a lot of roll, but I wanted to get one clean run
under my belt.  Coming through the last gate, I floored it (I couldn't
resist), twitched the rear, and took off like a rocket (remember, I'm used
to driving a 914/Neon combination).  But I would have to say, the most
impressive thing about the car was its brakes.  I'm lucky I had my seatbelt
on when I hit the brakes after the finish line.  WOW!

The second run was much faster.  It was on street rubber, so I didn't want
to push it too much, but I let it hang out a little more.  The car tracked
incredibly smooth through the slalom, didn't have any under/oversteer in
the sweeper and accelerated like it had power to spare through the last
couple of gates.  It definately had more then I was willing to give it.
And then there was those brakes again!

After the second run, I gave the keys back.  Thoughts of selling the house,
914, the dog, the wife, all went through my mind.  I had to give it back.
Little did I know, my wife had taken it around the course earlier and had
the same thoughts I did.  O.K., so I'm taking bids: 5'2", 115 lbs., brown
hair, loves Porsches...
