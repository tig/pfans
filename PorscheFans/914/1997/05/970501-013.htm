My understanding is that carbs alone do *not* increase power for CIS
cars, and in most cases will hurt driveablility.  The reason being that
the cams are soft and that the amount of overlap between intake and
exhaust timing precludes any serious power production.  To switch to carbs,
the cams would really need to be swapped.

Just what I heard....
