Well, the Haynes manual indicates that screwing the idle adjustment
screw in (as opposed to backing it off) increases idle speed.
Regardless, you're right - it doesn't appear to affect the idle speed at
all.  The only problem with your theory below in my case is something I
forgot to include.  I have no cold start injector.  Well, it's there,
but it's not hooked up.  Yes, I know, it should be, but it doesn't
change my current situation.  The other thing I can't figure out, is
that if I truly am way, way lean, than shouldn't I be seeing traces of
white smoke at the exhaust, if not huge plumes of it?  Like I said,
there's no smoke...

Thanks,
