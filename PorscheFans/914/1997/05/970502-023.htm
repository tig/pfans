The carbs are fine....my distributor is the problem.  The carbs work
on my friend's car (who has a modified distributor).  My distributor
is a 1980 version which requires BOTH vacuum and mechanical
advance.  With no vacuum source, it's limited to about 17 degrees
of advance.  That's the main problem.  (yes, that part isn't the carbs
fault)

I've got a Tercel for puttering...  :-)

FI handles the warm-up issue FAR superior to carbs, and my
experience has shown to me that FI provides for a more "balanced"
driving experience over carbs.  Also, emissions testing is forcing
FI on me...  :-(
