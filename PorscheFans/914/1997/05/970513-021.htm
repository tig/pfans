FourteenFans,

My Pop bought a tow bar setup from someone from CA on the old Philes
list.  I bought the car from him, but he kept the bar.  I'd like to
purchase the same kit if possible, since the holes for the brackets are
already set up.

The rest of the post is general (dis)interest on the really new and the
really old.  If you're arguing tire compounds and tread patterns and
such, you might refer to the last part, taken from a 550 RS _Driver's_
Manual.

'73 914 2.0 w/ stock tread R1s

=======================

Took a drive in the Carrera S today.  Don't get me wrong, I can't wait
to get in my 914 this p.m., but it's nice to be able to "compare".  I
think if I'm ever in the market (in say, 15 years) for the last of the
air-cooled P-cars, I'll take this piece over the Turbo S, "base" Turbo,
or C4S.  Something about RWD and big gumballs minus all that carbon
fibre trim or look fast crud.

Also got my hands on a 1954 Type 550/1500 RS driver's manual (yes, they
title it DRIVER'S, not owner's) today.  A few excerpts:

Forward:  You are now the owner of a Spyder/Type 550/1500 RS

The fastest automobile which the firm of Porsche has ever built.  Your
success will, in the long run, depend on how you handle and care for the
car.

For that reason this booklet was prepared to give you important hints
and information.

We wish you in all driving   GREAT SUCCESS

Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche KG - Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen

**Pasted on the inside of the cover is a big red tag that reads:

NOTE!
Skid tendencies on racing tires can be improved by dividing the area of
each tread projection by vertically slicing down through it.
