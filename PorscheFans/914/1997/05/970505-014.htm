<<       My screw got striped and I drilled it out and the cap still does not
 want to come off, I have ever tried heating the cap so it will expand but
 still will not come off.  I have been beating it out but after about 1/4 and
 inch it is stuck and that is where I and at now. 
 thanks

Sorry Eric, I didn't realize you were that far along.  Here's 2
recommendations:

1) Make sure that the set screw is completely drilled out.  The pointy end
goes pretty far into the shifter shaft.

2) If all else fails (and I've had this happen myself) you will have to get
an
angle grinder with a cut-off wheel and slice the ball socket, heat it, spread
it
with a chisel, then it will come off.  Obviously you will then need to
replace 
it with a good one.  They don't cost that much used $5 or $10. I think.

Sometimes they are rusted onto the shaft, now I always coat the shaft with
never-seez when I put them back together so this doesnt happen again.
