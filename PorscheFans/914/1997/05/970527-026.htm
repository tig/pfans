Comments?

I received a color flyer in USnailmail today; these are my 
observations/questions:
1. It apparently comes without spark plug holes cut (so it will fit 2.0 or 
other heads); something for the buyer to do, I guess, but locations should be 
noted in the instructions (are they?).  Similarly, I would expect the 
fiberglass to be thicker than sheet metal, so stock spark plug air seals 
probably won't fit (at least without cutting each seal's groove wider).
2. No mention of attachment method; it does not appear to use the standard 
sheet metal screw locations.
3. I think I heard on the list the stock oil cooler must be removed, but 
there's no mention of that requirement in the flyer.
4. It has no intake screen; I think it should to keep stuff too big from going 
through the fins from getting into the fan area (e.g., leaves when parked in 
the pits with the lid up, a dropped wrench while adjusting timing, not to 
mention one's fingers).  A 1/8" grid screen would be easy to fabricate, 
however.
5. Still no mention of an alternator bracket.  At the least, buyers would want 
to know where to get one (recommended supplier) or would want a blueprint they 
could take to their local machine shop for fabrication - not an unreasonable 
expectation to me of a $500 item manufacturer.
6. No mention of possible downsides or applications to be avoided.  For 
example, it's obvious it can't be used with stock FI, but does its racing 
function imply it shouldn't be used on the street for some reason?  Is there 
such a thing as too much cooling air going over the engine?  What about using 
it in the rain - any problem there?
7. My current accelerator cable bracket would mount inside the fan housing, so 
obviously a higher bracket would be required.  Again, as in #5 above, where do 
they recommend you get one that will work with their product, or how should 
one be made?
8. They show a degree wheel where the impeller was; again, there's an 
opportunity for them to offer an optional extra ($) or make a recommendation.  
(My first impression was that the wheel made sense; my second impression was 
that if your hand ever came too close, you'd look like a retired Slice-O-Matic 
salesman in about one bloody second!)
9. On the secondary gains side, it would sure be a lot easier to change (late 
model) inner engine mounts with that impeller casing out of the way.
10. They claim "%HP" gains, but aren't clear how much is due to the fan 
change, and how much is due to the removal of the alternator.

All in all, it's intriguing and it looks like there could be enough profit 
margin to allow the product to be produced over an extended period of time.  
I'd value answers/feedback on my observations/questions.
