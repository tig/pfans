My understanding of polar moment of interia is different and I
am confused by the description given above.  My definition is 
the resistance of the car to forces (sliding, spinnng) 
perpendicular to the direction the car is travelling.

It also has nothing to do with weight distribution and alot to
do with where the weight is located.  A 914 with a near 50/50
distribution and a 928 with a near 50/50 distribution behave 
completely differently.

Since the 914s weight is concentrated at the center of the car
it is much easier for the car to enter into and more difficult
to recover from a spin - it's basically like a top.  Whereas in
the 928 with the engine up front and the transaxle in the rear, 
the weight is distributed more evenly and centered over the wheels.
That makes the 928 extremely forgiving and resistant to spinning.

Regardless of how you corner-balance your 914 you can't change
its polar moment of inertia significantly...

Spewing forth more wierd stuff I'm just beginning to understand,
