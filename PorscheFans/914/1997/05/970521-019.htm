Ah! The rotory topic surfaces once again!

I don't know what it's at at the crank, but 170+ at the rear wheels is
what it was dynoed at last year. And I think he managed to find a little
more power this year through the FI system, it's an Electromotive TEC2
programable system.

Do keep in mind though, that this car, with race clutch and that motor
is not easy off the line. If you don't launch it hard, it'll want to
stall. So as a street driven car, it's less than ideal. Hell, this
particular car isn't even registered anymore, it lives on trailers and
race tracks now.

His car, which won the last Pro Solo2 in CSP was described as the
fastest duraflame log on wheels. I havn't seen the new paint job, but
I've heard it's pretty wild.
