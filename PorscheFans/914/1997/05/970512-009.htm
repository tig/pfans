	Hey, I resemble that remark!  ;^)

	I got a lot of advice about break-in on my motor back when.  The
2K-3K RPM for 20-30 minutes is supposedly mostly to break-in the cam, cam
bearings, and lifters.  It may or may not also be good for the rings.
You'll have to choose if you want to do this or not.
	Anyway, Jerry covered a lot of it, but I'll forward what Stan Hanks
told him (which he forwarded to me back when I was facing the break-in):

	Tim Radsick had a slightly different procedure:
