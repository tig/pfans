Jim:

I have no idea how large your condenser will be, so I don't know 
which aftermarket front bumpers/valences/airdams will fit.

However, there IS one thing to keep in mind no matter which bumper 
you use:  If your condenser is mounted between the airdam and 
the front of the trunk, it'll be protected only by a thin piece of 
fiberglass... Which means that even a light tap against a curb may 
destroy it.

You can build a nerf-bar enclosure around the condenser to protect 
it, but that enclosure will take a fair amount of room.  The best way 
might be to mount the condenser in the front trunk, then cut holes in 
the front of the trunk through which you can duct air to it.  Don't 
forget to provide an exit for the hot air after it passes through 
the condenser.
