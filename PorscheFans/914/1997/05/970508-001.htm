    No, it hasn't, since the size of the contact patch is only
    dependent (in the idealized case, ignoring tire-construction
    differences, etc.) on the normal force and the tire pressure.

    Assuming, just for the sake of argument, that your assertion IS
    true, though....

    Bzzt... Wrong.

    As you said, the relationship you describe between coefficient of
    friction, normal force, and tractive capacity is from "pure
    physics" (i.e., Newton's laws of friction).

    If you read your Physics books closely, you'll see that that
    relationship only holds true for friction between SMOOTH bodies.
    Tires and asphalt don't obey those laws... If they did, no tire
    would ever be capable of generating acceleration higher than 1G.

    At the tire/road interface, there are a couple of things
    happening:  First, the rough elastic tire surface grips the rough
    surface of the road mechanically, like two gears meshing
    together.  Second, there's a smaller, but significant adhesion
    between the two surfaces at the MOLECULAR level.  This is VERY
    different from the "classic" physics models.

    Untrue.  Although it's a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation, you
    can look at it this way:  Dragster tires are run at very low
    pressures to increase the size of the contact patch; with those
    low pressures, the tires HAVE to be wide in order to support the
    weight of the car.

    The drag-tire wind-up that you've seen is NOT designed to
    increase the circumference "to aid acceleration"; in fact,
    increased rolling circumference HURTS acceleration.

    This can be compensated for by gearing the transmission lower,
    and drag racers are willing to do that because there's a HUGE
    benefit to be gained from this odd tire behavior:  When the car's
    launched, the tires don't start moving as soon as the wheel does;
    instead, the tire sidewalls wind up like spiral springs, storing
    up a LOT of energy that's suddenly released a moment later.  This
    release of energy HURLS the dragster forward off the line.

    Anyway...

    No one completely understands how tires work, but there's an 
    excellent -- if slightly math-heavy and expensive -- book that 
    contains just about all the information that IS known... It's
    called "Race Car Vehicle Dynamics", by Milliken and Milliken
    (ISBN 1-56091-526-9).

    If your bookstore doesn't have it, you can order it direct from
    the SAE (412 776-4841).  It costs $75 for SAE members, $85 for
    non-members.
