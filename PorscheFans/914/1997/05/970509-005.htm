With heavy heart I report to you that Anita Moyle has died.  Husband Pat
returned from testing at Second Creek race track yesterday and found
her dead, apparently from one of the natural causes which do things like
that to us suddenly.  Anita is known to the PCA Club Racing world as the
head of Club Racing licensing.  Husband Pat is a Club Race steward,
wizard Porsche shop owner, and the "Pat9146@aol.com" who
generously shares his experience with the rest of us on these lists.

I had thought Anita's distinctive laugh and passionate entheusiasm made
her immortal.  Pat is a strong man, but this is a huge loss.  He lists his
address as his business:  MotorSport, Inc., 1921 A. West Yale,
Englewood, CO 80110.  303-922-3560.
