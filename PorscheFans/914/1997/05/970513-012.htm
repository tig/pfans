Thank you for all the replies to my post on 911 engine selection for the
engine swap. I just thought I would tell you where I am in the conversion
process. The parts have all arrived for the suspension upgrade, well at
least enough to start. 85 911 front struts and brakes are going up front.
In the rear calipers are being rebuilt and split so I vented rotor can go
back there. The rear springs are going to 150lb with koni's and adjustable
purches. The collars on the spindles on the fron struts are being machined
to lower the car an inch or so. The only question is do I need to put a
bigger sway bar up front to balance out the 150lb springs in the back?
Also, will 150lb springs be stiff enough when I put the six in?

Anyway I want this car done right and I think I am doing things in the
right order. Body first all rust has been removed and some stuctural
support added (rocker pannel clam shels, but I am contemplating the 916
chasis stiffening kit. And then suspension and brakes as described above.

ps the car will not be flared at first. I just bought wheels and tires to
go under stock fenders. But this project is a long term, so I could flare
the body when the tires wear out and the bank account recovers from this
round of upgrades.
