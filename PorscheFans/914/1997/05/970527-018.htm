Dear Mr. Knott,

You noticed that, did you?  :-)

You're right.  I failed to mention the easiest solution of all:  Make the
ittie-bittie spark-plug access holes on the Type IV tin-ware larger in
diameter by about a tenth of an inch and you're living on Easy St. when it
comes to using Corvair-type air-seals (the only ones that really work).

The trouble is, you can't do it with the tin-ware installed without getting
metal particles all over the engine and maybe not even then, because you
got
to do a nice job of it and the holes are hell to see, at least on the '72 I
have as a working model.  (You must work on your knees, leaning into the
engine compartment, arms extended.  Given the size of my belly and
shoulders
and turban I'm lucky to fit in the cargo bay.)   And you can't pull the
upper-cylinder tin-wear without lowering the engine.  Soz I didn't bother
to
give David & the List the benefit of my laziness for fear of evoking rage,
envy and discontent.  But on the hole, making it bigger is easier than
making
the plug smaller.

But with the tin-ware off?  Ah-ha!  (He said.)  Ah-ha indeed!  A carefully
drawn line with a Magic-Marker, about two minutes work with a die-grinder
and
the deed is done.  (Mebbe twenty minutes using a stone in a drill-motor.)
A
nibbler works too but nobody knows what I mean when I say 'nibbler.'  And
you
have to dress the edge.  Either that or bleed a lot.  Type IV tin-ware is
fabricated from oh-thirty-two stock, heavier than that used for the
shrouding
of up-right engines but still very easy to work.

 Be careful on #2 & #4.  Open up the hole only on the forward (FIF) side,
otherwise you make the complex-compound situation worse, requiring the plug
to curve in two planes.  This leaves the central opening slightly
off-center
with regard to the spark-plug but the length of the connector/insulator
accomodates the small angle that results.
