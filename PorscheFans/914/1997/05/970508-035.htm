I received my June issue of Excellence in the mail yesterday. After
immediately turning to the tech pages so see if they had anything on 914's. I
started with an article about the boxer by Peter Brock. It was a fairly good
article and opened with "When Dr. Porsche designed the first 356 prototype,"
say Haywood, he chose a mid engined layout . It was the same with the 550
Spyders and RS60's of the mid 60's.

No where in the article was  there a mention of the 914! Perhaps there never
was a 914. I immediately drove home, looked in the garage and he was right.
My 914 was missing with a note in it's place stating that there never was a
914. The note was signed by PCNA
