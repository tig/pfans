Porsche switched to the 915 tranny when the 2.4 engine came out
for the 911.

I've forgotten the source, but I heard that tranny failures in 911 race
cars were mostly ring & pinion problems (race cars don't suffer from
damage due to dumping the clutch in 1st gear because they don't
do that in a race....)

Using a clock as an example of the arc the ring gear moves in, the
ring & pinion problem stems from the fact that the ring gear picks
up the oil at 6:00 and spins clockwise to the pinion gear at 3:00.
During that long time (9 hours!!!) lots of the oil gets flung off to the
walls and very little is left to lubricate the meshing gears.
(This problem can be minimized by installing a tranny oil cooler
with a pump to spray streams of oil at all of the meshing gears
in the gearbox.)

In a mid-engined application, the ring gear is flipped around to the
other side of the pinion gear resulting in the rotation being reversed.
This makes the ring gear pick up the oil at 6:00 and spins
counter clockwise to 3:00 (just 3 hours!!!) to the meshing pinion.
Since lots of oil is still on the ring gear, failures of this nature
are far less frequent.

This is why you see many 914-6 cars out there with the 901
tranny still running fine....just don't drop the clutch at the traffic
light all the time and you'll be fine.
