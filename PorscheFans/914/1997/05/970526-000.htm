 Now some people may disagree with me here, but I found that using just a
 light film of silly-cone to hold the cork gasket to the valve cover
 allows it to stay in place while being installed. And will also help it
 resist shifting as the vacuum under the cover gets higher as the rpms go
 up. The cover of course has to be clean first.

I found the same thing in my Club Racer.  Use the silicone to hold the gasket
to the cover.  If you don't, it will bow on either side of the middle holders
and leak.  You don't need to use anything between the gasket and the head.
 But above all, make sure the sealing surface is straight and true, or it
will never seal.   And are you sure it is the valve cover and not a pinched
pushrod tube seal?
