They're in the Automotion catalog.  Or, you can go to a metric supply house if 
there's one nearby.  The one I went to knew what I was asking for and referred 
to them as Japanese nuts (one mm smaller wrench on standard size thread).

914ers,

For the first time in 6 months, my 914 finally saw it's engine again!  

O.K., everything is hooked up, all the cables are attached, and I have good
oil and fuel pressure.  The last thing to put on before I attempt to start
it is the exhaust.  Early style 2.0L exhaust with new nuts and washers.  

I can get three nuts on, but not the last one; just not enough room to fit
the 13mm socket up in there.  I've read about this problem before, but
never payed too much attention since it was easy with my 1.7L exhaust
system.  Anyone know where I can get the OEM nuts which take the 12mm
socket?  Also, I am in need of a 2.0L muffler hanger in good condition.

As always, thanks a bunch!

Dion
