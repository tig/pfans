My books read that the front should be 1/2 inch lower than the rear.
Between this and an eyeball have served me well.

I guess the *right* way to set the ride height is to set the back via
whichever of the 3 "spring perches" you decide to use, and corner balance
each front since on a "stock" setup the front is the place adjustable.
