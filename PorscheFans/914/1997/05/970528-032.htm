Greetings, 914-er's!

  I have a question for the list in general, and possibly Andrew Warren and Mike Lee specifically.  
Some time in the hopefully-not-too-distant future, I wish to re-enable my air-conditioning.  I don't care 
for the complete loss of front trunk room, and the poor airflow characteristics of the stock setups, and 
was thinking about a replacement front bumper assembly with enough room to mount a 
custom-made condenser.

  It sounds as though both of you gentlemen might have recommendations as to what I could to my 
front bumper area.  I would like to remain as close to stock as possible, as I rather like the looks of 
the original 914, but I also need to mount that condenser.  I would prefer not to have the car start 
looking like an A.C. Cobra, with a hugh protruding snout with a grill, but I really don't know what's 
available, and what's more important, what's practical.

  Any suggestions?

                                                  Thanks in Advance,
                                                  Jim T.
