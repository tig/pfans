My opinion is forget the 100# "stock" springs and go for a set of Weltmeister
PROGRESSIVE RATE 140# springs.  The PROGRESSIVE RATE will give you as nice a
street feel as lesser 100# springs, but will give a little more performance
for those spirited drives.

As Josh said, don't go to the expense of the adjustable plates unless you
plan on corner-balancing for serious racing.  By the way, the Koni spring
perches require a different spring with smaller diameter coils.

Sean at AA suggested to me that the Bilsteins are a much better "all around"
shock than the Koni's.  His reccommendation, if I recall, was based on the
fact that Bilsteins have much less fade and longer overall life expectancy.
