O.K., I'm just about stumped.  As I posted last week, I got my '76 914
2.0 running again, but am having difficulty with the idle.  Well, it's a
little more than just an idle problem.  Jim thought that perhaps it was
just not capable of overcoming the internal friction at low RPMs, and
recommended driving it a bit to see what happens.  Well, I tried, but
it's not quite driveable yet.  Whereas the car can maintain a steady RPM
under no load, you have to "blip" the throttle repeatedly to increase
the RPM.  Simply stepping on the gas pedal causes the motor to stumble,
and eventually die.  When the motor is cold, it'll start right up and
sit at about 2000 rpms without dropping.  At this point,  checked each
cylinder by pulling the FI wires.  Each appears to be contributing
equally.  I checked my head temp sensor, my aux. air temp sensor, and my
manifold pressure sensor.  All appear to be O.K.  All of my connections
appear to be good, and I couldn't find any split hoses.  After the car
warms up a little, it'll steadily drop until it dies.  It'll start up
fine every time, but it just stumbles when I hit the gas.  I have a
permanently mounted fuel pressure gauge, and it's reading 28 psi.  I
checked the TPS, and heard at least 19 clicks, but there may have been
20.  I've got plenty of fresh gas in the tank, my oil level is good, and
my pressure light goes off every time.  I didn't want to have to mess
with the timing, so during the top-end rebuild, my distributor was never
removed or adjusted at all.  Regardless, I tried to check the timing,
but if I remove the tiny line that runs from the vacuum advance
mechanism to the throttle body, I can get the car to start, but I can't
"blip" it up to 3500.  If I check it at 3500 with the vacuum line
connected, the mark on the fan misses the notch by about 1/3 in.  I had
to guess with my mixture setting, so the knob is sitting halfway between
full rich and full lean.  I think that about covers all of my testing.

So, any ideas?  I have a feeling I'm going to have to get the car towed
to my mechanic so he can tinker with the mixture, but I'd really love to
get it running well enough to avoid the tow.  Any thoughts or comments
would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks again,
