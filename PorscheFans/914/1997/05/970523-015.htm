  J.J.,  I have a VDO aftermarket oil pressurre gauge also (just installed); I got the "kit' from GPR in 
San Luis Obispo.  Included in the kit was a rubber hose, and an adapter to go on the end of the hose. 
 I don't know if all the hoses are the same, but mine was an adapting hose; that is, it had 1/8" NPT on 
one (the engine) end, but the other end was designed to accept a flare nut type tube fitting.  GPR 
included another adapter to convert back to 1/8" NPT to screw on to the sending unit.  If your hose is 
the same as mine, there is no way that it will seal properly at the sending unit end without this adapter.
  To determine if yours requires an adapter, examine the end that connects to the sending unit.  If it 
has a thin nut that is part of the hose crimp fitting, and will not turn independently of the hose itself, and 
if this thin nut is next to a much thicker hex nut portion that turns freely on the end of the hose without 
winding it up, you require an adapter.  The clincher is to look inside the  hose end that connects to 
the sending unit; if you see a sort of "ball" with a hole in the middle, this is what is supposed to 
engage the tubing flare.
  If this is what you have, then you will need the flare-nut to 1/8" NPT adapter.  I know that these are 
available from GPR, but I think that they are also available from most FLAPS with a good stock of 
fuel line parts.  Screw the adapter onto the sending unit, using teflon tape to seal the joint, and then 
screw the hose onto the adapter.  Use two wrenches, one to hold the thin nut (hose) from turning, and 
another to tighten the flare-nut connection.  This should stop your leaks.
   In regard to an electrical ground, my VDO sensor came with a steel clamp that wraps around the 
sensor and mounts it with a single bolt.  I used a crimp-type eyelet terminal on a short piece of wire 
under the mounting bolt next to the clamp  and grounded the sending unit that way.

  As far as disconnecting the hose from the engine, that might be difficult.  It depends on how tightly it 
was screwed in.  Dave Darling once mentioned that he used needle-nose pliers to install his.  If you 
have a husky pair, you might try this.  Failing that, the only sure way I can think of is to cut the hose off 
as close to the sheet metal as you can, and then put a deepwell socket over the hose stub and 
unscrew it that way.  Of course, you will then have to obtain a replacement hose.

  I recently posted a technique for connecting the VDO sending unit that avoids most of these 
problems.  If you like, I will dig it out of the archives and send it to you.

  I ran into exactly the same thing with my car.  I think that it is simply that the new rings are so tight and 
have so much friction that the engine just doesn't develop enough power at normal idle settings to 
overcome the resistance.  As it wears in a bit, this should improve.  I'll keep you posted; please do 
the same for me if you find out differently, so I can fix mine!

  I think the Haynes book has it wrong... there is a spring on the clutch pedal assembly that keeps the 
clutch pedal slightly depressed at all times, so the "pedal travel" method does not work, unless you 
apply it in reverse!
  Bernie C. tells me that the spring on the pedal assembly is very necessary to avoid wearing out the 
clutch cable on the reverse roller housing, so that means that the best method for adjustment is as 
follows:
  From under the car:  Grab the clutch cable end and pull it forward; there should be about 3/16" of 
room to move it forward before the pedal hits the upper stop.  This will require considerable effort 
because you are compressing the spring on the pedal assembly.  Adjust the lock nut to provide this 
amount of "free play".  Alternatively, from the pedal cluster:  Grab the clutch pedal and pull it BACK 
(opposite to the direction that you push it to disengage the clutch.  It should move about 3/4" to 1" 


rearward before hitting the stop.  If more or less, adjust from underneath the car as above.

  Congratulations on getting your pet running, and best wishes.

                                                            Jim T.
