I've got a pair of new Weber 40 IDA 3C carbs for my engine and they
still suck.  They are set up with the correct jets and such, but you
need to modify your distributor in order to get carbs to work on the
3.0 engine.

CIS should have better throttle response than the carbs....plus CIS
is better when your car is cold since the Weber's don't have any
chokes.  I guess I could install a makeshift hand throttle like the
early 911....but I now have to worry about emissions so it doesn't
matter anymore.

Carbs would give me more top end power since you can set them up
to flow more air than the CIS....but that isn't enough for me.  I want
the rest of the stuff CIS can do that carbs can't.
