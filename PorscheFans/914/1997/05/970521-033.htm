Hey Mike, this deal would happen to be in Maryland would it?  I was
talking to a guy (small used car lot) who has one for sale that sounds
just like you where saying?  He had an ad in the paper bout 3-4 months
ago for $3999 and since it didn't sell at that price he bumped it up to
$4999.  Guess he figured when they came in he just cut a grand off the
top to "Make the sale" or something like that!  If it's the same one i
guess i won't have to go and check it out now, so let me know!
Later,

PS  Still trying to find a decent 914!!!
