Does anybody know if a driver's side window net can be attached to the door 
rather than to the top (in a car without a rollbar)?

I'm designing a frame for a net that would have vertical members which would 
slide down into the glass channels and two horizontal member that would go 
through the "pockets" in the net's top and bottom edges.  See anything illegal 
in that?  I don't see any good way to fasten the top of the net to the 
fiberglass roof - bolts through the f-glass would be ugly and not have much 
holding power due to the weakness of the f-glass.

Also, I've been told to put braces on the back window for track days.  Should 
they be on the inside or the outside of the window (inside's easier because of 
clearance with the engine lid)?
