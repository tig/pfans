Ben, Jeff and any other CSPers out there,

	As you probably know, I've been debating the 13" wheel situation for a
while now. And had come to lamentable conclusion a while back that it
wouldn't work. I was wrong! I borrowed a fellow CSPers wheel today to
see if it would fit over my brakes. And sure enough, it did! BARELY.
Maybe 0.1 inch to spare, but it cleared. The problem area is at the
bottom of the ball joint at the end of the A-arm. However, I think this
can be considered part of the strut, and struts are open in SP. So, I'm
going to do a little poking around and see how much the bottom of that
joint can be trimmed. It doesn't interfere by much, but it's enough
right now.

	DuraLight 13X8 wheels weigh a scant 7lbs apiece. And now BFG and
Hoosier make a 225/50-13 and Hoosier even makes a 225/45-13. Now
_there's_ some low geared tires with some meat on 'em.

	Today's event was a fast course. Almost all a constant 3rd gear run.
Fun, but I never got really deep into 3rd, and the course was open
enough that 2nd was a waste of time. I doubt I'll go to the trials
tomorow, the forcast is for lots of rain. Autox in the rain, LOVE IT
(the great equalizer). But time trials in the rain, I don't think so.
