Hello Porsche Fans, 

 Since I like to brag about service's I have received in the Porsche
world , I would like to tell you about two guys that really go out of
there way to help.

 I had been looking for a Rear Roll Bar Pad for some time, had a few
lined up and they fell through, or it just didnt work out, mainly
because used wasnt good enough. Anyway, Lister        David Buhain
(PorscheParts@compuserve.com) was able to find me a brand new one, Its
perfect, Thanks Dave.

 Another PCA Club member Ron Snellgrove (non internet)             (909)
686-9386. painted me a Blue 914-6 GT rock! Its the coolest rock , I've
ever seen. I would HIGHLY recommend Ron's Rocks. He can paint any car
you would like, I have seen his other work and its great too. I plan on
scanning a picture of it in and email it to anyone who wants to see it,
but it will be a few weeks. I will bring it to Solvang for the reunion
too.

 Now for the question; Now that I have a new in the box dash and roll
bar pad, what do I do with them since they will need to live in the box
for a while (year or so) Should I treat them with  anything ? Or just
leave them baged up ?? They are stored indoors in a closet, I just
though since they are this old, something should be done?
 What do you think, 
 Don

 BTW...Buy a Porsche Rock, it looks great on my office desk!! 

LAst Item, For all of you who wanted a Combo Gauge (Last Pano) My
machinest guy, backed out, and I let anonther list member take over the
project, do to lack of time, Once he finds out if it going to happen on
his end, I will be advertized.

 Take CAre
.
