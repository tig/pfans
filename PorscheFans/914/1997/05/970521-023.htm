I saw this on the Type 2 VW list.  For those who don't know, Bob Hoover is
a frequent poster with lots of VW experience.  Lots of good engine info and
much of it will apply.  They have his messages archived as 'The Sermons of
Bob Hoover'.

Another VW poster with archived messages is Mike West - Pushing Back the
Darkness.

Bob's message below was just posted and since it mentions improved air
seals I have copied the entire email.  I'm going to try these seals when I
put my new plug wires on.

Subject: Plug Wires & Air-Seals

<<I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations about where to get
<<high quality plug wires.  What do I look for to determine high quality?


Dyer,

The standard insualtion factor for plug leads is 600 volts per mil of
insulation, a spec easily met by all spark-plug wiring sets when they are
new.  But only silicon-based insulating material stannds up to the high
temperatures and voltages over prolonged periods of time, which is why all
modern car-makers use silicon spark plug wires.

To Volkswagen owners the spark-plug air-seal is far more important than the
particular type of wire.

I use the El Cheepo silicon plug-wire sets available from J.C.Whitney.  The
ones especially made for Volkswagens come with the Corvair-style air-seal,
a
thousand times better than the things VW used.  The wires use graphite
conductors and may be shortened (at the distributor-end) by carefully
prying
off the connector, stripping back the insulation, folding the conductor
over
to contact the connector, and re-attaching the thing.  Examine the
factory-end before removing it to see what I mean.

Although these wires cost only about ten dollars per set they have provided
excellent long-term service.  Even with the higher spark voltage from the
CDI
modules and even when left out in the weather, as on my Baja, in more than
ten years of use the only problems I've experienced had to do with
aging/cracking of the air-seal, which is easily replaced.

The Corvair-type air-seals do best on single-port engines.  On dual-ports
the
angle of the spark-plug access holes in the cylinder-head tin-ware makes it
difficult to install the air-seal properly.  My solution was to cut off a
bit
of the insulating sleeve that fits over the spark plug.  The sleeve has a
molded shoulder that fits the air-seal.  By shortening the sleeve it allows
the molded shoulder to be pushed a bit farther onto the spark plug, after
which the air-seal can be pushed a bit deeper into the opening.

 In the vehicle it is difficult to properly install the air-seal on #3 & #1
 on DP engines due to the location of the manifold  but you'll find they go
in quickly enough if you use a little green soap or rubber lubricant.

If you will install platinum-tipped spark plugs (about two bucks each in my
area) you'll probably have no need to remove the things for several years,
making the difficulties of installing the superior air-seals a minor point.

Given the importance of insuring adequate air-flow in the vicinity of the
exhaust valves and the very poor performance of the stock air-seals, I
consider the use of the Corvair-type air-seal a necessity.  When modified,
this air-seal also works on Type IV's. (You need to enlarge the center hole
to accomodate the insulator on two of the leads.)

When Ford of Germany introduced the swivel-foot valve-adjuster they were
immediately adopted by ever serious VW owner.  The same was true for
Corvair
air-seals -- we'd buy two sets (Beldan ?) and end up with three sets :-)

I thought everyone used this type of air-seal.  The stock thingee not only
doesn't work very well, it doesn't last very long.  I think I'll make this
a
public post.  Bad spark plug air-seals are a major cause of overheating.
