914ers,

So the good news is, I finally got the beast fired back up and rumbling
along at 2000 rpms.  After about 10 minutes of this, I started noticing a
lot of smoke coming from under the passenger side of the car.  The valve
covers were leaking all over the exhaust, which in turn was making the
local fire deptartment take notice!

The drivers side was perfect, not a drip.  So what's the secret in getting
these things back on correctly?  I was extra careful when I put them on
before I started the engine including new cork gaskets.  Are there any
better gaskets out there or silicon style material I should be using?  I
also just purchased a set of finned-style aluminum covers for it from a
fellow p-fan (hi Ken).  Do these seal up better?

Thanks for any help.
