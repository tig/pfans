well... i got A new problem for you expert wrenches:  newly rebuilt 2.0
with hyd lifters, 010 crank, new brgs, hi vol oil pump, "pressure
improvement" relief valve installed at front of case, (this case has no
valve at the left side, altho another 2.0 "G" case i have does have the
second relief valve)... oil press is 90psi cold, but drops to 30psi hot
(min spec) at which point the hyd lifters get noisy.. 

bill at Stephens says that the dual relief "E" cases must have the side
valve blocked when used with hyd lifters,  is it possible that the later
case has a drilled internal relief passage or some-such that allows oil
to dump internally? (i admit to never even thinking about this during
assembly)  or is it possible that the hi vol pump is "loose" when it
gets hot?  one of you mentioned something in an earlier post that some
mods were needed on the oil passages for a hyd engine... like what????

additional point: this same engine in an earlier life with solid cam
also had a low-pressure problem,( same pump) ... i just ass-umed it was
the bearings.. tho teardown inspection didn't indicate a problem
there...
