Remember - you can't change anything without affecting everything
else.  Keeping that in mind - it'd be best to plan your entire
rebuild before proceeding.  In effect, you are re-engineering 
your engine and should always consider the health of the system
as a whole.

As far as compression goes, the going maximum compression ration
for premium-pump gas(94) is somewhere between 9.0 and 9.5:1. 
Bumping your compression up would have a minimal inpact on most
other aspects of your engine, but you will sacrifice longevity
in the name of HP.

I rebuilt a 1.7 into the crazy, tweeked engine I have now.  It's
been over a year and I'm still working out all the kinks, but I
like to do it since it's my hobby.  

If I were to do another engine, I'd rebuild a stock 914/6 engine
or an early stock 911 engine with MFI to get more power and a 
faster car.

Just be prepared to spend money that you will never recooperate.
You *will* spent lots rebuilding your engine, especially if you
are going to make performance modifications...
