  This is, of course, the best option; also the most expensive, but not by much.

      .030" is a long way to bore; you may be  starting to weaken the cylinder walls at this point, and a 
new set of oversize pistons will approach the cost of a set of barrels, pistons, and rings.   I have been 
totally unsuccessful in finding stock 94 mm pistons by themselves, except from Automobile Atlanta at 
something like $90 apiece (I think that's about right; apologies to George if I have mis-remembered 
his quote).... I think GPR can get oversize pistons, but whether they will be enough cheaper than a 
matched set of everything to justify the machining is another matter.  That brings up the third cost: 
machining.  Have you gotten a quote for this?  I'll bet we're starting to total up close to a new set 
now... and there's one more thing... I understand loose pistons don't necessarily come with rings... I 
seem to remember that rings go from $50 on up, depending on how fancy you want to get.   Option 
number 2 is probably going to be as pricey as option 1, and not nearly as good for engine 
longevity...   probably not a good choice.

  This might work out OK if you can find the jugs, and if the cost of buying the jugs, plus the cost of 
boring them out, plus the cost of new rings is enough less than a new set of everything to make this 
option attractive.  This is largely market driven, and you will have to make the decision after a bit of 
research.

  The above represent my opinions; it is to be hoped that some others on the list will jump in and 
either corroborate or refute me.... you should get some more opinions before making a big-money 
decision.

  Incidentally, this is one of the reasons that I am trying to find dimensions for stock pistons.  I am fairly 
certain that my old pistons are no good, but my old barrels are nearly perfect; because of this, I'd 
hate to let them go to be overbored .020"... I think that they will work at stock size if I can find some 
new pistons.   Since I am having so much trouble in this area, however, if you can't find any other 
jugs, and you want to go the .020 overbore route, drop me a line and we'll dicker.

                                                  
                                                  Good Luck,
                                                  Jim T.
