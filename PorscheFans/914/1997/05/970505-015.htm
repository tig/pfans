Well, this may not be a big deal to most of you, but it is to me, since 
i've spent a good part of the last few months working on our other cars. 
I finally got both wheel bearings out (with the help of a 3# hammer), and 
I am now painting the trailing arms. The bearing races actually looked ok 
(at least before I had to hammer on them), but the 20year old grease 
looked kinda dry and had leaked out past the seals (did it get hot?). I 
wasn't sure if the bearings were any good, so I decided to replace them. 
I didn't want to put it all back together and have them fail soon 
thereafter. I have a call in to the local bearing supply shop for a 
price, but they have to call the manufacturer, since they don't stock 
them. I'm hoping to beat the usual 40-50$ price I see in the catalogs.

I also cleaned, painted, inspected, and re-packed my axles. I replaced 1
CV joint with a good used one, and the axles needed painting. The boots
looked perfect, so I kept them. I cleaned each CV (and associated boot,
etc) in kerosene, using a small toothbrush-sized wire brush. Then I
sprayed them with brake cleen, and repacked with Valvoline high
performance synthetic grease (it says it's good for CV's right on the
tube). I put new gaskets on, of course. They look like new. I think 
nickname should be "grease."
