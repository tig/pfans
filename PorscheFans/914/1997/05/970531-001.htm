Hi Dave (and all you other Porschefans too...)

  I think I used a little silicone spray to help get the large seals over the injector body, but dry should 
be fine too;  they just aren't that highly stressed.  I'd avoid gasoline, it's dangerous, won't help the 
rubber, and won't stay around long enough to be effective as a lubricant.

  One thing I did the second time I put my engine together:  If you will notice, the smaller seals that go 
on the injector nose have raised lettering on one side.  Since these seals act with one side against 
the manifold and the inside surface against the injector nose to form a seal, it is conceivable that 
these raised letters could allow a small vacuum leak if placed against the manifold.  I made sure all 
of my seals had the lettered surface toward the injector body.  I don't have any idea if this is really 
necessary (probably not), but it sure makes people think that you're a good mechanic with 
extraordinary attention to detail when you tell them about it!

                                                  Regards,
                                                  Jim T.
