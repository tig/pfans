	I think you may be stating it backwards, Dirk.  It isn't that they
had this nifty car and searched for a while for a motor to put into it, and
then turned to VW in desparation.  Porsche was looking for a lower-priced
car to get people interested in Porsches.  VW was looking for an up-market
sports car.  The Good Doctor and the head of VW, Heinz Nordhoff, worked up
an idea for a car that would be both.    The new car could even be built
such that either the VW plant or the 911's motor could be installed, with
relatively few modifications.  VW was in pretty much from the beginning.
	Since the idea would be to sell a lot of cars, Porsche contacted
Karmann about building the bodies.  They had done that with 356es and 911/
912s in the past, so this was nothing new.  The Type IV motor was a natural
candidate for the "lesser" powerplant, as VW could turn out zillions of them
for a lot less than the price of Porsche building a "new" motor.  The 356
engine was probably not considered because (IMHO alert!) it was pretty much
maxed out and any further mods would greatly compromise durability.  Besides,
VW had this nifty new motor that was pretty darn good, all things considered.
	Unfortunately, Nordhoff died before the plans could go anywhere.
Kurt Lotz, Nordhoff's successor at VW, changed the deal that had been struck
by Porsche and VW (on just a handshake).  In the meantime, VW had also taken
over Karmann.
	But that's starting a whole 'nother story.

	If you've looked at any of the "upright" conversion kits, you can
see that the 914s engine compartment has a lot of room vertically.  I don't
think that it would be too much of a problem fitting a 356 motor in.  The
car was designed from the outset to use the Type IV or the 911 Six.
