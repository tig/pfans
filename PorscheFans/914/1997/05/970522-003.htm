Yeah, but the Torsen is a true torque proportioning system, which the 
others are not. The quaife is spur gear type with no clutches - it 
depends on the friction between the ends of the spur gears and the case 
to obtain a limited slip effect. I'm not sure what is meant by the 
"salsibury type" of limited slip, but it is either an open regular bevel 
gear diff with clutch packs added to lock it up, or it's what we call a 
"gearless" differential, which has no bevel gears, just a couple of big 
clutch packs and some one way clutches. 

As a patent examiner, I've been determining patentablity in this field 
for 15 years. I dont' claim expertise in which application is best, but I 
can explain how these things work. The Torsen is the most difficult to 
understand, and I don't claim to fully comprehend all of it.

The regular open bevel gear differential with added clutch packs locks up 
the differential based upon the difference in speed between the output 
shafts. Whether you have one wheel on ice or you are going around a 
corner really fast and the inside wheel slips or you are negotiating a 
very tight corner, the diff locks up. If the clutch pack is set to lock 
up at too low of a speed differential, you won't be able to negotiate 
tight corners because your minimum turning radius (before lockup) will be 
increased. Locking the diff up has a negative effect when going around a 
curve in the road quickly, since a locked up diff will push the car 
straight ahead - just what you don't want to get around a corner fast. 
It's great for mud and snow but bad for road racing. 

The "gearless" differential type is comprised of 2 clutch packs, each
associated with one of the output shafts. One set of discs of each clutch
pack is attached to one part of a one-way clutch, which is also connected
to each output shaft. The other corresponding set of discs for each pack
is attached to the output shaft. The other part of the one-way clutches
are driven by the ring and pinion. When accelerating straight ahead, both
one way clutches engage and actuate both clutch packs, locking up the
drive. This tends to make the car go straight ahead (great for drag
racing). When the car goes around a corner, the outside wheel overruns 
the outside one-way clutch, disengaging the outside clutch. All of the 
engine power then goes to the inside wheel, which remains locked up. Thus 
you go through corners with only one wheel driving the car. If the corner 
speed is increased to the point that the inside wheel slips and spins 
faster than the outside wheel, then the inside OWC is unlocked, and the 
outside OWC becomes locked. Thus all of the engine power is transferred 
from the inside wheel to the outside wheel. If one wheel is on ice or mud 
and slips more than the other wheel, then the other wheel gets all of the 
power so the car can move forward. (same thing happens in reverse). 

The Quaife is a spur gear differential (instead of bevel gears). They are 
helically cut, so they have a thrust component whenever torque is 
applied. This thrust component causes the end face of the gears to rub 
against the case, causing a limited slip effect. Total lockup is not 
possible without some kind of added features like a clutch pack. 

The Torsen is a different animal, using straight-cut spur gears and worm
gears to distribute torque to the output shafts. It is not speed
responsive like the others and does not increase the turning radius of the
car. It relies on the fact that a worm gear behaves as a one-way clutch,
delivering power in one direction only. Each output shaft has a worm wheel
and the ring gear driven case has 3 corresponding worms for each worm
wheel. Each worm is connected to a worm associated with the other
output shaft by straight cut spur gears. Torque is transferred from one 
output shaft to the other via these spur gears. When going around a 
corner, the slower, high torque inside wheel actually forces the outside, 
low torque wheel to turn faster, actually reducing your turning radius. 
If the inside wheel looses traction (no reaction torque) the engine 
torque is transferred to the other wheel. The only disadvanatage of the 
Torsen is that worm gears engage with a sliding motion (as opposed to a 
rolling motion on spur and bevel gears), so that they tend to wear out 
faster and require much more frequent oil changes (every 5,ooo miles).

Hope this helps.
