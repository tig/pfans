I think that the drag that the blades develop are certainly worth a
couple of HP under race conditions. Especially the lowered rotating
mass, that'll help the engine spin up alot faster.

He told me that he gets a full season out of a motor. I doubt the
alternator is there anymore, but it might be. The engine sheet metal has
been cut back so much that only the shroud over the jugs and heads
remain. The sewer pipe fits 'cause he's got a low profile fuel cell in
the front instead of the tank.

28.5 cu ft per second at 4600 RPM. It's for the fan, the book does not
list oil as a cooling medium.
