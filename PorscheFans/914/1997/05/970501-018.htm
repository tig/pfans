Mike we have the complete 914-6 cis conversion documented but as of yet
have not put it all together because of the upcomning catalog workload.  We
will have the complete cis conversion supplenent finished within three
months and will then be more than happy to send you one at that time.  We
continue to modify the 914-6 conversion guide ( we call it "what you are
getting yourself into when converting a 914 to a six") and anyone who has
purchased the guide is entitled to a free update at any time.  The cis
conversion will be added along with the latest aftermarket parts available.
