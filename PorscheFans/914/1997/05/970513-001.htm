  I would suggest that you trouble-shoot this problem in exactly the same way that you would if the car 
suddenly developed the problem after running OK.  
  First, measure the voltage between the engine case and the battery ground post while attempting to 
crank.  Please note that I said ground "post", not "clamp".  Get right on the battery post itself.  If you 
see more than a volt or so, see to your grounding system.  Probable trouble areas are the strap 
between the gearbox and the body, the point on the body where the battery ground cable attaches, 
and the battery ground clamp itself.
  Next, measure the battery voltage while cranking... again, right on the posts.  If this falls to less than 
8 or 9 volts, you either have a shorted starter, or a bad battery.  Have the battery checked at your 
FLAPS to see if it's any good.  Since you attempted to jump start the car with no results, we will 
assume that the battery is OK for now (although you should still make the measurement, and replace 
it if necessary; it is not impossible to have more than one problem simultaneously) and go on to the 
next step.
  For the next step, BE SURE the car is in neutral... you will need an assistant to turn the key for most 
of these checks, anyhow, so have them stand on the brake pedal.  If you suddenly find the problem 
while reaching under the vehicle to get at the starter, you could get run over, so PLAY IT  SAFE!!  
Measure the voltage on the starter solenoid control terminal while attempting to crank.  It should be 
the same as the battery voltage measured above, or close to it.  If not, you have a problem in the 
starter control circuit, which consists principally of the ignition switch, and the infamous seat belt relay 
in the '74 model.  Since the starter goes "click", we will assume that this check will turn out OK and go 
to the next step.
  Next, measure the voltage on the large terminal (upper nut) on the starter solenoid while attempting 
to crank.  This should also be the same as the battery voltage measured above; if not, you have a 
high resistance connection or open somewhere in the large cable between the battery and the 
starter.
 
  If the above voltage is good, there are two possibilities... one is that the starter solenoid or the motor 
itself is defective (replace starter) or that there is a mechanical impediment to the starter pinion being 
driven into full mesh with the ring gear on the flywheel.  You might try operating the starter while 
dismounted from the engine, and observe whether or not the pinion gear goes into full engagement, 
and whether or not the starter runs.  Or, you could take it to your FLAPS and have them test it... most 
are capable, or can tell you where to go.
  If you decide to test run it off the car, two things need to be mentioned:  First, you will need a battery 
jumper cable to ground the motor frame to the gearbox or the battery negative terminal, or the thing 
will not run.  Second, the motor, if it does run, will develop a lot of starting torque, which means it will 
try to twist out of your hands.  Have a GOOD GRIP, and be ready for this.  While attempting to crank,  
measure the voltage on the lower nut on the solenoid..  This connects directly to the motor windings.  
This should be within 1/2 volt or so of the voltage on the top nut.  If not (especially if extremely low or 
zero),  then the starter solenoid is bad... replace the starter.

  If all of the above checks are OK, try it again.  If it still does not work on the car, ask around the list if 
the starters are the same for the 1.7 and 1.8.  I believe that they are, but if not, it may be impossible for 
the starter pinion to fully mesh with the ring gear due to different size teeth, or improper positioning of 
the starter pinion with respect to the ring gear.  If this is the case, it will prevent the starter from 
operating, as the last thing that the solenoid does AFTER driving the pinion into full mesh, is close 
the internal high-current switch to energize the motor.  

  I hope that this is of some help to somebody.

                                                  Regards,
                                                  Jim T.
