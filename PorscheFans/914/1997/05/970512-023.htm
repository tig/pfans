 Hello Nick, 

 Just thought I would though in my thoughts.
  As you know, Im working on my 3.2L project car (slowly) I to have
chosen the 3.2L for many reasons, but mostly for the power and ease of
the smog issue, which my not be an issue, by the time my car is running.
And the fact that I hang out with a Porsche racer/builder and Porsche
mechanic dosent hurt either.
 I always wanted GT flares, but I got them mainly so I could put the
bigger tire under the car to handle the extra power. I drive both my
buddys car with 3.2L's, the car with the one off body kit and the 10
Fuch's in the rear are great, but even with all that meat, it can still
be a handfull ! The other 914 conversion also has the same stock 3.2L
with 15X6's all around, its a very fast car too, but if your not very,
very careful you will hit that RED line in a heart beat and by then your
up in smoke and banging the rev limiter (not a good thing!) He bought GT
flares at the same time I did, cuz he was tired of buying tires. So if
your going to for the big motor, start saving for some type of fender
flaring, you really will need it, and remember, if you go that route,
sit down and do the math first, GT flares $1200.00+Install GT flares
$800.00 + 8's and 9's fuchs $1500.00 + tires $1100.00 your in the 4 to 5
grand range just to have flares.
 Hell, what am I doing ! just kidding.
 If I didnt have my mind dead set on what I wanted and was to do it all
over again and didnt have the $25,000.00 that i will never recover, I
would do a nice 2.4L with all the go fast goodies and some 16X6's and
call it good, and have a very nice conversion. Hell , back when I had
the orig Sixer, it only had the 2.0 and I thought that was fast, and so
did all the Z28 owners that I smoked!

 The Bigger the motor, the Bigger the bill, Later
