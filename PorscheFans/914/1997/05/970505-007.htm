I was playing with mine yesterday afternoon - the throttle was off of
the
car.  I couldn't find any *definitive* reference for alignment of this
device in my manuals (I don't have the factory ones which is where the
answer is - I bet).  

What I did was remove the cover to verify the wires were intact and the
contacts activated in the correct places.  If you take the cover off, it
is easy to see how it *should* work when properly aligned.  There are a
set of contacts on the right which are closed when the throttle is
closed
and should open coming off idle.  The ones on the left close during 
acceleration and open up at constant or full throttle... 

In any case, I'd like the same answers you're looking for.  Ohmeter
readings for each contact at closed throttle, WOT and inbetween.
