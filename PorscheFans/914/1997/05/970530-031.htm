My car sure doesn't turn about the center of mass when it starts to slide 
(that would be spinning, not sliding!).  In my car the center of mass 
begins to move radially outward from the center of the turn.  If the car 
has 50/50 weight distribution then both ends slide the same amount 
producing nuetral handling.  If the weight bias is more toward the rear, 
then the rear will likely move more away from the center of the turn, 
leading to oversteer condition.  (BTW, this is the condition most race 
car drivers like, they can feel the rear slide and can correct with the 
steering and throttle to maintain control.)
