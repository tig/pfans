I had the same issue.  I just fixed it.  Let me guess, if you try to adjust
the idle speed to a higher point by backing off the air bypass screw on the
throttle body NOTHING HAPPENS.  That's because your mixture is way too lean.
Adding more air actually just makes it worse.  The reason why it runs well
when cold is that the cold start injector is making your mixture richer
during that time.  I ended up having to add the 270 ohm resistor to the head
temp sensor (I had the ECU idle adjustment turned all the way up already).
After that, everything is running fine.
