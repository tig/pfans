I think we're talking about 2 different things. PMI as I understand it is 
defined by the distance from the center of the rear wheels to the center 
of mass, and the value of that mass. The two examples above have the same 
pmi, as far as my understanding goes. I think you're talking about the 
moment of interia of the car as referenced to the center of mass, which 
is valid in free space.

I don't have enough experience with race cars to be able to comment on 
this. I was just talking theory with a bunch of simplifying assumptions, 
such as equal roll resistance for all four wheels, all four wheels stick 
until all four loose traction, etc.
