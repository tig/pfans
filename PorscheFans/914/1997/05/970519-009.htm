It's marketing, damnit, just stupid marketing. When the 914 was new,
Porsche tried to make it seem like a "real" Porsche. When that failed and
they introduced another similar car (the Boxster) that they had to
convince poeple was a "real" Porsche, they selectively "forgot" about the
"other" car that was only an "almost" Porsche. 

Porsche was in a bind with a suitable motor for the 914. The 911 six was
too expensive, and the 356 four either wouldn't fit (fan shroud too tall)
or wouldn't meet emissions (and couldn't easily be adapted to do so) or
both. The 911 engine as a four would have only displaced 1.6litres max, 
which wasn't big enough to get enough power. They also lacked factory 
space to build the car and engines, so they turned to VW to get the car 
built and the motor.
