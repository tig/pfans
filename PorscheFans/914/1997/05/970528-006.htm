O.K., I went home and adjusted the FI to be substantially richer, but it
had no effect on the engine's behavior at all.  I've pulled the
distributor, but I haven't loosened the timing adjustment bolt, and I
don't plan on doing so.  Assuming the timing was set correctly before I
pulled the distributor, when I put it back in, will it still be on?  It
seems like there's only one way for it to go in, but I'm not sure what
all can be shifted while it's out.  Examining the inside of the
distributor with the cap off reveals traces of oil and grime, and a lot
of dust apparently worn off of the cap or rotor.  I replaced the rotor,
because it looked terrible, but the cap looks O.K.  So, what's the best
way to clean this thing?  Can I use BrakeCleen, or do I just need to
carefully wipe everything down?

On another note, is it possible to get the fuel injectors to seal
properly with the intake runners mounted, or do I need to pull the
runners and bolt the injectors on first?  I can't see under the runners,
so I'm not sure if everything is lined up correctly.

Thanks again for all of the help,

J.J.
