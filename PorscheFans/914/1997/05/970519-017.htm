If there is still a stub of bleeder in there, an easy-out might be able
to back it out so you can remove and replace it.

I wouldn't even consider AP. If you think the 914 has problems in CSP,
try AP. You're up against a one marque dominated class. The lotus class
as I call it. Loti (Lotuses?) have won the national championship since
1976. And the only non-lotus to win AP was a 914-6. No, keep the stock
calipers and stay with CSP. I think the 914 can be a pretty good car in
local competition. It might even do well at the national level, but
it'll be alot of money to prep the car properly. I'm doing it, little by
little.

By the way, what region do you compete in?
