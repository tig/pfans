There's supposed to be an honest 11hp to be gained by removing both the 
alternator and impeller - with most of that coming from the impeller.  Other 
racers simply start breaking fan blades off to lower impeller drag, and I've 
heard you can run (don't know for how long) with all the blades broken off.

Don't know the answer here.  I know that FAT performance makes some
pretty
tricked-out fan conversions for type IVs though.

I'm confused about this one as the alternator belt is driven by the 
impeller itself.  If it were removed, there would be nothing left
to drive the alternator.  I think the alternator would drain more
power from the engine than the impeller all by itself since the "load"
of the impeller is just the cost of moving air...
