You should have capitalized that sentence about "knows what they're
doing". 

I'd be suprised to find out that any more than maybe 1out of 500 owners
of these type cars have any idea how to make use of their potential.  On
the other hand,  I'd guess that maybe 4 out of 5 914 drivers know what
their cars can do and enjoy pushing them whenever the opportunity
arises.

Lets face it, people don't drive 914's just because of their great
heaters, whisper-quiet interiors, smooth rides, maintenance free
operation, and abundant cup holders!
