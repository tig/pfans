Howdy all,

It's finally time for me to get rid of all the rest of the 914 parts that I 
have.  This includes parts from 4 or so different 914's or various ages.  I 
don't have time to sell this stuff, so it is all going to get tossed out Monday 
nite with the rest of the trash ;-(.  Anyone who is the Northern Virginia area 
(Annandale, specifically) is welcome to take as much of this as you want for 
free.  I  just don't have the time anymore (as those people waiting for me to 
send out brake calipers for 3 months know ;-().  Also, I am changing jobs at 
the end of the month and will be doing alot more traveling - just no time.  And 
I need the space back in the parts loft.

To give you an idea of what the parts look like - when I take a 914 apart I put 
a piece in a zip lock bag along with all the nuts, bolts and fasteners that 
held it together and label it with year, model. Those of you who have bought 
stuff from me know that. All the really valuable stuff has been sold (e.g., 
engines, alloy rims, trannies, etc). But there is a _ton_ of misc little stuff 
still left like:  door handles (interior and exterior), engine sheet metal, 
review mirrors, some calipers, pair of halfshafts, couple of sets of stock and 
higher rate springs, fuel injectors, intake manifolds, wiper motors, 
headlight motors, some rust repair pieces, and all those hundreds of little 
things that go into a 914. If nothing else there are thousands of 914 fasteners 
that would be useful to anyone doing a restoration project.  Oh and for Dave 
Darling there are _alot_ of wiper blades :-) 

I can't sell any of this stuff as I just don't have the time, but I really 
don't want to throw it away either - it is free to whomever wants to give it a 
home. Right now there is a 80 gallon trash can filled with stuff and about 4 
boxes of other stuff outside and there is a bunch of it still in the parts 
loft.  If you want it - let me know so the neighbors don't call the police and 
you can stop by and pick up what you want.

Also, on the btg anonymous ftp server there is a 2.8 megabyte compressed tar 
file which contains all the 914 specific techie-type email I have saved after 
being on the porschephiles and porschefans for 10+ years.  It is located at:  
ftp.btg.com://incoming/noorder/914.tar.Z.   As with any anonymous ftp server 
logon as 'ftp' and provide your email address as the password.  Please don't ask
me to mail the file to you...  The file contains things like Stan's setup for 
an IT car, the best way to move the fuel pump, rust repair tips, and much much 
more.

I have enjoyed the discussions with all of you over the years!  It's been alot 
of fun and very informative.  Hope to not be Porsche-less for all that much 
longer ;-(.

I have signed off the list - so please email to me directly (noorder@btg.com).

Thanks again, Alex
