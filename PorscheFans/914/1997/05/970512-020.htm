As far as "streetability" and maintenance are concerned, go with the
3.2. _IF_ you have the money for it. Remember, your budget _should_
(many of us would say _MUST_) also account for increased suspension and
increased braking capabilities. First make sure you can stop before you
start going fast. So that $15k can dissapear in an aufull hurry. And a
3.2 isn't cheap by a long shot.

As for "too much" power, ain't no such thing. That is of course
considering that you have an unlimmited budget. But let's look at it
realistically. What size wheels are you putting on the car? And more to
the point, are you flaring and what size tires are you putting on there?
I know someone with a 3.0SC motor conversion running on 205/50-15 R1
tires under stock fenders, and he says that he's under-tired. And this
is a professional racer and mechanic with more than a small fleet of
P-cars and _many_ 914s. So I'll take his word for it. So you can look at
that one of two ways: A) not enough tire for the motor, flare it and put
on big meats (read, $$$$). Or B) too much power for the available tire,
use a smaller motor or a smaller right foot.

So keep that in mind when doing the conversion. You'll either want to
install a smaller motor, which will not consume the tires and will also
save you money on the engine purchase. Or go for the gusto motor and
either allocate alot money for tires or alot of money for flares and
wheels. A budget has a nasty way of dashing ones dreams pretty quickly
when it comes to "improving" a 914. BTDT and still doing it.

Good luck and keep us posted!
