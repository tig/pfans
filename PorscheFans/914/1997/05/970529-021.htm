Allan:

I can neither confirm nor deny, but I can guess at a possible reason
for that advice... If you have holes both in the floor and in the
fenders, it's possible that outside air could enter one hole and
exit the other, thereby bypassing the condenser.

It seems to me that you'd still be able to evacuate hot air from the 
condenser through convection, but airflow's a tricky thing and maybe 
it really DOESN'T work well to have two exits.

Personally, I think exits in the fenders may be a bad idea even if
they're the only ones you cut, since the air pressure inside
fenderwells tends to be HIGHER than that of the outside air, not
lower (which is why slantnose 911s have those louvers cut into the
tops of the fenders). 

The very best exit location -- and the hardest to implement in an
aesthetically-pleasing manner, unfortunately -- would seem to be a
vent in the middle of the front hood lid.  Failing that, an exit cut 
in the floor would be my second choice.
