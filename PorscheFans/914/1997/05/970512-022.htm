After the engine transplant, my car now says "click".

While not the best idea in the world, I figured putting a running 1.7L
engine into my '74 914 would get me back on the road faster than
diagnosing and repairing my 1.8L engine.  Installing the 1.7 went fairly
smoothly, but now that everything is together, well, "click".

Turning the key to "run", I can hear the blower motor running.  I think
this is what the car used to do before the engine transplant.  Trying to
turn the engine over leads to a click that is presumably coming from the
starter solenoid, but the starter isn't cranking.  This starter came from
my old engine and worked well enough when all this began.  Suspecting the
battery, I tried jump-starting the car but that didn't help.  As far as I
can tell, the three connections to the starter motor are correct, but I
haven't actually traced them yet.

The 1.7L ('71) came with the full D-Jet system, and I am now using that in
place of the L-Jet from my 1.8L ('74).  I'm not sure how hacked up my
original wiring harness is, but I doubt it was all that stock when I
started.  The connections mostly line up nicely, but I'm sure there will
be a couple problems.

So, questions for the studio audience:

1) Has anyone else been foolish enough to try something like this?  If so,
did you have this problem?

2) Is there anyone in the Seattle area with plenty of experience that
would be willing to help get my car running again in exchange for beer/a
nice dinner/a 1.8L engine core?
