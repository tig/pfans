Otherwise known as "Dave's Big Butt Test." The DBBT procedure is to 
open the passenger door, take the targa top of the car, and have the 
largest person you can find sit in the passenger seat. Attempt to close 
the door and/or put the targa top on. If either of these fails, or is 
even difficult, then the box section is weakened and needs to be 
repaired. To further "enhance" the test, leave the driver's side door 
open during the procedure.

If your car passes the DBBT, you can also test it by jacking up one corner
of the car and see how well the hoods and doors open and close. My car 
passes this test because they all function the same with the car either 
on the ground or with any corner in the air. Basically, a sound 914 is 
very stiff, so be concerned if you see any flexing at all. Use a good 
sharp awl to poke around to find the rotten metal, like it did when I 
found the bottom of the fire wall on the passenger side was as thin as 
paper. Seam sealer is great, but it can hide the worst rust you've ever 
seen.
