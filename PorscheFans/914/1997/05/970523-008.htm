So is it a single throttle body or 4 independent? The setup I'm thinking
of would utilise independent throttle bodies and be computer managed.
Yeah, syncronizing the bodies would be a pain, just like carbs. But the
EFI would be able to deliver fuel much more efficiently, and I could set
it up to keep the mixture from leaning out too much on the straights.
And it would probably run better when cold too.

Sorry, just had to ask. :) Unfortunately I don't think that there are
any NT or Pro Solo events this weekend, so guess who'll be there? I've
seen her drive at the NorPac divisionals, now that is one fast driver.

Hey, I've got a similar problem here. Bob Tunell is campaigning his M3
in my class. Ouch. And I thought Monegans RX7 was the most powerful in
the class at 171HP, now I've got the M3 at 260+HP. Major Ouch. My only
saving chance is that the M3 weighs 50% more than the 914. Yeah right,
like that'll make any difference against one of the best drivers in the
country.

Sounds similar to mine. 
Saturday- SCCA Divisional
Sunday  - SCCA Divisional
Monday  - SCCA Solo Trials
And rain is possible on Sunday and likely on Monday. I'm none to fond of
running a trials event in the rain. At least Stapelton has LOTS of
runoff room. I might just run my street tires if there's alot of water.
Yok AVS.
