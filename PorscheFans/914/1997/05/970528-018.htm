It's just an optical trigger. Since there are 4 equally spaced holes and 
you have 4 cam lobes, it don't matter which way you put it back on, it 
only fits one way. You need to take the top plate apart and clean 
everything up.

If it don't come out easily, then something's busted, so you might as 
well yank on it because you're going to have to buy some new ones anyway. 
Pull it, man! Don't be surprised if your mechanical advance falls out 
when you get those points out, also.
