My experience with the AA fiberglass was that the rear fit OK but had a lot of 
gouges in the finish and the front wasn't even close to fitting (not enough 
curve to follow the front edge of the front lid).  I was referred to two other 
suppliers (one in Michigan, one in California) by satisfied customers, and can 
find their names (I think) if someone needs them.

A friend of mine who has original bumbers has the same problem.  Is this an
occasional factory defect?

I bought the glass bumpers a couple of years ago from Auto Atlanta.  They
fit like crap, but since the car has slowly transformed itself into a track
car, I didn't mind.  I also heard a couple of months ago that AA is using a
different supplier and the quality is better.  Maybe someone else can
verify this.

Good Luck,

Dion
