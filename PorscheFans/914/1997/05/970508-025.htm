I don't disagree with your description, but your focus is on the application 
of power.  My comments about handling were also true: a rear bar increases 
oversteer, which is desirable if you have too much understeer (which is a 
not-too-useful side effect of a LSD).  To me, the application of power earlier 
in a turn and subjective comfort with various handling traits are of equal 
importance - there isn't just one "main" reason for a rear bar, there are at 
least those two.

Michael:

I'm probably just nitpicking, but the main reason for only putting a
rear swaybar on an LSD-equipped car is this:

The swaybar will necessarily lift the inside wheel in a corner.

If you have a limited-slip dfifferential, this is no big deal... It
will direct the engine torque to the wheel that's still on the
ground. 

If, on the other hand, you have an open (i.e., non-LSD) differential,
all your engine torque will go to that inside wheel and it'll just
spin uselessly.
