No, it tends to accumulate at the mouth of the bore; but remember when you
add fresh pads, that the static position of the pistons is 'deeper', and
the rust migrates even further into the bore [up to the seal, effectively].
As the pads wear, the pistons 'rise' out of the bores, at rest; until
sooner or later, you've got pistons trying to operate over the rusted 
portion, and a sticking parking brake. So I figured the only real 'rebuild'
would be a complete cleanup, starting the rust cycle over again. I used 
a 600 grit wet cloth, and lots of brake fluid as a cleaner.

It also applies to the piston seals, unfortunately.
