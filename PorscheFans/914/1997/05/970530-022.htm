Why would anyone want a 50/50 weight distribution? I think it's a marketi=
ng
fallacy.

When a car goes around a corner with all four wheels sticking, the car =
turns about the point between the rear wheels. When a car is sliding on =
all four wheels around a corner, it turns about the center of mass. If =
the center of mass is in the exact middle of the car (as in this theoreti=
cally ideal 50/50 weight distribution), then as the car transitions from =
sticking to sliding, the center point of rotation moves from the point =
between the wheels to the middle of the car. This will upset the cars att=
itude (direction of pointing).

If the center of mass is further back in the car (toward the rear wheels)=
, the distance that the center point has to traverse is less, thus causin=
g less of an upset in the car's attitude from sticking to sliding. Cars =
with lowest polar moment of interia (determined by the distance from the =
center of mass to the center of the rear wheels) are the most stable in =
transitioning from sticking to sliding.

I'm assuming of course, that all four wheels are either sticking or slidi=
ng at the same time, which isn't always the case. This is another way of =
saying that I'm assuming the roll resistance is the same for the front =
and back. Obviously, roll resistance is adjustable by choosing spring rat=
es and sway bar diameters. I would also tend to think that ideally all =
four wheels would stick up to a point where all four wheels would slide =
at the same instant. This seems to tell me that this would lead to the =
maximum traction through a turn with a given set of tires, and that this =
situation is the desired goal in choose spring rates and sway bar diamete=
rs.

There are other issues involved in weight distribution including turn-in =
responsivness and tire loading, also.
