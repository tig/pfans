Your main goal then is to help the new rings get seated.  I think
your correct in avoiding the 20min@2000RPM burn-in and subsequent
oil-change as you didn't crack your case and replace any bearings,etc.

Get it started, get it timed and tuned and follow the next step which
is a short 30 mile trip at *varying* RPM levels to help the rings seat
then back to homebase, let sit and oil change (it can't hurt).  

You may want to check for valves at this point, but since you didn't
mess with the valve train you may be ok in this department; it's your
call.

Then do 300 more miles the same way to finish seating the rings.  Change
oil and check valves.  This is what *I* would do...
