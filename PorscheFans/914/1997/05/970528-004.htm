I got one of my new rear wheel bearings installed last night. I used a 
special tool of my own devising. Using a hammer to install these things 
is not something I was comfortable with, even when I used an old race as 
a driver. 

Basically, the tool uses a threaded rod to press the bearing into the arm.
Square steel tubing was used as a brace on the backside of the trailing
arm and as a pressing member on the front (bearing) side. I found that a
single piece of the tubing wasn't strong enough as a brace on the back
side, so I had to double up there. Another problem was that the edge of
the axle tube on the inside isn't parallel to the bearing seat, so I had
to add a prop between the brace and the trailing arm to make the whole
thing square. I created it using a 2 foot piece of 1/2"  threaded rod and
6 foot piece of 1" box section steel tubing, plus some nuts and washers. 
I cut 2 pieces off of the tubing, one about 1.5 feet long, the other about
8 inches. I drilled a 1/2" hole in all 3 pieces (square and in the middle
of the tubing). The hole for the short piece is in the middle, and for the
other two is near the end. Take a nut and a washer and spin the nut onto
one end of the threaded rod about 4 inches in, put the washer on, then the
short tubing piece, then the long piece. Take another washer and put it on
the same end, then finally a nut. Take 2 wrenches and tighten the 2 nuts
very tight. The idea is to prevent the rod from turning. What you should
have now is an "L" shaped thing with a threaded rod protuding at 90degrees
from the tubing. This goes on the back side with the threaded rod 
sticking through the trailing arm to the front (outer) side. Remove all 
rust and paint from the bearing sleeve area (you did paint the trailing 
arm while you were in there, didn't you :) and put a very thin coat of 
anti-seize on the area (make sure it's grit free first). With the bearing 
lined up square with the sleeve and the threaded rod protruding through 
the middle, slide on the third piece of tubing, a couple of washers and 
another nut (put some grease on the threads beforehand). Now, you're 
going to have to "jiggle" things a bit to get everything lined up and 
square. The idea is to tighten the nut and press that bearing into the 
arm. You may have to hold the outer third piece of tubing so that the 
inner race doesn't turn while the rod is tensioned. You're also going to 
have to find a prop to get the back brace perpendicular with the axis of 
the bearing - I used a spare nut lying around. Once everything is lined 
up and the prop is place, crank on the nut to press the bearing into the 
arm. What I noticed is that I would turn the nut a bit and the bearing 
would then "pop" a little, turn the nut some more, then another "pop", 
etc, until it was all the way in. Granted, this is a primitive tool, but 
at least I graduated from the Neanderthal "bigger hammer" method to 
something a little more refined.
