This "tech" has obviously not had too much experience with R1s lately.
Yes, when R1s first came out, this did occur. It was called the "Groove
of Doom", or EGOD for short. People falsely assumed that the stiff
sidewall construction of the R1 would allow lower pressures and better
contact patch behavior. The problem is, that the sidewall construction
is designed to create an optimal contact patch at normal pressures. With
the pressures so low, teens and low 20s the carcas would then flex too
much and overheat the center tread block. But this did not happen to
everybody, but the common threads were excessively low pressures and
_unshaved_ tires. I run unshaved tires, but I run at moderate (27 lbs)
pressures. The shaving for track events is rather crucial, if tires are
unshaved for a track event, the heat retained in the tread block is too
high and you wind up "boiling" away that section of the tread. The
center tread block was most succeptable, due to the fact that it was so
narrow, and it would squirm alot under high speeds or high lateral
loads. This of course is really not much of a problem anymore. For a few
reasons. One, people learned that the tire responds better to moderate
pressures. Two, people learned that shaving is a _good_ thing,
especially for track use. And three, BFG did do some minor redesign of
the tread (or so I recall) and widened that narrow block.

The guy who DESIGNED the R1 is on the national autox mailing list and
occasionally sends updates on tire developments and tech breifings and
the like.

So to the "tech" who tried to sell you Toyo's, I say "Bull twinkies!".

If the R1 was such a bad tire, then why do so many national champions
run on them?

As for the Hoosiers? They are arguably stickier than the BFG. But they
are a very different tire. My experience is that most people burn up
their first set in a hurry, trying to learn the tire. Some people claim
that they should run a much higher pressures, others claim that they
need more negative camber. The opinions abound. There just aren't enough
numbers of drivers on Hoosiers yet to get a good basis of opinion. But
I've ridden as a passenger on a car that ran on R1s, and then rode when
it was shod with Hoosiers. And they stuck like f*ing glue! The only
consensus on Hoosiers is that they cost more and don't last as long.

Persaonally, if I had the budget, I'd give the Hoosiers a try. But my
tire budget is rather limited, and as such I'm sticking with what works
for me right now.
