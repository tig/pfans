Ditto! :) I read alot and call alot of toll-free number for race prep
shops and techs and the like. If I could, I'd probably become a
professional shop-rat. But right now I havn't seen many job postings for
that position.

That's news to me. But I've never seen the guts of a Gleason-Torsen
unit. So I don't know.
 
[snip] great description of the Torsen guts.

Sounds spot on to me. Except it's six pairs of gears not three.

Yes, and I just recently learned that the only type of diff to deliver
power with only one wheel loaded is a "detroit-locker" and is not a good
diff for road racing applications. In other words, most every type of
LSD requires a reference torque to drive the slower wheel. Even the
salisbury clutch type diffs. I just talked with Gary Taylor at Tylor
Race Engineering , they make leightweight adjustable salisbury type
diffs. And when I say light, I mean 7lbs light! And he told me that all
LSDs require a reference torque. His recomendation for the 901 
gearbox was actually a Quaife, not even his product. Well color me
stupid. Not only that but he can get 'em cheaper than advertised prices.
He said $1400 was what he could sell 'em for.
