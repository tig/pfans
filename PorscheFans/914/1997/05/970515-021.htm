I was recently talking to a tech at DeMoore Tires in Atlanta. He said he 
would never touch a BFG R1 because of it's "killer groove" problem. It 
goes like this: R1 sidewalls are so rigid that instead of the whole tire 
shifting over during a hard corner, the tire compresses instead, causing 
the center to bulge out and thus causing increased wear in the center of 
the tread and narrowing the contact patch. He said he's seen cars crash 
during roadraces because of this. I'm currently running R1's and like 
them for autox but will need a new set soon. This guy's trying to sell 
me some Toyo RA1's or some Hoosiers instead. Has anyone out there ever 
heard of or experienced this problem? TIA,

        Mark:

        I believe your salesman friend is overstating the problem a bit.  What 
you're describing is the well known 'Groove of Doom," and occurs when R1's are 
rather severely underinflated.  Some racers were using them at pressures in the 
teens and low twenties, and BFG went to great lengths to explain why pressures 
this low were causing the problem.  As long as you keep the pressures in the mid
to high 20's or above, you'll be fine.  Hundreds of us on this list run R1's 
without encountering the groove of doom problem.  I myself run them all of the 
time, track and street.  As for crashing, I think it's unlikely, unless some 
yutz was simply not paying attention to how much his tires were worn and simply 
wore the centers down into nothing.

        Hope this helps.
