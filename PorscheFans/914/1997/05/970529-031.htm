My concern is not over-cooling (_that_ can be regulated electronically),
but UNDER-cooling. The electric fan supplied simply does not put out as
much air as the stock impeller, especially when the engine is turning
high rpms, like in a race motor. The stock setup has a 25% higher
delivery rate at 4600 rpm, and it simply gets higher as teh rpms go up.
Yes, there is air being "wasted" in the stock setup by being diverted
through the stock oil cooler (which doesn't exist in this setup), but
that still won't make up for the lower delivery rates at high engine
rpms. For a trailered autoxer, it sounds good, only short one to two
minute runs. But a track car could burn up the engine pretty quick.
Pumping lots of oil through a big 'ol cooler will help controll the oil
temps just fine. But the heads are still gonna get hot without enough
air moving over them. It's an _air_ cooled engine, the oil is simply an
assisting medium, and a reduction in air flow is a direct reduction in
cooling capacity.

I don't think that's the concern at all. I think the concern is rusting
and cracking. I'm sure the fan is more than able to handle getting wet,
I know my fan-forced lid mounted oil cooler handles getting wet just
fine. My fan came off the radiator of a Ferrari. But as long as you
avoid letting the car sit in a deluge, I guess it should do alright.
