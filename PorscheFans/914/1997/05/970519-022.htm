Yehaa! A flying brick! I can think of cheaper ways to get admitted into
the ER... :)

Well I just saw a one hour show on speedvision last night talking about
the evolution of Porsche in racing. An awsome show, I have no idea what
the name of the show was, I didn't want to turn to the guide channel to
check the name for fear of missing something. Anyway, they did a short
piece on the Paris-Dakar 911 that ran in the late '70s. SO, a baja 914
isn't _that_ far fetched.

BTW, if anyone knows the name of this show, post it. It had iterviews
with pretty much every career Porsche racer in history. Way cool. It
pretty much covered 'em all. 901, 911, 904, 911, RS, RSR, 930, 935, 917,
936, 956, 962, 959, GT1, and a host of other cars. Sadly I missed the
beginning, so I can't really say if the 914 was in there or not.
Production, prototype, road going. The works (or is that werks?). Anyway
it was _way_ cool. And it wasn't a glossy prochure type of show either,
it was technical, and described alot of the engineering that went into
these cars as well as the rules that dictaded how they were built. It
finished with the boxter, so it's gotta be a fairly recent show.
