Used staight out? Or refurbished? A used factory LSD is not gonna be a
good deal unless it's _dirt_ cheap. The factory LSD I think is a
salisbury clutch type differential. And these clutch plates wear out.
WHEN (not if) they wear out the diff is effectively open. So the first
thing you need to do is have the LSD inspected to determine how much
clutch material is left, and secondly to determine what it's set up for.
You can set the LSD up for any percentage split. 

As for the street value? If it's a refurbished used one, I'd say around
$2k. They are not as cheap as a quaife. I got a quote of about $3.5k for
a new factory LSD. Pricey sucker.

So how much is your seller asking for?

I'm one too, or I was untill recently. I've been thinking twice about
it. I just read a very good article on LSDs in the latest issue of
SprotsCar, the SCCA monthly magazine. It described various different
types of diffs, and their relative merits and detractors. It had a very
good description of suspension setup techniques with open diffs like on
FVee, FFord, FF2000 and S2000 cars. All of these cars are light weight,
and low power. Ok, so they're all formula cars, but the principle can
still apply. Also, these techiniques echoed comments from two friends of
mine, both national champion autoxers who drive X1/9s. They run with
open diffs, very stiff springs, and a sway bar in front. They control
dive and roll with the front end, and then balance with rear spring
rates. Seeing as they would suffer the same wheel lift problem that the
914 would have if the rear roll rate were too stiff, they seem to have
found a good solution. And diffs are open in theirs and my class.

Food for thought eh?...

Can't afford to drink or smoke. The 914 has first dibs on all the money
and only lets me drink if I win a trophy. :) Not really, but sometimes
it feels like that...
