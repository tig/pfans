I'm going to have to side with Jerry on this one.

Put the motor in, drive it for a while, then take it out and fix it.

Do change the oil first.  Might as well do the tranny too, you probably
don't know when it was changed last.

Plan to drop/fix it in advance.  You may be pleasantly surprised, but
you won't be sorely disappointed.

Otherwise, it's a direct swap.  Even the brain is the same for a '73
1.7 and 2.0.

A 1.7 heat exchanger is better than a late 2.0 exchanger.  But it
probable won't fit, so...  Get the right ones.

Gary.

PS:  I have some spares, and I'm just the other side of the bridge.
