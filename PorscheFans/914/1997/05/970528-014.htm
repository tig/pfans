Hi Brian!

Sounds like the house is all taken care of, and you're ready to start the
car, eh? =8^)

I saw a pic in the reader section of EC that Porsche could have eventually
done with the 914.  It had the front bumper section from a 944T, complete with
fogs, etc.  Didn't see a side view, but it looked nice, and there were sufficient
vents for oil cooler, cool-air brakes, or whatever else you might want to fit.
I think with a 916 tail, and some SC flares, that a 914 would look nice (purists,
the yak bags are in the pocket of the seat in front of you....).  I debate whether
the turnsignals should be shaved off and integrated into the bumper.  And some
C2 offset type wheels would probably round things off.

In terms of an interior, have you seen pics of Craig's car?  It's on the web,
and done *very* nicely......

As for mine, I'm going pretty plain-jane conversion, with GT flares, rockers,
and a small rear lip spoiler.  I'm thinking of ditching the chrome bumpers
and fogs for some 'glass ones though, with some '94 Integra headlights in
place of the fogs, and the stock headlight openings covered with a 'glass
hood.  (Yes, I am an Infidel....)

Mike
