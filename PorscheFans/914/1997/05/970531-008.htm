Hi David,

From what I understand, the pieces are *almost* a direct swap.  The front
suspension & brakes is a fairly straightforward job.  

You just un-bolt the 914 setup, and keep the "pinion input shaft."  It's
the same shaft, but a different length.  Then bolt up the complete 911
suspension:  a-arms, struts, brakes, rack, and the aluminum cross member. 
I'd check the condition of the shocks, and pick the best shocks out of the
2 sets to plug into the 911 struts to go into the 914.  And I'd put in some
rack spacers, and lower the car at the same time.

On the later model 911's, you gain an aluminum cross-member that holds the
a-arms together (ie, lose some weight) and fatter torsion bars, and, of
course, the brakes.  I'm not sure what the early model 911s have that we'd
want.  

The rear brakes?  The most popular mod is just to install studs in your
rear hubs to fit the 911 wheels.  The early 914 hubs have the 5 "pads" for
the machinist to *precisely* drill for studs.  The later (73+) cars do not
have this feature.

The 69 911T engine in the 914/6 is a 2.0, 110hp engine.  Dunno what the 67
has, but I'd imagine it would be the same.  There's lots of info re engine
swaps, but the main things are the sheet metal, oil tank, front engine
mount (get the "fire-wall" mount) and the heat exchangers.  However, I
don't know if *I'd* build a 2.0 914/6.  I'd probably source a 2.4 or
something, and sell this engine+trans to a VW Bus owner :)

cheers, Brian
