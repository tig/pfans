Understeer (what you've described in tight turns) is usually aggravated by a 
stiffer front bar.  As your car leans outward in the turn, the the swaybar 
causes the car chassis to unweight the inside wheel, putting all the cornering 
duties on the outside tire which usually can't take all that demand, so it 
slides and the front "washes out" or "pushes."

If your front bar is adjustable, try moving the downlink more toward the ends 
of the adjustable part.  As much as anything, though, the "best" setup is the 
one you enjoy because what may in fact be a neutral setup may seem too 
tail-happy to a given driver and not loose enough for another.  The car/driver 
system must be "adjusted" together.

In response to Jeff L.: many people have told me to just unhook it from
each end and secure it with wire so it doesn't flop around. This way
it's easy to hook back up if oversteer becomes a problem. I just
unhooked mine but haven't autoxed like this yet. The other 914 autoxers
I've talked to unanimously agree to keep it unhooked with my current
setup. I do well in acceleration and slalom but tight 180's are where I
have problems with pushing through my front tires instead of turning.
This is where I lose the most time because I have to slow down so much.
I'll see if unhooking the rr bar corrects this understeer or if I also
need to tweak my alignment and get a fatter front bar. Good Luck,  
-Mark
