After reading the post by Rich Johnson about electric fans for racing, I
was wondering what does the stock fan produce in CFM?  I understand it is
RPM releated number, but if someone has the numbers I would appricate it.

Also way back when Bruce Anderson wrote an article on 914-4 racing prep
for the SCCA races back in the early 70s.  They removed all the fan
implerors, except the four main braces for the alternator belt pulley. 
Does anyone know how long those races where?  Was it a 10-15 lap sprint
race, or where these things 30-60 minutes long?  If it was a sprint race
I could see doing that for the extra HP, but if it was longer, I think
that the temps would be way to high for running.  Insight into these
early racers is more of a back ground interest, not that I am planning on
running one this way.

Take care,
