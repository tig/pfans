Give Crutchfield a call, some where I have the specs as far as mounting
depth, protrusion, and the like.  But I got them for Crutchfield, they
had a couple of speakers that fit the space well, one by MB-Quarts and
the other I think was Blau.  Both had decent freq. response and both
where somewhat reasonable in price.  Coupled with a nice high power head
unit or separate amp and crossovers, with a Bazooka tube, or the custom
box in the passengers foot area.  And off you go with good tunes, but
then a 914 is not a good audiophile car.  But then the 914 does stimulate
the other senses substantially well enough to make the radio a piece of
background entertainment.  Kind of like a good sound track to a movie,
you know it is there, but it only enhances the total experience.  It does
not distract or diminish your enjoyment, only enhances it.

Take care,

>>Hello all,

 I am to the point of putting the sound system back in my 914 and have a
question. What size speaker can I put in the factory speaker grills? My
car had speakers in the door panels but now I have new panels to =
install.
What is the solution? I have noticed that Automotion advertises some =
sort
of adapter plate with round speakers in it. Are these any good? Has
anyone ever made their own setup like this? I am not an audiophile but I
do have a nice CD unit to install. Any feedback would be helpfull!

Thanks,
Bill =20
