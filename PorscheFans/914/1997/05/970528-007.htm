Hi All,
  Need some creative input on what the factory "might have done" if they built
a '76 914-6.  I have the following ingredients:

1  '76 914 2.0 Bosch-D intact (just passed CA emissions)
               San Francisco Bay Area car from day 1, rust under battery only
1  '73 911  Front Suspension + Brakes + 19mm Master Cylinder (rebuilt in March)
1 set '73 914 trailing arms and rear hubs (not the 4or5 boss versions of '72)
1  '83 911SC 3.0 engine complete with CIS and Stainless Heat Exchangers+Exhaust
     and CAT, 45K original miles
1   Father who is a retired machinist w/ full shop and TIG welder
1   Mechanical Engineering Degree, & lifetime of wrenching on Beetle-to-'Benz
1  Life long ambition to own a killer 914/6

 I need to meet 1983 emissions for this car since the engine is newer than the
car so the CIS and CAT stay.  What might the factory have done in 1976 if they
built a 914/6?  I've seen the Auto Atlanta 3.0, but that was a '72 or '73 914.
I am very familiar with 916 and the GTs of '69,'70,'71,and '72 and I'm not in-
terested in building a "replicar".  I'm wondering what Porsche designers would
have created in 1975 for the '76 model year?  Assuming this car would still be
positioned below the 911 (okay, I know the 2.7 was standard in '76, but help me
please on this rift) what would the interior be like? the wheels? the styling?
Would appreciate any creative input for this FANTASY-TO-REALITY project.
