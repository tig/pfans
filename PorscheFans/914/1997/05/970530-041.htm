Actually the 911 and 914 Koni insert for an original Boge strut are
dimensionally the same. It is fairly common for us to sell the later style
911 Koni gas inserts for the earlier 911's (69-74) that would normally use a
hydraulic, non-externally adjustable unit.  This is only a direct drop in
replacement for original Boge struts.  On orignial Koni struts we can
machine/modify a Koni gas externally adjustable insert to fit, it is not a
direct drop in arrangement.  Although the 911 and 914 inserts are
dimensionally the same, their valving specs are different.  A 911 should use
the 911 insert.  A 914 with 911 struts should still use the 914 insert.  The
later style Koni insert is available in both standard red and sport yellow
valving. The later style standard red valved unit will still be firmer than
the original hydraulic red application as the later cars became much
heavier.  In a sense, the later style standard red unit will be like a
"sport valving" for an early car.  If you really want firm units on a early
car you can use the sport yellows.

Moving to the rear. Koni's later style unit (75-89) is a standard adjustable
gas unit available in both standard red and sport yellow valving.  These
units can also be used as direct bolt on on 72-74 cars and on 65-71 cars
with adapters.
