Better to spray just a little at a time.  If you spray Liberally you will
find a big leak but probably not a little one.  I was having problems with
my Thing and suspected a leak around one of the carbs.  I was spraying it
all around but couldn't find anything.  Finally took it to the mechanic I
use when I can't do it.

He used starting fluid and sprayed it very slightly around and found a
slight leak around the left carb intake manifold/head gasket.  He told me
that if you spray too much, after a couple of shots it will soften the
gasket enough to seal a small leak.  I'd been fighting this off and on for
2 months. He found the problem in 1 minute.
