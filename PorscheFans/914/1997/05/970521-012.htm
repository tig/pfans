Water-cooled! Thou speakest heresy. So this is just between you and me ;-)

You might also consider the newer Subaru engines.  These have been a
popular choice in the Type 1 world for a water-cooled conversion.  The
newer ones are fuel injected, some turbo versions, 4 cylinder but think
there are some 6 cyl.  I think some go over your 150+HP desire. I know
Kennedy has a conversion plate for Subaru to Type 1 tranny.  I briefly
toyed with this idea a few years ago for the Thing. Didn't and haven't kept
up with the latest on Subaru engines.
