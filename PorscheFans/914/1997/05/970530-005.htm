O.K., I reinstalled my cleaned up distributor last night, and
fortunately, the car started fine.  It still exhibits the same behavior,
though.  One thing I did notice that was a little strange was that if I
back the idle adjustment screw off about two full turns (turning it
counter-clockwise), the idle drops from 2000 to 1800.  Not a big deal,
but it seems kind of backwards if the Haynes manual is correct.  Anyway,
I decided that it was time to check for vacuum leaks.  The problem is
that no matter how prepared I get, I'm quite frightened by the procedure
of spraying flammable fluid over the engine.  So, I checked every hose
(they all look good and tight), and decided to re-do my fuel injector
installation.  I'm going to pull the intake runners with the injectors,
and inspect them as I install them to make sure they're seated correctly
and sealed tight.  Then I'll reinstall the whole assembly and reconnect
the fuel lines.  That'll also give me a chance to make sure I'm not
pinching the engine tin underneath the plastic block between the runners
and the heads.  I'm really hoping that this will do it (or at least make
a difference), but I'm not getting my hopes up.  Is there anything else
I should check before I risk catching the engine on fire?

Thanks again,
