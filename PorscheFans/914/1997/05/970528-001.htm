Why not have the point on the targa bar be the one you unclip and have
the net swing out with the door. Unless your door is fully blocked, then
it really doesn't matter which end is hooked up, you still have to climb

My goal as well, but fortuanetly I don't have quite as large a gap to
close up on. I'm down about 2 seconds to my local competition.
Nationally, oof... that's more like 3-4. Best of luck Mike!
