I was glancing through my original 914 factory manual, and noticed two
interesting things.  I can't find the original message, but I remember
someone posting a message regarding the manual from a 550.  The 914's
manual is also titled "Driver's Manual", not owners.  O.K., for the
second observation, we have to remember the previous discussion of
Porsche's claim that the Boxter is the first mid-engined roadster in 40
years.  I think the consensus was that this was O.K., because the 914
isn't really a roadster.  Well, if this was the consensus, then there's
a small contradiction.  The 914 Driver's Manual refers to the 914 as a
roadster!  So, we've got a Porsche publication that calls the 914 a
mid-engined roadster, and then we've got Porsche apparently "forgetting"
the 914 now.  I don't want to start a war, but I just think it's a
little fishy...
