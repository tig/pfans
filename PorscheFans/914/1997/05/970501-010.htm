Josh,
At one time I had intermittent power loss on my 76 914 2.0 (D-jet).
Engine would die abruptly then refire just as abruptly a couple
of seconds later. Very intermittent but gradually got worse.
Turned out to be cylinder head temp. sensor so you might check that.

I believe there is a quick test where you can disconnect lead
from sensor and attach lead to ground - if problem goes away it's
the sensor. There is also a more scientific test one can make with
an ohm meter but I don't have the pointer handy. You should check
procedures for both tests before proceeding though.

Good luck,
Alan

Subject: Dizzy ground wire...

Hey all,

        Well, I think I may have found a source for my repeating sudden
power loss problem. The copper braid ground wire in the dizzy is broken
at the solder joint. This at least may be the problem of minor
intermittent bucking as the throttle eases off to fully closed. As for
the every-minute-or-so total power losses that come back after about
10-15 seconds, that's hard to say. 

        Now I remember a few folks recently talking about just this
problem and what it could lead to. I know the dizzy is going to have to
come out, but is there going to be any serious reconstruction
neccessary? I'm in a bit of a bind right now. My parts bin is nothing
like it used to be, and my parts sources are not as close by as they
used to be. If the dizzy is coming out, I will finally replace the FI
points which I have been putting off, but what I'd like to know is if
there is anything else that I should really be doing to the dizzy as
long as it's out and being worked on.

        I would really like to have the car ready by this weekend's
autox.

Thanks,

-Josh2
