It worked! The 320i calipers bolted right up to the stock mounts on my
'70 914. Had to shave some metal off the lateral part of each caliper to
make them fit inside the wheels and this is with .25" spacers. This
seems to be the only glitch in what is otherwise a direct bolt-on
upgrade. The braking increase is phenomenal. My mechanic thinks it's
even better than his pristine stock '70 914-6. One question remains
however. Is my stock 914-4 proportioning valve adjustable or do I have
to go aftermarket? How much should I adjust it?
 The overall cost for this upgrade was minimal. I bought some beat-up
core 320i calipers off a wreck for $15 each then traded them in at NAPA
for some quality rebuilds at $44 each, pads and all. The labor took
about an hour and 15 minutes. Quite the bang for the buck deal.
