You really won't see smoke when you're lean. Unless you're so lean that
you're burning the valves and pistons. You'll see black smoke when
you're running too rich. And just because you don't have the cold start
injector doesn't change the fact that when the engine is cold the FI
goes to full rich anyway. You may have a failing head temp sensor, then
again you may not. Try all the above and previously mentioned stuff
first to breath life back to the motor. 

Good luck!
