I really try not to stereo-type people, but I'm coming to the conclusion
that all used car salesmen at small, private car lots are the scum of
the earth.  (Sorry to take up the band width, but I just had to tell
this story.)  So, without further ado, here's yet another tale of
pending doom for some unsuspecting customer:

There is a small used car lot just down the road from me that appears to
specialize in older Corvettes, fancy Jeeps, and an occasional Porsche.
I always look as I drive by because all their cars look like real
beauties - shiny, great looking and I think to myself, "Wow.  These guys
must really be good to always have such pretty specimens."

Well the other day, I drove by and spied a beautiful, cherry-red 914 and
I thought, "I'll stop and check it out - maybe a fellow listee might be
interested or maybe it'll be such a great deal that I'll buy it."  So I
pulled up in my 73 VW Bus, walked over and started looking it over.
Just then the salesman walks out - young guy, cool hair, cool shades,
nice clothes, firm handshake, and deep voice - looks knowingly at my Bus
and says, "Ready to get a REAL car?".  Well, this put me off right away
because I drive my Bus and my 914 because I like them, not through some
perverse misfortune, and have as much $$$ in my VW as I do in my 914
(i.e.. WAY more than it'll ever be worth).

Anyway, back to the car:  The salesjerk goes on to tell me how this 74
2.0 is one of the best ones I'll ever find, how it'll out-run Mustangs,
get 35mpg, has been "upgraded" to dual Webers, has the "very rare and
much sought-after Fuchs alloys", blah, blah blah blah.  I pointed out to
him that the wheels were replicas because real Fuchs don't have 1/2"
recesses for the lug bolts to which he replied, "I think they changed
that on this year model" - news to me!

I opened the trunk - almost no metal left from the rear brace on back,
lots of bondo on the rear panel, trunk lid suffering near terminal rust
in the supports.  Opened the engine compartment and tried to explain to
the salesjerk that 4-bolt heads meant it was a 1.7 or 1.8, not the
touted 2.0.  The battery and tray were actually suspended with wire run
through what little remained of the inner fender wall and you could see
daylight through the suspension console (and yes, the right rear wheel
was sitting at an odd angle).  And the tin/shelf had been cut for a
no-longer existing AC compressor.  According to the knowledgeable
salesgenius, "All 914's have rust in these areas - its really not
important because its not part of the frame and can be fixed for a few
hundred dollars by any body shop".  Apparently he still hadn't caught on
that I knew more about the car than he could make up (which was
seemingly unlimited).

The roof panel didn't fit square, and the doors almost didn't clear the
ledges, indicating severe rust through the rockers.  The dash, seats,
and carpet were cracked/raggy and under the front trunk, you could look
right through to the ground where the AC condenser had been removed.
Neither the front or rear trunk lids fit properly and all the rubber
seals appeared to be original (i.e. crap).

On the plus side, the car had one of the prettiest red paint jobs I've
ever seen (my guess is that it was done in the shop behind their sales
lot and probably had a life expectancy of about 6 months).  The asking
price for this beauty?  "Only $4995.00!"

I felt sorry for the saleschmuck and after pointing out all these
(rather obvious) problems, I told him that I wasn't interested, but that
if they lowered the price to around $1500 that they might not be ripping
anyone off too too bad.  He seemed to take offense at this and told me
that obviously I didn't know anything about these cars and that if I had
any taste and appreciation for 'REAL' cars (looking despairingly at my
VW Bus again) that I wouldn't be driving a VW.  Then he turned around
and went back inside.

If anyone's interested in this great deal, I'll send you the number of a
local shrink.  The really sad part about this whole thing is that some
poor sucker'll walk in there just itching to have his very first
Porsche, won't see past the paint job, and will buy it.  Then he'll
spend another $1000 trying to keep it going over the next year or so,
then find out that he can't even sell the thing for $1500.

Happy Motoring
