I've really enjoyed the exchange of info on these lists. I've done the

brake, wheel/tire, and suspension mods to make my '75 1.8 handle well,

but now it is very under-powered. It's getting kind of old having my

doors blown in by every Japanese V-6 luxocruiser sporting an attitude. I

concur with the philosophy of many on the list that a "6" conversion is

the way to go. If I'm going to invest the time and $, I'd like to shoot

for 220-250 H.P., which would break the 10 lb/HP mark, but allow me to

keep my 901 tranny.



Since I'm not stuck to a certain displacement, what are experiences with

the merits of each? I've seen the 2.7RSR spec (ala Andy's 6), 3.0SC

(Rich J. and Al J.), 3.2 Carerra, and even heard of squeezing in the 3.6

964 (twin plugs would sure be nice). I was also intrigued by Bruce A.'s

description in the May Excellence of a "3.2 Carrera RS" engine based on

MFI with SC case/crank/rods with 98mm P/Cs and 911S cams.

 

While I don't mind investing time into putting together the powertrain

[it's a hobby afterall ;)], I'd like the install to be very clean

(minimal mods to body to make it fit) and durable (it's my daily

driver). From a "bang for the buck" perspective, more CC cost more $$,

but for the same power, the various displacements appear to even out

somewhat (e.g. the 2.7 requires hot cams, headwork, etc. where the 3.0 -

3.6 have good/excellent power/durability in stock form). The newer

models seem to be pushing down prices a bit - this month's Pano has two

low mi 993 engines complete for $7500. Also, I'm working out of a home

garage, so assembly work is fine, but machine work (i.e. case/heads) or

fabrication (custom mounts or engine sheet metal) would have to be sent

out and factored into the $$ equation.



I've read Bruce A's book, George Hussey's treatise (which falls short on

detail beyond 3.0L - It'll be great to see the updates) and been

trolling the lists, but would value input from those who have BTDTGTTS.



TIA,

Gary Wheeler
