I simply can't believe it.  Of all of the possible outcomes as a result
of my attempt to rebuild the top-end of my motor by myself, I never
considered this one.  On the very first try, it fired right up and
sounds beautiful!  I cannot fully express the elation I'm experiencing
right now, but I'm sure there are a few of you out there that have had a
similar experience.  It's not completely perfect, though, so I've got
three quick questions:

1.  I installed the VDO oil pressure extension hose, with a circular
electrial connection sandwiched between the sender and the top of the
hose where it screws in, so I could ground it.  It appears to be
stripped, and so it leaks a little.  Is it possible for me to disconnect
the hose at the engine through that tiny hole in the sheet metal?  How
would I do it?  Is there a better way to get a ground than with a
sandwiched wire?

2.  Wheras the car revs fine, and will maintain a steady 2500 RPM
without missing, it simply won't idle.  Before I took everything apart,
the car had a high-idle condition, so this isn't what I expected.  I
haven't tried any remedies yet, but a quick run down of possibilities
would be greatly appreciated.

3.  Can someone give me a quick once-over on the process of adjusting
the clutch at the transmission?  I think I did it right, but the Haynes
manual leaves a lot to be desired.

Just as a side note;  The message I posted earlier about the sparking at
the coil has been resolved.  A new distributor rotor and hooking the
sparkplug cables up to the sparkplugs (so that there's somewhere for the
spark to go?) results in no external sparking anywhere.

I just have to say thanks to everyone on the list for all of the help
that they've given me.  There's absolutely no way I would have been able
to do this without you!

Thanks again!
