Polar moment is a function of the length of the lever arm from the center=
 of the rear wheels to the center of mass. In front wheel drive cars, the=
 polar moment iis huge, in mid-engine cars, it is small. When a car is =
steered using the front wheels to change direction, the center of mass =
has to be moved through an arc to get the car going in the new direction.=
 The effort required to move the center of mass through the arc is a func=
tion of the radius of the arc and the amount of mass. The radius and mass=
 together form the polar moment of interia. A car with smaller polar mome=
nt of interia will steer quicker through a slalom, for example. It takes =
horsepower to move the mass through the arc, so the larger the polar mome=
nt, the more horsepower it takes to steer the car. Thus, a car with large=
 polar moment of interia (pmi) will slow down more when entering a curve =
than when with a small pmi. Auto manufacturers consider this a "safe" fun=
ction for novice drivers because cars with large pmi will scrub off more =
speed when the novice enters a curve too fast. So, we got stuck with stup=
id front wheel drive cars out of concerns for safety. Also, I think drive=
rs subconsiously like front wheel drive cars because they feel like they'=
re steering the Queen Mary when they're on the road. Makes 'em feel safe =
to steer a big boat of a car, or at least one that feels that way. To the=
 skilled driver, front drivers are dangerous because the car responds slo=
wer to emergency situations (part of "active safety"). Auto designers see=
m to prefer passive saftey, ie, you just plow right into that bus and hop=
e that the safety belt and air bags saves your life. If your car had lowe=
r pmi, you could have steered clear of that bus and saved your butt that =
way.

Us wild types want to go fast through corners so we want minimal pmi. Min=
imal pmi and 50/50 weight distribution (forward/rearward) are incompatabl=
e. Sure, balance the car left/right, but make the pmi small.

If you had a car that used both front and rear wheels to steer, the cente=
r of rotation due to steering geometry would be more forward in the car, =
possibly closer to the center of mass. This could be a very stable way =
of steering with minimal power loss through a corner.

When a car has most of it's weight distributed at the two ends of the car=
, it will tend to continue spinning once it starts to spin (lfywheels use=
d for energy storage are designed with virtually all of thier mass at thi=
er periphery). We definitely don't want this in an automobile. We want =
virtually all of the mass within the wheel base of the car.
