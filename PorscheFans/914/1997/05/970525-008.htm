     To which Joshua Hadler replied:
     
So what. That rice-burner that just blew past you is your speeding 
sponsor! Let _them_ get the ticket, they've obviously got money to burn. 
And we all need every penny to feed our 'teeners eh? And then when you 
get to the twisties, you can imagine the other drivers face as they 
struggle in vain to keep up with this flat little thing that simply 
dissapears. ZIP!
_______________________________________________________
        Oops.  Be careful.  Depends on which Japanese "rice burner" you're 
talking about.  If you're talking about a 3rd gen RX-7, Toyota Supra Twin Turbo,
Nissan 300 ZX (normally aspirated or twin turbo) or Acura NSX, and someone who 
knows what they're doing is driving, it's going to be the other way around.  
I've owned 3 of the 4 of these cars over the last 8 years (all but the Supra), 
and I can confidently assure you that, assuming stock configurations, a 993 (let
alone a 914) would have a slight edge over the Nissan in the twisties, and would
be hard pressed to keep up with the RX-7 and the NSX.  On the other hand, I 
don't know what Gary meant by "Japanese luxocruiser."  I wouldn't include the 
cars I've mentioned in that category, but many who don't know what they can do 
would.
