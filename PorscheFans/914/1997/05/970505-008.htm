	O.K., I'm at the point of reassembling the pistons and the cylinders.
I bought a piston ring compressor from a local auto parts store here,
and I just can't seem to get it to work correctly.  It's got a band that
wraps around the piston and "hooks" into the other side, and then an
adjustable "vice-grip" like handle that clamps the band tight around the
piston.  The problem is that the excess band and the size of the handle
make getting the damn thing off once the cylinder is on all but
impossible.  So, in looking through my Haynes manual, they show this
picture of the one they made.  I ran to my hardware store and bought a
piece of brass, but the longest they had was 12in., and I calculate the
circumference of my piston to be about 11.61 in.  Has anyone tackled
this "Make Your Own Piston Ring Compressor" project before?  Also,
assuming that I drill two holes in either end of my brass strip, can I
just use a pair of needle-nose pliers to "clamp" with, or is there
something better?  
	Man, I hate this part.  I always feel like I'm just going to scratch
the inside of the cylinder while simultaneously breaking my rings.  One
more question...  is it better to clamp the piston and then "whack" the
cylinder down in one move, or is it better to try to gently ease the
cylinder down the piston?

Thanks again,
