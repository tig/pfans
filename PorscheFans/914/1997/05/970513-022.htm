Kind of high in price.  IF it's a targa, and IF it's in 95+ point
condition, it would be worth it.  Nice cars, but I know where there's
a 1968 in 95+ unrestored condition for less.

Electronics?  You mean electrics.  Courtesy of "Lucas, the evil prince
of darkness" (tm).  Opinion:  If you like British cars, you wouldn't
be asking the question.  If you don't like British cars, don't buy one.

I think they're cool cars.  But there's lots of cool cars.  But I don't
have time for the ones I've got.......
