I inadvertently deleted my e-mail with the two gents who were looking for
914's to fix up.  I have a '74 Special Edition which might fit the
bill...I have had the suspension repaired and battery box redone.  The
motor is still out from this, as I have not had time to get back to the
West Coast (Wash state) to do it.  The Imron paint job needs a redo, but
the car was a strong daily driver before the suspension cracked.  "Car
has 98k origional miles, second owner (bought in 75). There are numerous
parts with the car including a new bumper, car and cockpit covers, and
electronic ignition.  Have been very busy with the military
downsizing...from current news reports doesn't  look like I'll get to it
soon.  I would rather see a 914 driven than sitting in a garage, and I'm
sure my buddy could use the garage space.  (He has 4 Porsches of his
own).

If the guys who were interested  want to contact me, my e-mail is : 
Navyair@Juno.com  

Thanks  Jim C.  PS For Porsche 356 fans:  356 rally is this weekend in
Seattle!  Will be broadcast over internet www.356registery.org
