I have been quoted $119 from Select Sales, for a set of Panalight 15"x6"
wheels.  Not sure what the 7" cost.  But give them a try.  BTW, just
because they say they are light I don't think 19lbs is light for a wheel.
 But then that is about the same as a 4 bolt Fuchs, but then I have a set
of 5 bolt Mahles that are 12 pounds each.  Then these are real Mag wheels
as in Magnesium.

Take care,
