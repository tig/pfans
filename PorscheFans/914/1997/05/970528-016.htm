Well, the distributor is out now, so why not do a little maintanence,
eh?
(Are you certain this is the cause of your engine problems?)  You can
now
remove the plate, clean it up and re-install with a bit of distributor 
grease.

Never seen one.  I'd carefully diagram and mark it's current
installation
and be careful to put it back together exactly the way it came out.

Yes, those are the FI trigger points.  They *should* slide right
out.  Try rotating the distributor drive shaft as you pull the
trigger points out.  If they are badly pitted or broken, I have
a spare set of new points you can have on the cheap.

Good luck,
