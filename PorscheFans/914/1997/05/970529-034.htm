I can quote you the U.S. spec for the 914:

Front: 90mm from wheel center to center of torsion bar.

Rear: There is none.

The front ride height is a US DOT thing that was mandated when the car
was brought over the pond. Something about crash saftey or headlight
elevation or what ever. If I coudl install rack spacers on my car, but I
can't 'cause the rules don't allow it, My car would be barely scrapin'
the ground at autoxes!:) But excessive bump steer can be a pain, that
and the fact that I still drive my 914 on the street and the dirt roads
I live on. The car is simply too much fun to waste on only the
occasional weekend.

That's a good setup for fun spirited driving.

Keep the rake. The car will handle better. But if you really like the
level look then by all means do so then. The 3 position perch should
allow you to do that.

Even in simple spirited driving the rake will make a difference in
handling. Try it out. If you're that used to swapping springs, and have
a safe spring compressor, try one perch height for a while, then
another. Drive the same stretch of road and see what the difference is.
I think you'll find the rake suits the car better. And personally, I
think the car looks good with a rake! Not one of those floppy leafy
things either, I mean a good three tined pitchfork type thing! A really
sharp one too! The kind you can just go off and...and.. oh, sorry, wrong
mail list. never mind. 

I think I need one of unka Bart's little green ones...
