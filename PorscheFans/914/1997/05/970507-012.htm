Hey guys (and gals),

Just a thought...

We all know that a given car with bigger tires, all other things
remaining the same (compound, weight, etc.), will accelerate faster due
to less wheel slippage, right?  Is this the case?  According to pure
physics, wheel slippage is going to be a function of mu and the normal
force applied to the ground.  If we add larger wheel/tires, sure the
contact patch has increased, but the normal force applied through a
given area will decrease as the weight of the car has not changed.  We
are talking about motion in a straight line here, not in a curve.
Therefore, no matter how large the tires, the car will not be able to
accelerate any faster.  Does anyone follow what I am saying here?  I was
told that rail dragsters (we've all seen the tires expand upon
acceleration) are only wide to sustain an increase in circumfrence to
aid acceleration and that the actual contact patch is very small.  This
would tend to back up my theory.  You have to remember that even if you
have smaller tires, there is going to be more weight acting through them
to hold them from slipping.
