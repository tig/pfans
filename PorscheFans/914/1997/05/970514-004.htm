Another way to determine which 911 engine to install is to figure out
which was the largest/most powerful production engine that Porsche used
with the 901 transmission. Was it the 2.2litre? 2.4? I figure there had to
be a logical reason for porsche to use a stouter transmission in thier 911
when they upgraded the engine beyond a certain point, so for reliablity,
it makes sense to me to follow thier lead. They wouldn't upgrade the
transmission without a very good reason, since it's expensive for them to
do so, and they have the most experience with thier products.  I'm not
informed about 911s, so I can't say which was the largest engine they used
with our transmission, since I never hope to own a 911 (my wife doesn't
like them, and I can only afford one P-car).
