[Hey, Dirk, please wrap the long lines--my mailer doesn't deal with extra-
long lines very gracefully...]

	I don't disagree with your reasoning, just some of your assumptions.
The situation you have described applies only when all four wheels no longer
grip the road.  That isn't just sliding, or spinning, that is gone.  Too
late, don't bother counter-steering, you're going off-course gone.  This
does not happen very often, even to race cars.  (Unless it's my car up at
Sears Point at 25 MPH, but that's a different story.)
	Most of the time, one end or the other of the car will lose grip,
while the other still maintains some.  I think the reason that most race-
oriented cars have more weight in the back then the front has to do with the
way you correct for front sliding (understeer) or rear sliding (oversteer)
behavior.  When you start to understeer, you correct (in general) by opening
the wheel and backing off the throttle.  When you start to oversteer, you
open the wheel and feed in more throttle.  (Not always, definitely not if
you have "lit up" the rears with too much power, but...)  Most people who
are trying to go fast out of corners would rather lay on the gas than back
out of it when things are starting to go wrong.
	In other words, I agree with Ferg.  (Hey, us Daves gotta stick
together!  Besides, maybe now I can talk him into letting me drive the
Boxster...   ;^)
