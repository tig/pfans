Josh, is correct a 914 is kind of like a Zen garden.  Move one thing and
you up set the balance. A big engine goes only so far, under the
simulator I was not getting great 0-60 times because of wheel spin.  A
LSD would help, but I got wheel spin in first on the 2.4L and it
progressed to wheel spin on 1-3 with the 3.3 turbo engine.  This is
running a base tire that is programed in.  I think I can change he
friction or grip the tirre has, but then I don't know.  Remeber if your
wheels are spinning you are only traveling fractions of an inch, where if
they bite yu get there much faster.  Also the simulator does not take
into account the fact that dumping a 3.3 onto a 901 box would sheer first
gear and make it a really short run.  If you dump the clutch like the
simulator does, 1st would be toast and 0-60 takes alot longer when you
are pushing.  But I have experienced tow trucks that seem to do it as
fast as you want, with your car in tow. 

 Read the Auto Atlanta book on the conversion, it is very good for
background info and tells you what to expect.
  
Take care,
