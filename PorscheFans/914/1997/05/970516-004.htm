Matt was asking about external oil coolers for 914:

It is easy to add an external oil cooler.  Lots of people (Tweeks,
Automotion & others) have kits you can buy.  They include the sandwich
plate (fits between oil filter connection and oil filter itself - only
trick is it drops filter right next to motor mount bar - becomes more
akward to get on and off) lines and cooler itself.    (I bought mind from
European Racing in CA.)  Comments:

1.) Most are set up for placement in back by the engine.   -- This is bad.
It is just too hot back there.  If you do put it there,  you will want/need
to add a cooling fan for it to be right.  Some people run without rear
valance to help airflow.

2.) Do it right the first time.   Don't use the rubber hose they send with
kit,  upgrade to braided steel.  Or buy Aeroquip from your local supplier.

3.) Put it up front.   You will notice that there are little pop out holes
behind front bumper.  They were put there for the 914-6 etc that had oil
coolers put there for performance & racing.   You can either buy a bumper
that has oil cooler cut outs or do as I did.   I cut a slot out of my front
valance (refinished and painted) to get air into front trunk area.  Then,
cut a hole in bottom of the trunk pan so air would have a place to exit.
Fabricated a "box" to hold cooler above whole and channel all air flow
through the cooler.   Air exits behind cooler out the low pressure area
below the car.   You kind of have to see it.  It works great!!!   For those
of us that run in HOT TEXAS,  we need maximum cooling.  This works very
well.   Plus,  it places the cooler BACK from the front bumper,  should you
be play a little bumper pool during a race.  (Hopefully not.)

4.)  Be sure to buy lots of extra sandwich plate gaskets as they are VERY
hard to come by from your local auto supply store.  (I couldn't find any at
5 stores.)  When you need it, you need it!

5.)  There is no problem using these external cooler with stock ones at the
same time.  Most of the good ones have a thermostat in sandwich plate.
They only open up and let oil flow once that temp is reached.

6.)  You will want to add a little extra oil once you do add the cooler.
I usually put an extra quart.  Seems to work well.   (I also have one of
the deep catch (3in round, 1 inch deep) on the bottom of oil pan too.)

This is an important upgrade to your 914.   I did it wrong the first time.
(stuck in back with no fan)  It took lots of time and extra money to redo.
Good luck.
