We were discussing these items last week.  Just wanted to post an
update to the list.  

After inspecting my heads carefully, much to my surprise I discovered
that the PO had install these springs such that they were bolted down
*underneath* the rocker arm supports!  Could explain alot about the
less-than-expected performance of my engine.   In any case, I had to
remove the rockers to get the old ones out which were, of course, 
bend beyond use in their normal installation.

I ordered a new set from Stoddard (they had to order them from PCNA
and I still got them in 3 days - damn they are good!) and am getting
ready to put them it.

I just wonder how much the bastard installation for those springs
affected my valve-train geometry and the performance of my engine. 
I know I certainly wasn't getting all the lift I was expecting from
the FAT 440HP cam.
