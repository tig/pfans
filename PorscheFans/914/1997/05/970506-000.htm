  I don't know how wide your band is, J.J.; mine is about 1.5" wide, and it was a bit of a hassle to 
extract after the barrels are on, but the trick is to use a little bit of force as required, and to not push the 
barrels any further over the rings than is necessary to just capture the oil ring before removing the 
compressor.
  If you decide to make your own, two brass strips can be joined in a butt-lap joint by cutting the ends 
nice and square and then cutting a small piece to fit over the joint on the outside.  Tin both sides and 
then sweat solder the lap piece over the joint.  This should be plenty strong enough for a ring 
compressor, and will then be almost 24" long (less the inch or so that you used for the lap piece), 
allowing plenty of room to go around the piston and enough for two generous size tabs to be bent up 
at right angles so that you can grab it with vice-grips, channel-locks, or some such plier with flat 
jaws... needle nose pliers would be stressed to provide the necessary force, and would most likely 
pop out of any holes in the circumferential wrap part of the band, and you would risk scratching up 
the side of the piston as well.

          Man, I hate this part.  I always feel like I'm just going to scratch

  I sure wouldn't "whack" it... this is a sure fire recipie for breaking a ring.  You should be able to ease 
the barrel over the rings one at a time while allowing the compressor to work it's way backwards 
down the piston.  I used my ample gut to apply force to the barrel while guiding the barrel and ring 
compressor with both hands.  Some wiggling motion is helpful, but be careful not to let the 
compressor band get ahead of the barrel or a ring will "pop" out.  Watch for this, and if it happens, 
loosen up the compressor, re-compress the offending ring, and start over.  If you find the barrel 
absolutely won't move, then either a ring has popped out, or the compressor isn't tight enough.  I 
found that there was a fine line between having the compressor tight enough to hold in the rings and 
too tight to move.  Some experimentation is in order.
  One other thing... my compressor is clearly marked with "TOP" on one edge of the band, meaning 
that this edge should go toward the top of the piston.  The only trouble is that even most removable 
band ring compressors are designed for conventional engines where the piston is inserted into the 
top of the cylinder rather than the bottom, as on the Porsche.  Hence, they have a built-in "taper", 
which is backwards for our purposes.  I couldn't get my compressor to work at all until I turned it 
"upside down" with the word "TOP" toward the crankcase.
  Hope this helps.

                                                  Regards,
                                                  Jim T.
