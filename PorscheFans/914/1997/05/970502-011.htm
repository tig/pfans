Josh,

Sorry about your fuel pump, but at least you will get running.

We spent much time and money trying for months to find an intermittent
problem, I mean we tried everything, and it too turned out to be the
fuel pump. A minor tipoff should have been a slight fuel smell that I 
could not find the cause for....it drove me crazy, and the car would
stall out occassionally too. Then one day we had a real fuel smell: there 
was fuel dripping from the pump! Whenever it leaked, we lost pressure and 
the car stalled.

Also, this drove us crazy at the same time, was a badly built electrical
shutoff-switch-for-racing. Hit a bump: Stall. Go fast around a turn: Stall.
Mike of Powertech, who installed this for us, told me that it was poorly 
manufactured: Put a washer inside to 'tighten' the connection and stalling
stops.

Don't you just love more than one problem at once.

Have fun...

Mark
