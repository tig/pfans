Depends on how well the 1.7L runs and how much you know about this 
newly acquired 2.0L motor.  Was it 'professionally' rebuilt? 
How many miles does it have on it?  Has it been modified? 

Unless you know alot about this new 2.0L motor, just dropping it in
your car is risky.  You may end-up with more power and a nice engine,
or you may discover the 2.0L has problems and it may even run more
poorly than your current 1.7L.

You don't need to do anything other than "out with the old and in 
with the new".  While the 2.0L is out of the car you may, however, 
want to do perform routine maintenance (new gaskets, valve adj., etc.)

If it were me - I'd try the 2.0L, see how it runs, check compression
leak-down and overall performance.  But, being the anal-type that I
am, I'd also be tempted to tear it down and rebuild it, especially
since there is a running engine (I assume) in your car already.

Not much information here, because the situation depends on your 
point-of-view...
