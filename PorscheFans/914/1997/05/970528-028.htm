I have 150# springs in teh rear and really only notice it on wasboard
roads or RR crossings. Beyond that, it's really not noticable on the
freeway. Either that, or I've become desensitized to it. I do like to
softer ride of my Quantum for long drives. But I remember the switch
from stock to 150# w/konis and the ride didn't seem excessively stiff
except for bad roads.

But Rocky, 100# is about as soft as you'll find. The stock springs if I
recall were something like 85# or so. The progressive 140# springs are
just peachy for everyday driving.

Hmm, I guess that after a weekend of autoxing with the konis at full
stiff, the drive home and the next couple days at full soft feels quite
mellow. But that's why I would recomend the Bilstiens over the Konis for
street car. They'll last longer and are a little bit softer. I wouldn't
go for the Boges though, too soft to have fun with.

The suggestion to use the adjustable perches to cure the 'sagging'
problem is simply a way for Automashin' to sell expensive racer goodies
to folks who don't really need 'em.

Yeah, but modern Bilstiens are FAR superior to what Porsche knew of in
the 70s and I've found them to be really comfortable on long drives.
They do cost more than teh Boges however.
