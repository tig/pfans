Lately, I've been reading in several places references to the so-called
"ideal 50/50" weight distribution. I think I saw it in reference to the
Boxster and other cars. Now, I beg to differ in this presumption. I
believe our 914's (and also other midengine cars), with a slight rearward
bias, is more ideal. I believe the 50/50 myth is wrong for a couple of
reasons. The first is that when going through a corner, the center of mass
tends to travel in a straight line. If this center is in the middle of the
car, then the outside front tire receieves the brunt of this force, but if
the center of mass is further back in the car, the rear outside tire takes
on more of the force and better grip overall is achieved. The second
reason is that the pivot point is between the rear wheels, so that
minimizing the polar moment of interia will make the car more responsive
to driver steering inputs. A center of mass up in the middle of the car 
will make it more sluggish than one with the mass further back by the 
rear wheels. I guess the marketeers have struck again with this 50/50 
myth.
