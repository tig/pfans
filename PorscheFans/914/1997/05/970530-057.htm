1] is the switch really plugged in?
2] is the power really on?

if yes to above, you may have a problem. You can check it directly by
hooking a continuity tester to the center pin and the next one forward
(to the front of the car) of it. You should get 10 state changes as you
sweep the throttle open. This will not be the same as when the throttle
is closing. The directional swithc inside defeats teh accelerator
contacts. BTW, you CAN run with the switch disconnected. The switch only
really gives you the added pulses on acceleration, but it won't prevent
your car from running. 

If you have the throttle body off the car, you may wish to look inside
the switch. CAREFULLY pry the black plastic cover off of the switch,
there are four tabs that hold it in place. Be carefull and do it over a
clean bench or counter, there are two small rubber plugs that fit in the
upper corners of the cover. They will most likely fall out when the
cover is removed, so try not to loose them. They are easy to reinstall,
IF you still have them. O.k. so the cover's off now. See on the outer
sweep of the switch? The interleaved squigly contacts? That is what
gives you the 20 clicks. As the sweep contact crosses from contact to
board, you should hear a click (when it's all hooked up) from the
injectors. The next contact sweep inward is the idle circuit and that is
only active on closing throttle. See the directional switch  mounted at
the end of the shaft? 

If your swithc is old, like many of them are, chances are that the
contacts are pretty dirty. Take the time while you're in there to clean
off those contacts. If it seems like one of them is scored, then bend
the sweep contact just a little above or below the line it was moving on
(the scored one) and get some fresh contact material. These switches
don't last forever, but a little maintenance, and bending those little
contacts around can extend the life of that switch quite a bit.

Of course, if you don't have the t-body off, and the car runs fine.
DOn't worry about it. Like I said, it can't prevent your car from
working. It just may make it run a little rough or stutter. If you think
the TPS is a problem, disconnect it. You can run just fine without it.
