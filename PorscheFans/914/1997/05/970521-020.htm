Thwen,

I'd be scared sh**less to leave $1000 worth of wheels/tires laying
around outside.

Why not lay them on their sides (stacked 2 high, 2 side-by-side) or on
their edges (just like they were on the car, but a lot closer together)
in your living room, put a piece of glass on top, and call it a coffee
table!

However, if you do have to leave them where they're at, at least you'll
be the only one on you block with a set of alloys on your Porch.
