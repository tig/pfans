There are two O rings in the pump. If you have a well stocked hardware 
store, you can take the pump apart and take one of the plates to the 
store and get the proper replacement. I think it was a #81 or soemthing. 
After 25 years, they curl up and die. Oh yeah, the new ones are viton, 
should be good enough.
