Yup. Seeing as how this only happens when warm, I'd say this is a
mixture thing. Does the car restart after it dies? Or does it not want
to start for a while. My guess? I'd say it's a head temp sensor problem.
It may be leaning out soo much that the engine can't idle. If that's the
case, fix it ASAP! You could be burning your valves and pistons. It
could alsop be the other way, failing to an open circuit, going full
rich and flooding. That would explain the crappy milage. Look at the
plugs and check the exhaust pipe outlet. Is there fouling on the plugs?
Is there black soot in the exhaust pipe? Then you're probably running
too rich. An open circuit in the head temp circuit will do this. 

Try grounding the head temp sensor after the car has gotten warm and see
if that helps the problem. DON'T KEEP IT THAT WAY THOUGH. You will then
be running full lean and will be at risk of burning things. Just do that
as a test if the problem is an easilly reproducible one.

The head temp sensor is a pain in the butt to replace, but it _can_ be
done in the car.

I don't think that the AAR can cause the engine to bahave like that.
