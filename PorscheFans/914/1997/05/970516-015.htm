Here is a letter received from an individual who I do not know, and have
never met.  His concerns, and statements reflect those of other 914'ers that
seek a reputable and equitable source for 914 related parts and service.

Wow. Reading this group of messages was rather interesting. I found it
surprising (neither good or bad) that the Porsche 914 Club (PC)
management would ask its members and users (hereafter known as users) if
it was okay for a company to advertise in the club. This is different
because advertising is income; why care what the company is selling,
just as long as the check doesn't bounce, right? To let users decide


whether a company can advertise or not isn't your everyday paradigm.

But if you read the initial request it is apparent that management
wasn't sure whether to let Automobile Atlanta (AA) advertise since they
had reservations about AA's customer support. Instead of making a
typical hierachal decision they left it up to the users, those whose
numbers are greater than management and have had the greater overall
experience. A simple, majority-rules consensus is all that's needed - a
very forward-thinking idea for a small, non-profit club indeed!

The responses from the users clearly displays a dissatisfaction for AA
and all of the responses, no matter at what time the problem occurred,
are all valid, just as the good responses are. But to just pose such a
question to members indicates that there is definitely something wrong
and AA, upon learning this, should be duly concerned. I was absolutely
appalled by Mr. Sneed's response, especially the last statement - that
is no way for an executive to be treating a customer. It oozed
defensiveness in a most immature manner.

Mr. Sneed's second reply to the news group was slightly better, but
still defensive and full of inadequate facts. Statistics can be twisted
to suit anyone's needs and surveys are easily corrupted as any college
student knows after taking a introductory statistics class. Also, when a
company truly wants to know their customer service quality by using a
survey they must use the services of an outside, impartial research
firm. These companies have the formal training to design, submit and
process customer surveys and results to get a clearer picture of a
business's operation. The mention of the Better Business Bureau proves
absolutely nothing as many people don't use or know of this route of
"official" complaining. The beginning of the fourth paragraph I must
quote, "I understand your decision not allowing us to advertise on your
web site. I do still have concerns about your dedication to the 914."
The total thought contradiction displayed here is, well, rather
baffling. His marketing ability definitely overshadows his public
relations skills.

I believe what I see the PC doing is simply letting people know that AA
has unreliable, if not questionable, service. They are breaking away
from traditional advertising income support and protecting their
customers, the users, by providing added measure to "buyer beware".
Anyone with a catalog from AA can clearly see their extensive supply of
914 parts and information - it's so complete and written with such
authority that one would expect first-rate service. The PC is letting
the users know that AA talks the talk but they don't walk the walk.

Mr. Sneed, if he truly wishes to change AA's image, has a large and
uncomfortable task ahead of him. Just one unhappy customer will negate
ten happy customers (or more)! Trying to reach 100% satisfaction is an
impossible goal, but 85% - 90% is reasonable (95% is world class and
difficult to obtain and keep). However, I know it is possible to change
the consumer's viewpoint over time and should AA do so they will become
a more profitable and competitive 914 supplier.

Automobile Atlanta, hear the echo of your own statement: We still have
concerns about your dedication to the 914.
