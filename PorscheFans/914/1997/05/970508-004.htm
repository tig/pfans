OK, it's a long title. sorry.

I got to spend some more "quality time" with my car last night. I
installed the Weltmeister oil pressure relief pistons, for higher engine
oil pressure. The hardest part was getting the screw plugs out. The first
one I was that triple square that I had mentioned to the list a few days
ago. It turns out Josh is correct - I used the square drive from a 3/8"
socket drive, *but* it took many foot pounds (as in having to use the 3/8"
drive breaker bar *and* applying enough torque to move the engine a little
(!!)). Ham fisted impact gun crazy mechanics - who needs 'em??? The same
for the screw cover with the long screwdriver slot - liberal application
of a hammer and a screwdriver (used as a chisel) to the outer edge of the
slot broke it free. This was *after* I ruined a slotted impact screwdriver
bit from Sears, using the hand impact tool and a big hammer. (I love big
hammers) Anyway, I used that teflon pipe tape on the threads when I put
them back together, as well as some engine assembly lube on the new
pistons. I also made sure that the new pistons slid freely in the engine
bores before buttoning things up. There are some handy tools that help in
getting the pistons out, my local hardware store sells a set of picks with
different shaped tips (hook, "L", and convoluted), they came in handy for
this job. 

I also removed the oil temp sender plate, cleaned it (brake cleen - gotta
have it, but it tastes real bad (ask me how I know)) and the mating
surface, as well as the O ring (good shape, kept it), and used Permatex 2
on both parts before re-assembling. The plate had been leaking a little,
so I wanted to take care of that. 

I ordered a pair of wheel bearings, rear brake discs, and some misc stuff 
from GPR. You guys are right, they are great, with great prices. Too bad 
they are on the Left coast, while I'm on the right one. I couldn't get 
the wheel bearings through my local bearing supply house - they said SKF 
didn't recognize the bearing number (go figure).
