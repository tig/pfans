	In the recent past, I had some problems with the 
starting/charging system on the car and decided to try a new
voltage regulator.  I went to the FLAPS (pep boys) and they
had one that looked nothing like the Bosch that was in the car
and they wanted $30 for it.  Since I just wanted to try it,
I felt $30 was too much for an experiment, so I went down
the road to Western Auto.  They had  one that looked just like
the one at the other place, but was $15, so I bought it.  There
had  been  some talk of an  electronic replacement for our
voltage regulators.  This is it.   Inside there  was  a  little
instruction sheet that said  something like "Don't be concerned
that this doesn't look like your volkswagen voltage regulator
because this one is electronic and is waaaaaay better  than
the mechanical one you got".  Before I found the note in the box
I was going to cut it open to see if it was electronic or not.
The guy behind the counter couldn't answer that.

	Turns out there was no problem with the car.  The only
bad battery was the one in my voltmeter.
