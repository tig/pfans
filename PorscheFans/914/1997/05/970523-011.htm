After reading Don's comments on the 914 gathering in Solvang I also felt the
need to recommend all 914ers to take some time and attend a 914 event.  There
are several yet to happen this summer and this fall.  I took some time off
work (I can recommend this for everyone) joined a couple friends and flew out
to the LA area.  I have to admit I hold a fond memories from this part of CA.
 I was stationed at Vandenburg AFB for training in the early 80's and think
this part of the coast is just gorgeous.
After meeting some very good friends (Barbara, Alex, Perry & Glenn) I had a
chance to meet some new folks from the west coast area.  It was very good to
get togather again and wonderful to see some of the nicest 914-6s and 914-4s
gathered in one place.  I've already started to make plans for another trip
back next summer.  I don't know if more people will attend next year or how
to one-up the surprise showing of Mike Hagen's Sunauto 914-6 GT, but my wife
and I plan on attending reguardless.  It was a blast!  Good luck and and the
ability to stay away from Buicks and I will be there with my car.
I would like to say thanks to any of the list members who attended the event
and brought cars.  I hope we can cross paths again soon.
Branson MO. is the next event on my list.  I attended a PCA sponsored event
there last year and the people and hospitality very great.  Sept. 12, 13 and
14 the Midwest Porsche 914 Club gathers for more 914 stories, rides and
friendship.  Member or not, 914 or not, everyone with 914 interrests are
welcome.  Point your browsers at http://www.dgi.net/events/midwest.html  if
you need some information on this event.
I hope to see some of you there or at another 914 event.  Possibly at next
years PCA Parade in CO?
