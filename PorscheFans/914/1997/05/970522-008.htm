O.K., I got everything put back together last night, so I decided to try
to get oil pressure before starting.  I pulled the plug wires off the
spark plugs, and the FI wires from the injectors.  As I started to
crank, my assistant noticed sparks aparently inside the distributor cap,
moving around as I cranked.  I pulled the distributor cap off, and
noticed that the rotor was falling apart.  I pulled the rotor off, left
the cap off, and tried again.  At this point I need to mention that I've
got a Crane Cams electrical ignition that I know absolutly nothing
about.  Anyway, this time, the sparks jump from the center of the coil
where the plug wires is, to the four connections from the crane to the
coil.  So, I pulled the coil wire off and tried again.  Now, there were
no sparks while cranking, and amazingly, my oil pressure light turned
off in only 20 seconds.  However, once I stopped cranking, a spark jumps
from the coil to the crane connections.  My question:  Is this normal
since I've got everything pulled apart, or have I hooked something up
wrong?  I checked all of my connections, and everything appears O.K...

Thanks,
