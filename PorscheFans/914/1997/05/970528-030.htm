    Jay:

    Although I've never seen Auto Atlanta's 9014 kit in person (and
    even though my own 914 is a "fiberglass pile of shit" --
    although with Porsche tail lights), I'd probably concur with Don,
    for two reasons:

    1.  The 9014 is more-or-less a replica of the Porsche 904, one
        of the best-looking (in my opinion) cars Porsche ever built.
        Unfortunately, the flowing beauty of the 904 is completely
        lost in the 9014 kit; it has the same character as those
        Corvette "Testarossa" or Fiero "Ferrari 308" kits... Ick.

        Personally, I have no problem with someone wanting to put
        wild body panels on an otherwise-mundane car... I just don't
        understand spending a lot of money to make one model look
        "almost" like another one. 

    2.  Looks aside, it appears that the 9014 kit may have some
        serious structural problems.  Again, I haven't seen the
        thing in person, so I don't know what sort of bracketry is
        included, but that front overhang is EXTREMELY long... If
        it's meant to be self-supporting, I'd give it about 10 miles
        of city driving before it starts to crack.

        The Chalon kit on my 914 has a shorter front overhang than
        AA's 9014 kit, but even so, it took NUMEROUS attempts by my
        body shop to solve the cracking problem.  We finally did it,
        but it took a lot of bracket-welding.

    This is all just my opinion, of course... I'm sure others on the
    list will feel differently.

    George Hussey, Auto Atlanta's President, is on the list, too...
    While I'm sure that he'd ordinarily stay out of a public
    discussion of his company's products, I don't think it would be
    inappropriate for him to post a short message regarding the
    structural integrity of the 9014 kit.
