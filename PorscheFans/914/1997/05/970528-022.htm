Hello Jay,

 I have seen a 914 with this kit installed in person and I have to say it
looks pretty neat. I wouldn't put this on a good 914 but if  youv'e got a
junker with bashed fenders,etc. this would be a good looking body kit for
the chassis. You would definetly  get the looks going down the road. The
pieces are more or less cut the old off and glue the new on. The rear and
front fenders are complete assemblies and it doesn't look like you have
to do any "moulding" in. The light kits that come with the kit are
customized for the body and go well with the look of the 904.
