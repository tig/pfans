Not true. It's entirely possible to have a 50/50 distribution AND a
minimal pmi. Think about it, just because most massive components of the
car aren't in the very center of the car doesn't mean it isn't 50/50 and
the same applies vice-vera.

Example: A rectangle (car) with three section. Front, Center and Middle.
If it's set up with a 40,20,40 distribution, it has a 50/50 distribution
with a high PMI. If you set it up with 20,60,20 distribution, it still
retains a 50/50 with a much lower PMI.

In a Front engine RWD car, it will resist spinning much more than a mid
engined car. And as such, can run loose for a relatively long period of
time without getting away from you. Witness NASCAR, TRANS-AM, or your
average 944S2 in competition. The car can handle a loose setup much
better with the higher PMI. They still however retain that near 50/50.
This is why so many people state that the 944 is such an easy car to
learn how to drive fast. It has a perfect 50/50 and a relatively high
PMI, same with the modern M3.  Now lets look at cars like F1, CART, and
other formula chassis. They too have a near 50/50 dist. but with a much
lower PMI. This gives them the distinct advantage of being able to
change directions MUCH more rapidly, but at the cost of inertial
stability. Notice that these low PMI cars will not allow the driver to
keep it loose for more than a split second. Any more than that and it's
gone. It will spin like a top, and launch into that spin quite rapidly
too, because there is a much lower inertial resistance to spinning. Once
a car gets away from you like that, regardless of its PMI, it's gone. So
recovery from a spin like that is not all too common. The high PMI car,
because it now has rotational inertia to overcome. The low PMI car,
because it will tend to change very rapidly from one state to another in
attempting to recover. In the low PMI car, it takes a driver of
extraordinary skill to recover from a full out spin without jumping on
the brakes. Once you jump on the brakes, the situation is different as
the mechanics of sliding are different than the mechanics of rolling.

As Danny Sulivan says, "When in doubt, both feet out. Whin it spins,
both feet in!".
