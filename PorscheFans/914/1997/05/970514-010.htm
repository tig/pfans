Hi, Keith,

   Common wisdom is that, unless you really like 912E's, you should
probably steer clear.  The fact that only 2100 of them were made is NOT a
particularly helpful thing.  Even though there is a temptation to think of
it as "A 911 with a 914 engine in it," that is not really true; there were
many "one-year-only" parts on the car.  This makes it difficult to keep
maintained.
  To be valuable, a car needs to be rare AND desirable.  The 912E is only
half of that.
  For $11k, you could get a not-so-nice SC or a decent '75-77 911. IMHO,
either of these would be a better deal than a 912E.  The 912E at a
significantly lower price would also work.
