Loathe as I am to make any suggestions to a water cooled conversion, I'd
say the new subie flat 4 motors are a good choice, 2.5 liter, flat 4
motor. It won't be a mamoth power plant, but it'll certainly get you
going better than a stock type IV motor. And it keeps the CG low. But
for american power? An aluminum V8, Buick or F*rd. Get lot's of low end
grunt and it won't weigh down the rear end like a chevy small block
would.

However, a water cooled conversion is not going to be cheaper (if done
properly) than a big six upgrade. So I have to ask, why do you want to
convert to a water pumper?
