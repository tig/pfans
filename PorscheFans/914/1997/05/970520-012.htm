(Mike, I realize this probably isn't what you were asking, but I thought
it might be useful info to someone.)

As you probably all know, every model of tire by every manufacturer is
shaped/sized differently (well, OK, most of them are round).  I replaced
a set of Yoko (A408?) 195/60 with a set of Yoko (A509) 195/60 and they
are not even close to the same size.  The new tires are at least an inch
wider and seem to be about 1/4 inch taller.

If all tires were sized the same, you could figure the radius as
sidewall height + 1/2 wheel height.  So a 205/50 15 would be 205 X .5 =
102.5 cm (approx 4" - anyone know the conversion factor for cm to
inches?) + 7.5" = 11.5" radius

Anyway, the point is, if you want to know how fast you are going, go out
on a state or US highway that has the mile markers on it and drive a
constant speed in 5th gear past at least 3 markers (I usually use 5 just
in case).  Note how many minutes and seconds it takes to cover the
distance and do the calculation:

     ((Minutes X 60) + seconds) / 60 = number of minutes

     (miles / number of minutes) X 60 = miles per hour

For instance, you go 5 miles in 4 minutes, 37 seconds:
     (4 X 60) + 52 / 60 = 4.62 minutes

     (5 miles/ 4.62 minutes) X 60 = 64.94 mph

If you don't have a calculator, but are on a long, boring stretch of
road (like I-10 between San Antonio and El Paso!), try adjusting your
speed until the markers are ticking off at exactly 1 per minute - this
is your 60mph mark (try about 65 or 66mph on your speedo as a starting
point for this - most of them read 8-10% high at 60mph).
     1 mile every 45 seconds is 80mph
     1 mile every 50 seconds is 72mph
     1 mile every 55 seconds is 65mph
     1 mile every 60 seconds is 60mph

And if you start seeing 1 mile every 30 seconds, your car is either
running great or is about to blow up (or both) and you definitely
shouldn't be looking at your stopwatch anymore!
