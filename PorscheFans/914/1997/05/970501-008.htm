	There are manifolds for everything.
	The main reasons for not using carbs are the same reasons for
not using them on modern cars.  Emissions, power, driveability, cold
performance, fuel economy...  All of those are improved with a modern
DME system. CIS gives you all of that except for the power.  (Yes, in
the 911 world, carbs really *are* bolt-on power for the CIS cars...
This from Bruce A. who ought to know...)
	I don't know for sure, but I'd bet that throttle response in a
DME-equipped car isn't *much* worse than it would be with carbs.  You
still have to wait for manifold vacuum to build up (more manifold in
an FI car) before you get more fuel, though the acelerator pump helps
that a lot.  Then again, some FI cars have sensors on the throttle to
tell them when it's opening which acts like an accel pump.

	Maybe it's an irrational predjudice, but I do like the 3.2/DME
combination.
	Of course, you'll have to throw a lot of money at the rest of
the car (brakes, suspension, tires, etc.) to have anything like a well-
balanced car with a 3.2 in it!
