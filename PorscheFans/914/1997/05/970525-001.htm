Based on my personal experience with rebuilding my 901 transmission, I 
would have to saythat "gobs and gobs" of torque is definetly *not* what 
anyone shoudl want. When you have a large amount of torque available, the 
urge to stomp on it in first gear to beat that stop light challenger can 
become irresistable. Having examined several specimens of first gear from 
various transmissions, this is really a very bad idea. First speed is a 
well known weak point in these transmissions, so unless a person has the 
discipline to stay out of the loud pedal in first, get a smaller six with 
less torque and be happy that you don't have to rebuild your transmission 
every 20,000 miles because you're eating first gear. Oh, BTW, first speed 
gear pairs are becoming harder and harder to obtain, and new ones range 
in price from 600$ to a thousand dollars. Here's a hot tip: the best 
place to find good used first gear pairs is from tail shifter 
transmissions. The reason is because these transmissions had the low 
power 1.7 litre engines, so gear wear is typically minimal. Another hot 
tip: get your first speed gear pair cryogenically frozen at CryoPro, 
it'll make them last much longer.
