The rake is to better balance the car.  There is about a 45/55 weight
distribution and lowering the front in relation to the rear puts more weight
on the front.  Lower the rear to about 4.5" measured at the rear "bumps"
that stick down and lower the front to about 3.75" measured at the bottom of
the torsion bar adjusters.  If the front is lowered from your setup now, you
will need to adjust your camber setting as lowering the front will add more
negative camber (this is a good thing for autocrossers).
