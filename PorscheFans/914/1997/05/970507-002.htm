Do you mean the roll pin? That's made of hardened steel - get some cobalt 
dril bits. But, you shoudl first try to get it out without drilling 
because the bit will likely drift over to the softer steel of the clutch 
pedal arm and ruin the hole. Try all of the standard methods - torch, 
bigger hammer, nuclear, whatever....use the cobalt bits as the last 
resort. Then you'll need a puller to get the pedal arm off of the shaft 
(pray, man, pray). 

When I did my cluster, I had to toss it and buy a good used one - my old
one had the same problem you're having - rusted-in-place roll pin and
clutch pedal syndrome. I drilld out the roll pin and *still* couldn't get
the clutch pedal off of the shaft. 

Of course, I was so happy to get the good used one apart I went gonzo on 
rebuilding it - got the parts blasted, zinc chromate plated, bronze 
bushings installed, painted it with cold galvinizing compound, then a 
final coat of flat black paint. Looks great sitting on the shelf in my 
garage!
