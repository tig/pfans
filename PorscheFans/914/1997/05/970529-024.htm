I've been in the back ground on this list for some time and have been 
looking for a nice 914 to go with my '73 911T.  Well I think I might have 
found one.  It is '73 914 2.0 and was recommended to me buy a friend and I 
am going to take a look at it tonight.  I am famailiar with most of the 
obvious problems of any 914 but I just wanted to get input at any not so 
obvious things to inspect, look out for etc.  Also what's the approx. going 
rate now days for a '73 914 2.0 that's been owned by the same owner since 
1976, always garaged, everything is suppose to be original (F.I., Fuchs, 
etc.) except for a repaint about 8 years ago.   

Thanks,

Scott

'73 911t (2.7)
