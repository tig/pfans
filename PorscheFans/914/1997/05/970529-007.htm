I was finally able to get my FI points out last night by gently prying
them upward while rocking back and forth and pulling outward.  Boy, what
a pain.  I took everything apart except for what I assume is the
Mechanical Advance mechanism.  I cleaned everything up (it was pretty
dirty) and re-lubed it.  I didn't have a reference distributor, but I
think the mechanical advance stuff is O.K.  There appeared to be two
almost triangular pieces hinged between two plates that rotate above the
FI points.  They had springs on them, and would alternate "falling" as I
rotated the shaft.  They could be gently pried out, and everything
appeared to be moving O.K.  It (and the FI points) were actually quite
clean.  After I got everything put back together, I could suck on the
vacuum advance unit, and cause the upper plate to slide.  So, does it
sounds like my distributor is O.K.?  Is there something else I should
check?  I replaced the rotor and cap (just to be safe), and it'll go
back onto the car this evening.  I really don't think this is going to
do it, but we'll see.  The only other suggestion I can think of is
substantial vacuum leaks, so I'll have to give the carb cleaner test a
try.

Thanks again for all of the help, and if anyone gets any other ideas,
please, let me know!
