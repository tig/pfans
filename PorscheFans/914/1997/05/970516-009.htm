Here's Bob Hoover's "sermon" on painting your engine and cylinders:


Recent comments posted to this list make it clear some subscribers are
not aware of the benefits of painting their engine. The basic reason for
doing
so is preservation. When fitted with a full-flow oil filtration system
the VW flat fours can deliver 150,000 miles or more of service before
the lower end
requires overhaul. Indeed, when fitted with hydraulic cam followers,
stainless steel valves and other modern innovations such as electronic
ignition,
it's not uncommon for a properly assembled engine to deliver 100,000
miles of service without requiring any form of repair.=20

A light coat of flat black paint on the magnesium-alloy crankcase not
only protects it from corrosion, it enhances the heat-flow
characteristics of the
surface. The cast iron cylinders benefit even more, although they are
more difficult to paint. The trick is to get the paint right down into
the bottom of
the fins. To do so calls for the use of a suitable brush, made by
cutting off half the bristles from a small (1/2") paint brush; not an
artists brush, the
regular sort does fine. You must use a brush instead of spray because by
the time you've sprayed enough paint to reach the bottom, you've flooded
the upper part of the fins and made an unholy mess. So start with the
brush, take your time and give your new jugs at least a day to dry
before
handling them.=20

High time engines, especially those operated in cold climates where
corrosive substances are used for snow removal, are often found to have
virtually
no fins at all when the engine is torn down for rebuild. Ions of the
corrosive material, common rock salt in most cases, attach readily to
unprotected
cast iron, and once attached are impossible to remove without boiling
with a 'getter.' This means that once the corrosive ion finds a home on
your cast
iron cylinders, the corrosive action will continue year round, thanks to
water vapor in the air.=20

Rusty or corroded metal makes a fine heat insulator, as every weldor
knows. A few ounces of paint judiciously applied prior to assembling
your engine
is not only the mark of an experienced mechanic, it is one of those
tricks so simple it is often overlooked. But in the long term it means
greater service
life and lower operating costs.=20

And before you succumb to conventional wisdom, drop by any airport and
examine the engines that inspired the original Volkswagen engineers.
Aircraft engines are painted as a matter of course, although such
niceties were ignored with the VW in the interest of economy. The
original idea was
to replace rather than overhaul the engine, and to replace it fairly
often -- typically, at something less than 100,000 km (56,000 miles).
Alas, this
option is no longer practical in todays economic climate.=20
