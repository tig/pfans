Dion,
I recently tackled this problem. I put the unit in a vice with bottom
supported by a piece of wood, soaked the pin in lock-ease, then beat
the heck out of it with a punch and large hammer. But the punch kept
slipping off of the pin. I utlimately succeeded by drilling into the
pin with a carbide tipped bit (which didn't last long) far enough for
the punch to "seat" and then beat the heck out of it some more.
Actually I had a larger person than myself beating on it when it
finally began to move. Not real sophisticated but neither is my garage.

On a side note - replacing that small spring that aids in depressing
the clutch pedal made a real difference. I also thoroughly cleaned
the area under the pedal assembly while I was in there.

Good luck.

Regards,
Alan
