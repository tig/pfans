914ers,

I have a complete F.I. setup off of a 75 2.0l.  It is complete right down
to the distributor (including new points and condensor).  The injectors
were flow tested and matched by a local shop.  The wiring harness is also
included, but only the part which immediately affects the injectors, brain
and throttle body.  I'll even throw in all new vacuum lines.  

I'd like to sell it as a whole unit, but could be pursuaded to part it out
if there is enough interest.  Make me an offer; I don't need the system and
would probably throw it out if it sits in the basement too much longer.
I'm not looking to make a ton of money.  I'd even be open to trades for
other 914 parts.  I am looking for a good front sway bar, if anybody has
one.  Let me know.

Thanks,

Dion
