	First:  Please wrap your lines--many mailers (including mine) don't
deal well with very-very-long lines in our incoming e-mail.

	This is known as a "lean hunt", because it is generally caused by
having not enough fuel for the air your car is getting (a "lean mixture").

	Vacuum leaks are the #1 cause of this in the L-jet (US 1.8L) cars.
A vaccuum leak lets "false air" (air that the FI system doesn't know about)
into the engine.  The FI doesn't know to squirt fuel for that extra air, so
the mixture is too lean.

	Temp Sensor #1 is in the air flow meter.  It has a relatively small
effect on the fuel mixture, and rarely fails.

	The "normal" setting is "whatever sets the idle at the correct RPM."
It is possible that the screw was backed so far out that air was getting in
around it.  That's my only guess as to how that could have changed the idle
hunt.  And it is just a guess.
	Other possible sources for vaccuum leaks include the big rubber hose
from the air flow sensor to the manifold, the "intake runner boots" (the big
hoses from the manifold to the runners), the seal between the runners and
the heads, the fuel injector seals, the oil cap seals (two), the oil breather
box gasket...  That's all I can come up with off the top of my head.  I hope
your problem is gone for good, and you never need a list of possible vaccuum
leak sources!
