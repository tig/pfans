944T, complete with fogs, etc.  Didn't see a side view, but it looked
nice, and there were sufficient vents for oil cooler, cool-air brakes,
or whatever else you might want to fit.>

I saw the same picture - looks really nice [too bad about the Buick
engine ;)]. One of the 914/6s on the cover of EC 2/92 had a similar
944T-style front. The more recent one was done a bit more cleanly to my
eye, but the picture was smaller too. I'd love to hear from someone
who's done the front  and could share how it was done. The GT flares
look awfully vulnerable in parking garage situations. I think I'd prefer
the more subtle flares of the 914/8.
