Not true. Radials will still respond to pressure settings.

Suspension and alignment settings are the best way to adjust
over/understeer. But you still need to balance pressures for the
car/driver combo, so the tires run at their ideal tempearature. If
you're running the wrong pressures on race tires you risk destroying
them in short order or even destroying your car. However, many people do
not have the luxury of a fully adjustable suspension that one can tweak
while in grid at the autox. In cases like this, adjust pressures to
compensate for the handling setup of the car. Sure, equal pressures are
usually a sign of a well balanced car (like mine! :) ) but not everyone
has such a car. VW/neon autocross cars, which are right damn quick
autocrossers, usually setup a 10-15 lb difference in tire pressures from
front to back. The higher front pressure helps control the inherent
understeer, and the lower rear pressure helps create an overtseer. At
the cost of tire wear of course...

Yes, a probe type pyrometer is the best way to determine how your tires
want to run. But not everyone has a pyrometer.
