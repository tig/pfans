Dave,

	The in-line resistor that the factory installed on the '73 cars was 270
ohms. This is the same resistor that is in the "performance tweak"
in-line resistor that is sold by various 914 shops. It helps keep the FI
from leaning out on straightaways. So maybe you want to give that a
try...

Yeah, but ya did! :)
