>-- The speedo just stoped working.  It must be a connection some where
>but I don't know where HELP!!!!
>
>I just finished replacing my speedometer cable, and found it a little easier
>than I thought it would be.  It did, however, require removing my entire
>center console, steering wheel, gauges, and arm rest.  Wait a sec... did I
>say it was easy?  Basically, the speedometer cable runs from the rear of the
>transmission on the passenger side, under the engine, through a tunnel in the
>fire wall, under the arm rest and center console (if so equipped), under the
>dash, and up to the back of the speedometer.  Inspect the cable where it
>attaches to the transmission and make sure it's not loose.  See if the cable
>has frayed or broken anywhere.  There are four screws that hold the
>speedometer (and neighboring gauges) into the dash, and once they're removed,
>you might be able to see the back of the Speedo.  If not, you'll have to pull
>the steering wheel off.  As I recall, the large bolt securing it to the shaft
>is 27mm.  After the wheel is off, you should be able to gently pull the
>gauges forward and inspect the connection at the back of the Speedo.  If it's
>connected there, connected at the tranny, and the cable isn't frayed or
>broken, then chances are something went kaput in the Speedo itself.

>Hope this helps,
