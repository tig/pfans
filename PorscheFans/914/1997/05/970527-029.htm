CLARIFICATIONS

DUE TO THE DELUGE OF RESONSES (35 AND COUNTING), I HAVE RESPONDED TO THE
HIGHEST BIDS IN PERSON.

I have some 914 (916) parts that this newsgroup may be interested in.  I
regret the cars are long gone.  PLEASE RESPOND TO MY EMAIL ADDRESS AS I AM
NOT A MEMBER OF THIS GROUP.

916 Steel flares (complete set) purchased from Vasek Polak Porsche in 1980.
I just never found a car decent enough to put them on. They have been
stored indoors and are  dusty i.e. no rust, dings...  they have pencil
markings in German indicating the corner of the car that they should be
mounted on!  When I bought them, someone told me that there were only 50
sets made??????   BEST OFFER SO FAR IS $900 AND A COUPLE JUST BELOW  I WILL
KEEP THIS OPEN UNTIL JUNE 12 AS I CAN'T SHIP UNTIL THEN ANYWAY.  DOES
ANYONE KNOW IF THE NEW STEEL REPRODUCTIONS ARE THE SAME AS THE ORIGINALS????

Stainless rocker panels new in Box. They still have the peel off protective
skin on them.  THESE ARE BRUSHED STAINLESS WITH JACK CUTOUTS.  THEY ARE THE
FLAT (NON GT) STYLE.

Sway Bar new in box (CAN'T REMEMBER IF FRONT OR BACK OR DIAMETER BUT CAME
FROM PERFORMANCE PRODUCTS IN 1980) WILL UPDATE THIS GROUP WHEN I TAKE
INVENTORY IN JUNE.

If this stuff turns your crank, make an offer... all or part.


THE STUFF IS STORED OFF SITE SO ......I will do a complete inventory in a
couple weeks (WILL POST ON JUNE 12)and can provide additional detail AND
PRICING on the above stuff if there is any interest.   There should be
among other things, a 1.7L engine and transmission that are suitable for
parts.
