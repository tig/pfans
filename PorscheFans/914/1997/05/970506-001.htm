Greetings, 914-er's!

  I seem to recall a thread on the list about how to install the VDO aftermarket electronic oil pressure 
gauge.  I, too ran into the same problem just the other day as I was approaching the critical point in 
assembling the engine and needed to determine how I was going to thread that hose into the engine 
case through that hole in the sheet metal, and get it tight enough not to leak.
    An interesting observation came to light at this point.  The nuts on the supplied piece of hose that 
came with my kit were 9/16" ....  NOT 14 mm!  A little closer observation determined that the thread on 
the end of the hose that's supposed to screw into the engine case is 1/4" NPT, or close enough that 
it makes no difference.  Neither my hose nor the VDO sensor itself would screw into the case as far 
as the original oil pressure switch before getting tight, but neither seemed to damage the threads for 
the original switch either;  I believe the principal difference is in the degree of taper.  For all practical 
purposes, the oil pressure switch hole in my early production '74 2.0 litre is 1/4" NPT.  
    I went up to my FLAPS and bought a 1-1/2' brass nipple in 1/4" NPT and a 1/4" NPT threaded 
coupling with a hex nut molded into it's outside.  I threaded the nipple into the coupling as far as I 
could (using a wrench and vice grips, but no pipe dope or teflon tape) and then flowed solder around 
the threads at the joint.  This makes it oil tight, and ensures that the whole thing always unscrews from 
the engine case, and not the coupling from the nipple.  This assembly is easy to insert through the 
engine tin hole and thread into the case.  The hose that goes with the gauge then screws nicely into 
the other side of the coupling.  It is a bit of a tight squeeze past the distributor cap clip, but it is still 
possible to get the cap on and off.  The whole thing can be accessed with wrenches or sockets from 
above the tin and removed and re-installed easily.
  I hope that this is some help to someone out there.
          
                                                  Regards,
                                                  Jim T.
