I have some 914 (916) parts that this newsgroup may be interested in.  I
regret the cars are long gone.  PLEASE RESPOND TO MY EMAIL ADDRESS AS I AM
NOT A MEMBER OF THIS GROUP.

916 Steel flares (complete set) purchased from Vasek Polak Porsche in 1980.
I just never found a car decent enough to put them on. They have been
stored indoors and are  dusty i.e. no rust, dings...  they have pencil
markings in German indicating the corner of the car that they should be
mounted on!  When I bought them, someone told me that there were only 50
sets made??????

Stainless rocker panels new in Box. They still have the peel off protective
skin on them.

Sway Bar new in box

If this stuff turns your crank, make an offer... all or part.


I will do a complete inventory in a couple weeks and can provide additional
detail on the above stuff if there is any interest.   There should be among
other things, a 1.7L engine and transmission that are suitable for parts.
