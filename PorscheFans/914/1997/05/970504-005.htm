I'm currently rebuilding the 914-6 I recently purchased.  Besides the
installation of a heavier 3.4 ltr motor I want to add more roll cage for the
added safety factor as well as the structural rigidity. I have two questions:

1. Which works best, a welded to the car cage as opposed to a bolt to the
car affair?  I plan to tie in the suspension pickups with the welded bolted
to the car cage structure. I've been told that welding the cage to the car
without the car being put in some kind of jig can "warp" the car. Is there
any truth to this statement?

2. What would be the ultimate track suspension setup?   Struts/springs/sway
bars/bushings/torsion bars/etc.?

Thanks in advance, Michael Hill
