Once upon a time I was thinking of a rotary swap and found
out that those suckers get VERY hot.  They require the cooling
capacity of a small block V8.  In a 914 you'll find the rotary will
consume a large number of mufflers due to the intense heat of
the exhaust.

I'm not sure a radiator in the engine compartment would
work....you'd probably have to go the standard route of 
cutting up the front trunk for the radiator, fans, and plumbing.
I believe you have to cut vent holes in the fenders OR trunk
floor, but not both.  Check into this.

You also have to be careful about the hose routing to avoid
any air pockets which would cause the engine to overheat.

Kennedy Engineered Products has some info about putting
a rotary engine in a 914.  It's a good place to start.  I did a
bunch of checking several years ago and after checking
out the price and the problems with water cooled engines
in a 914, decided to go the 911 engine swap route.  YMMV.
