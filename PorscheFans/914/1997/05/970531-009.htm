it did what some of you guys said and i still can't  get a spark

i measured the voltage from the coil + terminal to the negative battery
ignition on got  12 volts so thats good

i replaced the cap & condensor

i checked to see if there was a spark comming from the coil
put the wire from the coil to the distributor next to the sheetmetal
and it arced so apparentaly everything leading up to and including the coil is 
fine the coilis new by the way

i took the cap off and looked a the points and they opened and closed and 
looked fine

 i did see a spark at the points

i am still kind of suspicious of the rebuilt relay board that i just got

i also tested the breaker plate to the battery withpower on i got a few tenths 
of a volt when i tryed turning it over i got 1 volt

lets put it this way i'm 24 and this car has given me gray hair
i will pay for gas lunch what ever to anybody in the bay area who thinks they 
can fix this car

i cant get it to a shop that does porsches without spending a good 150 bucks to 
towit to the closest shop

i hear the fuel pump working and the fuel injectors firing
did a coductivity test on the spark plug wires and they were good
did a omn test on the rotor and got 4.1 suppost to be betwem 5 and 10
but i did think that this could make that big of a difference

what and where is the grounding braid that Jim T spoke of

as i mentioned before i redid all the harness i can't imagine where there is a 
short or if some thing isn't making contact

i am almost out of juice and despite the fact that this isn't my main form of 
transportation i cant stand it not runing not that any of you care but i am 
dame close to giving it to charity

all of this is so fustrating because before i tool it all the wires FI ETC 
APART it ran i just wanted it to run better am i an idiot or what
