I wish I did! I just contacted http://www.poeton.co.uk/ and aksed them
what they could offer.  IMHO, ceramic coatings are both good and bad; by
using them in the combustion chamber, in theory it would reduce the heat
rejection to the cylinder heads (and engine oil, if the piston crown is
coated) and more energy would be devoted to expansion (pushing the
piston down).  Let's not forget that this added insulation the ceramics
would provide would also make a very difficult environment to support
stable combustion without pre-ignition, not to mention cost of the
coatings and durability would make it a questionable choice for most
people.

However, I think it may be possible to coat the exhaust ports with a
ceramic coating to reduce heat rejection to the head.  Benefits: cooler
head temperatures and higher exhaust gas velocities.  Someday, when I'm
able to build this "Dream Engine" I will also insulate the exhaust
header to keep temps down (heat rises staight up to the engine).  
Anyway, Barrie Poeton forwarded my questions to his technical dept. and
will respond soon; I can let you know what I find out, if you would
like.
