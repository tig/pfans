The stock 914 bias is adjustable, but normally as soon as you touch it 
starts leaking.

Take it out and replace it with a tilton one from Summit or Pegasus at $50 
can't be beat. Then put a VW beetle T in place of the unit in the back, and 
put the new one inside behind the shifter

I assume this was an upgrade to the front brakes only?  Rears would
be a different story, no?  Interested in doing the same thing
myself - especially considering how cheap it is....certainly cheaper
than rebuilding a stock braking system.

It is not adjustable - at least not as far as I know and is buried
against
the firewall in the engine compartment.  You probably have to go
aftermarket
but someone may correct me...
