Jim,

How about a GT bumper and valance?  After all you are trying to get the
same air flow, add a good fan for those times when sitting still, create
a custom trunk duct to exit out your exisitng hole in the floor and a
mount the condensor.  Stock looks more air flow!   And should allow more
room for that larger condensor you are looking for.  You can use a
different fron spoiler and modify it for the air opening.

I have seen a couple of 914 with the 944Turbo nose about, I think it is
made in AZ. some where, buy PowerHaus I thinks, but probally wrong.  Very
updated look, may fit with the theme of modern 914, thou I prefer a
boxster as a modern progression, thou Porsche  does not see it that way.

Take care,
Stephen Jacobs
