If they suck, then they can't have the correct jets "and such." There are 
numerous adjustments on these carbs, and if there are any flat spots, 
surges, etc, then something's wrong. If you bought them new and never 
touched them, then they are more than likely mis-adjusted.

It's true that IDA's don't ahve starting devices, so the addition of a 
hand throttle would appear to be manditory. These are racing carbs, after 
all. If you want to putter, get a Chevy.
