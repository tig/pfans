GUYS GUYS GUYS,

     DON'T put RTV on your intake manifolds. The stupid gaskets are 1 lousy dollar.
     They come in a nice 12 pack from GPR. The gaskets are there for a reason. RTV
     is probably the most abused "tool" on the planet, followed closely by WD-40.
     The RTV squeezes out into a bead inside the manifold, and is then dissolved and 
     ingested, fouling plugs, causing carbon chunks that can hang exhaust valves
     open etc. RTV can be used SPARINGLY to seal case halves, but all too often we
     the stuff put on with a putty knife to "seal" valve covers, pushrod tubes, even
     oil filters, with huge globs squishing out everywhere. Gaskets and O-rings were/
     are used buy the factory for a reason. Look inside a new Porsche engine compartment.
     Do you see any RTV, NOPE! The gaskets are cheap, available, USE EM! OK flame thrower
     off. Just don't get me started on WD-40, hint, NOWHERE on the can does the word
     LUBRICATES appear.
