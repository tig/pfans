Man, I'm getting killed here. . .[ ! >| ]

Jeff, if I wanted to talk end tables I'd sign on for the 911 list. .
..Woah, just kidding 911 guys, my best friend owns an end table heh heh.

As for R1 storage, consensus is:

Store inside in a dark, cool, dry spot.
Stack 'em.
Keep 'em inflated.
Put plastic or cardboard between the tires since they stick together
after a bit.
If they're outside, put them in dark garbage bags to protect from UV,
but don't seal tight because you want condensation to evaporate before
it could damage the finish on your rims.
Keep away from electric motors b/c they produce ozone.

FWIW, Thwen.
