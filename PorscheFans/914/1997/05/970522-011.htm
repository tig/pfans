Thanks for the positive remarks. I know some theory, but I lack as much 
practical experience. (books are cheaper than tools and garages, at least 
around here)

Oops, I made a mistake here. There *is* a type of limited slip
differential that uses planetary spur gears with axes parallel to the
output shafts, as I described, but it isn't the Quaife. 

As I understand the Quaife-type, the worms are parallel to the output
shafts. The Torsen worms are perpendicular. Given that the Quaife worms
are parallel, the extreme helix angle would cause the same style of
limited slip as the spur gear type, ie, the worms are forced against the
case walls to provide a resistance to differentiation. As far as I know,
the one-way power transfer feature of worm gears is not exploited in the
Quaife. 

The Torsen relies on this feature to transfer torque. In detail, each worm
in the Torsen is orienated perpendicular to a worm wheel on the output
shaft.  There are 3 worms per output shaft. The worms are arranged in
pairs, one from one output shaft lies next to another from the other
output shaft.  Thus there are 3 pairs of worms. Each worm has a
straight-cut spur gear at each end. The spur gears of each pair engage
each other and form the sole geared connection between each output shaft. 

In the Quaife, as I understand it, there are 3 pairs of worms arranged
parallel to the output shafts. One worm of each pair engages an opposite
output shaft gear. The worms engage each other and form the geared
connection between the two output shafts. Differential action between the
two output shafts cause the worms to begin turning, and the helix angle of
the worms forces them apart, against the case. There are many patented
variations on this idea, BTW. 

Anyway, the Torsen isn't really a limited slip in the normal sense, since
there isn't a frictional member in the design. As I understand it, it's a
special type of open differential that senses torque and distributes it
accordingly.
