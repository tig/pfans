Semi serious or not, that is exactly how I feel with mine.  The PO had my
2.0+ rebuilt by 'a guy who did race engines'.  I got it with 200 miles on
it.  I got such vague info as it had a 'big bore' kit, a non-stock cam, it
idled rough (has dual Weber 44's ), no idea of compression.

I found no thermostat or flaps, the oil cooler leaks slightly, some kind of
green, non-hardening sealer glopped on the pushrod tube ends and all seams,
oil leaking out of the bottom of bellhousing (probably hammered up the
flywheel seal), the Webers had no block off plates on the missing chokes
and the 009  was timed at about 27deg BTDC statically and advanced from
there.  Blocking off the choke areas and retiming fixed the rough idle.
The cold leakdown test I did had at least 50% on two cylinders, leaking
into the block.  Still have to do a warm leakdown and compression test.

I'm just itching to pull this engine and at least pull apart the top end so
I can look into the block, find out what the actual compression is, etc.
Fighting the 'complete teardown' urges.
