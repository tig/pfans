	WHen  I was at Mid-Ohio  for some SCCA regional or national
race last year or year before (Pretty specific huh?)I stopped
by some 914 in a garage that had a spare engine  sitting out.
I noticed that the fan  on the spare engine had every other n
blade removed.  OTOH, he also had a hugh aluminum duct that started
in the front of the car, ran through where the passenger would
sit and ended up at fan intake. Pretty remarkable.
