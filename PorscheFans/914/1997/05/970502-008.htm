Hey, All right! another carb guy!

Just out of curiosity, what size venturis were you running in these 
carbs? The reason I ask is because the behavior you're describing sounds 
like the venturi on the 46 IDA's was too big, and the one on the 40's was 
a little too small. 

I think many people don't realize just how sophisticated these Webers 
really are, and how much "everything effects everything" from ignition 
timing, to the exhaust system. It's not rocket science or voodoo magic, 
but there is logical reason for everything.
