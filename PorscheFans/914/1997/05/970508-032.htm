	In general, putting more sway-bar on one end of the car makes
that end slide more.  (Or makes the other end slide less, take your
pick.)  Conversely, putting less sway-bar on one end of the car makes
that end slide less.  So unhooking the rear bar may not do what you
think it will.
	Everybody pushes in slow (tight) 180s--that's just a function of
that type of turn.  The slower/tighter the turn, the less well the front
wheels will grip.  This is especially so under acceleration.  You just
have to change your driving style to deal with it, or live with it.  You
may be able to dial out the understeer, but at that point the car will
be rather tail-happy.  Even if you aren't sideways through every corner,
you will still be scrubbing off speed and not going quite as fast as you
could be with a more neutral car.
	Most people choose to stiffen up the roll resistance of the front
end of the car by putting in a larger-than-stock sway bar.  Most people
tend to stiffen up the rear end's roll resistance by putting on heavier-
than-stock springs.  The main reason that the rear bar is not used is the
wheel-lift problem noted by Andrew.  There is also the potential problem
of bottoming out the travel on the bar, which tends to change the "stick"
at the back end unpredictably.
	I got a wide variety of opinions when I asked if I should get rid
of my stock rear bar.  The consensus was that I should if I were running
sticky tires or any upgraded suspension, and maybe if I was running hard-
compound street tires (which I do).
	The absolute best advice I got was, "Try it each way, and see
which one you like best."  I did, and I kept the bar.   I may try removing
it again now that I have working shock absorbers...
