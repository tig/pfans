Don't know the answer here.  I know that FAT performance makes some
pretty
tricked-out fan conversions for type IVs though.

I'm confused about this one as the alternator belt is driven by the 
impeller itself.  If it were removed, there would be nothing left
to drive the alternator.  I think the alternator would drain more
power from the engine than the impeller all by itself since the "load"
of the impeller is just the cost of moving air...
