	Dirk, Dirk, Dirk...  By 83 the 911 had a catalytic converter, and
no thermal reactors.  I think the CA 75-6 folks were the only ones who had
to suffer those monstrosities (also some or all 912E owners).
	The G-50 transmission was introduced in 87.  All 911s from 72-87
used the 915 box, but we've heard stories about putting the 915 in a 914,
haven't we?  The 901 should be fine if you baby first gear.

	I dunno...  If you look at how the factory did the original Sixes,
they did just about the minimum changes they could.  The interiors are very
similar between fours and sixes, and the main exterior change was the five-
bolt wheels.  If you use that as an example, then you would keep most of the
car the same.
	That method is also a bit friendlier to the budget than making lots
of changes to the car--which fits right in with the original Sixes.  Suppo-
sedly Porsche was pretty hard-pressed to keep the /6 under the 911 T's price
range, so they didn't go overboard with "Six-only" features.

	Whatever the design choices, sounds like a fun project!
