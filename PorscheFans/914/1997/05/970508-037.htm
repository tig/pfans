Hi Audiophile's:

I've been a car-fi guy for quite some time now.  Stereo systems can be a
lot of fun.  I'm also one of the first people to admit that the 914 is too
loud for a truly excellent stereo system.  If you are *really* into car-fi,
then you want a quieter car.  


That being said, I've recently discovered a large hunk of foam in the
passenger footwell, under the carpet.  The (calcuated) volume of the foam
is 0.5 cu ft.  If one builts a fibreglass enclosure to fit this space, and
extends the enclosure out somewhat (3" or so), you can get a 1.0 cu ft
enclosure.

Put your 10" sub in that box, and aim the speaker at the passenger's knees.
 Be sure you make a *very sturdy* grille structure.

My sub box is "in progress" right now.  It's really a spare-time project. 
When it's done, I expect good results.  Plus, it will be removeable (for
autoX events), and completely hidden from prying eyes.

As with all stereo systems, be prudent about where you "crank it up" and
you don't really have to worry about theft.

Hope this gives the stereo guys something to think about.  

cheers,

Brian
