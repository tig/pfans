I sent this message a few days ago, but I haven't received any replies
and I'm not sure it ever made it to the list.  So, if you've already
received this, I apologize.

A friend of mine purchased a '76 914 2.0 that had been sitting for at


least four years.  We were able to start it, but it ran like crap and
the compression readings were all below 70 psi.  He's began a top-end
rebuild, and discovered that the pistons in the car are .020in overbore.
 The cylinders are so rusted that at least another .010 is going to need
to be removed.  So, he's got a few options that I thought I'd run by the
list:

1.  Scrap what he's got and get a new set of pistons and cylinders
2.  Find (if possible) .030 overbore pistons and .030 overbore rings
3.  Find a set of good cylinders and overbore them .020, and find some
..020 overbore rings

At this point, he doesn't care about tweaking the car for additional
performance, and his financial situation is limiting his expenditures.
Obviously, even if .030 overbore pistons and rings are cheaper than a
new stock set, if they're not going to last more than 10,000 miles,
he'll go with the new set.  Are we missing any options?  Which one looks
like the best?

Thanks,
