  As an old geezer who was playing around with sports cars in the 60's, I remember when bias-ply 
tires were common, and radial-ply tires were exotic.  One of the common things one experienced at 
that time was people comming up to you and helpfully pointing out that your tires were low, or even 
"flat" because of the squat, bulgy look of radials compared to bias-ply tires.  It was my 
understanding that the reason for this, as well as the superior handling of radials, was because 
radial-ply tires had much more limber and compliant sidewalls than bias-ply tires, thus allowing the 
tire contact patch to remain the same size, even when the tire assumed some funny positions due to 
suspension geometry, body roll, or whatever.
  It was the bias-ply tires, with the stiff sidewalls, that tended to corner like steel-tired wagon wheels, 
reducing the footprint when the wheel axis deviated from perfect parallel with the road surface.

  Incidentally, I go through tires pretty fast, as I commute mountain roads, and I find that tire pressure 
has a pronounced effect on tread wear.  I run brand X radials on my truck, although I have run 
Michelins in the past, and I find that if I don't reduce the pressure on the rear tires, to compensate for 
the empty bed, that they will wear out in the center first.  Conversely, when I wear the outsides off the 
fronts through hard cornering, rotating them to the rear and inflating to max pressure will make them 
look as though they were wearing evenly.  Helps when you are constantly turning in bald tires under 
a  60,000 mile wear-out warranty with only 20,000 miles on them!

                                                  Regards,
                                                  Jim T.
