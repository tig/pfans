When leaving George's after picking up my car I had a new electrical glitch
show up.  Haven't driven it much at night yet.  I had the headlights on and
as I backed out of his driveway and headed down the street the alternator
light came on.  I checked the belt then walked back to George's. He hadn't
noticed anything when he had test driven it.  My console volt gauge was
showing less than 8 volts. Car started fine so George got out meter and
checked battery while running.  13.8 volts, 13.2 with headlights.  Figured
it may be a bad connection and not the alternator/regulator since the volt
gauge was also low.

I lived dangerously and headed out for the 80 mile drive back to Pasadena.
Made it fine.  I had a chance to check briefly this morning and the battery
still showed 12.65 without car running so didn't discharge.  I noticed that
the emergency brake light wasn't on either when turned key on.  Checked and
the #9 fuse was fried.  Checked manual and this is where I'm trying to
figure it out.

I assume I got another wiring short somewhere but the symtoms are weird so
hopefully this will sound familiar and someone can help narrow it down.

#9 fuse in manuel says  'Stop, turn, and backup'   didn't get to see if I
had stop or backup lights.  I already have another unresolved glitch where
the left turn signals had worked but not the right side.  Last night I
looked and I had the parking lights on right side but not left.

The turn signal to left didn't work last night, just made the gen light dim
a bit.

May have lost the power to the center console. I have the oil temp gauge,
when first left George's I though it wouldn't work since the needle didn't
jump to the left side mark with the key on.  It did start climbing as I
drove though.
I have a CHT gauge but that gets signal from the sensor, only power is for
the dash lights (which don't work right now).  And the non reading volt
gauge.

Looks like I'll be spending some time with the digital voltmeter this
weekend.

Is there anything else hooked to #9 fuse,  looking at the wiring diagram in
Haynes for the USA 73 it looks like it might also have the horn and
ventilator motor.

Anyone ever found a better wiring diagram for the 73 than in the Haynes
manuel, maybe in color?
