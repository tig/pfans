Bring them inside somewhere. At the very least, somewhere relatively
dry.

If the tires are going to be outside or subject to UV or weather, keep
them in dark plastic trash bags. But you don't want it compleatly
sealed, too much collected moisture can also be bad. When I kept them in
my carport, I had them lifesaver style and it left some little glossy
flat spots on the rubber. So I keep them stacked now. Keep some plastic
between them or you'll find they glue themselves to each other. And keep
air in 'em.
