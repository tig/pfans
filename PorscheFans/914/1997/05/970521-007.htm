Hi all you Timothy Leary fans.

I am looking for some LSD!

The original LSD that is, a Limited Slip Differential, not the drug. 
Anyway I was wondering what current market price was for one of these
things used?  I know the cost of a new one, I just want to make sure I am
not getting taken for a ride on a used one.

Now if I could just find a pusher (parts dealer) down the street that has
a 901 LSD at the right price.  Really I have found one, but just want to
know current market value.

If you have one for sale drop me a note also, you never know.  Anyway I
know of a couple others that are looking to pickup a one also, I can
forward the info onto them.

Q: So.... You don't drink, don't smoke, what do I do?  

A: 914s an addictive drug all to themselves.

Take care,
Stephen Jacobs
