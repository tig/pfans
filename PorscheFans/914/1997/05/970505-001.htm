  Josh:  is it possible that the old pump just wasn't delivering enough pressure to show up existing 
problems around the fuel rails?  In that case, it wouldn't be their fault.  It is also possible that they 
dislodged some dirt into the system which lodged in the fuel pressure regulator, changing it's 
regulation point.
  In any event, I'd check that fuel pressure, and see if it's out of line.   An adjustment to the regulator 
might solve all your problems.

                                                  Good Luck,
                                                  Jim T.
