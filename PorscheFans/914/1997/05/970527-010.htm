Do take into account you interest and desire in autox and other
competition events. How interested are you in competing? Are you
thinking of someday winning a trophy that you can put on your desk to
make your co-workers envious? Then read the rules. Few clubs if any will
allow you to change the cam and remain in a "stock" class. Chances are
you'll wind up against the trailer-riding-fire-breathing-monsters. That
point aside, I've heard some bad things about the hydrulic set ups. Like
if anybody (mechaninc) tries to adjust your valves as if it were a
regular set up, they're toast. But that's just what I've been told. I
compete in two club series and neither of them allow cam changes.
