It might have had the thermal reactors that I think this vintage of 911 
had. You don't want those, by the way. It would have the next generation 
transaxle (G50?), concurrent with the 911.

I'm sure the bumpers would be better intgrated, as in the contemporary 
911. The interior might have had some of the wild "op-art" patterns from 
the early 924's and 928's. Wheels would have been Fuchs. Also, some kind 
of fender flare would have been used, something better integrated than 
the "add-on" type usually seen on 914s. There would be much less chrome 
trim. Air conditioning would have been better integrated, too. Nicer 
steering wheel, too.
