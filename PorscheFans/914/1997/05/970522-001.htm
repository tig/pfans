Mike,

What's up with this recurring coffee table tire storage idea? I picture
500+ 914 P-fan households with wheels for tables, beds, chairs,
footstools, etc.  You all must be saving a fortune in furniture. 
Perhaps ArtVan could be persuaded to make a look-a-like kit?  You too
can have the P-fan look in your house; forget that Shaker armoir, we'll
make you one out of Fuchs, R1s, and tinted glass. . . 

Incidentally, there's an outfit in England somewhere that's making boots
with soles of used F1 rubber.  You can pick from wet or slick
compounds.  I'd like mine made from Michael's Monaco wets, please.

Thwen.
