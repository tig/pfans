I would hazzard a guess and say your leaks were due to the neoprene
gaskets and not the OEM covers. I've had one leak occur with the OEM
cover and cork. And that was due to teh gasket getting sucked inward by
engine vacuum.

If the amount of silicone is small and there is no damage to the sealing
surface of the cork, why couldn't you reuse it? You reuse it with the
aluminum covers, waht's the diff?
