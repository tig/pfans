      I own a 1971 914 that is all original -- 1.7 FI and it actually runs
preety fair .  I have the opportunity to purchase a 1967 911 REALLY cheap.
I would like to swap out most of the components--
suspension ,brakes , and engine . I have had several people tell me most of
these parts will easily 
interchange. I'd like to know how true this is -- CAN I swap out steering
racks, suspension A-arms and 
brakes ???  I've done a little reading on the engine swap from four to six
and it seems like no troble at all .
 This car (the 911)  is in excellent mechanical shape but rusted in half. it
has been inside for about 12
years.  What cc engine would be in this 1967 model ??  What horsepower rating ??
   There seems to be a TON of knowledge between the members of this group
and I would appreciate all the 
 input I can get ----
