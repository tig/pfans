   Hey Josh...  You're the guy with the physics degree, so correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't it take X 
amount of horsepower to move Y amount of air?  And... if you do it with an electric fan instead of a 
mechanical fan, aren't you just going to expend the same amount of energy, plus conversion losses 
from mechanical energy to electrical energy and back again?
   The only place that I can see that you might gain something is if you ran the fan off the battery for 
the duration of your autoX run, or if efficiencies can be gained with a constant-speed fan instead of a 
variable speed one.  The problem with the latter idea, though, is that heat loads go up with revs, so 
the fan has to move more air also.
  Anyway, I can't figure out the advantage, and would appreciate your astute analysis, and I bet the 
rest of the list would too.

                                                  Thanks,
                                                  Jim T.
