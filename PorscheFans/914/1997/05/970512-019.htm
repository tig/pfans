Okay my list would be this:

Get the 3.2 it will make gobs of torque and nice HP.  You will like it
allot, I have never been a big fan of the 3.0L engines.  But I do like
2.0-2.4 for different reasons, but then that is just me.

Back in P-philes days I listed cars and there performance capabilities
along with weights interesting but since then I have found a bench racing
program.

And here is what it came up with:

Used the following specifications for all 914s:

Well that is the run down, the program is called Car Test - Car
Acceleration Simulation Version 3.0 1992-94 Patrick Glenn

Also note: these are simulations, your natural car may vary quite a bit. 
I think the program is close, but then you never know.  But does make for
good reading.

Take care,
