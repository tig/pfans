JJ,
 The VW guys use an inexpensive piston ring compressor that goes to 94mm.
If you pick up an issue of Hot VW's or VW Trends you will see them
advertised everywhere. I think it's about $3.00 and you use vise grips to
clamp it. The thing works well for one engine but the tabs get bent
easily and for the price you can just throw it away and pick up another
one for the next engine you do. As far as "whacking" the pistons, I don't
think that's the "proper" procedure! After oiling the rings liberally,
simply slide the  jugs over the pistons. If you can't slide them easily
you have got the compressor too tight..........
