Greetings, 914-er's!

  The idle contact is between terminals 17 and 47 on the TPS.   If you have a breakout box, this is 
terminals 17 and 11 on the ECU connector.  The correct technique is to adjust for contacts just 
closing as the throttle butterfly is returned to it's closed position.  There is a travel direction sensor 
switch that detects whether the throttle is moving in the opening or closing direction, and this switch is 
in series with the idle detection contacts, so that any movement of the throttle toward opening should 
defeat the idle detection contacts regardless of throttle switch position adjustment.  However, to 
prevent premature activation of the "idle" mode on throttle closure, the adjustment should be made.
  In actual practice, the points at which the switch itself forms a mechanical stop and the point where 
the idle detection contacts close are very close together, so that all that is really necessary is to 
verify that there is a reliable 0 ohms between 17 and 47 on throttle closure, and that this does not 
appear very much before full seating of the butterfly valve in the closing direction.
  The easiest procedure seems to be to rotate the switch with the throttle closed until 0 ohms is 
observed, lock it down at that point, and then verify correct adjustment by ensuring that 0 ohms 
always appears just before the throttle fully closes.  If the 0 ohms reading is not reliable, tweak the 
switch position a bit and test again.

  Hope this helps.
                                                  Regards,
                                                  Jim T.
