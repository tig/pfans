11. Stock fan capacity is 800 liters per second @4600rpm (per techspec 
booklet) which translates to 1695 cubic feet per minute.  The electric fan is 
rated at 1250 cubic feet per minute (engine rpm independent).  IF there's a 
linear correlation between the stock fan's output and engine rpm, the electric 
fan puts out the same airflow as the stock fan does at 3392rpm (above that, 
the electric puts out less than the stock fan; below that, the electric puts 
out more than the stock fan).  Also, the stock fan's output would climb to 
2210 cubic feet per minute @6000rpm, almost double (1.768 times) what the 
electric fan is capable of.  What's the impact of all this on engine temp?  
Any conditions under which it could overheat?  Or fail to allow the engine to 
reach operating temperature?

12. The electric fan system shroud does not extend outward to the chassis, so 
the engine compartment is not sealed (top from bottom).  As a result, 
exhaust-heated air will rise and become intake air for the carbs and the 
cooling fan.  While probably not important once moving, I've been warned that 
this can cause the car to overheat in street traffic (my current engine tin 
also only covers the cylinders - no front or rear pieces, and the sides of the 
left and right pieces are cut off where they would extend to the sides of the 
engine compartment, so it's essentially the same as the electric fan shroud).

13. Since the stock oil cooler must be replaced with an external one, it would 
be nice if an adapter, cooler, lines, etc., could be offered in the package as 
an optional extra ($ less than if ordered elsewhere separately).  I realize 
the primary market is those who are already racing and therefore those who 
probably already have an external cooler, but even those folks may need a 
stock cooler block off plate or something (don't most folks leave the stock 
cooler on when installing an external one?).

14. An offer to disclose names and phones of satisfied customers to potential 
buyers adds credibility to products such as this.  The system may be too new 
to have many users, but I'm surely not the only potential buyer to want 
someone else to "test the water" first.
