.. . . Hopefully your state will adopt the 25 yr exemption program and you may
only need to do it one more time. . . . 
Okay by me!

.. . . as soon as I get those
vintage plates, . . . 
Our state has a 30-year minimum, so I'm due in 2001.

the D-jet FI is history. Most likely replaced by a
programable DFI like Haltec, or Electromotive or something. Plumb in an
O2 sensor and get a car with a bit more power, alot more manageability,
and potentially cleaner than the stock FI would allow.
Have you read/heard about CB Performance's FI?  $1500 for the manually 
(cockpit) adjustable one, $2000 for the computer controlled (closed loop) one. 
 Either one with your choice of 40 or 48 throttle bodies (look like a Weber 
with a fuel rail).  Plus your current 2.0 intake runners and air cleaners fit. 
 If I ever build a 2.5 . . . 
 

.. . . So, how do you think you'll fare against Karen and her little Lotus?
Just had to bring me down, eh?  The only days I can even hope to take that 
class are the days they're out of town.

That's some serious competition up there. Looking forward to hearing
about it. When's your next event?
BIG weekend:
Saturday - PCA
Sunday - SCCA
Monday - Bremerton SCC
I'll try to hit the first two at least.  Rain is predicted for Saturday, so I 
guess I'll need to put the Lexan side windows back in, at least to get there.

Mike
