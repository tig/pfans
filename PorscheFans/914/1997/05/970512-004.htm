I would skip the no name, but 'specially for a 914' type speakers. =
Making or finding an adapter and putting in speakers you know are a good =
brand is a far better choice.=20

Just make sure the speakers are not too deep -- there is not a lot of =
space behind the stock grilles. Get a Crutchfield catalog. They have =
great technical info on the dimension limits for mounting speakers in =
virtually any car. I think they also sell lots of adapter plates.

I put a set of MB Quart 4" rounds in and they work great. To do this, I =
used a set of homemade plywood adapter plates left by a previous owner. =
I also used black sheet foam from a craft store as a front for the wood =
-- looks nice through the grille.=20

The biggest limitation to the stock 914 speaker mounts is that they are =
fairly thin rigid plastic -- so are prone to vibration problems if given =
much bass. By chance, I ran into a MB Quart product manager on the 'Net =
who is a former 914 owner. He suggested reinforcing the backs of the =
plastic frames with bondo. I have not had the chance to do it yet, but =
it makes a lot of sense.

Subject: 	Speakers in a 914

Hello all,

 I am to the point of putting the sound system back in my 914 and have a
question. What size speaker can I put in the factory speaker grills? My
car had speakers in the door panels but now I have new panels to =
install.
What is the solution? I have noticed that Automotion advertises some =
sort
of adapter plate with round speakers in it. Are these any good? Has
anyone ever made their own setup like this? I am not an audiophile but I
do have a nice CD unit to install. Any feedback would be helpfull!

Thanks,
Bill =20
