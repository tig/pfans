Anyone using or ever used 4 lug to 5 lug adapter plates.  I have these from
the PO.  I'm switching to true 5 lug and will need to remove the adapters.
The adapters are held to the rotor by the 4 original lug bolts. All the
bolts are recessed into holes. A regular 19mm socket (at least the
Craftsman 12pt one I have) won't fit into the recess.  Also one of the 4
lug bolts has the stud for the 5 lug pattern spot welded to the head of it.

Did these things come with some kind of special socket or tool to install
or uninstall?  I could get another socket and have it turned down slightly
to just fit in the recess I suppose but the one with the stud welded on
would need a Very deep socket.

Thanks,
Jeff
