Considering that a new Quaife lists for $1595, anything less than $1000 would 
turn heads assuming it works.

P.S.:  "As long as you're in there," would you be changing any gear ratios?  
If so, from what to what, and why?

Subject: 	Cost of used LSD?

Hi all you Timothy Leary fans.

I am looking for some LSD!

The original LSD that is, a Limited Slip Differential, not the drug. 
Anyway I was wondering what current market price was for one of these
things used?  I know the cost of a new one, I just want to make sure I am
not getting taken for a ride on a used one.

Now if I could just find a pusher (parts dealer) down the street that has
a 901 LSD at the right price.  Really I have found one, but just want to
know current market value.

If you have one for sale drop me a note also, you never know.  Anyway I
know of a couple others that are looking to pickup a one also, I can
forward the info onto them.

Q: So.... You don't drink, don't smoke, what do I do?  

A: 914s an addictive drug all to themselves.

Take care,
Stephen Jacobs
