I called Paul Spruell (800-552-2532), and the widest they had for the 
four bolt pattern was 15x6. Street Panasports are 156$ each. Of course, 
in the five bolt pattern the sky is the limit in terms of width.

Yeah, that's the one I was thinking of. They make a minilite look alike 
for low money. I'm surprised they are 19# each, they claim they are very 
light weight. I'll have to weigh my ATS wheels, they feel very light, of 
course they are only 5.5" wide, so it's not a fair comparason.
