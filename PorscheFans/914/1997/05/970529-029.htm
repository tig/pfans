Several people have been discussing issues concerning the ACC "Electric Fan
Shroud".  For those interrested in definitive answers concerning this setup
I'ld have to encourage you to call Don Ramsey at ACC (423-671-4914) for those
details. I have discussed my application with him several times and he seems
willing to provide information not detailed in his color flyer.
I have some ideas and information on the comments so I'll address them after
each of the questions/comments.  Here goes.......  

Michael Nugent and Jashua Hadler passed on the following:

I received a color flyer in USnailmail today; these are my 
observations/questions:
>1. It apparently comes without spark plug holes cut (so it will fit 2.0 or 
other heads); something for the buyer to do, I guess, but locations should be

noted in the instructions (are they?).<
- RJ - The spark plug holes are not cut.  One reason is the obvious
application flexability for this shroud to fit either the 1.7L/1.8L or 2.0L
type four engines which have different plug hole locations.  Its also common
to have "competition" plug wire sets that have non-standard air seal sizes.
 No instructions are currently available.  Don is very willing to try to help
anyone via the telephone as to what tools and fitting tips may be necessary
to complete the installation.  He welcomes any questions on the shrouds
design intent and will be happy to pass on his experience with its use.     
>Similarly, I would expect the fiberglass to be thicker than sheet metal, so
stock spark plug air seals probably won't fit (at least without cutting each
seal's groove wider).<
- RJ - I don't see the glass thickness as a problem as the air seals just
press up to the sheet metal and don't really have a groove to clamp to the OE
sheet metal.
For reference: The glass is 1/8th inch thick over most of the shroud and
thickens to almost 1/4 inch in areas requiring additional strength.  The
glass is hand layed matt.
>2. No mention of attachment method; it does not appear to use the standard 
sheet metal screw locations.<
- RJ - The shroud attaches via the OE screw points on each side of the intake
manifolds.  Suggestions of using a large washer to distribute the clamping
force of these screws makes good sense.
>3. I think I heard on the list the stock oil cooler must be removed, but 
there's no mention of that requirement in the flyer.<
- RJ - A common method for improving oiling on the type IV engines involves
adding an accusump to the engines oil system.  As the 914 in race trim can
generate 1G plus cornering forces the OE windage tray, even with sumps, often
proves inadequate.  Especially on courses with long sweepers.  The addition
of this pressurized oil accusump often requires connection to the OE oil
coolers stock engine case location.  This means that many of the originally
targeted cars (full race E Production and GT3 914s) would have a relocated
cooler anyway.
I know for a fact that many of this lists members are very savy fabricators.
 For all of the 6er owners and 911 owners the solution Porsche used to get
air to the cooler six cylinder engine should be familiar and work here also.
 A fairly simple addition to the electric shroud should similarily be a
do-able deal.   
>4. It has no intake screen; I think it should to keep stuff too big from
going 
through the fins from getting into the fan area (e.g., leaves when parked in 
the pits with the lid up, a dropped wrench while adjusting timing, not to 
mention one's fingers).  A 1/8" grid screen would be easy to fabricate, 
however.<
- RJ - Good idea, especially on a street car!
>5. Still no mention of an alternator bracket.  At the least, buyers would
want 
to know where to get one (recommended supplier) or would want a blueprint
they 
could take to their local machine shop for fabrication - not an unreasonable 
expectation to me of a $500 item manufacturer.<
- RJ - I hate to beat the "original design" excuse to death but I think
that's why the alternator hasn't been a concern.  Most 914 racers run on DC
battery power and recharge in between races.  Some thoughts of using the
VW/Upright fan shroud mount have been kicked around at our local skunk-werks
specialty shop (H&H Enterprises).  It looks to be an adaptable modification.
 Don has also mentioned an autocrossing customer that uses a modified AC
mount and the AC pulley to accomadate the alternator addition.
>6. No mention of possible downsides or applications to be avoided.  For 
example, it's obvious it can't be used with stock FI, but does its racing 
function imply it shouldn't be used on the street for some reason?
- RJ - I don't think there is a complete enough data base to support it's
viability for street use or its exclusion as an option on a street car.  
>Is there such a thing as too much cooling air going over the engine?<
- RJ - There definately is a concern about over-cooling.  Especially for
someone concerned with producing maximum HP.  I am certainly not an engineer
but do understand that the engine heads were designed to flow best when
operating temperatures were reached.   
>What about using it in the rain - any problem there?<
- RJ - Not todate.  The racers that have used it (some with full "GT" style
grills) haven't suffered failure or reduced cooling fan performance when wet.
 
>7. My current accelerator cable bracket would mount inside the fan housing,
so 
obviously a higher bracket would be required.  Again, as in #5 above, where
do 
they recommend you get one that will work with their product, or how should 
one be made?<
- RJ - I suspect fabrication is the answere here.  As most racers deal with
some level of fabrication prior to, or during races.  This piece is minor and
I suspect Don has left this opportunity/solution to the engine builder.  
>8. They show a degree wheel where the impeller was; again, there's an 
opportunity for them to offer an optional extra ($) or make a recommendation.
 
(My first impression was that the wheel made sense; my second impression was 
that if your hand ever came too close, you'd look like a retired
Slice-O-Matic 
salesman in about one bloody second!)<
- RJ - The degree wheel shown is included with the kit.  I don't know that
building a shroud for this degree wheel was a high priority as it was
certainly determined to be unnecessary for a racer.  On a combination car or
on a dedicated autocrosser (where weight and extreme safety precautions are
not major considerations) an aluminum or steel shield could be made and
mounted to the OE impeller fan shrouds four vacant studs.  
>9. On the secondary gains side, it would sure be a lot easier to change
(late 
model) inner engine mounts with that impeller casing out of the way.<
- RJ - I agree and would add that the front oil seal and oil galley plugs
were surely be easier to access.  In car service to this area would be
greatly improved. 
Crank fire ignition installations would also be much easier.  The mounting of
a pickup asssembly would be much cleaner with all of the original impeller
housing eliminated.  
>10. They claim "%HP" gains, but aren't clear how much is due to the fan 
change, and how much is due to the removal of the alternator.<
- RJ - The alternator is good for a draw of 3 to 5 HP depending on charging
state (load or no load).
>All in all, it's intriguing and it looks like there could be enough profit
margin to allow the product to be produced over an extended period of time.
 I'd value answers/feedback on my observations/questions.<
- RJ - I'm not sure of the financial profitability and its production life
span but my plans are to buy this kit in about a month.  Funds and progress
on the repair of Ole Yeller allowing, I'll be sending 500.00 to ACC for the
kit.  Shortly after that I'll be able to pass on first hand experience with
the kit.

I look forward to more discussion................
