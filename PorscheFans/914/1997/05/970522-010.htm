A salisbury-type is the clutch pack connected to the bevel gears. The
nice thing about the salisbury-type is that it's easier to adjust the
amount of lockup you get by adjusting the ramp angles. But that is a
more recent development of that type and the old posi-trac diffs that
never had that luxury.

the salisbury diff I read as being described as such: The diff is
reactive, and will exert a force on the outer wheel to try and bring it
up to the speed of the spinning inner wheel. It does this through the
clutch pack and the amount of lockup is determined by the ramp angle
setup.

[snip] great description of Troque Sensing diff here.

From what I understand the Quaife is a Torsen type differential. That
there are subtle differences between the Gleason-Torsen differential
(now not very common), and the now popular Quaife, but the two are
virually identical.  The guts of a Quaife I looked at have six sets of
intermeshed planetary worm gears which are driven by the sun gears on
either side of the diff. The amount of lockup can be set by preloading
the worm gears as well as changing the helix angle of the worm gear. But
the basic function is as you said. The really nice thing about the
Torsen diffs is that is transfers torque to the more heavilly loaded
wheel PRIOR to wheelspin, rather that having to relay on the clutch type
to spin up and lock before regaining power.

Problem is, you tend to get a power-on oversteer with a torsen type and
if the inside wheel comes off the ground, you don't get any power. At
least that's my understanding...

You bet.
