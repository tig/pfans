By the way, I neglected to mention this before but the Torsen and the
Salisbury type LDSs will not yield the same results. The Salisbury is a
true limited slip and will allow power to be applied even with one rear
wheel off the ground (depending on the set up). Not so with the Quaife,
the Quaife can't handle any more than a 10% reduction in load on a
wheel. If the wheel lifts off the ground, i.e. 100%, it's effectiveness
is nullified and it's just an expensive open diff. So take note all
those who are concerned with the rear wheel lift problem on very stiff
914s. If you really do want to attack it with a LSD, the quaife may not
be the best approach.

Yes, a Torsen can be set up to allow more load reduction, but it's not
simple and for most of us poor slobs, way too expensive. It involves
replacing the worm gears in the diff, different helix angles and edges
etc... Not for the faint of heart. And all this awsome info in one
issue. It's the best description of limited slips that I've yet to read.
