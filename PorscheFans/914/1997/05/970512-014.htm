Good point about the FI trigger.  Couple of other things that may or may
not apply since I'm more familiar with the type 1 engine.

When I built the 1776 for my Thing, Gene Berg recommended 20 weight oil for
the break-in since everything is new and tolerances are tight.   40 weight
oil seems kind of thick to me for regular use of a non-worn out engine let
alone a break-in.

Since I took a long time to build the engine, when I was going to crank it
over for oil pressure the first time I hand lubed the rockers, etc. then
installed the covers.  I pulled out the spark plugs so the engine wasn't
fighting the compression, coil wire off, etc.  Then turned it over until
had oil pressure.

Now put plugs back and start it.  I did the 20 minutes at 2K RPM based on
Berg's instructions for the cam. Then the varied speed, oil change, etc.
like others have mentioned.

There is only one small thing I'd like to add here, and that is
disconnect the FI triggers as well before cranking for a minute. That
way you don't have alot of excess unburnt fuel pumped into the engine
before starting. You can do this either at the distributor, or at the
injectors.
