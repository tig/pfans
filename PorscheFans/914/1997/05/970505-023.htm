This is starting to sound like a dc Auto love fest...
My dealings with Robert found him a bit optimistic 
about the condition of the 7 & 9 inch fuchs I bought
from him.  Not that it was a bad deal -- their condition
matched his price.  They just weren't "perfect" as he
described on the phone.

FWIW, I'd probably buy from him again.
