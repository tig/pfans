Thank you. Finally someone else had an intermittent fuel pump problem. I
was getting way to many comments that it really was the power delivery
circuit and not the pump. I was feeling good that the circuit passed and
that the pump was going south. Well, the jury's still out on that one.


I'll hopefully let y'all know this afternoon.

I'd like to. Hopefully on sunday morning, burnin' gas and scrubbin'
tires. Got my fingers crossed...
