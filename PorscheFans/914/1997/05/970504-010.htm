I`ve been reading the Forum for a while and have been impressed with the
help offered, now I could use a little advice. I have a `74 2.0 with most
options except air, the car is in very good condition. The floorpans and
longitudinals are in vg to excellent condition, the exception being on the
right side just past the end of the longitudinal. The frame has rusted
around the jack plate and rearward to where the frame curves upward. The
rusted area is about 1/2" from the frame seam and extends about 3" up the
frame. Questions: is this common? , and what is the preferred method of
repair?
Also, I just purchased a `72 1.8 for parts, it has a 2.2 big bore kit with
2 downdraft Webbers. Questions: does anyone out there have any info on the
2.2 big bore kit(the upgrade was done circa `85 - `86) and will this engine
bold up to my `74 side shifter. Are there any potential problems installing
the 2.2 in my `74? Plans are to blueprint the original 2.0 F.I. engine and
reinstall it after I have worn out the 2.2.

                              Thank You
                                              M.A.Selkirk
