How about incorporating a small solid bar accross the top of the net, a
small steel rod would be sufficient. And affix it to the top of the A
pillar and the roll bar. Shouldn't be too hard I guess.

Why did they want you to do that? My understanding is that you need a
diagonal brace to prevent the B pillar (914 roll bar) from collapsing
sideways in the event of a roll over. If it's to prevent the window from
being popped into the drivers area, then do what i did. I bought some
rubber spring spacer blocks at my FLAPS and sandwiched them between my
harness bar and the window. No more leaks and no more ratling and I
didn't have to mess around with the icky goey window seal stuff.

Mike, How'd your weekends events go? I got whooped in CSP. Missed DFL
fortunately, but I was pretty far back. I need more tire and more
driver.
