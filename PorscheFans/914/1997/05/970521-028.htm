I don't know who originally posted the message re: idle speed slowdown in
their 73 2.0 in a traffic jam, but I had a similar problem with my 75 1.8FI (L-jet) and the culprit was the decel valve. Lotsa 914 have had theirs
removed I've noticed. The decel valve allows the idle to gradually return
from high revs, and if it isn't working right and your idle is not set right, it will return the throttle to 0 rpm (starving the motor). The motor
will never get a chance to recover and hence, stalls. This happened to my
car after my ex-mechanic "tuned" it for emissions.  The car passed WA state emissions and would stall at every stoplight on the way home. Needless
to say, I retuned the car. This was last December. 

The  "backfire"  I was experiencing when returning to idle from high revs
was solved with a little timing advance at the distributor. Maybe you should try it :}

I am considering getting rid of the decel valve circuit. I got mine from a VWbus at the graveyard--looks about right but I never checked the part
No. My car "originally" (meaning when I took over its care) had corks
plugging all the connections to the valve. Of course it had no charcoal
canister, either. 

So how many  of you have a decel valve? Any observations on their
function (besides emmissions necessity). Is it workable or advantageous
to remove it and plug the holes? Any effect on gas mileage? (Last tank =18.94 mpg w/ Bursch & Pertronix Point Eliminator)
