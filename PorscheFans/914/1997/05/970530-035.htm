I've only done it once when replacing pushrod tube seals which by the way is
surprising easy once you get the heat exchangers off. With the rear end raised
and roadwheels off, I used a broom handle leveraged between between two lug nuts
to rotate the engine to TDC on each cylinder. This provides more precise
positioning than bumping the starter (which seems bad for it anyway).
With both wheels off the ground, you must have someone hold the opposite hub in
similar fashion to keep it from turning.

Adjusting the valves was relatively easy with the heat exchangers removed.
I can't imagine how it's done with the heat exchangers on, but I understand
that's the usual practice. So I'd like to hear from others on the best way
to do this. Do any special tools help?

Question: I've heard a perfectly adjusted 914 described as sounding like a
sewing machine. I don't think mine does. Even after double-checking the
adjustments,
I still hear the valve train (tapping/clatter) louder than when the car was
relatively new. Could this be lifters or worn adjustment hardware? I doubt it
since this engine was professionally rebuilt 100k miles - about 12k miles back.
What can be done? 

Also, I'm thinking of changing to synthetic oil. What's the preferred brand and
weight? Any down-side other than cost? Does it stand up to heat better than
conventional oil?

Thanks for comments,
Alan - 76 914 2.0
