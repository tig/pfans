RE:
How about incorporating a small solid bar accross the top of the net, a
small steel rod would be sufficient. And affix it to the top of the A
pillar and the roll bar. 
Do you mean from the body's targa bar to the windshield frame (spanning the 
whole door opening)?  If so, it might work quite well, except that you have to 
undo the bottom and flip the whole thing onto the roof to get in and out.  
That's why I was looking for a door-mount solution; so I open the door and the 
net's out of the way.

Why did they want you to do that? 
I think so the Lexan back window won't pop out through the hole (it's only 
1/8" thick) as I top 125 on the main straight.  Something about slicing Turn 1 
course workers in two . . .

Mike, How'd your weekends events go? 
I felt like I was coming down with pneumonia after working a rungroup in a 
torrential downpour on Saturday, do didn't go back for Sunday or Monday.  On 
Saturday, I was appropriately humbled by a 2.3 liter (four) - his 67 seconds 
to my 72.  In our two-car class (PCA Modified under 2.5 liters) I was DFL, but 
I felt good because this was my shakedown cruise and the car was amazingly 
connected (our runs were before Nature's douche).  My goal is to continuously 
close the gap on him.

Mike
