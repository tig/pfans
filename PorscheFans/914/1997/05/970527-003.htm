JJ, step one, disconnect the TPS. Any change? Then rough in the timing
with the engine off. Rotate the engine to TDC, see if the rotor lines up
alright. Also, it sounds like the vac advance unit mey be giving you
problems. First thing though, you are disconnecting teh vac advance unit
fully when you check timing? Ok, this is a little weird, but with the
engine off, pull the car and rotor, and see if you can free up the vac
advance unit arm inside the dizzy. Then suck on one of the ports (use a
clean peice of hose) and see if the arm moves. Do both ports to see if
the unit is working properly. But it sounds like you probably are just
way badly timed. You said that you assumed that the timing didn't move.
We all know where assumptions lead us to now don't we? :) Check the
timing before you go get sniffed. And re-chack the valve clearances too.
You could also do the carb cleaner test with the engine running.
