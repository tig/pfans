Difficult to say given your description of the problem, but always 
make sure to set the idle after the car is warm and the AAR has 
closed.  It could be the AAR finally heating up and cutting the extra
air off from your intake.  You could test it by removing the vaccuum 
hose from the intake side of the AAR and closing it by hand.  

This is probably not the case tho...
