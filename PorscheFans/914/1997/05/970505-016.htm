	Haynes and the Factory manuals both kinda suck on this one.  All
Haynes says is "take it to the dealer", and the factory manual assumes
you have the EFI tester box (talk to RD Ricks if you really wanna buy
one).

	The ohmmeter readings are pretty simple--either 0 ohms (short
circuit) or infinity ohms (open circuit).  There are only four active
terminals on most 914 throttle switches--the "idle" contacts, and the
"accelerator pump" contacts.  Many switches also have a WOT contact, but
it is not used (except possibly on early 1.7s?).
	When at idle, you should see zero ohms across the idle contacts.
When not at idle, there should be no continuity--infinity ohms.
	When you open the throttle (but not when you close it!), you
will get 8-10 shifts from infinity to zero ohms and back across the "accel
pump" contacts.  Each one signals the brain to trigger an extra injection
pulse (on one or more, don't know how many, of the injectors).
	At WOT, you might see zero ohms from the WOT contact to the
"ground" contact you used for the "idle" measurement--but it doesn't
matter, because the ECU never sees that.  The "common" one is, I think,
the contact in the center of the plug.
	That's all there is to it.
