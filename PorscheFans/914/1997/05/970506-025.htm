Dirk,

Yes they where built at Karmann, but then most all limited run VWs where
built by Karmann.  The Beetle Cab, the Karmann - Ghia, the Scirrrocco(?),
the Corrado, and last but not least the VW Rabbit and Golf Cabs and the
Itlis I think..  The Ghia factory is well know for there sheet metal
capabilities, I have a 73 Ghia, all the seams where leaded.  Karmann like
others used spot welds exclusively.  All the parts by now where stamped,
and the original dyes turn up every now and again  in scrap yards in
Germany.  They had craftsmen that where very capable, but then they did
not use an exact jig so nothing happens twice exactly the same.  But that
can be an advantage, if you are lucky and had the one car that was off on
the wide side

 As far as books go, look in the Motorbooks Catalog, and see most of the
KG books will give you details about the factory operations.  Now I can
give you book names when I get home.  Also if you read German, the Das
Grossen VW und 914 Buch, also gives allot of details.

Take care,
Stephen Jacobs
