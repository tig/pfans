Bingo! You hit the nail on the head. That is exactly what I'm trying to
figure out. But the main issue for this car is as an autoxer and spin-up
of the motor is key. If I can elinate all that drag from the crankshaft,
the pay off might be worth it.

That's sortof what I'm thinking, but I would need a foolproof way of
knowing if the fan is turning or not. If the fan goes and I don't know,
the engine will get hot in a big hurry. Just like all those 911 pilots
who loose their fan belt.

It's a tricky issue. But constant speed is the easiest. The concern I
have is a situation like a long high speed WFO straight. And then snap
the throttle closed for a time. Shock-cooling comes to mind. With the
crank driven fan, air is delivered with revs, more revs, more heat, more
air is needed. Certainly there is lag due to the thermal mass of the
heads. But they were designed to radiate heat as efficiently as they
could (at the time they were designed), and can probably dump alot of
heat in a hurry. Shock-cooling is one reason that people can loose valve
seats in Type IV motors.

Well, when I come up with something brilliant (hah!), I'll let y'all
know. It's not like I don't have the time to think this over...
