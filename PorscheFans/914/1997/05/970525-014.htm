Howdy All, 

 The other day a Parts dealer David Buhain
  <PorscheParts@compuserve.com> posted some parts to the list and
apparently some of you didnt like it and Flamed him, granted it was a
long list, but I didnt mind and didnt see the big deal, but to each his
own.
 Anyway, I have delt with David several times to date and have gotten
good deals! and I call everyone before I buy and I was very Satisfied
with the prices on the New top latches, New rear roll bar pad, and today
I picked up my New 914 Gas tank. 
 So remember, before you fire up the Flame Thrower, think about the
bridges you might Burn........

 Don
 73 914-6 GT


 and Yes, I burned my AA bridge for a reason !!!!
