	Yah, what he said.  I also took the spark plugs out.
	As a side note for people who had to tear the whole thing
apart:  I could *not* get oil pressure.  At all.  Not even with 2-3
minutes solid cranking (plugs removed!).  At Mike L.'s suggestion, I
took a turkey baster (bought just for this purpose!) and squirted
oil up into the oil pickup tube.  (Very messy, BTW!)
	The oil light went out after 90 more seconds of cranking.
I speculate that the dry new pump couldn't suck hard enough to get
the oil up through the tube.  At least, not far enough.  I probably
didn't prime the pump with the baster, but I at least got some of
the tube primed.

	Whatever.  Those points probably aren't relevant to JJ, who
presumably didn't tear his motor down all the way.  But they're
till valid.
