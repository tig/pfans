	The impeller is not removed, just the blades.  The four "blocks"
that hold the front of the impeller (the pulley part) onto the back (the
driven part) are still left on.
	One of the locals has a car set up like this--I forget if he still
has an alternator or not.  Anyway, he ducts air from the headlight buckets
(headlights long gone) into a "Y" in the front trunk, into this "sewer
pipe" running through the cockpit to the edge of the fan.  That's a lot of
"ram air", and the engine *needs* it.  (Estimates of 160+ HP from 1.8L.)
He runs it for 20-30 minute races.  No clue on how many events the motor
lasts.

	For Steve:  I think Haynes lists the fan capacity in the specs in
the Engine section.  It's either the fan or the oil pump, because it was
referring to the "cooling system".
