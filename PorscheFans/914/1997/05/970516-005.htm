BFG has taken care of this problem.  The groove of doom afflicted early 2nd
generation R1's, especially if they were underinflated (some racers run
these around 20 psi).  I still have a set with this odd wearing and have
had no problems (solo and driver's ed).  the factory recommends pressures
of 34 front, 31 rear for the stock 914.  you will find that it is almost
impossible to get enough negative amber to wear the inside grooves.  I have
another set of Hoosiers (225x45x15) which has the roll radius similiar to
the 205x50's.  BFG does not make a 45 profile tire, thus the switch.  the
Hoosiers are lighter (fibreglass carcass), has less rubber (i.e. wear out
faster), but reputedly faster (when they last).
