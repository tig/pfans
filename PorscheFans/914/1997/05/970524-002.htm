So what. That rice-burner that just blew past you is your speeding
sponsor! Let _them_ get the ticket, they've obviously got money to burn.
And we all need every penny to feed our 'teeners eh? And then when you
get to the twisties, you can imagine the other drivers face as they
struggle in vain to keep up with this flat little thing that simply
dissapears. ZIP!

That's a reasonable goal to achive. But gains in HP may not help the
lb/HP quite as much with the newer engines, they're heavier. But yes,
the six is probably the best way to go.

My personal bias is probably always going to be towards an MFI engine, I
just think they're way cool. Also, a 2.7 case is a good bit lighter than
the 3.0+ cases. It depends on what you want out of it. Reliability and
lower maintenance, or the fun-factor. If reliability and maintenance are
the priorities, go for the 3.0 or 3.2 stock motors. They're pretty much
bomb-proof, and are much more tractable. As for a fun-factor motor, my
bias is towards an RSR engine. Of course other people will have differnt
prefernces, and some may say that the RSR engine is just all wrong. But
then, I'm not other people... :)

It's not really a total wash. The smaller displacement motors have to
make sacrifices to gain the same power as the larger displacement
engines. Things like low end torque, power band width, ease of
maintenance, and overall lifetime. Food for thought. There's no such
thing as free power, and almost every mod you do one of these motors
will be a trade off somewhere. Things like cams will give you lots of
kick at higher rpms, but rob it of alot of bottom end power and possibly
make the idle difficult.
