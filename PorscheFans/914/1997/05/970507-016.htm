Hello 914'ers,

I just wanted to shed light on a problem that I had, in case any of you =
run into it.  I have a '74 1.8L which I bought a year ago.  This is my =
first 914, and have very little, if any, experience with them.  After I =
laid eyes on this car, though, I had to have it.  Anyways...on to the =
problem.

Problem:  Hot or cold, the 914 would idle @ 2500rpm and drop to 0, then =
back up to 2500, then back to 0 and so on.

Since this is my first experience w/ a 914, I got on a few 914 pages and =
searched to come up with some common fixes for this same problem.

Possible Solutions:  Temperature sensor 1, Head Temp Sensor (2), and/or =
vacuum leaks.

The first thing I did was replace the Head Temp Sensor, since I cannot =
find the Temp. Sensor #1.  (Probably removed)  That didn't change =
anything.  I then proceeded to check all vacuum hoses and replaced any =
that could be questionable.  Same problem.  Then, after a few days of =
swearing at myself for not being a certified 914 (or any other) =
mechanic, I was checking the throttle body to see if maybe it was loose. =
 It was snug, but the Throttle valve air by-pass screw was turned out =
about 5 full turns from the throttle body itself.  I turned it in until =
it seated against the TB, then turned it out a quarter of a turn (since =
I can't find in the manual, where it should actually be).  Turned the =
motor, and whalla (yes, whalla) it worked.  It idled at about 900rpm or =
so.  I couldn't believe it was something as simple as this, and it had =
me churning inside for a bit.  Does anyone, by chance, know a 'normal' =
setting for this by-pass screw?  Are there any local 914'ers here in my =
area....Virginia Beach, Va.?
Hope this helps anyone who may run into this later...

Thanks, and take care.
