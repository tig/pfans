    Yes, Michael... If the cage doesn't fit PRECISELY in the car,
    something has to give.  Since the cage is enormously more rigid
    than the car into which you're putting it, it's usually the
    floor of the car that twists or bends a few degrees.

    This "problem" isn't limited to weld-in cages, by the way;
    cars with bolt-in cages can suffer from it as well.

    Yeah, you'd need all that stuff.
