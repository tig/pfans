914Fans,

I just had to pass this along.  Our local autocross club had their first
driver's school of the season on Saturday, with the corresponding autocross
event on Sunday.  Unfortunately, (specially for my driving's sake) I was
unable to participate in the driver's school because we painted my 914 on
Saturday.  The car turned out great, and I can finally see the light at the
end of the tunnel.

We had time to run over to the school and check out my Mother (driving my
ACR) and my Brother driving his 'new' generation 1 RX7.  They both were
doing an outstanding job, but what drew my initial attention was the new
Boxster lined up behind my Mom.  It turns out a lady in our club who ran a
Miata last year fell in love with the Boxster and bought one of the first
ones available in our area.  She knows I'm into 914's and immediately let
me crawl all over the car and check it out.  I had my helmut with me, so I
jumped in with her when she was doing one of her free runs at the end of
the day.  

Maybe it was the huge grin on my face or the fluid escaping from the corner
of my mouth, but after 2 runs, she put it in nuetral, pulled the emergency
brake, and handed me the keys!  She also got out of the car and said she
didn't like riding with other people, but would rather watch me take it
around.  I'm not going to try to describe the experience in detail, but all
I can say is WOW!  Maybe there is better cars out there, maybe not, but I
was in love.

Now, back to the 914...

	Dion
