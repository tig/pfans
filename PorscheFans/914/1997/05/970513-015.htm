Nick,

I had the same questions last year at this time. Suggested reading:

* Bruce Anderson't Porsche Performance Guide, available from Border's
and Automotion -- all the specs, lots of configuration info, lots of
cost comparison data

* Paul Frere's _The Racing Porsches_ which covers the development of the
904/910 cars and drivelines in great detail.

I also asked a gazillion present Porsche owners, especially those who'd had
more than one car, and unlimited access [$$$, junkyard owners, racers].
MANY of these people named the '72-3 911E [2.4] driveline as their 'favorite
for street use'. This is a 165hp, wide torque band, very tractable combo
that will
give great street performance in a 914 .. without undue consideration for
the fragility of transmission, axle, motor mount and associated wheelspin/
tire wear/body modification/cooling/smog/$$electronics type of headachesthat
one might want to avoid in a "daily driver".

Assuming you want a motor with high reliability [rebuilt with Porsche parts
by a reliable mechanic] be prepared to spend $8-10000 in parts; + labor. For
a 2.4. [$2K+ for a decent used motor; $3K+ for rebuild; $2K for interfaces
[mounts, tanks, clutch, controls]; $1-4K for other required stuff [tranny
mods, wheels, brakes, etc]].

Double this for a 3.2, with lots of corners cut [tranny, body mods kept to
a minimum]. Expect to eat clutches and axles like candy. 
Since used, complete motors are $7K+, you may be HARD PRESSED to complete a
well-balanced 3.2 conversion for only $15K. 

It takes A LOT of money to have a 3.2L car "done right". I've seen one
example: $41,000 and counting. [3.2 dual-plug, DME'd, cage, C2T wheel'd,
bremtek'd, steel flared, G50'd, stripped, rotiss'd, stiffened, lacquered,
and re-plated]
