>Well, I started out with a rather thick, wide (2 in.) piece of brass with two
>small holes drilled in either end.  The problem here was that the brass was
>too thick to "mold" itself around the rings properly, and so wide that the
>friction between it and the piston prevented it from easily sliding down.  I
>returned to the hardware store and bought another piece about 3/4 in. wide
>and substantially thinner.  This fit perfectly around the piston, but was so
>thin that the cylinder slid over it as well!  I took a pair of vice-grips and
>gently bent several small "tabs" out on its edge.  I was able to get one of
>the cylinders on using this, but none of the others seem to let the brass
>slide unless I make it so loose that the rings catch on the edge of the
>cylinder.  I then reverted back to the original ring compressor that I
>purchased last year.  Its band is shaped similar to the "squiggly" oil ring
>around the piston, and thus doesn't slide into the cylinder at all.  It's a
>pain in the ass to get off once I get the piston in, but it worked for
>getting the rest of the cylinders on.  So, I'm passed that hurdle, and the
>rest looks like relatively clear-sailing from here on out.  Of course, we all
>know that once I get the engine back in the car I'll discover that I forgot
>to put the base gaskets on one of the cylinders, and have to tear the whole
>thing apart again...

>Thanks for everyone's advice!
