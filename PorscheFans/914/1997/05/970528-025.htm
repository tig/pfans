This is a *street* car we are talking about here.  Come on, guys.  Do you want
this owner's teeth to be rattled out of his skull on long trips?.

Progessives would be okay if they aren't any stiffer than the 100 lbs at sedate
handling levels.  100 lbs is about as much as I would wanna go fo a street car
unless the progressives *really* are progessive.

I've got Koni's front and rear with the stock springs, and its a *hard* ride.
Many folks think the Bilsteins rear will soften the ride a bit without loss
of performance.  I'd highly recommend that.

Also, the adjustable ride height might have been suggested to handle some
sagging springs, but with *new* springs, the ride height should be perfect
without adjustment, if you get the 914 shocks.

So, make the ride livable and don't get too extreme on either shocks or springs.
For street, the Boge's just might be adequate.  It's not like they were designed
for a landyacht kinda ride.
