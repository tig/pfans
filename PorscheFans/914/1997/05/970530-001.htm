  The ignition circuit is a fairly simple one, assuming you have the stock points-type ignition, and 
have not converted to an electronic ignition.
   The basic theory of operation is as follows:  (Conventional current flow used.)

    Current flows from the battery through the ignition switch to the coil + terminal.  It then flows through 
the coil primary winding, out the - terminal of the coil and then through the points in the distributor, and 
thence to ground via the distributor body.  While this current is flowing, energy is stored in the form of 
a magnetic field in the iron core of the coil.  When the engine rotates to the correct point for a spark to 
occur, a cam in the distributor opens the points.  The magnetic field in the coil core collapses 
abruptly, and as it does so, induces a very high voltage in the secondary winding of the coil.  This 
high voltage is conducted via the distributor cap and rotor to the appropriate spark plug, where it 
jumps the plug gap and ignites the mixture.

   There are two basic causes for lack of spark.  Either the coil is never energized, or it is never 
de-energized.  To determine which, proceed as follows:

  Your list is conspicuous by it's failure to include points and condenser and a general check of the 
distributor proper.  These things are important, but let's start at the beginning so that the procedure is 
systematic.  
   First, you will need a good voltmeter.  Radio Shack sells some digital meters that are fairly 
in-expensive, and readily available.   Most automotive dwell meters can accomplish all of the tests 
that I am about to outline, and in addition can check dwell angle, so one of these might be a good 
investment instead.
  When you have the necessary test rquipment, begin by measuring the voltage on the coil + terminal 
with respect to battery negative (ignition on).  It should be close to 12 volts.  If not, the problem is in 
the wiring from the battery through the ignition switch to the coil.  Since this involves several sets of 
interconnections, the only thing to do is get out the Haynes book or some other wiring diagram and 
work through the pieces one at a time until you find where the voltage goes away.  To prove the 
case, you can "hot-wire" the car.  Remove the existing wire from the coil + terminal, connect a clip 
lead from the coil + terminal to the positive terminal of the battery.  You should have plenty of sparks.

  If you do have 12 volts on the coil + terminal, measure the voltage on the coil - terminal.  It might be 
either the same as on the + terminal, or it might be close to zero.  If it is zero, turn the ignition off, 
disconnect the green wire from the distributor and the tachometer sensing wire from the harness from 
the coil - terminal, turn the ignition on and measure again.  If still zero, the coil is bad.  If 12 volts is now 
present on the - terminal, reconnect the tach wire from the harness.  The voltage should remain.  If it 
goes to zero, there is a short in the wiring to the tach, or the tach is bad.  In this event, leaving this wire 
disconnected will allow the engine to run, although you will have no tachometer.  Next, turn the 
ignition off and reconnect the green wire from the distributor to the coil - terminal.  Turn the ignition 
back on.  With the distributor cap removed, turn the engine until the points are observed to open.  (If 
they don't open, they need adjustment or replacement.)  The distributor - terminal voltage should 
now be close to 12 volts.  If not, the condenser is bad; replace it.

  In the event that the coil - terminal cannot be observed to go to zero volts (or close to it) then again 
observe the points with the distributor cap removed.  They should close (touch) with the engine in a 
position such that the operating block for the points is  between cam lobes.  If not, the points need 
adjusting or replacing.  Try sticking a screwdriver into the point gap momentarily; if they are not 
closing, this should short them and allow the coil - terminal to go to zero.  If the voltage is still 12 volts, 
or is hovering erratically between 12 volts and ground, it is likely that the distributor breaker plate 
grounding braid has failed.  Measure from the breaker plate in the distributor to the battery ground.  If 
you see any voltage above a few tenths of a volt, the grounding braid has probably failed.

  Be sure to check the points for burning, pitting, and excessive wear (loss of contact block material).  
If any of these conditions are present, replace the points and condenser, and try again.  Use a dwell 
meter (preferred) or the feeler gauge method to set the points as outlined in the Haynes book.

  Good Luck!

  Here's all I know about adjusting valves:

   The 1.7 litre engine specs out at .006" clearance for both intake and exhaust valves.
  If you set a valve .001" looser than spec, it might be a bit noisier, but 
you will not harm anything.  Setting an exhaust valve .002" too tight will 
risk burning it... not a good idea! 

   My general notes on adjustment are these:  
 First, a correctly adjusted valve will put a slight 
amount of drag on the feeler gauge as it is moved back and forth.  If 
the gauge slips in with no resistance at all, the valve is too loose.  If 
you have to strain, and the feeler gauge feels like it wants to sproing 
into an inchworm shape instead of going in, the valve is too tight.  
There should be just a little bit of drag on the gauge; enough so that 
you can detect a friction effect, even with oil present.
  Once you have this feel in mind, stick in the appropriate gauge and 
measure the clearance... as in fortran, you have three choices: <  >  or 
=.  By the way, one should use one's other hand to put pressure on the 
pushrod end of the rocker to take up all play on that end while making 
the measurement.  This is fairly easy to do in most cars;  I have never 
tried it on a 914 with the engine in the car... if it is not possible to get 
both hands in there, don't worry about it.
  Once you have determined which way you need to go, loosen the 
lock nut, turn the screw a bit in the correct direction, and re-tighten the 
lock nut.  Repeat until the clearance is correct; i.e. slight drag on the 
feeler gauge with ALL TOOLS OFF THE VALVE TRAIN!  There should 
never be any tool on the rocker assembly, either screwdriver or 
wrench, while actually measuring the clearance.  You will introduce 
side loads or other moments that will prevent an accurate 
measurement.
  This procedure is a bit cumbersome, and is the reason that I 
take as many short cuts as possible... hence the trick of turning the 
engine until certain valves are rocking, and then adjusting certain other 
valves.  

  Here is how that works:

  I should like to point out that the 914-4 enine is a derivitive of the 
good old VW engine designed by Dr. Porsche way back when.  As the 
"people's car"  everything, including the engine, was designed for 
cheap mass production.  As part of this philosophy, Dr. Porsche 
reasoned (I take license here) something like this:  "Why should I 
design a typical 4-cylinder engine camshaft with 8 lobes, when I can 
get by with half that number?"  Due to the flat-four layout, each cam 
lobe does double duty, actuating a valve first on one side of the 
engine, and then on the other.  
  This then gives rise to a simplified adjustment procedure, which I have 
printed up and glued into my Haynes manual to replace the rather 
cumbersome procedure in the book. 
  I quote verbatim:

1.  Jack up car and place on stands;   block one road wheel 
to prevent it's turning, engage 5th gear, handbrake off.
2.  Valve clearances are adjusted with the engine COLD.  Clearances 
are INTAKE = .006"  EXHAUST = 006".  (1.7 litre)  Remove 
valve covers, clean up spilled oil, and check gaskets; renew if 
necessary.
3. Using the unblocked roadwheel as a handwheel, rotate engine 
until the rockers are rocking in accordance with the first entry in the 
table below.  Adjust the clearances of the corresponding valves as 
shown in the table.  Continue rotating engine and adjusting valves until 
all have been done.  Re-install valve covers and unblock road wheel.
4.  Valve adjustment table:  # denotes cylinder number; Ex = Exhaust 
valve;  In = Intake valve.

Turn until Rocking:                     Adjust:

#2 Ex & #3 In                           #4 Ex & #1 In
#1 Ex & #2 In                           #3 Ex & #4 In
#4 Ex & #1 In                           #2 Ex & #3 In
#3 Ex & #4 In                           #1 Ex & #2 In

  It follows logically that a valve opposite one that is open is on the 
back of the same cam lobe, the perfect place for adjustment.  It is only 
necessary to be certain of which valves actually share the same cam 
lobe, which can be a little tricky owing to the offset nature of the 
cylinder layout.  However, I believe that I have done this, and that 
further, I have worked it out so that, if the valves are adjusted in the 
order given in the table, a minimum amount of engine rotation will be 
necessary to complete the task.

                                                                        Good Luck,
                                                  Jim T.
