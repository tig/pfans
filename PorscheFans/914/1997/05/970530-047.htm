Jerry, with shorter lowering springs on the car you may find that with the
rear of the car jacked up, the spirng may not be under much tension.  I've
adjusted the lower spring clip on cars with the shock/spring still on the
car.  I've just pushed up on the lower perch which removes any remaining
tension on the spring clip, then quickly moved the clip to the next lower
position.

The fact that your car is low should not in and of itself induce preload.
It's always a good idea when changing ride height or sway bar position, to
check for preload.  I'm not aware of anyone producing an adjustable drop
link for the factory bars. With some work, you could probably make some.
