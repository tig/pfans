After about 15-20,000 miles, drain the oil and compare it to new oil. IF 
it's *really* dirty, then you have a problem and are going to need a 
rebuild, since the wear in that period should be negligible. Wear shows 
up as dark and dirty looking oil.


Actually, since all of the oil doesn't come out when you change it, it
would have been better to do a few (2-3) quick changes with cheaper oil
over say 1,000 miles intervals. This would clean out allof the old oil,
then you could have put Swepco in for the 20,000 mile test. 

Actually, plane jane GL5 gear oil is fine for these transaxles, since it's
*much* better than what was available 25 years ago. My opinion is that
it's more economical to use less expensive oil and change it often, rather
than using a more expensive oil and keeping it in there longer. Porsche
recommended gear oil changes every other engine oil change - virtually no
one has done that with these cars, resulting in lots of worn out
transmissions.
