I have enjoyed reading the different comments on the 3.0L/3.2L applications
in the 914.  I am very happy to hear someone is taking the time to work out
the details with CIS and DME installations for these cars.  I am kind of fond
of the 914 with carburators, especially on the sixes as they bring up
memories of the earlier racing days at Porsche and carbs were the stock
application for the 914-6.  In my opinion they just look right in the 914s
engine bay.  
I have had the oportunity of tuneing both the 46IDA and 40IDA carburator on a
stock 3.0L in a 914.  The 46's definately produce more midrange and top end
power but are very bad on the low end and consume gas to the tune of 16 MPG
on the highway.  The 40's are definately better in the range of RPM most of
us use 50 to 75% of the time.  Low end response is better than the 46's and
they produce better fuel economy in the 20 to 22 MPG for highway driving.  
If anyone out there is having problem making the 40's work on the 3.0L I
suspect there is more "wrong" than just tuning.  Bruce Anderson's jetting
suggestions are a good starting point but may need to be changed to suite the
exhaust, distributor and ignition you are useing.  The early ('78/'79) CIS
distributor will work fine on a carburated car when timed correctly.  Set
your distributor for full advance at 5K and don't worry about it at idle.
 "Trust me on this one" is the line used by a 911 engine builder who
definately knew his stuff when he gave me this tip.  If the distributor is
working correctly and you nail it down to 34 degrees advance at 5K you should
be set.  I went through having a distributor recurved and know from first
hand testing the stock one timed correctly will work every bit as good.
Throttle response in side by side testing with a stock '80 "CIS" SC and a '76
carburated SC (with a stock 3.0L) seems to prove the carbs are much better
"off the line".  0 to 60 times are about a half a second faster in the
carburated car.  Both engines were at the 60 to 75K mileage range and the
engine in the '76 just happened to be originally out of an '80 SC.
Good luck to every one working out the CIS and DME conversions.  Let us know
how the projects progress.
