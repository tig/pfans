I assume you figured out that they are some type of valve lash adjusters? 
The "8mm" and "10mm" refer to the diameter of the threaded part of the
adjusters. The stock adjuster is basically a stud with a hardened and
rounded tip on it to engage the valve. We're talking about the rocker arms
in the cylinder heads, BTW. Swivel feet are replacements for the stock
threaded studs. Instead of a hardened and rounded tip, there is a ball and
socket arrangement where the socket part is shaped like a truncated cone,
the bottom of which engages the end of the valve stem.  When the rocker
moves to open the valve, the bottom of this truncated cone touches the end
of the valve stem and stays put while the ball-and-socket portion rocks in
response to the motion of the rocker arm. The result is that the ends of
the valves suffer much less wear, and the valves stay in adjustment for
longer. They also relieve side loading on the valve stem, I believe, which
would dramatically reduce valve guide wear. They are standard issue on 911
motors, and a standard upgrade in the air-cooled VW world. But those of us
with 10mm adjusters are stuck with having to replace the rockers
themselves to get 8mm threaded holes to mount these type of adjusters. VW
went to the larger adjuster size in their larger motors I assume because
they had problems with the smaller diameter ones. They don't make changes
like that for no reason, so I'm hesitant to change back to smaller 8mm
ones. 

I was lamenting the lack of 10mm adjusters, hence my query. Hope this
helps.
