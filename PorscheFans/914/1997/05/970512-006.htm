The answer is TINY TINY TINY speakers.  I was lucky enough to find 
a beautiful '73 interior for my car including the original Bosch
radio with short-wave.  Now, not that I could even strain to hear the
radio with the engine running, I decided to install it as a matter of
principle.  

I found that I could only squeeze something like 3x5" speakers behind
those grills on the floor.  So, I just put in a pair of cheap Radio
Shack jobs. (Come to think of it, the 3x5"s might of even been too
large - could be smaller).
