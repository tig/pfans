Can anyone give me a vacuum profile on a relatively stock engine & or
comparisons from other built motors???

another new dilemma with my fresh hydralik motor... there are no leaks
that i can find, BUT i have only 5-6 in vac at 900 idle, (which
apparently tells the presure sensor it should open up the fuel spigots), 

 once the rpm hits 1200, the vac comes up around 9 in., then hits 17 at
3500 rpm in nuetral.. on the road under steady throttle, 2500rpm i see
10"... snap test & full decel pull 20" density altitude is about 3000
for these readings. 
Have tried blocking the engine pcv breather, but this has no effect
either way..  Air leaks & Late valve timing are textbook cause, so i'm
still fiddling with hyd lifter adjustment to see if it has any effect...
currently @ 1 1/2 turns from zero...more than MSHP recommends, about
same as Web says, using a web 91H cam, intake opens 9' btdc, exh opens
45' bbdc, only a bit less than stock & similar to bus 2 liter hyd cam...
compression is 125-130...  ign timing 27 @ 3500 & 10 @ 900 (1.7 dist) 

overall, the engine runs well & pulls strong up thru 5000... but is
obviously on the rich side of lambda.. scope check & power balance at
idle do not reveal anything, killing injectors one each also indicates
relatively good balance... what am I MISSING??
