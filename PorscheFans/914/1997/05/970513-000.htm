Greetings, 914-er's!

  I thought that I'd jump in and muddy the waters a bit.  I was once told that trying to develop oil 
pressure while cranking a freshly rebuilt engine was the worst thing you could do to it.  Remember, 
the oil pump turns at half the speed of the crank, so while cranking, this is pretty slow - witness Dave 
D.'s inability to develop oil pressure until he "primed" the pump.  All the while he was cranking, he 
had parts turning with no oil pressure, and no splash lubrication either.
  I hope to get my engine back in the car this weekend (so I won't be able to make it to Solvang for 
the Renegade group get-together) but when I fire it up, I will do just as I have with every other engine 
that I have ever rebuilt... get it to 1500 RPM or so (750 RPM for the oil pump) as quickly as possible, 
and hold it there until I see oil pressure.   ( I do intend to pre-fill the filter.)  After that, drive it.  I do agree 
with not holding the RPM constant during break-in, though, and an early oil change... but 500 miles or 
so on the original oil ought to be no problem.
   I don't expect the engine to last as long as a totally fresh rebuild, but that's only because the bottom 
end has 60K miles on it already.  I'll give you a report.

                                                  Regards,
                                                  Jim T.
