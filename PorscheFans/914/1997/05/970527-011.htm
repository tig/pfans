I think you'll find people split on this issue.  I've heard it
argued that the 914 powerplant wasn't designed for use with a 
hydraulic cam and hydraulic tappet setup and they aren't worth
the trouble.

Others like to "set-and-forget" their valve clearances and opt
to go hydraulic.  Personally - I stick with stock or modified
non-hydraulic cams and tappets and crawl under the car to adj.
valves accordingly.  Once you've done it a few times, you can
do it in under an hour.

I lack the technical expertise to know exactly the pros and cons
of going hydraulic and know little about how doing so eliminates
the need for adjusting your valves every 3k...

A few cents worth...
