I am sorry yet glad to report that I will be withdrawing from the list
(not that any recent members will notice, I haven't been really active
in a while) because I have accepted a job in Cleveland and will be
moving there this Thursday.  I am not sure as of yet if I will have
email access or if I will have to save my pennies and buy my home
computer so I am unsubscribing so that my Andrew account will not fill
up between the rare occasions that I will be able to check it.

I'll miss getting all that mail from you guys, especially those whose
names I have come to instantly recognize over the past few years... even
though I've only actually met one list member in the flesh (and that was
back in the days of Porschephiles!) I feel like I know a lot of you
folks.

Anyway, it's a beautiful day out, even here in Pittsburgh, so what are
you doing sitting in front of a computer!  Go for a drive or something!

later,

nate
