Greetings, 914-er's!

  At last... it runs, and it's registered (sort of).   A tale worth boring you with?  To find out, read on.

  Saturday, May 17.  Enlist aid of next-door neighbor...  assemble gearbox to engine and re-install in 
car.
  Sunday, May 18.  Spend afternoon after church hooking up plumbing and wiring.
  Monday, May 19.  Spend morning running around getting insurance coverage and temporary 
operating permit to drive it to smog inspection station.  Also while at Auto Club, get reprint of current 
non-op certificate, as I can't find mine.  Spend afternoon finishing plumbing and wiring.  Fire up car.  
After warmup, engine starts regular miss.  Discover cylinder #4 (original cylinder with low 
compression prompting last teardown) not contributing anything.  Check compression. Zero.  Tear 
out large handfuls of hair.  Get inspiration.  Crawl under car, burn hands, but discover #4 intake valve 
so tight it will not close fully.  Adjust for some click with engine at about 150 degrees.   Check 
compression again.  O.K.  Warm up engine.  Compression still good.
  Tuesday, May 20.  Drive car to smog inspection station.  Good guy.  Knows about 2500 RPM 
problem on Porsches.  Car passes HC fine now (failed before teardown due to blow-by) but CO at 
2500 just misses.  Smog guy says, I will find an RPM where it passes with machine A, and then push 
the go button on machine B to record real test.  Two sensors from two machines up tail pipe.  Hunt for 
"sweet spot" in RPM range... found it about 2400.  Test almost passed.  Then smog tech says:  "Hey, 
what's happening... it's missing!"  HC readings gone to pot.  Sure enough, back to running on three 
cylinders.  Quickly pull plug wires to find culprit, discover #1 this time.  Second inspiration:  pull 
injector wire off injector.  (No fuel in defective cylinder.)  Smog guy says,  "O.K., HC coming back 
down to normal.  You pass."  Tip the guy, and pay for certificate.  Run home, and adjust intake 
valves on #1, 2, and 3.  No measurement, just get some hot clearance.  Burn hands good in the 
process.
  Jump in 914, and fire up.  No more missing.  Drive to Auto Club.  Present paperwork.  Find out that 
Calif. DMV computers freeze transactions on a given vehicle for about 5 days.  Printing out the 
duplicate non-op certificate the previous day locks me out until about Friday.  Moan and cry, and get 
temporary red sticker to put on car to enable me to drive it until Friday.  Run home to take top off and 
pick up lug wrench (just in case) before going to pick up daughter from school in her new 914.  Wave 
at 911 on the way home.  Get a wave back, but also a startled look.  Pull into driveway, discover 
huge cloud of smoke rising from right side heat exchanger.  Trail of oil into driveway.  Quick look 
under car; discover right side valve cover not installed properly after "quickie" valve adjust.  
Remove and re-install valve cover with CHT reading 350 degrees.  OUCH!!  Jump in car, make it to 
school with 5 minutes to spare.

  Just another average day in the life of a 914 owner.
                                                  Regards,
                                                  Jim T.
