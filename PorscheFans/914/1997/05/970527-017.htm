Subject: Plug Wires & Air-Seals -- How-To

In a message dated 97-05-22 00:46:22 EDT, you write:

<< Not sure what you mean by the Corvair-type air seal, but if it's the
large,
 thick one that snaps into the tin like a grommet, I couldn't get those to
 work on my type IV tin because two of the holes in the tin (#2,4) do not
go
 in flush all the way around.  >>

David and the List,

Yes, 'grommet' is an apt description of the Corvair seals (with apologies
to
Wallace).

The spark-plug access hole in SP tin-ware is about 1.375" in diameter,
virtually identical to the Corvair engine.  Corvair air-seals have a groove
diameter of about 1.40", resulting in a nice  fit.  The holes in DP
tin-ware
however are ovals, which means the Corvair plug must be modified to fit the
asymmetrical opening.

In the center of the Corvair air-seals, on the inner side, there is a
central
lip
about one-eighth of an inch thick by three-eighths of an inch deep designed
to grip the insulating sleeve on the end of the spark plug.  To make
Corvair
seals fit on DP engines you must cut away either the lip or a portion of
the
insulator on the wire.  That allows the seal to assume an oval shape, which
it otherwise would resist.  Once the  outer lip clips around the rim of the
hole in the tin-ware, the seal will be locked into place despite its
distortion.

On Type IV's the problem is similar but with two significant differences.
 The first difference is that on Type IV tin-ware the spark-plug access
hole
is smaller, about 1.2" in diameter, measured at #1 or #3, the only holes
that
are nicely round.  #2 and #4 are distinct ovals, #4 having a longer
major-axis than #2.  But the minor axis remains about 1.20", apparently
reflecting a minimum tool- or part- dimension.

To make Corvair air-seals with their 1.4" groove diameter fit the 1.2"
holes
in the Type IV tin-ware, cut away a small segment of the angled inner lip
of
the air-seal at three or four points, located symmetrically around the
circumference of the lip -- three points are sufficient for the nearly
round
holes on cylinders 1 & 4 but you'll need four -- or more -- notches in the
lip to allow the lip to engage the oval-shaped holes on cylinders 2 & 4.

Notching the lip allows the thing to work because it's made of rubber --
you
can compress it into a smaller diameter quite easily once you've provided
some 'crush-space' for the thing to compress into.  And as before, once the
lip snaps around the rim of the hole, the natural elasticity of the
material
provides a secure grip.

The second problem is the larger size of the spark-plug insulator used on
Type IV engines.  I've forgotten which is which but on two of the cylinders
the insulator makes contact with the air-seal (I think this is the problem
on
#2 & #4 -- help me out on this, David).  In order for the air-seal to
compress -- and so fit the OVAL hole in the tin-ware -- the center lip of
the
air-seal must be cut away entirely, and in order for the air-seal to
compress
into an oval, the central inner part -- the hole where the wire goes --
must
be cut away to accomodate the resulting oval shape, that is, a bit more cut
away on two sides.

This is a fairly simple task yet is remarkably difficult to describe --
the
circular air-seal with its circular central opening will be installed in an
oval-shaped hole and must accomodate a circular insulator in the center.
To
allow that to happen you must begin with an oval-shaped hole for the
central
insulator... which becomes a circular hole once the outer part of the
air-seal is fastened into the oval shaped opening in the tin-ware.
 (Re-reading that, it sounds like topological gobbledy-gook even to me...
and
I've done the mod several times.)

Number 4 is the most difficult seal to install since the oval opening is
thru
a reverse-compound curve  (think of a cowboy's saddle)  -- the tin-ware is
bending around a downward corner in a plane parallel with the major axis of
the opening, (ie, toward the stirrups),  while curving upward along the
minor
axis (ie, toward the saddle-horn and back).   In this case, the 'back of
the
saddle' is the bend that accomodates the oil cooler, and is fairly steep.
  Slippery with rubber lube and working with your arm extended, it's
difficult to provide the downward pressure needed to make the outer lip of
the seal snap over the edges of the opening.  But it WILL go on.  And stay
there, once in place.  Don't be gentle with the thing -- you have to really
push on it.

The topology of the #2 opening is similar to #4 but without the oil cooler,
the curve is a simple-compound and the air-seal is much easier to install
than in #4.  Numbers 1 & 3 install very easily, the only difficulty being
the
extended position of your arm.  If you have a hatch in the cargo bay you
could probably pop the things in with your toes. :-)

Then there's the sleeve.  I remember cutting one.  I can't remember why.  I
haven't done one of these in a while and I can't recall if I used a protion
of the spark-plug insulating sleeve that was supplied with the wiring (and
assembled to it) as a sleeve in the Type IV wiring mod.   I may have needed
the sleeve as a result of cutting the oval-shaped hole too large.   But I
know I ended up with a neat wiring layout and an air-tight set of seals.

As difficult as this modification is to describe, the work itself is
relatively simple and the results are well worth the effort.  You'll end up
with a new set of silicon wires, assuming you replace those presently
installed,  and air-tight seals.  Only common tools are needed and the mod
is
a one-time sort of job, or at worst need be repeated only every ten years
or
so.  Once the air-seals are modified, and after they've been on the engine
for a time, they'll take a set, thereafter they can be plugged-in and
removed
without difficulty, certainly much easier than on the dual-port upright
engine, which is like having four #4 cylinders, as compared to the Type IV
--
and postioned where they can not be seen just to make things more
interesting.
