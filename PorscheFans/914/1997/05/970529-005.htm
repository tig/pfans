Why not bring back the 916 front-end for your concept 914?  
Fits nice, looks nice, has cutout for oil cooler if you want
to mount one up front.  

I know they are available in 'glass in the aftermarket.  
(I have a set front and rear as well as flares which I 
 haven't done anything with yet...too many other things to
 think about 1st)
