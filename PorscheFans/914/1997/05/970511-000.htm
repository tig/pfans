Yes, in the corner between the pasenger side fender and the firewall
that abutts the gas tank. This allowed me to also store and secure an
inflatable spare from a mid-80s 911. The original spare bolt is used
through one of the lug holes, instead of the center.

In the new Summit Racing catalog, they have a gorgeous aluminum battery box,
complete with cover and mounting, and [it says] both a mounting shoe and
straps. A little pricey at $90, but it appears to be nicely finished, with
the added advantage of protecting the terminals from accidental contact.

Summit also has a 'bulkhead' which is a set of contact terminals surrounded
by a threaded piece of plastic conduit. Looks real useful for making the
junction between the rear firewall and engine bay. I routed 4/0 welding
wire through the existing ferule that routes the headlamp wiring, down the
drivers side compartment under the carpet, and back to the starter, where the
charging circuit is also terminated. Welding wire is very flexible, with a
neoprene jacket.
