Matt,

I have to congratulate you asking probably the most often debated topic
on this list. I have my own biases, but I will try and give you a run
down of what we all have discussed in the past.

First off, I have to ask what application you need/want the external
cooler for? For competition? Or just to try and keep the engine temps
down, with no particular intentions on club competition? The reason why
I ask this is that if you intend on entering _any_ club competition,
determine what class you wish to compete in and prepare your car to
_those_ rules. Some classes in some clubs do not allow any mods to the
oiling or cooling systems of your car and will bump you into a higher
class with cars that have alot more preparation and money poured into
them. Not neccessarilly faster, just richer. Faster is usually the
driver, but that's another topic. If you are going for competition, let
us know what class you intend on driving in, and what the rules are, and
we can be better equiped to help you out.

So, with that out of the way, let's assume you want this for a street
car that sees lots of fun twisty roads and you like to keep the revs in
the fun zone. If this is not the case and your 914 is simply a commuter,
and you are experiencing overheating problems, then there is a problem
in your car and that should be addressed before installing any after
market hardware. Ok, back to our premise...

You want something affordable, and compatible with the existing stock
system. Last point first. Most, if not all, aftermarket oil cooler
installations are entirely compatible with the stock system. They will
most always involve a spin-on adapter which is a sandwich plate that
goes inbetween the oil filter and the engine. Oil lines then attach to
this adapter and can then be routed to the oil cooler and location of
your choice. Oil coolers, there are _many_ different ones, the budget
cooler of choice is an oil cooler out of a mazda RX-7. It has
significant surface area, and good flow characteristics. They can be
found, if you're patient, at a good salvage yard for a reasonable price.
Beyond that, we get to what fits, and usually at retail prices. And that
brings us to location. Just like real estate, the big debate over oil
coolers for the 914 is location, location, location. 

Without much argument, the best location for an aux oil cooler is up
front on (or in) the nose of the car. There you have cold, high pressure
air flow. This is of course, the most arduous installation location.
Requiring alot of oil line, cutting of sheet metal to rout the lines,
cutting of metal to vent the heated air, and a healthy amount of extra
oil to keep the sump full while running. Alot of people decide to mount
the cooler closer to the engine to keep installation costs and
difficulty to a minimum. Some prefer to hang the cooler next to the
transaxle on the right side. Decent air flow, and easy to install with
minimal oil lines, and no cutting of sheet metal. Some prefer to hang
the cooler on the engine lid, not quite as convinient, but minimal oil
lines, cooler air, and out of harms way of road debris. Debris is a very
real concern, punch a hole in the cooler, and you either stop right then
and there and get a tow home, or toast your engine in a very short time.

It is pretty much an agreed upon fact that if you're installing a large
aux oil cooler, a neccessary component is an oil thermostat. This is a
handy device for keeping oil pressure in the cooler low while the oil is
still heavy and cold. As the oil warms up, so the pressure through the
cooler increases. This is to prevent thick, cold oil at startup pushing
through the cooler and possibly bursting it. It is not vital, but most
folks I know with aux coolers won't run without one. It's alot cheaper
than a new engine.

Oil lines, everyone has their prefernces. SS braided lines, Rubber,
Steel, Aluminum, Copper. Everyone has their own bias. SS braid is the
big ticket racer stuff, and rubber is at the other end of the price
range. The best recomendation is determine what you can afford, and what
you're willing to go through to install it. Steel, aluminum, and copper
are all hard lines and can be difficult to install in tight places. SS
braid and rubber lines are flexible and can be routed much more easilly.

So there you have a run down on what you _can_ do. What is a good
source? The used cooler would be fine used as long as you make sure that
it doesn't leak and that it has been cleaned and checked out before you
buy it. As far as other equipment, the sandwich adapter you _may_ be
able to find at some VW shop that deals in Type IV motors, but I
honestly don't know. Try checking out Hot VWs magazine. When it came
down to making the choice, I checked out as many shops and such that I
could find. I checked Automotion, Auto Atlanta, Performance, to name a
few. What it came down to was what did the job best and forget the cost,
my enigne would cost alot more to rebuild if a cheap component failed at
an inoportune time. The differences in price were minimal, but they were
all on the slightly expensive side. My final pick was from a shop that
had some nice goodies that I hadn't seen from the other suppliers.
Namely a sandwich adapter/thermostat combination unit. It took up less
space and cost about the same as the two would have been together. I'd
say look around and shop for yourself, you'll get a feel for the prices
and such. 

What did _I_ wind up installing? A 25-row cooler, lid mounted with SS
braided aeroquip lines. I can't cut sheet metal in the class I compete
in, so the engine lid was my only good choice. I also installed an
11-blade electric radiator fan out of a ferrari behind the cooler to
provide extra cooling. Snap the fan on and the oil temperature drops 30
degrees.

I hope this helps, and I hope I didn't bore you either.
