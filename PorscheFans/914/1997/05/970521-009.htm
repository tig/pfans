>You know, I have a feeling that we would actually be less addicted to 914s if

>I was driving home during lunch to pick something up, and noticed puffs of
>white smoke from the exhaust.  Adjusting the fuel mixture did nothing, so my
>only guess was that I hadn't properly adjusted the valves the day before.
>So, I decided that I would quickly run a compression test to see if one of
>them was remaining open all of the time.  Sure enough, #2 was only
>registering 40 psi.  The others appeared a little low as well, so I
>re-checked them all, and when I got back to #2, it was down to 0 psi.  I
>popped the valve cover off and attempted to check the valves, but #2 wasn't
>at TDC, and I was running out of time.  I decided to start it and see.  When
>the car fired up, I was greeted with a horrendous banging noise that still
>traumatizes me to this day.  This time, the valve train came to a stop at TDC
>for #2, and it was quite obvious that the intake valve was adjusted way, way
>to tight.  As I started backing it off, however, I found that I had free-play
>in the rocker, and the valve was still open!  I dropped my valve seat in
>September, and today will be the first day that I actually get to try and
>start the car.
>
>See?  If none of this stuff happened, we'd have nothing to fix, and nothing
>to talk about.  This list would be pretty boring if we were all posting
>messages stating: "Day 1025:  Still running fine."
