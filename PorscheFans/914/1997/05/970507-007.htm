My local (national SCCA champion) guru set mine at zero toe in front, 1/16" 
toe in in the rear, as much front and rear camber as my chassis allows (if not 
equal left to right, set the greater to whatever the lesser is - for balance), 
and stock caster.  This combo is excellent on the street (not darty, for 
instance) and evens out your tire wear as well since going straight down the 
road wears the insides of the tires, and autocrossing wears the outsides 
faster.  Rear bars are usually only recommended for use with a limited slip 
differential (because the LSD increases "push" so much).

IMHO (assuming your engine is APrep legal), you may have too much tire for 
autocrossing (increased rolling resistance, increased unsprung weight, less 
aggressive effective gear ratio).  My 205-50 A008RSII's give all the bite I 
need and I hear the Hoosier radials of the same size are the current "best 
practice."

Can you tell if the faster cars are beating you (a) in the corners or (b) in 
acceleration?  Does anything "feel" wrong (e.g., transitions take too long, 
too much understeer/oversteer)?  What's the hardest part of the course for you 
to "ace" - the launch, braking, big sweepers, tight corners, slaloms, 
remembering where to go next?  Answers to such questions may make specific 
recommendations possible.

Also, I've benefitted from trend analysis; divide your class winner's time (or 
the top time of the day if you win frequently) by your best run time and make 
a trend chart out of those percentages for the whole season.  If you can keep 
up with the best (same percentage across events), you're both probably getting 
better; if you close the gap (get closer to 100% of his efficiency), you're 
getter better faster than he is; if the gap widens, you're stuck on some car 
or driving issue.

Keep the faith,

Subject: 	alignment settings?

hello all, I have a '70 modified 2.0 street/autox 914. I'm doing o.k. in
my class (AP) in local scca autox's but I think I need to tune my
suspension to be more competitive. I currently have rear koni's w/ 140#
springs on adjustable perches, front bilsteins w/ stock torsion bars,
factory fr and r sway bars and 225/50/15 R1's all the way around. I'm
wondering about camber and caster settings. What is best for autox but
still streetable? I've heard to go with maximum caster in the front ie:
5-7 deg and 1-2 deg of neg camber. What about the rear and also the toe
on both. All suggestions are much appreciated. I've already been told
many times to unhook my rear bar which I'm going to do next race. TIA,
Mark
