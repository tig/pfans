Hi all,

I've been on the lookout for 7x15" autoX wheels for a while now, and have
just contacted Steve Francis, in reply to his Minilite wheel ad.  I thought
I'd post this to the list, for general interest.  I've edited the email
replies somewhat--they were *long* and there was more than one email.

cheers, Brian
