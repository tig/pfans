Hi all,

Well looking at my calendar Stoddard's swap meet is a 2 weekends away. 
And since I don't really want to truck all this stuff up there I thought
I would offer it to you all at swap meet prices.

I have quite a list of stuff so drop me a note of what you are looking
for and I will get back to you with condition and price.  Buyer pays
shipping, we can work something out on the prices.

Just a sample.

914 side shifter trannies I have 2 for sale, condition unknown $175 each.

914 tail shifter trannies I have 3 for sale, condition unknown. $100
each.

Not I have a bunch piles of shifter rods and mechanisms for the above. 
If you want to convert to a side shifter I have all the parts you will
need including cross bar for the engine and linkage to the tranny from
gear shifter on back $100.  You will need the special bushing at the fire
wall and a gear shift knob to complete the conversion.

I have a center mount Weber carb and fuel pump, Bosch 009, fuel pressure
regulator and K&N air filter for $100

May have a couple of odd ball alloys around Fuchs or Mahles, will not
know until Sunday.

1 1.7L core engine runs btu don't know how well, long block.  EFI was a
cobbled mess, but it did run, less than a month ago. $100.  I am glad I
pulled this car off the road, man I probally saved the poor sole's life. 
The driver set was adjustable, you just picked it up and moved it where
ever you wanted it.  This was the rustiest 914 I have ever seen.  Floor,
what floor, rockers what are they fenders hoods and doors who needs them,
they just add weight!  The iron termites ate this one good, but what
scares me is some was driving this thing, until the clutch cable broke,
or the clutch tube failed.  Windshield still had a sticker for a Porsche
Parade a long time ago.

Have a couple of 2.0L heads off a 76 and other 2.0l parts a may part
with.

Very nice 74 rear bumper $80, extremely clean.  Also have a nice painted
steel front bumper for $80, very clean.

Fenders $100 clean, hoods $75, deck lids $75, targa tops, useable $20.  I
use one as and engine board.  Set the engine on it slide it into the van,
if the engine should leak anything the top catches it.

I have brake parts, in useable condition, cheap!!! All are well within
factory specs, just remember please rotors do rust when not used.

Many hard parts, tons of gauges, not a large supply of interior items,
but do have switches, original radios, dashboards, and misc. items.

I just don't want to haul all the rest of my stuff up to Stoddards to
stand there all day and try to sell this stuff.

Oh I have a bunch of 1.7 and 1.8 injector parts, and misc. engine hard
parts.

Need anything drop me a note.  Yes I will still be attending the Stoddard
swap meet, but as a buyer, and hopefully not a seller.  Hope to see some
of you there!

Take care,
Stephen Jacobs
