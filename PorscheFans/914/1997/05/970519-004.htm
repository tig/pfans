Hey everyone,

First thank you for all the help on  me conversion questions. Now the 911
struts are in up front and discs and calipers. I am half way to finishing
the suspension. The car looks wierd with fuchs up front a bilstiens in the
back :). Its my only car so thats all I could do this weekend. Next week
the rear gets upgraded. Yeah!!

So now a question that relates about the four cylinder. It is a 73 2.0 with
stock FI.  I set the idle speed at just under 1000rpms on the tach in the
drive way. Everythings great. Well I get caught in a traffic jam and the
idle sits at 1000 for about 3min and then it starts to slow down until the
engine shuts off. No matter how high I set the idle the engine will idle at
the speed and then slow down until it stalls. Seems to me like some thing
is loosing its vaccume at idle speeds. Is this a sign of a bad manifolld
pressure sensor? Also The car has started to back fire if I red line it and
let the engine fall back down to idle. You clean the plugs in first after
the traffic jam :) 

Nick
