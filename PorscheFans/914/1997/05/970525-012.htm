Now some people may disagree with me here, but I found that using just a
light film of silly-cone to hold the cork gasket to the valve cover
allows it to stay in place while being installed. And will also help it
resist shifting as the vacuum under the cover gets higher as the rpms go
up. The cover of course has to be clean first.

There's a bunch of different makes out there, so it all depends. Some of
them, I believe have an extra lip on the inside to hold the gasket in
place better, but as for sealing? I doubt a valve cover makes much of a
difference. For cooling, yes (debatable). For cosmetics, yes. But I
don't think it makes much of a difference for sealing. Be forwarned
though, the aluminum finned covers to not fit as well as the stock ones
in the 914 engine bay. And sheet metal, I believe, has to be modified.
