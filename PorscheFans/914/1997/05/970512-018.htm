I've received a ton of good tips on the initial break in process, thank
you all.  The only new stuff in my motor, however, is the rebuilt heads,
freshly honed cylinders, and new rings.  I plan on cranking with no fuel
or spark until I get pressure, and then *hopefully* starting it.  I
think I'll use a non-synthetic 30w oil... do I really need to change the
oil 3 times in the first 300 miles?  I heard this was to get all of the
assembly lube out, so maybe I'm missing something here.  The only
pre-lubing I did was a little on the wrist pin, in the piston where the
wrist pin slides in, and on the rod bearing where the pin slides
through, and I only used motor oil.  Have I screwed up again?  The motor
seems to turn over by hand just fine.  Also, is it possible that I could
do more harm than good with the 20 min. 2500 rpm thing since it's not a
new cam?
