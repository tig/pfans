Since I first posted a note here (about 3 weeks or so ago) about the
horizontle electric fan kit for the 914-4, many questions have been sent my
way.  I am probably as interrested/curious in its adaptability to street cars
and racers as any of you list members are.  Don Ramsey at ACR (Air Cooled
Racing, 423-671-4914) has built this system for several of his racing
customers and is successfully using it in the Knoxville, TN area.  He sells
the kit for $500.00 in glass and I believe it can be done in carbon fiber
also for an additional charge.
For those interrested, I have sent Richard Ellis
(http://www.dallas.net/rare/porschefans.html) several shots of this setup as
well as Allan McMichael (http://www.why.net/users/a914drvr/) to post on their
respective pages.  I would expect the posting setup to take a couple days, so
try looking at these sites early next week.  I am very interrested in
everones feedback.  
I plan on purchasing the ACR electric fan kit for my GT3 914 and have gotten
a oil cooler adapter/block-off plate from Kerry Hunter to help complete the
setup.  Kerry (khunter@baervan.nmt.edu) has produced a very nice CNC milled
piece at a very reasonable price.  He also sells headers for street/track
914-4s that are widely used in the PCA and SCCA  circles.
Discussions are underway at our local Skunk-Works (H&H Enterprises) about the
kits adaptability for street cars.  We've been through about three pots of
coffee, 11 Sprites and a pound and a half of jerkey at this point in the
discussion.  The overall consensis is we think it can be done with some
additional pieces and of coarse an external oil cooler.
Stay tuned...........

Have a safe MD weekend........Rich
