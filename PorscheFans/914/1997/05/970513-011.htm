The rear calipers tend not to leak unless you split them; but I found
that my calipers benefited substantially from a complete teardown,
cleaning, and replacement of the O-rings. The major benefit was in
smoother operation of the parking mechanism. I had to split the
calipers to get the last vestiges of rust out of the bores.

On the downside, it takes several thousand brake applications for the
O-rings to stabilize [they tend to absorb fluid under pressure when new] so
prepare to have a 'spongy' brake pedal for 4-6 months while they break in.
I was given this tidbit by a certified P mechanic, who said that its
a 'common complaint after rebuilding brakes' -- and that bleeding doesn't
resolve the issue.

I bead blasted mine [except the mating surfaces and bores, of course]
and then covered them with a coat of 'rust preventitive latex' paint
sold at target. i forget the brand, but it was one of the major lines of
paint [not krylon, not rust-ole, but a competing brand]. 

the latex based compund has proved surprisingly resistant to brake
fluid. none of the coatings has broken from fluid dissolution, although
there are some bare spots from grit abrasion -- its not as tough a coating
as epoxy.

i did it with a brush, which came out just fine, mostly due to the grainy
casting surface. I also have an epoxy coated caliper set, and the 
difference in finish isn't all the great. The cost differential is pretty
high, with epoxy coating running $50-100.

The  difficult part of epoxy brake coating is sealing the parts you don't
want coated. Once its on, it ain't coming off. I've used 'refrigerator
epoxy' in the can, and its not nearly as tough a coating as the baked on
stuff. I suppose you could bake your own, though.

The coil spring is easily removed once you unscrew the pistons, which is
done be removing the lock nuts and rotating the screws clockwise, if memory
serves correctly. Its easy to tell; as you turn the screw, the piston
comes out of the bore. Once the piston is out, the spring is unloaded.
