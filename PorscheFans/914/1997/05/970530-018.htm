This brings up an interesting issue.  My car has stock sways 
front and rear and has been significantly lowered.  I don't have
a spring compressor so I set it up to get a little rake based 
upon where the rear bilsteins are set now. (Not to mention that
the thought of compressing the springs and adjusting the perches
at the rear terrifies me; don't want a head/hand taken off).

In any case, with the front now so low, I don't think it is 
possible for me to connect the front sway bar without preload
as the drop links are not adjustable.  Is there a source for
adjustable links separate from the bar?  Or will I be forced to
purchase and install an aftermarket bar with adjustable droplinks?

Regards,
