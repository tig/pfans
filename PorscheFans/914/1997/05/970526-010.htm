As you probably know, I've been debating the 13" wheel situation for a
while now. And had come to lamentable conclusion a while back that it
wouldn't work. I was wrong! I borrowed a fellow CSPers wheel today to
see if it would fit over my brakes. And sure enough, it did! BARELY.
Maybe 0.1 inch to spare, but it cleared. The problem area is at the
bottom of the ball joint at the end of the A-arm. However, I think this
can be considered part of the strut, and struts are open in SP. So, I'm
going to do a little poking around and see how much the bottom of that
joint can be trimmed. It doesn't interfere by much, but it's enough
right now.

Josh,
I suspect a protest committee would view the ball joint as being =
something other than part of the strut.  Even bump stops and bushings at =
the top of the strut are not considered part of the strut, and I think =
there's a better case to be made for them.  I don't know what kind of =
wheel you tried, but there are probably others that will fit without any =
mods to the ball joint.
