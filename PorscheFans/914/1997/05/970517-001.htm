Greetings 914-er's!

   This may be of general interest, so I am posting it to the list, but it is mainly a question for Josh...

   I may be reading too much into what you say here, but it sounds as though you meant to imply 
(please correct me if I'm wrong) that you are recommending using a wrench on the square nut behind 
the alternator "ear", the one that the belt adjustment socket-head bolt screws into.
   If so, I should point out that I have my engine out of the car as I write this, and just recently finished 
installing the alternator in preparation for putting the engine back in.   I remember this nut pretty well, 
and it has two projections on it that ride in the slot cut in the belt adjustment bracket, to prevent it from 
turning when the socket-head bolt is tightened or loosened.  I don't see how one can turn this nut with 
a wrench without breaking something.

   Just a caution, and if that's not what you meant, please disregard.

                                                  Best Wishes,
                                                  Jim T.
