I was reading one of the latest(VIII?) volumes of the up-fix'n series,
otherwise known as the Journal of Porsche Obsession, last night and came
across a really elegant solution for measuring bearing wear without
tearing down the engine. The tools required are not far beyond what we
normally encounter during Porsche maintenance.  

In tracking down a persistant bearing failure above 10,000 rpm (!)  in
the Porsche Indy motor, the mechanics sent their suspect bearing out to
a "nuclear reactor" to be irradiated. The radioactive bearing was duly
installed and the engine run in.  Here's the neat part. They then
charted the radioactivity of the oil after various constant speeds
aproaching and beyond 10,000 rpm for a trick chart of bearing wear vs.
rpm.

Neat, huh!  Finally, something truly useful (meaning related to
Porsches) from the nuclear program. And it's factory approved.

I see this as a great way to keep track of valve-guide wear or maybe the
bottom-end bearings. And just think of all the other benefits, like
being able to display those neat bright black and yellow radioactive
stickers in the parking lot to keep other cars at a safe distance.

Dave, can you help us out here?
