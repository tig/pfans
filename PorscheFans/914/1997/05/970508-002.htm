The amount of friction generated between to surfaces is a function of the
coefficient of friction, mu, and the normal force only. In this case the
reaction force between the tire and the road for the car with the wide
tires and the one with the narrow tires (with the same mu, or tire
compound), is the same. I think the only advantage of wider tires/wheels
is in going around corners because the track of the car is widened, thus
increasing the roll (or tipping) resistance of the car, and the shape of
the contact patch is changed to be more lateral to the forward movement of
the car, thus increasing the wheel's resistance to tipping. Skinny wheels
and tires are good for drag racing becuase they have a contact patch that
enhances straight ahead stability (think of skinny winter snow tires). 

The only way to increase the friction between the tire and 
the road is to change the coefficient of friction (the tire compound), 
and/or change the weight (or wieght distribution) of the car.
