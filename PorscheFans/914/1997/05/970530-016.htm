There are two things that are done with this. Corner weighting, where
the idea is to get each coner of the car equally weighted. But this can
only usually be done by moving things around and changing the balast of
the car due to its 5% rearward weight bias. The other is what is most
commanly done to autoxing 914s, and that is balncing the cross weights.
The cross weights are the total of the opposite corner weights. The
front right and rear left should combine to weight the same as the front
left and right rear. Cross weighting the car will ensure that the car
will respond the same in a right or left transition and the amount of
weight transfered (not the total weight of either side) will be roughly
equal. This needs to be done with the equivilent of the drivers weight
in the car. It is an entirely unecessary procedure for a purely street
driven car. You need a special scale to do the measurements. Four pads,
one under each wheel and all four of the level with each other.

In order to increase the weight at a specific corner, raise it. Raising
the corner will pull up the car and take on more of the total weight of
the car. This will also act to reduce weight elsewhere. Corner or cross
balancing a 914 without adjustbale spring perches is pretty difficult to
do.
