DD has lot's of experience with that one, so I'll leave that to him...

But congratulations on getting back out on the road!

Because: A) they're professional racers and have money to burn. And B)
Don't really care how long the engine lasts as long as it gets 'em
accross the finish line. We as ameture racers and shadetree mechanics
would like our engines to last as long as possible and as such we want
to make sure the break in of the engine is done carefully. Also, pro
racers build those engines with the full knowledge that it _will_ be
torn down between races and as such they build the engine with that in
mind. Very expensive materials and different tollerances go into a
pro-race motor that is going to torn down after the day is done than a
motor that _we_ all want to last 200k miles.
