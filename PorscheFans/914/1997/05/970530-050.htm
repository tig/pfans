    Not exactly, Jeffrey... The stock setup only means that the
    front is all we'll be able to ADJUST.

    This may not work very well, since the car's center of gravity
    isn't located precisely along its longitudinal axis. 

    A better way would be to weigh ALL FOUR corners, then figure out
    what front-wheel weights are necessary in order to achieve equal
    DIAGONAL weight sums... Getting the diagonal sums (or "cross
    weights") equal is what makes the car handle predictably;
    getting the front left-to-right weights equal ONLY helps if the
    car's center of gravity is right at the lateral center of the
    front track.

    An example is probably called for at this point, so...

    Imagine that you weigh all four wheels and get this result
    (switching to a monospaced font at this point would be a good
    idea):

            _  Front  _
       300 |_|-------|_| 600
                 |
                 |
                 |
            _    |    _
       900 |_|-------|_| 200
                Rear 

    Note that 45% of the car's weight is on the front wheels and 55%
    is on the rear.  Also (and more importantly for this discussion),
    60% of the car's weight is on the left wheels and 40% is on the
    right.

    This is a completely hypothetical example, by the way.

    Unless you physically move the car's components around (by moving
    the battery from the engine compartment to the front trunk, for
    instance), this 45-front/55-rear, 60-left/40-right relationship
    WILL NOT CHANGE, no matter WHAT you do (within reason) to the
    ride height.

    Remember that; it's VERY important.

    Ok... Now let's say that you adjust the front-left and -right
    ride heights to make their weights equal:

            _  Front  _
       450 |_|-------|_| 450
                 |
                 |
                 |
            _    |    _
       750 |_|-------|_| 350
                Rear 

    Note that when you jack weight onto a wheel, the wheel at the
    diagonally-opposite corner gains the same amount of weight, and
    each of the other two corners LOSES that amount of weight.

    Of course, this won't be true if your 914's floorpan is all
    rusted out; in that case, all that happens is that the chassis
    twists and sags whenever you change ride height.  But I digress.

    Ok... Now look at the cross-weights.

    Originally, they were:

        Front Right + Left Rear = 600 + 900 = 1500
        Front Left + Right Rear = 300 + 200 =  500

        Ratio = 1500/500 = 3

    After the front weights were "balanced", the cross-weights are:

        Front Right + Left Rear = 450 + 750 = 1200
        Front Left + Right Rear = 450 + 350 =  800

        Ratio = 1200/800 = 1.5

    This is CLOSER to the ideal 1/1 ratio we're looking for, but it
    still isn't right... If you keep adding weight to the front-left
    wheel (or removing it from the front-right), you can get to the
    following arrangement, which DOES have the correct 1/1 ratio of
    cross-weights:

            _  Front  _
       550 |_|-------|_| 350
                 |
                 |
                 |
            _    |    _
       650 |_|-------|_| 450
                Rear 

    The cross weights are now:

        Front Right + Left Rear = 350 + 650 = 1000
        Front Left + Right Rear = 550 + 450 = 1000

        Ratio = 1000/1000 = 1

    Of course, the front-to-rear weight ratio is still 45/55, and
    the left-to-right ratio is still 60/40.

    One last thing:

    If your front bumper was more-or-less level originally, it'll be
    WAY crooked after you've made the change... That's why people
    generally don't try to corner-balance cars that don't have
    adjustable ride-height at all four corners.  With four-corner
    adjustability, you can start by making the car level, then
    balance it by ALWAYS lowering/raising diagonally-opposite
    corners SIMULTANEOUSLY... The result is a car that's both
    cross-weight-balanced AND level.
