Greetings, 914-er's!

  I seem to remember a test posted somewhere about how to determine if one had a weak chassis.  
Something about getting a heavy guy to sit in the car with the top off, and check for door closure, or 
something like that.  I fear that this procedure dissapeared with so much other good stuff when Tim 
had his upgrade problems.
  
  At any rate, I need a general idea of how much a 914 should bend.  My trouble is represented by 
the fact that my driver's side window glass hangs up on the new replacement rubber that I got from 
Doc & Cy's which mounts on the front edge of the roll bar.  I started to wonder if the chassis was 
getting weak, so I put my foot on the pontoon about even with the driver's seat back and put some 
weight on it.  The roll bar was seen to move with respect to the targa top slightly: between 1/16" and 
1/8".  However, the movement does not progress with increasing weight; even when I bounce up and 
down on one foot, the movement seems limited to that initial bit.  Additionally, the top is not jammed; it 
is free to rattle up and down a bit with full weight (about 220 pounds) applied.  The door opens and 
closes easily either with or without weight in the driver's seat, as long as the window is rolled down.  
The window hangs up on the rubber when rolled up more than halfway, with or without the driver's 
weight in the car, although it seems to be worse with the weight applied.

  There seems to be only slight surface rust around the jack point on the driver's side.  I have 
repeatedly jacked the car on both jack points with no observed problems... they seem quite sturdy.  I 
have had the outer rocker panel off on the right side, and found only slight surface rust here and 
there... no obvious structural problems.  The floor pan is in excellent shape.  There is virtually no rust 
on the outside; however there is some rust in the center tunnel on the inside.  I have yet to remove the 
driver's side outer rocker panel, however.  There is no observable rust in the area of the pontoons 
inside the rear wheel wells forward of the wheels, but the original undercoat and dirt prevents close 
inspection... there are no obvious gaps, holes, or other problems.
  
  Sooo.... how much is too much?  And how do you measure it?  And where are the weak spots, and 
what can one do about them?

  Additionally, I have a slight bit of negative camber, more pronounced on the right side.  However, I 
have done extensive rust repair on the under-the-battery-tray rust problem, and while I found the 
engine shelf needed replacing, the chassis member under it and the suspension console appeared 
to be in fine shape.
  How obvious is suspension console weakness / failure?  Is it subtle with internal cracking or 
something, or is it obvious when it fails?

  Any input would be appreciated. 

                                                  Thanks in Advance,
                                                  Jim T.
