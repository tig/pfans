Just thought I'd chime in too.  I changed my rear (original) springs to
140# Weltmeisters and replaced the worn shocks with Billstiens at the
same time.  I was worried the ride would be a lot harsher because this
is my everyday driver and goes long trips with me.  I was pleasantly
surprised to discover that the ride actually seems smoother with the new
setup.  I think it is because the old springs were bottoming out on bad
bumps and the shocks were shot.  I would not have any problem
recommending 140s to any street drivers.  100# should be fine also
(especially if you've got a rear sway bar), just depends on what you
want to use the car for, but I don't think you'll notice much difference
between the two.

What NOT to do if you want a smooth, comfy street ride:  Do NOT put
Weltmeister poly-graphite plastic bushings on your front suspension!
These are great on the track and made an unbelievable difference in
responsiveness, but they'll jar your eyes outta there sockets on RR
tracks or washboard roads.
