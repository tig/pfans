Well I picked up my 914 yesterday evening.  I'd dropped it off with George
Wright, Wright Machine last Friday.

George machined my 320i calipers $40.  I also had him remove the rear 4-5
lug adapters, pull the hubs, put my new rear bearings in and put in the 5
lug hubs I had.  He let me borrow the extra long socket he had tuned down
the end on that he needed to remove the rear adapters so i can do my fronts
Also had him do something he came up with. Replace the roll pins in the
rear CV/stub axle joint with hardened steel pins. Now I'll be able to
remove the half shafts without pulling the stub axle to separate them.   He
had it all done by Sunday, I just had a chance to get a ride the 80 miles
from my house to him Thursday.

I'd recommend him if you need the 320i calipers machined.  I also picked up
his new $100 proportioning valve setup, Glenn had sent an email to the list
about these a few weeks ago.  This has the adjustable Wilwood valve from
Summit along with a custom made bracket and all the connectors to make it a
bolt in replacement.  I saw the one George has on his project car.  Ended
up talking with him for over 2 hours before I left. He pointed out several
things that my project car needs.  He'd also found several bolts missing,
etc. that he'd replaced for me.  And more screwy stuff curtesy of the PO
and his 'engine rebuild' guy.  I've got to tear this engine down and check
it myself at some point, just too much about the rebuild I don't like.

Leaving after dark was interesting, discovered a new electrical glitch that
I'm sending  as a question in another email.

Jeff
