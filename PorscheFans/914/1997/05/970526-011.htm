Yeah, but bump stops and bushings are both unrestricted as well. True, I
think it's a stretch to consider the ball-joint to be part of the strut.
But it's a really tight squeeze the way it is. Just an 1/8" or less is
all I need to clear. Ideally I need a wheel with a 13" I.D., so if
there's one out there, I'd be tickled pink. But I think the absolute
minimum would be 12.75" I.D.. Still, that would leave little or no room
for the brakes. But this is autox, who needs brake cooling for a 70
second run? It'll have plenty of time in grid to cool off. 

If I could get measurements of both the early and late style ball
joints, maybe there's enough of a difference that one would work better
for clearance. Anyone out there care to comment on the merits of either
early or late ball-joints? Or any problems that may associated with one
or the other? After all the update/backdate rule can allow all sorts of
things. Substitution of early metal parts with later plastic parts could
save a couple pounds here and there.

I tried a 13X8 3-piece DuraLight wheel. My interest in them is that the
inner surface is flat all the way up to the face plate of the wheel,
that way they clear the brake caliper. And 5" backspacing for such a
smal wheel is neccessary. 5 1/2" is too much, it'll hit the tie rod. And
it'll need at least an extra 1/4" positive offset from the mating
surface to allow room for the caliper. But I think it can be done.
