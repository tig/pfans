Ack!  I can't seem to figure this out.  O.K., I've removed the vacuum
advance mechanism, and sucking (fairly hard) on either of the tubes
results in the arm being drawn in.  There is a fair amount of grit
sandwiched between the plate that this arm moves, so when connected the
movement isn't as great.  I cannot figure out how the Crane cams
mechanism works.  There's a small plastic circle with four cuts in it at
90 degree intervals.  This circle apparently slides down onto the shaft
with the optical sensor, and in order to remove either, they both have
to come off.  The thing I'm afraid of it putting it back together.
Should I just attempt to mark its current location, or is there some
logic to its position?  Once I get that out, I think I can clean the top
of the plate O.K.  Now, here's the really hard part.  On the bottom of
the distributor is a plate (FI points?) where the three wires to the
computer hook up.  Its held in with two screws, and the Haynes manual
implies that once these screws are removed, the plate will just slide
out.  I'd beg to differ.  It slides out about 1/4 in., but won't budge
after that.  I've tried jiggling back and forth, but it just won't move.
Can someone please tell me how to proceed from here?

Again, any help would be greatly appreciated!
