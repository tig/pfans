Howdy 914er's and Club members, 

 For those of you who couldnt attend or didnt know about it, this past
weekend was the Sixth Annual West Coast Renegade Festival (may
16th-18th,97) in Solvang, Ca.

 It is now just a memory now, but what a GREAT memory it is !!
 This was my first 914 club get together and I had the best time ever, 3
days of 914's!! I got to meet many of the list and club members, to many
to list or remember but I must name a few, Rich Johnson , Dave shepard ,
Perry kiehl, Glenn Stazak, Barbara and Alex, Monica Rohar & Roy Juan,
Dean Vanni and wife, Mike Hagen, Gudmond (from denmark) and many more
that I just cant remember (Sorry).
 We Arrived on Friday afternoon, checked in and just kinda hung out with
the group and talk and checked out all the cars,I believe there where 6
914-6's and 20 914's total in attendence. Just to name a few car that I
wont soon forget. Dave shepard's (GPR) brought his Silver 914 GT, 993
wheeled and mirrored 2.4   (4 cyl) with an NOS system ! Cool car! Mike
Hagen's Original Factory race car 914-6GT #40, Way Cool !,I think I used
a hole roll of film on this one,a very nice unmolested racer. Monica
Rohar's Concours winning '75,clean was an understatement!!, Roy Juan's
Beautiful GT Flared 6 conversion, was as Fast as it looked. Dean Vanni,
with his Very nice 73, was saddly for sale, this car will make someone
very happy! John (cant remember his last name) with his very pretty
Cobalt blue 914-6 with Burlwood interrior. And the list goes on and on.
 Saturday we all went down to a local park in the hills and down a fun
little mountain road, that a few member had there way   with : ) had a
nice little car show and judging and then it was picnic time. that night
we had a Good dinner at one of the local Solvang eaterys and then closed
the bar.
 Sunday was a rally and lunch before heading home.
All I can say (if you can read my spelling) IS if you have a chance to
attend a 914 get together is GO !!!! It was great to put a face to the
email address and I fell like I have a second family now.
 Maybe someone else that attended can fill in on my ramblings!
 Thanks to all who made it happen and it was Great to meet you guys,
wish we all lived closer together.
Thanks again Rich, Roy, Dean, Godmund, Glenn, Perry, Dave.
Take care and happy motoring........

 Don
