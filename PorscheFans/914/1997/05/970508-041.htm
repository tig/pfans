If you really have too much understeer, unhooking the rear bar or adding
a stiffer front bar will only make the problem worse. Now, I've never
driven your car with it's setup, but I'd be willing to say that the
reason you're pushing in the tight 180s and not in higher speed slaloms
is that you're going in the tight turns too hot. There is an important
lesson that is somtimes neglected in autoxing, there are times where
slower is faster. Try entering the turn slower than you normally do, and
power your way all the way through. You'll find your exit speeds much
higher and your times will come down accordingly. MOST ANY car will push
if you dive into a turn too hot. Even F1.
