>... my calculations look something like this:  94mm bore X 71mm stroke =
>493cc swept volume, add cyl head vol = 52cc, add dish vol = 5cc, add
>gskt vol = 5cc, add deck clearance = 9cc, = 564cc total vol @bdc, 71cc
>@tdc for CR = 564/71= 7.95 or leave out the gskt  for 559/66= 8.47 CR;

>	O.K., my turn.  I calculate swept volume at 492.724cc [(94/2)^2*3.14159*71],
>and have been told to simply forget about cc'ing my heads, since they'll
>probably fall between 61cc and 63cc.  I measured my deck height (from top of
>piston to top of cylinder) at .017in with a .010in gasket under the cylinder,
>but have since been told that I must have screwed up because it should be
>between .030in and .040in.  I can't, however, see how I could error in that
>direction.  Has anyone else measured deck height with Euro pistons and a
>.010in gasket?  I'm told my Euro pistons should be between 2cc and 4cc.  I'm
>still debating whether or not I should run with a head gasket, but if I do,
>it'll be .030in, and if I don't, I'll increase the base gasket size from
>.010in to .030in.  So here are my volumes:

>Swept: 492.724cc
>Top of piston to top of cylinder: 2.99cc - 6.52cc (.010in - .030in base
>gasket)
>Head Gasket: 0 - 5.3cc (none - .030in head gasket)
>Piston Dish: 2 - 4cc
>Combustion Chamber: 61cc - 63cc
>
>So, if I calculate based on the lowest volumes possible, I get a CR of 8.09 :
>1, and if I do the opposite, then I get 7.54 : 1.  Both of these seem a
>little low.  The weird part is that I'm being told that my deck height is
>abnormally low.  If my deck height should be .030in - .040in, this will drop
>my possible CRs even lower!  Is there a factory spec on deck height?  
>	The thing is that I'm not trying to turn this into a high CR motor.  This is
>my daily driver, so I want as much reliable power as possible.  Sure, I'm
>going to try to race it, but it's not a solitary racecar.  If 8.5 : 1 can be
>had reliably, then great.  I would like to be around 8.0 : 1, but if I'm
>stuck at 7.6 : 1, so be it.  My biggest concern is the deck height.  I've
>heard so many different things now I don't know what to do.  On one end, I've
>got MSHP telling me to put a .020 base gasket in and run without a head
>gasket.  This will give me a deck height of .027in.  On the other end, I've
>had suggestions to run a .030 base gasket and a .030 head gasket.  This means
>a deck height of .067.  This is the difference between 8.27 : 1 and 7.25 : 1,
>a full compression point!  Ultimately, I just want as much power as I can get
>out of the motor with a properly maintained life expectancy of about 100,000
>miles.  If the factory specs are right (and if I can assume some direct
>proportionality), than .4 compression points results in about 5 hp.  7.25 : 1
>would put me around 90hp, but 8.27 : 1 would jump me up around 105, which not
>only sounds better, but doesn't sound like something that will destroy my
>motor in 30,000 miles.  I know I've essentially gone through all of this
>before, but can anyone offer anymore help?
