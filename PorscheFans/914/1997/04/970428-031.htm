Granted Type I P&C's are cheaper than the machine work on the old 
cylinders. But, we're dealing with the 914, 600$ worth of P&C's buys a 
fair amount of machine work. So, what's the deal? If the motorcycle 
people do this all the time, then why can't we?? Surely our engines don't 
run any hotter than thiers, and they make much more hp per cc than we do. 
I just don't get it.....
