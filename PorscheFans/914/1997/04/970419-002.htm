Hi to J.J. and the other Porsche 914 Fans who who have put up with my ramblings so far... I got asked 
a couple of questions, so I will try to reply, and try to be less verbose this time!

  J.J.'s first question / comment:

> The impression that I'm getting is that placement of the shims doesn't
> affect deck height, but it does affect performance.

   Nice theory; mechanical impossibility.  Look at it this way... the distance from the crankcase to the 
head is the sum of all the shims and gaskets, plus the length of the cylinder (seating ledge to seating 
ledge).  Where you put the shims and gaskets does not change the distance from the crankcase to 
the head one iota; addition is commutative.   The position of the stroke (that is, the point in the 
cylinder bore where the piston stops on both ends of it's stroke) changes, but that's all.  To change 
the deck height,  you must add or remove shims / gaskets, which changes the magnitude of the 
distance between the head and the crankcase, and thus, the distance between where the piston 
stops and the HEAD...  for small changes (under .1") the position of the swept volume in the cylinder 
is irrelevant.  The distance from the crankcase (centerline of the crank, to be exact) to the deck 
portion of the head is what we are trying to adjust.  This will affect performance; how we get this 
change is, as I said, irrelevant.

J.J. continues:

> correctly) used head gaskets, only the 914.  Bill at Mark Stephens said

  First, to dispense with 911's they have a "crush ring" which is crucial to proper engine operation; 
leave it out at your peril.
  Second,  permit me to quote from Tom Wilson's book, regarding assembling VW type IV heads to 
the engine:  "Place the metal sealing ring in the cylinder head recess, then slide the head down it's 
studs."
  Thirdly,  a quote from the Haynes book (pg 34, paragraph 7:  "When all four cylinders are in 
position, install the sealing rings into the cylinder heads and gently ease the heads over the studs."
  Forthly,  I ordered a replacement set of head gaskets / sealing rings (whatever you wish to call 
them) from GPR, and received them the next day... obviously an in-stock item.  This is highly unusual 
for a factory discontinued or repudiated part.
  Fifthly, my engine was fitted with sealing rings which I observed upon dissassembly, and there was 
no evidence of combustion leakage around these gaskets.
  My suggestion is to call a Porsche dealer and have him check his service buletins concerning 
sealing rings... if Porsche has repudiated this part, I will be extremely surprised.

  The final point is that omitting sealing rings is a quick and dirty way of raising compression, and 
hence performance, originated on hot-rod VW's.  It will accomplish the same thing on a 914, but the 
deck heights on a VW motor are lots greater than on a 914, so be careful!  More likely, be sorry...  
After what Jerry Brady (I think it was him; apologies otherwise) noted about piston growth with 
temperature, I wouldn't even consider running without head gaskets... as I wouldn't consider running 
non-sodium exhaust valves, regardless of what Mark Stephens, Inc. says.

  J.J. continues:

  I suppose that depends on your definition of sucess... winning races, or building reliable street 
motors?   High compression = high performance (the name of the company), but it also = high stress 
= short engine life.   Ask any automotive engineer how to increase engine life, and he'll tell you to 
de-tune it.

  J.J. continues:

  See above...  I reserve the title of liar to those about whom I can prove it, and in this case I cannot, 
but if this is correct, I will be astounded.

  This is exactly how it is advised to be done in Bill Fisher's book (also, he recommends dying the 
water), but I found by experimentation that I could get pretty close... the water does not seem to bulge 
to nearly the extent that I thought it would.  Also, I am not trying to squeeze out the last ounce of 
performance, so I rounded any errors in the direction that would result in higher compression, so that 
I would be sure to lower it enough with shims.  It apparently worked OK, because my calculated C/R 
came out to be 7.93 to 1... pretty close to the 8 to 1 advertised for Euro pistons.

  Lastly, concerning formulae:  Dave Darling is right as usual; I'll just reproduce his math below:

> Bore = 94mm; Stroke = 71mm.
> (94 / 2) ^2 * PI = 6939.77 mm^2 area of one piston
> 6939.77 * 71 / 1000 [mm^3/cc] = 492.72cc volume of one piston stroke
> 492.72 * 4 = 1970.89cc swept volume of four cylinders
> 

  I only need to add the formula for C/R:  C=Vt/Vf              Where:
                                                  Vt is total volume, or Vs + Vf
                                                  Vs is swept volume from volume
                                                  of a cylinder and bore and stroke 
                                                  (see Dave D.)
                                                  Vf is fixed volume; i.e. the total of:
                                                  Deck Height Volume (sum of measured
                                                  piston clearance and head gasket 
                                                  volume, if used)
                                                  Combustion Chamber Volume
                                                  Piston Dish Volume
                                                  Cylinder Shim Volume (if used)

  Anybody else want to get in on this?  I'd especially like to hear about experiences with those folks in 
Tehachipi... I ordered cylinder base shims from them and they looked up the bore of a 914 (94 mm) 
and sent me some shims with that I.D. ..... obviously for a VW... they wouldn't, of course, fit over the 
bottom of my cylinders, which are 100 mm in diameter... I hope they get this straightened out before 
my next day off, or I am going to be steamed...

                                                  Jim T.
