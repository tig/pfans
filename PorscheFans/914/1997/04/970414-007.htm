Hi  Philippe!

    To answer your question, I live in Lancaster, California, U.S.A.  This is in the high desert, slightly 
north and east of Los Angeles, if you're looking at a map.  The area's principal claim to fame is 
aerospace:  Chuck Yeager first flew faster than sound at what is now Edwards Air Force base, which 
is about 30 miles north and east of Lancaster, and the Space Shuttles were built in Palmdale, which 
is about 7 miles down the road to the south.

  Thank you for your comments on the articles.  I am glad that some find them useful.

  You might mention where it is that you live in Belgium... I can think of only two Belgian cities off the 
top of my head... Brussels, of course, and Liege (spelling?).  I only know of the latter because at one 
time I lived in Santa Barbara, California, and there was a Burroughs computer plant there which built 
several models in their mini-mainframe line, the B-1800 series.  Liege (spelling?) comes into the 
picture because the models of B-1800 computers that were not built in Santa Barbara were built 
there.   I used to have a couple of friends that worked at theBurroughs plant and they mentioned the 
Belgian plant from time to time.

  I am somewhat embarrased because I have not yet written to the type IV high performance shop 
that you told me about to get information on cylinder head temperatures.  I have not replied to you 
yet, because I do not have the data yet, but I have not forgotten.  Please be patient with me.

                                                  Regards,
                                                  Jim T.

  P.S.  Sorry about using up mailing list bandwidth, but my mail server bounced Phillipe's latest 
E-mail address.  Phillipe, if you get a chance, please be sure that the E-mail address that is 
contained in your header is correct.
                                                  Thanks,
                                                  Jim T.
