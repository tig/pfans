Yup. And there's lot's to do if you want to. First however, I need to
tell you the the 1.7 simply won't hack it in CSP. You may have the
weight advantage with the '72, but the power problem will bite you on
larger courses. My recomendation, build up the suspension on your 1.7
and learn to squeeze every tenth of a second out that you can.
Suspension is the key in street prepared. It doesn't matter how much
power you have, if you can't get it down to the ground it doesn't
matter. And I've seen the X1/9 kick butt in DSP and it is even more
underpowered than the 1.7. Suspension, suspension, suspension are all
key ingredients in CSP. But I have to emphasize the most important
factor here. SEAT TIME!! PRACTICE! PRACTICE! PRACTICE! All the
suspension tweaking and horsepower aren't worth beans if you don't have
the experience to make it work.

So along the lines of my suggestion. Stay with the '72 1.7 for now and
learn to drive it well. Go to autox schools, and ask for instruction at
regular events as well. Everyone has something they can still learn.
Sometimes it just takes a different perspective. When you feel that
you've reached the point that you need a better car, start looking for a
2.0. Then transplant all the go-fast goodies from the 1.7 to the 2.0.

Well ben, strat looking now and be very patient. CSP is an expensive
class, and is one of the most wrench-turningest classes in Solo II. I'd
say just plop a 2.0 in your 1.7 with lots of suspension tweaks, but
technically that isn't allowed in the update/backdate rules.

I guess the best thing is list what mods you _do_ have. Include any
mods, suspension, brakes, motor, body etc. And I can help give you an
idea of what you should look to do. Unless you have a hell of alot
ofeither time or money, the 914 will have difficulty at being a
nationally competetive car in CSP, but can still do quite well at the
local level. What region are you in?
