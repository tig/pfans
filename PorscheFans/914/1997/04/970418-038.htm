 Hey All, 

  I too have seen the Factory pix's of the cooler in the front trunk and
Im working on putting my cooler in the front trunk under a fiberglass
copy of the factory cooler cover. I hang out with several PCA/POC
racers/builder and have seen alot of different ways to mount cooler. The
one I like the best in a 914 is to run the lines in Steel up the right
(pass) side and up into the top of the fender well as not to interfere
with the wheel,  and then use SS lines to the cooler.Just go look at the
way the factory mounted cooler in the 911 and ran hard lines to it. Dont
use rubber and there should be no reason to run the line into the car as
the factory did, remember they where race cars. So far I havent bought
the lines or fitting but I have the cooler and cover (about $250) and
exspect to spend another $200 on lines and fittings and then there is
still the thermostat at $200, So it can get expensive.

 Good luck, 

  Don
