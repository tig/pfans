When I put my oil cooler on, my temps were cut in half.  Granted, I
don't have a head temp gauge, so god knows what they're running at, but
I never had any overheating problems.  This was running between 7.9 : 1
and 8.0 : 1, though, and now I'm talking about 8.2 : 1.  Even if I did
get a head temp gauge, I don't have any idea what acceptable readings
would be, and if I remember correctly, neither do VW or Porsche.  Does
anyone here know?

One more thing:  The PO of my car pulled the bellows off, so the flaps
are no longer mechanically operated.  I've got a big fat oil cooler up
front, though.  So, if I want to maximize air flow around the cylinders,
and disregard air flow to the stock oil cooler, how should I wire my
flaps up (or should I just take them out)?

Thanks again,
