I use a hole reamer from radio shack to alter the hole size in the pad. I 
found that the "holes" were square, not round. After rounding them, they 
fit. You also may have to file the edge of the pad so that they slide 
smoothly into the caliper. 

Also, a handy tool to have is a disk brake pad speader, used to push the
pistons back into the caliper before inserting the new pads. Snap On
carries them, as does KD Tools, I think. A pin punch is a better tool than
a regular punch for removing the pins (after you take the clips off, of
course). Sears has a variety to choose from. Finally, the Snap On 3/8" 
socket drive hex tools are *much* better than those "L" shaped allen keys 
from Sears. The Snap On tool is made to much higher tolerances than the 
others, which is very important when you're trying to remove an 
over-torqued allen bolt (and cursing out loud at the person who did it).
