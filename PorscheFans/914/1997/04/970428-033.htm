Hi Jeff,

Sure....here's why I would NEVER do it again (with one exception):

The cost.....it'll cost several thousand dollars in order to do this
"right".

Reliability....if you cut corners on the price, you'll sacrifice on
shift quality
which may result in missed shifts resulting in blowing up your expensive
engine.

Mr. Hussey touched on a couple of points: balky shifting with the
915 trans, and more rearward weight. The cable shifters are ugly
and I'll have to make a special center console in order to cover the
thing up.

The Vellios shifter conversion is more "factory", and I'm not sure if
you'll have to modify the 914 center console to accomodate the
911 shifter.  This shifter scheme allows you to retain the factory
914-6 exhaust.

Any type of cable shifter will result in an exhaust change.  My
factory 914-6 heat exchangers are too long when coupled with
a pair of generic "turbo" mufflers so the mufflers stick out beyond
the rear bumper.  Finding short mufflers that actually quiet the
engine even a small amount is a tough task.  I'm getting some
custom stainless steel headers welded up with short primaries
so I can move the mufflers forward 6 inches.

My Patrick Motorsports cable shifter has already shown that
the jam nuts will come loose, resulting in "losing" gears.  I'll
solve that with some loc-tite.....but it's illustrative of what you
have to figure out and "solve" when you debug aftermarket
equipment....no matter who makes it.

You'll also have to figure out the clutch issue....I made a
bracket to hold a 914 tranny "wheel" and played with the
angle to achieve good leverage so my left leg doesn't become
as large as a redwood....

PM has a funky machined part which tosses the wheel,
but it costs about $289 and if the integral cable should
break, you won't find one at your local VW dealer....

Then how do you attach the axles?  The 911 CVs
have different splines than the 914 half-shafts...and
the 911 half-shafts are too short in a 914 application.
Time to spend more money....

Almost forgot....I think you'll have to buy another starter.

It's a lot of work to do the conversion....for what???  So
you'll have a tranny which will be able to withstand the large
amount of torque a MONSTER engine can produce.
Please note that I said TORQUE, not HP....torque is
what does the damage.

Define MONSTER.  That's the key.....and is my one
exception to avoiding this conversion.  If I had a 300 ft-lb
torque engine hooked up to a 901 trans, it'll eat it for
breakfast.  This is when I'd go for the 915 tranny.

Anything less than that and I'd stick with the 901,
especially for a street car.  With good driving habits
a 901 should last a long time (avoid dumping the
clutch at the traffic light).  If it breaks, get another
since they are CHEAP!!!!

Why did I do the 915 conversion?  To be living proof
you shouldn't!!!  :-)

Good luck,

Allan
