I've had a very small nail in one of my tires since I dropped my valve
seat last fall.  Throughout the winter I re-inflated the tire every
month, noticing that the leak resulted in a loss of about 10 psi per
month.  I took the tire into a local shop and had an internal patch put
in, and asked what kind of speed I could safely take the tire to now.  I
was told that the tire wouldn't be safe over 65 mph.  I talked to a
friend of mine, and he said that if an internal patch is used, than the
tire retains its original speed rating ("V" in my case).  Since these
two bits of information seem to contradict each other, I thought I'd ask
the list.  I've had flat repaired in the past, and I've taken them well
above 65 without any trouble.  Was I playing with fire?

Thanks,
