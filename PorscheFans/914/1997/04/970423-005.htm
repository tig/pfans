Porsche Introduces Child Seats Which Deactivate Passenger Side Air Bags

NEW YORK CITY --- Porsche Cars North America, Inc. has presented to the
U.S. market a line of child seats which will deactivate passenger side air
bags on its 1997 and later model year sports cars including the complete
911 series and the new Boxster.

Created to address the concerns of child air bag safety in two-seat
vehicles like the Boxster, the new Porsche child seats will both
mechanically and electronically deactivate the passenger side air bag when
properly installed on the front passenger seat. The installation procedure
involves the mounting of a special cross bar assembly to the front seat
rail attaching bolts. Included in this assembly are a cross bar buckle and
two-pin connector. The passenger side air bag is deactivated when the
connector is plugged into the lead for the air bag control unit located
under the passenger seat, and the child seat belt is inserted into the
cross bar buckle. When this process is completed, the system readiness is
indicated to the driver via the blinking air bag warning lamp which blinks
for 10 seconds after the ignition is turned on.

The new Porsche child seat line features three different seats designed for
three occupant sizes based on body weight: up to 22 lbs., 20 to 40 lbs.,
and 37 to 100 lbs. Each seat is equipped with its own safety belt system
including the adapter which inserts into the cross bar buckle common to all
three.

U.S. Porsche dealers will be selling and installing the new Porsche child
seats beginning in May of this year. While not yet finalized, pricing is
expected to be competitive with premium seats currently being offered in
the market.
