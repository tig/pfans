  If no one has come up with an answer on this yet, I will venture one.   If you 
take a look at the theoretical starter diagram (Fig. 9.5) on page 122 of the Haynes 
manual, you will notice that the starter solenoid has two windings: a "pull-in" 
winding, and a "holding" winding.  This is fairly common practice on large 
industrial contactors where a large amount of energy is needed to move an armature, 
but only a small amount is needed to hold it in place once it gets there.  To save 
money, the "pull-in" coil is built to operate for only a short time, and would fry 
if powered for more than a few seconds.  Fortunately, once it's job is done, the 
"holding" coil can take over and maintain the contact closure.
  In the case of the 914 starter, there are two current paths through the two 
windings.  (I will use conventional current flow here.)  The first path is from the 
key switch to terminal 50 on the starter, and thence through item 7 (pull-in coil) 
through the motor windings (remember, when the key is first turned, the motor is 
stalled, and so represents very low resistance) and on to ground.  The second path 
is the same through terminal 50, and then diverges through item 6 (holding coil) 
and directly to ground.
  When the solenoid pulls in, note that the pull-in coil is effectively out of the 
circuit (shorted out by the high current switch in the solenoid itself), leaving 
the holding coil to keep things running.  
  When the key is released, the two solenoid windings are suddenly placed in 
series, with current flow in the pull-in coil opposite to what it was when the key 
was turned.  (Current path is from terminal 30 through item 3, through item 7 past 
terminal 50 [now not connected to anything because you let go of the key] through 
item 6 and on to ground.)  This means that the magnetic field polarity in the 
pull-in coil is also reversed, opposing that of the holding coil.  The result is a 
quick collapse of the field holding the starter solenoid engaged, which causes the 
drive unit to disengage smartly and the high-current switch to open, returning the 
starter to a quiescent state; exactly as the designer intended.
  Now, let us suppose hypothetically that the "pull-in" winding becomes partially 
shorted.  The starter will probably still engage, because there are still a few 
turns working on the pull-in coil, and the holding coil may be enough to do the job 
anyway.  However, once the key is released, there is not much of a field in the 
partially shorted pull-in coil to oppose that of the holding coil.  Further, the 
holding coil is being supplied with more voltage than normal because of the reduced 
resistance of a partially shorted pull-in coil.  The result is that the field 
produced by the holding coil is sufficient to maintain operation of the starter.  
In electronics, this is known as a "latching relay": a device that once engaged 
cannot be dis-engaged except by removal of the power supply.
  My bet is that you have a bad starter solenoid.  If you can borrow a known 
working starter from someone else, try it and see if it fixes the problem.  If so, 
buy a rebuilt starter.  If not, I am completely stumped.

                                                  Good Luck,
                                                  Jim T.
