after sleeping on it, i awoke realizing that the only thing that could
couse this thing to run w/o fuel pressure was VERY WIDE inj pulse width
which might theoretically allow a strong vacuum to draw fuel.  Of course
the "booK" lead me to the Head Temp Sensor which tested OK, but could
cause a wide pulse if it was -35 outside, so then i discovered that
there was a bad connection inside the connector block that marries the
sensor wire to the harness.. it runs ok now, but still is on the rich
side with everything adj lean...

i have two of everything, so methodical replacement of one part at a
time had not fixed it, and the cold start inj was not involved cuz i was
using that port for the press gage

other discoveries:  someone had put a screw in the air bleed hole in the
throttle butterfly... probly to mask other air leaks at some past
time... the fuel tank outlet & inlets were reversed & the filter screen
gone...  oh, the joys of restoring a 25 year old car with parts from six
others!

George Hussey & Dan Freedman are the ace's who id'd the fix & i really
appreciate the help from everyone & the wealth of info in this group!!
