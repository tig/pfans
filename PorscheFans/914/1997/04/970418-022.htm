	No.  The flaps are still important to see that the air goes to
the correct places.  I believe that the effect of pulling them out en-
tirely is not only that you get less air going to the right parts of
the head (and cylinders), but *also* that the cooling air going over the
top of the oil cooler creates a low-pressure zone that draws warm air up
from under the engine (remember, heat exchangers dump out there), passes
it through the oil cooler (heating it further) and then over the heads
and cylinders.  Not exactly good for cooling things off.
	I also don't know of any air-cooled production car motors that
were designed with external oil coolers and without engine-mounted ones.
I think that means it's better to have the regular cooler working as well
as the external one.

	I have one friend who has gone to the 911-style fan shroud and
says that everything runs cooler because of it.  That would seem to me
to be the only way you don't need the cooling flaps.
	As Gary said, there are really very few (or none) extra parts on
these engines.
