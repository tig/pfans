Standard Cooper is rate at 100 PSI @ 80C if memory serves correct.  Same
as CPVC is rated.  I know this because I was looking at some pipe to
carry my air supply about my shop, getting sick of draging a hose.  But
Dirk the trombone coolers still came with a oil thermostat, at least the
SC I got mine off of had the thermostat and a trombone cooler.

BTW, just for interest, I like to mount mine in the engine compartment
near the tank or sump.  It is the  way the factory did it. 911s
thermostats are mounted in the lower rear passenger fender well.  And
from the 914-6 GT and 916 pictures I have the oil thermostat is mounted
in the engine compartment.  The idea is to keep oil from going down line
and cooling until the engine warms up.  It is true the trombone style
cooler will take the pressure, but Porsche wanted the engine to warm up.

JJ,

Check with one of the racer places Summit comes to mind, I have seen oil
thermostats for less that $80.  But I would probally not use them.

Take care,
