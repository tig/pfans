O.K., I'm just going to start rambling off some thoughts.  I'm not
entirely clear as to how the fuel system works, so this will probably be
more education for me than help for you, but hey, who knows?

First, I'm assuming that you meant "different pressure regulator" when
you said "different pressure sensor", since the manifold pressure sensor
probably wouldn't cause these problems.  I'm under the impression that
the pressure regulator detects when the pressure falls below your
setting (28 psi), and tells the fuel pump to turn on.  I may be way off
here, of course.  If this is the case, then it would seem that the
pressure regulator, or something related to the regulator, is screwed
up.  Since you switched regulators, I'd have to assume something else
related to the regulator.  Are there any fuses or relays associated with
the switching of the fuel pump?  If so, I'd check those.  The fact that
when you turn the pump on, it dies, is rather strange.  If the injectors
are pulsing correctly, then I can't see any way that the engine could
flood.  Is it possible that if the fuel pump was hooked up backwards,
that it would remove fuel from the lines, rather than fill them?  If so,
that could be your problem.  Please correct my on my incorrect
assumptions, and I hope this helps somehow.
