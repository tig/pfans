For J.J.,  Larry M., and other interested parties:

  Boy do we have some big crows here in the antelope Valley (ravens actually) and only the fact that 
they are a protected species is saving me from having to eat one!

  I was putting my old barrels away for safe keeping yesterday, and I found some carbon deposits 
on the OUTSIDE of the top ridge!  J.J... I would now suggest you do as MSHP suggests and put your 
spacers at the bottom and forget the head gaskets.... the leaks probably can't be any worse, and 
may be better.

J.J. says:

  I think that your measurements are probably correct... mine average about .012" with Kolbenschmidt 
Euro pistons ( no gaskets or spacers under the barrels).  All it takes is one clean-up cut by a 
machinist on the cylinder seating surfaces on the case and the original deck height specs are a 
forgotten memory.

J.J. continues:

  Hey J.J.... I just sent Larry M a copy of my spreadsheet... if you want one too, just ask.  One thing that 
I found was simply amazing:  the small changes necessary to go between 7.6 to 1 and 8 to 1.  Just 2 
or 3 thousandths will change C/R by a tenth or so...  the spreadsheet is really handy for plugging in 
small changes to see what happens.  One thing that I've said before, and I will say again, is 
measure!  The 2 cc's variation that you mention in combustion chamber volumes and the 2 cc's 
variation in piston dish volumes will take you from one extreme to the other, as you have seen with 
your calculations.  You have to KNOW... guessing just won't hack it.  It really isn't that hard to make 
the measurements.  Try it... you'll like it!

  See above; I don't think that your deck height is abnormally low... unless the "deck height" that 
MSHP is talking about includes the head gasket thickness already.  In my case, with no shims or 
gaskets under the cylinders, stock head gaskets, and a "deck height" (piston to top edge of cylinder 
clearance) of .012", the calculated C/R worked out to 7.93 to 1, or something like that... exactly what 
the designers of the Euro piston sets would want for the average guy who can't be bothered with all 
that fiddlin' measurement.

  Incidentally, there is no requirement for cylinder base gaskets; just plain sealer works just fine.  One 
rebuilder that I read even recommends against the paper base gaskets; he says that they just 
squeeze out and cause more problems than they solve;  I put mine together without them (shims 
only).

                                                  Good Luck,
                                                  Jim T.
