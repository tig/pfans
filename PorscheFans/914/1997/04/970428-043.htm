Greetings 914-er's!

  The VW book that I have recommends water, with a bit of food coloring in it.  If you put some grease 
around the top edge of the piston, and "glue" the plexiglass on with it, then you should be able to get 
good results using colored water.  (Whoops, I forgot... "coloured" water... I used to be an MG owner!)

  You need to talk to someone more knowledgeable than myself on that one... you could look for 
machining marks in a circular pattern around the "deck"... but unless you find them, there's no 
guarantee that the heads weren't cut and then the evidence polished out.  I'd measure mine for you, 
but I bolted them back on the engine a week ago and am pretty well into the reassembly, so I really 
don't want to take them off again!

  Anyway, If I remember, you were concerned about getting sufficient compression; with that small 
combustion chamber volume, you should be able to leave out your head gaskets, shim up the 
bottom of the cylinders like you wanted to, and end up just about anywhere you like!

  As I mentioned earlier, the VW book recommended (and I used) water.  Brake fluid is readily 
soluable in water, and you should be able to rinse all the brake fluid away with a thorough hot water 
rinse.  After cc-ing my heads with water, I used WD-40 (the WD stands for Water Displacing) in liberal 
amounts in the combustion chamber.  This should protect the valves and seats from rust until you get 
the engine running, at which point, it becomes academic.

                                                  Regards,
                                                  Jim T.
