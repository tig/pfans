OK you've answered mt questions about shipping damage to the original
poster and the book with your response: "We force everyone here to
subscribe to the newspaper and then feed them all to Ollie Senior our
giant paper shredder, our packing peanut bill is out of sight, and our
shipper is so meticulous that I really think he is a girl, and our parts
still get damaged!"

I understand, my day job is with a trade association, and a great part of
what we do is shipping / mailing via all of the available carriers, and
we are always dealing with damage and nondelivery problems.

What about my other questions, where I said, "Now I don't know if Mr.
Hussey or others were reviewing really old PorscheFans archives, if the
bean counters tallied up how much I'd spent so far, or what, but I
received a new, un-dinged poster, and the T-shirt with the cut-a-way view
of a 914.  Totally un-ordered.  I don't know if this is an offer to
restore my faith in AA, a new customer service push, and enticement to
attend the 914 gathering in Atlanta this year, or what."

It IS quite unusual to receive a poster you already have and a T-shirt,
out of the blue, for no apparent reason, and with no explanation inside. 
Just curious : - )
