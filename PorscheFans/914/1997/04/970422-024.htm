Ok, there's all this talk of Copper tubing and how high a pressure it
can hold. I've used copper tubing to hold very high pressures, upwards
of 2000psi in some gas systems, and upwards of 500psi in some fluid
systems too. But there are two important factors here that nobody has
mentioned yet. 

One: COST! Copper tubing is expensive, period. Yes, braided SS is very
expensive too, and that brings us to...

Two: Durability. Copper is a very soft metal, and can easilly be damaged
and/or fatigued. I would never want to have copper oil lines (or any
high pressure lines) located anywhere that debris or excessive flexing
can damage my valuable oil lines. Copper is used in HVAC systems because
it's cheaper than SS braided lines and takes much less time to fabricate
and install than SS hard lines, due to the softness of the metal. But
copper lines are rarely installed in locations where excessive movement
can cause the line to fatigue and fail, unless there is a strict service
lifetime on each line and a scheduled replacement rate. A car (race car
especially) is just too vunerable to flexing and debris to make me feel
safe with copper lines. I'm not an HVAC proffessional, so I'm only
speaking from experience of setting up experimental gas and hydraulic
laboratory systems, but I figure Mikey can and will correct me if I'm
too far out of line here. Eh Mikey?

I say, either make hard steel lines or bite the bullet and get SS
braided lines. But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong...
