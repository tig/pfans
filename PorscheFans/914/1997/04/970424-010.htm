OK, here's why you WANT vacuum advance.  Long explanation:

Ignition advance is because it takes time for the fuel to burn.

As the the engine is turning faster, more degrees of advance is
needed to allow for more time.

That is why distributors have an advance mechanism.

The total TIME it takes for the fuel to burn is a function of
how much fuel is actually in the cylinder.

That is why vacuum advance is used; it adjusts the advance based
on its best guess of how much fuel is in the cylinder.

An .009 will give you more horespower; but only at wide open
throttle.  Good for race cars, which tend to have binary (two-
position) throttles.  But bad for street cars, which spend 99%
of their time at mid-throttle positions.  (Except for testosterin
poisoned VDub nuts...:)

A .050 might be a good choice.  Or heck, keep your old one, and
just ignore the FI points.
