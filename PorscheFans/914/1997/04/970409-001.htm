A few weeks ago I posted a query to the List -- where could I get removable
numbers?  I got a bunch of responses and went forward with SoloTime.  Some
people asked me to report on what I found ...

I've now done my first track event:

I bought 'removable re-usable' numbers from SoloTime. 316-683-3803.

They are available in  8" @ $3.50
		      10" @ $4.50

Styles are	Block
		Block Slant	# I got this type
		Curved
		Curved Slant

They applied easily and were pretty easy to remove.  The only trick seems to be
to be very careful when removing them so that they don't rip (they are
quite thick, though, so I don't think ripping is a likely problem) or pull
off any paint.

2 word summary: I'm happy


ps:	I also got a tire pyrometer from them.  $125 -- seemed like a good
	price.  (I haven't used it yet.)

pps:	Usual notices apply -- YMMV, and I have no interest/involvement in
	SoloTime.
