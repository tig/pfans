Jeffrey, Stephen, George, Rich,

Thanks for the pointers on replacing late style [75-6] bumpers with early
ones. By putting your individual responses and tips together, I think I
have a complete installation picture. To verify:

1) The old style bumpers use mounting holes that may/may not be 
apparent from the outside body panels. 

2) The four mounting holes on each bumper are most easily located from
the inner fenderwell on the front; and inside [2], and below [2] the trunk
in the rear.

3) The 'new' mounting holes may have to be drilled
through from the outer to the inner panel, which will expose the
threaded mounting nuts. On some cars, a reinforcement bracket is
welded on the front to spread the load of the bumper's weight. if
this doesn't exist, fender washers can be substituted.

4) The old impact absorbers and hardware should be removed and 'recycled'. 

5) The lighting hardware on both front [fogs] and rear [license plates]
must be changed over to the early style.

5) The new mounting scheme requires a rubber insulator, shaped
like a 'dogbone', to be used between each bumper mounting point and the body
panel.

4) The 'extra' drainage rim for the front bumper cover should be removed.

P.S. Here's hoping that the list software gets replaced soon. I only 
received ONE digest in March, and it had a single posting!
