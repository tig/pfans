Greetings, 914-er's!

  I, too am doing some top-end work, and when removed, my original barrels were quite rusty, 
although they had aproximately 60K miles on them.  However, the formation of new rust can happen 
in minutes under the right conditions.  When scrubbing out my brand new Kolbenschmidt barrels to 
remove the factory honing abrasives, a yellow-orange patina formed in minutes, owing to too cold 
water and not thorough enough drying.  
  The rust resistance of some barrels is due to whatever preservsative coatings / oil that remains on 
them after installation... the cleaner they are when installed, the sooner they will rust.  Rust is 
inevitable, hot cast iron in the presence of oxygen will rust, period.  The only way out is to remove the 
presence of oxygen.  This is traditionally done by painting.  The use of a good high temperature flat 
black automotive paint in sparing quantities has been recommended as a good way to reduce 
cylinder temperatures by as much as 30 degrees, owing to it's superior radiating surface and it also 
has the side benefit of retarding the formation of rust.

  My new jugs are drying as I write this, and I hope to install them tomorrow.
  Of course, the usual precautions apply... oil the inside and all machined surfaces after the soap and 
water scrub.  Do not neglect a thorough drying with a hair dryer on high heat setting.  It is not 
necessary to oil the fins, and is counter-productive, for one wishes his paint to stick.  It is necessary 
to mask off the critical ends of the barrels to prevent paint getting on the bore or the locating ridges, 
but the rest of the jug can be painted nicely with a spray can.  Hollidays are better than too muich 
paint, as thick coats of paint are insulative in nature, and we wish to promote heat transfer, not inhibit it.

   I hope that this is of some help.                       Regards,
                                                  Jim T
