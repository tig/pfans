In the Excellence issue before last, in the ads section, there was a
914-6 for sale with 16x8 944 turbo "s" fuchs. from what I could see of
the picture, the burping of the fenders was minimal. Has anyone tried
the 16x8 or taller wheels??    I had a 71 914 with "burped" fenders and
15x7 repro fuchs (911 offset I think) didn't look like there was much
more room to grow in wheel/tire width, is there problems clearance of
the control arm and the wheel/tire??
