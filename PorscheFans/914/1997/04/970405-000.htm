I just remembered I had not told the list what the final resolution to this
problem was, a problem that no mechanics or list members I talked to had
ever heard of before.

The #1 exhaust valve lifter apparently was not rotating normally, and wore
an irregular surface, though on inspection this was not obvious. This was
replaced, and now the car is fine. I suppose that at different times,
different portions of the irregularly worn surface were making contact with
the cam, thus resulting in randomly varying valve clearances.
