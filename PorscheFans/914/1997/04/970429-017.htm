	You can install the whole thing with the engine in the car.  It
will, however, make your life easier later if you run an extra wire or
two from the engine compartment through to the cockpit.  You can use a
twist-tie to bunch 'em up out of the way near the firewall.
	It may also make sense to buy the "adaptor kit" for the dual
sender and install it now.  You should be able to screw your stock idiot
light sender into the adaptor.  It's a real pain in the butt to tighten
the hose down into the crankcase with the engine tin installed.  It can
be done (I used needle-nose pliers--yech!) but it's not fun.
