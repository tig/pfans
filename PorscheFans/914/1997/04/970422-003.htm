I agree with this completely.  My car currently does not have one, and
on three occasions the thick oil has "backed up" at the cooler, popping
the lines off.  Fortunately, it was only a matter of seconds so no
damage was done.  None the less, it's still a good idea.  I haven't been
able to find one for less than about $250, though.  Currently, I've got
one that gets sandwiched between the case and the oil filter.  It looks
like it might have worked at one time, but it doesn't work now.  Is
there a way to get this fixed, or does anyone know of another thermostat
that mounts in the same fashion, but is substantially less than $250?

Thanks,
