	Oh geez Dave, talk about exagerations here. Ok, so what if George or
Rich or Otto, the 914 gurus want to retire? There are far more people
knowledgable about CIS (K-Jet and KE-Jet) than there probably ever were
for D-Jet. Like I said, the knowledge base is huge for CIS. No
manufacturer builds carburated cars for sale in the US anymore, should
everyone now forget about getting their 440 4-barrel hot rod fixed?

I've owned two cars (present cars included) that were CIS equiped, and
have had far more problems with the one D-jet car than both of the CIS
cars combined. I can think of no major detractors for CIS. And what if
the DME system starts to go bad? Is your only recourse a dealership that
has a diagnostic computer? Shell out the mega bucks for your own? Yes,
the DME is more versitile, but I really can't say it's so far superior
that CIS is no longer worth considering.

Have you ever worked with CIS? No question that the 3.2 is much better
than the 3.0. The 3.0 is superior to the 2.7 as well, evolution of the
breed. But the 3.2 is going to be more expensive than the 3.0 too.
