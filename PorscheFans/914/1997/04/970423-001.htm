i originally posted this back in January, but it is cleaned up for this
rerun: have just reassembled 2.0 with about 8.5 cr & new stock 7.6
pistons.
.... my calculations look something like this:  94mm bore X 71mm stroke =
493cc swept volume, add cyl head vol = 52cc, add dish vol = 5cc, add
gskt vol = 5cc, add deck clearance = 9cc, = 564cc total vol @bdc, 71cc
@tdc for CR = 564/71= 7.95 or leave out the gskt  for 559/66= 8.47 CR;

  .. back issues of magazines said TYPE 4 heads could be flycut about
..050 inch (about  2mm) for higher CR.  My local VW shop said "SURE we
can"... then they discovered that heads had been cut before, and stopped
at .025, becuz much more would get near or into the exhaust stud holes
and mess up things a lot... so lesson 1 is hope ya have virgin heads; 
lesson 2 is that at  beyond .070 in. cut you may have big trubl. (joys
of unknown historical atrocities) ( some people should not be allowed to
buy tools...).. have somebody check your swap meet heads for this

Mark Stephens Performance: redid the heads w/ new ss valves and
drop-proof seats & fixed the dents the loose valve head made ... all for
about $300 ( i know, the sodium valves are gone)... Partsman Bill at MSP
seems very knowledgeable, and can reel off deck heights & head volumes
from memory... he says stock deck ht (distance between piston top & head
top is about 070 in.  914-2 heads should have about 62-65 cc volume, 
whereas mine now cc about 52.... my deck ht is about 035 in.  All this
"...is about." measuring is  best I can do at home, even with a real cc
setup and using Ray Litz' (Competition Engineering) info sheet on deck
ht (easier than clay)...GET CE's INFO or KIT, fellas!

  Bill says the dish in stock 914 pistons varies frm 5-7cc, and best I
can measr, my new 7.6's have 4cc.  Then there's the head seal (gskt)...
my new kit from EBS in Sparks has .77mm gskts, whereas my old squished
gskts measr 1mm.  After much calculating I decided to leave the gskts
out and go for 8.5 cr and see how it works.  Rich Bontempi, Bill & the
guys at German Parts all say that the head gskts are superflous, so ya
can figure they will make about a 9-12cc variance in CR calculations and
this is the cheapest boost there is

end result is that my flycut heads installed w/o gskts seat about 2mm
closer to the case as compared to a newly acquired 2.0 used motor that I
recently bought (owner said is was never apart, but upon pulling the
heads I found deep dish VW bus pistons... so the CR had to be under 7:1
if the heads were not flycut... but it seems there was a time in history
when the standard route to hi CR was to cut the heads...) (Type 1 guys
started this...)

Bill says stock VW typ 4 heads have about 50cc vol, and use deeper
piston
dish..  My flycut 2.0 heads are now at 52cc, about 10-12 cc less than
stock, but that's about the volume of the head seal, so you still have a
choice...)( I haven't checked the used heads yet)

RE deck clearance (height):  you measure the clearance between the top
of the piston at the edge, and the BOTTOM of the head, at the top &
bottom edges, and avg  it since the piston will want to tip a bit...
this can be tho't of as similar to having an extra thick gskt in there
in terms of how it affects unswept volume.

don't leave out the base seals... it'll leak oil there.., but you can
fiddle with the clearances this way...(years ago, on a 2.8 RSR sixer, i
had to space the cyls  .080 out from the case .. to get it DOWN to
9:1... with a whole host of related fitment problems resulting... but
that was a "standard solution" back in 1978... don't believe the guy who
says "its a bolt on mod")

I chose stock p&c partly for price & availability & partly 'cuz I
was worried about getting the cr too high for street gas.  As it goes so
far, the motor is real strong & doesn't ping on 89 octane at 2700
altitude, but I'll bet it will need 92 gas down in the valley on a hot
day...

you can see that small errors in cc'ing & measuring can lead to
significant real CR differences, so i try to err on the low side and
round off toward the safety margin...   measure everything 3 times. and
if the results change, do it 3 times more.. QUESTION THE ANSWERS. (p.s. 
I use brake fluid for cc'ing....)

also be aware that the heads came back from Stephens without any
attention to the exhaust studs which had already been poorly helicoiled
in some earlier iteration...( i generously hope Stephens didn't do
that...) of course I didn't realize this until I was putting on the
headers while laying under the car... some days you go 2 steps back..
