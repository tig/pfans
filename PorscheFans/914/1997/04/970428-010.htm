	An interesting note:  The "Euro" 2.0 with 8.0:1 CR is spec'd for
either 94 or 95 ROZ, which is around 89-90 US Pump octane.  So the 8:1
folks may be able to run well on the mid-grade stuff.
	The Euro 1.8, at 8.6:1 CR is spec'd at 98 ROZ, or 92-94 US pump
octane, so you'd better run "super" in that kind of motor.  Then again,
that car put out 85 HP vs. 76 for the US version (7.3:1).

	The octane info comes from a Euro 74 owner's manual that came
with my US-spec 1.8, which I recently found in one of my boxes 'o' stuff.

	A further note:
> ...one 911 piston maker says their 9.25 piston will work on pump gas...

	This probably doesn't hold true for 914s, because (among other
things) the combustion chamber on 914s is quite different from the ones on
a 911, and that will affect how easily detonation occurs.
	I do wish that Porsche had done more modification to the heads
when they "helped" VW design the 2.0 motor.  Maybe patterned them after
the 356 heads, which can run quite high CRs on street gas...  Oh well, it
probably would have cost more and sold less that way.
