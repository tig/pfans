I'm not 100% certain, but I believe if you look at your 914-4 exhaust,
you'll get an idea of what the 914-6 exhaust length will be.  Then
you'll realize you don't have much space from the end of the header
to the rear of the car.  What you don't want to happen is to have the
muffler sticking out beyond the bumper so it'll get hit by a low air
dam if you are rear-ended....you won't like the damage to your
engine.

By the way....SuperTraps aren't very good mufflers.  They are loud
and not very efficient.

A friend of mine bought the GPR mount....it is well built and I doubt
it'll bend with your engine, but it's too tall.  It'll reduce your
ground
clearance.  At least it was this way a couple of years ago.

After seeing bent bars, I'd probably buy a cheap one and weld
reinforcing plates all over it....making it UGLY, but strong...  :-)
This rules out the PM bar (for me anyhow)....making mods to
chrome moly isn't for the average guy.

KEP has a good name in the kit car industry and they've been in
business for years.  I've only heard good things about them.

IMHO, it's just pieces of metal to stop the exhaust heat from frying
your engine so I'm sure repro is just fine.  However, DON'T BUY THE
FIBERGLASS STUFF!!!  Odds are you'll break it trying to install
your engine.

I've heard of one guy who took a set of old 911 sheet metal, and
a set of 914-4 sheet metal and cut and welded them together.  A
little ugly, but very functional and inexpensive.

Good luck!
