Well, I had a situation where after a long day of driving I felt a miss or
two, then later, the engine died but picked up again (!?!?), then it really
died and I coasted home.  I waited a while, and then it restarted, only to
die permanently a few minutes later.

The car was o/wise in excellent shape, w/a newly installed Ignitor, so this
really baffled me.

After a lot of searching I discovered that the Ignitor's red wire had
(finally) broken right at the crimp terminal (which I had crimped -- it
wasn't Pertronix's fault).

A new terminal, crimped correctly this time (wow, was I a Dummkopf!),
solved the problem.
