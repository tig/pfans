	The tally is in.

	Three people suggested I take the car to a shop that has one
of these analyzers.
	About seven people asked me to forward any info I got, which
indicates to me that there's a lot of interest on this subject.
	Four people mentioned the analyzer in the JC Whitney catalog,
but nobody had seen or used it.
	Two people suggested using O2 sensors plumbed into the exhaust.
	One person mentioned an analyst that a friend had gotten used
from a shop that was going out of business.
	And finally, two people told me that there wasn't much that
was available for the hobbyist and were available for anything
approaching a reasonable price.

	Thanks to everyone who responded.  I guess I'll see what the
JCW catalog has to say.
