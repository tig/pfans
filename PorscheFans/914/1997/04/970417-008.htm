  Think of it this way - in order for your valves to hit your pistons,
  they would have to have a throw from the cam that pushes them out
  passed the depth of the combustion chamber of the heads.  I have no
  idea exactly how far this is....but I'm guessing that it is virtually
  impossible with a stock 2.0 cam.  

  If you want to increase the compression ratio - minimize the deck 
  height.  Memory doesn't serve me well, but I'm not sure if someone
  ever mentioned having the jugs machined to be shorter or whether you
  want to have the heads modified.

  You can get up to about 9.5:1 and still run on pump gas (premium)
  but the higher you go, the more problems you may have with 
  pre-detonation.  You also have more wear and tear on the bearings,
  rods and crank, which could and will fail catastrophically.

  The one thing about modifying *anything* on an engine that I've 
  discovered, is that there are no short-cuts to better performance
  or more HP.  You can't change one thing without it affecting 
  other aspects of your engine.  Which means to build a better engine
  you have to re-enginneer the whole system.

  I learned this lesson with the 1.7L I built.  Sure, I slapped a 96mm
  NPR kit on, new bearings, had everything balanced, got a mild
performance
  cam which still let me use my FI, put 2.0L injectors on, etc... but
  my car doesn't perform as well as it should be cause I failed to 
  take into account how the stock 1.7L heads would tolerate the changes
  I made.  At low RPM and under acceleration it is a great motor, but at
  high RPM it can no longer "breathe" correctly.  So, at some point
  I'm going to have head work done to modify the exhaust ports and
  valves to accomodate the bigger displacement, maybe the intakes too.  
  I could use 2.0L heads (I have a pair laying around) but then I'd need
  new intake manifolds, etc.

  BTW: Does anyone have a pair of 2.0L intake manifolds laying around?

  Rambling on,
