Hello Travis, 
 I spoke with the owner of the 914-6 six in Excellence last year, I had
seen the ad too and wanted to know how he did it (before I bought GT
flares). He told me that a old time hot rod body guy in the Bay area
(N.Calif) did it for him. the rear fender was split along the top and
behind the doors and a section of metal was welded in to widen it.
 My buddy is putting an original six black together that had the rear
fenders split and metal added to fit 944 Turbo 8's under the rear of his
car too. I have been told that if you burp the fender for 7's that a 944
turbo 8 will fit under (has same offset as 911, the extra in on the
inside) the rear too.
 On the six with the 944T 8's there isnt any clearence problems with the
control arm.

Good luck, 
 Don

Hello Travis and Don,

I recently bought the 914-6 you're talking about.  The "burping" for the
rear fenders is actually more noticeable than the picture lets on, but I
like it that way.  I am now in the process of "re-burping" the fenders,
front and rear to put larger R1's on the car 225/50-16 and 245/45-16's  on
7's and 8's with the stock offsets front and rear.  This is to go along with
the 3.4 and 915 going in the car.  I think the most difficult part for a
good bodyman is getting the sides to look the same,  he must use templates.  

Good luck,  Mike
