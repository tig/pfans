That "while I'm in there" virus is persistent, you can beat it back but it
always returns ;-).

I have the VDO extension tube I'm going to put on soon.  Where do those
with one already installed attach the sender end to?

One thing to consider.  Coming from the Type 1 world I liked a lot of what
Gene Berg recommended.  He never liked the cheaper gauges due to
inaccuracies.  He recommended keeping the stock oil pressure unit.  I tend
to use my gauges for relative indications so not a problem.  I got the
single out VDO oil pressure sender.  I'm going to use a tee fitting and
keep the stock sender for the idiot light along with the gauge sender.

Has anyone ever switched wires on the left console gauge so the emergency
brake uses the little oil idiot light and the oil pressure sensor uses the
BIG RED flashing light?  I'm still trying to decide what I want to do with
some changes in the gauges but it seems like a better idea to get a large
warning light for low oil pressure rather than rear brake pads!

Sure. get the VDO combi pressure sender and switch with or without the
extension tube. Use it in place of the oil pressure switch. Use the
tubing extension if you dont' want to cut the engine tin, since it is
fatter than the stock oil pressure switch.
