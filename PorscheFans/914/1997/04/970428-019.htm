I've had it with the points in my '73 911. Another set is messing up---2500 miles!!
It starts great, runs great,ect, but every once in a while I have a COMPLETE 
ignition shutdown for a fraction of a second, then it's back to normal... Yesterday 
while coming back from Indy, I could feel it die about 4-5 times at a steady rpm. It 
waswas real short, you could feel it more the hear it... When I took off from a 
light and pushing it through the gears, it stopped once and just about threw me into 
the steering wheel. The tach has been kind of eradict also. I,ve noticed that it has 
mood swings !! Sometimes it will swing from 0>6000 for a while before getting down 
to proper reading. Doesn't seem to have anything to do with the cutting out. A 
couple of weeks ago I was IRP going down the front straight and looked to see what 
rpm I was running--- the tach was all over the place but didn't miss a beat !!

I'm thinking of putting in one of those Pertronix??? pointless ignition sets in. 
Does anybody have any info on them? Anyone ever used them? Do the affect the tach? 
Any pro or cons? I want to use the CD ignition, and don't want to rebuild the entire 
system. I've got a new Permatune box in it now. I've got to figure this out in a 
hurry, I'm going up to Gingerman in about 2 weeks!!! Any help would be greatly 
appreciated....
