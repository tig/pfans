some days i forget i was an adult back when ya could buy Clark & Sunoco
102 octane at the pump... so naturally when i loked at the "oktan min 91
ROZ/RON" tag on my 73 2.0 i just ass-umed it was one of those "averaged"
specs like we see today... nada...

the 914 spec book says the GA 2.0 motors uses 91 research, at 7.6 CR, &
given that there's about a 10 point spread between RON/MON, today's pump
regular is just great.. interestingly, the 1.7 W & EA motors had 8.2 CR
& called for 98 RON, while the EB & EC motors had 7.3 CR & spec'd 91
RON... some of will recall that euro gas was/is much more pricey than
usa gas & that the EPA was starting to force out lead & reduce octane
back in the early 70's, so it makes sense that the motors were designed
for cheaper, more available gas ( anybody recall sitting in gas lines
for 1/2 day back then??)

further poking in old files reveals what we all suspect: you can go to
around 9:1 on today's pump premium, & one 911 piston maker says their
9.25 piston will work on pump gas.. i think the stock car racers all run
9:1 these days
