Actually if you make the lever arm too short it really does limit the 
suspension travel.  To convince yourself of this, imagine that the lever 
arm were 1" long.  The maximum suspension travel (of the drop link, not 
necessarily the tire) would be 2".  To be any longer, the lever arm 
length would have to be increased.  I have run with a 22mm anti-roll set 
to a lever arm length of < 4" and found that I have lots of little 
problems (like binding in the drop links, and difficult adjusting out 
pre-load) because of the reduction in suspension travel.  I'm now using 
much heavier front springs (once I reached the max torsion bar size), and 
can leave the anti-roll bar set to a more reasonable 5-6" range.

Anyway, it's good to hear that Chip has reduced his oversteer by 
tightening the front sway bar.
