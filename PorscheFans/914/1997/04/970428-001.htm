There's something here that still bothers me about VW engines, which is 
why are oversize pistons not availble? I talked to a motorcycle guy, and 
he said all of the air cooled angines get bored for oversize pistons when 
they are rebuilt, and that the pistons are commonly availble. Even the 
flat twin BMW engines are treated this way. They only replace the 
cylinders when they run out of oversize pistons. So, why, O why are we 
forced to replace the whole shebang at every rebuild??? Oh yeah, the guy 
said all of the motorcycle engines have cylinders that wear unevenly, so 
that's not an excuse.
