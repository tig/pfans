 Hello All & Glenn, 

 I just wanted to put in my 2 cents worth.  I know the machinist "George
Wright" through Glenn, and have had him do work on my 73 914-6 GT
conversion Project. He is very good ! He's very knowledgable about
Porsche, having help restore several and owning several. He's the kinda
guy, that you can tell him what you want done and it gets done, just the
way you wanted it and for a fair price.

 Good luck with the brake conversions , 
 Don
