Hi Kids,


       I'm faced with a bit of a choice and I'd like a little advice
       from the collective wisdom here. I'm doing the 914-6 conversion
       thing and a couple engines have cropped up. The first candidate
       is a 901/01 engine, 2.0l with 40IDA-3C carbs. It was supposedly
       overhauled by the service manager at Vasec Polak a few years
       ago, but has never been run. It also is supposed to have hotter
       cams, but this needs to verified. It is missing the ignition 
       system(dist, coil, wires, etc), it is kind of a long, long block.
       It has the carbs, alt/fan, a fiberglass shroud, oil cooler, and
       strangely, a quick 6 914-6 engine mount and 914-6 headers, no
       clutch or pressure plate, flywheel there but not sure if it's the
       109 or 130 tooth.Also no carb linkage. Price is $2500.00
           Behind door number 2, we have....a 911/92 engine, 2.7l from
       a 74 911t. Car was smacked in the right front, 81k miles on the odo,
       complete with CIS injection, basically missing nothing. No idea
       of service history, don't know if valve guides and/or head studs
       have been updated. Engine has not been run in several years, am
       told it may need a new fuel distributor, compression check is low
       but not alarmingly so, tough to tell with a cold engine, leak down
       is fine. Basically a tired old 2.7. Price is $2000.00
	   So which one would you choose and why? Or would you choose niether
       and keep looking? All opinions wanted here, so step right up.
