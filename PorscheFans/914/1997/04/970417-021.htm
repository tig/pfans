	I don't want to discourage you from doing this, but I do
have one data point to add.  I know of only one local (to me)
person who has done this.  He says that his FI seems to react a
little oddly to heat changes.
	His theory is that the coatings let the part of the head
with the temp sensor cool off too much for the FI system to cope
correctly.  He evidently winds up with a rich mixture for a while
after getting off the highway, until stop-n-go can heat the head
back up again.
	I don't think he knows for a fact that this is the reason
for the mixture problems, but that is his current working theory.

	I welcome data from anyone else who has gone the coating
route!
