Sounds like alot of trouble to install a tiny little cooler like the
stock unit. Why not go to a u-pull-it junk yard and get a mazda oil
cooler and install it behind the front bumper. You were going to cut
holes anyway right? Let's do it right then. Otherwise just hang a cooler
on the engine lid.

Copper?! That's not only risky but expensive. Use Aeroquip. It has the
safety and longevity close to that of hard lines and are still flexible
and will tolerate movement. If not Aeroquip, then steel. I wouldn't feel
good with 20 feet of rubber lines holding in my engines precious fluids.
