NOTE:  This message is long, but I could really use some feedback!
Thanks!

Augh!  I just don't think I should be allowed to work on cars.  I needed
to measure my deck height the other evening, so I slid two pipes over
the upper left and lower right case studs, and bolted the cylinder to
the case (20ft/lbs).  I brought it to TDC (as close as I could get) and
used feeler gauges to estimate the distance from the top of the piston
to the top of the cylinder.  I came up with .017 in.  As I pulled the
bolts and pipes of, I heard a little "tinkle" on the floor, and glanced
over to observe that the portion of the cooling fin that I had bolted
down was now lying on the floor!  The Haynes manual states that no
matter how good the cylinder looks, a broken cooling fin requires
replacement.  I spoke with a couple of mechanics, and they said the
exact opposite.  I really can't afford anything else right now, so what
would you do?  
  I'd like to see if I got my compression ratio right.  After talking
with Mark Stephens, they said that if my heads have had no other work
done (which I don't believe they have), then I can assume a combustion
chamber displacement of 63cc.  My deck height (.017 in) works out to
about 3.2cc, and the dish in my 8.0 pistons is 3cc.  The engine's
displacement is 1971cc, so one cylinder is 492.75cc.  If I do the math,
(492.75 + 3 + 3.2 + 63) / (3 + 3.2 + 63), then I get a compression ratio
of 8.1 : 1.  This seems acceptable, but there's one little problem.  I
was hoping to run without a head gasket, but if I were to I would have
piston/head contact almost immediately, due to head expansion.  The
minimum deck height permissible to forgo the head gasket is .026in.  So,
it looks like I'm going to have to pull the cylinders and replace the
..010 gasket with a .030 gasket.  This should give me a deck height of
..037 in., which will safely let me run without head gasket.  According
to my calculations, though, this will drop my compression ratio to 7.74
: 1.  So, how do I get my compression ratio up without destroying my
heads?  
  I've already ordered a new set of Total Seals, so now my only concern
(other than the broken fin) is the honing of the cylinders.  About a
year ago, I had the cylinders honed for new rings, and now I'm going to
be doing it again.  The guy who does the honing uses a stone honing
machine (not a brush), so I'm concerned about how much metal will be
removed.  Just how many times can a cylinder be honed before you need to
use oversized rings (and/or pistons)?  

Any help on any of the above would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
