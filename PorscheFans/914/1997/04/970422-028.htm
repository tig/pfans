Dirk:

Without getting into the "If it's good enough for my house,
shouldn't it also be good enough for my car?" debate (after all, I
just recommended in private e-mail to another list-member that he
mount a critical piece of safety equipment to his car using nylon
tie-wraps), I should point out that when a braided-steel hose rubs
against a body part, it's usually the BODY PART that suffers, not
the hose.

Just my opinion; I could be wrong.
