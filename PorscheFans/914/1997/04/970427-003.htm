Greetings 914-er's!

  I have just sent a request to Brian Ng to measure his pistons, if possible, while he has his engine 
apart, and thought that I'd repeat the request here to see if anyone is now in a position to send me 
some data, where they might not have been before.

 Here is the favor I wish to ask.  I have been trying for some time to get some data on the diameters 
of stock Mahle pistons.  I have a set of stock barrels and pistons, of  which I am still unable to 
determine their suitability for re-use, owing to the fact that I can't find any accurate and 
comprehensive data on the piston diameters.
  The problem is this:  The only thing that I could find wrong with my old barrels and pistons (after a 
tear-down for wildly varying and generally low compression and excessive oil smoke) was a 
possible discrepancy in piston diameters.  The Mahle pistons measured .005" smaller just below 
the oil ring grove than they did across the tabs on the bottom of the piston skirt.  (Diameter 
measurements at right angles to the piston pin axis.)  I have one book that says these dimensions 
should be within .0005" of each other, and warns that if they are equal, or the tab diameter is smaller, 
then the piston has collapsed and should be discarded.  It has nothing whatever to say, however, 
about the case that I have, where the tab diameter is considerably larger.  The Kolbenschmidts are 
as straight as an arrow over the space I describe, and only begin to taper in the area of the ring 
grooves.  However, since they are of different manufacture, I hesitate to apply their dimensions to the 
Mahles.  

  I have compiled ten diametrical measurements on my Kolbenschmidt pistons: five on diameters 
parallel to the piston pin axis, and five at right angles to the piston pin axis.  They are measured at 
the center of the top band above the first compression ring, the land between the first and second 
compression ring, the land between the second compression ring and the oil ring, the area 
immediately below the oil ring, and finally, just above the skirt edge, which is just above the bottom of 
the tabs on the diameter at right angles to the piston pin, and just above the skirt cut-out on the 
diameter parallel to the piston pin.

  If anyone out there could measure your pistons for me, the data will be very helpful to me, and will 
eventually be published on the Internet for use by anyone attempting to evaluate his existing 914 
pistons.  The most critical measurements are the ones in which I found a discrepancy between the 
Mahle and Kolbenschmidt pistons, that is the two diameters, one at the bottom of the tabs on the 
piston skirt, and one just below the oil ring groove, both measurements to be made on diameters at 
right angles to the piston pin axis.  Just these two measurements would probably enable me to 
decide whether my pistons are defective or not. 
  Of course, the complete set of measurements, preferably on all four pistons (I know this is a big 
chore, because I've done it, so I sincerely thank anyone who wants to take it on), when added to the 
Kolbenschmidt data that I have compiled, would probably constitute a fairly complete set of 
inspection specifications which would allow   914 owners to make better judgements of whether to 
save $ by re-honing and re-ringing, or to take the plunge for new jugs.

 I would greatly appreciate any input that anyone would care to give me.

                                                    Thanks in Advance,
                                                  Jim T.
