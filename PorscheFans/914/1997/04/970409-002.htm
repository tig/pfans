Well, the engine is out of the car once again (to fix an high-pressure
side oil leak, probably the damn melling aftermarket pump ordeal others
have suffered through) and I just ordered all the while I'm in there
parts for my baby.

The engine is originally at '70 1.7 which I rebuilt from the ground
up. I installed at modified cam from FAT Performance and the 96mm
NPR big bore kit at that time.  While the engine is out, I'm going
to install the Haltech (K&N) Air/Fuel meter to assist in tuning the
engine once it's back in the car.  

As usual, I have a number of questions about getting the most out of
this engine.  I've put about 600 miles on it so far, and while it runs
ok - there is a definite lack of power and it suffers from a querky
idle.  I'm seeking clues as to how to tune this engine properly once
re-installed.

The idle hunts from 800-1800 RPM as if I were revving the engine, but
after it comes off idle runs fine.  The idle mixture screw does little
to change the idle behavior and I've already checked and/or fixed the
following:
	     a) the AAR was rebuilt and tested in a hot water bath
             b) clyinder head temp sensor is new
             c) MPS seems to hold vacuum at input (checked with the
                tongue trick)
             d) injectors are all new (2.0L)

Could the idle hunt be caused by the modified cam?  Could it be the
fault of the distributor?  The timing was carefully set to factory
specs - does the modified cam require different timing?  If I install
another distributor to check if that is the culprit, can I install
a 2.0L distributor?  What is the difference between a 1.7L distributor
and the 2.0L distributor?

In any case, once the engine goes back in, I'll have the air/fuel 
metering system to ensure idle and load mixtures are ok (going to 
install a pot in series at the head tempurature sensor).  I just
want to ensure I get the most out of this engine as possible as 
previous driving experience shows it does not perform as well as it
should.

Any insight, opinions, flames, questions, help, answers, usw.
would be appreciated.
