Mike,

	I couldn't agree more. But that is why I don't compete in the stock
classes. The classes are too fluid and unfairly structered -for stock
cars-. SCCA stock classes have the singular problem of too many
different types of cars and not enough classes. Street prepared has it's
own problems, but no where near as problematic and anti-porsche as the
stock classes.

	Also, the local PCA region here has -zip- in the way of autocrossing.
Four, count 'em -four- autocrosses over the entire calendar year and
that includes one school. That just plain sucks. Lot's of drivers ed and
trials, but dink for autocrosses. And this region has one of the best
sites for autocrossing in the nation. Almost as good as mineral wells in
Texas. Too bad. But, all the more concrete for the SCCA :) 90 second
autocross courses are not uncommon. Any longer and it's a memory issue
and not a driving issue.
