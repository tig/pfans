anyone know where I can get the four wire connector from the wiring harness
to the pressure regulator or sensor or whatever it is.  it resides on the
fender below the battery box.  wires go in and hoses come and go.  The wires
go into a plastic holder withthe smallest stakon type connectors I have ever
seen.  I cannot find replacements anywhere.  The wires from the harness
leave no room to work.  The connections keep failing and I need to replace.
I will try soldering, but dont have a lot of hope because of A)skill needed,
B)room to work.  If I could find a new connector with the four metal stakons
I could make pigtais and crimp to the existing harness.  

Does the wiring go direct to the computer? I might be able to rewwire those
four wires if I can get either a new connector or new spades.  The original
has a spring clip that locks it into the connector but it is only abour 1/16
th of an inch wide.  Is it a Bosch part?  might it be a dealer item
(still?)?, might it be available through VW.  Anyone have a spare?

Thanks for any responses,
