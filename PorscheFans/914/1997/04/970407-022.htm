	OK, I ran over to Global Metrics at lunch, and picked up some
of their connectors.  What they've got:

Part #		I paid		914 use
201		 $2.80/10	Plastic plug for injector connection
316		 $1.60/10	Barbed 1/8" female spade connector
AFC Term	$11.20/25	Fuel injector connectors

302		(didn't get)	Barbed 1/4" female spade connector
				They also have one without a barb

	I didn't get the #302 or the non-barbed equivalent, as I
already have those at home.  However, the other stuff *looks* right
for the 914 application.  I'm not quite sure on the AFC Term, as I
haven't had to pull apart my FI connectors yet.
	The #320, BTW, is what goes into the T4 connector to the relay
board, among other places.  Also the stock connector for the head temp
sensor, the oil temp sender, and more of those plastic box connectors.
	I think the #316 is what Dick (or Ari) needs.

	Again, the number is:  415/592-2722, or 800/227-9981.

	Still no joy on the connectors to the brain.  Sigh!
