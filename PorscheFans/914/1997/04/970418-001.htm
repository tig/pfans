Greetings 914-er's!

  There follows the continuation of my previous monolog... if you were bored by the last one, better 
tune out now...


  There's something that I'm missing here...  putting shims on the bottom of the cylinders has 
EXACTLY the same effect as installing a head gasket...  Since the engine was designed to run with 
head gaskets, I'd for sure put them in (mine are .028") and reduce the shims (if any) by the same 
amount.  If you can get by without any shims on the bottom, so much the better... one less source of 
an oil leak.

  I am quite suspicious of the chamber volume that Mark stephens gave you... my numbers crunch to 
almost EXACTLY 8 to 1 with no shims, stock head gaskets, and 60 cc combustion chambers.  (I don't 
have enough memory to pull up the spread sheet at the same time as my mail program, but my deck 
height was .012" as I recall;  NO cylinder base gaskets or shims, which is the ideal way to put it 
together.)

  Jerry R. Brady and J.J. continue with the following conversation:

Jerry R. Brady:

"  First time I've heard about having to account for the "growth" of a
piston.  If that is the case, then a hot engine has a higher compression 
ratio than a cold one.  Also, the cylinder sleeve is what makes 
contact with the head, not the piston.  If the piston overshot the
deck (a negative deck hieght) wouldn't it just ride up into the 
combustion chamber?

Somebody straighten this issue out, since now I'm confused as well.   "

J.J. replies:

"   Yeah, negative deck height is what occurs (in theory), but the piston
doesn't just ride into the combustion chamber, it actually makes contact
with it (since it's dome shaped).  Hence, the piston/head contact that
I'd really rather avoid.  "

  O.K. guys, now you have me confused...  First, J.J.'s comment about something being 
"dome-shaped"... I can go pull my heads out of a box and look, and at my pistons also, as two of 
them are setting on the dining room table, but I don't recall ANYTHING being "dome-shaped".  Are 
you sure that you aren't thinking of a 911?  The combustion chamber shape is difficult to describe, 
but it is closest to an old-style TV screen in shape, with a sloped bottom that would give it a wedge 
shape in cross-sectional view... it is not dome-shaped.  The pistons are flat with a dished center; no 
"dome" here... and the "deck" which I believe to be the source of the confusion, is the FLAT part of 
the cylinder head inside the cylinder locating bore.

  O.K., here we go... I think that I can answer all these points with a description of the top of the cylinder 
head assembly in a 914 engine.  The first and most important point is that the combustion chamber is 
smaller in AREA than the top of the piston.  The remaining area is taken up by the "deck", the FLAT 
part of the head.  When you measure "deck height", you are measuring the distance between this flat 
part of the head and the top of the piston.  This distance is composed of two components: one, the 
distance between the flat part of the piston top and the uppermost flat part of the cylinder (head 
gasket seating surface) when the cylinder is mounted and the piston being measured is at Top 
Dead Center, and two, the installed thickness of the head gasket.  Since many people do run without 
head gaskets, the "deck height" measurement is usually refered to as only the piston to top of 
cylinder measurement.  In actuality, however, it is the sum of these two values, if a head gasket is 
used.

  Hence, the piston will NOT clear the head if a "negative" deck height occurs... it will strike the 
"deck", with disasterous results.  I have not heard of the minimum value for deck height before, but it 
sounds reasonable, as the top of the piston appears to be .020" smaller in diameter than the bore 
when cold... therefore, if a diametric growth of .020" is reasonable, an elongation of aproximately the 
same value would not be out of line.

  To sum up,  in the case of my engine, the Euro pistons and cylinders work out with stock heads and 
head gaskets to almost exactly 8 to 1.  I recommend running head gaskets, as the Porsche and VW 
people put them in, and they are not entirely stupid, and I believe that you will find that the 
compression will work out about as advertised.
  If you want or need still higher compression, then have Mark Stephens weld up the combustion 
chambers to reduce their volume... this shouldn't cost too much more than you are already paying for 
head work... but don't do it until and unless the heads are actually measured and found to be too 
voluminous;  you will only have to shim the cylinders out and will have wasted your money.

  As for me, I am trying to get a set of .020" cylinder base shims to take my Euro pistons back down to 
7.6 to 1... I haven't split the case, and don't want to stress the bottom end, nor do I want to pay for 
more than regular gas (Dave Darling says that the Euro 914's were placcarded for higher octane 
fuel).

  One other thing:  I have an Excell spread sheet that does the calculations for you.  It is not elegant, 
as it has too many embedded constants, but it does allow you to enter chamber volume and piston 
dish volume in cc's and the deck height, and head gasket thickness in thousandths.  It then 
automatically calculates volumes for those thicknesses, and computes compression ratio.  It has 
embedded constants, and therefore only works for 2.0 litre engines, but anyone familiar with 
spreadsheets could tailor it to their engine displacement.  If anyone would like a copy, I will send you 
an E-mail with the Excell file attached.  I don't want to post it to the list; Excell files get rather large.
Let me know if you'd like a copy.

  Finally, J.J. asks:

  I've already ordered a new set of Total Seals, so now my only concern
(other than the broken fin) is the honing of the cylinders.  About a
year ago, I had the cylinders honed for new rings, and now I'm going to
be doing it again.  The guy who does the honing uses a stone honing
machine (not a brush), so I'm concerned about how much metal will be
removed.  Just how many times can a cylinder be honed before you need to
use oversized rings (and/or pistons)?    "

  It depends on how much metal you take off, but the ring gap measurement as detailed in the 
Haynes book is a good way to check bore size and ring suitability at the same time.  The only catch 
is, you have to have gap-type rings for it to do you any good... If your old rings are still in good 
shape, they can probably be used to check the bore diameter of your jugs.  If not, you might check to 
see if anyone on the list has a broken set that they'd be willing to sell you a ring out of.

  I hope that this clears, rather than muddies the waters.  If I can clarify (or muddy) anything further, 
please drop me a line.

                                                  Regards,
                                                  Jim T.
