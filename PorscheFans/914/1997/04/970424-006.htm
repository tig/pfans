Well,

	I was hoping to be able to fix my mystery fuel problem today. But I
woke up to discover that I couldn't find my car. It was still there,
it's just burried under TWO FEET OF SNOW! The snow fell about 1"/minute
last night, and all I can see is a barely recognisable blob that looks
like it _might_ be a 914. And I have to use a different computer 'cause
mine doesn't have a UPS and the power keeps greying out. 

....like that...

It's practically May! Yeesh.
