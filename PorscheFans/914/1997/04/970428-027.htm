Nope didn't find any good stuff for the 914 or the Thing.
All parts I saw I already have, but always fun to search,
and seeing all the cars in good shape is incentive and
gives me ideas.

I prefer 'raspberry',  although glow-in-the-dark fuschia
also describes it ;-(.  Makes you wonder about some PO's.
The original color was Alaska Blue Metallic and I'm going
to go back to that color when I get to the paint stage.

Course it was very easy to find mine in the Pomona parking lot.

Hello Everyone,

Here in So Cal it was Porsche swap meet time this Sunday, the turn out
was great and the was some very nice 914's, 914-6's, and a few very nice
6 conversions. The parts area was good too, but not too much in the line
of nice 914 parts. I meet or ran into several listers, Glenn S was
selling parts and scored a nice set of 2.0L alloys with lugs. Son N was
shopping and scored a very nice RX-7 comp oil cooler and dropped off his
BMW calipers to have them machined. Jeff L was shopping but dont think
he found any goodies, but he did bring out the 73 2.0L +. and yes its
really is pink, well ok Jeff Purplish. Meet David B  (P-Parts dealer
with good prices) and talked for a while. and got to see Roy J and his
Very Beautiful 73 914-6 GT again.  And I scored some RS 993 mirrors
(manuel) new in the factory box complete, I saw them on another 914-6 GT
once and it looked pretty cool, so I need a set, and the price was so
good I just couldnt pass it up.
All in all it was a Good Porsche swap meet day !!

With all this said, and now that I have the 993 mirrors I would like to
sell the set (2) of stock 914 mirrors I have, they are new in there
factory boxes w/seals
and SS screws, never installed, perfect!  If your in the market for a
set, shop around like I did, I dont think you can find them cheaper. I
only want that I have into them.$210.00 and I will pay for shipping.

and I also still have a set of Wheels;

911 Fuchs 16x6's &7's, polished and
painted with caps and Michelin Z rated tires 205/55/16 and 225/50/16's
with 40% tread left and no curb grinds,   For Sale $500.00
 Im close to OC/LA/SB counties in California.


Thanks and have a Great Day,

 Don
