Greetings 914-er's!

  I have been following the give and take between Dan Freedman and Dave Darling on pushrod 
tube sealing techniques with interest:

  The pushrod tubes on my 914 2.0 litre had hugh gobs of red RTV all over the outsides of them when 
I got the car.  There was also a veritable rainstorm of oil from the several of the joints, both on the 
head and crankcase ends.  Now, in all fairness to Dan, I should say that I assume that the RTV was 
applied after the leaks had already started in an attempt to provide a "quick fix", and therefore, 
probably would not have stuck well enough to do any good, but....
   What a mess!  RTV everywhere all over the air deflectors, on the cylinder fins, smeared all over the 
outside of the tubes, and COMPLETELY ineffective.

  I put very little time on my engine before having to tear it down again for smog  (excessive oil 
consumption)  but in that time, my tubes were dry.  I put them together with oiled Viton O-rings, and 
made sure that the bores in the head and crankcase were free of gouges and dirt.  I think that that's 
all that should be necessary.  I can't see the RTV doing anything other than de-bonding with the first 
good warm-up, and then you are back to depending on the seals.  I think that the Viton type seals 
are a good idea, as I understand that the original style hardens up with heat rather quickly.  Dan 
didn't say whether or not he was using the improved seals in his race car, but if not, the heat from a 
racing engine could account for all his troubles.  

  Oh yes, I did have one small drip which cured itself; on close inspection, the Viton O-rings have 
small mold marks on the outer circumference... I assume that a few hot-cold cycle "rubs" would be 
necessary to wear off the mold marks and get down to the bulk of the seal.

  I am going to have to go with Dave D. on this one.

                                                  Regards,
                                                  Jim T.
