MY quick six mount also broke but I do not remember if I purchased from
Vellios of Martin Schneider. I changed however to the Vellious bulkhead
mount as it is far superior.
   George Vellious is a great guy, a little absent minded sometimes, but
let's face it most creative people are, and George has filled a nich that
no one would spend the time or money to do while his products stay
reasonably priced.
   The Vellious 916 shift kit works well if you want the bulky 915 shift
feel in your hand and  extra weight rearwards.  The real 916 has unique
factory linkage that combines both 901 and 915 componets actually shirts
fairly quickly and precisely, and is much better than the 72-86 911s!
However the extra weight is still there and nothing in a 914 beats the
73-76 914 linkage in a 914.
  The cable shifter however is purely for the racing 914s as it does not
readily install with factory interior.  At least the 916 linkage hides and
installs neatly in the center tunnel so that one can install a nice factory
interior.
