The best three suggestion for suspension adjustments. But I'd try
reversing those three though. Rake change will effect the front end
alignment and that gets trickier.

The problem is oversteer. If the front bumps stops are too large, he
would be losing travell and bottoming out the front suspension. This
_is_ a problem when you lower a car, but the problem this causes is
_understeer_ not oversteer. The bottoming out can also be caused by worn
out torsion bars. But the problem here is oversteer, so if bottoming out
is a problem anywhere, it'd be in the rear. How long are the rear
springs?
