I have just recieved a technical spec. on an electrical fan system for racing
914-4s.  It is pure "racing" component designed for four cylinder carburated
engines.  The kit provides for the removal of the front cooling shroud,
impeller, alternator and top sheet metal.  That alone drops engine weight 22
pounds and pulls alot of drag from the crankshaft.  The design is a verticle,
centermonted, single electrical fan system.  The fan is rated at 1250 CFM is
a low current 12V high quality fan mounted in a glass or carbon fiber shroud.
 Its an idea I have been kicking around for my vintage engine build that is
about to happen.  Don at ACC has built the product and is racing with them in
914 applications out of his Knoxville shop.  If anyone is interrested in more
information call me (972-517-1167) or e-mail me (A914Guy@aol.com) and I'll
get you copies of this document and put you in touch with Don.  Power gains
on the 2.0L racing carburated engines is reported in the 20 to 25% range over
the stock setups and 10 to 15% over the upright systems.  190 plus HP is a
reasonable possibility with a 25% gain over the stock Porsche cooling shroud
systems.  In closing I'll add these cooling systems are approved by PCA and
SCCA.
