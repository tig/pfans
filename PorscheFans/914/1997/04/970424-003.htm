>  I think that your measurements are probably correct... mine average about

>That's what I'm figuring happened at some time.  If my measurements are
>correct, then without a base gasket (like your measurement), I'd have a deck
>height of .007in.  That seems awfully low.

>  Hey J.J.... I just sent Larry M a copy of my spreadsheet... if you want one
>too, just ask.
>Sorry Jim, I couldn't wait.  I wrote my own.  It really is a handy tool to
>have!

>You have to KNOW... guessing just won't hack it.  It really isn't that hard

>Yeah, it looks like I'm going to run to the store and try to find some
>plexi-glass and a graduated syringe.  Then I'll cc my heads and pistons.
>Here's a question for you:  Right now, the top end of my motor is completely
>apart (just rods hangin' out of the case), so I'm wondering what the easiest
>way to measure the deck height (again, just to be sure) would be.  Do I need
>to put rings on a piston, put in the wrist pin, slam the cylinder down, and
>crank to 20 ft/lbs?  It seems like there's got to be an easier way.  What if
>I didn't ring the piston?  Could I still get a somewhat accurate measurement,
>if I error on the safe side?
