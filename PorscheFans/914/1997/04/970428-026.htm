Jeff:

Hope you don't mind my butting in... Here are the reasons I don't 
like the 915 conversion:

    1.  The 915 is heavier than the 901.
    2.  More gear-ratios are available, cheaper, for the 901 than 
        for the 915.
    3.  915 rebuilds are more expensive tahn 901 rebuilds.
    4.  To install a 915 in a 914, you need to flip the ring gear.
    5.  To make it shift at all easily, you need to buy Vellios's 
        expensive 916 kit.
    6.  The 915 won't work with the stock clutch arrangement.
    7.  The shift pattern is all wrong (I think).
    8.  The halfshafts need to be replaced, since the 915 splines are 
        different from the 901 splines (I think).

The ONLY advantage of the 915 (and it's a non-issue for me, 
personally) is that it's more suitable for standing starts, 
since first gear is supported better than on the 901.
