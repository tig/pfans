    Mike:

    I like it... It sounds as though Chris Schroeder (Crane Cams'
    software guy) did a good job on that one.

    Yeah, more or less... The only problem is that even with this
    "soft" limit, there are still some rather abrupt transitions
    between the on- and off-limit states.  You'd have to try it and
    see whether the car gets unbalanced as the engine comes on and
    off the limiter.

    One way to do an even SOFTER limit is to progressively retard
    the timing as you approach the limit... That may make for a
    smoother transition.

    The method I use in my software is better (in my opinion)... You
    rev the engine to exactly one-half of your desired rev limit,
    then hit a button to set the rev-limit to twice the current
    engine speed.  In the last ignition controller I did (which
    actually had TWO rev-limits -- for drag racers) this was
    accurate to +/- 1 RPM at 10,000 RPM.
