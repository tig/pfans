Hi JJ.

Well, I can only tell you what I did.  I measured my cylinders with Sunnen
bore gauges, and found that they were out-of-round and skewed, and
nominally they measured 3.7008" to 3.7014". A careful inspection showed
that the previous honing had been done with too rough a stone.  I honed
them on a Sunnen rod-honing machine that's been converted to do air-cooled
motorcyle cylinder honing, all to 3.7016" +/- .0002". Two cylinders cleaned
up beautifully, and two still had some of the previous, too-deep marks
left. The biggest challenge to me (a novice honer) was to move the cylinder
back and forth quickly enough to get the right cross-hatch angle.

3.7016" = 94.02mm, and as I read the little spec book this is still within
the wear limit (93.96/93.97mm + .2mm).  But it is a wee bit above the
nominal ring diameter. I said "what the hell, new P&C's are too expensive",
and re-assembled using old, lightly scuffed pistons and a new set of Total
Seal rings.  This motor has now done 4 or more Time Trials, and has some
street miles (500? 1000?) on it, and it seems fine.  No, I haven't done a
leakdown test, but I'm not too worried. The power seems fine, and it
consumes less than 1/3qt per race weekend, and that's probably crankcase
venting and valve guides and leaks anyway.

My biggest problem was finding _anything_ (i.e. pistons or rings) that were
94mm+ oversize -- do you know of any suppliers? So I gave up and went with
stock sizes.

BTW, I didn't worry about CR, I assembled with "washers" both below and
above the cylinders.

HTH,
