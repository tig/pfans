Hi 914-er's!

  I have been reading the mail concerning the issue of calculating compression ratios, etc. and I feel 
that I should stick in my $.02 worth.  I will try to comment on the salient points, and then throw in a few 
pithy comments.

  First, J.J. Slowik writes:

"    As I pulled the bolts and pipes of, I heard a little "tinkle" on the floor, and glanced
over to observe that the portion of the cooling fin that I had bolted
down was now lying on the floor!  The Haynes manual states that no
matter how good the cylinder looks, a broken cooling fin requires
replacement.  I spoke with a couple of mechanics, and they said the
exact opposite.  I really can't afford anything else right now, so what
would you do?  "

  Welcome to the club, J.J. !  I did the exact same thing with my brand-new Euro barrels and pistons.  I 
have only two things to say.  One, if you look at where the failure occured, you will notice that it took 
out a portion of the fin that is mostly stud clearance hole anyway, and is the fin closest to the head.  
This means that there won't be any hot spot, because of conduction to the head, and there won't be 
any stress risers, because the area around the stud hole is already weak because of the hole.  If you 
were missing a significant fraction of a fin near the middle of the jug, it might be cause for concern; 
where it is, I wouldn't worry about it... I'm not.  Two, when you put your retainers on, be sure that they 
rest on the machined ridge next to the main part of the jug, and not on the fin.  (Be sure to notice that 
this does NOT mean on the very top of the jug, where the sealing surface is!)

  Next:

 "   After talking with Mark Stephens, they said that if my heads have had no other work
done (which I don't believe they have), then I can assume a combustion
chamber displacement of 63cc.   "

   I once was told that "assume" makes an "ass" out of "u" and "me".  Don't assume anything... 
MEASURE IT!

  Go to the drug store, or your physician or dentist, and obtain a syringe (less needle, used for 
irrigating wounds) (be sure that it is calibrated in cc, and get the biggest one you can... I got mine 
from Tri-S Science in Burbank and it holds 50 cc's.), turn the heads upside down, and fill up the 
combustion chambers (one at a time).  Be sure to get all of the air out of the syringe, and note the 
starting point for the plunger after you do so.  In the case of my syringes, the lower sealing ridge on 
the rubber piston is read against the calibrations on the barrel to obtain volume.  Because of the 
surface tension of the water, and the non-afinity of aluminum for water, you will have to scrub the 
syringe plastic nose around the edge of the chamber to wet it, and be careful not to overfill, so that 
the water runs out onto the flat part.  If you do, dump out the water, dry the combustion chamber with a 
paper towel, and start over.  It is best to do all four, and mark on the adjacent cooling fins the 
measured capacity of the chamber.  After having new guides installed and the existing valves and 
seats ground (which should have INCREASED the chamber volume, as the valves are now lower in 
the head) my combustion chambers measured 60 cc's even, all four of them.  So MEASURE!  Don't 
forget to dry thoroughly and spray in a liberal amount of WD-40 when you are done... rusty valves 
and seats are not good.

  J.J. writes further:

"    My deck height (.017 in) works out to
about 3.2cc, and the dish in my 8.0 pistons is 3cc.    "

  The dish in my KolbenSchmidt's is 4 cc's or possibly even a bit more... check this one again.

J.J. continues:

"    The engine's displacement is 1971cc, so one cylinder is 492.75cc.  If I do the math,
(492.75 + 3 + 3.2 + 63) / (3 + 3.2 + 63), then I get a compression ratio
of 8.1 : 1.  This seems acceptable, but there's one little problem.  I
was hoping to run without a head gasket, but if I were to I would have
piston/head contact almost immediately, due to head expansion.  The
minimum deck height permissible to forgo the head gasket is .026in. 
 So, it looks like I'm going to have to pull the cylinders and replace the
..010 gasket with a .030 gasket.  This should give me a deck height of
..037 in., which will safely let me run without head gasket.  According
to my calculations, though, this will drop my compression ratio to 7.74
: 1.  So, how do I get my compression ratio up without destroying my
heads?    "

  To Be Continued....
