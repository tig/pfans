This is very true. The difficult part about hopping up an air cooled 
engine is dealing with the cooling system. On a water cooled engine, it's 
simple: bigger radiator, lower temperature thermostat, trick fluids, etc. 
There isn't much that I'm aware of in the way of a bigger fan for the 
Type IV engine. Sure, you can get the 911-style fan kit (for really big 
bucks), but what else can you do? The only thing that comes to mind is 
the wise use of ceramic coatings. Porsche does this on the 911. If you up 
the CR and increase the displacement (all well and good for increasing 
power), then I would consider getting the combustion chamber, the valves 
and the exhaust ports coated. Whenever I have to do a rebuild, I'm 
planning on this. However, it would be a bad idea in my mind to coat the 
piston tops, since they need to get hot to close any gap between the 
piston and cylinder. There's a design intention there, in other words.
