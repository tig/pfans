Yes, the 1.7L (96mm NPR kit) is out of the car once again to fix
a gusher of a oil leak.  Just ast Scot Douglas, as when we were
touring one day (me in front) he thought it had started to rain
when in fact I was rustproofing his hood with specks of clean oil.

Such a gusher has to be a high-pressure side leak, and when I built
my engine I installed a melling high-volume pump and JB Weld'd all
of the oil galley plugs (to prevent ejection of said plugs).  When
I first installed the pump and torqued the cover down to spec, the
engine bound up a bit, so I back off on the torque.  Hence, I believe
oil has been escaping under load from the melling oil pump cover.

The oil pattern on the engine seems to support this fact.  One person
in the past has mentioned a similar problem with the melling pump. I
have the gears out and am going to take them to a shop to have .025"
machined off the ends of the gears as I think they are too large 
causing the binding against the cover when bolted down to spec torque
and hence the oil leak.  

Has anyone else experienced anything similar with this oil pump?
