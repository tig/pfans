-this year-? That car would -never- have been legal in street prepared,
and isn't still.

Run in DP. I belive that is where you fall anyway. There may not even be
any other competitors in that class. You could walk away with a trophy.
Ok, so there wasn't any competition to win the trophy, but you can put
it on your desk at work and impress your coworkers anyway. ;)

Yup. Have fun first and foremost. Becoming nationally competetive almost
never happens suddenly. Even the super duper hot-shoes I've known have
not achieved champion status without many years of local learning and
struggling.
