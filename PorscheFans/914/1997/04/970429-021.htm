Thanks to the replies about the engine tin paint. Obviously I didn't make
myself clear in the request. I wanted to know the "type of paint" not the
color. The safety yellow was funny!
This request concerns cleaning the engine. I have tried gunk and simple
purple. The crud still doesn't want to come off. I have looked an STP
product. The lablel says to wear gloves and eye protection. Has anyone tried
this? I think steam cleaning would be the best but there is no one local that
has  that service, just the power washer  routine.

Thanks
