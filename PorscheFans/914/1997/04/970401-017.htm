Michel:

I have nothing but good things to say about Mark Stephens.  Before I
converted my car to a six-cylinder, he did the full job on my
4-cylinder motor.  Prices were VERY reasonable, the work was REAL
sano, and even though he was moving his business from Venice Beach
to Lancaster at the time AND I dropped the engine off just before
Christmas, he finished it on time.

He wasn't doing the 103-mm cylinders back then, so I have no 
experience with them, but if he says he can make them work, I'd 
believe him.
