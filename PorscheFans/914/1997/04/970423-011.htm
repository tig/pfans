OK, guys, here goes:

First of all, please consider the following remarks to be VERY GENERAL 
and not specifically directed to 914s.  I believe most of you will find 
what I say concurs with your experience.

The first caveat is that unless I mention otherwise, the following 
remarks assume STEADY-STATE cornering.  In other words, only enough 
thrust is being applied by the drive wheels to offset road and 
aerodynamic loads on the car (the car is neither gaining nor losing 
speed).  We also assume by steady-state that the car's suspension has 
taken a "set" and is not being influenced by transient cornering or bump 
loads.

Now a little background:  movement imposed upon the suspension of a car can, 
somewhat arbitrarily, be divided into "bump" and "roll".  We define bump 
loads as those loads that force the suspension (at a given end of the 
car, either front or rear) to move simultaneously and in the same 
direction.  Your suspension would see a bump load when you travel across 
a speed bump, for instance.  Roll loads are defined as those that cause 
the suspension at one side of the car to go up while the suspension at 
the other side of the car moves down.  These loads are those typically 
seen when cornering.

For some reason (and I don't pretend to have enough insight to reason 
why) race-car engineers like the capability to tune their car's 
suspension so that they can independently adjust roll and bump 
stiffness, without one adjustment affecting the other.  Unfortunately, very 
few suspension designs allow completely independent tuning.  For 
instance, on your 914, you can increase bump stiffness by putting in a 
stiffer spring.  However, by doing so, you also increase roll stiffness, 
because the spring also resists movement of the wheel under roll 
conditions as well.  If you increase roll stiffness on your 914 (either by 
increasing the spring rate of the anti-roll-bar through a larger diameter or 
by decreasing the length of the lever which twists the bar) you hardly 
affect bump (as previously defined) stiffness at all.

Another caveat:
The astute observer will point out here that these load definitions don't 
really apply to the real world.  In fact, we hardly ever encounter a load 
which forces both wheels at one end of the car to move in unison.  
Speed bumps are pretty scarce in the life of a 914.  So, in fact, you 
WILL sense a change in the handling of your '14 if you do nothing but 
increase roll-stiffness, even if you only drive in a straight line.  As 
you travel down one of those interminably long West Texas highways, your 
left front wheel will at some point move upwards as it travels over an 
armadillo.  However, it's not a large armadillo -- at least it's not 
large enough to simultaneously deflect the right front wheel.  As a 
result, even though the car is still traveling straight, the suspension 
has seen an asymmetric deflection, and so your recently-installed 2-meter 
diameter anti-roll-bar causes you to sense every ridge in the poor 
armadillo's armor.

OK, here comes another somewhat arbitrary definition:  for the purpose of 
this conversation I'll call ROLL-STIFFNESS BIAS the difference between 
front roll-stiffness and rear roll-stiffness.  You can 
move the roll-stiffness bias to the front of the car by increasing front 
roll-stifness or by decreasing rear roll-stiffness.  You can move the 
roll-stiffness bias to the rear of the car by decreasing front 
roll-stiffness or by increasing rear roll-stiffness.

A blatant generalization:  To "tune" a car's handling, move the 
roll-stiffness bias AWAY from the end of the car that tends to slide.  If 
your car understeers (in the steady-state, remember) then move the 
roll-stiffness bias toward the rear of the car.  If your car oversteers 
(slides the rear of the car) then move the roll-stiffness bias toward the 
front of the car.

So, Mike, in answer to your question (copied below), no, it's not 
surprising that adding the anti-roll bar to the front of your car changed 
the nature of its handling from oversteer to understeer.  You moved the 
roll-stiffness bias toward the front of the car.

One more remark before you can go to your next class...  A neutral car 
may tend to oversteer when under trailing throttle (deccelerating) and may 
tend to oversteer when under leading throttle (accelerating).  Here we 
have stepped away from the "steady-state" conditions and are now assuming 
that the loads imposed on the car also include loads that will change the 
speed of the car.  Once again, a blatant simplification:  the "grip" that 
a tire has upon the road surface can be modeled as a linear function of 
the weight that it supports.  If the weight that it supports goes up, 
then it has more grip; conversely, if the weight that it supports goes 
down, then it has less grip.  So, under acceleration, the often misused 
term weight-transfer causes the rear tires to "see" more weight, thus the 
front tires will "see" less weight, thus the "grip balance" moves to the 
rear of the car and the car will tend to push or understeer.  Under 
decceleration, the "grip balance" will tend to move to the front and the 
car will tend to oversteer.  As an example of this, think of the last 
time you went into an autox gate too hot, got out of the throttle, and 
spun when the rear-end passed you up.  I'm thinking right now 
of my last autocross (whoo-hoo!).  The famous "lift-throttle oversteer" 
tendency of the 911 is present (to at least a limited extent) in every car.

Finally, throttle-induced oversteer:  The above paragraph may appear 
contradictory to those of you who drive a car that is powerful enough to 
break the drive wheels loose of the pavement.  Most cars (unfortunately, 
my 1.8 914 isn't one of them, but just you wait) are capable of doing 
this at low speeds when the engine has a large mechanical advantage over 
the wheels.  However, as speeds increase and as higher gearing forces a 
lower mechanical advantage, the engine becomes less able to break the 
drive wheels' static adhesion to the pavement.  So, yes, throttle-induced 
oversteer is fun and it can make you feel like a hero.  But don't confuse 
your car's powerful engine with its steady-state cornering tendencies.  
(As a side note, such power-induced wheel-slip will generate massive 
understeer if your car drives the front rather than the rear wheels.  In 
this case you'll just push off the road and feel silly rather than heroic.)

I hope this helps.  I realize that this is a topic that is ill-addressed 
in a simplified e-mail such as this.  I also realize that I am 
ill-prepared to discuss this topic in greater detail and I'm afraid that 
my expertise might break down upon significantly closer examination.  For 
further information, I'd suggest a number of texts on vehicle dynamics; 
Carroll Smith's books immediately spring to mind.

Good luck, and please be gentle with your flames.

Subject: RE: Oversteer


OK, so after posting my opinion on swaybar stiffness vs. over/under steer I 
read the rest of yesterday's list and see that, quite obviously, my 
experience is exactly opposite to what the esteemed Josh, Jason, and the 
others say on the subject.  I admit upfront that my experience is very 
limited and I am fairly new to setting up my car and will quickly bow to the 
greater knowledge of the 'old hands'.

So, now that I've displayed (and admitted) to my ignorance, anyone want to 
speculate on why adding a factory 16mm swaybar to a car that previously 
didn't have one (setup with Bils and 140lb Welts) caused my car to display 
more understeer than oversteer?  (In all fairness, I should add that at the 
same time I added the swaybar I also replaced the front bushings, tierods, 
and ball joints.)

Thanks for any wisdom, opinions, and guesses.
