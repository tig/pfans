I know someone with a 3.0 coversion with CIS and the only visable cut I
saw was a small notch out of the trunk/engine wall at the top. I do
belive that the torsion bars for the engine lid needed to go too as well
as the latch, but this one has pins for the engine lid.

Uh Dave, what do you mean about "relatively few cars...". Try every VW
made from the early 80's to about '88 and most Audi's as well. I'd say
that there are quite a few of those cars out there. And I'm sure that
there are more than that. Bosch is the biggest FI maker in Europe, and
CIS was as common as water for quite a while. Don't worry about not
having a good depth of knowledge out there for CIS equiped cars, the
knowledge base is plenty deep. Sure DME is a better system, but it's
also more expensive. But don't sell CIS short...

I dunno Dave, are you feeling ok?
