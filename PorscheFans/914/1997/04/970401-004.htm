It is a common mis-conception that the beam type torque wrenches are less 
accurate than the "click" types.  In fact, they tend to be more 
accurate since they rely upon the spring-rate of the steel that forms the 
lever arm.  The spring-rate of the alloy is well-defined and easy to 
control during the manufacturing process.  The click-type, however, uses 
moving parts, which are resultingly less easy to control and maintain 
within original tolerances over the life of the device.

So, pick your tool.  The beam types are simple and tend to maintain their 
calibration longer.  The click types are more convenient to use (they 
have the ratcheting head) but they are unavoidably a MECHANISM and like 
other mechanisms (your 914's valve-train, for example) they wear and drop 
their tolerances.  Is this a bad thing?  Not necessarily; just be aware 
of it and fix it periodically.

Good luck.
