You can do a few things with what you have to solve your oversteer problem.

1. Change the rake of the car
2. Adjust tire pressures
3. Adjust your front swaybar

All are free! I'd probably just adjust the front bar assuming the rake of
the car is right. Remember if you've lowered the car quite a bit you may
want to shorten the bump rubber on your front struts so you can maintain
some shock stroke.
