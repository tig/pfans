Don't know if this would work with the T4 engine, just an idea.  When I did
my T1 engine I used parts from Gene Berg.  He sold replacements for the
standard circlips that were basically snap rings that were the correct size
for the T1 pistons.  Install and remove with snap ring pliers.

You might be able to find a standard size snap ring at a FLAPS that would
fit the T4.  If you do let the list know.

Subject:  Reusing wrist-pin circlips




The last time I did a top-end rebuild on my car, I reused the wrist-pin
circlips.  This time, I caught a line in the Haynes manual that
recommended non doing this.  As I was ordering some gaskets, etc. from
GPR yesterday, I asked for some new circlips, and they said that not
only do they not have any, they don't know of a way to get new ones
without buying a complete set of P&Cs!  I spoke with Jim at GPR, and he
said that in the 15 years he's been working on 914 motors, if he wasn't
replacing the pistons and cylinders, he never replaced the circlips.  He
said that as long as the groove that they snap into was clean and in
good shape, that I'd be fine.  I'm still a little weary, though.  He
said I wasn't the only one, and said that some racers buy after market
"spiral" circlips that snap in really easy, but just barely come out at
all.  Has anyone on the list reused their circlips?  Has anyone heard of
any disasters resulting from this reuse?  Does anyone know of a supplier
of new circlips (GPR does have used ones for sale) if reusing them
really is a terrible thing?

Thanks again!
