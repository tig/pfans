Hey All,

	Ok, here's a good one. It appears to be spontaneous vapor locking. I
have never had this problem before and have no idea why it would have
occured now.

	I am seeing big bubbles in the hard plastic fuel line in the engine
compartmnent. The car has plenty of power but will intermittently just
loose power, completely. Zero, zip, zilch. Like the throttle is closed.
Gas pedal doesn't do a thing, and then a couple of coughs and a few
backfires and the car runs great for a few more minutes and then the
same thing. What is going on? This has never happened to me before, and
I'm perplexed. Basically, the only thing in the FI system that _is_
original is the brain and the fuel pump and regulator. The rest is
either rebuilt or new. Oil temps when the car is doing this aren't even
up to 180 degrees, and I've had the sucker much hotter than that barely
two weeks ago (didn't turn on the oil cooler fan soon enough).

	Recently the car sat for about a week under a cover while it was snowed
in. Could this be a moisture problem? Even after a 1/2 hour of driving
it would do this and only once the engine started warming up. 

	What could cause this sudden change in the cars behavior? The only
other variable is that after I recently tuned the car up and leaned it
out for the smog test, and afterwards I tweaked it up 2 clicks and
richened the mixture by just a little. I seriously doubt that this could
have done it, but it does behave almost like it's flooding out
intermittently. Could I have a bad brain? Hmm, an intermittent head temp
connection?

	So, what do y'all think?

-Josh2
