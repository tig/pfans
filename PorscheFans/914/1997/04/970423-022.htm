  I've got one, but I hope I'm wrong... Manifold Pressure Sensor... Try getting out the ol' handy-dandy 
vacuum pump / gauge and see if the diaphram holds a vacuum, or better yet, substitute a known 
good one.
  As I said, I hope that it's something less expensive....

                                                  Good Luck,
                                                  Jim T.
