The main seal on the fan end of my crankshaft went bad last Summer.  I
couldn't tell where the leak was because the oil was being blown all over
(and through the sheet metal) by the fan.  It was a MAJOR leak and required
a $5.00 seal to fix it.  Wouldn't account for your power loss though...

Good luck.
