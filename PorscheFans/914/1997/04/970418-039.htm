Howdy everyone, 

 Not too long ago I ordered GT flares and got a buddy deal of $1135.00.
I had told a few of you about ordering the flares and was told that I
would only receive 3 flares and the 4th (left rear) would come later and
with a different finish. Well sure enough, 3 flares came in and the left
rear was missing, but was told the left rear was coming from the factory
and not some unknow location out side the factory. 
Today I was told the 4th flare was in , so I stoped what I was doing and
went to get it. The left rear flares was in a factory box from Reno and
had the same black paint, dealer parts sticker and looker just like the
other 3 flares.

 So is the story an old wives tail ?? or did the factory run out of
flares at one time ?? and had to beat a few more left rears out ??

 Are the flares I ordered concidered NOS ?? have they really been
sitting on a shelf in the fatherland all these years or dose the factory
still make them when needed ??

 Thanks , 

  Don

 PS. Anyone from So Cal going to the 914 club reunion in  Solvang in May
??
