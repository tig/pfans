   Hello! I'm new to the list and wanted to hear some of your opinions about my
pending 914-6 3.0 or 3.2 conversion.

   It seems that many of the mail order companies sell the Bursch 914-6
headers. Has anyone had any experience with these? How do they compare to the
other brands out there? If I use these headers, is it possible to use
SuperTraps, or will they stick out too far? Would it be better to use a stock,
or Bursch, muffer anyways?

   I've followed the recent thread concerning the bar vs. original mounting
style for the engine, and believe I am going to use a "bar". How do the
different brands compare (i.e. AA's "Quick Six", MotorMeister's, Patrick
MotorSport's, GPR's)? They all appear to be pretty high quality, should I
simply opt for the least expensive?

   I understand I will need four oil lines for my original 914-6 oil tank.
Which are they, and why are they so hard to find? Where can I look, and how
much should I expect to pay for them? (My only option now is Otto's at $450
for the set).

   Has anyone had any experience with Kennedy Engineering Products (name?).
They quoted me a price of $500 for a 9"in clutch and flywheel ring that will
mate my 901 and a 3.0. Do the 3.0 and 3.2 use the same flywheel/clutch?

   Is GPR (German Parts & Resto)'s price of $425 the best I can do for sheet
metal? Should I wait until I can find the original tin, or is repro ok?

Thanks for any help!
