	I've seen a 914/6 2.7 with CIS, and photos of a 914/6 3.07 with CIS.
	The guy with the 3.0 modified the airbox for clearance.  He took a
saw or dremel or some such to it, cut out the part that interfered, and glued
in some plastic to close the hole that made.  Dimension was too hard to tell
from the photo, and I don't remember it all that well anymore...
	The guy with the 2.7 cut the bulkhead between the engine compartment
and the firewall.  Not a lot, I think it was the top 2 or 3".  He had to get
rid of the rear deck lid torsion bars (they run along there) and he used a
ski pole to hold the rear trunk open.  He also had to get rid of the latch
for the engine compartment lid, so he removed the torsion bars for that, and
put a long coil spring on the grille-work to hold the lid closed.
	He had welded in a piece that went straight up from where he cut the
sheet-metal, so I don't think the strength was compromised in any way.  It
might not have been even if he hadn't put that in, but I think he wanted to
make sure the engine and trunk were separated.

	Well, I've always thought the 3.2/DME combination was a lot better
than the 3.0/CIS (or the anything/CIS) combination, myself.  In addition to
having more power (and made more efficiently), most cars nowadays use an
EFI system similar to DME.  There are probably a lot more people who under-
stand DME than CIS anymore, since relatively few cars ever used CIS.
	Then again, the 3.2 might have too much power.  (Did I actually say
that?)
