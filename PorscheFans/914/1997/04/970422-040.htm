Greetings 914-er's!

  Jeff Lorentzen asks:

   I'm going to have to go out on a limb and disagree with Dave D.  That's always a risky business, 
because Dave's usually right, but this time I have the advantage of him;  I happen to have my sensor 
out of the engine where I can put my hands on it readily, and it screws into an 8mm nut from my 
hardware assortment just fine.  So... my guess is M8 fine pitch, about .360" (9mm) long.  The hole in 
the head is about .6" deep (15mm).
  I have my cylinder head temp gauge sensor mounted under the Temp II sensor (or I did until 
tear-down, and will again) and it works just fine.  I cut a slit in the rubber grommet in the engine 
sheetmetal for the Temp Semsor II wire to accomodate the molex connector on the end of my temp 
gauge sensor (VDO) which eases installation.
  The VDO paperwork suggests mounting the thing under a spark plug, but the Temp Sensor II 
location sure beats having to fish around to line the gauge sensor up every time you change plugs!

  Hope this helps.
                                                  Regards,
                                                  Jim T.
