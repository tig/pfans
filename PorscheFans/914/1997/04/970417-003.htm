  Don't worry about a single fin on the jug.

  Where did you pick this .026in number from?  Do you have some kind of
  wild cam in your case?  When I was rebuilding my 1.7L from the ground
  up and this list was run by Stan Hanks, he instisted (during numberous
  debates on what mods I should make to my engine) that you can run a
  914 with a deck height of 0, zilch, nada.

  I put the NPR 96mm kit on my 1.7 and never bothered to measure the 
  deck height and compute my CR - since I've got the engine out now
maybe
  it's worth it to check it out.  If I do, I'll try to remember to let 
  you know what mine is.

  Careful measurement will tell if you need oversized rings (although
  I still have to buck-up the $$$ for the fancy and accurate devices
  required for such blue-printing).
