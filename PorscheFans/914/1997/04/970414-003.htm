Dan:

I put a 911S clutch in my 914-6 conversion, but it couldn't handle 
the torque and started slipping after 15,000 miles or so.  I replaced 
it with a puck clutch (maybe from Kennedy?  I forget...) and it no 
longer slips.  On the other hand, it chatters a lot and is a bitch to 
drive in stop-and-go traffic.

If I were keeping my car, I'd probably put another 911S clutch in 
it and just plan on replacing it every 15-20K miles... The 911S 
clutch has a much nicer feel.

Of course, if your car's engine isn't very powerful, the 911S clutch 
will probably last a lot longer than it did in my car.
