The tubing may be slightly expensive (about 1$ per foot, depending on 
diameter), but the connectors are very cheap, and very common.

Granted, copper can work harden and become brittle, but if your car is 
flexing that much, then something else is wrong. Also, copper tubing will 
change dimension as it heats and cools, so allowance has to be made in 
the installation for that. 

But, rubber (covered by stainless steel braiding) lines will deteriorate 
with age (crack, etc), and with that braiding in place, you can't see the 
rubber tubing very well. I'm sure they've got good rubbers these days (!) 
that resist hot oil, but I think copper would last longer under these 
circumstances. Also, a braided line rubbing against a body part will come 
untangled and fail. I think the bottom line is to be thorough in installing
whichever type of line you use.
