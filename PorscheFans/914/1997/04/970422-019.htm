JJ:

Pegasus Racing (you can get a catalog by calling 800 688-6946) sells
a range of Mocal thermostats for between $38 and $80.  I'm guessing
from your "popping the lines off" comment that you use rubber hose
that's just pushed onto the oil-cooler fittings; if that's true and
you're using 1/2-inch hose, you can buy their Part Number 1225-1/2,
which costs only $37.99.
