Hi there,

>  Here in So Cal it was Porsche swap meet time this Sunday, the turn out
>was great and the was some very nice 914's, 914-6's, and a few very nice
>6 conversions. The parts area was good too, but not too much in the line
>of nice 914 parts. I meet or ran into several listers, Glenn S was
>selling parts and scored a nice set of 2.0L alloys with lugs. Son N was
>shopping and scored a very nice RX-7 comp oil cooler and dropped off his
>BMW calipers to have them machined. Jeff L was shopping but dont think

Just a clarification:  the "very nice RX-7 comp oil cooler" I bought
was from Don.  I don't know the diff between an oil cooler and
a wine cooler, but I must admit, it looks very nice...  I saw 2
other RX-7 coolers for sale both asked for $200, one was in 
nice cond, the other was slightly more used.

I also picked up some extra spares and found some SS screws 
for my spare mirrors (one w/ a broken glass the other
has a tiny dent on the housing).  So if you need a screw or
2, check the yellow pages under "escort service", oops,
my mind wandered a bit... :-)

> All in all it was a Good Porsche swap meet day !!

agreed...

Now if I haven't lost you yet...  I bought 2 gallons of
Swepco gear lube, went home, changed my friend's car 
no problem.  Then we worked on my car.  Whoever tightened
the plug on my car must've on a rage.  It won't come
out.  I looked in Haynes, it says 15 - 18lb of torque.  I've
managed to partially strip the hex part of the plug and
it still won't come out.  Then my friend decided to remove the
other plug nearby the drain plug (to the lower left of the 
drain plug, facing the ground) w/out telling me. A spring
and ball bearing dropped out.  He shoved them back in.  I don't
know what those things are for and if he's done any harm to
the tranny.  Haynes didn't explain much about those parts.
Pls tell me that the tranny is ok.  I can't tell if the
tranny is behaving any differently but I'm kinda fearful
of the unknown...

BTW, his car w/ a short shift kit shifted like a worn out
meat grinder.  The drain plug was full of gunk and the old
oil was pretty ugly.  After Swepco, it felt like the gears
are teflon coated.  Neat stuff...

Also, I found a set of Mahle P/C 94mm. How do I know if
they're for the 2.0?
