I'm getting terribly confused.  Not one person I've spoken with has told
me the same thing as the other.  One member on the list recommends no
cylinder base gasket, and a .030 head gasket.  Mark Stephens recommends
..030 cylinder base gasket with plenty of sealant, and no head gasket.  A
mechanic at a local shop here recommends no head gasket, and 2 .010
cylinder base gaskets.  I've heard that these engines can run 0 deck
height, a little less than .025, and no less than .026.  I, like most
people on this list, and simply looking for the most reliable power as
possible.  If I were to try and boil down these answers, this is what
I've come up with:

1.  I don't want my piston to hit the head, and it sounds like a deck
height of anything less than about .025 will do that.

2.  I want good seals everywhere, but the concern seems to be about the
over-use of sealant.  Thus, a very liberal amount between the case and
cylinder seems like the best bet.

3.  I want to avoid any problems with pinging at the higher compression,
so I feel that running no head gasket with a cylinder base gasket(s)
between .020 and .030 should do it.

Now, if I rebuild my motor based on the above 3 statements, am I asking
for trouble?

Thanks again,
