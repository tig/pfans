The impression that I'm getting is that placement of the shims doesn't
affect deck height, but it does affect performance.  The mechanic that I
spoke with out here said that none of the VWs (or 911s, if I remember
correctly) used head gaskets, only the 914.  Bill at Mark Stephens said
that this was a mistake on Porsche's part, and they (Porsche) recalled
the head gasket.  If I am to believe these two people, then it would
seem that shims under the cylinder (providing a deck height of at least
..026) and no head gasket are the ideal way to run.  Several people on
the list, however, have said that running without a head gasket would be
a mistake.  I have a feeling that I'm going to end up running with no
head gasket due to a point that Mark Stephens made.  They claim to have
much better success with high compression engines and no head gaskets
than they do with low compression engines with head gaskets.  Now, maybe
Mark Stephens is doing something wrong, but I can't see them lying about
a Porsche factory recall.
  If Porsche is willing to admit that they made a design error, and a
professional engine builder is telling me that I should acknowledge that
error to receive better performance and reliability, then I really can't
argue too much.

Not to be argumentative, Jim, but why is this the ideal way to put it
together?  I am continuously hearing just the opposite.  I do not,
however, trust the estimation of combustion chamber displacement, and
will probably perform my own measurements this weekend.  My question is;
won't the surface tension of the water produce a "dome" on the surface,
destroying the accuracy of my measurement?  What if I placed a sheet of
plastic wrap (or a piece of clear plastic) over the surface of the head,
and filled the water through a hole?

My mistake.  I hadn't thought that there was a deck for the piston to
hit, and based on my terrible memory, assumed the combustion chamber
immediately "curves in" towards the spark plug hole.  I just figured
that the edge of the piston would hit this curvature as it entered the
combustion chamber.

>Dave Darling says that the Euro 914's were placcarded for higher octane 
fuel.

Fortunately, everyone I've talked to locally said that due to our
elevation (~5400ft), I can safely run regular with no problems at all.
I do believe that at sea level, you will have a problem.

I apologize if I appear repetitive, I'm just trying to clear things up
in my own mind.  I'm learning a lot about these engines right now, and
because I'm trying to do the whole job on my own, I really don't want to
screw it up.

Thanks again.
