Hi,

After the Pomona show I started trying to track down the various electrical
quirks I have and need some info.

Can anyone tell me (for a 73 2.0L)  what the relays are on the back of the
fuse panel.  My Haynes manual picture doesn't match mine and it would help
when I try to trace things.  If I unscrew the fuse panel and then swing it
down, there are 3 round relays going from left to right (in those rubber
type sockets).  Then a metal case relay? that clips to the metal fuse
panel.  Behind that (toward the front of the car)  is the buzzer.   The
flasher relay is up under the dash.

What are those three round relays and the metal case relay?


Problems I'm tracking:

Horn doesn't work. Don't have power at horn.  Need to find the horn relay
shown in Haynes wiring for 73 USA model.

Buzzer seems to be constantly on.  Right now the #11 fuse (for interior
lights, seat belt sensors, door switches) is pulled.  If I have the key in
on position and put in fuse the buzzer starts going.  I had door open but
pushed in door switch, didn't help.   At least part of the seatbelt sensor
system works (the sensors in the seats are disconnected which shouldn't
matter based on the wiring diagram).  The Seat Belt light comes on when key
is on, goes out if I hook up the drivers seatbelt.


The passanger side turn signals don't work.  I posted about this awhile
back but just getting the time to do serious tracking.  I have good bulbs,
did a quick cleaning of the contacts and the grounding points near
headlight buckets and back by the engine relay plate but didn't help so
need to track the wiring.  The exact symptoms are: drivers side works fine,
have key in 'on', emergency brake is on so the red brake light is flashing
and can hear the turn signal relay clicking with it.  Switch on left
signals, get the indicators flashing in the tach and the actual turn lights
flash.  Switch to passenger side,  relay starts buzzing, emergency brake
light and the tach turn indicators go out.  Same thing if pull the
emergency flasher switch.

Could be a wire, could still be a ground. Want to start tracking wires from
the dash.  Does anyone know where the actual grounding points are with
reference to the Haynes manual diagram?  It just indicates the ground
points.  I can guess that the ones for front headlights are the ones near
the headlight buckets, etc.  but would help to know for sure on all the
ground points.


Thanks,
Jeff
