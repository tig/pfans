It all depends on the type of copper you use.  I know of ACR,L, K and M.  
Wall thickness varies: for 7/8 OD tube; .045, .045, .035, .032 
respectively.  the tubing has to meet ASTM specification B-280 which I 
don't have handy.  Maybe someone has a copy and could back this up with 
additional facts.  With these various wall thicknesses, I would think the 
different type all have different pressure capabilities.  your general 
garden variety of copper tubing is usually in the M and K types.  When we 
use tubing for hvac work it is always ACR type.  the ACR type is the same 
physical characteristics of type L but has been dehydrated, capped and 
nitrogen filled.  At least it is filled until un-capped and used.

Josh is correct in his statement about prices.  Copper is by far cheaper 
to use for our hvac industry.  Yes, it is softer than the SS braiding 
over the rubber lines but if run where rock and debris damage isn't a 
concern it should be more than useable.

I ran solid aluminum tubing from the rear of my race car toward the front 
of the car.  From those solid lines I used Aeroquip for connections to 
the engine and cooler.  This allows flexiblity for the engine and 
vibration dampening for the cooler.  I have not had a problem with sither 
as of yet; 5 years.  If I had to do it over again, I would have run 
Aeroquip through the passenger side heater tunnel to hide the lines.  
Fishing solid tubing through the tunnel just wasn't/isn't feesible.  
Presently, they run alone the inside of the car between the passenger 
seat and rocker panel tunnel area.  Of course, I don't take many 
passengers so someone getting "hot" hands isn't a concern for me.
