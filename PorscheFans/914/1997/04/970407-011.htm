	The wires to the Manifold Pressure Sensor.  There are a couple of
things you could do:  AA sells the whole connector bit (I think even the
plastic plug comes with) with electrical connectors with the wire pigtails.
You might be able to find some used, off an old dead wiring harness.  The
electrical connector (female spade connector with a barb to hold it into
the plastic plug) is supposedly still made and sold by Wurth in one of their
Jumbo Electrical Assortments.
	There's a good chance that the connector, or a close cousin, is
still available from VW.  But it will take a lot of time to figure out just
which connector is the right one.  To find the larger version, I begged my
local dealer's parts dept and they let me sit in front of their "things
electrical" fische for about two hours, looking at all the connectors.  I
don't know of any dealers that will do that to sell you four 80-cent parts.
One of the guys from Bauer Porsche in Oakland told me that they had a guy
who knew what all the connectors were, and would sell me some.  I have not
yet made the time to check this out.
	BTW, if you find out what the part number (ANY part #) for that
electrical connector is, please tell me!
