I am a recent subscriber to the 914 mail list... and have a couple of questions.

I have the opportunity to buy a 1972 914... a car I bought new in 1972 and
sold in 1978... which the present owner has owned since 1978.

Assuming it has had reasonably good care and maintenance I would like
opinions from the mail list subscribers as to the fair value of this car today.

What sources can I find (Hemmings, et al) that provide values... and web
sites if they are on the Internet.

The other question...the car must be shipped/driven/hauled across the
country... from California to Chicago, for example. I would appreciate names
and phone numbers of reliable auto haulers... any experiences re: costs to
ship?? I am considering a one way flight and renting a U-Haul-it van/truck
to haul the car via trailer. Any experiences shipping, comments, costs, etc.
of other reliable way of delivery would be appreciated. 

I will answer questions and replies... which can be either via this 914 mail
list or privately. Thanks...
