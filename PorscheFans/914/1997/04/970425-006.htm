Like most companies, Vellios and PM will have a mixed bag
of reviews....

I'm using a Vellios magnetic speedo pickup for use with 915
tranny conversions in a mid-engined car....according to my
tranny guy it installed with ease and works like a charm.

I know 2 guys who have the Vellios side-shift conversion pieces.
One guy loves it....the other says it's OK.  Both are track
cars.

Vellios parts seem to be pretty high-quality but usually very
expensive.

Through the grapevine (probably here), I've heard of a couple
of PM motor mounts breaking....perhaps the chrome moly
wasn't welded properly.  Chrome moly is "cool" ('cause race
cars use it it must be "cool"), but you've really got to know
what you're doing when welding it, otherwise it'll fail.

A friend of mine used a "generic" quick-6 motor mount and
he actually bent it!!!  He had another one made up and he
bent that too!!!  This was with a 3.2 motor in a pure race car.
He had a 3rd made with lots of reinforcements and that one
worked great.

I think his first two bars were made with 1.5" square tubing
with a 3/16" wall thickness.

Anyhow....back to PM.  I've got their cable shifter for installing
a 915 trans in a 914.  The quality of the machine work seems
good....although the gold anodizing on the machined parts
is fading rapidly.  The cable was actually a few inches too
long for me so the cables had to be routed in a less than
ideal fashion.  It seems to work OK....but shifting is tough
due to the incredibly short throw (loss of lever advantage).

I suppose the short throw could contribute to missed shifts
if you are careless....

....and the shifter is pretty ugly....one day I'll make a leather
boot for it and build a new armrest contraption to hide the large
cables....oh yeah....the cables are MASSIVE.  I don't think
they'll ever break.

My order from PM was missing some flywheel bolts I asked
for....but they sent me the missing parts right away and
apologized.

My order from Vellios was delayed.....I ordered the speedo
pickup from George himself and he forgot about it or
didn't write it down or something.....a phone call a week
later resulted in an apologetic secretary sending me the
$75 part via Fed Ex with $10 off for my trouble.

So both places acted rapidly to fix their mistakes which
is important to me.

Oh yeah....DON'T DO THE 915 TRANNY CONVERSION!!!!

Good luck!
