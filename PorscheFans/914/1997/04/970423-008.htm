Chip, I've got exactly the same setup except I've got a stock 16mm swaybar 
up front.  I've only autocrossed once since adding the swaybar, but I find 
the car fairly neutral, leaning a little toward understeer.  I ran all last 
year with everything the same, but no front swaybar at all and I used to 
have too much  oversteer.  This (limited) experience would lead me to 
believe that a bigger or stiffer anti-sway bar in the front causes 
understeer.  If this is true then you would need to either set the sway bar 
to a LESS stiff setting or else add stiffer rear springs in order to 
decrease oversteer.

And of course, if you've got a good strong 2.0, you can induce oversteer 
under just about any condition.  Are you running on street tires or 
autocross/road race tires?
