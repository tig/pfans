I just thought I'd share this with everyone incase someone else decides
to measure their deck height anytime soon.  The first time I measured
mine, I simply slid feeler gauges along the edge of the piston until, by
my best estimation, they were flush with the top of the cylinder.  I did
this in three different places, with a .010 in. base basket in place.
In each of the three places, I measured .017 in.  I called GPR to order
some new gaskets, and spoke with Dave.  He was adamant that I had
screwed up, and that my deck height should actually be larger than I had
measured.  In fact, he wouldn't even sell the gaskets to me until I went
home an re-measured the deck height with a straight edge!  Well, in the
interim I had take the top end completely apart, so last night I
reassembled one rod, piston, and cylinder (without a base gasket).  I
measured again, assuming I'd get .007 in., and sure enough, I did.  So,
I tried the straight edge method.  I simply took a long, flat-stemmed
screwdriver, and placed it along the edge of the cylinder and began
shoving gauges under it.  Well, I'll be damned!  In all three places,
..018 in. was the largest that would slide under it.  So, it looks like
with the base gasket, my deck height was .028 in., not .017 in.!  Being
the substantial difference that it is, I'd thought I'd pass this along.
Gotta' go call Dave back and order my gaskets!
