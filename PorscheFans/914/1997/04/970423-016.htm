I'm a little to the 'right' of Josh on this one.

Porsche uses .059" wall aluminum [not 6061, there is a special grade
of malleable tubing that is used for aluminum hydraulic lines --
and can be bent on standard tube bending equipment] tubing in the
construction of its oil coolers and lines.

Earle M. Jorgensen metal suppliers carry a range of 6061 inch sizes that are
suitable for staright lines. You can also get lines made at any shop that
specializes in tubing fab. The metric stuff is MUCH harder to find; if you
know of a source, I want to know.

[flame on]
Given the [relatively] low rupture strength of copper lines, and not knowing
WHAT you're buying in terms of grade [which are, standard, 'K', 'L' and
'M' in hardware stores -- does Mark's have anything to say about
that?] I wouldn't even consider copper lines in a
setting that could cause several thousand dollars worth of damage.

Any of you folks ever tried DRIVING through a puddle of hot oil? I have,
and have knee shrapnel to help me remember the experience [on a motorcyle,
probably behind some idiot who chose to use a low rupture strength material
to convery hot oil!]. You're not out there alone, folks. Sheesh.
[flame off]

Also check Scoggin Enterprises [I'll post the number later] for a
complete catalog selection of tube and hose fittings that are suitable for
oil and fuel service, as well as application notes about what to use where.

Just an opinion.
