    My only first-hand experience with Vellios' conversion parts was
    with his "Quick-Six" engine mounting bar... Mine broke in half
    after less than 10,000 miles.

    There are a lot of people using his bar and I've never heard
    that they have a reputation for breaking, so I'm willing to
    believe that this was an isolated incident.

    Vellios DOES have a reputation for being expensive, though...
    Here on the mailing list, in fact, his name is frequently spelled
    "Vellio$".  Patrick Motorsports' engine-mount bar is, I think, a
    little cheaper than Vellios', and it looks real pretty.

    I have no personal experience with the Patrick Motorsports
    conversion parts.  However, there's another option that you
    haven't mentioned:  Real Porsche parts.

    After you buy an engine bar from someone (Vellios or Patrick or
    whomever), you'll still need an oil tank, halfshafts, wheel hubs,
    brakes, transmission intermediate plate, etc.  Rather than buying
    aftermarket replicas, see if you can get the Factory pieces...
    They ARE available, the prices are often LESS than what you'd
    pay for a replica, and the quality may be better.

    Just an idea...
