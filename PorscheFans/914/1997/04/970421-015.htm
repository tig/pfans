Interrnally patching a radial tire is perfectly safe. For a street tire.
Personally, I have had no problem with patched tires, and have had many
done over the years. If the limit was indeed as low as 65mph and it was
fully expected that the car would be travelling _at_ that limit, I'd
toss the tire and get a new one. Now that is probably what the tire shop
wants you to do. And as for the 65 mph limit, they can't legal tell you
to exceed the speed limit, so they say 65 mph. 

Now, race tires? I don't think I'd trust my life to a patched tire on a
race track. 65 mph on a freeway is one thing, 100 mph on a track is
another story.
