Mine is sitting off right now, brazed some cracks around coil mount.  I
have carbs so less to remove (switching back to FI soon).  I also had to
remove the dist. and really loosen the front tin, across front of fan
(would have been easier if I removed it but didn't ).

I just painted with black BBQ paint, this is a quick fix for now.  I
eventually will be pulling engine to do some work. Thinkig about having the
tin powder-coated then.

Is is possible to remove the passenger side engine shroud while the engine
is in the car? I presume that I must unplug the injectors, take off the
coil and intake manifold. Has anyone done this?. The next question is in
regard to paint. I am not into compression ratio's but am interested in
putting my car in excellent condition. What kind/brand of paint would be
original to use on the valve covers, lower sheet metal, drive axles, etc.

Thanks
Keith Schultz
