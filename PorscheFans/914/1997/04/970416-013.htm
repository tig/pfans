Dave:

The 4-cylinder 914 motors redline at (I think) 5600 RPM, so the 
rev-limiter should be set right around there.

You can buy the rev-limiting rotors preset to just about any
limit... When Jerry buys a replacement, he should make sure it's
calibrated for the correct speed.

By the way, someone characterized the rev-limiting rotor's 
response time (1-2 Hz) as "fast".  Actually, it's significantly 
slower than most electronic limiters.

This is a GOOD thing (assuming that the rev-limit isn't set right at
to the point where the engine will explode)... Many electronic
limiters are so sensitive that they will cut the spark to one
cylinder, then allow it to fire on the next, and continue in this
pattern for as long as the keep your foot on the throttle.

If you run the engine for any amount of time on one of those
electronic limiters, two bad things happen:  1) gasoline washes down 
the sides of half your cylinders, cleaning them of oil and 
incrementally increasing wear, and 2) those cylinders load up with 
fuel and don't re-fire cleanly when you get off the limiter.

A mechanical limiter (like the rotor) tends to cut the spark more 
randomly, so no one cylinder (or set of cylinders) runs for very long 
without a spark.

Those of us who write rev-limiter software for a living and CARE
about what happens to our end-users' engines generally try to either
cut the spark pseudo-randomly or cut it in a fixed pattern that will
tend to distribute the missed spark among all the cylinders equally.

It's always a compromise, though... For instance, cutting the spark
from every third cylinder works well on 2-, 4-, and 8-cylinder
engines, but it's a problem on 6- and 12-cylinder motors. Cutting
every seventh spark distributes well over all engines, but it doesn't
limit engine speed very well.  Cutting every fifth spark works for 
all engines except Audi 5-cylinders and the V-10s in some Chrysler 
products, and usually slows the engine enough to keep it at the 
rev-limit.  To protect against the case where cutting one spark out 
of five ISN'T enough to keep the engine from over-revving, there's 
usually a failsafe that kicks in and cuts more sparks if the engine 
keeps accelerating.
