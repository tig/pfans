Ok, I checked out your page Jeff. It's a good overview, I like it.

Just for variety, I'll give a quick summary of my car and my wish-list.

Got now:

Koni adjustable shocks w/adjustable rear perch and 150# rear springs.
- corner balancing does make a difference. As well as the adjustable
ride height.
slotted strut towers for incresed negative camber.
Carefull alignment.
-this I can't stress enough. A bad alignment will trash even the best
car.
Stock front torsion bars.
19mm adjustable weltmeister front sway bar. 
-I have not found the need to go full stiff for autoxing. Your setup
looks like it would tend to understeer quite a bit.
Poly bushings all four corners.
205/50-15 BFG R1 tires on fuchs alloys.
19mm master cylinder with SS brake lines. Carbon brakes.
5-point harness and harness bar.
smaller steering wheel.
Bursh exhaust.

Wish-list.

BIGGER WHEELS AND FLARES. I'm looking at either 225/50-15 or 215/50-13
if they'll fit over the brakes. The 13s would give be a distinct gearing
advantage and that's worth quite a bit. For autox, weight is my primary
concern so light wheels are key. 
Competition seat. This'll happen soon.
A good tuned header and muffler setup. This is worth a few ponies. Up to
15 is the system is well tuned.
Stiffer suspension. This is a package deal however. sway bars front and
rear, stiffer spring rates front and rear and a limmited slip, Torsen
preferably. This is a big ticket item and may not pay off so it's got
lower priority.
SP legal motor with custom 95.2mm pistons (if made properly they _are_
legal), decked heads, balanced everything, lightened flywheel,
electromotive or kugel-fischer FI with independent throttle bodies and
port matched out to an inch.

There's my wish list for now, I know there's more though.

-Josh2
