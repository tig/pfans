Hi gang,

I've just received my 914 CBC book, and there is a picture showing how the
GT oil cooler lines were run past the driver's left heel.  I want to
install an aux oil cooler to keep my freeway temps down.  

I plan to run a spare stock oil cooler in the right front fender well, just
below the turn signal bucket.  I figure air from the horn grille area,
through holes in the body, and out in front of the wheel would work.  I'll
have to make some louvered muck covers, of course, and weld fittings onto
the cooler, and perhaps a drain plug?

I want to run the oil lines through the right side rocker panels, through
the passenger footwell, into the trunk, and out to the cooler.  So, the
question is,

   What do I use for the hard lines?  1/2" copper plumbing pipe?  Or steel?
 Or can (should?) I use rubber oil hoses all the way?

TIA, 

- Brian
