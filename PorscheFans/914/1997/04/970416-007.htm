Filip,

The door shell had probably been replaced as part of a repair, and the
old mechanism was put into the new shell.

If the repair was done after 1974, the new style shell was "better and
cheaper"
than the old style, and it was received from the factory without the
window
mechanism.

Just a guess,
Gary.
