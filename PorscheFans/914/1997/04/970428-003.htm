	I decided to tackle to chore of measuring my combustion chamber and
piston dish volumes this weekend.  Boy, I hadn't realized how
tool-deficient I was!  I was able to find a graduated syringe in my
local grocery store's pharmacy.  I bought a piece of Plexiglas to cut a
circle out of, only to realize that I didn't have a saw.  So, I bought a
hack-saw and a file to clean things up.  Then, I needed to drill a hole
in the circle, but didn't have a drill!  So, in an attempt to keep the
costs of this project down, I bought a plain-jane Black & Decker drill
(it's not even cordless).  Now I've got a nice ~97mm circle with a hole
in the center.  I figured I'd tackle the dish in the piston first.  I
used brake fluid for my measurements, but could not prevent the fluid
from seeping out of the dish and under the Plexiglas!  Since I have no
idea how much fluid was escaping the chamber, I really don't know how
much fluid was needed to fill the dish, but I figure it was about 3ccs.
Any recommendations for getting this more accurately?
	Next, I tackled the combustion chamber.  There was a little fluid
seepage here, but not very much, and I figure at worst it totaled 1cc.
I measured it twice, initially coming up with 58.5 cc, and the second
time coming up with 57.8 cc.  Now, as far as I can tell, it's just about
impossible to error on the short side, right?  I can see plenty of ways
to come up with a figure larger than the actual value (seepage under the
Plexiglas, fluid spillage between the jar and the head, surface tension
in the drilled hole, etc), but I can't see how the combustion chamber
volume could actually be larger than what I measured.  So, if these
figures are accurate (I assume about 58cc is closest to actual value),
and the values that others have told me are typical (61cc - 63cc), then
I'm substantially short.  Would this imply my heads have been "fly-cut"?
 Does it mean someone filled material into the combustion chamber, and
if so, would I be able to tell with a visual inspection?
	Last question (for now, of course)... do I need to be concerned about
the corrosive nature of brake fluid in my combustion chamber, and how
should I clean it without causing other problems?

Thanks a lot,
