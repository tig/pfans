Same the other messages about the seals and it reminded me I want to change
the ones in my 2.0L soon.   Did a search of my saved messages but can't
find the one I saved from way back on these seals.

How do you tell the Viton seals from the regular ones, color, look?  I have
a gasket kit for a 1.7L (the engine from my parts car). Do these kits have
the 'regular' seals?

When I pull the engine I think I'll have to change the oil cooler, I'm
getting a drip from the outer end of it.  Unless it is coming from
somewhere else?  It is dry around the oil pressure sensor.  Any other areas
that could feed a drip out on the end of the oil cooler?

I know these are expensive compared to the Type 1 cooler.  Can they be
rebuilt? Source?   Any places with good prices on new ones?

Thanks,
Jeff
