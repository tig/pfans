Looks like I'll eventually be following the others in the list who have
replaced the P&C's, messed with deck height etc.

I think I found why I was getting the excessive blowby (based on a leak
down test) I posted about awhile back.  I pulled the #3/4 tin off this
weekend to braze up some cracks around the coil mount on tin.  On my
'rebuilt' engine (with only 250 miles on rebuild) the heads and case are
clean and look new but the cylinders on 3/4 are rusty.  So unless they can
rust over in only about 250 miles (over about 5 months),  the guy who
rebuilt it for the PO reused the old cylinders.

Has anyone who has checked a fairly new rebuild noticed if it IS possible
for the cylinders to get rusty that quick?  Suppose to be 'big bore' P&C.

I've been planning to eventually pull the engine to do some de-rust work
prior to a new paint job ( back to the original Alaska Blue Metallic
instead of the current fuschia) so at that point I'll do some engine work
also.
