Hi JJ.

The fuel pressure regulator (FPR) is a simple device -- basically, it's a
valve pushed against a seat by a spring.  The spring (and hence the "seat
pressure) sets the fuel pressure in psi.

The fuel pump pumps fuel up into the regulator (the inlet side), against
the force of the spring. Fuel exits out the side of the regulator (the
outlet side). If the valve is closed, pressure builds up behind it ('cause
the pump can generate more than 30psi of static pressure) and eventually
the valve opens.  Once it opens, the pressure drops siginificantly, and
eventually (in real terms, very quickly) the FPR reaches an equilibrium
whereby the valve is just barely off the seat, and the pressure exerted by
the fuel pump just matches the pressure exerted by the spring.

The fuel pump is always on, and the fuel that can't go "down" the line to
the FPR is recirculated immediately into the tank at.  The fuel that does
go "down" the line to the FPR is also recirculated to the tank once it
exits the outlet side of the FPR. The amount of fuel being recirculated
dwarfs the amount of fuel actually being shot through the injectors into
the intake tracts.  

All the fuel recirculation keeps the fuel cool.

The pump is marked "S", "D" and "R", German for "Sump", "Pressure" and
"Return", respectively.

In the 914, the pump shuts off after 2 seconds if the engine is not running
-- this is to prevent fires in the event of a rollover or crash (assumes
the engine stopped because of the accident).

This system is a little different from most carburated cars, in that their
fuel systems are often one-way, with no return (or dual return, as the 914
has) to the tank to keep the fuel cool.
