I thought I would add my experiences with GV and his parts.  I'll agree with
several other folks posting the comment on the expense of his parts but will
caveatt that my opinion is these parts are some of the best designed 914
conversion parts available.
I have used and recommended his 914-6 conversion centermount which is by far
the most suitable mount in the 914.  For those wanting a mount that is light,
very strong and provides excellent access to lower engine components and
chassis this is it.  It's an improved design over the factory mount and will
save you the trouble the quick-6 (heavy, not suitable for cars wanting heat),
PMS mount (flexes, also restrictive for oil lines) and other bar mounts will
inherantly cause.  It will also put engine weight about 10" forward when
compared to the quick-6 bar.  Fitting this two part mount was something that
required a thorough plan before starting.  Its design uses bolting and
welding for permanent placement and mine required clearancing for the wire
loom and minor trimming for a perfet fit inrelation to the 6ers sheet metal
fit with the engine shelf seals.  I am very happy with this piece and think
it is the best choice for a 914 that is a intended to stay a 914-6.  I would
rate it a 10 in design and a 7 in cost at $450.00.  You can see pictures of
the installed mount at http://www.estinc.com/porsche/rich-6.estinc.  
I have also used the Vellious 916 nose cone for a 915 gearbox buildup and
also his side shifter conversion parts.  Both kits are very good but will
require a very experienced installer and someone with access to some common
machine shop tools for fitting and fine detailing.  It may be best to let
George do the installation if you are not certain the pieces can be installed
correctly along with the R&P flip.
The nose piece required mount machining to correct the right sides mounting
ears dimensions and the left sides mounting ears top side surface as it was
not correctly milled.  This piece does not have a reverse switch provision
but was easily adapted to use a standard 911 switch.  No instruction will be
included with this part but GV will answer any questions you have via
telephone, fax or mail.  I purchased this part form a past customer of GV and
found his experiences finishing this part very similar to mine.  I would rate
the piece an 8/9 out of 10 in design and would have rated it a 9/10 if the
details described above would have been taken care of.  The cost factor would
be rated a 7 as it isn't a part I would describe as cheaply priced.  Keep in
ming this is the only source for this part.   
The side shifter kit was two weeks late in delivery though that didn't pose a
problem with my project.  It too requires a very experienced installer,
machine work and includes no instructions.  Cost is way up there in the
$1300.00 range.  This part is also an exclusive GV part.  
The resulting 915/916 gearbox is an awsome piece but will probably set you
back about $4,000.00 for a professionally setup LSD version.  Thats a
significant cost add to a 914-6 project and would advise those considering
the 914 to 914-6 conversion plann thier project around the 901 gearbox.  It
is probably on hand and is very good choice for engines at 250 HP or below
(2.7L, 3.0L and most 3.2s).  That power band fits almost all of us and my
street 3.0L does great with the original 914s gearbox.  I have added some
taller gears in 3rd, 4th and 5th to better suite the big 6's power and
highway use.
PMS is another story I am not able to speek about from experience but a close
friend has used his aluminum tank, CM mount and C/PP parts.  He may have some
points to add from his experiences.  As far as cable shifters go, I only know
of one user's sad story (a GT2 car in Memphis).   The word is they are not
suitable for street applications and are ionconsistant shifters at best due
to cable movement.  This guy lost his engine due to an overrev and claimed it
was the cable shifter that was the cause.  You should definately do some more
research to find out first had information.  
Any one considering 914-6 oil tank options might make note of the cost drop
the OE tank has recently had.  My use of it has been a good story and I'll
add it has been perfect in fit and has adapted to the 3.0L perfectly.  My
total cost with console, filler nect and mounting hardware ran about $525.00.
Feel free to ask about my conversion as it is still fresh in my mind and I
would love to pass on points to help everyone aviod some of the
misconceptions and mistakes I had prior to the project.  I am sure Andy,
Perry and some of the other guys out there with big 2.7s, 3.0Ls and 3.2s will
add it can makes a great car awsome.  Just add money, mix and go for it.

Good luck.......Rich
