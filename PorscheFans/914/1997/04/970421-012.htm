Dave, you may have forgotten us East coast racers who dream of a warm 914 !
I am currently moving my coller from the rear to nose (will use a Mazda 
cooler up front), and I am pluming the old coller into the passangers 
side with a cut off for hot days.

VW's has Gas heaters, 944's have water, and my '14 will have oil heat.

 Dan

BTW: I drive the car to local events, and they don't get warm here until June
