Ouch. Major bummer.

I checked my relay board anyway. Seems dry and not much in the way of
corrosion. At least nothing new.

I just reterminated the head-temp sensor, it was really corroded. And
leaned the mixture back down a click. So we'll see how it behaves
tomorow.

About 6 months ago, and most of those six months have been spent in a
body shop.

The only place you _can_ get tested is at a state-run facility in
colorado. They seemed to pay attention to the visual, but I don't thnik
they really knew what to look for anyway. It passed with flying colors,
and then I hooked it up to a gas analyzer to richen it up just a tad.
