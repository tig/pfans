    The Rolodex shows:

        Summit Racing:  330 630-3030

    I already gave Haltech's number, so I won't repeat it here.

    You may also want to call Racer Wholesale; they sell a few AF
    meters, including one with dual displays and another that shows
    both AF ratio and injector pulse-width.  They also sell a basic
    K&N meter in a couple of different case designs. 

    Racer Wholesale's number is 800 886-RACE.

    The $175 price that Stephen quotes for the Haltech meter
    probably includes the cost of an O2 sensor, which you'll need no
    matter which meter you eventually choose to buy.
