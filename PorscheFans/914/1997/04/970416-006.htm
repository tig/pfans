	Jerry, my boy, you have just discovered the Rev-Limiting
Rotor.  This is how the rev-limiters on the early (pre-75) 914s
work.  (Late ones evidently have a fuel cut-off.)
	The spring-loaded metal weight actually shorts the spark
to ground within the distributor so that it never goes out to the
spark plug.  There are photos in the Factory and (I think) Haynes
books.  They Haynes one may be mis-labeled.
	At $20+ each, they're not cheap--but they're a lot cheaper
than blowing up your motor if you forget to up-shift.  Of course,
no rev limiter will save you if you down-shift to an insanely high
RPM.
	One of the nice things about this form of rev-limiting is
that it works on just about anything with a distributor, regardless
of fuel system.  Carbed cars, FI'd cars, MFI'd cars...
	Cars equipped with these have an interesting sound when
they hit the limit.  The limiter cuts in and out at a fairly high
frequency (1-2 Hz) and makes the motor sound like "pa-pa-pa-pa".
I've heard that sound from my own car and others at many autoXes.
