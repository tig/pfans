Michael:

You didn't say whether you were planning to perform any work on 
either of these engines before dropping them into your car.

If you're not, I'd keep looking.  The 2-liter motor -- because it has
the carbs, cooler, mounting bar, and headers -- is sorta tempting,
but it just doesn't make enough power (in my opinion, of course) to
make a 914-6 conversion worthwhile.

If the 2.7-liter motor had good compression and you KNEW that it had 
been updated with new studs, piston squirters, and all the other 
necessary mods, I'd recommend buying it.  Since you know nothing 
about it save for the fact that it has low compression, though, it'd 
be save to assume that it's probably a disaster waiting to happen.  
Unless you're planning on opening it up and rebuilding it anyway (in 
which case $2000 is too much money), I'd stay away from it.
