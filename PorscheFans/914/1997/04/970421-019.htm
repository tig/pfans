Interesting timing, getting this message.  I put an NPR 1.7L kit on
my car when I rebuilt my engine 2 years ago.  I've since put 500 
miles on the car, all sunny weather and such.  

I have the engine out to fix the infamous Melling oil pump leak and
noticed the *exact* same problem with mine.  I bottom-end of the jugs
are beautiful while the tops look like they've been sitting in the
rain.

I can attest that not only is it possible but it happened on my
engine as well.  I was wondering about how that could be as well,
thinking only it was due to cheap manufacturing processes of the NPR
kit.  Funny that the "hot-n-dry" side would rust, while the bottom
"oily and cool" could not.

Maybe it has something to do with the heat?  I don't have any 
compression, leak-down or blow-by problems with my engine...

FYI
