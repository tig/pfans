Ok. Here's a weird one.

I'm using the Vellios aluminum oil tank in my 914 six conversion. It has 
a dipstick that I've always assumed was the correct filling level.

I recently changed the oil supply line to use 16-AN fittings throughout,
and updated the hose to a 1" dia. short length. [Previously, I had used a
much longer [perhaps 36"] 3/4" length between the tank and block inlet below
the cooler. The old route looped pretty badly, because I couldn't find
a 45 degree german fitting for the tank. I needed the loop to keep kinks
out of the hose.]

to the point: my 2.4L engine now acts like its 'flooding' with oil while
sitting. On startup I get a HUGE amount of oil
smoke. After driving a bit [< 1 mile], it seems to clear up. I've looked at the
lube schematics, and it seems that there is nothing except the oil
pump itself to keep oil from moving from the tank to the sump. I
know this sounds weird, but its not a problem I've had before.

I've had the oil bypass mod done, but not updated the pump [original 72].

Is the pump 'done for'? When a mag-case pump fails, does it tend to leak
into the sump [blowby?], or just fail to deliver the required pressure? is it 
possible that the bypass modification would change the amount of 
oil that is in the sump? I know it routes sump oil differently. Could
this [too much oil left in the sump] be a side effect of the old pump/updated
bypass combination?

Last clue: I'm almost certain that after updating the hose the tank required
1.5 quarts MORE oil to reach the 'fill' level [10 instead of 8.5]. Almost.

Any words of wisdom?
