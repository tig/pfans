That's a decent setup for a daily driver/autox car.

First off, where is the sway bar set at? Is it full soft? That would
explain your oversteer right there. Stiffen up the bar and if that
doesn't solve the oversteer, then start looking at other factors.
Second, what is your alignment set at? You may not have engough negative
camber in the rear. What kind of tires are you running on?
