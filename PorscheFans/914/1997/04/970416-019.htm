Don't I know it.  Try taking a relatively stock 72 chassis with a few
updates (Koni's, fiberglass hood, and brakes), add a 'messaged' 75 2.0
liter and you instantly jump from CSP to AP this year.  Pretty cool, huh!
:)  I even had a friend try to talk me into registering the car in local
events as a CSP car, but that wouldn't be right, now would it?  Besides, in
our local autox, the most competitive (and largest) class is CSP.  Maybe
I'll have a chance...

Yeh, I might get my butt kicked this year, but it's all about having fun
and building up to the National level (if that's your goal).  Besides, I
have an experimental machine, and it's easy to improve incrementaly when
you start at ground zero.

Good luck in whatever you do or whatever class you end up in.

Dion
