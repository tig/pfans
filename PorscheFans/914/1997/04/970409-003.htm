	Usually means a lean mixture.  Try raising the fuel pressure a
bit and see what happens.  You can tweak the pressure by turning the
knob on the fuel pressure regulator (on my 74 2.0 the bracket sticks up
fron the left-rear engine tin) after loosening the lock nut.
	If the idle knob isn't doing anything to the mixture, it's pos-
sible that the throttle position switch is not correctly adjusted.  It
does two things on D-jet 914s (that I'm aware of):  It adds extra pulses
during acceleration (like an "accelerator pump"), and it switches the FI
to the "idle" setting.
	The basic idea of adjusting it is that you turn the whole switch
housing until there is continuity from one particular pin on the connec-
tor to another with the throttle closed.  I don't know which one it is,
sorry.  RD?  I think you wrote up that procedure...
	Hopefully that will allow you to mess with the idle mixture.  If
I remember correctly, there was also a tweak for helping smooth the idle
with a wilder cam.

	Good luck!
