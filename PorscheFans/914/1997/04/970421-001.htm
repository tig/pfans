	Running hoses containing VERY HOT liquids under pressure through the
passenger compartment was *not* one of Porsche's best ideas.  Remember, the
oil, when at operating temperature, will be 180-240 degrees.  And oil, once
it gets on you, does not like to come off.
	This can turn a relatively minor screw-up ("A leak?  Oh, no!  Now I
have to buy another motor for $4000") into a major medical emergency.
	I personally would feel a lot better with sheet-metal between me and
the oil lines.  Besides, the lines themselves will get pretty hot, and hot
feet would tend to impede my concentration on driving.
	I would suggest running the lines outside the cockpit, unless you
have a race-only car, and are either willing to accept the risks, or want to
make up some sort of enclosure for the lines.
