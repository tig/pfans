Yeah, that could be a problem. The head temp. sensor resistance 
characteristic was no doubt chosen originally from empirical data (or the 
resistance values in the ecu box were chosen that way), in other words 
trial and error (this was the '60's - no sophisticated mainframe modeling 
yet). If you really wanted to get into it, you would have to find a 
source of various thermister types (different reistances) and experiment. 
Since the schematic for the ecu box is basically unknown, this is what 
you're left with, since in this case you want *less* resistance. Another 
alternative would be to wire a potentiometer in parallel with the head 
temp sensor (connect the wiper to one terminal on the pot, connect the 
others to the head temp wire and ground), then adjust and drive to get 
the correct setting on the pot.
