While I was working on my front brakes yesterday, I got to thinking about 
the pros and cons of various brake modifications. For example, since the 
911 master cylinder is larger in diameter, then it would require more 
pedal force to achieve the same pressure, and the pedal would move less 
far. This doesn't look like an upgrade to me, but a down grade. 
Specifically, the force required with the 911 master cylinder is 19/17ths 
times the force required with the 914 master cylinder, and the pedal 
moves only 17/19ths the distance to move the same quantity of fluid. 

So, using the 911 master only makes sense to me if you upgrade the 
calipers to ones that have larger pistons (as in the BMW 320i upgrade). 
The larger pistons require more fluid to move the same distance, and the 
pedal effort would go down because the calipers would require less 
hydraulic pressure to achieve the same clamping force.

So, since I've already purchased the 911 master cylinder, it lookslike 
I'm committed to the BMW brake upgrade. 

I've learned that I shouldn't recommend the 911 master cylinder upgrade 
unless larger calipers are being installed at the same time.
