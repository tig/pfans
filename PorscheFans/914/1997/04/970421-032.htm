Question comes down to this, does anybody know what the factory 911 lines
are made.  Standard copper will work, but it also has a tendency to work
harden.  But then on the 911 they are mounted  very well, imagine that,
and do not move, so they should not work hardened. 

I am not a big fan of Aeroquip lines, not very good at dissipating heat. 
The factory invested time and money into the design, no sense in tossing
someone else's engineering.

Take care,
