I have been incrementally 'improving' the suspension on my '74 914, and
would like a bit 'o advice.

Currently the car has:

Bilstein shock/struts all the way around
Weltmeister 19mm adjustable front anti-roll bar
140 lb springs rear
Stock torsion bars

The car has been lowered on the stock torsion bars to match the 140lb
springs, but now has a tendency to oversteer. I suspect that the proper
approach would be stiffer torsion bars, but barring that for now, would it
be reasonable to set the anti-roll bar to a stiffer setting to help control
the oversteer. What handling quirks might be introduced by such an
approach?

Thanks
