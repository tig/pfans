I recently purchased the complete restoration rubber kit from Automobile
Atlanta. A friend of mine in North Carolina was also thinking of
purchasing this kit but wanted to know my opinion on the quality of the
seals. This is my reason for writing the list. All of the seals worked
great except one, the top to frame seal. This seal is also sold by itself
 to the tune of $75.00. I being the money saving person I am, called
everyone else and found out that the original was about $175.00. I
figured that for $100.00 I'll try to make it work best it can. (having
heard people really talk bad about this seal) Well, to make a long story
short I found out something that even the "great doctor" did not know.
The repro top seal has both the grooves for the original metal retaining
strip! When you remove your old top seal the old metal comes out easily
and with a little patience, fits perfectly in the repro seal. No glue
required and fits the car top perfectly!
Has anyone else figured this out? I was told to glue it then fasten the
top to set the seal.( by AA ) Just wanted to let everyone know before
they (AA) figured it out and raised the price accordingly!!!!!!
