Pholks,

I had to order a new pump, as in testing my modifications to the
existing pump overtorquing caused one stud to break and the cover
to break as well (near the holes for the studs).

I took the new one out of the box and it is now quite *obvious*
what the issue is.  As was mentioned earlier, it is the drive key
material which is too long for the cam.  With the new pump sitting 
on my desk, the key spins easily, silently and wonderfully.  Then I 
noticed that *any*, even the slightest, force pressing the drive
key inward causes the pump to bind up horribly.

Since I have an after market cam, I guess the procedure from here
on out is:
		- file a bit off
                - test fit
                - repeat until clearence is ok.

I know some have said that they had to take 1mm off the key. 
I'll try to post a figure when the work is done.  I'm also going
to be *sure* to use some locktite 574 on this sucker when the
final fitting is done.  

Hopefully friends and hapless victims following my little yellow
914 will then no longer be showered with sprinkles of fresh 20w50 
rustproofing...

Happy motoring...
