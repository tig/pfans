Nick,

As DaveD pointed out, you have to "machine" the pertronix
to make it fit.

What happened on mine (and others) is that the cap would press
the module into the rotor, making the advance mechanism
stop working.

You have to take a fair amount of the epoxy off of the back/
outside of the module to make it clear the cap.  There's
a fair amount on the module, so don't worry.

I used a dremel tool with a sanding drum head.  Went
pretty fast.

If you have an old cap, you can cut it in half and use it to
see just where you doon't fit.
