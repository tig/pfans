Hi Kids,

     Just wanted to solicit opinions about the George Vellios Co.
     I talked to George for some time yesterday about his 914-4
     to -6 conversion parts. He was very up front about the pro's
     and con's of each aspect of the conversion, and of course,
     how well each of his parts fit the bill. Just wanted the collective
     experience of anybody who's dealt with him, good and bad.
     How well do his parts hold up, cost comparison to other outfits
     like Patrick Motorsports? And while we're on the subject, how
     does Patrick Motorsports hold up as well, good, bad, ugly?
     Post to the list as well, I'm sure others on the list wonder
     the same things. Thanks for any input/advice you can offer.

     Rgds
