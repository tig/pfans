VW built the engines, and they took the shortcut of not painting the 
cylinders, most likely. If you want to compare our engines to airplane 
engines, then you'd notice that they all paint thier cylinder barrels. 
Granted, an airplane engine is subject to much more air-born "junk" 
(salt spray, etc) than ours, but I think it's still a good idea.

I don't know abou the brass, unless someone went to the trouble of 
plating the outside of the barrels. This, of course, would be the ideal 
way to both protect the iron and enhance conductivity. If you race, then 
copper plate the barrels (if it's legal), for street, zinc plate them. 
Zinc has better conductivity than iron, so the cylinders would run 
cooler. 

A lot of people seem to think that painting them flat black will enhance
conductivity, but the mistake there is that the color of the material only
matters when the dominant mode of heat transfer is radiation. This only
happens at very high temperatures (much higher than engine temps) and in a
vacuum. Otherwise, the dominant mode is conduction and convection. Color
doesn't matter at all with these modes. You'll get slightly better
convection with a rough surface from flat paint, but I'd rather have
glossy paint because it tends to stay cleaner (dirt is a good thermal
insulator), and is easier to clean. Hell paint them gloss pink if the 
spirit moves you.
