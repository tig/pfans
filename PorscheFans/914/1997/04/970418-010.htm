	NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!
	The cooling flaps perform a *VERY* important task at *all*
times.  The one on the right-hand side, in particular.  It splits
the airflow from the cooling fan and diverts part of it down through
the oil cooler.  Without the flaps, the car will run too hot, and
its lifespan will suffer accordingly.  Not to mention the pattern of
airflow on both sides changing.
	This is one of the pieces of mis-information that appears to
be immortal in the VW world.  The cooling flaps are needed in *ALL*
VWs, but people insist on pulling them out.

	If the spring is still on the shaft for the flaps, it will
hold the flaps in the "warm engine" position.  From my reading of
Dirk's note, I think he was saying the opposite, which is untrue.
(Sorry if I'm wrong, Dirk!)  The lever on the shaft is pulled down-
ward by the contracted bellows when the engine is cold.  When the
engine warms up, the bellows expands, and the spring pulls the lever
up which opens up the flaps.  That's all there is to it.
