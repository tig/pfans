Hi All:
Just wanted to post some comments regarding a product called dynamat. I
originally purchased the pre cut door panels from Automotion and installed on
both my doors. The product really works and the doors close with a solid
"thunk". After reading the tech tips in Excellence several months ago I
decided to replace the rear window seal. Since I was going to have to pull
the back pad in order to remove the window I decided to go ahead and put
dynamat behind the backpad on the firewall. I again purchased the large mat
from Automotion (69.95). This also works quite well. The next project is to
install dynamat on the floor. I know AAtlanta sells the orginal German tar
pad but my car never came with the stuff so I think I will just put down some
more dynamat. Crutchfield has 19.5 x 32 for $19.95.

Battery Tray Coating:
Autoatlanta and Automotion both sell battery tray sealers for $10.95 and
$14.95. I purchased clear "plasti-dip" from the local hardware store for
$6.00. Although it takes a number of coats to really cover the tray, the
stuff really works. Also installed a new battery mat so I think my battery
problems are over for awhile.
