Seeing as a hockey puck is hard-vulcanized rubber, and the old insert
was too, it may work.

Look at you local hardware store for imbeddable threaded inserts.  (It's
a disk with prongs, and a threaded tube.  Kind of like a stove-pipe hat
with prongs in the top of the brim, and threads on the inside.)

Sink a couple of those in your hockey puck; they'll hold better.

But I can't see how anything like this could possible work without duct
tape!  :)

Gary.

(Or you could brow-beat George into rebuilding these things....)
