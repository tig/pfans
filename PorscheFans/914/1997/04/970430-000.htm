Well, I take what time I can get with making progress in getting my 914
back on the road.  I've been busy with the other cars, so time's been in
short supply. 

I removed one of the rear wheel bearings last night because they are both
suspect. With the stub axle installed and the castelated nut tight, I have
a little play in the bearing with the wheel on (you can grab the wheel and
wiggle it). Since I did not want to put this all back together and find
out that they are in fact no good, I'm replacing them. I'm going to take
the bearing I took out last night down to my local bearing supply shop and
get the bearings cheaper from them. Re-assembly should be a snap 
(thankfully I have a 3# hammer - taptap)

I also got started on re-packing my CV joints. I don't like those snap
rings they use - there aren't any holes for a pair of snap ring pliers to
grab onto. I wound up using whatever tool was handy to get them off. I
soaked the CVs in keorsene and scrubbed them with a wire brush. I also
used Brake Cleen to get the last bits of old grease off. Repacking is time
consuming, to say the least. I'm using Valvoline Synthetic Racing Grease,
which says right on the tube that it's good for CV joints. I used a bunch
to make sure the joint was well lubricated. Getting the boot off of the CV
can be a pain, though. The metal flange has to be knocked off with a
hammer, which is hard to do with the CV off of the shaft. Also, there's a
cup washer on the inner side of the CV that has to be installed in the
correct orientation on the axle. The correct way is such that the washer
has to be compressed in order to get the snap ring back on. The purpose of
the washer is to maintain pressure on the snap ring to keep it from
working loose, and also to keep the inner part of the CV joint from moving
around and wearing out the axle splines. I'm doing this to save money in
the long run - reman'd axles are what? 150$ each? This is only costing me
grease and other misc. cleaners, and time, of course. Those of us low on 
money usually have lots of time (old middle class saying).
