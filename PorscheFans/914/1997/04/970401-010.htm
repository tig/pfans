	Due to the unavailability (or EXTREME prices on the available ones),
I've decided that I'm going to try to pull a MacGuyver on my smog pump
pulley.  So, before I destroy my engine, I thought I'd pick your brains
for some good ideas.  
	Here's what I'm thinking so far:  I'll pull off the rest of the rubber
between the plate and shaft on my existing pulley, and clean both
surfaces.  I'll then attempt to machine a hockey puck into a replacement
rubber mount.  If I drill three small holes in each of the sandwich
plates, glue the hockey puck in with rubber cement, and drive six small
screws into the puck through the plates (three on each side), then I
think I'll have an effective smog pump pulley once again.  
	I know, it makes no use of bubble gum or pantyhose (or even duct tape),
but hey, a lot has changed since the 80's.  So, do you think there's any
chance this could work, or am I just playing with fire?  I can take the
assembly off once I pass emissions (not like I'd do that, of course :)
), so I'm not too concerned about the long term effects of the pulley
being out-of-balance.  
	I really don't have a clue what "vulcanization" is, much less where I'd
go to have it done.  Is there a really good reason that the smog pump
pulley has to have a rubber drive shaft?  If it doesn't, then I'll just
whip up an aluminum spacer.  
	Again, any comments about my lunacy (or actual help) would be greatly
appreciated!

Thanks,

road!)
