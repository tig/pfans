  Check the copper braided jumper from Points plate to dist body. I bet 
it is broken ! When it breaks you start to arc weld spots on the plate, 
and the plate "Sticks & jumps about" then depending when you set the 
timing befor or after the break you get strange things to happen "Power 
comes and goes". Cheap to fix, Replace the plate it comes out easy and is 
a VW part. George at AA has thenm in stock for about $25, He tought me 
this trick when I was thinking of replacing the Dist. which he could have 
sold me at alot more money.
