This weekend I finally installed the Pertronix Point eliminator in my
distributor. These are very easy to install (though it did take me
longer than the 15 minutes listed on the box) and I had no trouble. I
did find that my vacuum advance on the distributer is not working, as I
had suspected. I just did the "suck on the tube" test you find in the VW
idiot book. The point plate doesn't budge, so I guess I'll travel to the
junk yard for a new diaphragm. Otherwise, the new "points" worked great
until.........
(theres always a catch, isn't there :(
On the way in to work today, after the stoplight before the bridge, 1st
gear, all is well till about 2k rpm when the car starts jerking back and
forth like a bad clutch......shift to 2.......o.k..........next light.
Same thing coming off the line...........go to
2.........ok...............3rd at 4k rpm.......fine..............no
problem, the rest of the trip all is ok.
I am wondering if this was the new "points" or something else.....maybe
FI clog?...dist adv? Hmmmm.

Anyone out there had similar problems? I don't think its the point
eliminator, cuz the higher rpms seem much smoother than before and my
timing is right on. Anyhow, whatever the gremlin was it was minor and
seems to have resolved itself. Perhaps just the monday morning blues.
