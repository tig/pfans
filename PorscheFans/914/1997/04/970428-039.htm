Hi fellow 914ers,

Last Sunday decided to retrieve my 74 2.0 from it's winter storage location
at a dry barn about 10 miles from my home. I called a friend and fellow
Porsche owner for a ride over to the car. He enthusiastically said he would
be happy to bring me over and a few minutes later showed up at my house in
his daily driver Volkswagen Jetta (he owns a 356 B undergoing restoration).

I gather some tools and my charged battery and we trek over to the barn. I
uncover the car, install the battery, fire her up...sounds great, and pull
her out into the sunshine. After a few other checks, my friend says he will
follow me home...just in case something happens. So off we go.

We pull out of the driveway onto the small country backroad. About a 1/4 mile
down the road is a merge with another road and a yield sign. I spot a car
approaching from my left and stop to allow him to merge in front of me.
CRASH...my friend rear ends my 914. He said he saw the car approaching and
thought I wasn't going to stop. When he looked up I was stopped in front of
him and he couldn't stop in time. Luckily neither of us was hurt...but the
914 sustained rear bumper, bumper guards, valance, bumper top, panel behind
bumper, panel between taillights and trunk lid and lock damage.

I wonder if anyone has any of the above parts available. The bumper is black
painted as is the valance. I also need the passenger side (right) rear bumper
guard. Could also use a replacement panel between the tailights. Can anyone
help?

Thanks,
