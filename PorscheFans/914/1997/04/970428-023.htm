I've always assumed it was because the P&C sets are cheap.  A basic set of
1600cc P&C can be had for about $100.  Probably not worth making oversized
for that.  Also some of the big names like Gene Berg recommended against
trying to even hone and re-ring.

There's something here that still bothers me about VW engines, which is why
are oversize pistons not availble? I talked to a motorcycle guy, and he
said all of the air cooled angines get bored for oversize pistons when they
are rebuilt, and that the pistons are commonly availble. Even the flat twin
BMW engines are treated this way. They only replace the cylinders when they
run out of oversize pistons. So, why, O why are we forced to replace the
whole shebang at every rebuild??? Oh yeah, the guy said all of the
motorcycle engines have cylinders that wear unevenly, so that's not an
excuse.
