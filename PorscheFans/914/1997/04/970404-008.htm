	Actually, it's a lot simpler than that.  On the D-jet cars,
the pressure regulator is nothing more than a spring-loaded valve.
When the fuel pressure, on the one side of the valve, rises above
the spring pressure on the other side, the valve opens and excess
fuel bleeds off in direct proportion to the delta in pressures.  (I
think it's direct proportion...)  You can adjust these regulators
by backing off the locknut and tweaking the screw on the one end.
This pushes the spring in more or less, changing the pressure that
is exerted by the spring.  Hmm, to do that it would have to be one
of those progressive-rate springs...  Anyway, nothing electrical
about it.  The signal to run the pump is driven entirely by the ECU.

	As for Larry's problem, I'm not sure I understand.
	OK, you've got a fuel pressure gauge plumbed into the system,
correct?  And you can verify the fuel pressure is 30 PSI (or a bit
less).  Now, when the fuel pump is disabled, the car runs fine for
quite a while.  What does the pressure gauge say at that point?  Zero
PSI pressure?  It shouldn't take very long for the fuel pressure to
bleed down (while the car is running) to very low, unless the pump
really is running or there's pressure coming from somewhere.
	Have you unplugged the fuel pump, to make sure that it isn't
running?  Is the car significantly nose-up, parked on a hill or some
such?  Is the gas tank out of the car and held 10 feet above the car?
(Gravity feed can work, maybe...)
	It might be that this behavior is just something to live with,
but the way-too-rich at 30 PSI is definitely something to fix.  The
head temp sensor (as Dan F. already suggested) is a likely suspect.
The manifold pressure sensor is another--broken diaphragm, incorrectly
hooked up (getting ambient instead of manifold vacuum), etc.  Try
dialing the fuel pressure down to 28 PSI, which is the spec.  Not a
huge difference, I know, but still...
	The other main suspects would be the cold start valve and the
thermo-time switch that turns it off.  Fuel could keep getting squirted
into the manifold even when it isn't supposed to.

	Good luck!
