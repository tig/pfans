Thanks to Jason, David, Josh & Chris for their input.

I stiffened up the front 19mm sway bar, and that has eliminated the over
steer. The collar on the sway bar adjustment is now about 5/8 of the way
toward the stiffest setting. Actually it now understeers a bit, but tucks
in with throttle lift. Need to fine tune it with an autocross or a trip to
a driving event.

I think I may have learned something about sway bars. Tell me if I'm wrong,
but for a given amount of anti-roll force, a thicker bar will allow more
wheel travel since the pickup point would be farther out on the sway bar
arm?
