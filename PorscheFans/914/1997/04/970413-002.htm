Now that I've completed the task, I can answer my own questions.  In case 
someone else needs to know:

I'm converting my mismatched door windows to Lexan and want to check a few 
"facts" which I hope some of you can confirm or set me straight:
1. It looks like the long and short fuzzy channels from the late style will 
fit in the front (aluminum) and rear (sheet metal) vertical channels - right?
WRONG.  The rear guide will take the fuzzy, but the front one's opening is too 
small.
2. In addition to the outside squeegee, there is an outside aluminum channel 
which holds both the squeegee (by the bottom) and a fuzzy which is pressed 
against the outside of the glass.  Can that fuzzy be ordered separately, or 
does it only come attached to the aluminum channel?
Can be ordered separately (e.g., from Stoddard).  I found it to be redundant 
however.
3. The only inner fuzzy is the U-shaped flexible (woven?) cap that rides on 
top of the inner door panel sheet metal, right?
RIGHT.
4. Was the late rear guide in any way better or worse than the early?  If so, 
how?
It is fastened better.
Thanks in advance,
