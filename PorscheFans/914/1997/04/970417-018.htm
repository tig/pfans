Only if your car is newer than 1982!  There are lots of little shops
that can give you the test, just as long as your car is old enough.  Did
you notice how there were two different prices for the car, depending on
the age?  The newer cars have to go on the dyno, and the older ones just
need to pass at idle, and at something like 3500 RPM.  Oh well, it's a
good sign if you can pass at the state run facility.  They're much
stricter.  Did you happen to catch if they pulled out a book or looked
something up?  I've got a friend with carbs, and I'm afraid they just
say, "No Way".

Thanks,
