It never ran CSP.  If I would have kept the 1.7 in it, it would be in CSP
this year.

As I understand it, AP is where I fall (because of the 2.0 liter swap-up)

And as far as not being competitive in AP with a 914, I think we will be in
our local club, at least on a limited basis.  Last year, a good friend of
mine ran his 73 2.0 liter in FP.  Mods included:  dual Weber 40's, Mallory
ignition, K. Hunter exhaust, Welmeister sway bars (front and rear), Koni's,
steel flares and 7" rims all around (with R1's).  He consistently came
close to FTD every weekend and that was against a lot of brutal competition
including some V8 powered Austin Healey's and MG's that seemed lightening
fast.  He smoked both of the Cobra's that would show up.  What it all comes
down to is driver's skill.  One member of our club was ES National Champ
last year, and he 'appears' to be the slowest one on the course while he's
out there.  When he shows up, ES wins or comes close to FTD!  

IMHO, that's what the difference is between a lot of local club autocrosses
and the SCCA autocrosses.  Our local SCCA autox draws less than half of the
cars that our club does (at least the ones I've been to).

Again, my opinion means squat.  If you're having fun, that's all that matters.
