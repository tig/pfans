The 911 trombone cooler is used with a thermostat located just ahead of 
the rear wheel in the right rear wheel well.  I believe you want the 
thermostat to be closer to the engine than the cooler.

On my 914-6 race car, I have a Mocal thermostat located where the stock 
fuel pump was mounted (just  ahead of the right inner trailing arm 
mount).  Currently I have steel-braided lines passing through the 
passenger compartment, but previously I had rubber lines running through 
the defunct heater ducts.  For track cars (with no heaters) this is an 
excellent solution, since call the holes are already cut in the car, and 
the lines are protected from damage by the ocassional off-course 
excursion.  There is nothing wrong with using high-pressure rubber hose, 
it's designed to carry hydraulic pressure and can easily handle the 100 
PSI any 914 might generate.
