Assuming you have the corect 17mm hex tool, you might try what I had to 
do to remove my drain plug on the bmw. Put a jack under the end of the 
tool and start jacking the the car up. (make sure you've got it in the 
unscrew direction) If it still won't budge, try either pulling down on 
the car from the underside, or jumping on top of the car. If that doesn't 
work, get an impact air tool or get some help.

They are the detents for the shift rails. Make sure that they were 
installed in the exact order that they came out. The Haynes manual shows 
the correct order.
