The click type have a short beam in them, and the end of the beam has a 
recess where a spring loaded ball resides. When the lateral force due to 
the beam wanting to bend overcomes the spring compression on the ball, 
the beam snaps against the inside wall of the tool, and the user feels a 
click. These tools are known to obtain a "set" unless the spring is 
completely untensioned after use. Also, the friction in the ball detent 
varies over time, and thus the accuracy. 

The beam type directly reads the motion of the beam along a scale. They 
tend to stay in spec for longer provided they are not abused by 
overtorquing or rough handling. 

There was some extensive discussion on this over inthe bmw mailing 
list. The Raceware people seem to have some knowledge about these things, 
and they favor the direct reading beam type. They sell a couple for about 
triple what Sears sells them for, but the Raceware people claim 2% 
accuracy, twice that of Sears. Raceware has a web site, too (forgot the 
details)
