You don't have to shorten the pushrods. Typical procedure in the Veedub 
world is to put spacers under the rocker arm supports. I've heard that 
the domed pistons are better for FI, while flat top ones are better for 
carburetors. I don't why, though. 

Another thought is that since the flat top piston has the minimum surface
area, it will run cooler than the domed type. (less aluminum exposed to
the combustion process) This idea is from an old book I read about air
cooled engines. 

But, really, don't expect much of a gain in hp over stock with the 
modifications you've planned. Increasing the CR by the amount you're 
thinking will only gain you a few hp. The most direct route for more hp 
in these engines is more displacement. Since the stock exhaust system is 
limited in how wide the engine can be, then stroking the motor can 
realistically be done while retaining a stock-compatable exhuast. The 
only other means of increasing displacement is a big bore kit. However, 
the FI will not work in stock form with a big bore kit (larger clyinders 
and stock intake systems makes for much more vacuum). A big bore engine 
may require a set Webers to obtain the best performance.

So, the bottom line is that modifying these engines for more hp is a 
complicated process, invlolving much thought and possible legal hurdles.
