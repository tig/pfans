Hi 914-er's!

  When I was trying to get just plain stock pistons a while back, I spoke to Jim at GPR and he said 
that he could get oversize pistons, but I'd have to have my barrels bored to get them to fit...  meaning, 
I suppose that they would be .020" oversize, or something like that.  I don't know how far one can 
safely go on punching out barrels, but I was a little leery about doing this, especially since there was 
no measurable wear in my old ones.
  Anyway, I think that GPR can get them, and a bike shop would probably be the place to go to get 
them bored correctly; anyone out there want to try and report the results?

  On a related subject, I understand that TRW makes 94 mm replacement pistons for the 914, 
compression unknown.  Does anyone out there know of someone who reps TRW parts and could 
get price, availability and specs for TRW pistons for a 914 2.0 litre?

                                                  Thanks in Advance,
                                                  Jim T
