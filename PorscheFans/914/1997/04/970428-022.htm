I recall seeing a short article about this in Excellance.  The guy who
wrote the article used, I think, stainless steel.  It also mentioned
something about bending the front to match the curve where the fuel lines
exit.  Is there any problem pre-bending these then feeding through from the
back.  Any problems getting through the tie downs?  Assuming the shifter
and pedal cluster are out since I'm planning to do this when I pull the
engine to do some other work.

Copper tubing is stronger than aluminum, I believe, and you can get it at
your local autoparts store. Use 5/16" if you're moving the fuel pump up
front, otherwise you're going to need a mix of 3/8" and 5/16". The supply
line from the tank is 3/8", the rest of the system is 5/16". If you have
carbs then you just need one 5/16" line with some kind of adapter for the
3/8" tank supply.

With the rear of the car in the air, you can just pull out the lines from
the rear, and replace by pushing the new lines in. You have to remove the
shift lever first because there is a tie down for the existing fuel
lines. It also helps to have the pedal cluster out.
