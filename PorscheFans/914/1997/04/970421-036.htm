  For Jerry R. Brady and other interested parties:

  STOP!  URGENT!

  Please read this posting before you have any machine work done on your oil pump!

   Jerry... Please Wait!!   I hope I caught you in time!  If you mill down the gears, they will have 
excessive end clearance in the pump housing, and the pump will not produce adequate pressure... 
end of pump!

  I reproduce below an article that I posted to the the various 914 web pages concerning the DEE 
engineering pump.  It is probable that the Melling pump has a similar difficulty.  Please read the 
article reproduced below and see if it's applicable... you may save yourself a ton of money, and 
possibly even your engine, since the mod you are contemplating will likely result in such loss of oil 
pressure when warm as to damage the engine.

  
  " I have just finished installing one of the after-market 
oversize oil pumps in my 914.  These pumps are the 
same ones available from Automotion, Performance Products,
and G.P.R. of San Luis Obispo.  (I got mine from G.P.R.)
   There is a POTENTIAL PROBLEM that should be addressed
with these pumps.  The actual pump in question is made by
DEE Engineering, Inc.  and is their part # DE-3034-10.  The 
problem is that the drive tang on the driven gear shaft is
TOO LONG!  
   To determine if your installation requires a modification,
install the oil pump body in the engine case, omitting 
the gasket for test fitting purposes.  Install the gears in the
pump body.  Obtain a machinist's straight edge, or use the
cover plate for the pump.  Slide your reference edge (the
cover plate flat, if used) over the pump so as to cover the
gears.  The straightedge should just clear both gears
(gears should be  flush with the outer machined surface of
the pump body).  If the edge will slide over the driven gear,
but not over the driving gear (the one with the shaft and 
tang), the modification is necessary.
   Remove the driven gear and grind about 1 mm off the
end of the drive tang.  You can compare it to the tang
on your original pump; it should be about the same length.
Wash off the gear and shaft in solvent to remove any trace
of abrasives, and retry using the straight edge.  The edge
should now just clear both gears.  
   Proceed to install and assemble the pump as per the
supplied instruction sheet.
   NOTE:  Failure to make this modification if necessary
will place excessive end loads on both camshaft and
oil pump, causing premature failure of one or both parts.
   Many thanks to Dave at G.P.R. for putting me wise to
this problem."

  I hope this helps.
                                            Jim T.
