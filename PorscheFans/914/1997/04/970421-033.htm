Dave, Dan, Mike, Stephen, et al,

Thanks for the input.  I was going to run the lines down the right side
rocker panel, as the filter is on that side, and it's easier to run the
lines from the sandwich adapter down that side.  I think though, that I'll
just run the lines up and over the tire, along the front fender, and back
down again to the cooler.  I'll probably install a drain fitting at the
cooler (but I bet I'll never use it :)

I still haven't decided what type of hard line to run the oil through.  The
comments about copper are beginning to scare me, so it will probably boil
down to either steel or aluminum.  Aluminum for heat dissipation, or steel
for strength from road debris in the inner fender.  Or both?  

And where does everyone put the thermostat--at the back by the engine or in
front by the cooler?  Or do I even need one?

- Brian
