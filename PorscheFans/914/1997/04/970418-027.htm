In my quest to get my 914 back on the road, I have managed to find a


working 1.7L engine to install in place of my poor old oil-gushing 1.8L
(currently in many many pieces).  Before putting the engine in, I figure
I should check the valves, change the plugs, etc., etc.  The problem is
that I'm not sure what the proper valve clearance is for a '71 1.7L
engine.  For some reason, I think it's supposed to be .006", but since I
don't know where that number came from, I don't really want to trust it.
I've tried going back through the archives, but haven't found anything
(except that the archives could really really use a search feature).
Anyone out there remember what the proper clearance really is?
