Mike, you started off in the right direction but got it kind of switched
around on the end. A bigger, stiffer or in your case a swaybar period is
going to stiffen up the front end of the car and all things being equal tend
to reduce oversteer or increase understeer.  Your experience is a prime
example.  With no swaybar your car tended to oversteer.  After installing
the factory bar it became more neutral with maybe a bit of understeer.
Carrying that theme further, if the car is still oversteering with an
adjustable front sway bar we would want to make that bar even stiffer to
dial it out. Hope that makes sense.
