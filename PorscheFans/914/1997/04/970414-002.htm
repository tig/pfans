	Yup, some or all of the 74 2.0s had the no-advance deal.
	For vaccuum retard, the idea is that it only does anything for a
fairly high vaccuum--when the throttle is closed or mostly closed.  It
helps cut down on emissions and fuel consumption, and according to RD Ricks,
"makes for a nice low idle".
	The retard is usually hooked to manifold vaccuum, generally just
after the throttle valve.
	The advance line, if hooked up, usually runs to a port very very
close to where the throttle is when closed.  It evidently only works at low
throttle settings.  I've heard that it's mostly an emissions thing, but I've
also heard that someone who added the vacc advance to his 914 felt a real
change in pick-up.
	You may be able to add a vaccuum advance to your 912E by finding a
throttle body with take-offs (ports, whatever) for both hoses on it.  I do
not know if the 914/2.0 TB is identical or not (I suspect it is) but if so,
talk to RD Ricks.  I think he still has one or two lying around for sale.
	You can also get one installed on your own throttle body, if you can
find a machinist who knows where it should go.
