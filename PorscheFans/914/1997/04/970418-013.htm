Dirk,

I have never heard of a negative value potentiometer??? Maybe I miss
understood your diagram. Are we in a true parallel wiring schematic?  Or
from what you described I picture it as being a series install which
would only add resistance.  Of course you could eliminate the temp
sensor, from the FI and get the resistance value you need buy adjusting
the value.  Then you would also need to measure the head temp, and
Air/fuel ratio or Exhaust Gas.  then spend the time to lookup an
appropriate replacement sensor.  Good way to spend a weekend.

BTW, AMP P/N for the brain connector is:  Well now I don't have it,
Doahhh!  RD, the AMP P/N was on one of the injector harnesses I sent to
you if you still have it please post it back up to the list.  I have
looked on every other harness I have all VW P/Ns

 Oh, some body said they had someone that would reverse engineer these
boxes a while back.  They also asked if some one had a spare for
sacrifice in the name of science.  Well folks I have just such an animal,
and would be more than willing to sacrifice it in the name of science if
it helps you guys out.  It is an extra one I have around, I don't need it
since I have other tricks up my sleave. :-)

Take care,
Stephen Jacobs
