Ah phoey! The last cars you should be worried about are those muscle
cars. They can't handle anywhere near as well as a "Prepared" class 914.
The cars you should really be worried about are the Lotus Elan, Europa,
Seven, and Super 7. The last time anything other than a Lotus won a
nation championship in the open AP class was 1975 and 1973 by a Porsche
914-6. And those are the only non-lotus wins in the history of SCCA
national championships in the open AP class.
