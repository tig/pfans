This is where I'm getting so confused.  All of my information is coming
from Bill at Mark Stephens high Performance.  He has, on several
occasions, talked about 0 deck height, but never explained how.  He was
the one, however, that said that .026 was the min.  Ack!  Now I'm more
lost than ever!

I might be able to come upon some careful measuring devices.  Just
exactly what do I want to measure?

Thanks again,
