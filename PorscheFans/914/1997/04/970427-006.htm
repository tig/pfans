Hello Everyone, 

 Here in So Cal it was Porsche swap meet time this Sunday, the turn out
was great and the was some very nice 914's, 914-6's, and a few very nice
6 conversions. The parts area was good too, but not too much in the line
of nice 914 parts. I meet or ran into several listers, Glenn S was
selling parts and scored a nice set of 2.0L alloys with lugs. Son N was
shopping and scored a very nice RX-7 comp oil cooler and dropped off his
BMW calipers to have them machined. Jeff L was shopping but dont think
he found any goodies, but he did bring out the 73 2.0L +. and yes its
really is pink, well ok Jeff Purplish. Meet David B  (P-Parts dealer
with good prices) and talked for a while. and got to see Roy J and his
Very Beautiful 73 914-6 GT again.  And I scored some RS 993 mirrors
(manuel) new in the factory box complete, I saw them on another 914-6 GT
once and it looked pretty cool, so I need a set, and the price was so
good I just couldnt pass it up.
 All in all it was a Good Porsche swap meet day !!

 With all this said, and now that I have the 993 mirrors I would like to
sell the set (2) of stock 914 mirrors I have, they are new in there
factory boxes w/seals
and SS screws, never installed, perfect!  If your in the market for a
set, shop around like I did, I dont think you can find them cheaper. I
only want that I have into them.$210.00 and I will pay for shipping.

 and I also still have a set of Wheels;

911 Fuchs 16x6's &7's, polished and
painted with caps and Michelin Z rated tires 205/55/16 and 225/50/16's
 with 40% tread left and no curb grinds,   For Sale $500.00
  Im close to OC/LA/SB counties in California.
  

 Thanks and have a Great Day, 

  Don
