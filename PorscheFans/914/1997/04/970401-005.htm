 Hello, 
 I will try to answer from what I've read, seen and what my mechanic has
told me. Im putting mine in the front trunk.

 There are many different types, but one of the cheapest in the Mazda
RX-7 modified (Mazda Comp) when its modified it looks just like a 930
cooler. I have to buddies that build P-Race cars and they use these for
oil coolers and trans coolers.


> 2. Mounting before or behind the front trunk sheet metal ?

Behind sheet, inside the trunk. Mount it on the flat spots where the
suspension bolts are inside, across the front of the apron.

 Depends if you want to notch the bumper and valance ? I have seen a ton
of pictures and kinda guessed the size, since the original GT car where
race cars , Im sure the size varied. At this point I have only notched
the valence and pulled the plugs into the trunk, I will be cutting out
the holes in front of the notched valance. This way you get the air and
you dont have to cut the front bumper and its a little more stealth.


> 4. Is AN12 appropriate for oil line size ?

 Thats the size Im welding onto my coolers today. also the size the Race
buddies use.

 Rocker panel space. the original GT car had the oil lines run into the
car down by your feet and out the back side of the peddles ? must have
made for hot feet ! I think they did this so not to rub the tires on the
oil lines ? But just run the oil lines high in the fender well and it
shouldnt be a problem

> 6. Anything else I should know ?

 I have heard A.J. Racing sells a cooler kit using a Mazda modified oil
cooler for $800.00 but I have not seen there catolog. I wanted one and
didnt want to pay my mechanic $300.00 to modify for me so I had my
racing buddie show me how its done. to date I have made 6 Mazda Comp oil
cooler ( 3 will be done today,but ones mine) If you buy one already made
make sure they have cut out the stock RX-7 thermostat and they cut off
th stock fittings and use #12's.

 BTW, I will have a Mazda Comp cooler to sell by tomorrow if you/anyone
interested. I cuold make more if needed, but it would take me 3 or 4
days. Another time monster!

 They are easy to make , but make sure whom ever makes it knows what
they are doing !!! 




 Just my take on the Cooler issue, Good luck,
