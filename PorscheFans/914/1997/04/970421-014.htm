No. Not neccessarilly. This starts coming down to driver preference. I
like a very firm brake pedal, and the amount of travel I had with the
17mm master was not satisfactory. Heel-toeing for me was too difficult
if the brake pedal was below the accelerator. The 19mm does require more
pressure than the 17mm, true enough. But it's no where near as bad as
you make it out to be, and the pedal feels much firmer. The 17/19ths
difference comes out to be about 11%. That's really not that much. In
addition, the 19mm (IMHO) provides the driver with much better pedal
feel than the 17mm.

Try the master by itself first. Bleed well and install good pads. You'll
find it's probably it's acceptable if not quite nice.

If this were so, why do so many people upgrade the master and not the
calipers? I will usually determine what I do and do not recomend by
experience rather than supposition. This is not a flame, just a better
way of gathering data about mods. I will rarely recomend anything that I
havn't had experience with. Unless it's something that everyone in the
world says is the right thing to do. Like 5-lug wheels in a six
conversion. Havn't done one myself, but I've found it's pretty much
agreed to be the way to go.

I havn't heard any complaints about a 19mm master upgrade yet. So either
lot's of folks like it or they've all died in horrible accidents
involving insufficient braking performance resulting from the 11% larger
master cylinder. :)
