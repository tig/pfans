Copper tubing is stronger than aluminum, I believe, and you can get it at 
your local autoparts store. Use 5/16" if you're moving the fuel pump up 
front, otherwise you're going to need a mix of 3/8" and 5/16". The supply 
line from the tank is 3/8", the rest of the system is 5/16". If you have 
carbs then you just need one 5/16" line with some kind of adapter for the 
3/8" tank supply. 

With the rear of the car in the air, you can just pull out the lines from 
the rear, and replace by pushing the new lines in. You have to remove the 
shift lever first because there is a tie down for the existing fuel 
lines. It also helps to have the pedal cluster out.
