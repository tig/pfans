Dear Jim,

	Yes of course I tried the Vitron seals, and they leak also. I 
have 3 - 914's and I have found that the high heat of the "Race" motor - 
which is a STOCK 2.0 but without heatexchangers which lets it run cooler, 
although the oil heat gets high in races, is better with leakage that any 
of the others.

The street cars start leaking within a couple of months.

so the trick is as follows:

1. clean the tubes and the seals with brakeclean
2. Let it dry
3. Using copper rtv (the only one that will take the head heat) NEATLY
   press a glob of RTV around the tube - head mating aera.
4. Work the RTV into the head making an even seal
5. Clean all extra RTV off the tube and head aera with vinegar and cloth
6. Let dry 24 hours or more before applying heat

Thats the end of the problem !

The fact that the PO of your car had spread RED RTV every were shows that 
he had no ideal of what he was doing. BTW Red is only good for 100 
degrees so it went as soon as the car got warm.

No wonder it looked like the Valdeaze had been there.

Now for the flood under my -6 thats another story, yet to be solved.

Dan
