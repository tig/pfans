hi all, it's been a while since i posted anything here, but it's nice to =
be back. =20

the 914 is out of storage, and seems to run just fine.  in fact i had =
put the thing away last december after having to boost the battery to =
get it started (had been sitting for two weeks), drove it 10 miles to =
the barn, and forgot it for the winter  (cold cold cold... ontario =
canada).  i meant to take the battery out, i really did.  i sort of knew =
that the battery would be un boostable, so we brought rope to pull start =
it.  son of a gun if i did not just put the key in, turn and it =
started!!!!

of course the plate was expired, but with my buddy behind me blocking =
view, should be no problem.  hmmm, left rear needs some air, lets stop =
and see another buddy on the way, and get some air.  while there, i =
think of the fact that he has a dealer plate.  i put it on and we leave. =
 since it's been a few miles from the barn now, it should be warmed up =
eh?  nail it going out of the lot... long wavy pair of black marks... =
damn this is fun!  say isn't that a cruiser coming out of richmond =
towards us?

well it seems there is a big fine for having a real plate on the front, =
and a dealer plate on the back, say... those bumpers look a bit =
flimsy... are they plastic on all porsches?  you know, it's a bit loud, =
i noticed you did not use your turn signals when i pulled you over (nice =
use of hand signals by the way), seems they have the same problem as the =
brake lights.  by the way, looked like a fine burnout leaving the shop =
there...

well he lent me some tools to get the front plate off, said "don't be =
stupid now" and let me go.  maybe there is a god after all.

anyway, i've noticed a thread going here on deck height/cr head work and =
so on.  i have the 103 p/c's from eurorace and a 78.5 mm crank (2.6 l)  =
i had to have the cylinders turned to reduce the deck height from 4 mm =
to about 1.5 (can't remember all the numbers).  i had RTR (where bill at =
Mark Stephens was at the time) do the heads (big valves, ported, =
flycut).  long and short of it is i ended up with about 10:1 and it just =
runs on 94 octane until it gets really hot.  i put 15 - 20% toluene or =
xylene in and things seem just ducky (smells nice too).

i use the car for solo 2 or street mostly, and it does seem to dust off =
all but the more modified mustangs in stoplight grand prix (i know, and =
yes i am a child).

does anyone out there have an idle screw for a dellorto carb? how about =
a whole parts carb (i'm using 45's but interested in any parts).  =
actually does anyone have any side draft carbs either =
(mikuni/weber/dellorto)  i'd like some for another car of mine?  does =
anyone out there have a stock style muffler?  i want to try and make a =
911 "sport" muffler, and need a stock (used) one to experiment with.

also,  i have poly bushings, 23 mm torsion bars on the front, 180 lb =
progressives on the back, and NO sway bars.  car feels very immediate, =
with neutral to slight oversteer.  i think i will keep this setup for =
this year, although i may try a 21 mm torsion bar (i like oversteer for =
solo 2).  i used the hoosier bias ply last year (225/45/15 front, =
245/45/15 on the back).  has anyone tried both the bias ply and the =
radials?  what do you think?

by the way, is anyone here in scca autocross coming up for our "AmCan" =
solo meet in ottawa this summer (u.s. counter part is in pittsburg)?
