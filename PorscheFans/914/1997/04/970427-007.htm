If you can't get a little dental mirror in there (with adequate light), you 
can try the "Braille" method:  What you're feeling for is a raised two-digit 
number in the casting.  Each number is about 1/2" high.   One number will be a 
"1", the other either a "7" or a "9."  Once you find the raised numbers, 
telling one from the other is easy.

You aren't gonna like this....

The size is cast into the body at the top near the plunger
(the side that goes towards the car.)

Don't know how you're going to see it without pulling it.
