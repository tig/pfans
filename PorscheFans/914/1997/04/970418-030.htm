Actually, I'm still not sure.  There's nothing obviously wrong, but I
haven't finished getting it completely apart yet.  Pushrods and valves
look okay.  Still haven't found how all the oil escaped.

For those of you who aren't Dave, the car in question is Dave's old 1.8L.
After 6 months of service, on its way home, it started smoking pretty
badly.  I pulled over, found it was leaking oil, and decided to try to
limp it home after putting more oil in.  The battery was too weak to turn
over the engine, so I pushed it to a nearby hill to roll-start it.  The
engine caught, but didn't have enough power for me to let the clutch out
in first (funny, it had enough power to get up the hill before I stopped
it).  Also, in the 5 minutes between adding the oil and checking the oil
again (30 seconds of that with the car running), I'd managed to lose
another 2 quarts of oil!  I decided to have the car towed home for
further diagnosis at more convenient time (instead of 2am after a 3 hour
drive).

In daylight, it looks like the left side of the deck lid and the top of
the right side of the engine were on the receiving end of lots of oil.
I've taken off the fan shroud, some of the sheet metal, distributor, coil,
alternator, clutch (but not flywheel), and have started on the intake
manifold.  Nothing I've seen yet looks like the cause of the problems,
but I'm not quite sure what I'm looking for.

In the meantime, a friend of mine found someone looking to get rid of a
running 1.7L motor so that he can put a 2.0L into the car instead.  I'm
hoping this will get the car running ASAP.
