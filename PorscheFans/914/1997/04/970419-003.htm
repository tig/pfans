Sorry, Jim.  I did a terrible job of making my point.  What I meant by
performance was reliability, in a waay.  As you explained, if you need to
increase the distance from the top of your piston to the deck of your
head, you can place shims either under the cylinder, or a head
gasket between the head and cylinder.  What I have heard is that the use
of the head gasket results in poor sealing, and causes even stock CR
motors to ping more than high-compression motors without the gasket.  Now,
I realize that I'm putting a lot of faith into something that I really
can't proove, especially since the idea of getting a better seal without a
head gasket sounds a little far-fetched.

When I took my engine apart the first time (a year ago) I observed the
head gaskets, and when I put it back together, I put new ones in.  I too
did not observe any leaking, and put head gaskets back in durring
reasembly.  I did not, however, use any sealing compound around the base
of the cylinder, and has me thinking, because there was no leaking there
either.  I'm begining to think that as long as the surface of your
cylinders and heads are clean and flat, that it probably won't make that
big of a difference where the shims and gaskets end up, as long as
everything is torqued properly.

Jim, I really appreciate your perspective here.  This is the second time
I've had to perform a top-end rebuild on my car in the one year that I've
owned it, and it's really breaking the bank.  I'd rather not do this every
year.  I began this rebuild with a "better safe than sorry" attitude, but
I've got  little more evidence now.  I spoke with Jim at GPR, and he
recommended that I not use a head gasket, and that I put a .030 shim
(rather than stacked .010s) under the cylinder.  Now, I've never spoken
with Jim before, but he claimed to have built 914 motors for 15 years, and
certainly sounded like he new what he was talking about.  Playing it safe
is always a good idea, but if I have an oportunity to not only increase
power, but possibly increase reliability, than I certainly don't want to
pass that up.  If I follow Jim's advice, than I will be looking at a
compression ratio right around 8.0 : 1, with a deck height of .037, which
is only .003 shorter than factory spec.  Yes, it will be a bit of an
experiment, and yes, I suppose there is the possiblity of damaging my
engine.  I am, however, willing to take that chance based on all of the
information I have received.  At the very least maybe we'll have proof
that you can't run without a head gasket!

Thanks for everyone's help and advice!
