	After several hours work on Saturday, and another two hours last
night, I finally have the brake pads replaced on *one* side.  Yes, I had
a couple of problems...
	Problem Number One:  Haynes sez "push out the retaining pins the
same way as the fronts, but note that each has a spring clip (picture)".
The picture shows a bent piece of wire.
	So, Dave takes his punch and hammer, and thumps on the end of the
retaining pin.  Nothing.  So, Dave POUNDS on the end of the retaining pin,
and hears, "PING-tink-tink-tink" as the spring clip flies off into the
recesses of the garage.  After more "persuasion", the pin comes out.  And
I notice that there is a hole through it, with some wire embedded within.
I pull on the clip for the other pin, and find out that it's just a cotter
pin!  (Well, OK, not quite--but simlar function!)  So I need another clip
for the retaining pin.
	Lesson #1:  Remove the "spring clips" first!
	Problem Number Two:  The new pads don't fit.  More precisely, the
top retaining pin doesn't fit through the hole in the pad.  Of course, it
takes 15 minutes of "persuasion" on the pin to figure this out...  Then I
get out the calipers and measure.  Nope, wrong size.  Verify that these
are, indeed, the correct pads.  Yup.
	I wander over to Pep Boys (hey, they're right by my house!) and
pick up a 5/16" drill bit--that's what the calipers said the pin was.  I
drill out the hole, and the pin *still* doesn't fit.  Well, not easily.
So I use the drill at an angle to open up the hole further....
	Lesson #2:  Use an 11/32" drill bit so the hole will be large enough
not to bind on the pin.
	Problem Number Three:  I can't remove the plug from the inboard
adjuster.  (Didn't ya see it coming?)  There's a hex-head, so no Allen
socket required.  However, the hex-head is offset in the hole so that I can
not put my 13mm socket on the silly thing!
	Try, try, try again, try loosening the caliper mounting bolts, use
"persuasion" (that's my copper mallet, BTW) on the bottom of the caliper to
move it upward...  No joy.  About an hour and a half of no joy, as a matter
of fact.
	Finally, I notice that there is a slight hesitation when my socket
gets down near the hex-head.  Hmmm.  So I use my finger as a depth gauge,
and notice that the socket goes further down than the top of the bolt-head.
And I still can't turn anything.
	Try a smaller socket.  Nope, it's not 13mm, it's 10mm.  Arrrgh!  It
comes out easily, I imagine a mocking laugh.  Turns out someone used some
plastic/epoxy/putty stuff to glue a 10mm-head bolt onto the plug.  More
Cheap Charlie at work!
	Lesson #3:  Don't assume bolt sizes.

	I don't think it will take nearly as long to do the other side, now.

	And my final lesson for the day:  I do *NOT* want to replace my rear
brake pads again.  Yech!
