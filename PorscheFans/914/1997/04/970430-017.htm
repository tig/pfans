Another alternative to the "extension tube" is a set of brass fittings stacked 
together (available at any LAPS).  I used three male-to-females to get almost 
up to the engine tin level, then a 45degree male-to-female to aim the sender 
away from the distributor, and a rubber grommet to provide an air seal around 
the fittings.  It's worked so far (the sender's not very heavy).  There is 
reason to use Teflon tape on the threads (oil leaks), and the threads 
apparently cut through the tape enough to provide the required electrical 
ground.

Sure. get the VDO combi pressure sender and switch with or without the 
extension tube. Use it in place of the oil pressure switch. Use the 
tubing extension if you dont' want to cut the engine tin, since it is 
fatter than the stock oil pressure switch.
