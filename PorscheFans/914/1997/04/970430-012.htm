Hey all,

	Well, I think I may have found a source for my repeating sudden power
loss problem. The copper braid ground wire in the dizzy is broken at the
solder joint. This at least may be the problem of minor intermittent
bucking as the throttle eases off to fully closed. As for the
every-minute-or-so total power losses that come back after about 10-15
seconds, that's hard to say. 

	Now I remember a few folks recently talking about just this problem and
what it could lead to. I know the dizzy is going to have to come out,
but is there going to be any serious reconstruction neccessary? I'm in a
bit of a bind right now. My parts bin is nothing like it used to be, and
my parts sources are not as close by as they used to be. If teh dizzy is
coming out, I will finally replace teh FI points which I have been
putting off, but what I'd like to know is if there is anything else that
I shoudl really be doing to the dizzy as long as it's out and being
worked on.

	I would really like to have the car ready by this weekend's autox.

Thanks,

-Josh2
