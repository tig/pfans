Mike mused:

>This is surely going to get me a flame, but here, I say it.

Ok! Click, click, click, sputter... Damn, the flame thrower's on the fritz.
Guess I'll have to rational about it then. :)

>The true gist of the 914 in competition is really the skill of the driver,
>the suspension, a fined tuned engine and just being lucky.

Very very true. Mostly it's the loose nut behind the wheel that will make a
car win or loose. 9 times out of 10 in fact.

>All the extreme mods do is mostly swell heads and put many genuine 914s on
>the future list for junk yards. Actually makes them worth less in most cases.

Yes. This is very true. But consideration needs to be taken into account on
who's doing these mods and why. For a stret driven car that is taken to the
track now and again, alot of these mods are simply attempts to bolt on
power. And many of these will wind up not working. Also, if the car is
going to be actively campaigned in a specific racing class, then attention
needs called to the fact these are now _race_ cars (as all porsches should
be :) and _must_ be treated as such. To trick out a car with racing
inspired mods and not maintain it as those mods require will put that car
in an early grave.

>I hear a lot of love for these Porsche breed and at the same time destroying
>them with half ass ideas and wild modifications.

Some of these wild ideas are completely in the spirit of, and neccessary
in, the class in which they compete. Others are just wild ideas that may or
may not bear friut in the end. I'm not against any wild idea if it's well
though out and can be delt with properly. But just throwing something in
tehre in the _hopes_ of more power, or whatever, is probably not the best
thing in the world to do.

Well put. Of course, if you want to race in Prepared or GT classes, then
you've got to pony up the dough to be competetive. Good driver or no, the
first straightaway will leave you sucking dust if you run a stock motor
against those fire breathers. BTDT <cough hack wheaze>...
