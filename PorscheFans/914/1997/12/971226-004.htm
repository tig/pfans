Greetings p-nuts,

Valves:
I KNEW somebody out there had another way of doing valves..I just couldn't
remember who.Well it turns out to be Jim T. outa Lancaster (we're gonna
hafta meet here soon-I'm about an hour north of you) and I am going to try
it his way - for better or worse.  As far as backfiring sources go, I
realize I could have some other problems too, as this engine has never been
apart (as far as I know and I have most of the records).  However, I don't
believe I have an exhaust leak simply because I haven't touched the heat
exchangers (yet)  I'm real familiar with the fresh  exhaust gasket routine
- went through all that on the other 914 I had.  But, nothng's getting
ruled out here...

Brakes:
Ja, turning the rotors is probably a real good idea - I'm doing that today
(friday)  I'm also going to try chamfering the edges of the pads, for what
it's worth, then coat the pad-backs (again) with anit-squeal and when it's
back toegther, I will take it up to about 50 and mash on the pedal hard to
seat the pads to the now-fresh rotors.  Sound like a good approach?  The
front calipers themselves are OK - I rebuilt those last year.

Anyway, Jim (et al) thanks for the help and I'll keep you posted on
progress (or lack thereof...)

Cheers
Thom Kuby
