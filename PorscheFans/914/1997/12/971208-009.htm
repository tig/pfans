	You'll need the whole works--heat exchangers (SSIs, whatever),
muffler, and muffler hanger.  I think the rest of the stuff (heater ducting
etc.) should bolt up, but I'm not certain about that.

	They changed the body panels slightly so that the rubber "lip" of
the bumper cover would hook onto the body.  (Or so I've read.)  I would
also guess that they didn't put the holes in the front of the wheel wells
for the bumper bolts to go through.  So at the least, you'll have to drill
eight holes (two per side per bumper).
	I know that someone, somewhere, makes fiberglass replicas of the
late style bumpers.  Have you considered one of those?  You might also try
to figure out a way to keep the rubber bumper cover, while removing all the
heavy metal behind it.
	Others on the list may have more experience with those mods.
