	I am told that a problem with very hard cam followers (or lifters,
or tappets) is that they start wearing the lobes of the cam down relatively
quickly.  Something to think about, if you do find those diamond tappets.
	I got my cam and lifters from FAT down in Southern Cal somewhere.
They are supposedly both hardened to an equal extent.  I did have one start
to come apart, though!  The cup-shaped piece that goes inside the lifter,
the part that the end of the pushrod fits into, wound up cocked at an angle
instead of laying flat.  This meant that the pushrod would not seat cor-
rectly, and cause me hours of puzzlement until I pulled out the lifter.
FAT did replace it at no charge.
	This happened at about the same time as the valve seat for that
particular valve let go, so the lifter failure could have been caused by
that--or could even (somehow??) have caused that.  Either way, *something*
was abused beyond its endurance.

	Perhaps that should go, "tappets should last the life of the *cam*"?
