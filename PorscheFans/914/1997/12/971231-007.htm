Not true! A -stock- 914 engine, and by that I mean a balanced and
blueprinted but still stock valvetrain, piston, crank etc, can spin up
to 7,000rpm with no damage. There won't be any power up there unless you
do something to the intake, but to say that the 914 engine can't spin up
to even 6,000rpm is wrong.

So do you intend on competing with this car? I thought you just wanted
to build a cool daily driver Drik? If you really are gonna track it,
read the rules. In some classes a mod like that might mean a big class
jump. Silly I know, but dems da rules sometimes.

That's why the adjustment is done when cold. It's taking into account
that the engine (and everything else) expands when hot and that the
clearances we use when cold will go away when it heats up.

Yes, hydraulic lifters are a great invention, and allow alot more
versatility. But I don't know the conversion for our motors too well,
and I'm wondering if it can handle higher rpm or not. I'd rather have a
lifter that's fixed and may not be ideal when cold than a lifter that
lags at high rpm.
