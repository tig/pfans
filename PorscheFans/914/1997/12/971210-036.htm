You need to measure the primary coil resistance. This is obtained by using
an ohm meter between the + and - terminals on the coil, with all other
wires disconnected. If the primary resistance is below about 2.5 ohms, then
the Pertronix will have trouble. If the resistance is above about 3.5 ohms,
you have an internal resistor and don't need a ballast resistor. I think
the Crane unit will handle low resistnace high energy coils better than the
Pertronix. But, if you add an MSD box with the Pertronix, then you can use
whatever damn coil you want, because the MSD box is electrically inserted
between the Pertronix and the coil. If you get the MSD box, please be smart
and get the MSD Blaster coil also. They don't cost very much. My dream
ignition system is the Compu-Fire dual coil pack. It replaces the points,
rotor, and cap and has 2 coils and doesn't mess up the tach like an MSD box
does. Of course, pleasure is not cheap, and the unit sells for about 190$.
