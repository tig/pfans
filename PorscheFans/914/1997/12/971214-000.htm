Hi Bill,
The 914 is a great and fun car. I have owned mine since '84 and have
enjoyed a bit of success autocrossing it over the years. I run it in CSP
because it has dual Dellortos and some suspension mods like higher rate
springs and urethane bushings etc. However, on a national level the 914
is outclassed in both stock and street prepared.

Another neat thing about Porsches is that Porsche Club of America have
their own autocrosses and events called Drivers Education which are run
on road racing circuits, so your opportunities for driving your car are
greatly enhanced over the other cars you could choose.

In stock we are saddled with running in BS against the Miatas. In CSP we
have the Miatas and CRXs and Civics to deal with.

Here's the problem. In stock you are driving a 24 year old car against
the latest and greatest in technology. It's pretty impressive that the
914 dominated this class for 20 years. Also, finding a 24 year old car
that is completely stock is almost impossible. There are so many
aftermaket parts that improve the 914 that national level competitors
have a field day protesting the 914. So if you get serious about prepping
a 914 for BS and want to run national level events, get ready to go to
the protest shed, especially if you do well.

In CSP you are limited to engine modifications that your competitors
don't have to deal with. For example, the rules state that no
modification of the stock heater system is allowed. That means that you
may not run headers on a 914. Therefore, even if you were to elect to
spring for those great aftermarket fuel injection systems that it won't
do any good because you can't get the exhaust gases out any better. Also,
the Hondas will weigh a good 400 lbs less than a 914.

Having said that, here's what you can do to the 914. In BS, put in the
biggest front Weltmeister adjustable sway bar and adjust the front end
down low. Put in competition Koni shocks all the way around. Align the
front end to 1/8th inch toe in and the rear 1/8th toe out. If you want to
drive the car on the street run the Hoosier Autocrosser bias ply tires
205/50 x 15s with 0 camber all the way around, that way when you put the
street tires back on they won't wear out.

In CSP do all the same as above except bite the bullet and put fender
flares on the car. Then get 10 inch wide rims all around and run 245/45 x
15 Hoosier Autocrossers. Try to get as light a wheel as possible. Get an
adjustable coil over kit for the rear spring/shock set up so you can
corner balance the car. "Sport" the stock muffler by taking it apart and
remove most of the baffles, then put a couple 2" stacks out the back of
the muffler and plug the stock outlet.

Don't even get tempted to remove the stock fuel injection system, it can
work great. Put an Allison or other optical trigger kit on your
distributor to get rid of the points. Don't go for the 009 distributor
because it won't work with your stock fuel injection. Spend your money
making the air flow into the injection system better.

On the suspension, get urethane bushings for all four corners and get
higher rate front torsion bars and rear springs, get stainless steel
brake lines and upgrade the master cylinder to at least th 19mm 911 unit.
Bypass the stock brake balance unit and put in an adjustable one.

I think a Quife torsen differential would do a lot for these cars but
they ain't cheap. $1600 for the unit plus the cost of installation.

If you do decide to spring for a 914 let me know. You may want to join
the 914 list to see what everyone else is doing.

BTW I'm taking the liberty of forwarding this letter to a bunch of other
914 racers who will add even more to my comments, I'm sure.

Good luck,
Ben Thatcher
