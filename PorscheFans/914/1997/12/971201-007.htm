I honestly don't know. But I'd be very very supprised if they weren't
adjustable. My guess it that it would be a similar type of adjustment,
but that's just a guess.

The early models (and most models as far as I know, I didn't know _any_
had adjustable rear plates though) did not have adjustable spring
plates. Although those are easilly available on the aftermarket scene. I
don't have any personal experience with them or with installing them.
But I'd say converting a stock 911 rear end is about as difficult and/or
time consuming as converting a 914 rear end to do the same. Different
problems, but I think they'd even out in the end.

I personally prefer the coil spring setup. For a couple reasons. One,
ease of replacement. I can swap out a set of springs in the rear of my
914 in about 45 minutes flat (both sides). I don't think it's quite that
easy to do so in a 911, I could be wrong though. And two, cost. I can
buy a set of coil springs for the rear of a 914 for about $110 a pair,
any weight, new. Just _try_ to find new torsion bars for that price,
much less hollow/gundrilled ones. Which suspension design is better?
Hmm, that's pretty tough to pick. Certainly the coil suspension is more
popular currently, hence cheaper. But I don't think I have enough
suspension design knowledge to make a decision there. They both have
their pros and cons.
