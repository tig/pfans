	If the problem with the stuck wheels is not the lug bolts (we
have had several fine suggestions about loosening stuck fasteners),
but that the rims are stuck to the hubs (happened to me and two other
people I know), there are several things you can do.
	I was able to get my one stuck rim off of the hub with some
hard kicks.  I wouldn't do this again, because the kick that finally
freed the wheel also started the car rocking on the jackstands.
	Another person I know used a dead-blow mallet on the rim.  It
took a fair amount of beating, but eventually came off.
	Finally, the third person loosened his lug-bolts VERY VERY
slightly, and drove the car for a bit.  When he heard extra rattling/
clunking noises, he knew his rim was free.

	Interesting trivia:  In all three cases, it was a Fuchs rep-
lica rim stuck on the right-front hub.  Two different sets of wheels,
three different cars.
