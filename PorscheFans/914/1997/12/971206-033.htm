	I sent in a request for insurance quote to AIG and I got
back a letter that says "please provide  cost new  of Porsche".
I  had read it first as "cost of new porsche" and  was going to
be a smart alec  and say  $44,000 because  that was the  sticker on
the  Boxter  I sat  in last  month.
	I don't even  know why they care.  If  they read  the  application,
they would  see  that I don't  want  collision or comprehensive  on this car,
they would never be asked to repla it.
	On the off chance that it makes a difference, does anbody know?
It's   a  75 with a 1.8l.   Yhe only options I can think of is california
emissions and tartan cloth seat inserts.  Thanks for your help.

Bernie

Very good suggestion!  I'm all for the idea that we should all try to get to
know each other a little better.  This list is a great tool for each of us.
I think it goes without saying but I'm going to do it anyway.  The 914ers I
have met in the years I've been lucky enough to enjoy the car have, in almost
all cases, been wonderful people.  Some have turned out to become my very best
friends.  I know from reading this page that many people have come to meet
each other in this last year.  As years pass family and friends become more
important to me and I suspect its the same for many of you also.  Count me in
on the Intros. and I encourage every one else, especially those of you out
there that are only readers of this 914 thread, to let others know who you are
and what your 914 interrests are.

Season's greeting everybody............Rich
