To All With new toys (computers with internet)

How many times does it have to be put on the list messages before it sinks
in that there are two things that really screw up the list for everybody. 

1. Cross posting of messages
2. Attaching files.

I have to assume that this is being done by newer people on this list or
illiterates that cannot read.

If you feel the need to post to every list write one message, copy it
(Ctrl-C) post to one list, start a new message, paste your very important
message ((Ctrl-V) to new message and then address it to another individual
list.  Not to complicated and it keeps everyone on the list for instantly
hating your guts.

Likewise attached files to a digest list are about as useless as...(you
fill in the blank)
It is close to impossible to take the file and translate it.

PLEASE NO MORE CROSS POSTINGS OR ATTACHED FILES.
