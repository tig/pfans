	Thanks,
	That is what I am looking for.  What I need are names.  There
just doesn't seem anything with high speed ratings (or fun quotients)
in the sizes we need.
	On the subject of 205-50s, were they on stock wheels and if
so was there any concern for clearance on the inside.  I know it
wouldn't be a problem with the VW offsets (the question is fender
clearance there).
	I don't care how far the speedometer is off.  It allready
indicates 80 when going 72.  I don't like the Idea of a continous
3400-3500rpm for four or five hours on trips.
