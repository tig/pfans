Hi all, I'm Ben Thatcher
I live in the Atlanta, GA area now but lived in Las Vegas when I finally
got my first 914 back in 83. It's a 73 1.7 with a 2.0 engine now, yep I
still own this car. Right after I bought the car I went through a divorce
(unrelated subject) and had to rebuild the motor in the ex-wife's garage.
After I got it together I moved it to my apartment and started
autocrossing it and taking women out on dates with it. It was neat for
that because the inside passenger door latch didn't work 8-)).

I met my current wife autocrossing so I don't have the usual battles
about my car fetish. She loves the car and likes flogging it. Once we got
married my 914 started having babies. At one time I owned 4 of them. It
was cheaper to get the parts off them than go to AA or the other parts
sources. I even had one 72 that had a perfectly rust free body that I had
put flares on and stripped all the excess weight off getting it ready to
build as a race car.

But we decided to move to Georgia in 94 so some cars had to go. I kept
the 73 and traded the flared 72 for another 2.0 motor plus a coil-over
set. I kept a bunch of parts from the other cars but sold the cars.

I currently autocross my 73 in SCCA CSP (don't tell 'em it's technically
not legal) and PCA I-1. It has adjustable Weltmeister anti rollbars front
and rear (rears are unhooked), coil over rears with adjustable spring
height, 140# rear springs, poly bushings in the rear (replaced dusted
original bushings) and Revolution 7" wheels designed to fit under stock
wheelwells, SS brake lines, turbo tie-rods, 19 mm brake master cylinder,
Konis. The engine is stock but with dual Dellorto 40s. The muffler has
been "sported" with many baffles removed and two 2" outlets in the
middle. Luckily, Georgia only smogs down to '75 so I'm free to do what I
want with this car.

I'm about to build some more garage space so I can start to look for
another one. This will be a race car to pick up where I left off with the
flared 72 I used to have. Perhaps this car will get all my Porsche
engines so I can swap a Rotary into my 73 or vice versa.

I love working on these cars. I've had the engine/transaxle out of the
car about 10 times so have that drill down pat. I'm not tempted to buy a
911 like most of my PCA friends seem to think I should. IMHO the 914
handles much better and is even better looking. I've always loved them
from the first photo I saw of one back in 69.
