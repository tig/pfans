Hi all
     My name is Brad and I live in Lenexa Ks, a suburb of Kansas City.  Yes,
a BIG Chiefs fan:>  I'm married to a wonderful patient wife who is getting
used to the sound of a wrench being thrown across the garage floor.  We have
two teenage boys who just keep asking when the Porsche is going to be finished.
     My first experience with a 914 was in 1973.  A friend of mine got one
for a birthday present, and I was in love.  Unfortunately it was 24 years
later until I was able to get my own.  It's a 74 1.8 with a lot of rust, in
fact my wife tells people that it's a pile of rust in the shape of a
Porsche.  It's going to take a lot of work, but I didn't pay anything for it
and I have the garage space, so I thought I'd go for it.  I got the engine
out last weekend and will start working on the battery compartment rust
next.  Anyway I'm sure glad I found this list, your a great bunch.

Happy Holidays
Brad
