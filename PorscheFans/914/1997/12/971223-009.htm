Ben,

Stock offsets would work just fine for a flared 914 in the sizes you
mentioned. Do you already have flared fenders on your car? If not
Revolution makes a 15x7 that fits under the stock wheelwells. You can
even mount 225/50x15s with a little stretching of the rear wheelwells
(commonly known as the "ball batting" technique).

Subject: 4 lug wide wheel question

Hi Guys,

AutoAtlanta advertises the performance brand minilite looking wheels for
the 4
lug 914 pattern with the fender flares in 15 by 7 and 15 by 8. AA's price
is
over $1000 without shipping. If I can find out the offset etc... I would
need
for a flared 914 I can buy directly from the importer for less than $600
including shipping. Does anyone know this info? I'm looking for bolt
pattern,
offset, backspacing anything I would need to order the rims and what
tires
sizes fit. I don't want to go to the 5 lug and like the minilite look on
a 914
(Trying to be period correct.)

Please reply to me at dmer@aol.com and the list.


Thanks,
Ben

Hi Ben,

I do already have flared fenders and the car has a custom made set of 14 inch
wheels on now. I want to be able to move up to 15 inch tires. Do you know what
hte stock offset is? Do you know the bolt pattern?
