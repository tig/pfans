Ho Ho Ho.
    My name is Jim Sucharski and I own a '75 2.0 which I've had for
about two years (almost) which I bought from the original owner, an old
family friend who used to do the books for the Porsche Audi dealer in
Syracuse, N.Y. It was her 3rd 914, and it was also her first choice
among Porsche models available at the time she worked there. I bought
the car after it had been sitting in her garage for about 5 years, and
drove from Iowa on my vacation to upstate N.Y. with a trunk full of
tools and tune-up items and put on a new set of Yokohamas, tuned it,
replaced  most of the fuel lines, and drove it about 750 miles home.
Since then, I've put new clamshell reinforcements in to
replace/strengthen some rusty spots on the inner rockers, added Fuchs
alloys, early style SSI heat exchangers and a Bursch exhaust, SS brake
lines and 19 mm master cylinder. This past September, my wife Heather
and I attended the 914 Club meet in Branson and had a blast meeting many
of the people on this list, and 914 owners from all over the US and from
Canada and the UK as well, super fun. Car ran at 75-90 miles an hour
most of the way there and back without any serious problems, and when I
hit the Iowa border coming home, got pulled over for the above, and
didn't even get a ticket. That was a perfect trip.
    When my younger son turned 17 last year we went car shopping for his
first car, and by fate and good luck he wound up with a nice little '73
1.7 that just happened to be the best car available for the  money, and
when he test drove it, he was instantly at home with the car, never
stalling or bucking, just Mr. Smooth from the first time he drove it. In
fact, I enjoy riding with him driving in that car as I never have with
any other driver or car. Unfortunately, he is apparently unable to drive
an automatic transmission, and may have to stick with the Porsche brand
his whole life. (I haven't tested him with a Tiptronic).
    My job is that of Quality Manager at a Kodak photo processing lab,
where I am responsible for all the technical aspects of Lab operation,
and I have been at this for almost twenty years. I have lived in New
York, Florida, Arizona, Mississippi, and Iowa during that time, and have
been married to my wife Heather for 22 years. I have two sons, Aaron,
now a car salesman, and an unrepentant 5.0 Mustang maniac, and Matthew,
owner of the 1.7.  We have an interesting driveway and garage, with a
'92 Taurus SHO as my daily driver, my wife's 626 turbo, both 5 speeds.
The two 914's, and my '78 Triumph Bonneville, and Matt's '77 Honda 550F
Supersport.
    I am looking forward to the next 914 Owners club meet next fall,
probably in Hot Springs AK.
                                                              Don't
forget Who put the X in Xmas.
                                                `                Jim S.
