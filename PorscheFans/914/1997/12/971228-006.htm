Greg,

More things to check:

1)  Are the tires "cupped"?  If they didn't wear flat, they will
vibrate.
    (Try rotating the tires front<->rear.)
2)  Are the rims bent?  If not, are they torqued on right?
    (Mounting rims on a 914 correctly requires a torque wrench)
3)  Are the bearings OK?  They're not expensive, and they're easy
    to get in wrong.  Check the play.
4)  Are you sure the wheels are balanced correctly?  Yeah, they probably
    are, but.....
5)  Alignment.  Where did you have it done?  With my 914, the biggest
    problem was finding a shop that could do the work, and didn't have
    the attitude:  "It's just a 914, who gives a sh*t."

Happy Hunting,
Gary.
