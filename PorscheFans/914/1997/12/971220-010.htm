Hi guys,

I've been watching this thread and thought I'd jump in real quick.

Hydraulic tensioners offer one major advantage over a mechanical mechanism:
They not only compensate for wear but they maintain proper tension over the
heat cycle of the engine. Remember, there is quite a distace between the
crankshaft sprocket and the cam sprocket and as the engine heats up, this
distance grows. So with a mechanical adjustment, the best you can do is to
compromise between the chain being too loose when the engine is cold and
too tight when the engine is hot. But at best, it will be a little of both.
The concern over having the additional oil lines to worry about is
understandable, but the lines that feed the Carrera tensioners is just a
"T" off of the existing cam tower lines. As far as the increase of tension
proportionate to oil pressure, I suspect that the viscosity and temperature
of the oil in the tensioner body is more of a factor than the pressure of
the oil entering it. The _tensioning_ is done by a spring, the _damping_ is
done by the oil.

I'd like to tell you that this was all of my own found wisdom, but this is
something I learned while attending the Bruce Anderson/Jerry Woods course a
couple of years ago. And in fact, they also mentioned that in certain race
engines that some people felt that the pressure fed tensioners were _more_
prone to failure than the non-pressure fed style. Of course, these engines
would presumably be torn down frequently and the tensioners could be
inspected/replaced often. I don't think that mechanical tensioners were
recommended in any circumstance.

Happy Holidays,

john
