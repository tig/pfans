I'm looking for people who can write short articles and/or send me good
pictures and stories about their Porsche cars.  This is a gratis thing
(your name in lights only) for the newsletter of the Central Indiana
Region newsletter for PCA.  I'm especially interested in hearing from
CIR PCA members, residents of Indiana and the midwest areas, but
articles and tech tips are welcome from anyone.  Repeat:  Anyone...
For example the series regarding 944 Turbo boost controllers would be
welcome, even if it had to be broken up over several issues....
	Also, I am looking for advertisers for this newsletter.  The CIR PCA
distribution list runs over 400, and the newsletter will also be on the
web starting in January, hopefully.  Please contact me for rates.

					Thanks!

					Dana

PS:  I need to hear from CIR PCA members about the newsletter even if
you don't want to contribute articles.  What would you like to see, what
have you most and least liked about the newsletter in the past and do
you/have you ever actually read it?  Also, we need someone to stick
stamps and mailing labels on 400+ copies of newsletter every month as
the person who has been doing this is a bit bored after three years of
service.
						Thanks!

I hope this doesn't turn into a repeating message!

Hi Guys,

AutoAtlanta advertises the performance brand minilite looking wheels for the 4
lug 914 pattern with the fender flares in 15 by 7 and 15 by 8. AA's price is
over $1000 without shipping. If I can find out the offset etc... I would need
for a flared 914 I can buy directly from the importer for less than $600
including shipping. Does anyone know this info? I'm looking for bolt pattern,
offset, backspacing anything I would need to order the rims and what tires
sizes fit. I don't want to go to the 5 lug and like the minilite look on a 914
(Trying to be period correct.)

Please reply to me at dmer@aol.com and the list.


Thanks,
Ben
