     Hi "Mr Bill"
     
     
       Saw your posting, sounds like you have a really nice Ghia...don't 
     let that one get away EVER!!!  The 914 shares identical suspension 
     geometry in front with the 911.  In fact, the front suspension
     ASSEMBLY is an identical/interchangeable "bolt-up".  If you've ever
     peeked under a Super Beetle, the suspensions are similar, both have 
     lower A-arms that pivot longitudinally along the front to back (of 
     car) axis.  There is no (tow friendly) transverse beam like the
     Beetles and Ghias.  I'd imagine that a tow bar geared to the 911
     would (or could be made) to work, the only differences between the
     cars might be in the overhang of the front bumpers.  I'm trying to 
     think of a way you can hook up the the A-arms without limiting their
     motion as they roll down the road and react to bumps etc. None comes
     to mind.  Last time I towed my 914 it was with a two-wheeled dolly.
     
     I've also yearned for the convenience that came with a 5 minute hook 
     up to tow my hot-rodded beetle.
     
     If you get any replies with a source, I'd like to hear about it also
     Please!!  I'm going to be doing some bodywork and paint where towing
     will be necessary.
     
     
     hoping to hear from you.  If you get no replies, let me know, I have 
     access to full machine/welding shop and am a Mechanical Engineer
     by trade.  Would be willing to design and fabricate a limited
     run of tow bars if there aren't any out there already especially for 
     911's/914's.
     
     
     take care
