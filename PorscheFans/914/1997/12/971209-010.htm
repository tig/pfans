	Well, Baby is much more happy with a new battery now.  The old
one wouldn't hold a charge, and then wouldn't even take a charge.  I
had it out of the car (cold concrete floor, I know that's bad for it)
on the 2 amp charger overnight, and 1 hour after I unplugged it the
voltage across the terminals was 10.75 V.  That, my friends, is one
*DEAD* battery.
	For JJ--I jump-started the car (using my roommie's truck), and
drove the car to the store the battery had come from.  No problems.
That's one more piece of anecdotal evidence for you--and this time, I
had the Allison ignition in there.  The voltage didn't drop all the
way down this time, because my charging system is OK, but it's another
piece of info for ya.
