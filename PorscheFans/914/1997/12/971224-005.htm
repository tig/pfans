I can sympathise. When I was getting my first rebuild, I bought a
rebuilt tranny from (company name withheld, but they're a big P-car
parts house). The first one I got from them had a wasted R&P and howled
like crazy. The second had a really bad 4th gear, and within 50 miles
4th gear locked up and would not come out, at all. It was a poorly
alligned shift fork, and it locked up under load and wouldn't free up.
It's actually quite easy to screw up a 901 box from what I've been told.
That's why transmission work is the only thing I won't willingly do on
my own.

I do wish you luck on your work. And I'm sure there are a few hardy
souls here on the list who have tackeld and succeded at transaxle
rebuilds.
