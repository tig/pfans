<<$4k for a clean and straight 2.0L with autox goodies is really
stretching it. Maybe if you find one with a shot engine or tranny, but
not likely. A decent one, requiring some restorative work, with a
straight chassis, and stock suspension, could be found however. The best
thing to do is keep looking. I looked for months before getting mine,
and it did need some serious work, but the chassis was clean and
straight.

I couldn't agree more.  The days of finding a clean straight 73-74 2.0 for
$4000 are probably well behind us, some exceptions for California may exist
however.  If I were looking for a very clean, straight, nice 73 or 74 2.0
that was set with auto-x goodies, I would recommend a budget in the
$6000-$7500.  You may get lucky and find a good car cheaper, but the fact
remains that very good 2.0's are getting harder and harder to find,
especially unmolested cars with no damage history.  Also not to forget what
it costs to set up the suspension and brakes for auto-x is going to run you
at least $1000.  Just my 2c
