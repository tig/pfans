Brian M. is right about advice. .
So is Dave D.
and Dirk W.

My observation:
(from the standpoint of a fossil of the porschephile list)
 -is that the network and expanding availability of pc's and
internet providers has given us all a larger, more knowledgable
(and opinionated) population on the p-fan lists.

Sociologically, there will always be folks who are more, or less
in any given aspect of the Porsche experience.  It is nice to see
that some know more than others, but is it good to remain silent
until someone posts and then jump on the messenger rather
than the message?

If you should know so much more about some detail, please
educate us.  The void beckons.

I am not the best, nor the worst.  I am just another blunt-skull.
(same as every one of you)
Kyle Ehler  -914's and a smashed 944. .
(did it need to be said, yes.  did i have to say it, yeah.) :(
Road Rage:  everyone should have a steering wheel hit them
in the chest once (hard!) to remind them how mortal they are.

Since I'm in the digest mode I can't respond immediately but then I can also
avoid the repeating messages. anyway. The discussions about mice are quite
relevant. When I took my car out of storage after 13 years I had a rusted out
battery tray and support and some rust on the suspension console. No the
battery was taken out of the car the day it went into storage. Cause of the
rust? 13 years of mouse piss. (Seems the little buggers nest kind of works
like a sponge.
