>>Hi All, Merry Christmas, 
>>Well hope everyone got a Porsche part under the tree ?? If you did, tell
>>us about it. In fact someone's wife was looking for GT Flares...Anyone
>>get Flares for xmas ??
>>

Yep, that was me!  Thanks to my wonderful Wife and a fellow list member, I
now have a set of glass GT flares sitting in the garage.  I plan to attach
them using dusz fasteners for easy removal, and to totally avoid the whole
cracked paint problem!  I don't care much about making the car look like a
GT replica.  If this car has to compete in AP land, it better well start
acting like it...

I also got a new helmet painted to match my car with a hand-painted picture
of Speed Racer on the side. My Wife's idea, my Father's talent.  One last
thing, a remote controlled Boxster from the Sharper Image catalog.  I
haven't gotten a chance to play with it yet, but it looks to be of pretty
good quality.  Maybe my Wife is sending me a message?

What did everyone else get?

:)))
