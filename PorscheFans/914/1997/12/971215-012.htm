I'm still up in the air on thew issue of head gaskets.  The only person that
I talked to that recommended their use was a guy out at GPR.  All of the
mechanics that I talked to said it was personal preference.  The only person
that highly recommended not using them was someone at Mark Stephen's High
Performance.  His explanation was that not only do you get a little higher
compression without them, you also eliminate a big cause of misfiring.  He
said something about the gasses heating the gasket up and it acting like a
glow plug.  When I rebuilt my top end, I decided to go without the head
gasket, but for anyone following this route, I recommend you check
everything first.  I cc'd my heads to discover that they've been fly cut.
In addition, my deck height was substantially lower than what had been
reported as normal.  If I had simply run the .010 base gasket without a head
gasket, there's a good chance my pistons and valve would have collided when
then engine got warm.  Make sure that whatever you decide to do, you've got
enough clearance.  I think the minimum accepted deck height is about .035,
but of course some claimed it could be as low as .027, and others insisted
nothing less than .040.
