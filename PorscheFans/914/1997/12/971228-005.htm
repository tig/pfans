Josh,

To the best of my knowledge, there's no such thing as "factory" AC.  It
was all dealer installed.

The condensor was mounted in the front trunk where the spare tire used
to be.  (The spare was moved to the back trunk.)

You really don't want to duplicate this; it involves removing the floor
of the front trunk.  Goodness knows what structural problems result.

$.02,
Gary
