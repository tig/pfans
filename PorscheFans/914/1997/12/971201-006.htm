Great to see that the list has become a bit more robust. I guess Der
Listmeister doesn't like all the attention this gets anyway.

Well, my new suspension is in! MAN! What a difference! Even untuned it's
incredible. The car is SOOO much more responsive, and turn-in is
fantastic now. As a matter of fact, turn-in is _so_ good that I kept
clipping apex cones at the autox a week ago. It seems to be pretty damn
close to neutral right now, with just a little too much oversteer. But
the sway bar is still set pretty soft in front and I think that should
pretty much fix that puppy right up. Now if only the weather will warm
up for the trials event this weekend. Cold tires at high speed aren't
the best way to test a new suspension... =8-O

The best thing about it is that I no longer find the need to run the
shocks so damn stiff. I used to run the fronts at almost full stiff, and
the rears just a little less. Now I can run the shocks at nearly full
soft, and still get plenty of response. That's how it _should_ be. No
more skating over little bumps when autoxing. :)
