You won't mess up compression by pulling the pistons, but chances are you'll
never get the used set of rings to seat again.  After checking on it for
quite some time when I did my last top-end, it was pretty much a consensus
that to be safe, you'd better re-ring the pistons if you pull them out of
the barrels.  In addition, it was also recommended that you do a quick
honing of the cylinders just to break up the glaze.  As far as measuring the
deck height goes, I was noticing the same thing with the imperceptible
ridge.  I was told that you'll never get an accurate reading unless you use
a solid flat edge across the top of the piston, while sliding feeler gauges
under it.  In addition, it is critical that the cylinder is bolted down to
the case.  Low and behold, they were right.  When I "guesstimated" the
reading without bolting the cylinder down, and without a flat-edge, I got
..007 in. clearance.  With it bolted down and using the flat edge, it
suddenly became .023 in.  Pretty big difference.  Be careful when bolting
the cylinder down, though.  Those fins break really easy.
