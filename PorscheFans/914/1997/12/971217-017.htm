	On the coatings--I didn't mean you might want to keep the
idea of *FI* in mind, Dirk.  I know you're a confirmed carb man,
and I won't try to change you.  (Yes, we love you just the way you
are!   ;^)   What I meant was that the heat-transfer issue may be
worth thinking of.  If you have carbs, then it doesn't affect your
mixture the way it does for FI cars, but it *may* affect other
parts of engine performance.

	On the hi-po 1.7 FI--you *can* make the stock FI work with
a built 1.7 motor.  Kjell Nelin did; check his story in the Tech
Refs section of Tim's Fan page.  JJ mentioned there were some DNS
problems with the page, but told us the numeric address.
	The big thing with that is that you need a way to measure
the fuel mixture.  Kjell used an oxygen sensor, I believe.  If you
don't have one, then it will be a WHOLE LOT of work--getting the
car to a certain operating conditions, then killing the motor and
pulling the plugs to look at the color...  Over and over and over.
Yech.
	You can also get partway there (if your motor becomes a
1.9 L, which is a popular big-bore size) by using 2.0 injectors.
You'll still need some tweaking, though.
	Valve timing is not really an issue with any 914/4 fuel
system--the D-jet puts fuel into the intake ports on half of the
cylinders at 180 degrees out of phase.  The L-jet keeps putting
fuel into the intake ports every 180 degrees, so everybody gets
multiple squirts anyway.  And carbs, of course, just keep metering
the fuel on in whenever they feel like it.

	It *is* possible to modify the stock 1.7 D-jet system to
cope with a "built" motor.  I never claimed it was easy.
