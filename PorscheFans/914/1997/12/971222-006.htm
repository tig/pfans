     Hi Garold
     
        I'm doing a 3.0SC >>> '76 2.0 Conversion right now.  Your message 
     asked for advice on whether a conversion ('74) was done correctly. 
     While I'm no expert (but this list does have a few) here is a list of 
     desireable features gleaned from all my research.  Hopefully, the 
     really experienced guys who have done this well will also pipe in.  
     Anyhow, I'll comment only on the items I've got a high degree of 
     confidence/experience on:
     
     1) Emissions system: will it pass in your state?  In CA, you must 
     transfer the engine as a "system" so all smog equip that came with the 
     model year of the 911 with that 2.7 must be intact.  Also, the 
     emissions must meet the tighter requirement of either the model year 
     for the engine, or the model year for the body.  If these ducks aren't 
     in line (at least in Ca), make sure you know what it will cost you to 
     comply, otherwise, it takes ALL the fun out of it.
     
     2) Rear Suspension - pre '73 914/4 hubs drilled to the 5 lug pattern 
     make for a very "factory" conversion.  The '70-72 hubs all had both 4 
     and 5 lug boss patterns cast into the hub to allow drilling either one 
     on the same casting.  When the 914/6 was dropped, the hub design was 
     changed to have only 4 bosses.  Many people race their cars with '73 
     or newer hubs (4 bosses) drilled out to 5 lugs, and claim that there 
     is no problem.  Springs also need to be upgraded since you are 
     carrying more weight with the 6 and have a significantly higher power 
     range to play with.  
     
     3) Rear Brakes - the "nicest" setup is to have genuine 914/6 rear 
     calipers and rotors. It is clean and retains your parking brake.  A 
     second "cleanest' method is to have spacers machined to spread the 
     914/4 calipers apart in order to fit the wider 911 5 lug rotors 
     (vented but same diameter as 914/4).  The third is to have custom 
     adaptors machined, or slice off the old mounting points and weld on 
     new ones on your swing arms to mount any caliper of your choice 
     (including BIG Brakes).  The fourth option (at least in my book) is to 
     buy yourself the Vellios setup.  It is basically the rear hubs and 
     brakes from a 911 (including the mini-drum parking brakes) and 
     associated mods to the swing arms to accomadate them.  The drive 
     shafts for a 911 are different, so the CV's need to be changed also.
     This is very clean, but not cheap.
     
     4) Oiling System - stock OEM 914/6 oil tank is cleanest.  Aux. Oil 
     cooler (especially in nose of car) is highly desireable.
     
     5) Engine - OEM sheetmetal most desireable, (will look cleanest).  
     Mounting system, many will argue that the Quick-Six style is prone to 
     breakage and that the engine-bulkhead mount style of the OEM 914/6 is 
     the only way to go.  I believe a Quick-Six style can be made to work, 
     you just need a Bigger tube!
     
     6) Instrumentation - 914/6 gages cleanest, most expensive, 911 gages 
     will do the job very well, center console very desireable to 
     accomadate the necessary extra head temp. oil pressure, oil temp 
     gages.  Conversion from 914/4 steering head to 914/6 eliminates "on 
     the stalk ignition" and ignition is installed on left of wheel a-la 
     911, 914/6.
     
     7) Body, no changes needed, steel GT flares VERY nice, as well as 
     Steel or 'glass flared rocker panels.  Flares allow much more rubber.
     
     8) Wheels- pretty much your choice.
     
     9) Transaxle - 916 conversion (915 converted to sideshift) nicest and 
     most durable.  Allows usage of ALL 5 gears and thus most flexibility 
     (see Vellios$$$$$$)  901 will do the job, again sideshift is the 
     ticket 1st gear however must be babied and in my book, makes it 
     impractical for a proper semi-bulletproof STREET car.  914/6 racers 
     will argue that they never use 1st gear, this makes it a four speed as 
     far as I am concerned however.  Recent Rebuild and limited slip added 
     bonuses.
     
     
     
     That is about all I feel qualified to comment on.  My conversion goals 
     are to build something the factory might have made in '76 or later, 
     not to replicate the '70-'72 914/6's.  I want a very durable street 
     car, with weekends on the Autocross circuit. I'm keeping my Honking 
     Big Bumpers ('76) since they really do work in everyday traffic 
     (already survived one 5++++++MPH collision!)
     
     Enjoy
