But, But, But, Jeff, ???
I have two buddy's running Factory GT flares on six conversion cars with
Factory 930 9's in the rear and they dont rub ?? I even watched one car
get them welded on and nothing was done to make them set out a little
more, just set the factory flares on the stock 914 fender, cut alittle
and butt weld, cut alittle more and butt weld and on and on. I know
these cars are all a little different, so what gives ?? 
So I put down the big bucks for 9's that I cant use ?? Jeff I hope your
wrong, cuz I just love these 9's and really want to run them, I just
hope my car is like my buddy's cars and they tuck under...
Fingers crossed, 
 Don

hey everyone,

somehow in the course of an hour and a half, i managed to loose my ignition
key.  upon searching my house up and down for the spare and not finding it, i
realized that i could have a serious problem brewing.  what can i do?  is
there any trick to duping a key by using the ignition as a guide?
