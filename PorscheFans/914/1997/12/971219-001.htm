Finally - a non-technical subject I can respond to with my $.02 -
(without having to call someone to get their technical input (I'm
referring to the shift bar 6 conversion thread I inadvertently started
:-)

I don't know which AA catalog you're referring to (I got two - a big
white one and smaller 914 specialized..) but, as a 914 "new guy", I
thought they were outstanding!  I have PP, Automation, AJ-USA,
Stoddards, Tweeks, etc. (I've got a number of these for other P'cars)
and those others are horrendous in their 914 coverage (if they are even
included at all).

The AA catalog (big one especially) intermixes 914 history articles
(mostly color) with their parts, and the parts explosions which actually
helped me out as I tore apart my car - none of the others had these to
AA's degree of detail. Maybe I'm a sucker for big, thick, well presented
and printed catalogs (especially compared to Tweeks!) -  but I'd spend
the $ again just to get the articles, the history of 914-GTs and other
specialized 914s.

Now, if I compare the PP 914 catalog to the AA 914 smaller 914 catalog -
it certainly appears PP would rather sell me accessories than hard parts
or "rustoration" panels and the stuff I actually need to get the 914
back together.  Thanks, I'll take the AA catalog over any of the others.

Just my $.02
