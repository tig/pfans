Nick, Dirk, et al,

When any engine sits for a long time, it often takes a bit of "running in"
before you can really tell it's condition.  If you do a compression test
right now, I'll bet that you'd get wildly different readings between
cylinders.  If you run the engine for a couple hours, (ie drive the car for
50-100 miles) and then do a compression test, you will see *much* better
compression numbers for 2 reasons:
1.  The engine is now hot.
2.  The engine is run-in again, and the cylinders are oiled, the crud that
was
     on the cylinder walls is cleaned off somewhat, the valves that were
stuck
     open when the engine was stored are now re-seated, yada yada yada...

Now, I'm not saying that an engine with crappy compression readings is a
good engine. I'm just saying that compression readings on an engine that sat
around for a while (a year or more) doesn't tell you much.

What you decide to do at this point boils down to 2 things:
1. partial tear-down, and possibly overhaul the engine if you get
    shipwright's disease.
2. toss the engine into the car as-is, and then drive for a couple hours,
    check compression, leakdown, etc. to find the engine's condition.

I know what I'd do, because this is going to be a very special project car,
but it's easy to go way over the top.  It really depends on your philosophy
towards project cars.  Are you the fix-all-at-once type, or are you the
fix-and-drive type?

Happy Holidays, Brian Ng
