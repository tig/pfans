	Well, a fan and some "stretched aluminum" mesh stuff would probably
go quite a way toward protecting the cooler.  And I would think you'd want
a fan on it, controlled either with a thermostat, or a cockpit switch.  (If
you work the switch according to the temp gauge, you're acting as "The Ol'
Meat Servo", to put it in aviation terms...)

	Remember that the Factory race cars had something like eights and
tens under their fender flares.  They may very well have been custom-offset
wheels (like the 911R had), or the fenders may not have been the same as
the commonly-available GT ones.  But you may be able to find some wider
ones from somewhere that will let you put the WIDE wheels on.

The AVS doesn't come in a 245. The 255/45 has the same overall diameter as the
225/50. If both front and rear are 50 series, there is a height difference of
..787 inches as opposed to 50 and 45 series which would be .177 inches. Is the
height difference that big of a deal? I don't want to make mistakes with
tires, they are too expensive. Would the 205/55/15 and 225/50/15 combination
be the wisest choice? This is the most common arrangement that I see on GT
Flared 914's with 7&8 inch wheels.
Thanks again,
