Dion, 

	While never having done the build myself, I have stood and watched over
the shoulder of the fellow who rebuilt my tranny. One big gotcha I can
tell you about is the paper gasket under the end cover of the transaxle.
When you pull the endcover off, it's very important to accurately
measure the thickness of this gasket(s). This is how the R&P backlash is
set from the factory.

	Apart from that, I really can't say as I didn't get to watch the whole
process, just parts of it. Good luck on your rebuild.
