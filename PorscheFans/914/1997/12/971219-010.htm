I think the new AA catalog looks pretty sharp, although dissapointingly like
some others,
and I can't find things I'm interested in as easily. I felt the old one was
unique, like
a special interest group.
However,
George & Co. should be commended as I imagine it was a fair amount of work
to produce.
I was glad to see the pictures and articles from the previous 914 catalog were
included as I enjoy rereading them from time to time, for inspiration and ideas,
and this can only promote a greater appreciation of the 914 to owners of other
Porsche models. Just my opinion.
