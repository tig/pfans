All- Well, I'm late, as usual, with my Xmas story. I'll keep it brief.

I bought my first 914 in the late 70's. It was a red '72 1.7. Loved it! My
buddy had a yellow 2.0, and we used to scream down the twisty backroads of
Iowa. We must have been a sight. Finally, the bank told me they wanted it
back, so I sold it.

Earlier this year, I saw a cute little blue 914 driving downtown Iowa City
with a phone number on it. It was a '72 1.7. Can you say "impulse buying"?
It was mine. Only after I bought it did I look for an internet connection
to this car. Found this list, and then, to my dismay, was told to look
under the car. Oops! I screwed up big time. Major body flex.

Have been taking auto restoration and welding classes at the local
community college since I believe in my heart that all 914's are worth
fixing. These classes are hard, but really a lot of fun. I've always wanted
to know how to do this stuff. I've just blown in 6-9" of insulation into
the ceiling of my garage, and the heater will be installed in a couple
weeks. Damn these Iowa winters<g>.

I just bought a 74 rolling chassis from Brad Mayeur that has had all the
rust repaired. It needs paint (it's in three colors), has no interior,
engine or tranny, nothing, just a sound floor, rear trunk, and chassis. I
am going to build my rotisserie stand and get this 74 painted, then
transfer everything from the 72 over to the 74, then fix the 72 rust. When
the 72 is fixed, I will probably put everything back into it, then maybe do
something fancy with the 74- V8? 3.0? Sky's the limit!

Steve
