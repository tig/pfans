restore a faded top. Is there some sort of dye or something?"
>>>
Now that you've gotten a few of the "shoe polish" responses, here's my
$.02

When shoe polish fades to the leather's natural brown color, many people
will re-apply black leather dye before applying the polish.  If you're
going to experiment with shoe polish, you might as well try leather dye
too.  All easily available from a leather goods store like Tandy, etc.

The last time I did a 914 top, Garold, I cleaned it with de-waxer &
preparatory solvent cleaner, then re-sprayed it with a Ditzler product
called HP-440 Black.  It is a semi-gloss black, formulated for black-out
hood treatments like on the old Dodge & Plymouth muscle cars of the '60s.
 Looks like the original new paint color and sheen, when done.  Lay down
several coats and it lasts a long time.  Many folks have sanded down the
original texture nubs and tried everything from flat black, to high gloss
black to color matching the body color.

I'm sure that we have a purist on here that can tell you the original
factory method, if you're a concourse nut, which I suppose is gel coat,
and can't be duplicated.  Dave, Dirk, Andy?
