Sorry I wasn't clear enough...yes, the A-Arms mounting points at the 
front.  If I remember correctly, the L-shaped bracket had some relief 
machined into one side to clear the A-Arm cap.

I didn't build mine; bought it through a catalog.  However, it would have 
been easy to build, as all the parts except the hitch were 2" flat 
anodized steel, either 3/8 or 1/4 thick.

Another list members mentions having to raise up the suspension on the 
Torsion bars for height/clearance. Now that I think back, I had to do the 
same thing...about 3".

If it were me, I'd buy an existing one at a swap meet somewhere and start 
from there.  It seems unlikely you can build it cheaper than you can buy 
it, even at $1/hr. labor!
