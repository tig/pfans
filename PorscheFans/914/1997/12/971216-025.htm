Greetings, 914-er's!

  In keeping with the request for bio's from the list members, here's
mine;  I will try to keep it short.

  Cars in order as I remember them (some omitted for lack of
memorability); dates are very rough and subject to considerable
error:

1964:  First car... '29 Model A Ford Town Sedan... got it from my
Grandfather who bought it new.

1965:  Sold Model A to a collector and bought '60 Triumph TR-3.

1968:  Sold Triumph and bought '61 MGA Twincam... re-engined with MGB
engine.  Best and most reliable sports car I ever owned, including
914... daily driver and all-around fun.

1970:   Got bitten by the ALFA bug; sold MG and bought '66 Alfa Romeo
Spyder Veloce.   Endless burnt valves and persistant gearbox trouble,
owing to the fact that Alfa had manufactured a batch of synchro rings
to the wrong dimensions!

1972:   Really liked the feel of the newer Alfa's; traded the '66
Spyder in on a '67 GTV.   Best car I ever owned for road feel and
handling impression; two overhauls and two clutches in 10K miles made
me swear off Italian machinery permanently.

1974:  Traded limping GTV for functional Toyota pickup truck; out of
the sports car business for almost 25 years.

1995:  With daughter aproaching driving age, I remembered what fun
that MGA Twincam had been when I was just out of high school, and
started shopping for distinctive car.   I was under the impression
that the 914 used VW parts  (wish I had subscribed to this list
first) and bought a '74 2.0 litre with fairly severe rust problems,
and a known bad clutch.

1996:   After an enormous amount of work, and a budget overun that
would make any defense contractor seem conservative by comparison,
got the 914 drivable and registered.   Still need to buy a mig welder
to fix the trunk floor, and there seems an endless number of other
things that I'd like to do to it to make it really the way I'd like
it, but whenever I get behind the wheel, a good part of that '60's
sports car magic comes back as though it was only yesterday.
   I call the 914 my time machine.... I was bombing around town this
last summer with the top off, the radio tuned to an oldies station
playing a Beach Boys hit from when the car was new, and darned if the
'70's didn't live again!

   As soon as my daughter learns to cope with the 914's vauge shift
pattern, and develops the other necessary skills to pass her driving
test, my time behind the wheel will be severely limited.  But... it's
been loads of fun!

   Currently, to keep body and soul together, and to try to pay off
some of the enormous credit card bills that accumulate when one is
calling GPR, Automotion, or Performance Products every other day,  I
push electrons for CBS, Inc., specifically for the CBS owned and
operated station for the Los Angeles metropolitan area, KCBS-TV.   I
am assigned to the transmitter site on Mt. Wilson, and when I'm not
replacing FET's in our Larcan TV transmitters, or some other project
at work, I try to turn a little of whatever small expertise I have in
the electrical area to giving advice on electrical difficulties with
the 914 to list members.   Sometimes, it even turns out that I have
been of some help, which is extremely gratifying.

   However, any contribution that I make to the list is far
outweighed by the invaluable advice that I have received from it. 
This mailing list is worth far more than that $600 set of factory
books.... there is expertise here that one can get nowhere else, and
it is freely offered by a great bunch of guys who just want to
perpetuate the 914, and the great Porsche tradition.   I have looked
at other Porsche lists, and this one is a large cut above all of the
flames, profanity and other nonsense that I see elsewhere.   I think
that says something special about 914's, and the people who own them.
   I am proud to be a member of the fraternity.

					Merry Christmas to All,
                                                            Jim T.
