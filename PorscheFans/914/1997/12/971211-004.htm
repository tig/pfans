Hi Dirk;

Thanks for the response.. Here are some answers to the issues/thoughts
you raised...

> What lonigtudinal are you talking about? If you have any holes in the big

Nope, none.  Tried the ice pick test and it's *solid* - yes, some
surface rust, but that all. Used the pick from the front wheel well all
the way back to the rear suspension mount - from inside the car and
outside).. Even the jack posts and plates are solid...

Inside the cockpit is clean as well also by the engine firewalls (passed
the ice pick test before I got the car). I did have to clean out an old
mouse nest on the left side of the engine firewall to check, but
everything appears fine - not even surface rust under the paint - inside
the engine compartment or cockpit.

> console.

Again, mine are OK. It's just that metal sheet that runs from the engine
shroud, across the longitudinal and butts into the wheel house. The best
way I could describe it is if you dropped a marble off the battery tray,
it would roll down onto that piece. The rust holes, about 1" each are
back from the firewall about two inches and straddle that longitudinal 

> support. There is a replacement piece that you can buy anyway.

Just spoke to Tweeks - wouldn't you know they are backordered for "22 -
90 days".. Ouch.

Thanks, that's the info I was looking for...


> ...If you have an air supply, there are

Yes, I've got a *large* compressor - thanks for the input. I didn't know
about applying wax, but it's a great idea. 


Also, thanks for the pointers about rear window removal, battery
suggestions, etc.  As you read my responses, please let me know if I'm
missing anything.  Seeing as how I only want to do this ONCE, and
additional thoughts would be great....

Thanks again,
John Dunkle
