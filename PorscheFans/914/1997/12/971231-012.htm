Jack and all list members,
Basically all you do is remove the remains of the rusted floorboard. This is
accomplished by drilling out all the spotwelds for that particular section
of the floor. The new floorboard are avaliable from Auto Atlanta. Front
floorboard, which is actually not a complete front section, is $175. The
rear floor is also $175. These go from each side of the 914 to the other. 
You will need a spot welder or a MIG welding machine to install. Also a good
eye shield, welding gloves and a wire brush for cleaning metal. Wear long
sleeve shirt. Safety is the most important thing you must consider. 
The only info I have seen showing these repairs are some photographs that I
purchased from AA a few years back describing 914 rustoration. These are not
the best, but again, I have not seen any other showing this repair. If you
decide to do the repair, wait until you get the new floor before removing
the old. 
You will have to remove the seats, carpets and back uphostelery as many spot
welds are better accessed from within. This is best for dropping in the new
floor and tack welding in place. Some will have to be done with car raised
to get at them from underneath.
Tack in the new floor, just enough to hold it in its exact position. Once
this is done and NOT before, weld spots about six inches apart. Weld should
be just enough to just bind the metal parts together but not too much as you
don't want to distort by too much heat in any section. A good spot weld will
be about 1/8" in diameter after completed. Try and do this without striking
a new arc before complete. In other words, strike an arc and hold the
welding tip in one position until you see the puddle form. Too long and it
will burn through. The time involved is about 3 or 4 seconds per spot. The
tip will also be held about 1/8" above the metal once arc has started.
Practice this welding on some scrap metal before actually doing anything to
the 914.
PRACTICE--- PRACTICE-----PRACTICE 
Remember this above ALL things. You can read books about how to do things
and they are good guidelines, BUT the only way to do anything is by doing
them. If someone else can do it, you can too if you really want to learn.
Never get in a hurry. This is the factor that kills your ability to continue
if you make mistakes.
Speed will come as you gain the confidence in yourself.

Additional comments may follow this from others. Weight the input and append
to suit your particular needs. What you are doing is important to keep the
914 where it belongs. On the road of the future, with you behind the wheel.

Go for it.
Best wishes for 1998.
