I used to put them on dry, but got really tired of screwing with them so
started using a high-temp sealant that is supposed to be impervious to
gasoline.  Those darned gaskets (talking about the big thick plastic
doohickies) seem to be prone to cracking - maybe due to over-torqueing
the nuts, maybe heat, maybe cheap gaskets - who knows.  Whatever the
cause, the sealant seemed to help a bunch.  Also, use Locktite on the
nuts and/or check them every few months.

I got mine from the Bug-E Warehouse - the local Weber distributor
(that's a joke, but that's another story).  Anyone who sells Weber stuff
should be able to get you one.  Cost about $90 and worth every penny of
it.  Just ask for the X-bar linkage for a VW/Porsche type IV motor.
There are probably other linkages that are as good, but there are some
that are pure junk.  The 'monkey action' linkage has too much slop and
is hard to adjust.  I tried a cross-bar linkage from Dee (Bugpack?) and
it wasn't worth the packaging it was shipped in.
