Yes, the vacuum would be lower at full throttle, and that is the point.  
You may be completely correct about the MPS being "maxed out" when the 
stock throttle body is at full throttle.  However, I would not be 
surprised if it wasn't maxed either.  If the increase in bore size was 
reasonable, it might work.  I would not expect a huge power increase from 
this, but does anyone really know.  Larry Moeller's note that

is support for the benefits of a (slightly) larger bore.  I am also 
concerned about the TPS enrichment being incorrect and thereby possibly 
decreasing acceleration.  Also, the lean condition at full throttle could 
be checked with a gas analyzer.

The reason I first thought of this swap was to deal with a drivability 
problem in the original TB design.  It relies on the butterfly as a 
throttle stop which in my car results in sticking.  This sticking is 
probably a significant cause of TB wear.  I think other D-jet equipped 
cars (Mercedes Benz perhaps?) did have an adjustable throttle stop, which 
would not be prone to this sticking.

I promise I will not toss my old throttle body until I have a better 
solution.
