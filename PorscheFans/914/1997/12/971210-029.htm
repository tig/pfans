Yeah, your'e probably right about that. My battery is in the rear trunk, put
there by the PO (or his mechanic), in a plastic battery box.

Here's what I did, I put caulk on all of the lap joints in the engine
compartment. That's a lot of sealing! Then I painted the caulk. My body guy
had already sprayed wax into the console and other places. 

It's really sick the way they made this car. There's a long channel section
along the rear bulkhead in the engine bay that has several holes in it. Just
for fun, spray some cosmoline in there and see where it dribbles out! it
takes a while, but it comes out right next to the suspension console!
There's a little drip hole on the rear side of the console down low by the
engine tin. So, since this channel is exposed to the weather, guess what
happens to the water that gets in there???? it makes me wonder. really,
really, wonder.

Happy Holidays to everyone on the list!  I'm Rich Johnson from Plano, Texas.
I'll add a short personal history and I'll do my best to keep the rest short
too.
Plano is a northern suburb of Dallas.  Most importanly to a ex-Minnesotan this
area is a place where 914s go topless most of the year.  I live here with my
wife Diane (very tolerant to the 914 fetish) and my two daughters Sara (7),
Beth (5) and our beagle pup Copper.  
At 39 years old and about 50lbs. happier than I use to be in my single days I
can honestly say I never expected the 914 to be as big a part of my life as it
has.  I've been luck enough to have found Porsache's 914 fairly early in my
adult life.  It was the late 70's, my means were limited and my sports car
knowlege was "zip".  After that first ride through the Heights of Little Rock
in a nice one-owner 914-4 I was hooked.  I still have that first 914 and have
tinkered with it continuously.  I really enjoy the simplicity and flexability
of these cars and have become very involved in trying to improve them.  Thanks
to the adaptabilty of this car I now have a very nice example of what I think
the 914 could have been.    
I've owned several other sports cars through the years and my experiences with
them left me with mixed feeleings.  The Datsun Zs were decent but never
stopped or handled like the Porsche.  Chevy's Corvette was just plain bad in
the late 70's and even a recent "short" relationship with a 50th anaversay car
reminded me of what I didn't like about them in the first place.  This years
event in Branson  (Thanks to Andy McFarlin!) exposed me to Porsche's new
Boxster.  Not surprisingly, the 986 is the closest car to 914 that's ever been
produced.  If the lotto hits I'll have one.  Short of that I'll be pushing the
3.0L around for quite some time.  Drive a 986 if you get the chance.  Its a
very nice car!    
I'ld also like to thank some of my 914 friends here.  Getting info., parts,
practical advice is what this list is all about.  Thanks to Wes, Perry, Glenn,
Dave, Allen, Richard and a bunch of other 914ers I've made it through another
year.  Putting Ole Yeller back together this year was a huge project.  With
the resistance the insurance companies provide its almost impossible to
correctly repair these cars without litigation.  Hopefully I'll to be able to
return their help sometime.
I'ld also like to extend and open offer to the list.  If anyone has a chance
to pass through the Dallas visiting or on work within the area let me know.
Schedules and time permitting I'ld like to say hello.          

Merry Christamss Everyone!
