Greetings from a 914 newbie.

I'm tentatively beginning a search for a suitable 914/4 restoration
project (can't afford a /6 anytime soon).  From reading various web
pages and archives I agree the '73 and '74 models appear the most
desirable.  The early ones appear (by majority opinion) to be among
the least desirable, largely due to the tail shift tranny but also due
to a less inviting cockpit (nonretracting seatbelts, weak window
regulators, fixed seat, etc).

My question is:  How easy/difficult is it to retrofit '73+ window
regulators, retracting seatbelts & seats to the '70-'72 models?
I imagine the late style seat tracks would need to be installed,
but is the rest of it a bolt-up swap?  What other interior retrofits
might be desirable from later models?

Probable dumb(er) question:  Does there exist a towbar to fit the
914 so it can be flat towed?  I have one made for Type-I VWs that
I used in getting my last restoration project (Karmann Ghia cabrio)
to/from the body 'n paint shop and it really made life simple.  One
for the 914 would be very helpful as well.  I don't recall the exact
front end setup on a 914 (last serious intent on them was ~10 yrs
ago) but I'm 99%+ certain my current towbar won't help me much...
