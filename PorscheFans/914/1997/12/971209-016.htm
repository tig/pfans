For all of those 914ers who are dealing with at least a little bit of rust (I
think that applies to everyone) I was wondering what is the preferred method of
dealing with surface rust.

I have heard of using something called POR-15, but don't know where to buy it.
 At the local hardware store I have seen a product which I think was called
Endure (made by Duro).  I have also heard of some kind of paint which
supposedly turns rust into iron.

I presume that with any of these coatings you would use something like naval
jelly to prepare the surface and remove as much of the surface rust as
possible.

I'm sure a lot of you have dealt with and tried a lot of different products.
 Is there one that is regarded as being the best?

Thanks!
