Demick,
I was at the Long Beach Hi-performance 
Swap Meet a few Sundays ago and  picked up
some POR 15-rust inhibitor paint.  It comes in 
black, silver, clear and now semi-gloss.  I haven't
used it yet (DAMN EL NINO) but am going to use
it on my floor boards (under seats), around pedal 
cluster and under gas tank area.  I was talking to 
the distributor at the swap and he had a piece of 
rusty metal that had been POR 15'd.  It was as 
smooth as normal paint.  He said that if you use 
600 grit (wet) it, you can paint it any color you want, 
even lacquer-based.  Hope it warms up and stops 
raining, I need a normal L.A. warm winter weekend 
to do this!!  I'll tell you how it turns out.
