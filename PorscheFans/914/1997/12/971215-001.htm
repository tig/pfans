Are you sure you need a rebuild? What condition is the motor in? I'm more
than willing to help you out, but I've never "done" one of these motors, and
I've heard that they are not easy. The cost of parts shocks me out of my
mind. It is a mind blowing experience to price out a 911 rebuild.

I would say it is a must have. You also need a clean place to assemble the
engine and measure the parts.

You have to measure the jugs to determine if they are reusable. I don't know
about a source for just S psitons. I'm pretty sure that they are NLA.

The Weber 40IDA3C is standard, I beleive.

If it was me, and I knew that the motor was worn out, I would study every
book I could get my hands on in addition to browsing the web. There are many
things that need to be checked and measured in these engines. Also,
according to a place in ohio, their opinion is that every 911 motor case is
warped and needs to be machined so that the mounting surfaces for the jugs
are exactly parallel to the crankshaft center line. So, what I'm trying to
say is that rebuilding a 911 motor is not a simple case of remove and
replace the worn components, there are many other factors that come into
play. These engines are the mecca of sophisticated mechanical design. There
are so many parts that have to be "correct" for the motor to have a long
life that it would be a daunting task for an amatuer like myself to rebuild
one. Everything has to be inspected closely for wear and wrapage. 

Also, there are many updates that would be wise to perform while doing a
rebuild. Replace the chain tensioners, for example. I would prefer the
mechanical tensioners over the carrera ones because I don't like have any
more oil lines running around than necessary. Also, the case should be time
serted and all studs and bolts should be replaced with Raceware parts. Also,
this motor may need oil squirters installed (these shoot oil on the
backsides of the pistons to keep them cool). Also, it would be smart to use
all new hardware (nuts, bolts, washers, etc). 

I mean, someone like myself could easily go nuts on one of these motors. For
example, I wouldn't think twice about having all the connecting rods, the
flywheel, and crankshaft cryogenically tempered. I would apply ceramic
coatings to both the combustion chamber, valves and exhaust ports. I would
consider painting the case. Like I said, it's easy to go nuts on something
this sophisticated.
