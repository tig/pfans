What's the problem? There are plenty of tires out there in the fun zone.
Just what exactly is "the size we need". Just about everyone here runs
195s or 205s on the factory fuchs.

No the VW offset won't work with some 914s. All 914s were handbuilt, and
all are slightly diferent. What fits on one car may not mit on another,
or for that matter, the other side of the same car.

I ran 195/60-15 tires under stock fenders on factory fuchs with no
problems, and I ran at just over 3000 rpm on the freeway at interstate
legal speeds. Well, ok, just _a little_ above legal speeds. ;)

So it really depends on how fast you intend to go. The stock speedometer
is calibrated to the stock 165/75-15 tires I belive, and should give you
3000rpm at 70mph.
