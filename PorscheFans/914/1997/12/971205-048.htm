Where do you get these rivet nuts?? I saw some in the Eastwood catalog, but
they are really expensive (the installation tool is anyway). I called my
local NAPA dealer and they weren't really sure what a rivet nut was, though
he did look through the catalog for me. Of course, the local hardware store
doesn't carry them. I can get metric ones from M&MCC, but they are special
order. 

Also, if you happen to be browsing the Eastwood catalog and see the
self-tapping threaded inserts, those are available cheaper at M&MCC. But,
it's probably better to use the threaded inserts that require a tap, because
for an amatuer like me without a drill press, a self tapping threaded insert
would be too easy to muck up. Also, M&MCC has the required metric taps and
drills. I just ordered some M8 hardened steel threaded inserts (EZLOK M), a
drill and a tap to repair one of the exhaust studs. A PO decided to not
remove the stuck nut from the stud and just screw the stud back into the
head. Well, when you do that often enough, the threads in the aluminum head
wear out and the stud gets loose. (sound familiar, JJ?). M&MCC sell metric
helicoils, but the threaded inserts are probably better. The M8 inserts
requires an M12 threaded hole for installation, which means I needed an M12
tap and the proper drill bit size. I'm going to have to get an M6 set too to
repair the set screw in the transmission for the speedo drive. Mine was
helicoiled, but failed.
