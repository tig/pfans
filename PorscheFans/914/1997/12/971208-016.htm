Hello all, My name is Ed Villela. I am 31 and live in nothern New Jersy. I am
a PCA member, NNJR. I have a wonderful wife,who does'nt necessarily care about
914s, and a 17 month old son, who already loves tools and playing in the 914.
Just like dad. I have been reading this list a little over a year now. As a
matter of fact, its the first thing I do every morning. I have a 1973 1.7L. I
have had my car for 13 years now. I  am  currently putting on steel GT flares
with 7&8 Fuchs, 911 front end & 5 lugs rears, sway bars, a fresh 2.0L with
stock FI, yada yada yada .... All of it !!!  I am basically building a 914-4
GT. The car has been apart for 41/2 years now. This was not intended, its just
that life had some suprises in store for me, some good  some bad. But I'm back
on track again now. The car will be back on street and track again by spring
1998. I wish I had this list when I first got into 914's. I've made lots of
mistakes, got lots of BAD and INACCURATE advice, and wasted lots of MONEY. I
have learned so much about our cars from the list, a thank you to you all. I
have also made some really good and trustworthy friends from the list also.
Brad Mayuer and Rich Johnson in particular. I hope to eventually contribute to
the list as my project gets going, right after Christmas. Would like to meet
any local list members to hang out, drink beer, bench race, or work on 914s.
Thank you for the opportunity to introduce myself, Happy Holidays.

Ed Villela
