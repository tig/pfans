You don't need to look very hard. The HR4 is down neasr the bottom of
the non-crappy tires.

Oh don't go the Michelin route if you're looking for a performance tire,
at least not the MXV4s. I've driven them, I don't like 'em. In a
185/65-15? I don't know of many if any performance tires that are made
in that size.

A 205/50-15 is a good bit shorter than what you are currently on, so
maybe that's out. It would most likely be out anyway as the Mahles and
Rivieras I don't believe have the neccessary backspacing to fit a 205
under stock fenders. I'd say that if you're concerned more with
performance than longevity, then a 195/60-15 Yokohama A509 woudl be the
tire for you. About the same rolling diameter as a 185/65-15 and you
will notice a _considerable_ improvement of those HR4s you've been
running on.
