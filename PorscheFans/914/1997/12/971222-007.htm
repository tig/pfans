I think there would be some interest in this kind of "kit".  It occurs to 
me that perhaps the most expensive part of a 5 lug conversion is the 5 
lug wheels, not the other parts.  I want bigger calipers and vented 
rotors but to change all the wheels would be pricey.  I doubt there is a 
real strength need for the five lug wheels, so I would not mind a kit 
that changes the front to a studded 4 lug hub that accepted 911 rotors 
and calipers.  The best thing going right now is the BMW caliper 
conversion.
