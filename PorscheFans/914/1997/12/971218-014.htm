I just rebuilt my wiring harness, so the connection to the head temp sensor
was replaced and soldered.  I've also checked the resistance cold and warm,
and both were within spec.  However, since this will be the first item on my
"double-check" list, I'll do it again.  What was the spec for the head temp
sensor again?  2500 cold, 350 warm?

My heads were just rebuilt by Mark Stephen's High Performance, and they
time-serted the spark plug holes.  My gut tells me they're O.K.  Can you
think of a way to verify this without pulling the heads off?

Thanks again,
