The logitudinals run length-wise from the front wheel well into the rear

suspension mount and are accessible once you take the outer rocker
covers off.  It is not difficult to get to them for inspection.

The original thread to this discussion covers how to attach replacements

without bending the chassis out-of-line.  My suggestion for this is,
take a 2" x 4' square bar stock and place it on the jack stand mounts on

the floorpan, and with the door closed, jack the car up along the bar so

that the chassis is true - the bottom of the door sill and the lockpost
will give fairly general accurate readings as the bends will be visible
as the gap between the bottom of the door/ door sill, the rear of the
door/ lockpost and the front of the door/fender and these seams need to
be straight.

To weld on the new pieces without inducing a bend or warp, tack weld the

new longitudinal supports at 6" to 8" spots, then close those to 3" to
4" tacks. Finally, run a reverse seam weld between the tacks you have
created or continue to tack so that they are about 1" apart.

Just my $.02
