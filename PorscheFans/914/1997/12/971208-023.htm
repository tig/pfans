Hi All & JJ, 
I think JJ should get some kind of award for the guy who has gone thru
the most crap to keep/get a 914'er running.
I have to admitt at one point every time a saw a JJ posting I thought, 
*$*#$@^& NOT AGAIN!! But it must be like a car accident, you just have
to look. I do read them now just to see what up and really feel for the
guy.
Good Luck JJ, I hope '98 is a purrrrfect year, 
 Don
