The first time I adjusted my own valve clearances I had alot of noise. 
Since I was relatively new to the 914 mysteries at that time and I was 
doing alot of business and getting a lot of free advice from George Hussey 
at Auto Atlanta, I asked him what I might be doing wrong, and that I was 
following the Haynes manual. George said that the Haynes manual for the 
valves clearance settings is WRONG.  He said that they both should be .006 
for stock 1.7 and 1.8 engines.  I believe that the .006 and .008 is OK for 
the 2.0, but don't quote me on that.  My car doesn't have a stock CAM (and 
several other things) and the last time they were adjusted they were at 
..004 and .006.  By the way, AA may have high prices, but their advice 
(good so far) is free if you're willing to pay for the call.

Subject: Transmission

On two occasions I've watched a friend put together a 914 transmission,
install it, and adjust the linkage until it shifts well in all gears
standing still.  However, on the first test drive it locks up in fourth
gear and won't come out of 4th.  He said he meticulously followed the
book (Haynes?) and used the automotion alignment tool.  I hope this
doesn't take the entire holiday, so any thoughts or suggestions would be
appreciated?

Subject: Brakes and Valves

Season's greetings p-nuts,

Hey, I'm in need of some coaching from somebody here...
I have two separate problems going on with my '74 2.0ltr

1. Front Brakes
I have a new set of pads in front (from GPR) that I put in, with lots of
"anti-squeal" compound on the backs of them.  All I did here was change 
the
pads and now the car sounds like a frigging volvo with the annoying squeal
that I'm getting.  Squeal sorta goes away as the brakes get warmer...
QUESTIONS:
- the rotors are in good shape, I did NOT bother to turn them ..could this
be the problem?
- suppose I'm using too hard a brake pad? (these are supposed to be
agressive street compound pads)
- My pedal pressure isn't the world's firmest...suppose bleeding the 
system
will help?
- any other things I can check (or do)?

2. Valves
I've been adjusting the valves according to the settings in the manual
(.008  exhaust and .006 intake?)
and I get a small, gurgling backfire between shifts...I'm not convinced 
I'm
doing everything right here.
QUESTIONS:
- Starting with #1 TDC, I've rotated the engine counter-clockwise to get
1,2,3,4 in order...watching the distributor rotor move exactly 90 degrees
to the next piston for TDC...this IS the correct sequence isn't it?
- Intake valves are towards the INSIDE of the head, right?
- is this gurgling backfire symptomatic of too-tight valves or too loose?
- Anything else I could check? I really don't want to yank the engine just
yet, although I do need to put another clutch in it pretty soon...

anyone?

Thanks and Merry Christmas to all
Thom Kuby

Subject: RE: Brakes and Valves

If you bring the car up to about 5000 rpm under load, and then let it 
coast
back down (leaving it in the same gear the whole time), do you hear the
backfiring?  Did you at any time remove your exhaust to do the valve
adjustment or any other work?  If so, I'd suspect a small exhaust leak
between the heat exchangers and the heads.  This can sometimes be verified
by inspecting the tops of the pushrod tubes for exhaust residue.  It's
really critical that the heat exchangers get seated in the heads correctly,
and always use new copper gaskets.  As far as the brakes go, have you 
tried
"seating" them?  I had an Rx7 that squealed a lot when I put on new pads,
but several very aggressive stops from about 50 mph put a stop to that.
Basically, you've got to get the surface of the pad to match the surface 
of
the rotor, and there's only one way to do it... use.

Subject: Re: 4 lug wide wheel question

Ben,

What you need to know is the wheel OFFSET.  Offset is the distance
between
the mounting plane and the center of the wheel.  It's fairly easy to
calculate from measurements on a bare wheel, and not impossible with
a tire mounted.

You want the offset to match, independant of rim width.  (The correct
"backspace"
will change according to rim width.)  Changing the offset will change
the suspension geometry.

Measurements on my car indicate that a 6.5 or 7" width rim will fit with
the stock offset.

Gary.

I can sympathise. When I was getting my first rebuild, I bought a
rebuilt tranny from (company name withheld, but they're a big P-car
parts house). The first one I got from them had a wasted R&P and howled
like crazy. The second had a really bad 4th gear, and within 50 miles
4th gear locked up and would not come out, at all. It was a poorly
alligned shift fork, and it locked up under load and wouldn't free up.
It's actually quite easy to screw up a 901 box from what I've been told.
That's why transmission work is the only thing I won't willingly do on
my own.

I do wish you luck on your work. And I'm sure there are a few hardy
souls here on the list who have tackeld and succeded at transaxle
rebuilds.

The traffic is low today for some reason, so I'll jump in despite my
limited experience.

I strongly suspect the pad compound. And the short answer is you may
have to learn to live with some noise. I tried an early (orange) version
of the carbon pads on my 914 a few years ago and loved them at the
track, but very quickly decided to swap them out for the street. Try all
the tricks first, like champfering the leading edge, cleaning the
caliper surface that the pads slide on and lightly greasing the metal
backing plate where they touch the caliper, etc. but you will probably
have to experiment with other pads until you find the performance/noise
compination that works for you.  Have you tried the Hawk HPS pads? They
were pretty quiet on my C2, but still noiser than stock.
