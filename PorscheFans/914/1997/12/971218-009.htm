You know, one of these day, I'm going to be able to post a message telling
everyone that my car has passed emissions and is running perfect... but
today is not that day.

I don't know whether it's a good thing or not, but I was able to disconnect
my tachometer last night without affecting the way the engine runs at all.
So, if I boil everything down, here's what I've got:

Engine hunts at idle.  Sometimes small (100 RPM fluctuation), sometimes big
(almost dies, then jumps back to 1500).

If revved up under no load and held at constant RPM, engine doesn't sound
very smooth (it kind of "burbles").

The only thing I've got left is to try swapping in a new relay board.  I've
got one on the way here right now, but I'm not optimistic.  So, if I pretend
I haven't tried anything yet, what's the list of major causes of this kind
of behavior?  I'm just going to have to double- and triple-check
everything...

Thanks again,
