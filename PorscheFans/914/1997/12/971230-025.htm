Dion made a very positive statement which shows that the 914 is still
viable, even under dire conditions he described. Hopefully we all will gain
better understanding of these machines and their aura that gives us a common
interest.
Many of us are just pokeys, but it is also fun to drive that way sometimes.

I have received very positive response to my beep beep statement. I am sure
all get my drift to all facets of the 914 list. Many of you know me and are
not surprised by my dedication to what some call the Porsche Volkswagon built.
1998 is only hours away. It can be the year that we satisfy our 914 dreams
and desires, make new friends, renew old friendships and persuade new blood
to buy many disabled 914s' from those who have neglected to keep the spirit
alive by their neglect.

There are many bargains for those who look and more parts are avaliable than
a couple of years back when some of you did not use the Internet.

We owe a big thank you to those who provide the 914 sites for our
interests.Without their efforts and the endless supply of free information,
we can assume some of our babies would be swallowed by the Junkies. Gone
forever.
 
We should always be grateful for suppliers of parts, new & used.

I  am especially fond of Auto Atlanta because of the dedication George has
supplied to 914 owners. Sure, parts cost money but you don't have any idea
of what we would be paying if he had not loved this breed and took that step
to see that there would indeed be parts when you need them. No. This is not
a commercial. Its' just the honest truth.

I left this list when I had to sell my babe for financial reasons. I am back
with a 70 1.7 that was a gift and will love it because that is exactly what
I started with in April, 1970 except for bad front floor and has, don't tell
a soul, a carb.

Beep beep. Here comes a Porsche.
