One of the things I need to do on my 914 is rebuild the front
brakes.  (Actually, I've got a set of 320i calipers machined
and ready to go...)  But first I've got to get the front wheels
off.  Now, mind you, I consider myself a fairly competent mechanic
who's been inside several engines, and removing the front lug
bolts shouldn't be rocket science.  However, it appears that
it may have been several years (three for sure, possibly as many
as six) since the front wheels have been off this car, and they're
just plain stuck.  I've tried the usual things up to
penetrating oil, but stopped short of using a torch or impact
driver (though I did give them a few good raps with a hammer).

Considering I'm planning on replacing the front wheel bearings
anyway (already got 'em, sitting next to the calipers), what's
the risk of getting a little more, er, persuasive in my attempts
to remove the wheels?  I'd hate to break one (or more) lugs, or
otherwise damage the hub or suspension, but those wheels have got
to come off eventually...
