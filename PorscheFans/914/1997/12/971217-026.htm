Dear P-Fans, here is my Xmas intro :

I have been a Porsche freak since I was in the grade school.  When I
finished High school, I promise myself that I have to get a Porsche before
I turn 21 (somehow that misleading believe that Porsche will get you
girls....)
My first Porsche wasn't a 914 but a 79 911 SC, I bought the car with 1/2
cash and 1/2 on my credit card (can you say "STUPID"??) and yes, that
naturally put me in deep debts for years.  I took my 911 auto crossing,
time trailing until everything started to fall apart.  Oil started leaking
here and there; i wanted to upgrade the suspensions; along with too many
upgrades that I wanted to do.  (Read : MORE DEBTS).  
In June of 1993, a friend and I decided to join the first ever POC Night
Enduro race (using his car).  We finished the race and also came in first
in our class *my racing career high point* but after that race, I decided
to go back to college and stopped all kinds of racing.  But I still hang
out with many good Porsche friends and still drives my crippled 911.  On my
birthday in 1994, my friend (I'll call him Ecyor) gave me his 914 as a
birthday present!!! (What a friend??).  Ecyor had bought the car for US$100
(as a project) but soon realize that he was running out of parking space
and gave it to me.  It was a 73 1.7, the car runs and drives ok, it just
smelled really bad inside.  My natural instinct told me to finish the
project so it gone through many modification such as Fiberglass hood,
trunk, front fenders, rear fenders, front bumper, 89 Carrera front
suspension, 911rear brake, Fuel Cell, Recarco SPG (thanks to 789),16X8
w/245 45 16 008R all around....on and on and on.  Of course I had also
upgraded the motor to a 2.0 (buying a used 2.0 and rebuilt it).  By the
time the whole project is complete, I had dug myself another debt hole and
I wonder if Ecyor is really a good friend or if he is a major shareholder
of a credit card company.  

In May 96, there was a race held by one of the local club (at Button
Willow) which I thought would be a good idea to try out my baby (before
running with the POC big dogs).  At the warmup lap, I was so nervous that I
mis shifted coming down the "Magic Mountain" and I blew up the dang motor. 
Yes, I was that nervous AND I was not familiar with the 901 gear box shift
pattern.  So it all went back to the drawing board.
This time, I had another "supposely pretty well known" VW / Porsche shop
located in Redondo Beach rebuild my motor.  And of course, I listened to
the shop owner and went with his 2.4 "SPECIAL" that will promise to give me
a kick in the butt.  Oh boy, did it kick me in the butt!!  Right after I
got the motor back, I took the car out on a cool sunday morning driving it
up Angeles Crest Hwy to see what this baby got.  Guess what, the dang motor
blew even before I got off the 210 freeway!  No, I wasn't going fast and
all I wanted is to see if the motor is running smooth.  
Long story short....I took the motor back to the Shop and the owner said
something was burning really hot and put a hole thru the piston.  Ok,
whatever........he fixed it and now I have developed a 914 phobia, I am so
afraid to drive it.  My car is sitting in the gargage, all race preped
except I don't know if the motor will hold up.  There.....my 914 story.
Ouch.

C.K.
