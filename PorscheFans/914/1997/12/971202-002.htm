Hi,

I was wandering if anyone has experience installing a distributorless   
ignition system on a 914, or is aware of who might sell a kit for doing   
it.  As far as I know, the only tricky part is installing the sensors on   
the crank pulley.

Thanks,

PS. I am now the owner of a '81 BMW 318 Euro edition.  I needed a ride to   
work, and my 914 (w/ no heat) was getting pretty unbearable.  I must say,   
the car is a very nice ride.  The gear box is effortless, The FI is very   
smooth, and the 1.8 pulls very nice.  Of course the suspension needs   
help, and it's starting to rust.
Since then I've been participating on a list of owners of same cars.  It   
seems that this model is one of the forgotten, and undesirable models   
among "bimmers"...kind of like the 914 among Porsches.
