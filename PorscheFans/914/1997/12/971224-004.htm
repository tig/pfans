Ben,

What you need to know is the wheel OFFSET.  Offset is the distance
between
the mounting plane and the center of the wheel.  It's fairly easy to
calculate from measurements on a bare wheel, and not impossible with
a tire mounted.

You want the offset to match, independant of rim width.  (The correct
"backspace"
will change according to rim width.)  Changing the offset will change
the suspension geometry.

Measurements on my car indicate that a 6.5 or 7" width rim will fit with
the stock offset.

Gary.
