Well, after reading some more in that "Rebuilding your VW motor" book, I'm
considering sending the heads out to be reconditioned. I didn't have a
problem with R&R'ing the valve guides, or the simpler stuff like lapping.
The biggest stumbling blocks were grinding the valves and reaming the new
guides. The book recommends grinding the valves everytime, and the new
guides have to be reamed to precisely fit each particular valve stem. If I
skipped grinding, I'd still be left with having to buy a whole bunch of
reamers (8.94mm, 8.95mm, etc), which would be expensive. On second thought,
it might not be that bad, who knows? I might only need maybe 10 reamers.
I'll have to check my M&MCC catalog for available sizes. 

The valve seats do pass an important test, though. With the rockers removed
and the valves held closed by the springs, pour a solvent into the each port
and look for leakage into the combustion chamber (this is with the heads off
the motor, of course). I get no leaks, and I used Brake Cleen. So, this
would probably indicate that I didn't need to grond the valves, which means
that I wouldn't have too much trouble with installed hieght, spring height,
combustion cahmber volume, etc. I could probably get away with lapping only.
The ends of the stems look good, too.
