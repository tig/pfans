	Here's a new subject :-)
	I  was  at three tire stores today and  have returned home
somewhat (very) dissapointed.  My satisfactory Comp T/A HR4 (original)
in P185-65R-15 are no longer made, and  at least  one is  worn   out.
I   wanted   treplace them with something a little higher up the
performance food chain but  I can't see anything  out  there.
	Here is my situation.  I have a set of early  Riviera (big  hole)
knock offs (VW offset) with the above  mentioned HR-4's  on a basically
stock   75 1.8l (wheels are stock width 5.5 inches).  I also have a set
of factory Mahles with old   race rubber (A008's) from a special  edition
which could see the trash (tires, not wheels).  That said I have to ask.

	What are some good modern tires that work  on these cars.
	I want performance, not longevity.  So f I'm down to two,
Dunlop D60A2 in the above size and Michelin MXV4 in above  size.  I
really don't care about  size,  except that the  ones on  there are
already short enough.  I  get 22mph/1000rpm  meaning it allready  screams
on the highway.  My original   intent was to get Comp  T/A Gen 3 in 205-50,
but  I  don't know of anyone doing that or how bad  the  lower gearing
would  be.  This    isn't for racing or just around town.  I do a lot
of highway stuff too.   Please help.
