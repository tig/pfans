Well, lets see....

I am an old-time pca'er ( joined in 84), I am about to be 53, two years
back I remarried a woman who has 3 daughter's and I have 3 sons, so we
are now 6. You can see us all as well as my car in my youngest's wed
site http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~lancef/ Click on the car

It is fun to see what your kids think about you, here is a chance to see
what mine says about me.

	I started out with an 83-944, which changed to an 87-944 after a
wall at Watkins Glenn felt it was stronger than the 944. (pic's on web
site) 

	I felt that if I was going to play on the track I should get a
disposal car so I found a 73-914 (2.0)  #40 which I bought for $1,200. I
now race that car in J-stock, and vintage races on the east-coast. The
local auto-x chairman bet me $10 that I could not do well in Auto-X 4
years back, so I came out and won the class for the next 2 years before
real work started taking away a bunch of my time.

We have 4 p-cars, at this time: 2 -944's (87 & 83)   2 - 914's (#40
73-2.0 & #40c 70-914/6 used in 1971 Daytona 24 hr. now under rebuild)

I have taught driving and racing for 8 - 10 years, most of my students
do better than me.

I work as a free-lance systems consultant, and I have designed and
written all sorts of stuff,  from Point of sale systems for food chains
to Radar systems. I am currently working on a Racing management system
that will (sales concept):

	Track the car - setups for each track
	The completion / with a database of races run at each track with
drivers / cars / conditions/ and times
	The Accommodations at each track area - Motels, food, shops,
parts, freight pickups etc.
	Maps of areas
	Hot lap info, and maybe even video
	
	This will run on not only a PC but on a sharp handheld unit. So
you can take it with you
