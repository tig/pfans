   Hi Wesley!

   I think that I can answer one of your questions:
 
> The injectors are out and I would like to clean them! but as with
Drs, want to
> "do no harm", suggestions???

   It is necessary to operate the injector while cleaning it, as
follows:
I used a current limited bench power supply, so that the
voltage would fold back under the current drain from an injector.  I
set the current to limit at about 1.2 amps (that's about all my
supply will safely dish out) and at that current, the voltage folded
back to about 3 volts.  The coil resistance should be about 2.4 ohms,
so that's about right (give or take meter error in the power supply).
  I would use something similar; either a current limited supply, or
a voltage limited one (2 flashlight batteries in series (provided
they are in good shape) ought to do the trick.)  I prefer the bench
power supply because it's adjustable and metered, so you can see
what's happening, but you may not have such a device handy.  I would
limit the on time to 30 seconds or less, even with the current
limiting.  The devices are designed for short pulses, not continuous
duty, and are fuel-cooled normally, so take care not to fry them.
  When the injector operates, there is an audible click that can be
heard, and the shiny little pin that's in the center of the nozzle
hole can be seen to retract slightly.  If you don't get the click and
the movement, the injector is gummed up inside, probably past hope of
restoration.
  You can clean the injectors by spraying carburettor cleaner down
the inlet hose with power applied (you should get a nice cone-shaped
mist out of the nozzle) BUT
DON'T put the injectors away wet with carb cleaner!   I ruined three
of them that way!
 After cleaning, spray a liberal amount of WD-40 or paint thinner
through them to flush out the carb cleaner.  The coil of wire and the
plastic form that it is wound on are exposed to the fuel path inside
the
injector, and the carb cleaner may dissolve the varnish on the wire
and / or the plastic coil form and deposit the residue on the valve
mechanism, glueing it shut. (This is what happened to me.)   If you
flush out the injectors after cleaning with something mild, you
should be all right. When spraying, if the injector is working well,
you should get a cone-shaped spray pattern.  A good check is to
pressurize them and check for leaks, and also to measure the fuel
passed per minute, but this can only be done on the car or on a test
bench rigged with a fuel pump and a pulser, so I didn't bother, and
you probably won't have to either.  


					Good Luck,
                                                            Jim T.
