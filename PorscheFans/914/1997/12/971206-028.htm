On the 6th day of Christmas, the 914 list gave to me, 500 cheeseheads.... 8^)

I'm glad to see that the intro idea is catching on again this year.

I have a 75 2.0 that I have tried to set up for autocrossing in CSP.  In
addition to a completely stock engine, it currently has 140# rear springs,
stock torsion bars, 7-inch steel wheels, Yoko 205/60-15 008's, 19mm master
cylinder, and hard plastic tranny mounts (don't tell my CSP competitors this
one).

Soon to be added are a 22mm adjustable sway-bar and pre 75 bumpers.

After doing the above over a year-and-a -half period, fellow list member
Dion Dunn gave me enough pushing to participate in my first autocross this
summer.  Now I'm hooked!

As for me, after 10 years in sales, both locally and nationally, I now
manage development and deployment of client-side communications software for
the US offices of a large international freight forwarding company.  In
short, I travel around the country and play with computers -- what a job!

I am domiciled in Cleveland Ohio.  Which means that the 914 stays dormant
for half the year.  Every now and then I go out to the garage and just sit
in it for 15 minutes dreaming (am I weird or what!).

Gotta go,
Jeffrey Dunning
