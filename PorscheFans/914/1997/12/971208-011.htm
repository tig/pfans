> I finally finished refurbishing my wiring harness, and with the
> exception of one small problem, I'd like to think I did a pretty good
> job.  All of the brittle wires have been snipped back and replaced and
> soldered with new wires.  All of the connectors to the injectors and
> trigger points have been replaced and soldered, and even the plastic
> plugs to the injectors are new (thanks again, Dave!).  The entire
> harness has been wrapped in various sizes of black split-tube plastic,
> and now looks somewhat organized.  I put it back on the car on
> Saturday, and after starting it, noticed that my hunting and erratic
> running was still there.  As I inspected things, I discovered that I
> didn't push the tabs on the new connectors for the #4 injector up
> enough, and the shaking of the engine not only ejected the plug from
> the injector, but actually ejected both connectors from the plug.  I
> was left with two unmarked wires that needed to connect to the #4
> injector.  After tinkering for a while, it didn't appear that it
> mattered which one went where, so here's the first question:
> 
> 1.  Does it matter which of the two wires to each injector go where?
> If so, is there a way that I can distinguish between the two with a
> multimeter (I really don't want to unwrap the harness again)?  If so,
> which one goes on the left, and which goes on the right?
> 
> After I reassembled the #4 plug, the engine still wasn't running
> right, so I parked it until Sunday.  The first thing I did on Sunday
> was pull the distributor and plug the trigger points in with the
> distributor detached so I could make sure that all three connectors
> were firmly seated.  Upon reassembly, it looked like this was the
> problem.  The engine now runs much, much better.  The hunting is
> really only apparent if you listen to the engine, since the tachometer
> now only fluctuates within a 100 RPM range (it used to be close to
> 2000 RPM).  The car drives beautifully, except for a slight bucking at
> constant throttle.  If I hold the engine at 2500 RPM while in neutral,
> it's not very steady.  Now, here's where the speculation begins.  I
> tinkered with the wire from the Aux. Air Valve to the coil (remember
> that one?) and now it looks like it's not affecting engine performance
> at all.  As I pondered this, I remembered that when I ran this test
> the first time, my battery had been dead, so I used one from my other
> car.  Since I've charged my dead battery since then, I'm starting to
> think that the erratic idle had something to do with either my battery
> or the charging system.  The final observation along these lines has
> to do with the voltage gauge in the car.  When the engine is cold, it
> sits at 13.5 volts.  As it warms up, it will steadily drop to just a
> hair above 12 volts.  If I use anything that draws power (turn
> signals, head lights, etc.) the voltage will drop to 11 volts.  So,
> here's the second question:
> 
> 2.  Is it possible that a defect in the charging system and/or battery
> could somehow effect the way the engine runs?  In other words, is it
> possible that the system isn't making enough power to generate a good
> spark, and hence the occasional missing?
> 
> As usual, any help with either of these questions would be greatly
> appreciated!
