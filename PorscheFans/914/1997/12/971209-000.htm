The 914-6, like its four cylinder counterpart, used a throttle cable
which attatched to a bell crank on the transmission and then actuated a
rod to the engine which, with a few other connections, operated the
carburetors. The hand throttle on these cars is a rod with, oh, what do
you call them? Bell crank connectors, whatever. The rod attatches to the
accelerator linkage at the pedal assembly, thus pulling the cable. I
always assumed the system was the same as that of the 911, but I don't
know. I didn't even take a good look at my setup, just took it out for a
sec and put it right back in. And that was a while ago. Oh well. Driving
a 912 right now, while I'm waiting for the motivation and means to put
the 914-6 back together.

Marc.
