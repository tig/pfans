 Subject: Transmission
 
 On two occasions I've watched a friend put together a 914 transmission,
 install it, and adjust the linkage until it shifts well in all gears
 standing still.  However, on the first test drive it locks up in fourth
 gear and won't come out of 4th.  He said he meticulously followed the
 book (Haynes?) and used the automotion alignment tool.  I hope this
 doesn't take the entire holiday, so any thoughts or suggestions would be
 appreciated?
  >>

>>>I've been there too.  Turns out the adjustments were fine, however, my
shift fork was worn.  Got another shift fork from a spare tranny and, ta da,
have never suffered the problem again.  The tolerences are so tight with these
things, with a little bit of load and 25+ years of age, stuff happens.  Good
luck

Gary I can't thank you enough for the information about offset. When I put my
question out there I was hoping someone would respond with an answer like
"with flares you need these four lug rims and these tires" What I've
discovered is that there are so many variables I can understand why Auto
Atlanta gets away with charging as much as they do.

Thank you again

I have built five 901 transmissions, two of which have different gear sets in
them.
When you rebuild one you can not just replace the syncro bands, you should
also 
replace the dog teeth and the sliders.  All these parts wear together and
replacing
just one of these parts would not help very much. To replace the dog teeth you
will need a press and a special tool, so you may have to take it to a place
who can do it.  My 2 cents.
