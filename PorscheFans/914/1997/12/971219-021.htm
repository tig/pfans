JJ,

	This is a pretty basic way to adjust the mixture no the fly, but it can
get you into some serious trouble if you do it wrong. And I KNOW you
don't want to have to rebuild your heads _again_. You need some form of
information to feedback on. And engine speed is not the right way to do
it. Use either an O2 sensor or an exhaust gas temperature sensor to set
the right mixture. Otherwise you risk leaning it too far out and burning
the valves, or going to rich and flooding. Talk with Dave Darling, he's
planning to install a "meat-servo" mixture regulator using a dash
mounted potentiometer and one of those K&N O2 sensor displays. Keep in
mind that these K&N gizmos have a time constant, and you need to be at a
steady state while tweaking.
