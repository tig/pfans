I don't think that there is any difference in the primary pipe size
between the 1.7 and the 2.0 heat exchangers. There is no difference on
the SSI pipes, but I'm not sure about the stock heat exchangers. A
smaller primary would tend to lower at least the torque peak, not sure
if it would boost the max value or not. You could certainly replace the
bursch muffler with the super trap, and have it come out the side. I
think that you would still get the benefits of the nice radiused pipes,
and maybe even breathe a little better than the original muffler. If
your Bursch is for the 2.0 heat exchangers, it won't mate to the 1.7 set
up, as the 1.7 has a steep kickup at the rear.
