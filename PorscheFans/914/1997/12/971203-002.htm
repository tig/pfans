First,  I want to say THANK YOU to the list members that responded to my
post several weeks back regarding my search for a 914 (especially Mike and
Frank). The information and cars for sale offered up from list members was
outstanding.

Second (and written with a BIG GRIN) - I drove home last night with a white
'75 1.8 with 61K miles. I found out I'm only the second owner (the car came
with the original paperwork, invoice, Dealer service records, etc.). The guy
sold it to me to make room for his new Boxster (the 90's version of the
914?).  It seems that his (heated) garage would be too crowded with the 996,
914, Boxster and several other sportscars from various marquees...
Obviously, this 914 was well cared for and has little signs of the rust that
has eaten most other 914's from this area back into their former state of
dust (how many battery trays have NO RUST at all and still original paint?)

OK - now let the games begin...  Am I going to concours it? Not on your
life.  I intend to drive it (weather permitting) and use it in AutoX . So
here are a couple of questions for the group (hey, you folks helped me get
into this mess - now help me out of it..):

1- I'll be upgrading to 5-bolt pattern (thanks Rich) - what  are the maximum
tire sizes I can run with the stock fenders (probably run SCCA Solo II -
CSP) on a Fuchs 15 x 7?

2- I live in NH ("Live Free Or Die" state) where there are no smog checks.
Is it relatively easy to de-smog the 1.8? If I do, any downside to
reliability? Any idea to upside power gains?

3 - Now that I'm posting my 1st message to the list as a 914 owner, could
someone tell me what the heck a "Guibo" is? And if I inadvertently find one,
are they endangered (grin :-)? Seems this is the only list that even
recognizes their existence, much less even tries to save them...

Thanks again to all (and yes, for you concours folks, I will be keeping all
the original parts - just in case..)
- John Dunkle
