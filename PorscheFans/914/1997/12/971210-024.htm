Hey Dirk,
That's partly true,  but given a choice between acid and
salt, (or water) which would you prefer?  A thorough flush
of clean water wont remove all the acid, but a flush
with a base solution will neutralize and then perhaps
a followup flush with clean water could remove
the remnants of salt and acid.  Even then, the layers
of sheet metal that a 914 is constructed of will entrap
acids/water/whatever.  In reality, any fluid with corrosive
properties to steel is a very bad thing (including water)
for a 914.

What I should have said (if anything at all . .)
is remove the f*cking battery and diddle with it
outside the car.

I've restored a complete body or two, and after
attempting to neutralize acids from an exploded
battery found that acid residues induce corrosion
at rates faster than salts (Duh!).  In one case, acid residues
were still present after a media blast of a complete
body.  The very best thing would be to use a Gel-Cell
type battery and eliminate the hazard of liquid acid
getting loose in a 914 body.  POR-15, Corroless, black
magic or prayer wont stop battery acid from destroying
the car once exposure has taken place.
After what I have seen, just washing a 914 or exposing
it to rain is a bad thing.
If you should have the misfortune of letting battery acid
spill in a 914 and it gets into the inner wheelwell below the
battery tray. . .
 -get rid of the car, FAST.
