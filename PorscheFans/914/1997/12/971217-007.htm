	5K is not unreasonable.  To do the cam, you have to open up
the case.  Then you get into "Drik Wright's Disease" (previously known
as "Shipwrights Disease"):  Since the case is open, you really *ought*
to replace the bearings, because there's a good amount of time and
labor cost involved in opening the sucker up, and while you're doing
that, you're pretty much committed to a total rebuild, and then...
	Figure $3K-$4K for a "stock" rebuild, or more depending on the
actual work done.  The internal go-fast stuff (cam, P&C) are probably
only a couple of hundred more than the "normal" stuff.  Headers can
run up a lot of money in a big hurry, plus you lose your heat.  Then
there will probably be some tweaking necessary to get the FI to feed
the more powerful motor.
	So I'd say it's not that bad, depending on what will actually
be done.
	You can probably find a reasonable 2.0 engine and tranny for
about that much.  The problem is that the motor will be in an unknown
condition.  Unless you get reciepts for all work done on it, and you
can tell that the particular motor is the one the receipts are for, and
you know that the person who did the work does *good* work.  So you
need to realize that you could be spending that $3500 for a rebuild on
the 2.0 motor again soon.
	Ditto a Six, but even more so.  If you go with a very mild six,
you may not absolutely *need* to upgrade everything else on the car,
but it's still a good idea--especially the BRAKES.  Also, it's hard to
find any Six conversion that *only* cost $5K to do in a reasonable
fashion.  ("Sure it's got an oil tank!  See that beer can?")

	Personally, I'd try to find a 2.0 drivetrain--the less-nasty
shifting should put a smile on your face.  (But remember, you need all
the motor mounting hardware and ALL OF the shift linkage except maybe
the gearshift knob!)
