5k is how much a 'built' SCCA competition (IT or Street prepared) motor
would be from the top builders, with them doing all the work. I'm
talking custom pistons, blueprinted, cc'd, and balanced to whithin an
inch of it's life. Headers are not part of an engine build, and are a
trivial cost compared to a competition build. For a 1.7L motor? $5k is
insane. If you're going to invest that much money into a engine, then
you need to be sure of what you want that engine for. Just for cruising
around, and having fun on the street? I'd get the motor from someone
else or just buy a fully built stock 2.0L longblock from someone like
Otto's or AA or ACC, and swap it in. If you want to build for actual
competition, then read the rules carefully before doing the build. If
you want a mean little screamer that plasters a grin on your face and
you don't give a darn about competition rules or your bank account, then
GO FOR IT! But look into getting that done elsewhere as $5k for ho-po
1.7 is just too much.

Yes it would. Especially if you're currently using a tail shifter
tranny.

Anywhere from $10k to $30k depending on how overboard you want to get.

I've stopped counting how much money has gone into my 914 over the
years. And to tell the truth, I really don't want to know.
