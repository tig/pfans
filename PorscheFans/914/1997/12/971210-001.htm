As part of my restoration project for my 74 914, I acquired 3 parts cars: a
'70, '71 and '75. I used a few of the parts off of them, but I got sent to
Germany by the Air Force and now these cars are in California taking up
space.  I would like to find a good home for them (i.e. I would rather an
enthusiast gets them than a wrecking yard.)

Cars have good glass, panels, suspension, seats;  Two transmissions (tail
shifters); various motor parts (enough for 2 engines, a 1.7l and the 1.8l
that was in my '74);  1.8 and 1.7l FI parts.  The 75 was hit hard in the
left quarter panel and one of the earlies was primered up with a cheap
bondo-formed fin on the deck. The other early has some battery rust, but
other than that is in fairly decent shape.

The previous owner of the earlies had completed a 5-lug conversion to a set
of Fuchs alloys (in restorable shape).  That is one of the big reasons I
bought the cars, but I simply don't have the time to make the switch.  The
75 has a set of Riviera wheels, one scratched up a bit in the aftermath of
getting in the accident.

Cars are in Lancaster, CA (in the Mojave Desert north of Los Angeles). If
you would like to take a look at them, drop me an e-mail and I will give you
the complete location.

My price: Best offer, you haul all three cars away.  I am not super
interested in selling just one car at a time (I need to unload the whole
thing), but if no other offers come, I might split up the family.

-Tim
