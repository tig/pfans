Thanks for the response concerning aluminum T. arms.  What we now have is
an arm that allows camber adjustment at the wheel with toe adjustment in
the conventionl 914 manner.  Because of the complexity brought about by the
camber adjustment, these arms are "pricie" (in the $900/set range).  We are
developing a more conventional 914 T. arm that retains 914 adjustment
methods but with 1 degree of negative camber built-in.  These will be in
the $600/set range.  The advantage is strength.  Since we are using thicker
wall tubing (similar to that used in 911 arms) than steel arms found in
factory arms, regidity is enhanced considerably which translates to less
flex and better longivity.  Another advantage is the small 914 wheel
bearing is replaced with a larger 911SC bearing.  We will do turbo on
request.  Weight is also reduced compared to a boxed 914 T. arm.     AND
THE LOOK......
As a companion to the rear suspension upgrades, we offer a chromoly front A
arm replacement.  These are stronger than factory and weigh 4 pounds less
each.  We use nylatron bushings on both ends.  These arms can be fabricated
longer to produce more negative camber in applications where fender
clearance is available.  This kit sells for $330/pair.  If you have any
questions or comments on pricing or specs, feel free to e-mail me at
gary@gpchassis.com.
