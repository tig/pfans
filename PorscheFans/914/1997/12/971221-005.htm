Hi Rich:

The five-lug conversion seems like something Porsche should have done
themselves from the beginning.  My opinion is that the 911 parts swap is the
best solution since 911 disks and calipers are stronger than stock 914.
There are too many compromises with drilling or using adaptors -- and the
only thing you are upgrading is the wheels.

There are 2 things stopping me from making the "proper" converion:
(1) price;
(2) It would move me out of CSP.  (yea, yea Dion.  I know you'll write back
"Welcome to AP!")

Rgds,
Jeffrey Dunning
