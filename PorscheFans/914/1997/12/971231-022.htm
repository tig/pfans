Hi Sam!

You asked:

  I got asked this question once before, and did a little write-up on
it based on my own humbling experiences... here it is:

   Now, if you exert sufficient force on a feeler gauge, for 
anything but big narly racing engines you can actually open
the valve with the gauge, as you have considerable 
mechanical advantage owing to the curved shape of the
end of the rockers. A correctly adjusted valve will put a slight 
amount of drag on the feeler gauge as it is moved back and forth. 
If the gauge slips in with no resistance at all, the valve is too
loose. 
  If you have to strain, and the feeler gauge feels like it wants to
sproing into an inchworm shape instead of going in, the
 valve is too tight.  There should be just a little bit of drag on 
the gauge; enough so that you can detect a friction effect, 
even with oil present.

 Once you have this feel in mind, stick in the appropriate 
gauge and measure the clearance... as in fortran, you have 
three choices: <  > or =. 
  Once you have determined which way you need to go, 
loosen the lock nut, turn the screw a bit in the correct 
direction, and re-tighten the lock nut.   Note that when
you tighten the locknut, the adjusting screw sets back 
into the rocker arm, commonly by as much as .001", so 
allow for this when tightening, and let the adjusting screw
turn SLIGHTLY clockwise with the lock-nut.  Repeat the 
adjustment as necessary until the clearance is correct;  
i.e. slight drag on the feeler gauge with  ALL TOOLS OFF 
THE VALVE TRAIN!  There should never be any tool on the 
rocker assembly, either screwdriver or wrench, while actually 
measuring the clearance.  You will introduce side loads or 
other moments that will prevent an accurate measurement.


   That's it... I hope that it helps.
