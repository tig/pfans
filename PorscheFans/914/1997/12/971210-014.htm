Ho Ho, (not so oww!  kyle's sternum sez today)

I see some of you folks are having trouble with batteries
since it is that time of year. . .

A tip on keeping the 914 battery in top shape
<yeah, even them 'sealed' new and old ones>

Many 914's still use a mechanical voltage regulator
that may tend to boil off some of the battery's cell
fluids.  The newer solid state ones can do this too.
When the fluid is depleted, the cell feigns death,
but may be salvageable.  If I may suggest, first try
adding *distilled water* or sulphuric acid to a cell
that is low.  Then try a re-charge.

Almost all batteries still have access ports to the
top of the cells for adding fluid to the cells.  -Its just
hidden under those cute labels on top, or the caps
are one-pieced into a long strip which seems to
be seamless.  If you are desparate enough, you
should be able to pry off the cap(s) and access the
cells to check levels.  If you can see the plates above
the fluid, the cell needs topped off.  The level should be
around 1/2 inch above the cells.  Dont overfill.

It is *tantamount* that each cell has sufficient fluid
to maintain a charge and to dispense that charge
into the starter on those cold mornings.

At freezing temps, a lead-acid battery has less than
half current source capacity as the same battery at 23'C.

 -and now a word about neutralizing the
'fluid of death to all 914's' . . .!!
If you should spill or overflow the battery, please
dont let it eat the car, <* it will *>, flush the
area with clean water, then take a gallon milk
jug and fill it with warm water and add a half box
of baking soda (sodium bicarbinate) and dissolve
that into the jug's water.  flush the battery box
and engine compartment with this solution.
That hissing sound you hear, is the acid being
neutralized and your car thanking you.
