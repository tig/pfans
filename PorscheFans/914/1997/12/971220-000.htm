That's more or less what I did with mine. It worked pretty well.

You'd need to "calibrate" the

In my experience it didn't work out that way. First how do you calibrate
CO at speed under load? After I realized this, I installed the Haltech
O2 sensor and meter (which is real-time, by the way), and enjoyed
driving while watching the Christmas light display. What I found on my
car was that a given setting varies quite a lot due to temperature
variables. I agree with Josh that an O2 sensor is the best way for
tweakers.

BTW, you can calibrate the O2 sensor to CO readings at idle for peace of
mind before inspections.  I routed the Haltech cable through the tunnel
and up into the console box to the meter which I taped to the underside
of the ash tray (never got around to the velcro) It fits perfect.
