Josh & other list members,
My point is that most of those who never really see the track are swallowing
all this mod crap as essential for their 914 to be road worthy.
 
All the jacking about mods is not necessary to get the 914 on the track and
enjoy this fun machine. Not winning is no big let down. Most of the fun is
enjoying being around others who have similiar interest in sport cars. New
friends.  

Prime example is Dave Darling. He is really enjoying the 914, although he
has had many pitfalls. Dave has the spirit of a winner each time he sits
behind the wheel in spite of some major mechanical problems since he went
914 a few years back. Motors, wrecks and other numerous problems. As well as
I can remember, Dave is still basically stock and has fun at the track.
Don't know if he has ever won there but to most of us on PorscheFans list,
Tims list and the former Stan Hanks list,  Dave is always a winner.

Like all usually state when commenting, the "beep beep" is just my own opinion.
