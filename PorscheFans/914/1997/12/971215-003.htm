Hmm, starting to sound familiar...

Jim, take a moment to check that your head temp sensor is not
dissconnected. That _could_ be a likely cause. What happens is that the
HT sensor if disconnected will effectively have an infinite resistance,
adn that will be interpreted by the brain as a very cold engine. The
brain will then richen the mixture thinking it's a cold engine. With
that rich of a mixture, it'll flood. However, it sounds to me like you
can run the car normally and it's simply hot starts that are difficult
for you to do. If this is the case, either an injector is leaking badly
(maybe), or the cold start isn't shutting off (more likely). 

When I had an open circuit on the HT sensor, it would stall once it got
warm. The fact that you only have a problem when you drive it, says that
it's a temperature problem. So check your HT sensor connection first, it
could also be the thermo-time switch.
