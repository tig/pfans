Kyle,

Thanks for the advice-  I've received about 10 replies to my two posts 
and have a much better understanding of the Type-4 motor (and its 
limitations) than before.  I can always use advice on parts sources, 
tech tips etc. and often 'sneak-a-peak' at 914 websites wondering if 
912E's may be mentioned.

A couple of things on driving:  You 914 guys do racing and rallying and 
generally get pretty speedy at times, I imagine...my opinion on public 
road speeds- 

Faster does not mean safer!!  It's weird-  the ambulance services are 
not brilliant, hospitals are not as commonplace, there's no helo-lift 
for seriously injured people and the law says that 135 KPH (83 MPH) is 
the speed limit in Italy on the Autostrada....

BUT...the culture here is one of Ferrari, Maserati, Lamborghini, Alfa 
Romeo!! And fast is the way people insist on driving.  There's a macho 
thing going on too-  with Italians if you're in a fast car (say a 
Porsche) slower cars will pull over for you out of respect for the car-  
whose owner must be important and need to go quickly!!  I'm not kidding-  
it's a different approach to driving and cars altogether.  (Perhaps it's 
because historically Italians have lived in a fuedal society?  I 
dunno...)  Any way, it's definitely NOT safer.  Especially in foul 
weather- or on ice (rare in S. Italy.)

I remember a story I read somewhere about an Italian engineer and road 
test driver being asked what limit there was on the top speed of an 
exotic Maserati or perhaps it was a Ferrari-  "The driver's courage is 
the only limit" was the answer-  Pure Italiano Bravura!!   And believe 
me, a lot of Italians live this ethos which is kind of dangerous in a 
way, but very exciting too.

Is that good?  Well, you can drive at reasonably quick speeds-  and most 
people are genuinely aware of the need to defer to fast cars, but the 
roads can be poorly made up, and there are large stretches of A and 
B-class 'strada' throughout the country that feature trees and stone 
walls as the only barriers between you and a real problem!! 

For truly untrammeled and virtually empty roads with  liberal speed 
limit enforcement in Europe (really more lack of presence than a wish to 
encourage high speed travel) you have to travel to Poland, Slovakia, 
Romania, Ukraine and places East.  Problem there is-  if you have a 
heavy prang you probably are not coming home!!

I love driving in Italy-  the Italians love sports cars, rallying, 
racing and have great football teams (beautiful women too, but they come 
after cars, and football!!)!!   They would be surprised if you had a 
sports car if you DIDN'T drive it as it was intended:  sportily!!  But 
you must be really concentrating here- no slacking unless truly dawdling 
along...and I think that paradoxically that may actually mean fewer 
'lazy' but fatal accidents.  (Anectdotal observation.)

I asked a friend of mine why it was so crazy in Italy sometimes- almost 
a sense of anarchy that I have grown to enjoy and he replied, "Because 
here we love life and living, we hate taxes and government, and we have 
a healthy disregard for the law!"   

ALL MY OPINIONS-  others may disagree!!

Have a great Christmas-  e-mail anytime.

R/Dave Lovato

'76 912E  #9126000496 (Need some good condition tan vinyl hi-back seats, 
if they're the right price.  Also a 5-speed black gearknob!!)

P.S.  I wonder if people run Porsches just a little bit 
faster-longer-harder in Mexico?!!!!


From Kyle:   ...but I gotta say, the speeds y'all drive over there is 
wild. . .I live in kansas where the land is really flat and roads are 
mostly strait.  Folks in these parts can barely keep from smashing into 
each other at speeds half what you describe....

Good Luck,
