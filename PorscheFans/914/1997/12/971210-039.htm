I did a 5 lug conversion a couple of year back for my 914 race car.  Bought
a complete 911 front end (shocks, brakes, rotors, torsion bars, calipers
and EVERYthing) for $350.00.  I assume if you are in Southern California,
you can find the same deal easily; oh the 911 front is off of an SC.  Just
pop in the front and you have a 5 lug 911 front suspension.  
Rear - bought a pair of early 911 caliper ($200?) and made my own adapter. 
Took the hub to FAT Performance to redrill it into 5 lugs, then pop in (I
forgot which yr) vented rotors and put the calipers on them.  The car stops
on a dime.  But of course, it a race car and I didn't care about the
parking brakes.  I also have Beck body kits, so I can use as wide a
rim/tires as I like.  you can see the car at :

I just picked up a 1970 914 1.7 that has been sitting for 12+ years in
storage.
The car seems to have been owned by a person that did not tamper with it to
much every thing appears to be unchanged from 1970. The problem I have found
to this point are :
The fuel pump runs and will not shut off( even if I take all relays and fuses
out!)
The car will start with and with out the Head temp sender hooked up( runs best
if it is un hooked and not ground out)
and when I tried to cut it off it would not shut down. (I put good used brain
and checked the wires on the relay tray on left side and everything seems to
mach.)
This is strange one who out there is the true 914 KNOW-IT-ALL

Thanks for the  help,
Doug Franks

My new 70 914 1.7 had been sitting for 12+ years when I found it 2 wk. ago.
The owner now in 914 heaven did not seem to do much to it "it's still all
there as it was in 1970" 
The problems are the following:
1) The fuel pump will turn on with the key but will not stop until I turn the
key off. I It will stay on even if I pull all relays and fuses from the relay
tray if the key is on. I looked to see if it was hot wired but like I said it
looks all as it was in 1970
2)The car will start if the head temp sensor is hooked up or not but it will
run better if it is unhooked and not grounded out.
3) When I go to turn the car off guess what it will not turn off I think this
may only happen when the temp sensor is unhooked.
4) I have put a good used brain in and checked the 12 pole connector on the
relay tray and there has been no change.
What do I do next?
Thanks,
Doug Franks
