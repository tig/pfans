Probably not. The metering of fuel on a FI 914 is restricted and is very
dependant on precise amounts of fuel and air to operate properly. Look at
one that is running rich. Just wasting fuel and possibly creating internal
problems. 
There is a possible answer to those wanting more fuel in the intake.  Run
your fuel thru a refrigerated tube just prior to entering the throttle
valve. It will be compressed then expand more fuel into the intake. Unless
the internal makeup of your engine has been tweaked for performance, you
will probably regret any alterations to the Porsche engineered FI system
other than keeping it in good repair.
