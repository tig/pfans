   Yes, as far as I know with any engine (including V8's) you can use the
standard tranny mounts with the 901. The engine bar is usually what gets in
the way of the shift linkage.
   I have the Patrick Motorsport's engine mount bar and was able to use all of
the stock linkage components. The headers hit the shift bar, so it had be
"turned" 45 degrees down. If you're familar with the shift linkage
construction, there are two screws at each end that keep it from being
rotated. At the transmission end I just drilled another hole for the screw to
go into at 45 degrees from the original hole, so that the bar is held lower. I
can't notice any change from the original linkage configuration.
   I suppose it would be possible to construct a straight bar, and imagine
there are a million other ways (well, probably not that many) people have done
it too!
