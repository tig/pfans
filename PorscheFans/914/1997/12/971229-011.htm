Who tightened them last? If it was "Joe Gorilla" at a shop, then they may
be very tight indeed. But, the spec for those bolts is over 100lbft, with
antisieze applied. I would certainly apply long breaker bar, possibly with
extension. Otherwise, you can drive the car to a shop and ask them to break
them free for you. I had to do that before I got a nice 1/2" drive breaker
bar from sears, that "X" lug nut tool most people use is useless at these
torques. If your "hefty" like some of us, you can apply a lot of torque to
a fastener just with body weight.
