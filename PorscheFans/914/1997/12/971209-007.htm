>>WAXING YOUR CAR
>>
>>One of the keys to applying carnauba waxes is to apply it sparingly.
>> Assuming that the finish has just been washed and dried and is free of
>>grit
>>and does not need glazing,  then apply the wax with a small piece of
>>100%
>>cotton terry cloth or a terry cloth covered sponge applicator pad.  An
>>even
>>better method of application is to use your fingers.  Hold your fingers
>>together to form an "applicator".  Rub the wax thoroughly into the
>>surface.
>> Your fingers will give you the tactile feedback to let you know when
>>the wax
>>has been worked into the surface.  This is NOT a situation where a
>>little is
>>good, so a lot must be better.  Your paint will only accept X amount of
>>wax.
>> If you apply 100 times X then you will have to remove 99X in the form
>>of drie
>>d powder.  It will make waxing more difficult, require more buffing and
>>create clouds of white dust.  
>>
>>Make sure the paint surface is cool.  Rule of thumb, if you can hold
>>your
>>hand comfortably on the paint, then it is cool enough to wax.  Work in
>>the
>>shade, preferably in a garage.  To apply the wax, choose an area about
>>12" x
>>12".  Open your can of wax, get a small amount on your fingers (or
>>cloth/pad)
>>and recover the can (this keeps dirt out of the can).  Apply to the
>>paint
>>surface, rubbing in a linear motion.  Work into the paint in a
>>front-to-back,
>>back-to-front motion (the way the air flows over the car).  Don't go
>>around
>>in circles the way dear old dad taught you.  If you are using a pad and
>>airborne grit gets under the pad, you have made sandpaper. If you are
>>working
>>in a circle, you have made a 360 degree scratch (or swirl mark).  Since
>>a
>>scratch or swirl mark is most visible from a 90 degree viewing angle, a
>>circular scratch is visible anywhere.  If you work in a linear motion,
>>and scr
>>atch the surface, the line scratch is only visible from a small viewing
>>angle.  Using only your fingers to apply wax will give you the tactile
>>feedback to know when surface grit is about to scratch your paint.  
>>
>>Work the small amount of wax into the surface until all that remains is
>>slight haze.  Use of your fingers will also tell you when the wax has
>>been
>>thoroughly worked into the paint and will help prevent you from using
>>too
>>much wax.  Most waxes work best when this slight haze is allowed to dry.
>> There are some waxes that require you to buff immediately after
>>applying.
>> Zymol is a classic example of this type of wax.  If you allow Zymol to
>>dry
>>before buffing, you will need a belt sander to remove it.   Read the
>>directions on the can to determine the proper method.  Buff out the
>>slight
>>haze with a soft 100% cotton towel.  Buff this small section, shake out
>>the
>>towel to remove any grit and rebuff with a new section of towel.  Keep
>>using
>>new sections of towel and change towels frequently.   I use my wife's
>>old
>>flannel sheets.  They are super soft and produce a brilliant shine.
>>Move
>>onto another 12" x 12" section of the car.  Repeat the application and
>>buffing procedures.  When the car had been completed, return to the
>>first
>>section completed and rebuff with another clean towel, continue to
>>rebuff the entire car.  The wax has had time to harden off and this
>>extra buffing will bring out a deep shine.  If there are areas that are
>>hazy or cloudy, and you are using a carnuaba based wax,
>>the wax has become hydroscopic and has absorbed a little water.  Mist
>>the
>>cloudy areas with a small amount of water (a plant mister works well)
>>and
>>rebuff.  This should remove the clouding. 
>>
>>If you are using a polymer based wax on a German paint and have hazy or
>>clouding of the wax, about the only thing that will work is to strip the
>>polymer wax and rewax with a carnauba based wax.  German paints hate
>>polymer based waxes.  I have spoken to paint chemists, the Glazurit
>>people, Porsche, BMW and M/B people and to date have not gotten a viable
>>reason for this.  I have gotten a lot of mumbling and shuffling of feet,
>>but no hard and fast
>>answers.  The Amercian and Japanese paints LOVE polymer waxes.  The
>>German paints just don't react well with most of these products.
>>
>>
>>
>>If anyone has any further questions on types of waxes, glazes, polishes
>>or
>>application, please feel free to contact me.
