Yup, thanks for your consideration. Since I have so many other things to do
before I even get to this stage (like put the motor and transmission back
together!), that this little hand throttle thing is definitely on the back
burner. The 914 is going to be a summer car anyway, so I may not even have
rig something up. (the 2002 is the winter car)

That sounds like pretty good relability to me!

Did you use any kind of sealant on the gaskets? This hasn't been a problem
on the 2002, but the 914 is an entirely different animal.

 I typically check the

Where did you get the linkage? Pierce Manifolds?
