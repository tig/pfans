I've enjoyed reading the other replies to this and learning more about the
names I see.  My turn. I'm Jeff Lorentzen
I've lived in Pasadena, CA for a little over 4 years now.  I grew up in
Salinas, CA (near the Monterey/Carmel area for those who don't know the
area).  Turned 40 a few months ago.  Single - still looking ;-), spending
too much time with the cars.
Went to college at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, CA studying electronics.
That's
where my air-cooled interests really picked up.  I always liked beetles and
really liked the Thing.  I bought my 74 Thing (originally Avocado but PO
painted red) in late 81.  Graduated in 82 and moved back to Salinas.  Got a
job in San Jose and since I had a great and cheap living arrangement stayed
in Salinas.  The Thing was my daily driver.  Got a copy of the John Muir
Idiot's guide and started learning the basics.  Since it was a daily driver
I had to get things fixed quick so except for minor things I took it to a
good VW mechanic I'd found in Salinas.  With the long commute I was doing
the oil change and valve adj/check every 4 weeks.
By late 86 the Thing had 150K and the oil light flickered at idle
indicating
worn main bearing.  I bought a $350 Peugeot 304 from a coworker and ran
that
daily till it died and I sold it for $150. I ended up getting a low mileage
85 Toyota pickup in mid 87 for daily driving and started thinking about the
Thing.  I decided I wanted to rebuild the engine myself.  I spend months
reading various books and catalogs.  I'd gotten the Gene Berg catalog and
my
plan for a stock 'rebuild' gradually evolved into a 1776cc with dual carbs,
almost all new parts from Berg.  Got the parts in early 88 and finished it
by June.  Drove it as a fun car until Monterey County went to bi-annual
smog
inspections and the Thing came due.  Parked it in Aunt's garage (where I'd
done the re-build) and other interests came up.
I'd been working at several places by now, mostly involved with floppy
disks, first a small manufacturer, a hardware salvager, then a duplication
service.  I maintained all the hardware, computers, etc.  Unfortunately I
keep trying the small company approach and the last job kept going through
crash and burn cycles. The big guys from the main Omaha, NE. office would
come out and promise things would be different/better, I'd stay, and for
awhile it would till the next crash. The rise of CD's was evident but the
management wouldn't make the jump into CD duplication.  I finally burned
out
on the whole thing then in 93 a friend in LA told me about the new job he
had at a small startup software company, Knowledge Adventure. I was tired
of
the hardware side and always more interested in software so I checked them
out at a trade show then applied, was hired and moved down here in Aug 93
to
work in technical support and quality assurance. Ended up doing mainly QA
work, specialized in sound cards.  About 18 months ago I moved from QA over
to development in our International dept.  We take our domestically
released
programs and take them apart, produce translation kits, and send to
partners
in various countries.  They translate them and return the content and we
rebuild the programs, make necessary code changes, etc.  Interesting job
since I get to do a little bit of everything, programming, art, sound, etc.
In 94 I got interested in the Thing project again, towed it down to
Pasadena
and started working on it.  Did the switch parts back to stock, smog etc
and
eventually got it smogged.  The top was mangled and I have to park it
outside behind the house I share with a roommate, so in late 95 I towed it
back to Salinas to store over the winter.  When I got back I heard at work
that someone who was leaving to move back east had a 914 to sell for $800.
I'd always liked the 914 so I figured it wouldn't hurt to look.  I did some
quick net research first to learn all I could before looking and a good
thing.  Especially the parts about rust damage and where to look.  When I
went it was a black 73 with a 1.7L FI engine.  It ran and the guy had just
put a new fuel pump on.  But the passenger door was wedged shut and the
drivers was sticky. (It was a project car the guy had bought from someone
else [for $400 I later learned] who also had it as a project)  When we both
got in it to take a test drive I couldn't close the drivers door at all.  I
then crawled under and saw all the rust.  Told the guy I wasn't interested,
too big a project, etc.  I had been toying with the idea of a type 4 to
type
1 conversion to build another engine for the Thing so I told him if nothing
else I'd give him maybe $200 for the engine.  Left, then the next week at
work the guy told me he had to move that week and I could have the whole
car
for $200 so he could get rid of it.  I took it.  When I tried to drive it
the 7 miles to my place I got half way then the battery died.  Did a quick
charge then got the car home.

Discovered this list, had been on VW lists for awhile, and started lurking
while I learned.
Had it sitting in the back for awhile, sat in it and realized that I did
fit
in it ok (I'm 6'4") and that even that little drive home was fun.  Started
thinking about restoring it.  After a lot of research I realized this car
was gone, killed by rust.  I started stripping it down for parts and
storing
them, figuring I'd look for a 73 2.0L.  Based on the oil pan heater and the
$4 in Canadian change I found, this car was killed by time in a cold
climate and
road salt.  Once I stripped it all down I learned I'd made the right
choice,
that passenger door wedged shut was about all that was holding the car from
bowing in the middle.  One of the tranny mounting horns was also broken
off.  Got
rid of the shell in July 96.  Stored a lot of the parts in boxes in my
aunts
garage, I've got a very understanding aunt ;-)
Finally came across my current 914 in Jan 97.  Guy was moving up to Oregon
and had to sell the car.  The car needed work just looking at it, but the
body was straight and the 2.0 engine had just been rebuilt the guy said, it
was clean enough that I believed him. Had the center console and front and
rear factory sway bars.  It had been converted to dual Weber
44 carbs so I knew smog would be an issue.  The guy said it had big bore
cylinders and a larger cam.  His PO had painted it fuschia but the original
color was Alaska Blue.  Had original undercoating that looked in good
shape,
no real obvious rust other than the battery area.  911 Fuch's on wheel
adapters.  I got it for $2000 knowing I'd have work to do but I like
working
on cars so no problem.  I should have checked more since I later found
other
minor problems but still a good deal overall.  Registration had been paid
in Dec.
so I have till this month to deal with smog, if I have to. My plan is for a
fun
weekend driver.

Once I got it I changed the oil and tranny lube. Did a valve adjustment. It
didn't' idle well but was strong at higher rpm.  I checked the timing and
it
was set at about 30deg BTDC at idle  (009 dist.)  I checked TDC and the
dist
position to make sure then readjusted the timing and tweaked the carbs and
it then idled much better.  This was the start of my wondering about the
quality of the rebuild.  The PO had said it was done by a friend of his who
did race engines.
I wanted to get rid of the wheel adapters and had met Don Haney from the
list.
He found a setup for me at a swap meet of a 5lug conversion. Rear 5 lug
hubs and
converted/studded front rotors.  Also found out about George Wright doing
machine
work from Don.  I took it to George and had him change out the rear wheel
bearings and swap the rear hubs to the 5 lugs.  Eventually got the 5 lug
front rotors swapped on, got 18mm 911 spacers from Troutman and George
machined the center hole larger to fit the 914 rotor center.
I was looking to go back to FI and got in contact with Ralph Ricks on the
list.  Arranged to buy a 2.0L FI system and he would help install it.  Got
that done in July.  Ralph has a great setup, a dist. tester and the D-Jet
tester made it easy to assemble a working FI system from the parts he had.
Discovered the return into the tank was plugged while getting the FI back
on
but got it cleared out.
The rear springs had some clunky chunks of metal jammed in them. Learned
they were spring expanders.  Swapped them out for the rear KYB shocks and
better springs I had from the parts car.
The car had various electric glitches I'd discovered.  No horn. only the
left turn signal worked. The buzzer went off whenever the key was off (the
PO had 'fixed' by taking out the fuse, which also killed the interior
lights).  I started checking connections and most were pretty grungy.  I
ended up starting at the ends and pulling every connection and cleaning
them
up.  I took the front & rear lenses apart and cleaned them, cleaned the
bulb
sockets, etc.  Last was pulling down the fuse panel and the light and
emergency switches and cleaning all them.  Also the instrument panel,
checked and cleaned all the wires to them.  While under the car I noticed
the gas tank hoses were leaking from the FI conversion fiddling so pulled
the tank to replace them.  "While I was in there" hit and I pulled the
fresh air
fan to check it, ended up swapping the parts car fan motor in.  Cleaned the
junk and rust spots up on tank and body (those fiber pads under the tank
are
great water trappers). Used POR-15 on the cleaned up spots and replaced the
fiber pads with closed cell foam rubber. Got the tank back in, then back to
the electrical.
Got all the gremlins fixed now except the turn signals.  Narrowed that to
the turn signal switch. I'd planned to replace but delayed so just ordered
one from GPR.  Once that is in I can put the fuse panel and light
switches back and the car is drivable again.
Next plan is to gut the interior and deal with the surface rust.  I want to
open the plugs into the heater duct/ inner rocker area and check.  From
outside I don't see rust other than spots of surface rust I've dealt with.
I have a undercoating wand and some of the waxy type stuff I want to use in
that area if it is ok. Have a new carpet kit waiting.  The dash from the
parts car was almost perfect, one little crack so will use it.  I'll be
removing the floorboard pads so will have to replace those with either
similar stuff or maybe Dynamat.

Other things waiting to go on.  I have a 19mm master cylinder.  Got BMW
calipers
from a friends parts car, free. Had George machine them and have rebuild
kits waiting. Got George's adjustable proportioning valve kit. Bump steer
kit.
Bronze bushings for pedal cluster.  Need to replace the cracked front
windshield.
Remount the rattling rear window.  Have a Jacobs OmniPak to put on and will
make
a set of custom length plug wires with the better Corvair type air seals.
Longer term I want to get the 1.7L spare motor on a test stand and check it
out, then swap it into the car for the 2.0L and start going over the 2.0.
While swapping I need to pull the rear engine pad and deal with some
surface rust behind it and also replace the battery tray and clean up
surface rust under the battery tray area.

I want to at least pull the 2.0 heads and check for the 'big bore' cylinder
size,
check the compression ratio, etc. The seal behind the flywheel is leaking
so
need to change that.  I don't really trust that 'rebuild' so depending on
what I find I may put it back or I may take it down and rebuild it myself.
Thinking of various things, having the heads checked and valve seat job
done
by Mark Stephens, possibly Total Seal rings and no head gasket like JJ's
setup.  Will just have to see what I find.
Still have to park outside so with the short days and now El Nino rain the
914 is under several tarps just waiting.

Jeez that got long. Hope I didn't' bore too many ;-)
