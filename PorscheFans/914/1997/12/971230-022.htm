  Hi Dave!

  As always your comments are thoughtful and informative... I am
especially interested in your off-hand comment that the valves are
easier to get at with the road wheel off.   I have yet to paint and
install all of the "S" ducts and other assorted paraphenalia that
connect to the heat exchangers, and I have been wondering how on
earth I am going to reach stuff that is already hard to reach now...
I will keep this in mind.

   Believe me,  I would if I could, but I can't!   When I had the
engine apart for a top-end overhaul, I had all of the tappets out of
the case but one... you guessed it, # 4 intake.  It moved around in
it's bore OK, but nothing that I could do would persuade it to come
out.  I didn't have any more money to invest, and since the oil
pressure was OK at the time, and even more miraculous, the engine
didn't (and still doesn't) leak a drop at the case seam, I shrugged
off the problem.   B I G MISTAKE!

  I should have split the case and fixed what I found, which would
probably entail bearings, a new cam, and 8 new tappets.   I have a
spare engine, and when I get around to it, I'll swap them out...
maybe then I can slowly accumulate enough funds to rebuild the bottom
end as should have been done the first time.   

  My suggestion to the list would be to learn from my error:  If you
can't extract all of the tappets through the outside of the case, 
take the engine the rest of the way apart and fix it!   A tappet that
won't come out of it's bore is a dead give-away of a serious problem!

   I am open to suggestions as to whose tappets I should use when I
do get around to splitting the case... I am reluctant to use Porsche
originals, as my engine  is the second case of this problem that I
have heard of via the list.  My ideal tappet would be diamond;
following that nitrided chrome steel, or something else unbelievably
hard... at least twice as hard on the mhos scale as original
equipment.    Any ideas would be appreciated; tappets should last the
life of the car, IMHO.

					Thanks,
                                                            Jim T.
