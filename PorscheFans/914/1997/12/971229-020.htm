Well folks, only 28 of the 522+ list members (approx 5 percent) responded to
the Christmas Greetings request.  That's not enough for an accurate sample,
but here's some stats generated from the Christmas Intro's anyway (just for
fun!).

Do these figures realistically represent the mailing list?  Probably not.

Location:
Eastern US - 15 pct
Midwest US - 27 pct
Southern US - 15 pct
Western US - 38 pct
Canada - 4 pct

Model Year (I'll have to check this against production figures some day):
1970 - 3 pct
1972 - 7 pct
1973 - 34 pct
1974 - 41 pct
1975 - 7 pct
1976 - 7 pct

Engine:
1.7L/4 - 13 pct
1.8L/4 - 10 pct
2.0L/4 - 65 pct (Wow! Many of these did not start life as a 2.0L)
2.4L/4 - 3 pct
2.0L/6 - 3 pct
3.0L/6 - 3 pct
3.2L/6 - 3 pct

Reads list but doesn't currently own a 914: 7 pct.

It was interesting how many people mentioned their 914 as an "impulse buy",
and how many are "currently under construction".

Even more interesting is the question - WHERE'S THE WOMEN?.  Are there any
of you female sorts lurking about the list?  What's you're story?

Have a happy and safe New Year!
Jeffrey Dunning
