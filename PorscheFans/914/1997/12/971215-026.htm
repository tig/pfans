Dirk,

Maybe I wasn't clear enough.  You are right about all those prices...my
point was, he's planning to do P/Cs anyway; if its possible to avoid
bearings, why not?  Besides, $100 a set for those little pieces of metal
isn't what I'd call a bargain...oh, and BTW, the #8 main bearing is $150
by itself (not part of the sets).  Anytime the crank comes out, it
really should be polished; plus seals and stretch bolts and nuts
and...well, you get the idea. The last time I did a bottom end, the
parts were $500+; just to take the case apart and put it back together.
