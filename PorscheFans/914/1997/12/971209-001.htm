Thanks Marc, this is getting interesting. You say that the hand throttle on
the 914/6 attaches to the bell crank at the accelerator pedal. Does this
mean that the accelerator pedal assembly is different than the 4 cylinder
cars? What I'm getting at is that I'm wondering if the hand throttle
mechanism will connect up to the 4 cylinder accelerator pedal assembly. This
could be a way-cool feature I could add to my car, if I could ever find a
914/6 hand throttle, that is!! Hmmm, let's see, 1700 914/6's imported to the
states, less than half still on the road (well, maybe a little better, who
knows?), not too many out there to scavange parts from. I'll bet AA wants a
million bucks each for them!!
