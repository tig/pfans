Dirk, I think you may be missing an important point here.  I assume you
are planning to run 40 or 44 IDFs in place of your (much better or
course) FI.  If that is the case then you probably need to be aware that
IDFs do not have choke mechanisms.  If you're NOT planning to use IDFs
then skip to the last paragraph cuz the rest of this won't apply.

The way I understand chokes to work is twofold.  1 they cause a higher
idle and 2 they close (or partially close, depending on temperature) a
butterfly valve at the top of the carb, thus creating a rich condition.
So since the IDFs don't have that secondary butterfly in them you can
increase the idle, but there's no way to force the rich condition (other
than revving the engine, thus utilizing the accelerator pump which is
what I've always done).

My experience with IDFs is that after the first few minutes the engine
won't die at idle so unless you want to do unattended warmups (let your
car run while you finish your coffee in you house) then your proposed
choke is useless because your foot will do the job just fine once you're
in the car.

Maybe I'm missing something here, but that's how it looks to me.

If you're dead set on the choke thing though, just get a generic one,
install it in the dash or console, run the cabel down the tunnel to the
top of the engine and attach it to the carb linkage in the engine
compartment.  I know a lot (if not all) of the early 80s RX7s (and
probably some others) had manual chokes so maybe you could get one cheap
at a bone yard.  Or check JC Whipme for a 'generic' choke and go for it.

Good luck.
