I'd agree.  My engine is partially balanced (pistons and rods), not
blueprinted, but carefully assembled in my basement last year.  This past
autocross season saw the tach climb into the 6800 to 7000 range a number of
times, most of the time not intentional.  I was usually in no-man's land
where I couldn't shift again, but I couldn't slow down yet either! 

The valves are still right on the mark and everything is still tight.  The
only difference in my valve train would be heavy-duty valve springs.  But
I'd also agree that there wasn't much power up there.

Knowing the valve train is the weekest link in the system, what are the
best ways to strengthen it?
