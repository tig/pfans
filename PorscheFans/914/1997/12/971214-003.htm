And why would that be? 

14.8 Suspension

A.
     Ride height may only be altered by suspension adjustments, the use
of
     spacing blocks, leaf spring shackles, torsion bar levers, or change
or
     modification of springs or coil spring perches. This does not allow
the
     use of spacers which alter suspension geometry, such as those
between
     the hub carrier and lower suspension arm. Springs must be of the
same
     type as the original (coil, leaf, torsion bar, etc.) and except as
     noted herein, must use the original spring attachment points. Coil
     spring perches originally attached to struts or shock absorber
bodies
     may be changed or altered, and their position may be adjustable.
     Spacers are allowed above or below the spring. The addition of
     "coil-over" springs where none existed on the original vehicle is
     specifically prohibited."

It's perfectly legal. THe definition of "coil over" in this rule is any
coil spring which is inserted or mounted over the shock tube. In this
case, teh rear of a 914 can be considered a "coil-over" while the front
may not.
