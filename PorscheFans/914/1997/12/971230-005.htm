	Lots and lots of options.  How much money do you have to spend
on the project?
	You can do anything from dropping in a 1.7 motor (gains you
about 4 HP), dropping in a 2.0 (gains about 19 HP), to re-working your
1.8 (bad changes can lose power, a heavily-modified one can get up to
about 160 HP), to dropping in a 911 motor (270 HP from a stock 993 3.6!)
or even a big 'Murkin V8 (what, 350+ HP?).
	The least-expensive options are probably the first two--dropping
in a different 914 motor.  They require the least amount of work.
	You could do some head-work on the 1.8 and probably get a little
bit of power (5-10 HP?) at the expense of having to use better gasoline.
Anything more, and you will need to open up the case--and "While you're
in there", you might as well do the complete overhaul thing.  (Is this
espensive enough yet?)  At that point, you can do a few more things,
like bump the displacement up (maybe up to 2.4 liters, if you want to
spring for the parts!!), put in a slightly more aggressive cam, etc.  You
will want to balance the living heck out of everything so that the motor
has a chance to last a little while, and so you can spin it fast enough
to take advantage of the new cam.  Of course, you will now have to start
tweaking the FI to deal with the new motor, and that can get expensive
unless you can do the tweaking yourself.  And that means having some way
of measuring the mixture.
	So, is this expensive enough for ya yet?
	BTW, the 160 HP 1.8 motors are interesting and costly things.  A
dead give-away (usually) is the sewer pipe through the cockpit, ducting
cool air from the headlights to the engine.  And the engine really needs
it, because the fan generally has very few (1/3) blades left.  Cuts down
on power losses caused by moving all that air, to be sure!  But it would
really suck in stop-and-go traffic...

	Enough of that tangent.
