We have had many inquiries concerning our aluminum front hubs and hopefully
this posting will clear up most of those questions.  GP Chassis
manufactures an aluminum hub that is compatible with several types of
vented rotors and many different types of calipers.  This hub is intended
to strictly replace the stock 914 steel hub/rotor assembly with an updated
aluminum version.  This hub simply bolts on to your existing 914 strut
whether you want to retain a 4-bolt or use a 5-bolt pattern.  Because of
the 4-bolts we are forced to use a Coleman .810 inch rotor (Coleman's
number is 1-906-863-7883, if you want to call them direct.  They are
located in Menominee, MI).  The 5-bolt version uses a 911 front rotor.  A
wide range of calipers may be used such as the 911 rear, BMW 320, or a BMW
Bavaria 4-piston.  The single pad area for the 914 stock is 4.13 sq in; the
911 rear is 4.6 sq in; the BMW 320 is 5.66 sq in; the BMW 4 piston is 7.2
sq in.  Compare this to 5.3 sq in for a 911 SC front and 6.6 sq in for a
930 Turbo.  All of the BMW and 911 rear calipers bolt up directly to the
stock 914 strut.  Our aluminum hub has been designed such that either the
Coleman or the factory 911 rotor is properly positioned for any of the
calipers.  These combinations can be used on 15 inch or larger wheels. 
Offset is the same as the original 914 hub.  Although we can even do
specials of these keeping in mind that the front track should be as wide as
possible.  If you order the rotors from GP Chassis we can fire-slot them
for you at a nominal charge.  The BMW calipers are preferred because of
their availability and price (the BMW 320 caliper used is approximately $30
each; the BMW 4 piston is approximately $75 ea used; some Brembo aluminum
calipers exist and we are trying to procure a set to determine their
usefulness).  Our hubs come with stock 914 bearings and races and will have
installed 911 style studs.  If you have any additional questions, please
don't hesitate to call us at our toll free number 1-888-561-8937.  Also,
please visit our web site at www.gpchassis.com.  These parts are not
currently listed in our catalog that you will find on our web page but will
soon be included with pictures.  Thanks for your interest and yes, we do
want your business.
