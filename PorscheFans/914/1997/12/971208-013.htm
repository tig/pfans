	The valve is solenoid-operated, so it may indeed matter.  Though
if it really did, I'm curious as to why the socket for the plug doesn't
have the two diagonal corners that keep you from plugging in the wrong way
around...
	If you want to make sure, then check another injector plug.  Pull
it off the injector, check continuity between each side and ground.  You
should only get it on one side (I think) with the motor off.  Only one of
your loose wires should give you continuity to ground, so that one goes in
the same place as the other one that does.

	The voltage gauge in the dash is only there for "amusement value";
it is far from a reliable indicator of ...  well, of *anything*.  If you
want to see the health of your charging system, measure the voltage across
the battery terminals (themselves, not the wires or anything else!).  If
you still see these changes (particularly if the voltage goes down to 12.6
or so with the engine above 2K RPM) then you have a charging system problem.

	Anecdotal evidence says, "no":
	When my alternator died, I ran my car for 45 minutes on a battery
that was so dead that it wouldn't start the car.  (Got a jump-start to get
it going.)  It eventually got so bad (console gauge down to <8V) that when
I put on a turn signal, or brake lights, or ANYTHING that used electricity,
the engine would cut out alltogether.  But it ran fine until it did that.
	Oh, this was before the Allison ignition went in, so your results
may be different!
	BTW, I didn't get the timing for a stoplight about 1.5 miles from
home.  I had to hit the brakes, and the brake lights killed the motor.  I
walked from there, then came back and picked up the battery so I could
charge it at home.  I had the alternator rebuilt the next week.
