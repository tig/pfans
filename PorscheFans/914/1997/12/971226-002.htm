I have a new set of pads in front (from GPR) that I put in, with lots of
"anti-squeal" compound on the backs of them.  All I did here was change
the
pads and now the car sounds like a frigging volvo with the annoying
squeal
that I'm getting.  Squeal sorta goes away as the brakes get warmer...

Thom, I had a similar problem with my '74 Karmann Ghia.  After the pad
change, the noise actually got worse.  I thought the calipers were ok
and hesitated opening them cuz rebuild kits are NLA.  Finally, I opened
them and the orifices between the sides was plugged with crud. 
Fortunately the seals all looked good, so  I was able to clean them and
reassemble.  I also had the rotors turned.  The squeal completely
disappeared.  I figure the pad pressure on the opposite sides of the
rotor was unequal and that was the primary cause of the squeal.
