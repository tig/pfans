Seasons Greetings to all of you old 914 die hards. El Nino will pass, but
you guys will always be ahead of the storm with this list knowledge base you
alone provide. Thanks for all the best information ever for the 914 here and
on Tims page. Christmas is every day for all of us users of these lists.

Any one interested in a set of 2.0 heads. They were in a submerged 914 for
about 5 months. Thats another story from last year. 914s are not suitable as
submarines.

I do not guarantee these heads as I can only see corrosion, but no cracks
visible. Valves are still intact or should I say "frozen". They are from a
1973 S  I previously owned. Don't know if they will clean up, but I offer
both heads for a GOOD side shifter tranny if you are that interested in an
even trade. I will also need the shifter bars. You pay shipping for these
tranny items and I pay shipping for the 2 heads.
Reply on the list to keep all interested persons aware. No shipping outside
of the US.

My phone number, 901 388-8525, and I am usually home all the time.
