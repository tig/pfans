Josh, Dirk,

I wonder if Dirk is referring to the Warmup Reg.

As far as I know, the Audis come with a vacuum controlled "warm-up"
regulator.  Look at the warm-up reg on the block by the oil filter, and see
if it has a vacuum line attached.  This device richens up the mixture at
WOT.

On our CIS VWs, we don't bother with anything else.   The CIS system gives
excellent throttle response, as long as the flywheel has been lightened.
We get the "trick" warmup reg from a 2.0 Audi engine.


cheers, Brian Ng
