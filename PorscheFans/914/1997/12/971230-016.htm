	Well, we can hope that most people on the list realize that the
914 as sold in the showrooms (skinny 165 tires and all!) is still a beast
that is marvelously fun to drive!
	But there is a place for modifications.  (Particularly suspension
mods!)  They do increase the fun factor--but not as much as buying the
car in the first place.  (IMHO, of course!)

	Wheeeee!  I came in second in class this year (boy I'm glad Brooks
has been bit by the Sticky Tires bug!!) but I did manage to take the class
my rookie year, 1994.  Thankfully this is against other stock 914s without
sticky tires.  But taking TToD isn't everything.  (Boy am I glad some of my
911 friends didn't hear me say that...  Oh--Hi, fellas!  Just teasing!)

	It is awfully easy to dream of more power, though.  One of the
really beautiful things about the 914 is that it is very easy to modify.
And, since it does feel a bit under-powered to start with, power modifi-
cations are popular.
	And, well, ya see, I've got this pipe dream of buying a nice 70 or
71 roller, and building it into a lovely 3.2 liter Six...  Ummm....
Maybe when I get a bigger garage.  And a MUCH bigger savings account.
