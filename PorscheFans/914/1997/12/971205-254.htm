Hi all!

	Well, who am I to stand in the path of tradition? Lest I get runover...

	Some of you know me, some of you know _of_ me. My name's Joshua Hadler,
29, and have been a 'teener nut for almost five years now. Up until this
year I was living and working in Palo Alto CA at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center. High energy physics research, yeah... I smashed
atoms for a living. :) The last year has seen some pretty big changes
for me, some good and some bad, but they have led me back to Boulder
Colorado where I grew up. I can think of worse places to live to be
sure. So now after a bit of an employment hiatus, I'm working at the
University of Colorado, Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics,
yeah... now I guess I'm a rocket scientist. Drat, now I can't even use
the phrase "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to do that...". 

 Oh yeah, cars! I've probably been a car nut since birth, it's probably
genetic. My folks have gone thru some pretty amazing cars in the past.
Some I only hear of spoken in tales and stories. Like the Healey 3000
with the tricked out motor and race suspension that had to be (shudder)
abondoned (shudder again) due to a cracked head, during a cross country
drive. But anyway, it wasn't until my exposure to a fine german driving
machine that really sparked it. No, it wasn't a bimmer or a P-car. It
was a 1986 VW GTI. Fun car, and I rapidly began poking around fixing
things that broke and I was convinced that simply fixing it wasn't
enough. I needed to 'FIX' it as well. So in my endevours to learn about
the car and what I could do with it I learned about autox. Thinking "I'm
a pretty good driver (hah!), I'll give it a try!". Well my first run was
by myself and I thought I was cooking. I knew I was holding back a
little, but I thought I did pretty good. Then I went for a ride with a
veteran autoxer in his -stock- Honda Civic. WOW! I was blown away. And I
was hooked right then and there. So I started autoxing more regularly. I
did this for quite a time in the VW. But the unfortunate occured, and
the VeeWee had to sacrifice itself to save it's occupant, me. It was a
rollover while autoxing, but did that stop me? Hell no! I wanted to jump
right back in so I could unlearn what I did wrong before. But I wanted
to do it in a car that wasn't quite as likely to leave me hanging
upsidedown from my harness.

	So my quest began, I had already started eyeing P-cars as friend of
mine had gradually upgraded his 911 via insurance companies to his
present '69 911E. And I started to think about 911s untill someone said
(and to this day, I hate/love them for it) "you know, I'd rally like to
see somebody build a competetive C-Street Prepared 914". Duuuhh, ok I'll
give it a try. So I researched and searched and scoured untill I found
the best sample I could afford. And the rest as they say... is pure joy!
Over the years I have gradually replaced or upgraded most every
component on the car, and have enjoyed every skinned knuckle (well
almost) that it's given me. But I'll tell you what, I think I could
honestly steal something out of a mailbox now. Learning all sorts of
contorsionist tricks while working on this car I think I could get my
arm around that trap door. ;)

	So, there's a not-so-brief intro for me. 

Hmm, it's getting late, and I've got to prep the car tomorow for
sunday's Trials event. Zoom! I hope to see some of you out at the
track(s) someday!

-Josh2
