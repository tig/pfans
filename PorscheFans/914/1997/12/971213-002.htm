Bernie,

I've run the 205/50s. They're great runners but you're speedo will be off
about 10 mph. A good compromise is to run 195/60 or 205/60s in a high
speed rating. That said, if cornering is real high on your priority list
go with the 50 series tires and live with the higher RPM. BTW the lower
profile tire also lowers the car 8-)).

	Here's a new subject :-)
	What are some good modern tires that work  on these cars.
	I want performance, not longevity.  So f I'm down to two,
Dunlop D60A2 in the above size and Michelin MXV4 in above  size.  I
really don't care about  size,  except that the  ones on  there are
already short enough.  I  get 22mph/1000rpm  meaning it allready  screams
on the highway.  My original   intent was to get Comp  T/A Gen 3 in
205-50,
but  I  don't know of anyone doing that or how bad  the  lower gearing
would  be.  This    isn't for racing or just around town.  I do a lot
of highway stuff too.   Please help.
