Dear SEB,

I have several concerns about the current classification of the Porsche
914 2.0 liter and 1.7, 1.8 cars in CSP.

1) Why are the 2.0 cars separated from the 1.7, 1.8 cars onto different
lines? Since all 914s have the same body style, especially cars from the
same model year, you would have to check the serial number to tell the
difference. This restriction makes running the 914 more expensive because
you have to be in a "numbers match" situation. Why allow all 911s
spanning nearly 30 years to remain on one line while penalizing 914s by
separating them onto separate lines?

2) Street Prepared rules allow headers and aftermarket exhaust systems.
Unfortunately, the 914 has heat exchangers wrapped around the exhaust
pipes, so changing to headers would be illegal because the heating system
would be modified. Therefore I propose that Porsche 914s be moved to DSP,
because very little additional power can be made with a stock exhaust in
a 914.

3) If the Porsche 914-4s were moved to DSP the Fiat/Bertone X1/9 need to
be all consolidated onto one line also.

I have heard rumors that the SEB is considering adding another Street
Prepared class incorporating the faster DSP and slower CSP cars. I think
this is a GREAT idea. Please consider putting the Porsche 914,
Fiat/Bertone X1/9 and the Toyota MR-2 together in that class.

Thanks for your great work and consideration of my proposal.

Sincerely,
Benjamin D. Thatcher

Hey there every body.  I have a friend that is looking for a 86 to 89 944.
Black on Red, Black on Black, or Red on Black.  Non smoker, no cracks, good
dash board and good body in and out. If you live in the north west, that is
definately a plus, for she lives in the Seattle area.  If anybody knows of one
that might fit the discription, please Email me and i can forward it to her.

Thanx
