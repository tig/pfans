Season's greetings P-nuts!

Christmas intro? my turn...I'm Thom Kuby...

The 914 list isn't a big community...rather a "little village" and that's
fine with me...I'm not certain we could get away with this on the 911 list,
at least not to this extent.

I am married, with an eighteen year-old step-daughter.  My wife totally
understands my being a carguy...how do you argue with a spouse who gives
you P-cars for Valentine's Day, Christmas etc? I'm not kidding, two of my
full-scale P-cars have come to me this way...difficult to ignore a woman
like that, eh?

I currently drive a '74 914 2.0 liter, which functions as a "daily driver"
and I sometimes find myself doubting it's value as such-simply because the
streets in this Mojave-desert town I live in are so shitty...but that's
hardly the car's fault...regardless it's a wonderful car, and I have done a
voluminous amount of work in the engine room, replaced the original shocks,
fixed a whole bunch of little stuff on it and the interior has been
re-done...I drive it every day and it's never boring.  Right now, as I
speak the brakes are acting up with a pathetic squealing - sounds like a
Volvo!  gotta fix that.

I also have a '68 912 vintage racer project...this is the apple of my eye.
I am about halfway done building it. Right now, we have been completely
painted a creamy vanilla color, and are waiting additional funds in order
to tear into the suspension...I have two complete engines for the little
guy.  I look forward to auto-xs, time trials and the occasional vintage
wheel-to-wheel event next year (I hope...)

And if this isn't enough, I also have a running, drivable '36 Cord
Westchester sedan as well as arestored '37 Willys "Model 37" coupe to keep
my p-cars company.and..yes, I would really like to add either a '59A or a
'65C 356 to my stable.  The Cord is especially interesting...there are many
parallels between it and rear-engined Porsches, mostly from an attitude
standpoint (e.g. engineering, styling etc)

I write for a living.

Currently, I work for the Navy in support of the F/A-18 program.  My
tasking requires a secret clearance, so let it suffice to say I work on
"stuff" ...when I'm not at the airfield, I am out in the garage farting
around or I am hustling Bid & Proposal jobs on my own, in order to sustain
my  Habit.

And...speaking of German Metal Habit, since there is absolutely NO WAY I
could ever own all these cool Porsches in my lifetime...I am deep into
models.  I concentrate on the die-cast stuff, simply because I don't have
much time to devote to building anything worthwhile...I have about 135
P-cars of varying scales and quality, and the collection grows, almost on a
monthly basis...I love it.  I find myself gravitating towards racers... the
collection is starting to get real interesting.

When I'm not screwing around with cars, I am usually involved in Music...I
love Jazz, Blues, Claasical, New Age, and whatever else The Kid brings
home...I try to have an open mind and sense of humor.  I have also finished
my first year in law school...I'm going real slow on this since the wife
really needs to finish her education too...but, rest assured, I'm not so
keen on being an attorney as such...but rather to understand "the system"
and have a measure of self defense at that.  Studying Law is an absolute
riot...why screw it all up with trying to find "a job", eh?

Happy Holidays to all of you...and thanks for all this bandwidth

Cheers
Thom Kuby
