Though I'm always 'behind the times' due to Digest Mode, I'm always 
compelled to respond to things I'm familiar with (which is why I 
contribute so rarly :)

Anyway, regarding the 'how-should-I-neutralize-my-spilled-battery-acid' 
debate, I thought it should be pointed out that while an acid/base 
reaction does create a salt resultant, it is a salt in the chemical 
sense only:
         any acid + any base  -->  a salt + hydrogen

where the 'salt' is just the acid, with it's hydrogen ions replaced by 
cations from the base (hence the leftover hydrogen ions in the 
resultant)

In other words, the salt produced by the acid/base reaction from this 
particular instance [sulfuric (battery) acid and baking soda (sodium 
bicarbonate)] is NOT 'road salt' (which is sodium chloride and some 
additives, at least in the part of the country), and is NOT necessarily 
as corrosive. I still wouldn't sprinkle it on my eggs, but you get the 
idea.
