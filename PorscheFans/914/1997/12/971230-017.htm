That's very true. The stock 914 is a fun car.

My opinion after doing much research is that the VW Type IV motor is
basically a pig. It's much better than the VW Type I, but that's not saying
much. The 356 motor is much better than either, but it's only 1600cc.

Whatever you do to the motor to make it perform better usually has negative
consequences also. For example, if you enlarge the valves, you will crack
the head (in the space between the valves). If you enlarge the
displacement, you will overheat the motor, unless you re-engineer the
cooling system. If you do either of the above, the stock Djet will not work
very well. If you enlarge the stroke, the muffler will not fit on the heat
exchangers because the engine is wider. There are a few things that can be
done, but they are mostly window dressing in my opinion. Things like
getting lighter rods, counterweighted crank, aluminum needle bearing rocker
arms, and coating the combustion chamber and piston tops will not adversely
effect the rest of the system, but most of them are very expensive. Let's
see, a set of nice rods is about 500$, a nice crank is a grand, rocker arms
are about 400$, and what would you get?? maybe 10hp? maybe 20?? I don't
know. What I'm basically saying is that whatever you do, it's going to be
expensive, and you may not get much out of it.

The best solution to me seems to be to save your pennies for a six
transplant. Now that's a good motor!
