One thing I've learned from other people is that you have to careful when
you repair the major longitudinal members on a car that is flexing in order
to avoid warping the car. This also applies to the floor pan. I think the
trick is to weld in a temporary brace across the door opening. Also, take
the chassis to a frame shop at least afterward, and probably before doing
the rust repair. I'm reaching on this, since I've never done it, but I
assume that you want the body straight before you repair it, and you want
your worked checked afterward also.
