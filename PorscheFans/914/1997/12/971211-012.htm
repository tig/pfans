Brian,

Thanks for the excellent A-Z 'How to', which is just what I needed.  No 
mention of dropping the lump though!!

Sounds as if many of the 914-ers have tackled the pushrod tube seal oil 
leak problem, which is especially useful for me!!  Thanks to all the 
good listers who e-mailed or replied to my original posting.  Allright 
914 list!!  I hope you won't mind if I use this one (too lengthy 
commentary) to answer the mail:

ON CATASTROPHIC FAILURE:  No-one comments on expecting a catastrophic 
seal blow-out or anything, so I guess I can drive a little while longer 
without too serious a risk before getting 'down to bizness' on the p-rod 
tubes.

ON DRIVING HABITS:  Driving in Italy, and much of Europe is a little 
different than in the states.  High, or higher sustained speeds are 
genuinely a norm here, and if you don't want to be an obstruction-  you 
just keep up.  I don't know how many times a Fiat Brava will blow by me 
at 115-120 mph (200KPH) while I'm 'tootling' along at 85-95.  This is no 
joke.  The problem with the 912E's lack of top end is best illustrated 
by the increase in first noise, and then indicated temperature if 
driving for lengthy periods above 90 mph-  particularly between 4500 RPM 
and top end.  At 85-95 (indicated speed) running a lightly loaded car on 
16" Fuchs, my temperature guage (the original non-specific bar type) 
runs in the top 1/3 to occasionally top 1 /4 (but has not on the last 
three 900-1500 mile trips exceeded the 'green zone').  Above 95mph, as 
the revs and noise rise (!) it quickly gets close to the edge, and I've 
never had the temerity (stupidity?) to run at over 100 mph for any great 
length of time.  (In heavy rain the motor not surprisingly runs a lot 
cooler than 'norm' at high speed-  but the drawback is increased pucker 
on curvy roads and generally not liking wet car scenes.)

ON 4-POT '911' BODIED CARS: And there's 'the rub' with 912E's-  you 
cannot afford to be in too much of a hurry!!  The car simply won't 
entertain it!!  Bit silly in a coupe that looks like it'll rip your lips 
off-  but I can live with it because the safety to fun equation is 
pretty high in an underpowered car with superb handling.

THE PLUS SIDE:   On twisting mountain roads, such as the ones North of 
Rome from Grotaglia onwards to Bologna and Firenza, or the ones just 
North of Genoa, the excellent balance, weight distribution, roadholding 
and adequate thrust of the 2.0 makes the car seem very quick compared to 
the saloons that normally blow by  on the straighter lengths of 
Autostrada, Superstrada or even risky but straightish A-roads.  The 
average speed of 65 mph 'across' twisty country is entirely do-able- 
which you'll note means a good rate of knots in the driving bits, with 
stops every 90-120 mins or so.  

NOW I'M WORRIED:   Is the motor overheating, or damaging itself given 
the use I'm putting it to?  Er...I don't know yet!!  YOU GUYS TELL ME!!   
At least the guages say it's OK, but you guys probably know these motors 
a lot better than I do.  The flickering green oil light is not in any 
sense omnipresent-  but pretty consistently shines on when after driving 
for an hour or so at good speed (as above) , usually between 3500-3900 
RPM in 5th gear and then confronted with a sudden slow down to idle (as 
in arriving at a toll booth on the Tangenziale of a big town)- but not 
in normal town-country driving and never when the car is driven at 
moderate speeds (60-70 mph) when the indicated temperature is normally 
at half way along the guage scale.  Phew...sorry for all the detail, 
Doctor...just had to get it out in English!! 

BTW, I've racked up 12,000 miles in the last 11 months (two services), 
but still enjoy strapping on my slightly leaky 4-banger.

MILLE GRAZIE:  To all 914 Freaks, again thanks! !  Have a great Holiday 
Season, and if you think of something I need to know- 

anytime for e-mail, leads on cheap-but-good used spares,  or Porsche 
chit.

Grazie Tutti!!
