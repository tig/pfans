Hi guys,

Uh, I have had my liners off the pistons several times in the last couple
years with no ill effects. Once after a valve guide pulled out when the
engine was stopped. Then later (just last summer) when the motor was
completely flooded with water after a 4 inch rain gusher (still trying to
figure out how the water got inside the motor).

I tore the engine down to the case, dried everything out, ran the hones
on the cylinders, put it all back together and everything runs fine and
no smoke.

   My understanding is that aircraft engine practice is that as long
as the rings never leave the bore, you can move the jug around, and
even slide it out far enough to pull the gudgeon pin and remove the
piston and cylinder assembly from the rod to split the bottom end,
and still retain the rings.
   Once the rings leave the bore, however, they are throw-away items.
  The jug must be honed, and new rings installed.   Obviously, if
your cylinders are in as good a shape as you depict, only a light
honing, enough to "brake the glaze" is necessary, and should not
shorten cylinder life appreciably.

   Just my $.02.
