Bernie: I was running a set of these Riverias when I first got my '75
2.0. The first tire that I 've run with them turned out to be a super
value: Yokohama A509 in 195-60X15. These have been great handling and
wearing, but clearance was close on one side, and I had to roll the
fender lip. The Mahle's would probably allow you to run a 205-60 which
is a very close match to the rolling radius of the original equipment
tires for this car. The 195-60's are a little shorter, and I find them a
bit buzzy on the highway. Another choice might be the 195-65 A00P
Yokohama's for the taller tire, not sure of the clearance with the Riv's
though. I have since acquired some Fuch's with the proper offset, and
will go with one of these choices on my next
set.                                                        Jim S.
