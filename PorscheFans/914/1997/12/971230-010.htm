Dirk,

The FI should be able to handle this just fine. To an extent... Sure, if
you slap a 70mm throttle body on there you'll get some weird behaviour with
the air flow. But the basic principle of this FI is that it measures the
vacuum produced in the manifold and adjusts the fuel accordingly. If there
is less air to draw into the throttle body (like up here at 6,000 ft) than
it will reduce the fuel accordingly. And the same applies if it gets more
air through the plennum, it will increase the ammount of fuel. The stock
throttle body is _tiny_ at 45mm to feed all four cylinders. Especially when
you consider that a carbed engine is drawing air through 40mm bodies for
each cylinder! FI is the basic rule of supply and demand. The more air you
can supply, the more fuel the 'computer' will demand.

The only real problem I see with a different T-body is addapting the TPS to
fit and hopefully having an appropriately placed vacuum port for ignition
advance. Other than that, it's just a matter of making it fit.

Of course, as always, this just my opinion...
