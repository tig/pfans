I've recently located a parts car for myself. I will get the wheels,
tires and longlblovk 1.8 to use for a rebuild. I am going Saturday the
26th to check this car out, as it is now complete and running (but
crashed and not driveable). It appears to have dual 40 webers in good
shape and jetted properly for 1.8. If anyone is interested in these, let
me know (guitarsmit@aol.com) and I will pass your name on to the seller
(or vice versa). He wants around $200 for them.

yeah,

I am in the process of adding a subwoofer and amp to my stereo system.  I need
to know where there are holes in the (1) gas tank wall so that I can route my
speaker wire and power wire from the amp and (2) I need to find a hole in the
firewall in which I can put the power wire for the amp, to get to the battery.
I would like to avoid the drill if I can.  Anyone know where these holes are?
