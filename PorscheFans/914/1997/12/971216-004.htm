On my 73 1.7 the oil cooler is located on the passenger side of the tranny,
there is this huge space there and it fits nicely just of set enough that
road goo doesnt get in there. As far as stuff dammaging it, i occassionally
abuse my mistress by taking her off roads, through ice and snow, and well,
you get eh idea. Works fine so far as i can see. Anyone else have one
mounted there? and i think it qulifies for the rules you are triing for.

Hi guys, My 914 is getting steel GT flares, 911 suspension,  and 7&8 by 15
Fuchs. I need to get good autocross/street tires. The Yokohama AVS is my first
choice. I want to use 225/50/15 front and 255/45/15 rear. Questions are: Is
this a good size choice? Are the rims the acceptable widths these tire sizes?
Would 205/55/15 front and 225/50/15 rears be a better choice? Or could I
simply put 225/50/15 all around, on 7 &8 inch wheels? Any advice or experience
with AVS's or another brand? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you, Ed
Villela
