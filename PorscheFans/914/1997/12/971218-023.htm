Hi all,

I asked a while ago about tires for my 914.  I have the Mahle wheels and 
I went with 205/60/15s.  The car had stock tires previously - 165/15 (the 
lack of profile number indicates a default of 80, I think, ie. 
165/80-15).  The info I received from this group was pretty universally 
to get Yokos, either A509 or AVS-i.  After some soul-searching, I decided 
that I really had no intention of any racing, and so a tire that wore out 
in about 10-15 k miles was not the best choice.  The Yokos are not cheap 
either.  (BTW-I would skip the A509 and go with AVS-i or something else 
that is V-rated or higher if I needed the extreme performance.)  I bought 
what is going to sound like a really strange tire - a Winston Winner HP.  
This is a "H" rated tire (like the A509 in this size) and has a large 
block assymetric tread design.  It's very reasonably priced, made by the 
same company as Goodrich, and available in a huge variety of sizes.  It 
also will last much longer.  They have been a HUGE improvement to the 
car, though my previous experience was just with Michelin XZXs in the 
165-15.  I live in the hills and so this car sees daily twisties.
