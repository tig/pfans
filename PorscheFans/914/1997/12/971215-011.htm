	The Mahles should.  I believe that they have the same (or almost
the same) offset as the Fuchs wheels.  The Rivieras probabaly won't.

	I don't like the D60A2, either.  I have 'em on my CRX, and I don't
think they hold the road all *that* well.  (Not much better than the stock
Michelens did.)  Noisy mothers, too.
	I found that the A509s are quite nice all around.  When I went from
195/60-15 to 195/50-15 the difference in feedback from the car was astounding.
Also, brand-new AVS-i's are noticeably better than old worn-out A509s in the
same size (the 50-series).
	If DRY performance is ALL that you want, get some 205/60-15 BFG R1s.
They won't last, they can be dangerous in the wet, but BOY OH BOY will they
hang onto the road.  (They're dangerous in the wet mostly because you will
remember what they can do in the dry and may try approaching those limits.)
	Ditto with any of the soft-compound tires.  If you want hard-compound
ones, then check into things like the A008-P.  The P-Zero is also an option,
but I'm never sure about the quality of Pirelli tires.  These tires have met
Porsche's tests and are OEM (or specified replacements) on at least SOME
Porsches.
	The 509s, the AVS'es, the RE71s that Josh2 mentioned last week, are
all pretty good tires.  They may be what you want in a daily driver.

	What are other peoples favorite street tires?
