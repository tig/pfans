In PCA or SCCA, any kind of major transplant job like that will
emidiately place you into the monster fire breathing modified classes.
These are BIG BUCKS classes. Some PCA clubs won't allow a non P-motor,
just a bit of snobism. Either way, if you want to be competetive, you
will spend a phenomenal amount of money it won't even be _CLOSE_ to
being a street car. Can you play in those classes with a street car?
Sure, nothing's gonna stop you, but if want to be competetive and are
currently investigating a car, you should really decide what you want to
do, and how much you _think_ you can afford. Just keep in mind that no
matter what that number is, you'll wind up dishing out at least twice
that in the end.

What would make a good E-mod car? Probably a 914 with a supercharged
ported rotary engine. WHat would make a great weekend racer/driver? A
1973 2.0L 914-4. In either B-Stock (very tough class) or C-Street
Prepared (just as tough). But the 914 is a truly rewarding car to drive
and you will always have a grin on your face when you get out. I know I
do.

This 914 list is as good a place as any. But 914s are 25years old and
need to be thoroughly inspected by an expert or a shop that KNOWS 914s.

Good luck. And let us know if we can be of any further help.
