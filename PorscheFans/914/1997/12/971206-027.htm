Since we have folks talking about heat exchangers, I thought I'd ask
another question.  I believe running a set of 1.7 exchangers (minus the
sheet metal) on a 2.0 liter motor will increase torque at low rpm's.  Does
this sound right, and does anyone feel this would be beneficial in
autocross applications?

I have a set of 2.0 liter heat exchangers on loan from a friend on the car
right now, but I want to get them off of the car by next season, and I
don't run heat.  I have a spare set of 1.7's sitting in the garage that I'd
like to get cleaned up and maybe jet coated if this is a viable
alternative.  Any opinions on this application would be appreciated.

Second question:  I also have a Supertrap muffler I'd like to hook up to
the above application.  In my mind, this would need to have a custom pipe
connecting the two exchangers together, then bolting on the Supertrap.  Has
anyone tried this or seen this done?  If so, does someone make the pipe to
fit this?  Another thought is to take the front half of a Bursch apart and
connect the Supertrap to the collector.  This would make the Supertrap sit
sideways out the rear of the car.  I don't think this will be an issue
because I don't have a rear valance, just a glass bumper.

Any thoughts on these?

Thanks again,

Dion
