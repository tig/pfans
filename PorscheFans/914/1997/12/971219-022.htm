Now you're confusing me. First you said MFI and then you said CIS. THey
are two entirely different systems. CIS is a proven, nearly bombproof,
reliable system. MFI is a fidgety, sometimes frustrating, but entirely
rewarding (from a driver's standpoint) fuel delivery system. Two
different things entirely. If it's a choice betwen webers and CIS,
there's no choice at all in my book, CIS. Otherwise, I'd go for the MFI
and live with the finikyness.
