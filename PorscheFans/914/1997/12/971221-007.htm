Too big? You mean too tall? 'Cause if you mean too wide, there ain't no
such thing. I regularly ran 205/50-15 and never had any problems. And
ten year old A008Rs tires? Huh? I think they went by a differnt name, I
didn't think that the A008 came out 'till the very late 80s or early
90s. But if they were ten years old, I'm not supprised they felt like
garbage. And the 70 profile isn't going to do any good for handling at
all.

You shouldn't need, or want, more than about 30-32lbs in those tires. At
least not for street use. As for braking, give 'em a chance, they still
have mold release all over 'em. Wait untill about 50 or 100 miles on teh
tires to get the packing slime off the surface. They won't be as
responsive as the A008R tires though. The A008 is a race tire, and has
very stiff sidewalls compared to the A509 which is a budget performance
tire. And I hope you're kidding about the pyrometer...
