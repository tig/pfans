The 912E exhaust is entirely different from 914, but I believe you
will want to drop engine.   Crawl under and look.

>Is there a short cut?  

Cut away the engine tin from above.  :)

>Is this a symptom of switching to synthetic oil?

My experience with Amsoil (synthetic) was overnight swelling of the cork
valve cover gaskets, which allowed all the oil to leak out within 50 miles.
I won't use synoil with uncontained cork gaskets again.

I've never seen a problem with overfilling.

>Your suggestions, comments, and advice are really welcome!!

I have been told that the thermal reactors were a disaster.  They reduce
smog by superheating the exhaust.  That superheats the heads, causing 
all sorts of grief.  I have a spare 912E exhaust with plain pipes instead 
of the thermal reactors, so they may be available somewhere.

With a good engine perimeter seal, the engine should not overheat.  
What is your measure of overheat, anyhow?  

Like the old VW ad:  Water doesn't boil.
Cheers,
