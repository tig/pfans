All right, I'll go next (I get a little long-winded here):

	I live in Golden, CO., where I moved about 3 years ago.  Before
that, I lived in Evergreen, CO., where I was born.  I'm now 22 years
old, and will be getting married next July.  I have worked as a computer
programmer for the last 3 years, and currently write an internet-based
product for nine different brokerage firms.
	My first car was an '82 Honda Civic, which I learned to "race"
in from my friends.  Living in the mountains gave us the freedom of nice
twisty roads, little traffic, and very few cops.  As more and more
people realized how nice Evergreen was, the traffic and cops increased
dramatically, and the illegal racing came to a stop.  After the Honda, I
had a '68 Mercedes Benz 230 (with fins!), and would love to get another
one today.  After an unplanned meeting with an Elk on the highway, I
bought an '82 Rx7 GS.  For a while, I delivered newspapers in the middle
of the night, which gave me a wonderful opportunity to "race" again
without worrying about traffic or cops.  It also let me learn the in's
and out's of small rear-wheel drive sports cars.  After I started making
some decent money, I decided that it was time to get my dream car, a
Porsche 914.  A friend of mine had one in high-school, and the few times
he let me drive it were unforgettable.  My father also has an '86 944
Turbo, which has to be one of the funnest cars around, but it was well
out of my price range.
	The very first 914 I looked at was a '76 2.0 with 500 miles on a
rebuild, and 114,000 total miles.  There was no visible rust, and it had
just been painted a little while ago.  It looked really nice, and after
taking it for a spin, I couldn't pass it up.  The PO was (and still is)
an active member of the PCA here, and he had all of the goodies already
on it.  It came with the center console, and the interior is in great
shape.  It's got 160 lb. springs, and a combination of Bilsteins and
Boges.  It's also got a Weltmeister adjustable sway bar up front, a
front-bumper-mounted oil cooler, and it's been lowered about 2 inches.
I have never driven in or even had a ride in a car that handles so well,
and I know there's still plenty of room to make it handle even better!
The rebuild was done with Euro pistons, so it packed a nice punch.
After having a mechanic check it out, I bought it (and a TON of spare
parts, wheels, etc) for $4750.  I was quite pleased for about 2 months,
when over a period of 2 weeks the compression fell to 70 lbs. on all
four cylinders.  This was to be my first experience with fixing my own
car.  I rebuilt the top end (and never did figure out why the
compression fell... everything looked fine), and drove it for another 3
months, before I dropped a valve seat during a compression check.  This
time, I decided to take my time and spend a little (ha!) money.  I
bought an '83 Rabbit (the newest car I've ever owned) to drive while
working on the 914.  I had the heads (which I found out have been
fly-cut) rebuilt by Mark Stephens high Performance, cleaned up the
pistons and fitted them with total seal rings, and decided to run
without a head gasket.  This leads to a compression ratio of about
8.3:1.  After putting everything back together, I was amazed to have the
car start on the very first try.  This was last May, and I'm still
working out the kinks.  Since then, I have replaced or repaired almost
every single component of the fuel injection, and thanks to Dave
Darling, will have my harness completely refurbished tomorrow morning,
and which point I'll hook it back up and make one more attempt at
passing emissions.  As much bad luck as I've had, I don't regret buying
the 914 at all, because I remember just how much fun it is to drive, and
know that someday, I'll get to drive again.
