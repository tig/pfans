POR-15 is an isocyanide, meaning it is very poisonous. I use Corroless, from
Eastwood. I'm sure there's another source for the stuff, I just haven't
found it yet. Corroless is a combination rust converter and primer and it
has glass flakes in it. You don't need any topcoat unless you want to change
the color (reddish orange). 

First, scrape the rusted area and surrounding painted are until you hit
clean metal. You need a border of clean metal all the way around the
perimeter of the rusty spot. Now sand the area with 60 grit, or even better
is to use a rotary Scotch Brite pad. Blow the dust away and wipe with a
volatile solvent like denatured alcohol to remove all traces of oil and
dirt. Paint the enitre area including a portion of the painted area. Apply a
second coat a day later.

You'll be surprised at how the rust will creep under the paint. It looks
like fungus sometimes, with little feathery tendriles.
