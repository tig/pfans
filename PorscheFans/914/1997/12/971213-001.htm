Holiday greetings to everyone on this list. I'm Frank Miller, 48
(yikes!), live in Columbus OH with my wife, her daughter, a poodle, a
cat, and a garage full of cars. I also have a daughter, 16 and a son,
13, who I spend every other weekend in Pittsburgh with. I sell/support
computer systems for a living (sales automation systems to be exact).
Prior to that, I served time in a various cubicles as an engineer for
GM. I am also newsletter editor for our local PCA region (Mid-Ohio).

I bought my first 914 ('74 1.8) in 1980 for $2100 from a guy who was
getting a divorce.. At that time, that was about $1000 below loan value.
It had no heat, very poor brakes, and ran bad until you got up to around
75MPH, which is no place to be when your brakes are bad. I had owned VW
Bugs before, so I kind of knew what it needed, but I was not ready for
the sticker shock when I went to buy the parts I needed at the Porsche
counter rather than the VW counter (heat exchangers, muffler, front
brake calipers, and airflow). At least the parts guy was honest enough
to tell me to go buy the aftermarket ss heat exchangers rather than the
mild steel OEM's. Sure wish this group had been around back then!

I still have that 914, but a couple of years ago it fell victim of
shipwright's disease, when I knocked out the windshield to replace it,
found a little rust, and chased it down to the point where it is now
sitting as a garage queen waiting a little application of the MIG with
no bumpers, hood, headlight buckets, door jambs, windshield, rear
window, trunk hinges, etc, etc..

Last summer I happened to see another 914 ('73 1.7) for sale really
cheap, and although I really didn't need it, I ended up buying it for
parts. (My philosophy: you never can have too many 914's!) The battery
was sitting on a block of wood on top of the engine, so I knew without
looking too hard what condition the rest of the body was in, but the
doors, trunk and hood were free of rust, so that's all I took it for. As
I got to tearing it apart, I changed my mind and decided to try my hand
at reconstruction surgery. What the heck, they aren't building them
anymore, some day they may appreciate to the point where I might regret
getting rid it. (That's the problem with coming from Depression-era
parents, we get rid of nothing that someone might want someday). Hope my
kids appreciate what I'm doing for them. So I have a stack of sheetmetal
parts, the car body's on blocks and the engine is out of the way, and a
big pile of rusty crud is on the floor where I have been knocking out
pieces of rocker panel and suspension console (right side, of course).
Another project awaiting the MIG, too. So I'm making all my mistakes on
the '73 in preparation for finishing the '74.

Thanks to every one who keeps this list alive. I have really learned a
lot from the collective knowledge on this list. 

Happy Holidays!

Frank Miller
