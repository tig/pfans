I haven't seen this book talked about on the list, but me and the wife were
at Sam's Club today and spotted a very nice Porsche book titled; Porsche:
The Fine Art of the Sportscar.  This book is large (coffee table size) and
has approx. 335 pages with full color photos on every page (except some
with old racing photos).  From what I've seen of other books, this thing
should go for a good bit of cash, but we got it for $24.99.  It has the
obligitory 5-6 page 914 section, but is packed with every other car Porsche
ever got there fingers into.

Like I said, it's a coffe table book, but has VERY good photography.  I'd
recommend it to anyone.

Later,

Dion
