When the fees and smog check were due on my '73 in November, I paid the
fees, but parked the car until I had a chance to do some tuning in
preparation for the smog check.  Since our knowledge of the law was
unclear, and since it was so close to 1998, my son went to the DMV to
ask the above questions.

They answered by giving him the '98 sticker.

Cheers,
