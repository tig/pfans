914ers,

While sitting here on a vacation day, I got the urge to tear apart a
transmission.  Before you think I'm nuts, this is probably something that
would need to be done anyway.  My 1st gear synchros are gone, and the
second gear crunches when engaged.  Besides, four years ago when I
purchased the car, the guy threw in an extra sideshifter and tailshifter.
So I'm tearing apart the extra sideshifter.

I have the rear cover off as well as the side support.  I also have the
1st/reverse shift fork and gear removed.  Now I need to go buy a big socket
to take the expansion bolt out.  I think it's 28-29mm.

So far, the first gear sychros look pretty good.  This surprises me as the
rest of the outside of the tranny looks like it's about 50 years old, not
to mention the throwout bearing was frozen to the drive shaft!  As a matter
of fact, from what I can see inside, all of the gears look to be in very
good shape.  But, I'm still going to rebuild it anyway (at least seals and
gaskets).

Does anyone have any 'gotchas' to look out for before I screw something up?
 Any advice from someone who has been down this path before?  Hey, I
figured the last engine rebuild went very well, now it's time to rebuild a
tranny  :).

Thanks,

Dion
