Mr. Bill,

You could check out some of the ready-made stuff at your local RV store;
what I found with those (BlueOx etc.) was that they were huge and could
not be easily broken down (if at all). Main issue is finding one with
enough of a drop to clear your front valence (most are set up to pull
via the towee's bumper), so you can pull via brackets bolted/welded
under your spare.

Solution:

Lee Houseman
H & H Specialties
20 Reid Rd.
Chelmsford, MA  01824
508.256.9465

FYI, when Lee says his Carrera stabilizer bar business is really taking
off, he means bathtubs, not 911s. His tow bars were designed for 356s,
early 911s and 914s. H & H is definitely an old-school fab shop. 

The tow bar is about $250 + shipping, and is made of edge bent steel,
3/8" by 2 1/2", painted flat black. Bar is fully collapsible (you can
store it in a bag), goes together with bolts and nuts, all provided.
Uses a Fulton class 2 coupler (2" ball). Has two approx. 30 degree
angles in it, so clears your valence. You install brackets (provided)
under your spare (I run 205/50s on stock rims and leave them attached
all the time, don't drag them very often), and the bar hooks up via
clevis pins.

FWIW, there are at least three of us who use this bar regularly on the
list, and Doc. 914 of AutoAtlanta recommends it as well. Both my wife
and I've towed 500 mile stints at 65 mph, no problem.

I don't live near, nor have I ever met Lee at H & H etc. Just a really
satisfied customer.

Cheers!
