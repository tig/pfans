Please don't drown in your caustic humor.  Or is it just pure unbridled
cynicism?

I'm certainly no Polyanna, but I see you have had some unpleasant
employment experiences of your own, and you may lack well-rounded viewing
of the whole working public.

Be careful how you throw stones, whether about one's economic /
educational level, or about one's truthfulness!  Several of the underpaid
mechanic-types I speak of are on this list, and they do love what they
do.  I am impressed by your credentials, as I'm sure everyone else is
too, and I'm glad you own a Porsche for "how successful people think of
you" reasons.  That's certainly A reason to own one, but not the only
one.

Sticking to the original subject;
I maintain that I could show you many minimum-wage technicians who would
properly change your oil (properly torquing the drain plug) who love
their jobs, while at the same time showing you technicians who make
upwards of $20/hr. and don't care a whit about their customers.  Per the
original point, dollars-per-hour is not a true indicator about whether a
job (proper torque of drain plug bolts) will be done correctly on your
prized 914.  What language technicians speak, what their  neighborhood
rents are, and what level of education they have attained forces the
conversation into hyper-prejudice and also forces the thread to have to
move to the flamer's column if it continues along those veins.

When you've completed your master's thesis, let us all know when the
graduation ceremony will be and we will toss you some more accolades for
a job well done.

sure I don't that's why I'm working on  my masters degree. HELL I might

those 
people who weren't motivated enough to finish college.

do these guys have a high school education, English speaking?

how much is the rent in that area , 200- 250 a month maybe less

lastly why do you own a Porsche? if you say it has nothing to do with how
you 
want people to think of you a.k.a. how successful people think you are
