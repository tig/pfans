This is an interesting point and does indeed have merit. However the
above example of B-Stock (aka Miata spec class) at Nationals is not
terribly indicative. Only a 2.3 second margin separated the top trophy
from the bottom (16th) trophy. That's a little over one tenth of a
second per trophy.

Anyway, I was talking with some SSB (miata) road racers and they said
that the 185/60-14 tire was good for faster lap times at high speed
tracks than teh 205/55-14 that they would normally run on. The reason?
They belive lesser rolling resistance. Hmm, could be. But then look at
the CSP results for Nationals, and the winning car, a _miata_ (ack) was
on 245/45-16 tires! So maybe it's just an annomoly, or maybe wider tires
really are faster. :)

But it is worth some thought. I know that the 225/50-14 tire is _heavy_.
That's what I'm running now, and I could launch the car a whole lot
better on the 205/50-15 than I can with this heavy wheel/tire combo.
