>>           John informed me that the shift linkage between fire

	As far as I know, the tranny mounts are identical.  In fact, the
only real change is that the font of the (longer) engine sits farther
forward.  That's one of the reasons that you don't use the firewall pad
in the engine compartment of a Six.  Next to no space between the fan and
the firewall; you don't want any of it taken away for anything!
	You have many choices of engine mounts.  Some of them replace the
Four's mounting bar with another crossbar.  You may be able to use either
the tailshifter shift rods or the sideshifter with these.  I do know one
person with a 74 4->6 that used his stock sideshifter, but he cut the ends
off of the rear shift rod (the one with the bends in it) and welded a
straight rod in the middle.  He says it shifts better than ANY 914 he's
ever driven--side-shifter, tail-shifter, factory Six, anything.
	If you use the factory-style centermount, you can use any shift
linkage that fits the tranny.

	Someone can (and I'm sure will) correct me if I'm wrong on this,
but I'm pretty sure that you don't have to hack the linkage when you put
a Six in.  Unless you try putting a 915 tranny in...  (Sounds VERY scary.)
