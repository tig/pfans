OK, maybe someone here knows this. I posted a message to the 911
porschefans, but I haven't recieved an answer yet. I'm wondering about the
rear suspension. On our wonderful cars, the rear suspension is adjustable
for toe and camber from the factory, and can be adapted for ride height very
easily. Does the 911 rear suspension have the same capability for
adjustment? I mean the old, original type 911 suspension, not the newer
Weissach rear end. I know there are adjustable spring plates on the later
911's, but what about the original ones? The 60's to early 70's ones that
are more likely to be affordable?

Why would I be concerned about this? (no, I'm not suffering from "small man"
syndrome and hoping to "one up" the 911 people - I am 6'3" and 220lbs, after
all). I still have a hankering for another Porsche, the 2002 just doesn't
cut it (but it is what I can afford right now). So, my mind drifts around
thinking of maybe owning an old 911 or 912 or maybe another 914. Hence, my
interest in comparing the adjustability of the two designs.
