NO ! Its a body Kit that Chuck Beck made up because he didnt want to pay
for GT flares years ago. It's a remove the bumpers (great for a 75 car)
and bolt it on, it goes across the front with bult in bummper and then
up the side to almost the doors, same with rear. Its either you like it
or hate it, I used to hate it, but after seeing it for so long, guess it
grew on me. Guess you would have to see it. I have a Picture of Randys
cars with Body kit and 9's and 10's Fuchs, if Someone wants to scan it
I'll sent it
 Don
