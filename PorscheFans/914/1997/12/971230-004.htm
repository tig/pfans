No way dude, this won't work. Well, the motor will *function*, but it'll be
much less than optimum. One reason is that the larger throttle body will
alter the manifold vacuum at part throttle from the oem setup. Also, the
throttle switch may not be the same, altering the enrichment function. The
oem throttle switch may not attach to the larger throttle body. The OEM
Djet setup is calibrated for the stock displacment, vacuum, ignition
timing, and cam timing. Altering any of these (and maybe other things as
well) will change the mixture from the original. While the calibration can
be changed, the only way to do it is to use the "black box" approach, which
is hokey if you ask me.
