Hi Dirk!

   You asked:

   Another brand name for the same thing is "Nutsert".   These can be
had at most home improvement stores in the hardware section, and come
with a cheapie installation tool and 5 or 6 nutserts for about 6 or 7
dollars.   I got a set of the things from a local tool specialist; it
came in a plastic box with four nutsert tools and some small supplies
of each size of nutsert.   The company that makes them is located
about 30 or 40 miles from where I live; here is the address:

	AVK Industrial Products
	25323 Rye Canyon Road
	Valencia,  CA.  91355
	Phone:  (805) 257-2329

   They won't sell directly to you (I know, I've tried), but they
will provide you with the names and addresses of local distributors
in your area, or the closest to you, at any rate.

   Hope this is of some help.

                                                            Jim T.
