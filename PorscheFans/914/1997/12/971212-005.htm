Hi, my name is Garold Shaffer I am 31yrs old (32 on the 18th) live
Portage Indiana
and work in Schaumburg IL (yes a 75 mile commute, oneway) for Motorola.

This is my 914 story....... I always wanted a 911. I never thought
anything
about a 914 until one day on my commute home traffic on the Tri-State
(aka 294) was at a stand still. So I finally made my way to a exit and
decided
to get off 294 and take some back roads home. Thats when it happen......

I seen my 914 in a front yard with a forsale sign. I stopped talk to the
PO
drove the car and went home (I was hooked). The next day I called and
made
a offer that PO took. Now I have the car (a 73 2.0L) sitting in my
garage and
it hits me. I just bought a car that I know nothing about, the panic
sets in,
all I can see is $$$$ for repairs and such (I am by far no mechanic).

The first thing I did was take the 914 to a local VW/Porsche dealer to
have it
checked out. They said it was one of the better 914s they have seen.
No major rust, just under the battery tray but everything else looked
good.
Compression was a little low but it ran ok. I have had my 914 for 1 1/2
years
and have replace the front and rear swaybar bushings, new boge shocks &
110 lb springs, front wheel bearings, and a new rebuilt motor with dual
carbs
that is going to be converted back FI.

I would like to close with saying thanks to everyone on the list and on
the many
914 web pages. And a speical thanks to Brad Mayeur for all his help with
my
little 914 project.

Happy Holidays!

Garold
