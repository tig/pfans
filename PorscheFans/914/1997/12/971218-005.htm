	The window stuff can be done a few ways.  The easiest in
terms of labor, and probably the most expensive in terms of parts,
is to put 73+ doors on the car.  You may be able to put new-style
regulators into the old-style doors, I don't know.
	Hmm, the striker plate *did* change a bit through the years,
but I don't know if the mating part on the door did or not.  But if
you have both early and late doors, you should be able to work that
out.
	The 72 *does* have a moving passenger seat.  To convert the
70-71 models, you will at least need the seat and rails, and you
may very well have to weld attatchments for the new rails (etc.)
onto the floor pan.  You will also have to change the firewall pad
to the later style.
	Speaking of firewall pads, you have to use the 73+ style (I
think) to fit the retracting seatbelts.  A friend with a 72 told me
that 72s didn't originally have the retracting belts, but that you
can bolt them right in if you get the later firewall pad.

	I think the most important upgrade would be the tranny.
Which also means the engine mounts, the shift linkage, even the
gearshift lever.
