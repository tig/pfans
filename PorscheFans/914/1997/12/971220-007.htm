Well, the tweek that I've heard works great on CIS cars is a rising rate
fuel pressure regulator. The problem with CIS is a distinct lack of
throttle response. There appears to not be any "accelerator pump" effect
that you get from carbs. The vacuum-actuated fuel pressure regulator seems
to help that system to have decent throttle response. I still like
mechanical fuel injection, though better than any electronic one. Too bad
it would be sooo hard to put that on the 4 cylinder motors. You'd need a
bunch of custom parts to do it.
