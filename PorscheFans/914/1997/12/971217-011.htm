OK, here's the deal with the 6 cyl. conversion to make you feel better
about the $5K rebuild. BTW: DON'T ask me *how* I know....

- A 3.0L long block - ~$4K - 5K
- Engine rebuild - $2.5K - $4K (parts) depending on the *unknown*
condition of the long block you spend spent your inheritance on or
emptied your 401K plan for.
- Carb conversion (used - if you can find one) - ~1K
- OEM Oil Tank - $500
- Oil Lines - $300
- Engine mounts - ~$300 - 500
- Transmission shift extension - ~$200
- Headers/exhaust (remember, a 911 exhaust points in the *wrong*
direction) - ~1.2K
- Plan on at least another $1K - 2K for stuff that I've forgotten.

And after you get the power *inside* the car, you'll have to start
worrying about how to get it all to the ground (suspension, shocks,
chassis stiffeners, wheels, tires, etc.) And even more importantly, how
you're going to *stop* the beast *after* you get all that power to the
ground (brakes, rotors, master cyl., etc...)

Hey $5K is looking pretty good, eh?

BTW: I assume you'll be doing all the work yourself - there isn't any
fluff in those numbers to pay someone else to do the work.... Or, just
send me your car, a mastercard with no preset spending limit and I
should have it ready for you in about a year or so. You pay shipping
(grin)
