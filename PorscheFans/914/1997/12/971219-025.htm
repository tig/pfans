First came carbs on the very early 911. MFI then became commonly
available in '69 on the 911E (nice car). MFI is essentially six
individual throttle bodies (one for each cylinder) and six injection
lines. The really tricky part is that is has this fancy fuel pump that
is attached directly to the throttle linkage. The more you open the
throttle the more gas the pump puts out. It does not monitor anything
else. Foot=Gas, and the air just comes along for the ride. That's why
it's finiky, it needs to synched just like carbs. But the thottle
response in nearly instantaneous. Then came CIS (K-Jetronic) in the
second half of the '73 model year. It was a hardwired brain tha ran a
fuel pump, similar in nature to the MFI. But it monitored incoming air
through a flapper plate (its ancestor is the L-Jet) through a single
larger throttle body, and controlled the fuel pump electronically from
the ECU. All in all, CIS is do-nothing-wrong system. Just update the
intake box with a pop-off valve (they're cheap), as some people have
experinced large amounts of backpressure in the intake system and blown
open their intake boxes. I don't know how, this is just what I've heard.
