I missed the beginning of this - have you checked your alternator and
voltage regulator yet? Most of the auto parts stores here will do a free
test of the charging system in the car for you (gotta wait for a dry day,
though). I would'nt write off the gauge yet, even tho they usually arent
very accurate.
For somthing to heat up enough to pull down the voltage of a properly
operating charging system, something's got to be getting pretty hot!
