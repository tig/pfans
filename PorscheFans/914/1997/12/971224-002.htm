Season's greetings p-nuts,

Hey, I'm in need of some coaching from somebody here...
I have two separate problems going on with my '74 2.0ltr

1. Front Brakes
I have a new set of pads in front (from GPR) that I put in, with lots of
"anti-squeal" compound on the backs of them.  All I did here was change the
pads and now the car sounds like a frigging volvo with the annoying squeal
that I'm getting.  Squeal sorta goes away as the brakes get warmer...
QUESTIONS:
- the rotors are in good shape, I did NOT bother to turn them ..could this
be the problem?
- suppose I'm using too hard a brake pad? (these are supposed to be
agressive street compound pads)
- My pedal pressure isn't the world's firmest...suppose bleeding the system
will help?
- any other things I can check (or do)?

2. Valves
I've been adjusting the valves according to the settings in the manual
(.008  exhaust and .006 intake?)
and I get a small, gurgling backfire between shifts...I'm not convinced I'm
doing everything right here.
QUESTIONS:
- Starting with #1 TDC, I've rotated the engine counter-clockwise to get
1,2,3,4 in order...watching the distributor rotor move exactly 90 degrees
to the next piston for TDC...this IS the correct sequence isn't it?
- Intake valves are towards the INSIDE of the head, right?
- is this gurgling backfire symptomatic of too-tight valves or too loose?
- Anything else I could check? I really don't want to yank the engine just
yet, although I do need to put another clutch in it pretty soon...

anyone?

Thanks and Merry Christmas to all
Thom Kuby
