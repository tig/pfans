When I ran the 205/50s they were BFG TAs with a V rating. I ran them on
aftermarket spoked minilite look a likes that had pretty close to stock
offset. Of course the rear fender lip had been rolled a little but they
had plenty of clearance.

I had no clearance problems on either side. A friend of mine ran the same
tire on the Riviera rims.

You can't have it both ways. If you don't like 3400-3500 rpm then go with
the 60 series. If I were you, I'd go with the 195s because they aren't
more than a 1/4 inch narrower and we all know they will fit.
