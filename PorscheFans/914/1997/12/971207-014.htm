PFans,

O.K., here goes my story.  Going on four years ago I started to get the
itch for a fun little sportscar.  At the time, I was driving a 91 Chrysler
LeBaron Convertible and was very happy with it, but missed shifting gears.
It was the only automatic I had ever owned, and was bored with it.  I was
also brought up working on cars and restoring hotrods and streetrods, so
the need for something to work on was getting to me.  My last tinkering car
was a 1976 VW Convertible Bug, and I got to know the boxer engine very well
while owning that car.  

I also had the urge to get into autocrossing.  At the time, I lived with a
guy who loved racing, and we spent all the time we could at Mid-Ohio,
Watkins Glen, Daytona, etc.  Plus, my Uncle in Florida was zipping around
the cones in a 1st gen RX-7 and telling me how much fun it was.  So I
started to casually look through the classifieds and in local 'auto trader'
rags.  One day, I stopped at the local newstand and picked up a copy of
Hemmings Motor news.  Probably not the place to look for old Porsches, but
I really didn't know what I was looking for.  I spotted a 1972 914 for sale
for $1800, and it happened to be located about 15 minutes from me.  I
couldn't resist.

Many of you know the history of the car from there.  I won't bore anyone
with the details, but let's just say I've probably taken apart or replaced
just about every component on the car and done all of the work myself.  It
was 3 years before I ever really drove the car, and there were times when I
was ready to get rid of it.  But the combination of this list, my new Wife
keeping the drive going, and my first autocross in it was enough to have me
hooked for life.  By the way, my first autocross was 2 weeks after I got
the thing on the road, fresh engine and all.

I have a lot of Dirk's disease; start doing one thing and the next thing
you know, the engine is all over the floor in thousands of pieces.  But it
has been an experience that has helped me beyond just learning what part
goes where.  Once again, thank you list members for the great advice,
bargain parts, and a lots of friends I've made along the way.

The car is continually being taken to a new level, and hopefully I can get
it competitive in AP one of these days.  Some say this is an impossible
task (with the Tigers, Elan's and RX-7's out there), but wouldn't it be fun
to see a 914 finish somewhere in the standings of the SCCA Nationals?
Oneday...

Take Care,

Dion
