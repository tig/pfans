You shouldn't need to drop the motor, but you will need to pull your
heat exchangers off.  Once they're off, you'll need to pull the valve
covers as well.  Now, this could get a little tricky.  I haven't done
this with the motor in the car, so I'm speculating here, but most of it
should apply.  Grab a towel and some vice grips, wrap the towel around
the tube, gently clamp the vice grips on, and tug.  If all goes well,
the front of the push rod will be exposed under the rocker assembly, and
the back will be exposed under the head.  The problem that I see is that
the pushrod will prevent you from getting the new seal onto the pushrod
at then end where it enters the case.  You might be able to slide it
past the end of the pushrod by rotating the engine until there's
freeplay, but I doubt it.  Chances are you'll need to either looses your
valve adjusters a lot, or completely remove the rocker assemblies.  Both
of these should be feasible with the engine in the car, but reassembly
will be a PITA.  Once you get the old seals off, clean everything up as
good as you can, and reassemble with Viton pushrod tube seals.  So far,
Viton (available from German Parts and Restoration and many other
places) have been the only seals that have been reliable on our motors.
I'd use just a little dab of motor oil wiped around the seals before
reinstalling the tube.  Based on everything that I've heard so far, the
key to getting pushrod tubes to seal has been the use of Viton seals.
Since I've switched, I haven't leaked a drop.  Since this procedure has
the ability to get very complicated very quickly, you might want to
consider going half-way with an engine drop.  If you disconnect just
some of the wires in the engine compartment, the shift linkage, clutch
cable, and speedometer cable, you should be able to drop the motor
straight down with the car in the air.  Since you won't be pulling the
motor out the back, you won't need to remove all of the injection
components from the engine for clearance.  Once the motor is on the
floor, you can easily work on the rocker assemblies and pushrod tubes
without visibility issues.

Hope this helps!
