A buddy of mine went Gene Berg crazy last summer.  73 VW bug with 2110cc =
Dual 42 webers, ported n polished heads, 78mm crank, 90.5mm jugs.  When =
I rode int it I couldn't believe how fast it was.  Runs 14.5 in the =
quarter mile.  I can't say enough good stuff about the Berg stuff.  Too =
bad Gene Berg passed away about a year ago.  His sons are keeping the =
place going thou.

Yeah,

  Automobile Atlanta has a 5 lug conversion package, and I think it is
somewhere between 1000 and 1500 dollars.  It includes rotors, brake pads, and
everything you need, less the 5 lug rims.  So, if you are going to do it, it
would be finacially beneficial to do it when you need a brake job, that way
you are not replacing parts that dont need to be replaced anyway ( who would
want to throw away a good set of pads or rotors?)
     But that is pretty expensive, and I dont think its worth it cause you
wont get the money back when you sell the car.  If the reason you want to do
it is for a wider selection of better rims, I suggest you look in a VW mag
like VW TRENDS, because in the advertising section, I have seen that they have
really nice 5 star 4 lug rims for like 110 a piece.  They also have  914 2.0
alloys for 85 a piece. 

good luck
