	I think you're missing the point.  Most of the people I know who have
done the five-lug conversion process have done it in search of BRAKES.  If you
have ever driven a 911 (particularly 78 911SC or later), you will believe in
BRAKES.
	Of course, just about everyone I know who has done the conversion is
an avid autoXer/Time Trialer, so big brakes are pretty important to them.  I
do know some that have done the five-bolt because they want the 914-6 look,
and some who have done it because they want a greater selection of real
Porsche rims (whatever that means).
	If all you want is a five-spoke wheel, the best bet is to find a nice
looking one that has the correct four-bolt pattern.  But, if you want bigger
brakes, or Fuchs windmills (or real cookie cutters, or whatever), then you
need to go to the real five-bolt setup.

	Remember that these are *cast* replicas of a *forged* wheel.  Cast
aluminum and forged aluminum are not identical in strength (not in every way)
and the design was originally for the forged stuff.  The cast wheels are
probably not quite as strong.  This can be important if you're going to race,
or put very low-profile tires on it and drive over potholes...
	I know two different people (me and another list member) who have had
problems with the Fuchs replicas not releasing from the front hub.  In fact,
I had this happen (same set of wheels) to both of my cars.  In all three
cases, the right-front wheel was the one that stayed on the hub.  In one case
the rim came off with lots of HARD kicks.  In one case, the lug nuts were
loosened (just a little!!) and the car driven.  And in the third, a BIG dead-
blow hammer was used.
	As always, YMMV.
