Greg,

I'm not an expert on this, but from what I've heard, repo seals are
hit and miss - and that was the case for me. 

I used repo seals (AA) for the top side seals and don't like the results -
they're a little thicker so the windows don't roll up all the way without
opening the door first (I know the windows is adjustable but that would
throw clearances off on front and back window seals), and the top doesn't
store in the rear trunk without real effort due to extra thickness
(and now the increased tension caused the rubber holders to break).
Maybe this fit is due to variances in these hand-made cars, who knows...
But now I have to buy the OEM seals to get it right.

I chose an OEM top front seal as I knew this one to be critical and
did not want to take a chance with fit (not yet installed - waiting on
paint).

I'd go for the OEM seals around the top and windows, except maybe a repo
on the top rear seal. I might take a chance on that one since it's way
expensive and it doesn't seem as critical - but I haven't seen a repo offered.

Anyone looked at the JC Witney catalog for rubber that could be used for
the top rear seal?
