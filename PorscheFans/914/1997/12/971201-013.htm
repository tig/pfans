Dirk,

Yes all three (toe/camber/height) are adjustable on the original 911
trailing arm suspensions.  Easily?...well, that's in the eye of the
beholder, I suppose.

Without adjustable spring plates, the only way to modify height is to
disassemble the spring plates and raise/lower them on the T-Bar splines.
Since the T-Bar inner splines and outer splines have different counts,
you can adjust at both ends (up one, down the other) to get finer dgrees
of adjustment.  The details are in the Haynes manual...if memory serves,
2.5 degtrees is the minimum height adjustment, either way.

Toe and camber are controlled by two eccentric bolts which attach the
spring plate to the trailing arm.  Understanding the mechanics of these
two bolts isn't what I'd call "easy", but by turning them and watching
the rear hub move, you can get a pretty good idea of what's happening;
example: as the spring plate rises up on the trailing arm (while
adjusting the eccentric bolt by turning it), you can see the top of the
brake rotor tip in - ie. more negative camber.

It takes a little getting used to; and in my case years ago,
assembling/disassembling the rear suspension three or four times before
I had it down pat.  Again, Haynes has the details.

Hope the gargantuan multiple post ends soon...my delete finger is
starting to get carble tunnels syndrom!
