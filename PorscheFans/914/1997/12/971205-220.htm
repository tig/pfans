To all Dutchies on the list (and I know you are out there somewhere…),

I'm looking for some (first hand) info or experiences with Dutch Porsche
Clubs. Our P-family on the other side of the big ocean seem to have a lot
more fun than we do overhere (driver's ed., club-racing, autocrossing
etc.). I've visited the PCA Northstern region last summer and they had tons
of fun at the track! They really got me jealous and I wanna get some
track-fun too… after all, the way the police is checking now a days it's
not much fun on the public roads anymore (been to court for a speeding
ticket earlier this year and I can tell you it's definitely NOT funny –
driving 110km (or  70mi) to fast). Our once-a-year day at the
Zandvoort-track organized by Pon (the Dutch P-importer) is usually
overcrowded (over 100 cars) and I wasn't much impressed by snobs cruising
their brand new cars along the track while using their mobile phones either
(look mom, no hands… look mom, no brains!).
So, does any of you cheeseheads on this list know of a club where I can get
me some real adrenaline-rushes (there must be something else to do with our
Porsches than cruising along the wind mills on Sunday afternoon 8^)?

Let me know if you know…

Yes, it seems it's true that here in cyber 914land we talk alot about 2.0
Liters, but there are a lot of us 1.8 owners lurking and solving our own
problems as well. Congratulations to our new friend and 1.8 owner! 
My 75 1.8 may be one of the lowest of the often low powered 4 cylinders, but
that doen't mean it doesn't provide plenty of fun. I've run this 160,000 mile
ugly duckling for about 15 months now and never once had to drive anything
else due to a breakdown. 
The books say that my car started with 76 ponies. So, how do I get the most
out of it? I've got a Pertronix Point Replacement, a Bursch exhaust,  Bosch
Platinum plugs and quality plug wires. My next investment (if I can pass
emissions following Saturdays tune up!) is a K&N filter. My engine seems to
have good compressions, no exhaust leaks and clean injectors. 
Any suggestions on how to get that little more and keep it reasonably stock
and reliable? This is not only my daily driver, it is my only vehicle.

Nick
