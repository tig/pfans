   My understanding is that aircraft engine practice is that as long
as the rings never leave the bore, you can move the jug around, and
even slide it out far enough to pull the gudgeon pin and remove the
piston and cylinder assembly from the rod to split the bottom end,
and still retain the rings.
   Once the rings leave the bore, however, they are throw-away items.
  The jug must be honed, and new rings installed.   Obviously, if
your cylinders are in as good a shape as you depict, only a light
honing, enough to "brake the glaze" is necessary, and should not
shorten cylinder life appreciably.

   Just my $.02.
