The way I see this, the Djet system is calibrated for a certain
relationship between the throttle position and the vacuum. The throttle
switch is for enrichment during acceleration, but I'm not referring to
that. There are certain assumptions built into the system that a larger
throttle body would upset. The change from full vacuum to a much lesser
vacuum during the travel of the throttle body from closed to fully open
would be different for the two throttle bodies. The larger one would cause
much less vacuum at full throttle, which may be out of the range of what
the MPS can accomodate, thus creating a lean condition at full throttle.
There are probably other anomolous things that could come up if the change
were made.
