Bill: since you really don't know  much about the motor or who built it,
let's go back to square one on this... Static Time the motor>>>  pull
the left valve cover & all the plugs, install a compression gage hose
(with the schrader valve removed) in the #1 plug... turn the engine til
you hear the air starting to push out on the comp stroke & watch the
valves to ascertain they are at about the tdc point... i find one can
turn the engine from below by using a long screwdriver thru the weep
hole below the flywheel... if you can put a whistle on the hose it works
best, but strangle it to a small orifice so you can hear or feel the
point where the air stops coming out.. this is very close to tdc... 

now go look at the marks on the fan.. if it has a genuine 2.0 fan you
should be able to find the tdc mark with a mirror & bright flashlite..
it is in such a position on the back side that you can't see it
otherwise.. use a fine brush to paint a mark at tdc on the front side of
the fan or on a fin near the tdc mark.. (if it has a non-2.0 fan the
marks may be in the wrong place.. i've seen this problem several times)

with the tdc mark centered on the notch or case centerline, look at
where the distributor rotor is pointing.. it should be aimed sort of
toward the steering wheel, close to a small notch on the edge of the
distr body.. if it ain't pointing there, your engine builder put it
together wrong..

if you are using points, turn on the ign, rotate the dist clockwise in
dir of rotat'n until you see that the points are closed.. using a test
light helps a lot here (it will go out when the points close)..  then
rotate the dist ccw until the points just open (lite comes on)  secure
the dist in this position & the car will start.. you can fiddle more 
with the timing later, after the rest of the adjustments are sorted
out..

yep, i'm about 13miles from Cool, uphill
