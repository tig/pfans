Replacing engine bearings and rod bearings is the cheapest part of the
rebuild. I would never assume anything about a used motor I bought. Also, if
the motor spins a bearing in a mag case, the case is usually trash. Do you
want to risk that? See the latest european car for a picture of what a spun
911 main bearing looks like. The owner had only done upper (outer?) engine
rebuilds and neglected the bottom end.

If it was me, I would bolt the engine up to a tranny with a starter, and
spin the motor to get an idea of what kind of compression the engine has.
What do you know about the motor from the PO?

also whats the general feeling on the need for an

I can't help you there. I assume the stock cooler is adequate for street
use. The bigger issue is getting a tank at a reasonable price. For the cost
that these are going for, you could probably get a custom tank built out of
stainless steel.
