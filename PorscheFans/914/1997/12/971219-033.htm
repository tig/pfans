Hi Chris.

I had a bunch of problems (read: the brakes felt awful no matter what I
did) with the stock prop valve, which I did NOT attempt to adjust.
Eventually I switched to a Wilwood / Summit unit that I bought as a kit
from George Wright (see email below), and since then my brakes have been
GREAT. At Laguna Seca, I actually had brakes for the first time since I
started Time Trialing.

If George is no longer making the kits, you can put one together with a
valve from Summit, some  rigid metric brake line assemblies, some
metric-to-SAE brake flare adapters, a metric brake line "T", a homemade
bracket and some hardware so that it screws in where the original unit went
and holds the valve and "T".

Summit Racing has an 800 (or 888) number. Their selection of metric stuff
is limited, however.

HTH,
