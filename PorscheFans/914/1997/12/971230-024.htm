Actually, the ideal tappet has the same hardness as your cam -- no more,
and no less. This may be why some aftermarket cam folks sell (& warranty)
their cams only when used with their (new) lifters.

A cam grinder whose opinion I respect had the following to say about
breaking in cams and lifters (his expertise is American V8s, but I believe
it applies here, too): Lube everything well during assembly, the fire it
right up and run the engine at 2,000 rpm for 10-20 minutes (no synthetic
oil!), and then stop worrying about it.  You'll still need to seat the
rings, but the cam and lifters are OK now. In those first minutes the cam
and lifter will wear against each other to a state that they're both happy
with, and will happily live ever after, assuming you have decent clean oil.

Just my $.02.
