  ...and Gary Helbig replied:

"      To the best of my knowledge, there's no such thing as
"factory" AC.  It
was all dealer installed.    "   

       This is my understanding also.

"   The condensor was mounted in the front trunk where the spare tire
used
to be.    "  

     Correct.

"      (The spare was moved to the back trunk.)    "   

 No.... in my case (VPC air conditioning) the spare was mounted to a
bar above the condenser, which raised it about 8 inches, effectively
destroying the luggage-carrying capacity of the front trunk.

"    You really don't want to duplicate this; it involves removing
the floor
of the front trunk.     "     

 True... and the airflow through the condenser is poor anyway, as the
condenser face is virtually parallel to the air stream, and includes
an air dam about 1/3 of the way along to force the air up into the
condenser housing, and then back down through the condenser
itself....  an extremely mickey-mouse arrangement, IMHO. 

"      Goodness knows what structural problems result.      "   

 I haven't run into anything that could be construed as a structrual
problem because of the huge hole in the trunk floor, but I don't
auto-x the car either, and run stock tires, so the stresses on the
front of my car are probably not large enough to show up any
weakness.  I do have a replacement trunk floor piece that John Lush
was kind enough to sell me, and eventually, I will plug up the
hole... I'll let the list know if there's any noticable difference.
