	I think it is much better.  I, too, was disappointed with the "How
to Tune and Modify..." book, and I much prefer the Probst book.
	It is a very readable book, and contains a lot of information on
the various FI systems.  It relegates the D-jet system to a small appendix
to the L-jet system, so the D-jet info isn't as coherent as the info for
the other systems.  If you have a 1.7 or 2.0 with stock FI, keep that in
mind.
	It is also *not* a specific guide to how to fix your 914's FI
system.  What it has is a lot of general theory, principles of operation,
and descriptions of what individual *types* of components do.  It won't,
for instance, tell you what the resistance of the Head Temp Sensor should
be when the engine is cold.  However, it will tell you *how* an Aux Air
Valve works.

	"Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management", by [forget the first
name] Probst, published by Bentley Books.  A good book, one that is worth-
while to have.
