The traffic is low today for some reason, so I'll jump in despite my
limited experience.

I strongly suspect the pad compound. And the short answer is you may
have to learn to live with some noise. I tried an early (orange) version
of the carbon pads on my 914 a few years ago and loved them at the
track, but very quickly decided to swap them out for the street. Try all
the tricks first, like champfering the leading edge, cleaning the
caliper surface that the pads slide on and lightly greasing the metal
backing plate where they touch the caliper, etc. but you will probably
have to experiment with other pads until you find the performance/noise
compination that works for you.  Have you tried the Hawk HPS pads? They
were pretty quiet on my C2, but still noiser than stock.
