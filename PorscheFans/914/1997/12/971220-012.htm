OK guys...........Help me out, if you don't mind, I need some feedback.  This
posting is directed to those of the list that have done the conversion on the
914-4s and for those thinking about it.
For those of you that know me, you know I like 914s with the classic Porsche
five spoke Fuchs.  I also feel our stock 914s brakes could be better.  Those
two things are probably major contributers for many of us doing the
conversion.  
Since I've been 914ing (and I'm sure a lot longer) the options for front 5 lug
conversions were: Drill existing hubs and insert studs, Install adapters or
Use a 911 strut setup.  Each process has its strengths and weaknesses.  Hub
drilling is OK, but when the front rotors wear thin they have to be replaced
and done again.  Spacers don't work well on stock bodied cars and the quality
of some of these pieces are not up to most of our standards.  Complexity for
us do-it-yourselfers and high cost keep many from doing the 911 stuts.

Question 1 - Do you think there interrest for a reasonably priced 5 lug
conversion kit for the existing front 914-4 strut?

Question 2 - What drawbacks are there to the idea?

Question 3 - Would used parts (brake pads and bearings excluded) in good
condition be a problem?

Technical Details: Kit would have 911 vented rotors, aluminum hubs, large
caliper (54 mm piston set and almost turbo size brake pads).  Other than a
dust seal collar (good for a couple hundred years or so) none of the parts
would be custom which means servicability would be easy.

All comments and ideas welcome.

Happy holidays...........Rich
