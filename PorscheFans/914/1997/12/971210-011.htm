I have also heard much about POR-15, but have no experience with the
product.  Look in all the 914 catalogs, its in there.

I've been using a product called "Extend" since I was a teenager.  Depending
on the part, a good wire brush is all I've used to clean surfaces.  For
example, I coated both the steering rack cover and the pedal assembly base
the last time they were out.  For painted surfaces, I have used Extend as an
undercoat under the primer.
