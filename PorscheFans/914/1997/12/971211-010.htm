	Jim Branch, 
	My dad had the same symptoms, more or less, in his 356. Started
ok, ran strong, stopped suddenly. Leave it a while and it starts again.
By now everyone has guessed- FUEL STARVATION! His fuel filter was full
of GAH. New fuel filter and away he went. Have you changed your filter?

	Someone was wondering about chokes and FI- a choke is a relativly
crude way to richen the mixture. The almost all mechanical K-Jet had a 
neat warm-up feature that did the same job- fuel pressure regulator was
mounted on the engine block with a little heater included for people
who live in Sweden or The Northwest Territories. Pressure regulator 
spring sat on a bimetalic base, so fuel pressure was high at starting
and dropped as the engine warmed up. And in cold climates, the little
heater would eventually warm it up and drop it even if heat from the
block never got there. 

	Which is a long way of saying, if you want a 'choke' effect in FI,
find a way to increase the fuel pressure. The D & L Jet injectors open a 
hole of fixed size for a variable amount of time. Increasing pressure will
richen the mix. This may not be a simple linear thing however, since the
turbulent flow through the injector may not increase linearly with pressure.
K-Jet was CIS, with variable-area slots opened or closed by the air flow
sensor. Simplest fuel-air system I've ever seen.
