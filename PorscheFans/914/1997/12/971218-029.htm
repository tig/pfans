<I was talking with my friendly mechanic yesterday re. bumping up the HP
on my 1.7 1972 lean green machine w/FI.  After listing a number of
things we could do to enhance the umphh of my engine, he laid an
estimated price of 5K on me!!

<After inhaling a sufficient quanity of smelling salts, I thought it
better to ask the experts.
    Is 5K reasonable?  (pistons, cam, headers, heat exchangers, etc.)

Well, if you want to take your car to the dealer, or one of the many
"specialty" shops who do micro-surgery on your wallet, yep 5K is
reasonable.

However, if you don't mind doing your own work you could easily get the
job done for 1k to 1.5k unless you plan to go to an aftermaket EFI
system, then add another 2k. BTW the type 4 motors are easy to work on.
Getting the whole engine/transmission assembly out of the car is easy too
(let us know if you plan to unzip the motor, we'll be glad to help you
over the weird stuff)

   < Would it be better to put that much $ into a 2.0L engine and
transmission?

Still too much money IMHO.

   < How about a 6 cyl. conversion and costs?

Looking at the prices folks are getting for their conversion pieces this
probably would cost a lot more than 5k, unless you are willing to do more
work yourself.

<Add to the 5K, a 2K paint job and initial cost and console and fog
lights and wheels and...
My little machine would be well above 12K.  Of course, what price love?

Nice little money pit, huh? Especially if you let your "mechanic friend"
do all the work.

<Thoughts would be appreciated.

You asked for it!!
