Really? You turne it over several times and no compression noises? what
about any resistance to turning when you're on the compression stroke? That
would be really bad since I know my little 4 cylinder is hard to turn
through the compression stroke, even when stone cold. 

Carrera tensions seem to be the normal upgrade path, but my gut hunch is
against them. Considering I have no direct experience with these things, it
seems to me a really bad idea to have several more oil lines running around
because of the increased chance of leaks. Also, the tension would change
with temperature, since the oil pressure does the same thing. I really like
the mechanical adjustsers. They are simple and cheap. However, i'm sure
you'd have to take the covers off occasionally to adjust them for wear. But
the interval may be in the 10s of thousands of miles, I don't really know. 

The oil squirters are a great idea. Also get the Raceware hardware. 

I think the next step is to do a compression test and check the valve guides. 

If you have low/no compression and worn valve guides, then you have no
choice but to completely disassemble the engine. 

Dark, sooty plugs means the motor was running too rich. This will dilute the
oil film on the cylinders and cause excessive wear there, as well as causing
bearing wear. You'll probably find lots of carbon deposits in the combustion
chamber and on the pistons when you take it apart. 

I think you need to get organized in the sense that when you do take the
motor apart, you need to keep all of the appropriate parts together, ie, #1
cylinder head, piston, jug, rod, etc all together.

Gimme a buzz after the holidays if you wanna turn wrenches.
