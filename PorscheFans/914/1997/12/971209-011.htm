Yeah, that's kinda what I figured.  I couldn't really see how a dead or
dying battery could affect spark magnitude, but I guess I'm back where I
started.  Now that I've ruled out the Aux. Air Valve, what could cause
both system voltage and spark magnitude to decrease as the engine warms
up?  Even if I chalk up the system voltage drop as a fluke in the gauge,
I've still got this weak spark problem...  Ack!

Thanks again,
