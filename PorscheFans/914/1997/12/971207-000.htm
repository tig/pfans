Hello 914er's and a Merry Christmas,
 
 I passed on this last year, because I didnt think I had anything to
say, well some of you know different by my once and awhile postings,
though Im not machanical, I'd like to think I have learned little over
the years and kinda know what Im talking about (yeah right!)

Almost forgot, My name is Don Haney, 33yrs, and I live in Upland Ca, 
with my wife and 3 yrs old son (I swear his first word was Porsche). I
do have to give my wife alot of credit for putting up with my habit,
she's coming around alittle and even attended the Porsche clubs 914
outing in Solvang, Ca. But, every time I get a new Porsche catolog she
still hides the credit cards.

 I worked for the DOD for 6 years, so I guess I can keep a secret, I'd
tell ya about it but then I'd hafta kill ya : ) all I can say is I can
not confirm or deney anything. I then deceded to brighten things up and
went to work for an Electric Utility, Southern Cal Edison and have been
with them for 8 yrs and work in the Bill Prosses Org. Basically I email
our Large customer's there Bills, its called EDI (Eletronic Data
Interchange).

 On to the Habit; It started harmlessly enough, back in 1986 when
someone wanted my toyota truck more than I and took it home with them.
My buddy I grew up with was a Porsche mechanic and said if I bought a
Porsche he'd work on it for free (couldnt pass that up) and in need of a
car we started looking. At the time I didnt want a 914, but found a one
owner 914-6 with 63,000 on the clock and original everything, except a
rebuilt motor (his college son had blown it up one spring break)
Learned   the cars where somewhat rare and bought it, joined PCA and put
it in the PCA Concours event at the Queen Mary and won 3rd place and all
I did was wash it ! It was that nice ! here's where it gets ugly.My
first wife thought we needed to live in a house and I SOLD (I know) the
car to a guy that took it back to Japan for his private collection.
Still hard to talk about..haha
To date I've had about 7 914's (2 parts cars), somewhere along the line
I deceded to do a six GT conversion since I couldnt afford a real one. I
sold off the then current weekend '74 2.0L and found a perfect '73 2.0L
without eng for my project (glad it was a 73 now!) One repaint over
orig, no accidents and no rust.I deceded if I was going to do a
conversion I also wanted to do a restoration at the same time, so I set
out to buy every new dealer and conversion part I could. I have to
admitt I have collected some really cool stuff (Steel GT flares,GT eng
lid, Stan Coopers Combo gauge, factory 8's and 9's, Turbo brakes and
tons new factory parts) the down side is I've spent around $13,000.00
and still need a 3.2L, paint job (strip to bare metal first), lots of
welding, trans gone thru and rubber. The up side is I get alot of my
parts at cost or the buddy deal price (Good friend in the right     
places : ) I figure about another 15K should do it, yeah I know this is
way too much to spend and I will NEVER get this back, but I dont care,
this is what I want, I figure a few Concours trophys and Im off to the
track :  ) Lately the project has kinda hit a slow spot (money) but Im
always looking for a few items, should pick up early next year. Hope to
have it completed in the next 2 years, but hopefully not that
long.......

Ok, WAKE UP !!! Sorry it was so long. I hope you all have a Great
Christmas and find a Porsche part under the tree (hope I do; ) 1998 is
around the corner and its sure to be GREAT !!!
Take Care, 

 Don
