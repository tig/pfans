914 Fans,

I'll give the Christmas message a shot:

I moved to Long Beach, CA three years ago after living 14 years in Rochester, NY (talk about a
change of scene!).  I am the Waterfront Director at Long Beach Yacht Club, at which I
administer all the boating programs for the fourth largest yacht club on the West Coast.

Am married to a wonderful woman (Lise) who I met about a month after moving to the Left
Coast; so I was able to personally challenge the old adage about the three most stressful things in
life being 1) a move, 2) a new job and 3) a new relationship.  Happy to report all are working out
nicely.  Lise was skeptical about the Porsche habit when we met, but we're now looking for a
early SC to replace her aging Honda Prelude, so I guess she's becoming a fan as well.

At 43 years old, I've been a Porsche addict for about the past 15 years. My first car was a 70 1.7
914, which I bought in November 1982 in Rochester; badly in need of paint and with every air
hose in the engine compartment rotting.  I drove that car the whole winter (and the next two as
well), and delighted in power-drifting around corners piled eight feet high with snow...and only
high-centered the thing twice.  My most enduring memory of that car was the day in February
(temp. -10) when I got out to retrieve the mail at my mailbox.  I closed the driver's door and the
door window shattered into the front seats.  When I sold it later, there were still glass shards in
the cockpit!

I moved on to 911s: first a '66 (best car I ever owned), then a 72T which I severely
track-modified, but still drove on the street.  Living about an hour North of Watkins Glen, it was
a natural progression to start performance driving, made all the easier, of course, by membership
in PCA.  Over a four year period I did 15 DEs at the Glen, and have also driven at Lime Rock,
Mid-Ohio, Mosport and others. 

Before moving to Cali I sold the 72 (sniff), but for some perverse reason saw fit to ship all my
spare parts out here.  Of course, SoCal is mecca for the P-habit, so I fell back into buying and
selling stuff almost immediately.  Have always traded, bought and sold parts as a means of
supporting the habit, and for the most part, have been able to make the parts game (almost) pay
for the nasty expenses involved with the cars I drive.

Last October we bought a 70T 911 which was hunkered down in a garage in Santa Monica...steel
Turbo flares and nary a stitch of mechanical clothing.  The past year has seen a complete
dismantling (at one point there was not a nut or bolt left on the chassis), paint/bodywork and
build-up as a dedicated track/race car.  Have done literally every bitof the work myself - well,
that's not exactly right, Lise helps too - and take pride in the fact that when things go wrong, we'll
know exactly how to get to them. I have always been electrically challenged ("whatya mean, it
flows like water?"), but have even managed to design and install a custom wiring harness,
employing breakers for five main circuits.  Right now we are at the critical (and expensive) drive
train stage.  I've designed, built and installed a dual-element rear wing from carbon/epoxy/
klegecell that is about the meanest looking thing you can imagine.  We expect to have it up and
running in March or April, with track dates at Willow Springs and other places on the schedule to
follow.

This project never would have been feasible without the Pomona Vintage Swap Meet...a
veritable cornucopia of all thing Porsche which happens every two months, year-round.  We've
now started a cottage business (Iko Iko Motorsports) to buy, sell and swap, as a result of  the
Pomona experience.  We go out there the night before, camp out with the VW homies and
Porsche mavens; then Lise sells parts from 5 a.m. to noon while I shop.  Every hour or so I go
back to the booth, take 3/4 of the money she's made, and go buy more race car parts. Our
Pomona weekends have become a fun and valued part of our life together.  It's great for tax
write-offs as well. 


Because the 914 and 911 share so many common components, I continue tofeel a kinship to the
914 P-Fans and enjoy reading the trials and tribulations which I fondly/not-so-fondly remember
from the early 80s. You guys share a down-to-earth bonhomie which is often sadly lacking
among many 911 owners.

As a release from the pressure of the day-to-day grind, the Porsche game can't be beat. Pretty
soon, we'll be sporting an SC on the front curb and a finished racecar in the garage/machine shop. 
Does life get any better than that?

Here's hoping you all have a great holiday season, filled with Koni gas shocks and 205/50/15s
stuffed under stock fenders.

Regards,

Chip Evaul
