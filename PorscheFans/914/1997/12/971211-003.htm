What lonigtudinal are you talking about? If you have any holes in the big
mombo lonigtudinal rocker sections that support the car, well, you're in
trouble. In the engine compartment, besides the battery support and
suspension console, you need to check at the base of the forward firewall,
both on the engine side and the passenger side. The reason is that the
firewall is really two sheets of metal with a space in between. Acidic water
can get in there are eat the metal. 

Take a sharp pointy object and try to poke through various areas near the
rusty spots, the base of the fire wall both on the engine and passenger
side, and the suspension console. You will probably find that the rust has
creeped under the paint and that the object will poke right through the metal.

The longitudinal and firwall are stressed members, as is the suspension
console. Use heavier gauge for these. Thin is OK for the battery tray
support. There is a replacement piece that you can buy anyway.

I dont' have any direct experience making repairs, but my body guy prefers
to plug weld (punch a hole in the overlapping piece, weld into the hole). He
says plug welding is much stronger than electrical spot welding. Also, be
sure to use the 3M weld through coating on the inside surface of the part
before you weld it in place, as well as on the area on the car that the part
welds to. 

For flush body panel repairs, he butt welds, then grinds the welds, then
fills with body filler.

OK, do not apply any rust proofing until after you paint the outside of the
car. The reason is that the rustproofing easily contaminates the metal and
is hard to remove. Avoid using and spraying any silicone based product any
where near the car before paint also. That stuff is very hard to remove and
will ruin your paint job. You must have a chemically clean surface before
painting, or you'll get fish eyes in the paint.

Depending on what type of equipment you have at your disposal determines how
you will apply the rust proofing. If you have an air supply, there are
sprayers for spraying both wax and under coating. Also, you can purchase
1/2" rubber plugs and drill holes in various places to apply the wax in to.
The air powered wax spryaer has a longish flexible tube that can be inserted
far into the holes to spray the entire inner surface with protective wax.
Places to drill are the suspension console and the big longitudinals. Always
try to drill into a place that will not be exposed to the elements. This
means drilling from inside the the passenger area into the inner rocker
panel (which may not be necessary anyway, since there are a couple of holes
already in them under the oval black covers), or inside the engine
compartment into the upper part of the suspension console.

The waxy type is used inside body cavities, undercoating is used on the
outside. 

If you don't have an air supply, then dont' drill any holes, since the tools
you'll have at your disposal will be more limited. I prefer Cosmoline
Weathershed, mostly because the aresol can has an adjustable nozzle that can
adjusted down to fine stream. I spray into any body hole I can find,
including the aforesaid inside rocker panels, up into all drain holes, into
the trailing arms, etc. 

Also, be sure to apply 3M brushable seam seal to every seam you can find,
including all those in the engine comaprtment. The seam has to be clean
first before applying the sealer. Also, 3M FlexiClear caulk is good. 

For rust removal, get the rotary 3M stripping pads, they work great.

The rear window is very easy to get out. It's basically held in by strip
caulk. Just pry it out, no big deal. You have to remove the interior around
the window first though.

I think the racers prefer the battery up front. Mine is in the rear trunk
right next to the front trunk bulkhead on the passenger side in a plastic box.
