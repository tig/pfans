If you don't plan on driving in inclement weather, then either the Yok
A509 or it's pricyer sibling the AVS-I would be good choices. The A509
is, IMHO, the best bang-for-the-buck tire on the market. I ran the AVS-I
as a street tire and really liked 'em. Had to swap 'em out last month
for some Gislaveds to get me to and from autoxes in the winter though.

The Bridgestone RE-71 is also a great tire, and has better wet weather
performance than the A509.

Hi folks. I finally found a replacement handbrake handle via the Renegade 914
club. Now that it is striped, painted, and ready to put on I am in trouble.
The old handle came off with a little pentrant and elbow grease but I can't
seem to get the pin off of the handle. I presume that I must keep pounding but
the question is in what direction? I can see a washer on the drivers side so
do I pound towards the body of the car. I don't want to break the pin and then
pay $10.00 bucks for it.

Thanks
