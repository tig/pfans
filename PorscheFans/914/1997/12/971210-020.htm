914 Fans:
 Finally got my 914 running without flooding the engine and 
pumping gas out of the tail pipe. It happen to be a couple of things.
Throttle Switch - One of the wires was broken inside the connector 
and another connector's tab was broken. I replaced both connectors 
with new ones.
Temp Sensor I - One of the connector tabs inside the terminal wasn't 
holding the connector in the terminal. Easy fix. Pulled connector 
tab up and reinserted the connector into the terminal.
Temp Sensor II - Checked connector on temp sensor II it was ok. 
Pulled Temp Sensor II out and checked with meter and it was within
specifications. Prior to this I checked all of the components and 
they were all within specs. Never thought about checking the 
connections with the meter. I disconnected the wiring harness from 
the ECU and checked the various components through the wiring harness 
and all are now within specifications.

 By the way, I read in the digest where JJ. was rebuilding the wiring 
harness on his car. I rebuilt mine also. All new terminals, rubber 
boots, all ends of wiring clipped to clean wire and new connectors  
soldered.

 I can turn the key over and the engine starts. When I run the car on 
the street, the car has a lot of power and it runs great for awhile. 
Then it will quit running. It doesn't buck or acts like it is out 
of gas (Full Tank). It stops running without any warning. I have 
checked the timing and it was off. I adjusted the timing and the car 
will start as before. I'm scratching my head on this one.I have 
changed the distributor rotor, distributor cap, I have checked the
the points and the trigger points, every thing looks ok. I have also 
checked the fuel pressure and it is at an even 29 psi. Does anyone 
have any idea of what may be happening. I would be thankful for an 
assistance I can get on this.
Thanks
Jim Branch
