	I have two data points on this.  Stan Hanks, former PFiles list-
meister and 911, 914, and 356 driver/mechanic, said that he did that to
his race motor(s).  Lots of coatings, all over everything.  "PlyDyne is
your friend," he once said to me.  He claimed some HP from it, and I
would not doubt it.  (Remember, this was a track-only car that got torn
down relatively frequently!)  He liked it.
	I have another friend who had parts of the head and valves in his
73 2.0 coated.  He doesn't like the results.  I think the main reason is
that his fuel mixture goes wonky after driving on the highway for a while.
He speculates that the heat now dissipates from the heads at a different
rate than with a stock motor, so the FI thinks the engine is warmer or
cooler than it really is, and it sets the mixture incorrectly.
	I know FI isn't an issue for you, Dirk, but it may be worth
thinking about.
