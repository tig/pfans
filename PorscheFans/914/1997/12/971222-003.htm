As Jeff can attest to, I ended the year with every intention of upgrading
to a 911 front end and redrilling the rears.  Of course, all things are
done on a budget.  When it came down to pricing front end assemblies, I
wasn't too shocked.  But when it came down to pricing wheels in the 7-9"
range for a five lug setup, it got a little rediculous.  So now I'm back to
the 320i conversion idea and run what I have for another year or two before
I upgrade to the 911 setup.  I'll get there, but at current budget it's
going to be a couple of years.

Rich,  I think it's a great idea, but cost would be my primary concern.  I
would have LOVED to pickup one of your other conversion kits, but the cost
was a little prohibitive for me.  Boy, I wanted those brakes!

Hope this helps a little,

Dion
