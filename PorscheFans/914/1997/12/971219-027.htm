First I should say how much I've enjoyed being on the pfans 914 list.
I've learned so much more than I ever thought possible, and what a
great bunch. Makes me proud to still be a 914 owner.

I'm a Software Engineer for Schlumberger Well Services in Austin TX.
Besides the 914, other fun stuff includes a Toyota 4-Runner 4x4 and a
Red Honda VFR750. I also have a brand new house with (finally) a
good sized garage. I'm 41, single, with a girlfriend named Helen, aka
'the Helster', who does not like small cars - that's a different story,
but not without some overlap as she can be, shall we say, influential.

My interest in 914s began in '78 when a friend rescued a '75 from a salvage
yard (engine fire). After installing dual webers, a new clutch and alloy wheels
(4 for $100), the car turned out pretty nice and was loads of fun. It had
it's quirks though - it leaked like a sieve, we pushed it frquently due to
electrical and starter problems, and it wore of pair of vice grips on the
clutch tube for at least a year before we fixed it.

At the time I was ending an affair with early model Mustangs...
A 68 GT 390, followed by 71 Mach 1 with 351 cleveland, C-6,
positrack, headers, 780 holley, etc. - boy, those cars could really suck
your eyeballs back in their sockets. Anyway,

In 1979, I purchased my (one and only) 914 - a 1976 2.0, Ancona blue,
black interior, with appreance group (cloth seats, fog lamps, console).
What a fine little machine it was. My girlfriend at the time liked it and
we found her a pristine white 74 1.8 with mahle alloys, so there were 3 in our
little fan club. This was my daily driver from '79 - '85, and I put about 80k
miles on the car and drove it literally all over the state. I had the engine
professionally rebuilt with OEM parts by Swiss Garage in Houston at about 100k
miles (just a bad rocker arm, so probably premature). Sad but true, it then
sat under a cover most of the time due to other interests, driven only enough
to keep the battery charged. This dwindled into monthly until it wouldn't run
at all, and it slowly began returning to nature.

Summer '95 began a concerted effort to get it running again and this turned
into you guessed it, DirkWrights disease. At present the car is stock,
mechanically fine, but needs paint. Over the years the car has been reliable,
and has never left me stranded except for once when a transaxle broke. I've made
the usual repairs (most recently) - minor rust, clutch tube, pedal assembly,
brakes (SS lines, 19mm mc), shift linkage, rear springs, KYB shocks,
re-upholster seats, new seat belts, new MPS, trigger points, couple of
injectors,
reseat rear window, rubber, bursch, etc., etc., etc.
Ok, so I'm slowly replacing the whole car. I plan to address a few more
mechanical issues (heating system, front sway bar) before I strip it and
have it painted.

My objective is to have a clean, reliable, yet quick example for street use.
I also plan to autocross some next year (I think it's ready - we'll see), and
I'd like to run it on the track a time or two in a PCA drivers school.

When someone asks if it's a real Porsche, I point to the crest on the steering
wheel and explain "Yes, it's a poor man's Porsche", but I think that's changing.

Happy Holidays to all.

Alan B.
