I totally agree.  My car started out as wanting to be restored and driven
daily in the Summer....untill I stripped all the paint off and found what
was under it.  Then I took the engine apart and found what was in it.  Then
i took the suspension apart, and found it almost wasn't there.  Your right
Mike, many of these cars make an early exit to the junk yard in the sky.
But I consider mine saved, but not worth the money or effort to restore to
stock condition.  So now it's butchered, modified, tweaked, pumped, soon to
be flared and hopefully soon to have an early 911 front end.  And next
Summer, the only road it will see is to the autocross and back.  But it
puts a huge smile on my face everytime I sit behind the wheel, whether it's
parked in the garage or not.  And hands down, it's faster than any stock
914 I've seen at any autocross.  (It makes up for the lack of driver behind
the wheel)

Oh by the way, my Wife says that after she gets her 944, I can start
looking for another 914.  Preferably a 73 2.0liter with low miles in
concourse condition.  That will be my everyday Summer car!!!

Like my wise younger Brother says, "People have fun in different ways"

Come on, I don't give him a hard time for trying to modify his lowly RX-7  :).

Not a flame, just MHO.

Thanks Josh,
I wanted  the 225's on the front, so that's good news. I'm still not sure
about the 245/50's on the rear. As far as I can tell, they look like they will
fit with 8 inch wheels. I would just like to know for sure before I buy them. 

> My big concern is when I want to go to 9 inch rims up front with 245 width
tires. 

Josh, Did you say 245's on the front? With 9 inch wheels? Now thats SERIOUS
rubber. I hope you have BIG arms. Just out of curiosity, what size rears are
you planning to use?
