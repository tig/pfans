AWSOME!!! Welcome to the gang!

Nope, we're just going to help you get into it even deeper. :)

First off, if you really intend on autoxing in competively, then before
doing ANY mods to it, (What am I going to say kids?...) "READ THE
RULES". If you intend on running in SCCA events for anything more than
just grins, then those five bolt hubs will disqualify you out of Stock
or Street Prepared right off. The rules specifically forbid modifying
the brake rotors, calipers or hubs. It's a sucky rule, but a rule
nonetheless. Those five lug hubs will put you into D-Prepared.

As for tire size? I can, and do, fit 225s on 4-7/8 backspace 6 inch rims
under stock fenders. But that's JUST fitting, and I rub -just a little-
on both inner and outer fender walls. Even going up to a 7" rim will
probably make the tire too wide for the rear wheel well. Now all 914s
are different, so it just might be possible on yours, but I wouldn't
hold my breath. But the safe bet is to run the 205/50-15.

Pull the smog pump, plug the hole, and go to early SSIs and muffler.
Pretty easy if you're patient. No reliability problems to the best of my
knowledge, and a good 10hp gain right off the bat probably. But you'll
get much better power gains by bolting in an early 2.0L motor instead.

That's Dirk's pet, and 914s don't recognise Guibos. Ask Dirk for the
enlightened description. It's a Bimmer thing...
