$4k for a clean and straight 2.0L with autox goodies is really
stretching it. Maybe if you find one with a shot engine or tranny, but
not likely. A decent one, requiring some restorative work, with a
straight chassis, and stock suspension, could be found however. The best
thing to do is keep looking. I looked for months before getting mine,
and it did need some serious work, but the chassis was clean and
straight.

Is this for PCA or SCCA autox?

What do you want to do with the RX-7? ("Uh oh" says everyone, "Here goes
josh on his rotary kick again...."). If it's for C-Stock in SCCA autox,
then don't even think about the GSL. If however, you really like the
idea of the new spec RX-7 class for SCCA raod racing, then get the GSL.
The GSL-SE has the 13B motor, and while it's considerably more powerful
than the 12A in the GSL (Hence it's high demend for C-Stock in Solo2),
it's not allowed in the spec RX-7 class. This also helps keeps the costs
down for the budding road racer.

But first off, decide what you want to do with the car. Then when you've
picked a club and a class to compete in, READ THE RULES. If you buy a
car with "all the autox goodies" it may have one too many goody and bump
the car up into the trailer-riding-firebreathing-monster classes.
