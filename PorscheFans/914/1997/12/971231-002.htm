Well, according to that repair book we've been raving about "How to Rebuild
Your Volkswagen Air-Cooled Engine" by Tom Wilson, James Thorusen's valve
adjustment method is just fine. Check out page 138 "Setting Valves." It's
duplicated right there.

Also, the book has convinced me to convert to hydraulic lifters, though I
don't know when I'll do that. I can't decide to wait until what I have
wears out, or tear the case apart and "do it now." I know Dave will say,
"just drive the damn car!"

The author states that the hydraulic lifters are good to 6,000rpm, which is
more than the rest of the valve train can tolerate anyway. What convinced
me though is that with hydraulic lifters, the valve clearance is
automatically compensated for temperature changes. Thus the valves always
have the correct adjustment from cold startup to 90mph blasts down the back
straight. Also, always having the correct adjustment means that there is
more power available over time and temperature changes. Mechanical lifters
set the correct clearance at only one temperature. With such a hot running
motor as ours, hydraulic lifters make a lot of sense to me.
