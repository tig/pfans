If you bring the car up to about 5000 rpm under load, and then let it coast
back down (leaving it in the same gear the whole time), do you hear the
backfiring?  Did you at any time remove your exhaust to do the valve
adjustment or any other work?  If so, I'd suspect a small exhaust leak
between the heat exchangers and the heads.  This can sometimes be verified
by inspecting the tops of the pushrod tubes for exhaust residue.  It's
really critical that the heat exchangers get seated in the heads correctly,
and always use new copper gaskets.  As far as the brakes go, have you tried
"seating" them?  I had an Rx7 that squealed a lot when I put on new pads,
but several very aggressive stops from about 50 mph put a stop to that.
Basically, you've got to get the surface of the pad to match the surface of
the rotor, and there's only one way to do it... use.
