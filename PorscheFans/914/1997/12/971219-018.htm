Oh, I wasn't thinking of adjusting to compensate for another FI problem, but
I was thinking of adjusting it for better performance.  For example, if,
while racing, the engine could benefit from being a little rich (or lean),
then turn it one way (or the other).  While cruising around, you could set
it back to "normal".  That kind of thing...  You'd need to "calibrate" the
various resistances to their corresponding CO reading, but I was just
wondering if there was a practical application for something like this...
