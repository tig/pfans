	They're here!!  They're here!!  The new phone books are
here!!!   I'm sombody now.

	Actually the new tires are here.  All I can tell you
is that they weigh pretty much exactly 20# each (A509 195-60HR-15).
The good news is they have a tread wear rating of 160 so they should
last 3.2 times as long as my A008s did ;-)

	I was worried when I was stuffing them into the car (good thing
they weren't mounted) that the sidewalls seemed kinda flimsy, but it
says they are two ply.

	I couldn't believe Discount Tire would not give me the tracking
number for UPS so I could have them held for Will Call pickup.  UPS
did a lot of extra work jumping through hoops to find them and hold them.
Especially this time of year.  There would have been a lot less risk of
me missing these if they only gave out the number.  (UPS has no problem
with shippers giving tracking numbers to customers).
Thanks UPS
