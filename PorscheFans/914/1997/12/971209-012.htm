Yeah, I just got word from George Hussey, master of all 914 trivia, and he
did indeed confirm that the 914/6 hand throttle would fit if the special
914/6 accelerator pedal crank was installed. However, all of these parts are
NLA and therefore very rare and expensive. A 914/6 parts car is a rare thing
indeed!

Now I just wonder if the much more common 911 hand throttle could be
retrofitted/re-engineered/hacked to fit and look half way decent. I could
probably make my own linkage if I had the dang little hand lever. Maybe I
could modify a heater control to do the job. It's been so long since I've
been poking around my 914 that I can't remember right now.
