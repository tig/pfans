I'm glad it seems like a good book. I plan on getting it soon.

We say don't use 'em because it's an extra 0.060 off the deck height and
is worth a few points of compression. But there is no TSB from porsche
regarding the omission of the head gasket and as such I doubt the author
would recomend it.

That's a bad one there I guess. I refuse to use RTV unless there's no
other alternative. The idea of little bitty chucks of the stuff getting
sucked into the engine and colgging a bearing oil passage are not things
I like to dwell on.
