Since I had Friday off, I got out to the garage and did some of
the things I've been putting off for a month or so.  First on the
list was putting the canopy back on my pickup (it hangs in the
garage above the 914 when it's not on the truck.)  Well, gee, then
I guess I need to roll the Porsche out.  Hmmm... It's got a tire
going low, better run down to the corner gas station and pump that
up.  So off I went.  The weather was overcast, but didn't look like
rain, so I left the top off.  An hour and a half later I finally
made it back home, with a silly grin frozen on my face (I didn't
notice later that afternoon that the high for the day was 34 deg.)
and a strong reminder of why I bought this car in the first place-
and fresh motivation to get out there and fix all those niggly 
things that keep me from driving it more often.
