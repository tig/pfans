	BING!!  OK, if you're getting a good white spark from the wire
to the center terminal of the distributor cap, you've just eliminated
90%+ of the ignition system.  If you're still getting a weak spark at
the spark plugs, just check the stuff from there back to that center
wire.
	Do you get a good spark from the end of the plug wire to ground?
If yes, then replace your plugs (try regular Bosch Coppers, they're good
enough!) and see what happens.  Of course, if your problem is with all
four cylinders, then the problem is likely not the plugs or wires.
	Check the condition of the cap and rotor--CAREFULLY.  Check the
resistance of all the pieces.  Put them together, point the rotor toward
one of the outer terminals, and measure reisitance from the center term-
inal to that outer one.  Or just replace both cap and rotor.  Make sure
that the center cap electrode contacts the rotor reasonably.  It's spring-
loaded so it should do that.  Make sure that the rotor just about touches
the outer electrodes.

	So, JJ--you've just eliminated almost *all* of the car from your
search for the weak spark problem.  Good stuff, n'est ce-pas?  The problem
is somewhere between the end of that center wire and the spark plugs.
