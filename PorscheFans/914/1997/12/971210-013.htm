Yeah, I put a new Bosch Super Blue in there.  It didn't make a
difference when compared to the old stock coil, so I suspect they're
both O.K., rather than them both being bad.  I checked the resistance of
the coil, and it looks good, and I checked the voltage going to the
coil, and it looks good as well.  If I pull the wire to the top of the
distributor cap and tape it up about 1/4 in. from a ground, a white
spark will jump it with no problem, so I'm guessing everything is O.K.
with the coil.  Anything else I should check?

Thanks again,
