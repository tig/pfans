	My 914 was riding kinda low.  Ok, I know they all do.
But I was on the bump stops (or the springs went solid) if I accelerated
up a hill or sometimes even on the level.  With a passenger it
happened all of the time.  Kinda irritating.  So today, I got around to
installing these little rubber spacers and it raised it about an inch
so the lip is now 1/2 to 3/4 inches below the top the tire.  World
of difference though.  It really worked.  But the tranfer of weight forward
and the raising of the GC now causes the rear brakes to actually lock up
now.  Looks like I'll have to get under there and readjust that proportioning
valve..

	The best part is the 2 to 3 degrees of negative camber in the
rear is gone (almost).  This is what really killed my last set of tires.
I hope this helps the wear characteristics of my new ones.   That's
all.

	I should have added in paragraph one:  I felt like one of those
lowered pickups because I knew that the tires were acting as the spris.
Tire spring rates are about 800lbs/inch vs the 60 lbs/in wheel rate I measured last time I looked at it.
