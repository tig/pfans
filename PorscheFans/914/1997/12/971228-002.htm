Judye, and the list...-

>Price is $300 per pair for hubs.  
>Five bolt rotors are $112 per set.

I am looking at upgrading my 73 914 to 5 bolt.
Does this mean that with the above hubs and rotors, I will have (front) 5
lug, yet retain my 914 shocks and torsion bars?
I would still need 911 calipers right?  If so which one?
Will I need the  same offset in wheels as if I did the conversion with a
complete 911 setup?
I am planning on only 6" 911 wheels nothing really wide with stock
fenders.  (I want the ability to swap my 68 912 wheels with the 914 and
visa versa)
List members, what do you think?
BTW I already have early rear rotors ready to send out.

Thanks!

Hi Folks! Hope everyone had a good christmas. I received the Brian Long book
yesterday and I intend to read  it cover to cover this weekend. Next weekends
project is to replace the intake manifold hoses. My question is this. Is it
easier to remove the plenium or the manifold pipes from the block. I did buy
gaskets but it looks like I would have to remove the air cleaner, etc. in
order to get at the pipes on the drivers side. Has anyone done this and which
is the easiest approach.

Thanks
