A friend of mine has a Haltech FI system which was on his 73 2.0 liter when
he bought it.  After messing with it for more than a couple of seasons, he
went and put carbs on it.  He knows the FI would probably be the better way
to go, but he prefers carbs and doesn't want the FI anymore.

The only specs I know are that the throttle bodies are 44mm.  He is
considering selling it and wanted me to put a message out to everyone
asking what a good price is.  So I guess he's kinda taking offers if the
price is right.  He isn't trying to make a firtune on this, but neither of
us knows what a new system goes for, therefore we ask the wisdom of the list.

Even if you're not interested, what's the going value?
