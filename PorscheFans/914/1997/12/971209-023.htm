	To test your decel valve, pull the hose from it to the
air cleaner off of the air cleaner.  Start the car, and use the
lever on the throttle butterfly to rev the car up to about 3500
RPM.  Let go of the lever so that the throttle snaps closed.
You should feel air rushing into the disconnected hose.  If you
don't, then the valve is either hooked up wrong or is non-func-
tional.
	Behavior like this can also be caused by other miscel-
laneous fuel injection/ignition problems.
	First, check the health of your ignition system.  Plugs,
wires, cap, rotor, and especially points&condensor.  Make sure
the timing and dwell are OK.
	Next, check for vacc leaks anywhere.  And everywhere.  If
it's been more than a couple of years since the hoses were last
replaced, it may be a good idea to replace them now.
	Next, start checking the various components of the FI
system--sensors, etc.  Kjell Nelin has a very good reference for
the D-jet system, which lives in the Tech Refs section of Tim's
914 Fan Page <http://www.estinc.com/porsche>.  It will tell you
what the "typical" values for the various sensors are.
	Finally, you can try to vary the fuel mixture and see if
the behavior improves or not.  You can put a potentiometer (a
variable resistor) in between the head temp sensor and the wiring
harness.  A 0-500 Ohm, 1 Watt pot will do nicely.  You can make
the fuel mixture richer by increasing the resistance of this
circuit with the potentiometer.  (See Rat Shack or other local
electronic hobbyist's supply place.)  You can try decreasing the
system fuel pressure (just a bit!) if you want to see what a
leaner mixture does.

	Good luck, and let us know how it turns out!  My car does
the same thing, but to a lesser extent.
