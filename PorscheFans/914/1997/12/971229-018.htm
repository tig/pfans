	I feel compelled to point out here that Jim and I disagree
a bit about valve adjusting procedures.
	On my 2.0 motor, shortly before its rebuild, I measured the
valve clearance on an exhaust valve while the intake valve on that
same cylinder was open.  It was larger than it should have been.
Then I rotated the engine until that cylinder was at TDC--both
valves were closed, and the fan mark was either at top or bottom (I
forget which cylinder).  The measurement was on spec.
	When I asked, I got two replies (Stan Hanks and AA's George
Hussey) that indicated that the geometry of the valve train could
increase the valve clearance at some points along the camshaft's
rotation.
	I don't know if this was simply due to a wasted camshaft
(it was replaced during the rebuild, and definitely needed it!) or
if that really is normal.  However, I now always rotate my engine
until the cylinder I am adjusting is at TDC, just in case.  I keep
intending to check both methods against each other, and I keep
forgetting.
	One "extra" tip:  My flywheel has a notch that is equivalent
to the TDC mark on the fan.  When the fan mark is showing through
the inspection hole, you can put a paint mark on the flywheel
through the notch in the bottom of the tranny bellhousing.  After
that dries, you can rotate the engine until you see the flywheel
notch.  Paint it, too.  Now you have TDC and 180-degree marks that
are visible from underneath the car.
