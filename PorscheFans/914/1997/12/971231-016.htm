OK, I didn't get that part from the book. I assumed that since the redline
is something like 5800rpm, they meant it. Still, 6 grand is plenty of
headroom for me.

Just a nice driver. I'm not excited about adjusting the valves every other
oil change.

One thing I've noted about these engines is that they do not have very good
temperature regulation. The flaps open up at a fairly low temperature, so
there can be wide fluctuations in actual operating temperature, it seems to
me. What this means is that the clearances will change depending on the
temperature of the outside air. I dont' like this. Water cooled cars are
much better at regulating operating temperature.
