	Hi, all.  Last weekend, I really earned the nickname that
Jebby has stuck upon me.  That's right, I worked the Club Race at
Sears Point.  I guess that makes me a glutton for punishment.
	The weather was actually relatively good on both Friday
and Saturday.  In fact, it was better than we had any right to
expect.  The track was still a bit damp from the Thursday night
showers, as a certain Race Official (who will remain nameless as
long as he keeps coming up with the blackmail money  ;^) proved
by looping the Dodge Intrepid pace car the first time through the
Carousel.
	Considering the conditions, there were very few mishaps or
incidents of any kind.  However, some 911 (or a 914 or 944 with a
HUGE extra oil tank!) put a line of oil about 1.5" wide on the
track.  Starting at Turn 1, and finishing in the pit lane next to
Turn 11!  That took a little while to clean up--we had three guys
on the tailgate of a pickup, one pouring grease sweep out of a
cone, and two with brooms dragging behind the cone.  We also had
the Sears Point truck helping us by doing the same thing in the
other direction.
	Still, there were relatively few mishaps.
	Saturday was brighter and sunnier, and the track was close
to dry.  We had someone's oil line go in Turn 10, which made for a
BIG grease stain to clean up, and collected that car and one other
off on the side of the track.  Amazingly, it looked like neither
one even touched the tire wall!
	We had a few more incidents, some of which will eventually
involve body shop work.  But that seems to be average for a Club
Race weekend at Sears Point.
	Sunday was a different story.  It rained all Saturday night,
and the track was slick, muddy, and very wet.  There was one minor
mishap on the drag strip (VERY slippery when wet) early on.  Then
the rain started up again--HARD.  Sessions were postponed, and then
cancelled all together.  When the weather broke, there were about
30 people who still wanted to go--probably all those crazy Midwes-
terners and East Coast folks.  You know, the ones who actually race
in the rain!  These folks were consolidated into one run group, and
given a three-lap drive-around.
	Someone (I'm expecting more blackmail money here) managed
to conclude the drive-around by looping his/her car right after
getting the checkered flag.  We're talking multiple 360s on the
drag strip.  And I'd already put the camera away!   8^(   Oh well.
	The rain kept rolling in in waves--VERY hard rain, followed
by lighter rain, and then the skies would clear for about 20 minutes
and we'd have sunshine.  Then the next wave would hit, HARD.
	The 30 intrepid souls began their pace lap, behind a shiny
new Boxster loaned to the event by the local dealer.  At the end of
the lap, the Boxster signalled the lead car to follow it into the
pits instead of going around to start the race.  The rain had got-
ten into the land-line communications system, and we lost communi-
cation with the corner workers.  If you've been to Sears, you know
that you don't run it without corner workers.  So that was the event.
	A bit of an anticlimax, but there's only so much you can do
to keep the event going.  Still and all, it was a pretty good time.
	Since I spent a lot of time wandering around in the rain on
Sunday, I was very definitely Damp Dave by the end of the day.  I
think I may have managed to dry out by today (Thursday).
