How about this advice don't do it!

This is not something you look at a picture and build out of any tubing
you find around.  It takes a lot of engineering to build a good roll bar
or cage, plus it takes a set of rule books.  If you insist on doing it
your self, please find someone to look over your drawings and make sure
you know what you are doing.

Sorry if I offended, but I have looked into this, doing a rather
elaborate design, that would allow for a very extensive mount system. 
But I have found it may be easier to just buy one and bolt it into place.

Books - All of Carrol Smiths books and the HP book on metal working which
has a chapter on tube fitting.

But this is not a project to be done at a whime with a buzz box welder. 
If you have a TIG and are really good and fitting tubes go for it.  If
not leave it to a pro.
