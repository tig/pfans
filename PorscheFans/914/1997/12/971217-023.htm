A couple of years ago I went through exactly the same thing with my 72 914
1.7 liter.  I attempted a rebuild myself with new a new NPR big bore kit,
but I was very dissapointed in the increases, if any, of power.  I called
MotorMeister out on the left coast and got a respectable figure of about
$1800 with some mild modifications, not much.  The guy I talked to asked me
to fax him my detailed requirements (which we just got done covering for
the previous 1/2 hour), and he would call me back with the exact price.  I
heard nothing for the next three weeks.  When I could finally get the guy
to come to the phone, he told me they decided there wasn't enough money in
rebuilding 4's, only 6's.  So he decided this from the time he hung up to
the time he received my fax.

After seeing this list always talk about 2.0 liters, and nothing else most
of the time, I decided to start looking for a good 2.0 liter motor.  Plus,
a good friend of mine autocrossed his 2.0 liter and I loved watching him
beat the pants off of 911's.  I looked for something I could just bolt in
and start up.  I thought I found it for $900 on a claimed 65,000 mile
motor.  When i got it home, and after a bit of shipwright's disease, I
determined the cam was shot.  My friend (and soon to be competition)
offered to help me rebuild the motor since he has already done one.  So
during last Winter we slowly rebuilt the motor to a total cost of probably
about $500, including a three-way valve job, new guides, new seals, new
rings, new gaskets, new mild cam from FAT, but not including new carbs from
PMO (to come along later).  I'm probably forgetting things, but the end
result was a great running engine with lots of power and lots of new
knowledge gained by its owner.

Sorry this is long, but I'm in a writing mood for some reason tonight.
I've seen lots of 2.0 liters for sale out there, but be careful if you
intend to buy a used engine.  Then again, rebuilding one was not that tough
when I got the correct help.  As a matter of fact, since the engine swap
put my 'good' CSP car into AP (among other things), I can't wait to build a
true AP motor, maybe starting this Spring for the 99 season.

Good Luck!
