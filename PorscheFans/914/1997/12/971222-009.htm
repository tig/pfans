FYI 914ers,

"Porsche 914 & 914-6" became available at the Barnes and Noble web site
on Saturday. It came today (next day air for 4 bucks!). After looking at
it just briefly, I can say it looks quite good. It's much more
substantive than "Caught by the Camera" with a brief Porsche history,
and a lot of historical details. He states in his preface that most of
his facts come from the factory and so far I don't doubt it. Lots of
good pics, although almost all are B&W. A pretty good purchase for $30.
Dunno when Amazon will have it, but Barnes has it now. Gotta go - I have
some reading to do!
