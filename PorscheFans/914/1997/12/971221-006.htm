	I put the A509s on today.
This is in two parts.
Part1:
	I put my A008rs with the mahles on yesterday and this morning.
I can't believe I was saving these for autocrossing.  They were 185-70-15
and made the car very skittish on the road.  They were 10 years old from
the date code on thsidewall.  Braking was terrible, ride at 30psi was
terrible.  Good riddance.  I was worried when I was installing them.
I found a gouge of sorts on the inside edge of two of them.  Looking
in the front fenderwells I found corresponding marks.  These would not have
lasted too much longer in parking lots.  They were too damn big.  I made
me wonder if the 195-60-15 were too big....
	The A509s are on.  THe verdict is not in but...  Wow, this
is like riding in a Lincoln.  These are like touring tires are supposed
to be.  They may just be underinflated (30-32), I don;t know yet.  Braking
is loud, cornering is quiet.  Response is nil.  It could still be a lack
of pressure.  It could be  that the sidewalls are more trapazoidal than
verticle (5.5inch rims).  Braking seems to be poorer than the Comp T/A
HR4s, ot
or at least on par, response is definitely weaker, lateral adhesion
seems to be better so far.  I haven't been on the wrong side of the envelope
yet.  I've only driven to work and back ~~ 10 miles.  I certainly have more
exploring to do.  I have to get out the pyrometer to set the air pressure
and the GPS receiver to calibrate the speedo/tach.
	The good thing is it FITS.  IN front of the tire store I turnes
them lock to lock and pushed the car listening for bad sounds.  There
were none.  I crawled underneath and found about one fingernail worth
of clearance on on side and about half that much on hte other.
All in all it was 279.28  in my hands three days later from discount
tires direct and 67.92 mount and balance at NTW (oops NTB) formre
formerly Tire America.  Best deal locally was just over 400 dollars.
You HAVE to watch those guys.  I was on the other side watching an
alignment on another car when I noticed the tire he was taking off
the mounter was on backwards.  Turns out that was the fourth one.
I had to explain what "This side faces outwards" means.  He wanted the
"dots" on the inside.  Then he tries to slide a static balance in on
me.  Sheese!
