My name is Robert Allred, I live in the Salt Lake City area of Utah.
My Porsche interest goes back to 1964 when my Dad and I had a common
interst in buying a red 356C.  But a breakdown in price negotiations
with the dealer lead to a (ouch!) Corvair Spyder instead.  In the years
since, Dad reconsidered and has owned several 912's, indeed has a nice
'67 model now, which I'm helping him restore, and will probably take
over soon as his driving years are about behind him.  

As for me, the early interest in Porches lead to many years experience
with lower cost used English sports cars, MG, Sunbeam, Triumph, 'Healy,
etc, then a serious and long lasting affliction with off-road
motorcycles & jeeps.  Middle age, certainly not maturity, has brought
appreciation for more dependable Japanese products, currently an MR2 and
most recently a Miata which I've started to use in autox.  

But my early Porsche interest refuses to die!  I have begun to study and
want to find & purchase a 2.0 914 for a restoration intended to result
in a clean "fun racer" for PCA autox and club racing.

I guess you can see I'm a car nut, and figure the more interesting two
seaters I can somehow fit into the garage, the better.  Honestly, my
wife must have the patience of a saint!

Anyway, I've enjoyed reading the list for the past month or so, and who
knowes, maybe when I find the right 914, I'll be able to add more to the
list as I learn more about the car.

Happy Holidays, Everyone!

Robert
