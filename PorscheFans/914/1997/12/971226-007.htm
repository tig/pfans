  Sam Matthews asked (and Mike Cooley asked a similar question):

  "Rocking" means any cam-driven movement of the rocker arm...
ideally, we want the point of maximum valve opening, which means the
valve we want to adjust is on the part of the cam lobe that is
exactly opposite to the peak.   However, in actual practice, the cam
lobe is of a mild enough shape that any movement of the opposite
rocker means that you are in a good position to adjust your valve.  
To minimize steps, a compromise position is used in several of the
valve "rocking" instructions; i.e. you will find that one valve opens
before the other, and I believe that in at least one case,  a valve
will have gone past the point of maximum opening and will start to
close before you see the other valve that it is paired with it start
to move.   As long as you are sure that both valves listed in the
"rocking" column are open to some degree, you will be in the right
place to adjust the opposite pair of valves.
    Looking at the upper valve spring retainers is a good way to
tell;  if the valve is open, the top retainer will be below the line
formed by the tops of the others.
I usually turn the road wheel for the best compromise between the two
valves, that is, where I get the maximum total opening if I were to
sum the linear movement of the two "rocking" valves.   This sounds
harder than it is;  you will find that it is quite easy to turn the
engine with one hand on the un-blocked road wheel, and you can go
back and forth for maximum "rock", a point that is easily judged by
eye with the valve train in motion.
  
   I hope this clears things up.
