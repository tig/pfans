I've got the VW book too, and I dont agree with
RTV (Room Temperature Vulcanizing) application to the
tube seals.  The reason is that the engine parts expand and
contract due to heat/cool cycles.  The PR tubes actually
move slightly in the seal bores as these thermal cycles occur.
 -that is why many engines leak at these points. .the O-rings
cannot keep up with that sort of cyclic repetetive strain.

I've had an engine that had RTV (blue) on the tubes and it
did seem to work -for a while.  If you are going to do it, goop
only *one* end of the tube so the other can move.
  I think a better solution is to use the highest quality
O-rings you can find.  I favor 'Viton' seals, but they are not a part
of aftermarket rebuild kits.
So you have to purchase these separate, and they are somewhat
expensive.  EBS in Sparks NV has them, there may be other
sources. EBS: 800.462.3774 ask for Jon.
The Viton seals I have are rust colored and are different from
the black, blue, green or red seals I've seen in rebuild kits.
They seem harder in durometer, but they are more heat resistant
than silicon, so they say.
That leaves you with how to seal the damn things in the bores. . .
the factory manual says use grease, but which, is up to you.
 -you must clean thoroughly the bores for a best glide surface
and seal.  The tube lands where the rings go must also be clean
and concentric.  Grease both tube lands and bores because glide
can occur at either point.  Newly O'ed tubes fit tight, and the tendency
is to nick the seals on insertion. . .grease helps, dexterity and
patient persistence helps more.
A top-quality hi-temp grease should do the job, but
even then, these suckers are gonna leak with time.
  Its what Porsches do.
