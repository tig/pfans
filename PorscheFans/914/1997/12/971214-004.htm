Yes it is. But thee may be a shadow of a chance that it might be able to
get reclassed because of some recent SEB rulings on what is or isn't
allowed.

The best thing about PCA in my opinion. You get a great deal of seat
time, and instruction that other simply clubs don't match.

And both outclass the venerable 914. But have I given up? Hell no, I
like the 914 way too much.

I wouldn't say that it won't do _any_ good. But it's true that you won't
be able to gain anywhere near as much out of it asyou would if you could
tune the exhaust system. But it's true, headers are not allowed on the
914 in a class where every single other car is allowed to use tuned
headers. Kinda stinks huh?

Definately the way to go, but 10" wheels won't fit under commonly
available flare kits and you'll need expensive custom work done at that
point. 9" wheels however _wil fit. And can still hold the 245/45-15
tires very well.

I'd say use the bursch extractor, it's the closest you'll get to tuning
the exhast as the rules will allow. And then maybe a glasspack muffler
to keep the noise down. But definately get the SSI heat exchangers. It
may not do too much, but every little bit helps.

First thing is definately to get more air into the engine, but the D-jet
FI while quite reliable cannot produce the power you/we will ultimately
need in Street Prepared trim. Certainly the gains will be less with an
untuned exhaust system, but raising the combustion pressure and mapping
the ignition can still be worth a bit of power. In addition, it will
help you get away from the problem that the D-jet has on straightaways.
It leans out very badly at sustained high rpms.

Oh yeah. Definately.

I'm still unconvinced. I personally believe that adding a LSD is simply
a waste of money. If you really do have wheelspin problems, then maybe
it'll help. Otherwise it's alot of money and extra weight as well.

Yup! :)
 
As for the GTI? I humbly suspect that it will be more competetive in DSP
than a 914 will in CSP. Is it as fun to drive? Nope. And that's why I
havn't crossed back over to the dark side (Front drivers).
