	Congrats!  It's rare to find an original, unmolested example.
Welcome to the wonderful world of 914 ownership!

>1- I'll be upgrading to 5-bolt pattern (thanks Rich) - what  are the maximum
>tire sizes I can run with the stock fenders (probably run SCCA Solo II -
>CSP) on a Fuchs 15 x 7?

	Varies from car to car; many can cope with a 205/60-15 (at least,
on a 5.5" rim--dunno about 7") with some folding under of the rear fender
lip.  Some cars, though, can only deal with 195's (195/65-15 approximates
the original rolling diameter reasonably), while I know of one car that
couldn't even fit those on one side!
	They joys of owning a hand-built car--Welcome to the wonderful
world of 914 ownership!

>2- I live in NH ("Live Free Or Die" state) where there are no smog checks.
>Is it relatively easy to de-smog the 1.8? If I do, any downside to
>reliability? Any idea to upside power gains?

	If the car has a smog pump:  Remove the pulley from the middle of
the fan.  Remove the pump and associated tubing and hoses, block off any
holes left by such.  (Two in each head, possibly one on the air cleaner,
maybe more?)
	Buy stainless steel heat exchangers (SSI's) from a private party,
or from GPR (800/321-5432) and a stock 1.7 or 1.8 muffler.  Be careful with
the studs holding the exhaust onto the heads, and with all the exhuast
fasteners in general.  Liquid Wrench is your friend.
	Save all the original parts (including catalytic converter, if
equipped).  They're expensive!

>3 - Now that I'm posting my 1st message to the list as a 914 owner, could
>someone tell me what the heck a "Guibo" is? And if I inadvertently find one,
>are they endangered (grin :-)? Seems this is the only list that even
>recognizes their existence, much less even tries to save them...

	Dirk Wright knows.  I think it has something to do with Nacho
Cheese-flavored axle grease or upholstery glue...    ;^)
