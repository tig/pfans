I also have been debating on what I am going to do.  I have a fiberglass
piece that drops about 4" below the bumper.  It had an 1/8" thick rubber
sheet with a piece of flexible plastic behind that was another 4" and
brought the whole thing to within a couple of inches of the ground.  I
have a V8 so have 2 holes in the bumper.  I was thinking of putting more
of an angle on the fiberglass piece in order to get more air flow at low
speeds. I am also thinking of putting an adjustable damper under the
radiator that dumps under the car.  The specific point I was going to
make is that I replaced the rubber with a piece of gasket material from
McMaster Carr that is 1/8" thick and half the width of the car and some
glue to make it the whole way.  I will paint it so the glue will not
show.  I know this is alot of rambling for a little info but I'm not
fully awake yet.  Let me know what other ideas you come up with.  Happy
Holidays  Bill S.
