	As was mentioned by both Dirk and JJ, you can change them in a 914
without dropping the motor.
	When I replaced mine in my 914, I pulled off the valve covers (one
side at a time) and removed the rocker assemblies.  I left the heat ex-
changers on, but did have to pull off some of the ducting that goes below
them.  I used the shop-rag-and-vise-grips approach like JJ.  A word of
caution:  Wear BIG HEAVY gloves when you do this.  I was wearing just the
thin latex gloves, and when the first tube came out I really mashed a
couple of my fingers.  After a few band-aids, I put on the leather work
gloves, which protect a lot better.
	With the rocker assemblies out, you can pull the tube out far
enough to change both inner and outer seals.  The middle of the tube is
still going through the head at this point, but the ends are free.  If the
pushrod itself stays in the lifter when you pull the tube out, then pull
it out to where the tube is.
	Clean everything as much as you can, and lube the new Viton seals
(JJ is right--Vtion lasts a lot longer than the stock silicone seals)
with engine oil or silicone lube.  NOT silicone seal--though at least one
person insists that the only way he got his seals to work is by gooping
the heck out of everything with silicone sealer...
	Putting the rocker assemblies back *is* a PITA with the engine in
the car, but it *is* doable.  I found the toughest part for me was making
sure that the pushrods were seated correctly in the lifters.  It was
easier (for me) to make sure of that when that particular cylinder was at
TDC, so the valves were "slack".
	Of course, a valve adjust is necessary afterwards.

>Is this a symptom of switching to synthetic oil?

	It is possible.  Synthetic oil is "slipperier" than dino juice, and
can exacerbate a leak where one already exists.  If your seals were leaking
slowly enough that you might not notice, a switch to synthetic might just
make them leak enough to notice.
	However, this is a known problem with Type IV motors, and with
Volksies in general.  (Also 911 motors.)  Happily, unlike the Type I/II/III/
356 and 911 motors, we *don't* have to remove the heads to replace the
pushrod tube (or oil return tube, for the 911) seals.  Both of my 914s
developed pushrod tube seal leaks, and both were fixed.  No more leaks yet.

>Overfilling the motor with oil- which I do (a bit) to compensate for low
>oil pressure light flickering?

	As Dirk said, overfilling may not help the flickering.  If the light
flickers at idle when warm, that is normal for an old, tired motor.  If you
get the light on in hard cornering and/or braking, overfilling by about 1/2
quart is good.  An oil trap or deep sump is better--but it's still good to
overfill by 1/2 qt.
	Overfilling will *not* lead to oil leaks, unless you put a *lot*
more oil in than the "full" mark.

>Your suggestions, comments, and advice are really welcome!!

	HD oil pumps are something of a crapshoot.  They can be OK for a
stock motor, but they aren't really necessary if you don't have an exter-
nal oil cooler.  Some say maybe not even then, but I'm not yet convinced
either way.  Some of them leak, and there's not a lot to do about it.
Some of them require some "modification" to fit correctly.  The higher-
pressure spring on the oil pressure relief piston may help some with the
flickering oil light.  It doesn't seem to be a bad thing for any other
reasons--so it might help, and it won't hurt.
	A deep sump or oil trap will help a little bit on the hot running.
It gives you more oil, which means the oil can absorb more heat from the
motor.  It also gives you more surface area to radiate the heat.  That's
also good.  But they may not be adequate, particularly if your car has
thermal reactors on it.  If it does, DITCH THEM NOW!  These nasty things
will cook your motor.
	Make sure your ignition timing and mixture are both correct.  If
they're off (too advanced timing, too lean mixture) the car will run hot.
Make sure the cooling system is up to snuff; make sure the flaps inside
the ducting (the ones controlled by the thermostat) are in place.  For
Italy, it's a good idea to keep the T-stat hooked up--it gets cold enough
there that you'll want the motor to warm up correctly.  Make sure your fan
is not missing any blades.  Make sure that your engine sheetmetal seals
correctly where it should.  Make sure all the holes through it are sealed
correctly--particularly spark plug holes, the head temp sensor hole, and
the timing mark inspection hole.
	Finally, if you're still running too hot, consider adding an ex-
ternal oil cooler.  Nose-mounted is preferred, but the right-front fender
well is a popular option for 911s.  Get one with a fan, and see if you can
duct air to it somehow.

	Do you have the stock-type instrumentation (no numbers), or do you
have gauges with numbers in them to tell you how hot and what your oil
pressure is?  Aftermarket gauges for oil temp and pressure are not that
hideously expensive, and can tell you some of what's going on inside your
motor.
