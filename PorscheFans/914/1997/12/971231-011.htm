	I have a Long Version (and a Really Long version) of some
arguments about hydraulic lifters.  The short version goes:
	Stan Hanks was dead-set against them.  I think that he used
them on one motor, and then someone did a "normal" valve adjust on the
motor, which blew up in pretty short order.  (You can't tell from the
outside that the lifters are hydraulic--you you *ALWAYS* have to tell
anyone who works on the car that they are.)
	He then looked into the engineering behind the hydraulic cam
setups, and decided that nobody had done any engineering to make sure
that the VW Bus Type IV setup (which is basically what we're talking
about) works correctly in a 914.  The motors are very similar, but they
are not identical.
	So Stan decided that they were a Bad Thing.

	RD Rick has them in (at least one of) his 914s, and loves the
heck out of them.  The motor has something like 30K on it by now, and
has (from what we've heard) had no cam- or valve-related problems.  And
it goes right up to 6000 RPM just fine.
	So RD decided that they were a Good Thing.

	When I had my motor rebuilt, I gave lots of credence to anything
that Stan said.  (Well, most of it.)  So I didn't go hydraulic.  I don't
regret the decision, but I've now done about a zillion valve adjusts.
Unless I find out something compelling, I won't put hydraulic lifters
into any of my own motors.

	Dirk was right, by the way.  "Just drive the car, Dirk!"  Drive
it until you need to open up the case, then decide if you want the stock
or hydraulic lifters as part of your overhaul process.
