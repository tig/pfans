To all Dutchies on the list (and I know you are out there somewhere=85),

I'm looking for some (first hand) info or experiences with Dutch Porsche
Clubs. Our P-family on the other side of the big ocean seem to have a lot
more fun than we do overhere (driver's ed., club-racing, autocrossing
etc.). I've visited the PCA Northstern region last summer and they had to=
ns
of fun at the track! They really got me jealous and I wanna get some
track-fun too=85 after all, the way the police is checking now a days it'=
s
not much fun on the public roads anymore (been to court for a speeding
ticket earlier this year and I can tell you it's definitely NOT funny =96
driving 110km (or  70mi) to fast). Our once-a-year day at the
Zandvoort-track organized by Pon (the Dutch P-importer) is usually
overcrowded (over 100 cars) and I wasn't much impressed by snobs cruising
their brand new cars along the track while using their mobile phones eith=
er
(look mom, no hands=85 look mom, no brains!).
So, does any of you cheeseheads on this list know of a club where I can g=
et
me some real adrenaline-rushes (there must be something else to do with o=
ur
Porsches than cruising along the wind mills on Sunday afternoon 8^)?

Let me know if you know=85

Hey Jeff, mabey we ought to put a club together or get another list going on
the porschefans for people like us.  lol

And why only 15min??  I spend 30min on my motor cycle that sits in the kitchen
and 30 in the 914 that sits in the garage.  I couldnt get both the bike and
the porsche in the kitchen at the same time.  lol  Whoever mentioned that one
needs a 3 car garage and a attached house,,,,,,,Whoo ra for him, he nailed it
right on the money.

TO MIKE MASTROCOVO.  THE 914 V8

Purist may frown, but every one else will awww.  Trust me, i have a Mazda
Rotary in my 73 914.  I wouldnt have it any other way!   Other than turbos are
on the way when the money is here.

REGARDING DIONS BOOK
another good book, and most will probably allready know this.  PORSCHE--WHEN
EXELLENCE WAS EXPECTED.  The 914 section is aprox 101 pages and contains infor
on the porformance of the 70 914-6 and the 73-74 914-4 2.0 liter.  The book is
not easy to find and runs about 110 dollars last time i checked.  This is to
my knolege the most indepth book about porsche that i have ever seen, almost
900 pages total.
