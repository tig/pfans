Well, the dismantling of my *new* (well, it's new to me) '75 914 is going
really well.  Front suspension is out, the interior is partially gutted, and
the engine/transmission will be dis-gorged this evening. (My 911, in the
next garage stall, has a severe look of panic in it's headlights as I gut
the 914 - probably thinks it's turn is next...)

So much for the progress report. Now I need some technical advice, so here
goes..  Due to the SCCA CSP rules, I want to backdate to a '74 1.8 SSI
setup.  Is this a "bolt - on" retrofit? (the cat will not be re-installed
from the '75.)  Also, will any year 1.7/1.8 muffler fit to the '74 SSI's?
Any help/guidance/advice would be welcomed as I found a couple of different
sets on SSI's ('74 & '75) on the Internet "used" market - but not sure of
which to go for...

Finally - I'm getting rid of all that weight hanging out at the end of the
car - the '75 bumpers...  Does anyone know if the '73 or '74 bumpers will
attach without major body mods?

Thanks in advance,

John Dunkle
