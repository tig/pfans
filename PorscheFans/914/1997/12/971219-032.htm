	You're right, Dirk--you don't know.  The extra oil lines are a bit
of an annoyance (and you can't correctly route them on the very early 2.0
motors).  However, as far as was known about three years ago, the Carrera
tensioners do not fail.  *ALL* of the mechanical ones eventually do.  You
don't adjust them, they are not adjustable.  Eventually they wear out and
fail.  The later ones tend to last longer than the earlier ones, but they
still fail.  You can put a collar on them to keep them from collapsing
entirely, but they still collapse.
	There are solid "tensioners" available for racing applications, but
they are usually not recommended even in those cases.  The 911 motor, like
so many others, expands when it heats up.  The mostly aluminum motor expands
more than the steel chain.  The tensioners take up this slack when the oil
and the motor are cool, and then give it back when the motor and the oil
are warm.  This action needs to happen, or you have lots of chain slap when
the engine is cold (which leads to failure of SOMETHING eventually) or you
have the chain too tight when warm, which leads to Bad News in a BIG hurry.
	When a chain tensioner fails, often you lose the entire bank of
cylinders that it was servicing.  The chain skips by a tooth or two or
more, and then pistons meet valves.  Not pretty.  I know two people who
have lunched 911 motors that way.  I also know someone who had a tensioner
fail in a fashion that only made the engine more noisy.  He drove it for
the rest of the day, then replaced both tensioners.  I don't know if it was
the fact that he had a newer motor than the first two above (it was an 80
SC), or if he simply got lucky.  I personally woudn't want to take a risk
with a motor that is that expensive.
	From what I have heard and read, practically the only time that the
Carrera tensioners fail is if they're fed oil with crap in it, or if the oil
lines get bent and break.
	Oil may indeed thin out when warm--but the designers of the engine
know this even better than you do.  It is just possible that they either
counted on that fact, or made allowances for it.

	I haven't looked into this subject in the past three or four years,
so my info may be out of date.  However, ALL the 911 motors made for 1984
and later years have had the hydraulic Carrera chain tensioners.  This may
lead one to the conclusion that Porsche thinks that they work better than
the older-style ones.
