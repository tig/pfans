Hi All, Merry Christmas, 
Well hope everyone got a Porsche part under the tree ?? If you did, tell
us about it. In fact someone's wife was looking for GT Flares...Anyone
get Flares for xmas ??

No parts for me, but I did get Brian longs new book under the tree,
suprise !! she (the wife) dose listen after all. I was putting off
ordering it until you guys got yours since I knew it was back ordered.
Anyway I spent an hour just lookin at the pics, cant wait till I have a
little time to read it. From what I have seen, I would say buy if you
have the funds, its great !...
Take Care, 
 Don
