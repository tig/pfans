For what application? Just for looks? For peice of mind? For racing or
competition application? If you intend on doing it for safety, then just
cough up the couple hundred bucks for a full cage from one of the
numerous suppliers. They're cheap and very reliable.

How skilled of a welder are you? Been welding for many many years? There
is a reason that many clubs DO NOT allow welded-in cages. Welds are only
as good as the person who did the welding, while bolts are considered a
basic standars that can be counted on. I know someone who whelded up a
cage for a buggy that he made. He was very proud of the result. And it
looked beatiful, right up untill the first hard bump the chassis took.
Remeber the Blues Mobile from The Blues Brothers? Every single weld
broke right then and there, the tubes just went clattering everywhere.
He was glad he was wearing a helmet. Just because a weld can hold two
pieces of metal together doesn't mean it'll save your life.

Then just get an autopower or other such manufacturers cage. Your body
and brain will thank you if you ever have need for it. Prcatice building
your own, no big deal, do it a number of times. Subject it to stress
tests etc. and pretty soon you'd want what's already available I'll bet.
