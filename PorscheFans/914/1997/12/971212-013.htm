As Dirk said (12-10 posting) POR 15 is an
Isocyanate and is poisonous.  Well, I did
some checking and got an MSDS on the 
major component of POR 15:
4,4'-methylenebis(phenyl isocyanate).
This is not only poisonous but also a 
mutagen, y'know.... 3 legged kids kinda
stuff.  So, as with all chemicals, do not use
without proper personal safety equipment
including: a respirator (that fits YOU) with organic vapor/ 
acid gas canisters, latex gloves, goggles (goggles
today let you ogle tomorrow) and clothing you
don't mind throwing away.  And of course, the all
important.... use in a well ventillated area.
SAFETY FIRST, enjoyment of your project second!!

ps.  If anyone thinks that the FREE advice given on 
this list is wrong or could be harmful, at least have the 
decency to post a differing opinion (it doesn't  have to 
be in the form of a flame) that could help someone
save a little time, money or injury.  had to say it.
