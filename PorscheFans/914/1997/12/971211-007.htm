	You will need to remove all the interior pieces that surround the
window.  The seats will also be in your way, so remove them.  They are
easy, as is the upholstery against the firewall.  (Remove the four big
screws, pull the bottom part forward, slide the rest downward.)  Remove
the top seatbelt mounts, and the little hooks above them.  I think the
side pieces come off the Targa bar at that point.
	The padding on the top part of the Targa bar is a pain.  Remove
all the plastic plugs, and use a Phillips-head screwdriver on the screw
that lives in each hole.  After you get them all out, check for more.
Once you're SURE they're all out, the piece slides forward.
	To remove the window, you will need to cut the stuff that seals
it to the frame.  I wound up using a utility knife.  It took quite a
while.  If there is excess sealer that has oozed out of the seam, use
the knife to cut that away first.  I didn't, and that was a mistake.
	You may be able to use a wire to cut through the seam.  I broke
the wires I used, and put some ugly marks in the paint near one part of
the window.  YMMV.
	Once the seal is cut, the bottom of the window tips inward, and
the window slides downward.  Don't let it fall too far or it will break.

	GPR sells some good stuff for holding the window in.  They may
also have your body parts for a pretty good price.  Also try Doc and Cy's.
