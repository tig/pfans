I have an idea of where to put an external oil cooler. How about in the
forward part of the passenger side fender well? The 911's put one up in the
front right fender well with a protective cover on it. It could be put there
also, but the rear fender well is obviously closer. 

Also, on the subject of oil tanks, has anyone considered fabricating one
into the driver's side rear fender well? What I mean is to create a cavity
in there by welding in sheetmetal and sealing it. Use the outer fender and
the inner engine bay sheet metal as 2 of the walls for the tank. You'd have
to repaint the fender and the inner bulkhead of course. It's an idea for a
creative welder anyway.
