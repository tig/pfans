Well, I did a test last night on the heads and discovered that at least some
of the guides are very worn. What I did was to turn the engine over by hand
without spark plugs installed so that one of the valves was just off of it's
seat. I then took a large screwdriver and attempted to pry the stem
sideways. One of the intakes moved a lot, some of the others moved only a
little. So, it's new guides time at chez 914. I'm gonna do it myself, so I
need a bunch of tools (this could be good!), and I'm going to be inducted
into the home auto mechanic's guild, since I'm going to be using at least 3
large kitchen appliances for this job. I'm going to use the dishwasher, the
freezer and the oven. Gotta wait until the wife is away, she hates stinky stuff.

So, are the valve guides and springs the same as the VW Type IV? Can I go to
a VW supplier and save a few pennies? Do I need to cut the seats when I
replace the guides, or can I just lap them??? Should I get really serious
about cc'ing the combustion chambers? It's a good thing I bought that VW
motor rebuilding book last week, what perfect timing. Looks like I have
something to read in the bathroom now :)

I'm thinking about doing a ceramic coating on parts of the head and valves.
Anyone have experience with this?

Also, I have one loose exhaust stud. When the PO removed the exhaust, one of
the nuts stuck to a stud and inscrewed with the nut. Instead of separating
the stud from the nut (or getting a new stud), the idiot just screwed the
whole thing back into the head. What this did was wear out the aluninum
threads a little, thus making any stud screwed in there loose. I bought some
steel inserts, but they are no tighter when I screw one onto a stud. I was
thinking of maybe using JB weld on the worn threads, letting it cure, then
running a tap to recut the threads. Does this sound like a reasonable
solution? Does JB weld stick good to aluminum? Is it extremely heat
resistant?? Otherwise, I could get a longer steel insert (the ones I bought
are 10mm long) and a longer stud and use locktight. I have the drill and tap
for the inserts (EZ-LOK). 

Finally, the trick to getting stuck steel studs out is to weld a nut on
them. The heat from welding gets soaked into the head, making them more
likey to bust loose. You let the nut cool a little, then put a tool on it.
The nut of course allows you to but a small impact gun on them, which are
better than a regular wrench.
