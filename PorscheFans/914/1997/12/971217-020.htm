Subject: 914: GT flare wheel width question

Question to all of you with GT Flares:

<        I am now planning on GT flares for my CSP autoxer, but the
comment
about only 7" wheels fitting up front bothers me. 

Josh, I've seen pictures in magazines of 914s with stock front wheelwells
and 8 inch wheels. Front wheelwells aren't the problem.


<        Secondly, regarding oil cooler locations. I remember seeing a
rear
spoiler mounted oil cooler on a 914 once. Was that you Ferguson? And
would like to hear any pros and cons about that mounting location. This
is for an engine oil cooler, not tranny. I know, I know, mount it in
front. But the rules in my class prohibit me from cutting sheet metal,
and I don't feel comfortable hanging it out in front of the bumper for
road debris (or high speed cones) to whack it around.

I think the solution to this problem is to run the cooler in the engine
compartment with a fan. Mount it above the tin and cut the tin so the air
can escape under the car and build duct around the cooler. SCCA rules
allow modifications to the shroud.
