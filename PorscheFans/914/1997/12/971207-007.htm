Hi all, 
 Well I just dont know what to do ??? For two days Ive had over 200
emails in my email box (and growing, 272 for sunday), which is about the
same for the last few day with the cheesehead guy thing. Up until Friday
night I had down loaded all this and deleted them, Im not mad at him cuz
I how how it happened, but I wish the members of the lists knew this ??
Im sure the word has gotten around by now ?? or you would think.

Ok the problem; I go to "GET" mail and it thinks for a long time (10
minutes) and then very slowly it starts to down load (about 25 min
total), when it done downloading I get maybe 38 messages and then says I
have mail ?? I went to the Archives and there is something there (12/6)
and it just ////////// over and over, could this be screwing up my
mailer ?? What can I do ?? 
If anyone responds or thinks they can help, I will be checking the
Archives, since I cant read what up any other way right now.

Thanks, 
 Don
