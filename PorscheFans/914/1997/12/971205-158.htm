OK, I'll go.

I live just west of Washington, DC. I work for the patent office. I've been
there for 15 years. I decide who gets a patent in the transmission field. I
got married in June and I have a 9 year old daughter from a previous
marriage. She lives with her mother in Texas.

After I got my 914 back from the body guy last winter, I put it into
storage. We used a Hyundai as our only car until about february, when I
bought a '71 2002. I bought the car because my wife likes them. We looked
at several, and they all were rusty. The Hyundai was becoming unrelaible,
so I bought the 2002 in a panic. I learned that doing that is a very bad
thing to do. Anyway, I continued to work on both cars until I finally gave
up on the Hyundai around May. We sold it in June sometime for about 1600$,
and I started looking at Porsche 912's. I figured my wife would be happy
with the 2002. I was wrong. She wanted a Bavaria. They were such a bargin
compared to the porsches that I decided that it was more affordable to get
the bimmer. I bought a really nice bavaria for 1500$ in July.

In the time I've had the 2002, I've replaced/repaired the following: new
weber carb and used ported manifold, new distributor/pertronix/msd, new
alternator and water pump, used differential, new CV bolts, all new brakes,
2 new tires, and several misc. items. The car is now at the bodyshop
getting healed of rust and dents. I have new carpeting and other things to
put on the car. I'm helping the body man a little and trying not to get in
the way too much.

The 914 is still in storage without a drivetrain. I decided that it is so
nice (no accidents, original good paint, no serious rust), that I needed to
completely go over the car and rust proof/paint the hidden areas with
surface rust. Over the summer, I replaced the rear wheel bearings and
painted the rear suspension. I got the rear Koni shocks rebuilt and painted
every little part including the springs, perches, trailing arms, brackets,
hubs, etc. It looks nice now. I re-painted the driver's side floor because
I did a poor job the first time. The rust came back. I completely sealed
every stinking seam in the engine compartment with caulk and painted the
caulk. I sprayed wax into every little drain hole I could find. I took both
bumpers off and stripped the parts off and cleaned/painted/rustproofed the
body behind the bumpers. I resealed the tail lights. I used a black bumper
restoring dye on the bumper covers. I put seam seal on every seam on the
driver's side floor. I've started on the front suspension. I installed rack
spacers and I bought used early 911 "M" calipers for the front. I bought a
set of pedrinnis. I bought a whole bunch of used parts locally. I cleaned
and repacked all 4 CV joints and painted the axles. I pulled the cylinder
heads and started replacing the exhaust studs, got stuck. I shipped the
transmission up to massechusites, but got it canceled due to a divorce.

On the bavaria, I bought a set of oem alloy wheels and striped and painted
them. This was very time intensive. I bought a set of conti super contact
tires for the car. Also, I bought a set of brake pads and replaced most of
the flex lines with braided SS ones. I took the car to my body man and had
him re-weld the parking brake support, which had busted off because no
previous owner was bright enough to realize that the drum parking brakes
have adjusters, so they continued to yank very hard on the handle. I
thoroughly rustproofed the car, including much scraping and sanding and
painting the fender wells and underside. I sprayed cosmoline weathershed
into every little body cavity hole I could find. I replaced the rear
differential mount. I bought used 530i rear springs, then put the original
sagging springs back in after I took the 3/4" spacers out of the front
suspension. The spacers were installed by BMW to raise the front of the car
to meet federal bumper and headlight standards. With the 530i springs in
the back and the spacers out of the front the rear of the car was jacked up
way too high, so I lowered the back by putting the old springs back in. I
bought a set of used 530i sway bars, which are thicker. They haven't
arrived yet. I've done a bunch of misc. things to this car also.

My daughter visited us for a couple of weeks over the summer and she's
coming up for christmas.

Last christmas, I learned that both my mother and father have written me
out of thier wills. My mother passed away in the spring.
