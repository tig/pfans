	OK.  Next time it dies, check the fuel pressure.  (Do you have
the gauge hooked up all the time?  I do, and discovered an intermittent
fuel pump problem because of it.)  If you have no pressure, then your
pump circuit is malfunctioning.  Bridge the #30 and #87 terminals on
the fuel pump relay with a piece of wire.  (#30 is to "top" one, the
one a little farther from both its neighbors than the others.  Power
comes in to that one.  #87 is the output to the pump, it's the lower-
left one.)  If the pump runs then, you have some bad circuitry either
in the relay board, or coming from the brain, or...  Wherever the other
part of that signal comes from.  Check the Fuel Pump guide in the Tech
Refs section of Tim's 914 Fan Page <http://www.estinc.com/porsche> for
details.
	If you do still have fuel pressure, check for a spark from the
coil.  Using rubber-handled pliers, hold the spark plug end of one of
the plug wires about 1/4" from ground.  Have someone crank the motor.
If you have no spark, your ignition system is faulty somewhere.
	If you have a spark, and you have fuel pressure, and you have
a fuel smell coming out of your tailpipe, it's possible that the hot
resistance of the Head Temp Sensor is out of spec.  You mentioned that
you checked this sensor, but you didn't mention if you checked warm as
well as cold.  If it stays at 2K-3K ohms when warm, that will stall
the motor at a hot idle.

	Those are the most immediate suspects.
