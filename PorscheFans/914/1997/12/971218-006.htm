I am not an owner YET.  I am joining you folks because I am a BIG fan of German 
Toys ( I own two 2002 BMWs) and am interested in my future as a 914 owner.
Also, my friend jsut got a 1.7 and has no computer access so I am in it for him 
as well.  So my first quesion is:
Anybody in the eastern PA area got a rough condition 914 that they would trade 
for a pair of 2002s that need to be restored?  Or have you got a really good 
deal on a "needy" 914 that I could afford to buy by selling my 2002s?
Please let me know!!!!
