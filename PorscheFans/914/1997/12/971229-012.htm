Hello all,
I hope you had a good holiday.

An Idea I have been toying with (only sort of seriously) is swapping the 
throttle body from a 3 liter Mercedes (or something else with a D-jet and 
slightly larger displacement) over to a 2 liter 914.  Is this simply not 
worth thinking about?  Why do it?  Presumably better flow.  Also, it 
would be nice to find a throttle body that has a throttle stop screw 
since the lack of one on the 914 is a cause for rough operation (at least 
it is on mine).  The throttle switch should be compatible.  The MPS 
should be able to compensate for the extra flow... maybe.  Need to alter 
the airbox (??) and the filter housing would have to change.  So, has 
anyone done this or heard of this?
