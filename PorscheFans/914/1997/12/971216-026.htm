Hello p-fans,

Season's Greetings to everyone.  I'm Brian Ng, 25, from Vancouver BC,
recently engaged to Caroline Chin.  The big date is set for middle of
August, 98 :)).  The reason she puts up with my p-car addiction is because I
got
her hooked on autocrossing in the 914.


We bought our current 73 914 for $1200 CDN (about $850 USF) with a broken
engine.  I promptly installed a used 2.0, new KYBs, tires, etc, and built up
a budget B/Stock car.  The two of us campaigned #14 in the BFG/Novice Series
this season, with our sights set on winning one of 6 sets of R1 tires.
Well, we did win, and look forewards to autoX events next season, with a
fresh stock engine.  You can find out more about our car at
http://www.skyinternet.ca/~brianng/p914.html

I've been lurking again on the list for a while, ever since the '14 has been
parked for winter.  We parked the little car immediately after the last
autocross at the end of October, so that we would have something left of the
engine to rebuild.  We ran the car hard all season--the engine had been
tired since July or so, but we hoped to win tires on this engine.  Just in
case, I had already cleaned up a spare case, and rebuild a spare pair of
heads.  I had enough parts to do a 2-day engine removal, rebuild, and
re-installation if necessary.  Thankfully, I now have all winter to do a
proper balance and blue-printing session at work, and should have a spare
engine to rebuild too.  I'd love to do a real performance/race build on this
engine, but with the wedding plans for next year, we won't have the funds to
make this into a competitive SP car.

Oh, speaking of work, I build fast cars for a living at Momentum Motorsport,
a speed shop in Port Moody, (604) 469-FAST {requisite plug}.  Lots of
fun stuff at work:  98 M3 supercharged, Lotus S4, and lots of VWs.  My boss,
Shawn Van Neer, was the first person to put a VR6 engine into a Mk 1 GTI,
back when we were both working for Ron's Parts.   What a fun, fast car.

My current personal VW project is a 1977 Rabbit 2.0.  The engine,
transmission, and engine management will come from a current Golf Mk3,
complete with EFI.  Add a Schrick 276 cam, headers, chip and head massaging
to make this 1800# car into a nice 140hp Q ship.  Prepared class for sure,
maybe Modified, but fun on the street.   Right now, I'm doing non-structural
floorboard rust repairs on the passenger side of the shell, and gathering
parts for the car.  A car to make Mk1 lovers grin from ear to ear.


When I'm not busy playing with cars, I like to climb at the local climbing
gym, go mountain biking, or skiing.  I am also an active Rover Scout,
working as a Scouter in the Troop.

Merry Christmas,

Brian Ng
