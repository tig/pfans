	I don't know how this could possibly happen.  I've thought and
thought about it, and I still can't see it.  It doesn't make a lot of
sense to me.  However, I am not prepared to accept that it *cannot* hap-
pen just because I can't see how it could.  I have had two knowledgeable
people tell me that it can, and I have seen one example that tells me
that it *might*.

	That is why I mentioned this point.  I wanted to give everyone
all the info I could, and let them make their own decision.

	Very true, especially if you can lift both sides of the car and
block the rear wheel on one side.  I lift one side of the car at a time,
and let the ground block the other wheel.  In fact, I also remove the
wheel on the side I am working on, to give me better access to the tops
of the valves.
	I marked the flywheel while the engine was out of the car.  I
do not think it is necessary to have it out, but that was when I did it.
Now that the painting is done, there is no extra effort on my part.
	Since I have a stock motor, I figure that I'll follow the pro-
cdure laid out in the manuals.  If I see what I consider a compelling
reason to change, I will--but I'm used to this particular method, and I
have (just a little) more confidence in it.  I know that the only reason
I have to be at all confident is "because the book says so", which is
sometimes not a very good reason.

	As I said, I'm just trying to provide info so people can make
an informed decision.  If it's your own car, you make the choices and
deal with both the good ones and the bad ones.

	Ouch!  I wondered if you had gotten that Incredible Changing
Valve Clearance problem figured out.  Hmm...  If I remember correctly,
the lifters (tappets) are pretty cheap.  Maybe you could buy one or two
and install them in place of the damaged one(s)? It wouldn't solve your
problem like a teardown and overhaul, but it would hopefully give you
more consistent clearance.
	Hmm, then again it might accelerate the wear on the cam.  Ugh--
maybe it's not the best idea in the world.   8^(
