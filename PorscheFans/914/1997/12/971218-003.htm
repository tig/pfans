Here's the deal from someone who has actually done a couple of
conversions (thanks Rich)...

First, depending on the mounts used (crossbar or center mount) the shift
bar *might* have to be changed (elongated or straightened) assuming the
original 901 tranny is left in place (the 915 requires a changed bar).
More specifically, here are some details as I understand them:

The center mount allows the bar to be straightened (better shifting) and
most installers cut the ends from their current bar and weld a new
"straight" piece into the middle.  Actually, to get a better fit, it is
possible to slightly bend it (~4 degrees) so mates with the transmission
coupler absolutely straight.  Individual installations might be
different depending on which brand of headers are used or whether heat
exchangers are used.

Bar mounts typically require that the shift bar either run over the bar
or under the bar (not through the bar like the 914/4 mount).  Depending
on brands, this might require an extra length to be installed to go
around the bar and/or headers/exchangers. Also, while the Patrick design
apparently allows the standard length bar, it too, (as Steve noted in
his post) might need to be turned depending on the exhaust components
used.

In either case, for a Porsche 6 installation, the tranny mount points
will stay the same.

Hope this helps clear up the confusion - when I *actually* do my
conversion, I'll post to the list what had to be done to what. Hope
others do the same (Nick?)....
