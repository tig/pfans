I've been thinking about the same thing.  My PO had made one out of sheet
metal since the front mounted oil cooler inhibited the use of the stock one.
It was painted with a rubberized undercoating, and it held up pretty well
and looked fairly nice.  The only problem was that after driving around on
the street for a while, its very limited clearance (about 2 inches) caused
it to get battered and smashed, so now I'm without a valance as well.  I've
been thinking about making one, but I haven't had a chance to investigate.
I was thinking that if I could find fairly thick flexible black plastic, I
could bolt it on where the old one had been.  It would allow me to do brake
ducting, and if I so desired, portions could be reinforced with metal to
allow the installation of additional driving lights.  The plastic I'm
thinking of I've only seen once.  It was used in a gardening application to
help separate a section of grass from a gravel walkway.  It was about 2
millimeters thick, about 5 inches high, and was available in lengths of
about 12 feet.  It had a curled "lip" on one side to enhance appearance and
increase rigidity.  I think this would work perfect, but until I get a
chance to look around for it again, I can't be certain.  Let me know if you
come up with a good solution.

Thanks,
