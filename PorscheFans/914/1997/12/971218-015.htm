This is where it gets a bit weird (like it wasn't already).  I took the car
to my mechanic, and we hooked it up to an exhaust gas analyzer.  As the idle
fluctuated between 500 and 2000 RPM, the CO fluctuated between 1.5 and 3.0,
and the HC PPM fluctuated between 200 and 1800.  The thing that's killing me
right now is that 1800 PPM HC reading.  If I can get that down to under 400
(shouldn't be a problem, I've heard plenty of 914 owners claiming very tiny
HC readings) and get plates for the car, then I'll be a much happier man!
Nonetheless, I don't suppose it could hurt to hook a potentiometer in line
with the head temp sensor to see if it has a positive effect.  I can always
remove it and be back to where I am now!

Thanks for the advice,
