The new Auto Atlanta catalog is the best I have seen. Please note that this
catalog covers all PORSCHE. The exclusive AA 914 catalog is yet to come.
George and staff have done a good job. Read the ads and you will see some
914 parts that are offered, such as parts to repair the fabled door handle
for $45.
George loves the 914 and offers many items you will not see anywhere else.
You don't have to buy from AA. If you don't like a resource to keep your 914
original, then go somewhere else to shop. As for me, when I have the money,
I will buy my new 914 parts from the guy who has helped more than anyone on
earth to keep these babies from  the junk yards of the world.
Mine is not a race car, but one which is used for my personal enjoyment as
it was intended since the 1st one in April, 1970.
Thanks George.
