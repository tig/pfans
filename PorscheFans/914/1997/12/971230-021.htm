245s will be a bit pinched on an 8 inch rim and I'd rather run a 225 at
that point.

The offset of the factory fuchs is the same on an 8 inch rim as a 9 inch
rim. But the 9 inch rim (wider) will apparently rub the tire on teh
fender wall if 245s are mounted on it. Yes, a 9 factory 9 inch rim will
fit fine with 225s though.

I'm currently running on BFG R1s, but may switch to Hoosiers at some
point, especially if I move up to the 245s. Wider is only better if you
can get the tires up to temperature. That's my main concern about
running 245 tires. The 914 is not that heavy of a car, and may not be
able to get enough heat into tires that wide to make 'em really stick.
If that's really the case, then I'll run 225s. But Hoosier has a softer
compounded tire that tends to heat up more easilly.

What kind of classes are you going to be running in? If you're selecting
street tires to compete with when you've got really wide rims, you may
not be competetive. Because most clubs will bump you up if you run
wheels that are appreciably wider than stock. Remember, before you buy
go-fast goodies, read the rules. If you're just going for fun, and
budget is not too much of concern, then the AVS is a great tire. I ran
it, and liked it alot, but I didn't think that it was worth the extra
money over the A509. However, I didn't race on them either. I race on
race tires ona second set of rims. And street use for this particular
914 is becoming rather limited.
