245s will fit on 9 inch rims in the rear, but they must be a custom
backspacing. 5.5" backspacing I believe will allow that much tire in the
rear.

My idea is to have 245/50(or 45)-15 tires on 9 inch rims all the way
around. I run 225s right now and I don't think the steering effort is
terribly difficult at all. I think if I were to go to slicks that'd be a
different story, but I'm still going to be running DOT race rubber. But
this car is seeing less and less of the public roads, and more and more
of the race track and autox fields only. So navigating in the paddock is
really the only challenge. Granted, I havn't run really long track
events yet, and it's possible that long term fatigue might be  a factor
with increased steering effort. But 225s will fit on 9 inch rims just as
easilly as 245s, so I can always go down a size if need be.

 Will they fit with 8 inch rims? Is the offset of the 8 inch rim the problem?
I think that I am going to use 225's on all 4 corners this time. If there is
enough room left in the wheelwell with the 225's, I'll try 245's next tire
change. My car will be used for PCA autocrossing, track events and street. I
am considering using Yokohama's AVS or A032's. Any suggestions? What brand do
you run?
Thanks,
Ed Villela
