My name is Mike Gensler.  I live in San Antonio, TX, am 33 years old,
married, NO kids (Yeah).

I bought my first (and so far only) Porsche in 1991.  It made a lovely
utility shelf in my garage until Spring of 1994 when I vowed that I
would either drive the thing around the block by the 4th of July or I
would sell it.

On July 4th, I fired it up.  No muffler, enough smoke for a dozen
disco-techs, but it started and I did indeed drive it around the block
(probably much to my neighbors' annoyance).  Anyway, since then I've
removed the engine twice - once to install new P&C and the other time to
have some head work done.  I had the transmission rebuilt, have replaced
any brake and suspension parts that needed replacement and installed
some re-upholstered seats and new carpet.  Now it is a very reliable,
fun-to-drive car.

I drive the car as daily transportation and autocross it as often as I
can.  My wife won first in I-1L at the 97 Parade (I only got 5th in
I-1M) and we were the ONLY car running on street rubber with a stock
swaybar!

My other vehicles include my wife's Nissan Maxima (it starts and runs
EVERYtime you get in it), my 73 VW Westfalia camper (which takes us
camping at least 6 times a year and makes several 1000+ mile trips each
year), and my newly acquired 58 VW single cab pickup (you want to talk
about getting STARED at).

Happy Holidays to all.

Mike g.
