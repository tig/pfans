The H & H one also looks like a cinch to build if you have something
like a Hossfeldt (sp?) edge bender and can cut the lengths you need.

H & H bar doesn't require this.

Before I found H & H's address, I took measurements/photos of an example
to a local shop for an estimate. By the time I bought the coupler and
steel, had things cut/bent/painted, and got together the hardware, I
wasn't saving much.  Plus, don't we want as many shops like H & H as
possible to continue to operate into the 2000s? How many guys are still
building stuff for our cars (okay, okay, on the Right coast, at least).

Brian, If you still want to try building one, or if you just want to see
what mine looks like, I'll fax you a picture/plan. Also, have you
considered a dolly? I went this route because I don't have a tow vehicle
substantial enough for dolly and car; advantage is if you tow the 914
butt first (it can be done, right?), your tranny isn't spinning the
whole time, as with the bar.

Good luck!
Thwen.
