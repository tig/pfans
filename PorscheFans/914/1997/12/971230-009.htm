This is surely going to get me a flame, but here, I say it.
The true gist of the 914 in competition is really the skill of the driver,
the suspension, a fined tuned engine and just being lucky. 
All the extreme mods do is mostly swell heads and put many genuine 914s on
the future list for junk yards. Actually makes them worth less in most cases.
I hear a lot of love for these Porsche breed and at the same time destroying
them with half ass ideas and wild modifications. If you want to really enjoy
these cars, keep them well tuned, do regular maintenance, necessary repairs
and leave it as Porsche designed them with few rare exceptions. Race in
these and it will show your real driving skills and not how large your ego
or pocketbook is.
