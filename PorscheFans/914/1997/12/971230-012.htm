   I just want to be sure that we are in agreement as to what my
procedure calls for; the valve that would be rocking in the case you
mention would not be the intake valve of the same cylinder, but the
EXHAUST valve of the OPPOSITE cylinder.

   I would like a more detailed explanation of how this could be... a
camshaft lobe consists of two geometrical figures (in simplified
terms): a circle, and a triangle.   For most of it's rotation
(assuming that the camshaft is in good shape) the follower is riding
on the circle, and the valve train geometry is static... the only
change that could result in a clearance change is the degree of
out-of-roundness or roughness of the cam itself.***     For the rest
of the rotation, of course, the triangular-shaped portion of the cam
drives the valve open.
   The more radical the cam, the more the "triangle" departs from
that shape, and the smaller the arc on the back of the cam that
remains circular.  For this reason, to avoid having to take into
account cam grind parameters, the standard place to measure valve
clearance is on the part of the cam EXACTLY opposite to the peak of
the lobe.  
   In a DOHC engine this is easy to do, since you are looking right
at the cams with the valve cover off, and you can rotate the engine
until the cam lobe points straight away from the valve.  In a pushrod
engine, where the cam is invisible, some other method must be
employed to ensure that you are on the back of the lobe.   The
infallible method (as well as the most tedious) is to rotate the
engine until the valve that you wish to adjust is at the point of
maximum opening.   Then mark the flywheel (or fan, maybe in the case
of the 914) and rotate the engine exactly one revolution.   At this
point, you will be exactly on the back of the lobe, and the
adjustment can be made.

  Needless to say, this is extremely time consuming, and except in
the case of the most radical grind cams, is not necessary.   The
procedures for valve adjustment for an MGB, an Isuzu, and a Nissan
all call for adjusting certain valves with certain other valves
rocking.   This can be done because the manufacturer knows how far
around the cam the circular part extends, and thus how far off from
the exact back of the lobe adjustment is permissable.  Also, it is
true that it is possible to come very close to the exact back of the
lobe for some valves with some other valves rocking, simply owing to
the nature of the valve timing for a particular engine.

  In the case of the flat-four, we have a unique valve layout that
readily allows us to find the point opposite to the peak of the lobe.
  This is because the same cam lobe operates a valve first on one
side of the engine, and then on the other.  For example, when the
exhaust valve on cylinder # 2 is open, the exhaust valve on cylinder
# 4 is as closed as it's going to get, because the tappets for both
valves are riding on the SAME cam lobe, 180 degrees apart.  Hence,
whenever the exhaust valve on # 2 is open, the tappet for the exhaust
valve for # 4 is on the back of the cam lobe, where the adjustment
should be made.  To save time and effort, it will be noted that when
the engine is rotated, there are four places in the rotation where
two valves are open at once.  It is at these four places that the
same type of valve (i.e. intake or exhaust) on the OPPOSITE cylinder
can be adjusted.   The procedure that I have written up will enable
this to be done with a minimum of effort.

   This is the most likely cause.

  Shouldn't be.

   Please note that although the relatively mild cam grind of the 914
makes this perfectly valid, you will not be as close to the back of
the lobe as you would be with my procedure; if you were running a
racing engine with an exotic cam, you might not be able to get
correct clearances this way.
   In addition, finding TDC for all four cylinders requires special
marking of the flywheel as you have described; IMHO just observing
the valves is easier.


*** One other thing can cause eratic valve clearances, and that is
what I am suffering from in my engine.   I have a mushroomed tappet,
that is very rough and irregular on the bottom.   Since the tappet
rotates in it's bore in the engine case as the engine runs (normal,
all tappets should do this) it follows that the irregularities will
be juxtaposed with the cam surface in different ways at different
times.  The result is that the valve clearance can change by values
in excess of .020"!!   This condition makes the particular valve
involved  (in my case, # 4 intake) practically impossible to adjust. 
It is to be assumed that the cam itself is also probably damaged,
calling into question the adjustment of # 2 intake.   As a result, I
typically run aproximately .025" of inlet valve clearance on # 4,
which means that most of the time it clicks like crazy, but some of
the time it is right on.

  However, I should like to point out that this or other departures
from design norms in the engine in no way invalidates the valve
adjustment procedure.
