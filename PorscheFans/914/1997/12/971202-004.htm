Does anyone have one of the tools for installing the crankshaft\case oil
seal on the flywheel side?  Looks like a round plate with 2 bolt holes and
a threaded stud sticking up. You bolt this to the end of the crankshaft,
then there is another larger piece that goes over this, has a center hole
the threaded stud goes through.  You put a nut on the stud and as it is
tightened down the larger piece will go over the crankshaft end and press
the oil seal in evenly and undamaged.

My uncle has machine tools and made me one of these for the T1 seal but the
T4 is different.   I could get the dimensions I need from the T4 engine
crank itself but he has time and can do it now and I won't have the chance
to pull things and measure for a couple months.

If someone has the tool and can give me the measurements I'd appreciate it.
Email directly.  I'm in digest mode.

Thanks,
Jeff
