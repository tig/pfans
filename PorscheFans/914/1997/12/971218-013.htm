J.J.-

I'm a 914 newbie, so take this FWIW...

I don't recall if your car is running the stock FI (has not been carbed),
and you may have already read it, but on the 914 Fans Web Page there are a
series of Technical docs, one of which specifically covers troubleshooting
D-jet problems ("D-Jetronic Fuel Injection for the Porsche 914 (Care and
Feeding for the Owner-Mechanic)" by Kjell Nelin,
http://209.140.128.15/porsche/djet.html).

At one point Kjell states:

   'If the idle "hunts" when turned up all the way it is too lean. Do the
   following, get a 2,000 ohm variable resistor ("pot") and install it in
   series with the Temp Sensor II (in the head). Set the ECU idle
   adjustment at the middle of its range. Starting at zero ohms adjust the
   pot with the engine running (again, at full operating temp) until the
   idle smoothes out or the CO reads about 1.5 - 2.0 %. Shut off the
   engine, remove the pot and measure the resistance. Get a fixed resistor
   near this value and install permanently.'

Could this be a possible solution?  Just a thought...
