To pay someone else to do it, it may be reasonable. I don't know how you are
going to get any more power out of it without changing the fuel injection.
So the price probably includes a completely different fuel injection system
also. The D jet system on your motor is set up specifically for your 1.7
litre displacment and compression ratio and valve timing, etc. If you change
that stuff, then the injection will be too lean or too rich or just not
right. I think a better way to go, assuming you want to contain costs, is to
expect to do most of the work yourself, and to do a top quality stock
rebuild. Depending on the funding situation, if you keep the CR and
displacement stock, you can use your stock FI. There are many things that
can be done that will make your motor better that will not affect the
injection. For example, you could get a counterwieghted crankshaft, lighter
rods, and get the case and heads blue printed. Stuttgart Automotive in Ohio
has a web site that emphatically states that all cases are warped where the
jugs seat. They put each case half on a milling machine and make sure
(within 0.0001") that the seating surface for the jugs is perfectly parallel
to the crank axis. They do heads also. I would get the Raceware nuts and
bolts in addition to inspecting everything very closely. So, depending on
how much you are willing to do yourself, you can make more horsepower and
increase longevity by increasing the mechanical effiency instead of messing
with the volumetric efficiency. You could copper plate the fins on the cast
iron jugs for better heat transfer. You could ceramic coat the combustion
chamber, exhaust ports and valve faces to keep the heads cool. Hoep this helps.

That's a good idea, but they will have to rebuilt also.

These are usually about 10K.

2K for a paint job is cheap. My advice, for what it's worth, is to do a
little at time, that way you are not overwhelmed by the cost. Consider it an
on-going occupation, rather than a one shot deal. Look, you either pay the
interest and loose depreciation on a new car or you fix up an old car. All
cars require repair after they are paid for (some before then). It's not
like a house, where you can usually just fix it and it stays fix for
decades. Car parts wear out, car bodies rust out, it's the nature of the
beast. I would just rather have a car that I like and that I can fix myself.
I would also rather have a car that is fully depreciated (and hopefully
A-preciating), that I can add value to. The alternative is to have the
pleasure of watching yourself loose money just having the car sitting in the
driveway. Which would you prefer??
