Hi Folks, Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!
Well, here it goes... I bought my first 914 (74 2.0)=20
in San Jose, CA 1986.  It had been rolled, if you=20
can believe that! $400 and I DROVE it home.  I wired
a piece of thick Plexiglas to the mangled windshield
frame to keep the bugs out of my teeth.  I spent ~$500=20
rebuilding the upper body, replaced some lids and sold=20
it when I moved to L.A. in 89 for college.  I bought a 75=20
1.8 in 1990 and couldn't really do any thing with it (no $$$$).
Sold it about 4 mo. later.  I gained sort of an education
regarding these cars and thought I'd hold off on buying another
 'til I landed a job after graduating.  Well, I work at the =20
L.A. Police Department's Crime Lab...you know...
the O.J. Simpson conspirators=20
(JOKE! just a joke).  Been working there for 3 yrs and love it!=20
I just got married in Aug, awesome.
She is a chiropractor and has a genuine heart of gold.  Talk about=20
being understanding, I have 2 trunk lids, 1 engine lid, 1 ctr console,
and all my tools in the living room!!  Our microwave stand is my=20
Craftsman roll-away.  I don't know who said it first, but I too, need
a three car garage with an attatched house. =20
So, now that the $$$ is just rollin' in by the truckloads, I bought a
75 2.0 in Oct 96.  It's being kept at my brother-in-law's because
we only have an open carport right now.  It's difficult to work on it=20
there... lack of space and a 200 lbs Great Dane living in the back=20
yard!!  But I've managed to (with the generous help of the people=20
on the list) completely rebuild/upgrade the front suspension.  Koni
Sports, turbo tie rod kit, new balljoints, new bushings (I have to=20
correctly reinstall), Weltmeister front bar and 5 bolt hubs.  Found=20
some rust and I'm working on it.  The 2.0 was out of the car and=20
partially disassembled but I'll try and get it together.  I'm planning
on a V8 conversion (probably stems from my '67 Chevelle days in=20
high school) complete w/ wide bodywork like the 1976-7 Cook/=20
Altec-Lansing 914/6 racer (saw it at Laguna Seca when I was a kid,
I was hooked!).  I know that some purists may frown, but It's just
something I gotta do.  I'm looking for a '73 2.0 to poss. autoX.  I'll
keep it stock ...for awile.  Ramble, ramble ramble!!  Just wanna say=20
that I've learned a little bit about a lot of 914 topics and I hope that =
I
can, in the new year, contribute a little more as I continue my 914
education.  Good luck to all in the New Year!

Mike Mastrocovo....has left the building.
