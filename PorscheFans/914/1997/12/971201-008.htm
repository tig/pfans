Got a question for you all.  About a month ago, I wussed out and had a
local shop replace my rear wheel bearings.  Cost an arm and a leg, but
their charge seemed to be pretty much in keeping with others'
experience.

My question is, would the shop have had to remove the outer CV joint
bolts in order to replace the wheel bearings?

The reason I ask is that one of my outer CVs fell off today (Cory,
remember what I told you I thought was making that noise?).  All 4 bolts
are there and appear to be in fine condition - not sheered off or
damaged-looking in any way, but the CV joint is probably damaged because
3 of the balls were out and laying inside the trailing arm and the car
rolled about 100 feet before it was brought it to a stop.

I just need to know if the shop failed to tighten them or if they just
worked loose on their own.

Thanks in advance.
