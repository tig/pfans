Ahhh!  So the proper wording would have been, "I think I'M missing an
important point here".  Sorry if I insulted your intelligence anywhere
along the line.  I've had chokes on the brain (take that one however you
want) lately trying to deal with the p.o.s. Solex carb on my old VW
pickup.

So you really ARE looking for a device that will raise your idle while
you warm up (yes, I'm a little dense sometimes).  The coldest weather I
typically see is only down into the mid 20s (S. Texas is great that way)
so I guess colder climates might require more help in this area.

>I don't think I need to explain once again why I prefer carbs, do I?

I'm entirely with you on the complexity/reliability factor here.  I've
run dual Webers (and still do) on my 73 VW bus for nearly 7 years and
ran them on the 914 for 3 years (90,000 miles combined) with 0
breakdowns due to carburetion and 0 dollars for carb repairs (other than
experimenting with different jets/venturis and an occasional gasket).  I
have yet to accumulate enough miles with my recently installed FI to
make any statements about reliability, but the complexity is
substantially higher.

The only problem I ever had/have with the carbs is leaks between the
manifolds and heads.  I have to remove/reseat at least one of the ones
on the bus about once a year and I never did seem to get the ones on the
914 completely sealed for any length of time.  I typically check the
balance on them twice a year and very rarely have to adjust them (I
STRONGLY recommend the Weber brand 'X'-bar linkage for the setup).

Good luck on your cable-quest.
