Hi fans,

Although not a 914 person (912E), I need some help on a problem any 914 
2.0 owner may have faced.  It's an oil leak!!

Someone e-mailed me to ask, "What do you call a Porsche that doesn't 
leak oil?"  Answer:  "A Porsche with no oil in it!"...but I really don't 
want to live with a pan under the car if I can help it!!

The pushrod tube seals seem to be the weakpoint in this case and a 
goodly three to four tablespoons of oil leak out per 48 hours standing.  
The oil drips onto the thermal reactor boxes and if not wiped prior to 
startup creates a pretty decent stink.

The big Q's are:

Must I drop the motor to replace tubes and seals (8 tubes and 16 seals , 
right?)  Tubes and seals cheap-  dropping motor NOT CHEAP!!

Is there a short cut?

Is this a symptom of switching to synthetic oil?

Overfilling the motor with oil- which I do (a bit) to compensate for low 
oil pressure light flickering?

Motor rebuilt about two years ago- 72 K miles original, checks out OK at 
Porsche garage except for leak!!

I've received some advice on this, as in 'don't sweat it' etc.  but 
would like to get this thing sealed up.  I drive the car at relatively 
high sustained speeds and long distances here in Italy, and it runs very 
well, if a little on the 'warm' side.  85-95 mph for 4 hours would not 
be unusual (given normal 100mph+ traffic on the Autostrada).

Lastly, your wisdom on HD oil pumps, oil pressure relief pistons, large 
sumps, etc.  All aftermarket to help out the hot running 2.0 motor.  
Your suggestions, comments, and advice are really welcome!!

Have a super Holiday season, and thanks!

Happy to discuss European driving conditions, realities, etc.  Been all 
over, including former Eastern Bloc states.
