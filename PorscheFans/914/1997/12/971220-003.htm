First off, I'm in the market to to pick up a side shifter tranny, if
anyone has an extra that they would like to sell.  I'm also looking to
get the shift linkage from the tranny to the firewall.  I have a '71
that I'm would like to drop a side shift into, and my my local
consultant (that's you John!) says that mine has already got the linkage
from the knob to the firewall.  I have a tailshifter for parts, so
condition is negotiable.

Next:  I've got the rear floorpan most of the way out and while I'm at
it (eeek!) is there anything I should go after with regards to R&R while
it's out?  Replacing things in the tunnel come to mind, between the
firewalls, etc.  I am of course, resisting the urge to go after the
front, since I've already got the rear out and the welder will be warmed
up.  I also noticed the inner firewall is a little rusted in spots, and
the seat belt mount looks a little shagged, etc,etc...

Maybe I should stick to snap-together models! Probably cheaper!

Thanks in advance!
