	The Club Race last weekend at Thunder Hill Raceway in
Northern California was quite an event.  Kudos go to our own
Mike Willis (AKA "Chili") and all who helped to put it on.
	The new track configuration at TH looks to be a whole
lot of fun to drive.  It has 15 "official" turns, and covers
more than three miles.  It may be a lot to remember, but it's
got to be a great drive!  (Some in-car video I've seen confirms
this.)  Best of all, there is *tons* of run-off room in most
places, so if you go off-course all you hit is mud.  Although
the Thunder Hill mud seems to be a cross between quicksand and
Velcro...
	The weekend was rather cleanly driven, for the most
part.  There was only one major incident, when a 911 spun at
the beginning of the main straight, and went nose-then-tail
into the pit wall.  A couple minor incidents involved people
finding out that the mud wasn't necessarily as soft as it looked.

	Sights of interest to 914-oriented folks:  A factory
962.  (That should be of interest to everyone.)  The owner had
only driven the car at one or two prior events, so he was trying
to figure out where the limits were.  During the late-Saturday
practice session (with light rain), he gave several drivers the
thrill of a lifetime--being able to pass a 962 on the racetrack.
(With 700+ HP, *I* certainly would be hesitant to put the pedal
all the way down in a car I didn't know that well...)
	I noticed a 911 GT-1 on track as well.  A bit later, I
got a look under the body panels (*LOTS* of mud was being washed
out of the car) and discovered something very interesting.  The
suspension was a 993 suspension--rear aluminum sub-frame and all.
Most of the car's frame was made of welded tubes, but the engine
looked very familiar.  It was an MFI 911 motor (I later found
that it was a 2.8 RSR-type motor).  Then I had a look at the
middle of the car.  The floor pan was *very* familiar.  It was a
914!  Converted to a center-mounted seat, with lots of custom
controls and gauges--very slick.  This car was actually a 914-6
with a custom one-off 911 GT-1 body kit!  Wow!  It looked very
fast sitting still, and it *was* very fast on the race track.
	I asked the owner how much a body kit for a street car
would cost.  He answered, "We'll see..."
	I noticed one four-banger 914 as well.  In one race, we
got to see this car pass a 3.6-liter 911 RS-America, and put some
distance on it!  Warmed the cockles of my heart, let me tell you.
One of the ultimate no-respect Porsches of all time--the 1.8 liter
four-cylinder 914--getting around an early-90's "lightweight" 911
with (probably) a hundred more horsepower.
	Of course, this was a fully-prepared SCCA E-Production
race car.  No  windshield, big flares, slicks, sewer pipe though
the cockpit, the whole nine yards.  The motor puts out something
in the range of 140-160 horsepower.  (Yes, out of a 1.8!!!)  The
car weighs in at about 1800#.  The "sewer pipe" mentioned above is
a duct to get air from the headlight buckets to the fan.  The car
has the stock 914 brakes--they *can* be made to work well!  Of
course, you can't actually see the brakes for all the cooling-air
ductwork around them...  Quite a neat car, and *boy* does it move!

	It was a bit cold up in Willows, particularly on Saturday,
but it was still a lot of fun.  I hope that everyone who came out
to drive enjoyed themselves.
	BTW, I'll also be up at the second local Club Race this
weekend at Sears Point.  I'll be doing Tech and/or Safety on
Friday and Saturday, and playing shutterbug on Sunday.  If you get
up there, stop by and say "hi"!
