You don't want the CIS injection. That was for the later cars. You want the
mechanical injection from the early 70's. In those days, mechanical
injection was used for more power than carbs could deliver. Once set up
properly, the mechanical injection is extremely low maintainence. The pump
is expensive to rebuild, but that only happens once in 100,000 miles. Carbs
have sex appeal and have the vintage look, but I would install the
mechanical injection if it was at least comperable in price to carbs. I'm
not a 911 guy, so I don't know too much (but that doesn't seem to stop me
from commenting!).
