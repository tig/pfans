What!, was this car preserved in some kind of zero humidity, hemetrically
sealed time capsule for the last 25 years???

Your car is better than mine was when I bought it. I had about 4 mouse
nests, so there! I know all about mouse nests and moues turds....

The wax is a must do. It creeps into the the pinch welds and stops water and
air from getting to the rust. Check with a local autobody supplier for the
correct product. You can get the rubber plugs there also.

Also, 3M usually makes the best products, but they are pricey. Thier
abrasives are really outstanding.

Do not sand blast the car. The sand gets wedged into pinch welds and will
not ever come out. Then as the body flexes, the sand abrades the metal,
removing any coatings and allowing rust to start. I wouldn't even use that
plastic media.
