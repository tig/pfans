Hi, J.J.!

(cc to Porschefans-914)

   I am super behind in my E-mail, and haven't been able to keep up
with the list.   I was on the verge of writing you a couple of times,
but each time that I got around it, you had already solved that
problem, and gone on to something else.

     I am not sure, but I assume that you got your ignition system
working OK; if not, that's a good place to start.

  If so, then you might try disconnecting your throttle position
switch and see if the engine still hunts around as badly.

  Lastly, this is the advice that I got from Chris Kolstadt; although
I have not tried it, I intend to, because my car still has lean hunt
at idle, and the pot on the brain has no effect; also my idle speed
screw has limited effect, indicating a way-too-lean mixture.   Since
I have already tried a fixed resistor in series withthe Temp Sensor
II with some effect, but still indications of too lean, I am back to
suspecting my manifold pressure sensor.   Here is Chris's advice:

"    I got mine to pass with flying colors.  But there is a
process.  It is "easy" to get a tuned car to pass on the idle
pollutants by just
adjusting your idle adjustment screw on the "brain".  As for the high
rpm
test, that's a little more difficult.  You have to pull out the
pressure
sensor and remove the cover on the end.  It is put in with epoxy, so
you will either have to take a flame thrower to it or use a Dremel
tool
like I did (are't Dremels great?).  The screw that you expose is the
adjustment screw for your over-all mixture.  Pay the guy at the smog
check $10
and tell him you want to adjust your mixture.  Turn your idle mixture
all the
way rich (clockwise I believe which seems backwards) on the brain. 
Then
run the car at the 3000 rpm (or whatever the high rpm limit is) and
adjust
your newly exposed adjustment screw.  It is a little touchy, so be
patient. After your high rpm emissions are passing (try to make them
pass
easily so you don't have trouble when you do the real test), go back
to idle
and adjust the screw on the brain.  Then, just for grins, recheck
your
high rpm limit one more time.
        After doing all this, you should be ready to pass smog. 
We'll keep our fingers crossed for you.

   It is my opinion that the "generic" factory adjustment on the MPS
units needs to be fine-tuned to suit each individual car.   I know
you have a new MPS, and may be reluctant to do what is necessary to
get that plug out of the end, but that may be the only solution.   I
will post this to the net as well so that you can get other comments.
  If the advice is strongly against it, maybe you had better not try
it, but short of finding a mechanic who has 1x10^6 hours of
experience with D-jet, I don't see any other way.
