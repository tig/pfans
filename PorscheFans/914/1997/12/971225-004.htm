Hi Thom!

  I can help with one item, anyway... valves.   You wrote:

  Your backfire may have nothing to do with valves; J.J.'s suggestion
is a good one.  You might also want to do a compression check, and
maybe even a leak-down test.   Having said that,  I think I need to
re-post my valve adjustment procedure.   I am firmly convinced that
it is the easiest and most accurate way to adjust the 914's valves.  
I am not convinced that observing the distributor rotor position is
very accurate, and it surely is a pain to crawl out from under the
car three or four times to observe the thing, when it isn't
necessary.

   Here's the easy way (and a more accurate one, as far as engine
rotational position is concerned).   First the theory behind it, and
then the procedure follows:

   I should like to point out that the 914-4 engine is a derivitive 
of the good old VW engine designed by Dr. Porsche way 
back when.  As the "people's car"  everything, including the
engine, was designed for cheap mass production.  As part 
of this philosophy, Dr. Porsche reasoned (I take license here) 
something like this:  "Why should I design a typical 4-cylinder
engine camshaft with 8 lobes, when I can get by with half 
that number?"  Due to the flat-four layout, each cam
lobe does double duty, actuating a valve first on one side of
the engine, and then on the other.  

  This then gives rise to a simplified adjustment procedure, 
which I have printed up and glued into my Haynes manual
to replace the rather cumbersome procedure in the book.

It works perfectly.  I quote verbatim:

1.  Jack up car and place on stands;  block one rear road
wheel to prevent it's turning, engage 5th gear, handbrake off.

2.  Valve clearances are adjusted with the engine COLD.
Clearances are INTAKE = .006"  EXHAUST = 008".  ('74 
model year, 2.0 litre engine)  Remove valve covers, clean
up spilled oil, and check gaskets; renew if necessary.

3. Using the unblocked roadwheel as a handwheel,
rotate the engine until the rockers are rocking in accordance
with the first entry in the table below.  Adjust the clearances 
of the corresponding valves as shown in the table.  Continue
rotating engine and adjusting valves until all have been 
done.  Re-install valve covers.

4.  Valve adjustment table:  # denotes cylinder number;
 Ex = Exhaust valve;  In = Intake valve.

Turn until Rocking:                     Adjust:

#2 Ex & #3 In                           #4 Ex & #1 In
#1 Ex & #2 In                           #3 Ex & #4 In
#4 Ex & #1 In                           #2 Ex & #3 In
#3 Ex & #4 In                           #1 Ex & #2 In

  It follows logically that a valve opposite one that is open is 
on the back of the same cam lobe, the perfect place for 
adjustment.  It is only necessary to be certain of which 
valves actually share the same cam lobe, which can be a 
little tricky owing to the offset nature of the cylinder layout. 
However, I believe that I have done this, and that 
further, I have worked it out so that, if the valves are 
adjusted in the order given in the table, a minimum amount
of engine rotation will be necessary to complete the task.

   One other helpful hint:   Unless you are VERY familiar with
the engine layout, clean two spots on the bottom of each head
next to the pair of valves associated with each cylinder
and mark the cylinder number in the cleaned spots with 
magic marker so that it can be seen from under the car.
This will help you figure out which cylinder is which while
you are upside down under the car, and is an invaluable aid
in using the table.  The cylinder layout can be taken
from fig. 3.3 on page 63 of the Haynes book, or, if the
engine is clean enough, can be taken from stamped
numbers in the engine sheetmetal.


					Good Luck,
                                                            Jim T.
