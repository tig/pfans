Hi Folks;

OK, so the engine/transmission is now lying on the floor outside the
car. About 2 hours and a floor jack with a 21" reach - boy, they are
easier then pulling my 911's engines. Hey, I even remembered to
disconnect the ground strap at the transmission (next time I'll remember
the throttle cable, too...)

OK, so I found a *little* rust on the piece that runs from the engine
shroud to the inner wheelhouse firewall (yes, of course it's the right
side..). Two small holes on either side of the longitudinal near the
front fire wall. Just for good measure, I'm also going to replace the
battery tray support as well - the battery tray is like "new". But here
are my questions:

Welding recommendation with a MIG - any thoughts as to whether to butt,
seam or spot weld (drill a hole in the new piece and "tack" it to the
old metal)? What gauge sheet metal do I use - 22 gauge? Is this a
stressed part or not (doesn't appear to be..).

The longitudinals, inner rockers, etc. are great.  Any comments about
how to keep these in good condition. I've seen a couple of posts that
recommend that a small hole be drilled on the undersides and get in
there with some rust inhibitor? Like what? Is this a good idea?

Seeing as I'm going to do a total respray of the car - how do I get the
rear window out (preferably without breaking it..)?

Should I relocate the battery? If yes, to where (front or rear trunk -
where?) The car will be used primarily in AutoX, so I want to maintain
some balance (after I dump the '75 bumpers for a set of '73's).

Thanks in advance for any input..

John Dunkle
