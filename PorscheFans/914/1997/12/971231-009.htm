It's not really a safety thing. The stock tie rods have a soft rubber
bushing, which allows a fair amount of play in the steering. And the
turbo tie rods are ball in socket type joints and have very little slop
in them at all. The basic reason to do the upgrade is to get really
crisp steering response. Personally, I don't see a need for them as I've
been totally happy with the way my 914 responds.

When you've got a feeler under the rocker pad and it just slides around,
you should have a little bit of friction there, if it doesn't slide
easilly than it's too tight. If there's no friction, than it's too
loose.
