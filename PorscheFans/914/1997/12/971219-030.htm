Hey Chris, long time eh? I wouldn't risk the stock valve. Once it's
tweaked, it may spring a leak that is terminal. There are a number of
replacement adjustable valves. There is the wilwood, which is a knob,
and there's another lever type one with seven click in settings. But why
put it out of the passenger compartment? Is this a Zone7 thing? There
are no such restrictions in Street Prepared.
