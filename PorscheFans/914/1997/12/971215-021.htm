	That was the Neidel-mobile.  Ugly thing, with those tacked-on
looking flares, the paint that apparently was sun-faded coming out of
the spray nozzle, the chopped-off spoiler on the rear decklid with the
oil cooler in the middle...  And REALLY REALLY REALLY fast.  At least,
it is with a Neidel behind the wheel.  It doesn't seem to matter which
one, either.
	Then again, put any one of them behind the wheel of *my* car,
and I'll probably be looking at the bad end of a 1.5 second gap.   8^(
	If you've still got the GGR directory, Josh, give them a call.
They're very helpful and friendly (as anyone who has met them knows).
It's not for nothing that they've been national PCA Family of the Year
on at least one occasion.
	(Or get Mikey to ask.)
