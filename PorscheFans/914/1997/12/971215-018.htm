I sent this out last week, but didn't see it show up on the lists, so
I'm resending it. Pardon me please if this is a repeat.

Question to all of you with GT Flares:

        I am now planning on GT flares for my CSP autoxer, but the
comment
about only 7" wheels fitting up front bothers me. I would very much like
to run equal size wheels and tires front and rear, and would really like
to know if anyone can say anything about running 8 or 9s (preferably 9s)
up in front. I don't care if it rubs at full lock, the only time I
expect to be at full lock is in the paddock or recovering from a serious
spin, either way it's not gonna make much of a difference then. So if
any one has any experience with this, please let me know. I can (and
will if needed) run spacers to help it out.

        Secondly, regarding oil cooler locations. I remember seeing a
rear
spoiler mounted oil cooler on a 914 once. Was that you Ferguson? And
would like to hear any pros and cons about that mounting location. This
is for an engine oil cooler, not tranny. I know, I know, mount it in
front. But the rules in my class prohibit me from cutting sheet metal,
and I don't feel comfortable hanging it out in front of the bumper for
road debris (or high speed cones) to whack it around.

Thanks all.
