I have a 75 2.0 that I autocross and time-trial extensively in the
summer heat of Texas (easily 100 plus).  I have an aluminum auxiliary
oil cooler mounted in the engine area, on the driver's side of the
transmission, beginning just aft of the half shaft.  It is canted at
about a 30 degree angle front to back (with the inlet of the cooler
forward and upright).  The cooler is mounted in a cooler bracket
attached to the trunk floor (just behind the horizontal beam in the
trunk) and stabilized at the bottom with a brace attached to the back
panel of the engine compartment.  I also installed a NACA duct in the
driver's side rocker panel and routed silicon hose from there, over the
half shaft,  to another duct in front of the cooler, and then installed
an electric fan aft of the cooler.  I also have a Mocal oil thermostat.
The duct in front of the cooler helps deflect any oil/grease from
clogging the cooler.

I have had great results with this set-up (about 6 years of experience
with it), never experiencing oil temperatures above 185-190 degrees.

The only problem this setup entails is if you run with a rear stabilizer
bar, the cooler location would interfere - it would sit in the way of
the mounting points for the bar to the body.  We've found a rear bar
actually produces slower times, anyway.
