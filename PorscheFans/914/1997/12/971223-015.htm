There's a special socket you can get from Snap On, but RD Rick uses a deep
impact socket for the stretch bolt. You need a small puller to get first
gear drive gear off (the tiny gear). The castle nut is about 70 lb ft,
don't recall what the stretch bolt is.

The number one thing to look for is cracks in that tiny first speed drive
gear. You have to take it off, clean it real good, and either examine it
real close under strong light, or use a crack test kit from your local
welding supply shop. There are very few of these gears that do not have
cracks and/or do not show a spall line near the root of each tooth, mostly
on one side of each tooth. Here's a tip: Use the first speed from the tail
shifter. The reason is that these gearboxes were connected to little 1.7
litre motors, which have much less torque than the later larger motors. I
have 2 side shifter trannys, and both of them had good first speed gears.
You must replace the gears in pairs, so don't get them confused when you
start disassembly. The reason is that they are "run in" together as pairs
during manufacturing. Oh yeah, new first speed gears are going for about a
thousand dollars! I've heard that they will soon be NLA.

Check your tail shifter for a limited slip diff. You might get lucky.

Buy new synchros. They are cheap (less than 20$ each). You don't need that
special tool to remove and replace the synchros. You need a pair of medium
size snap ring pliers and a screwdriver. To remove one, you expand the
large snap ring-like cover with the pliers and use the screwdriver as a pry
bar to force it out of the groove. The synchro will pop out easily after
that. To install a new ring, put the gear on a flat surface, put the
synchro on the gear and slide on the shift collar to compress the synchro
and hold it in place. Then put the brakes in the correct orientation and
take the large snap ring and expand it. It will buckle, so you have to
wrestle with it a little, but while it's expanded you can get it in one of
the grooves and slip it around. It's takes some gusto, but it works. Wear
gloves or you will be cut by the sharp teeth.

You can't swap parts willy-nilly between transmissions for several reasons.
As much as I wanted to complete my transmission myself, I'm going to have
to send it out to have the ring and pinion set up. Most likely, all of your
bearings are shot or nearly shot, and it doesn't make sense to rebuild a
transmission and not replace the bearings. The bearings are insanely
expensive. Some of them are over 100$ each! The catch is that there are
only 2 bearings you can replace without having to reset the ring and
pinion. These would be the 2 on the input shaft. All of the others (the 2
on the pinion shaft and the 2 on the differential) effect the R&P
clearance. There are shims on the differential and between the pinion gear
and its bearing. The special Porsche tools used for this are not available,
and the VW tools are extremely expensive. JCM transmissions charges about
180$ to set up a R&P.

Also, you can't swap intermediate plates without effecting the R&P, because
they are all somewhat different either in thickness or in bearing mount
location. Obviously, a different plate also requires a different set of
gaskets. Check your intermediate plate for cracks and for worn shift rail
holes. Mine were worn, especially the one for 1st and rev. The usual
solution is to replace the plate and reset the R&P. I bought some bronze
bushings and I'm going to have them installed instead. Some things have
happened this year, so I've been delayed in getting this part done.

Obviously, all bearing surfaces on the shafts and gears must be checked.
The needle bearings are cheap, so replace them. Also, there's a spec for
the runout of the input shaft, which is measured at the pilot bearing
location.
