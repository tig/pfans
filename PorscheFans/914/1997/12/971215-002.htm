914 Fans: 
 I want to thank all of those who sent me information about 
the problem with my 914. It  run, a lot of power then the engine 
would quit without any warning. I checked the coil and it was within 
specs. I pulled the two black wires off the coil and one of the wires 
was loose inside the connector. I replaced the connectors on both 
wires and it corrected the problem. Now I have another one. The car 
will start and run with no problems in the garage. I can turn the key 
off and restart the engine any number of times.The engine runs at an 
even 950 rpms. I can increase the rpms to 2500 or 3000 rpm. When I  
take my foot off the gas petal, the engine drops down to 950 rpms.  
If I take the car out on the street, stop and turn engine off and try 
to restart it, the engine floods. I can disconnect the ground wire on 
the fuel pump and attempt to start the car. Most of the time it will 
start and it will run.When the engine burns all of the excess gas in 
the system. I reconnect the the ground wire on the fuel pump and 
restart the car. Then the car runs great until I turn off the engine 
then the engine will flood again when I attempt to start the car. 
This only happens when the car is driven.. I have connected a fuel 
pressure gauge and the pressure is an even 29 psi. I am going to 
leave the pressure gauge connected for a while. I have disconnected 
the cold start valve. . I'm going to clean the fuel injectors again, 
check out their flow and see if they leak under pressure. I will also 
pull the wiring harness and check it out again.  On the plus side,  
The engine does not pump gas out of the tail pipe any more, and the 
engine doesn't quit, without any warning , when I am running it.  
Again I seek help in finding a solution.
Thanks
Jim Branch
