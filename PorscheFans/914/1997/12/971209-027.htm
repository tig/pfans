I've used the Endure...it worked fine, and took primer nicely.  It was
about two days between applying the coating and primering.  I used an
epoxy primer.

Good idea to do some clean-up ahead applying the coating, although you
don't have to be too fussy; the coating makes a hard surface of what was
rust.  Try to get it a smooth as possible before coating, and of course
remove any rust that flakes off ahead of time.

Think POR-15 is essentially the same.
