Dave,

I just remembered some thing about another possible cause although it is
very remote.  Check your vacuum diaphragm on your dizzy.  In the old carb
days if the diaphragm failed (leaked) it would allow gas fumes past and
they would enter the dizzy.  And Blam, Pow, WACK, fumes ignite and burn
your points.  Very remote in an EFI car, but still possible.

Also I tried to do some checking on the blue coil, Boch also makes a red
coil.  My stock coil has a resistance of 9.35 Ohms on the primary, the
Blue coil has a resistance of 10.43 Ohms.  I think I will go down to
Bubba's bug world and see what Compufire sells and if it has a ballast
resistor built in or not.  40,000Vs looks good, but direct fire is
tempting 60,000V is defiantly better. BTW, the Compufires Coils have a
street price of less than $50.

Take care,
