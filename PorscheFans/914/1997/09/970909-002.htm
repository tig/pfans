I wouldn't recommend sand blasting.  It will get sand EVERYWHERE!!!  You can
do fine with a sharp wood chisel and a wire brush on a 4" grinder.  You need
to make a brace that will bolt between the door hinge bracket and the striker
plate bracket, this will help keep the car from sagging in the middle.  You
can always temporarily weld a brace between the roll bar and windshield frame
as well, or door posts too.

If your torsion bushings are a little worn, torsion bar will have some
deflection.  A little isn't too much to worry about on a street car, if your
doing any competition driving I'd replace the bushings with something less
compliant.
