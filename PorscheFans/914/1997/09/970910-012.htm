You have pretty much said it yourself. MPS. If you're worried about
cost, get a rebuilt MPS. It really does sound like the MPS has been
screwed with one time too often. I just want to say this right now, and
this is not personal, the MPS was never intended to be a regularly
adjusted item! That's why the factory sealed the adjuter screw. Just
because something _can_ be tweaked doesn't mean that it should be. The
ECU knob and the MPS screw DO NOT serve the same purpose. The ECU knob
only effects the idle mixture, so twisting the MPS to set idle will only
end up damaging the MPS. And cranking on the ECU to set WOT mixture does
nothing. My guess is that the MPS is simply screwed up and has probably
been so mucked with that it may not be recoverable. If you're concerned
about the injectors, then diconnect the coil, pull out a bank of
injectors at a time and test them. Have them spray into a small bottle.
Has your fuel pressure been checked? If not, get that checked as well,
you may simply be running rich due to excessive fuel pressure. Injectors
are expensive and will probably not fail in amanner consistent with your
symptoms. And ECUs are pretty much bomb-proof, so don't suspect the
brain yet.

If you've got that much money to burn, sure. I'd play it a little safer
and make sure that you really do need to replace those components. 

Measure fuel pressure, if it's good (28-32 PSI) then test the MPS.

You can test the coils of the MPS by measuring resistance at the
terminals. Terminals 7 to 15 should be 90 ohms, and 8 to 10 shoudl be
350 ohms. If these check out see if the MPS holds vacuum, the diapraghm
may be damaged and will not work no matter how much you turn that screw.
If that lookes good , see if you can borrow a working MPS to test with,
just hook it up and see if the problem repeats itself, if the problem
goes away, then the MPS was bad.

If the fuel pressure checks out, the injector spray patterns look good,
and the MPS is determined to be good, THEN you can consider replacing
the brain. Don't throw away money needlessly. But if you really do feel
so inclined, send some of that money my way. ;) Baby needs a new set of
tires...
