A couple of questions...

My Tachometer has never worked.  I have a 914 that has been converted to
a carburetor (Holley 5200).  Somebody told me that I could hook it up to
the negative side of the ignition coil.  Has any body tried that?

I finally installed my cylinder head temp guage.  It's been reading
about 300-350 degrees.  Is that normal?

Thanks

P.S. After a whole summer on my back, oil dripping in my hair, rust
flakes under my contact lenses, I finally managed to get my car to the
track.  At first I struggled, but after a few helpful words from my
instructor ("keep off
the breaks") I started to have a darn good time with this little car.
 Even with my street tires, I was surprised how well it stuck and how
much in
control I felt.  The only drag was getting killed on the straights by
every Tom, Dick and Guido in their Mustangs, Camaros, etc.  What a great
little car!  I'm already looking forward to next year!  Too bad it took
all summer to get the show on the road.
