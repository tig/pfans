yeah, I was wondering about a couple of things.  

1-It seems like it is getting harder to get my (72 tailshifter) into reverse
and first.  Sometimes I am at a stoplight, and it takes me 2 or 3 tries to
get it in there.  Sometimes I leave it in first, just so I wont hold of
traffic when the light changes.  What bushing(s) should I buy to solve this
problem? I dont want to get a whole set, because some you dont need.  I just
want to get the one or two bushings that are prone to failure.  I am sure
they have not been changed in a very long time because the old owners were
cheap.  What do I need?

2-Whenever I turn on the heat, it seems like the interior really starts to
smell. Is this from old hoses or what?  I know the car gets heat from the
engine, so I guess it could be that too.  But has anyone tried to fashion a
makeshift air filter over the fan? Or do the hoses need replacement?  What do
I do to keep that stale burned gas/oil vapor out of my cockpit????????
