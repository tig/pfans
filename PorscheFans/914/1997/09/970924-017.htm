Just a note to report that my 'bucking on acceleration' problem
appears to have been resolved by installation of new ignition
trigger points. On inspection, the old ones were pretty badly pitted.
I did notice some carbon build-up on the distributor cap contacts
which I cleaned when installing the new trigger points - this
could have contributed to the problem, but I suspect the trigger
points were the real cure.

After verifying the fix with the new points, I installed the new MPS,
but it hardly made a difference. Apparently the old MPS, in combination
with the 500 ohm resistor in the CHT lead, was doing the job even
though it would not hold a vacuum. I do suspect it was ready
to poop out anytime though.

PS. Bet you can't guess why the end of the heater hose got shredded
on the way in this morning... what the h#$% was that?
(It was late when I finished last night.)
