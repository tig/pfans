I guess your tire choice will really depend on two things. One, how much
money are you willing to spend. And two, what kind of driving you plan
on doing. I gather that you plan on driving fairly hard and want a tire
with good grip and low price. Your pick of the A509 is ideal. As far as
I, and many others, are concerned the A509 is the best bang-for-the-buck
tire out there. You can certainly pay more, but you won't be getting
quite as much for your money. There certainly are better and stickier
tires out there, they just cost a good deal more.
