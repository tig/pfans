          Would like to put my two cents in here about the 914. I
          bought one when I saw one on the side of the street. I did
          not know a damn thing about the car. I liked its looks (yes
          I am strange) and loved the way it drove (use to have a
          CRX).  Anyway, I bought it and drove it for 3 years in
          college no problems. But college was in PA and being my only
          car ment a lot of winter driving. The rust in the rockers
          went from almost none to a lot. At the cost of about 2,000 I
          had the rockers repair and clam shell reinforcement panels
          welded in. Then I noticed a knocking sound coming from the
          motor. It had 150,000 miles on it at that point. So out came
          the engine. Now I have 5,000 miles with an oil pressure
          light on when hot so who knows were this will lead. It was
          my only car for 5 years and put 60,000 miles on it in that
          time and loved it. I have had to refurbish the car after
          that and it has cost major dollars, but I love the car and
          will do a six conversion. Anyway in summary I got 60,000
          miles with no break downs and just general maintence, but to
          keep the car going afterwards big dollars!!

          Nick
