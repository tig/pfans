The Kumho is a good tire. And it's starting to prove itself a
competetive tire with just slightly longer tread life than the BFG.
However, those winning drivers may just as easilly have won on BFGs as
well. So the jury is still out on the Kumho. The Hoosier autox radial is
a very sticky tire and is much lighter than the BFG, but you will
certainly sacrifice tread life. That, and the Hoosier will generally
require more negative camber than the BFG, and as such may be
inappropriate for some set-ups.

Woah! I don't want to burst your bubble Stephen, but slicks are
explicitly forbidden in Street Prepared. D.O.T. tires only in Street
Prepared and Stock. Probably a good thing too. Slicks require a much
different care and feeding than DOT race tires, and the allowable
suspension mods in Street Prepared are sometimes (depending on the car)
insufficient to accomodate the needs that slicks have. 

But it is true, slicks are night and day compared to even current DOT
race tires. But wait for just a wee sprinkle of the wet stuff and those
grooves on your DOT race tires may well be worth FTD against those on
slicks. They don't call 'em slicks for nothin'. When it's dry, you will
never experience better stick and higher lateral Gs (without ground
effects). But when the ground gets wet, LOOK OUT! Remember how far that
stone you skipped accross the lake went? It's an experience...
