I took the tank out to replace the hoses and to check the outlet and
return.  It was the return that had been plugged up earlier, discovered
when reinstalling the FI.  We ran a wire up into it until it cleared.  I
had planned to pull and check it but hadn't, then when under the car last
weekend I noticed gas around the old hose connected to it.  When I pulled
the tank I noticed that the leak seemed to be around the outlet itself.  I
got sidetracked by the fresh air fan and cleaning up the area under the
tank so haven't checked yet, or looked at the manual to see what is in that
connection.

What can I expect when I take the hose connections off, I may want to stop
and pick up parts on the way home.  Is there some kind of packing there, or
washers?  Maybe a filter screen like the VW's use inside the tank?  I am
about ready to put everything else back so want to get the tank ready now.

Whatever the stock setup is, does anyone have suggestions for a better way.

I was planning on using regular fuel line at the tank (long enough so next
time I can lift the tank to clamp and remove the lines) since the
connections aren't under the FI pressure, am I overlooking something?

Those fiber pads that go between the gas tank and body in 3 places (at
least I have 3) seem designed to absorb water and rust.  I cleaned up the
tank and body in these spots and used POR15 on the areas.  Anyone have a
better item to use other than the fiber pads.  Sheet rubber maybe?  Any
ideas?
