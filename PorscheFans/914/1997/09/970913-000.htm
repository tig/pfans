David:

I do... Eight years ago, before I did the six-cylinder conversion, 
Mark rebuilt my seized 1.7-liter four-cylinder motor.  Big-bore kit, 
porting and polishing, big valves, cam, lightened flywheel, etc.

The whole job cost around $1200... Which was less than what my 
regular mechanic would've charged just to do a stock rebuild.

I brought the engine to him two days before Christmas, and even
though he moved his shop from Venice to Palmdale the next week, it
was ready by the 12th of January (although I did have to hang around 
the shop for a few hours drinking beer while he stayed late to 
finish it up).

All in all, I was very pleased.
