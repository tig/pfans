Hope you don't mind me copying the 914 list in on my reply.  The answers are
my opinions only.  I encourage the list to reply any other opinions.

>What are your recommendations for 5 months of indoor storage?
>Pull battery, or leave in?

The 914 - as well as all Porsches (I am told) - do a very good job draining
batteries.  Therefore, I pull mine for winter and keep it on a
trickle-charger ON A BLOCK OF WOOD.  Don't ever leave a battery lying on the
ground.  (They call it "ground" for a reason.)

Some folks reccomend starting the car every week or so to burn out liquids
in the engine/exhaust system so it doesn't rust from the inside out.

>Blocks or on tires?

I leave mine on tires.  This gives me an opportunity to go out to the garage
every few weeks and roll the car forward and back - so as not to allow flat
spots.  This may not really be necessary, but it allows me an excuse to play
with the car, and to be aware of any other potential problems that may arise.

>Drain fuel tank or not?

I've always been told to store a car with a full tank, so any water content
that may develop in the fuel with be minimized as a percentage of total
fuel/water mixture.

>Would appreciate your thoughts.

Now, my question this year concerns covering the car.  Usually, I have a
standard linin (?) cover.  However, this year I'm considering one of the car
"bags" advertised in many of the mags.  They seem to have a fan to keep air
from being stagnant, while keeping the entire car dry.

My wife uses te garage also for her daily driver, and accordingly tracks
snow and salt, etc... into the garage.

Best Regards,
Jeffrey Dunning
