	Check the FAQ, which can be found at both the Renegade
914 Club's homepage http://www.dgi.net/914 and Tim's 914 Fan
Page, http://www.estinc.com/porsche   This will provide you with
the answers to some of the more obvious questions.

	The brief answer to this question is that 205s will fit
on most (but not all!) stock 914s with stock 914 wheels.  These
cars were essentially hand-built by Karmann, and the bodies vary
enough that a number of them can only fit 195s in the rear.  I
know of at least one car that could not fit a 195 on one side,
but it's unclear whether it had been crashed before or not.
	If your 165s just barely fit, there's a pretty good
chance that your wheels are not stock 914 wheels.  VW Bug wheels
do fit the car, but poorly.  People have reported that a Bug rim
will just barely let you fit a 165 tire.
	Some aftermarket alloys that were made for the 914 do
not quite let the 205s fit on any stock-bodied 914.  The Riviera
wheels are well-known for this.

	Maybe we (someone) should come up with pictures of the
different stock 914 alloys so we can slap them up on a Web page
somewhere.  It would make it easier for folks to figure out what
kind of wheel they have.  Describing the Fuchs with words (or
the differences betwen Pedrinis and Mahles) is not all that easy,
and I can never be sure I've communicated across exactly what I
meant to...
