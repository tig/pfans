Subject: Electrical issues

Here's one for you electrical wizards:
Symptoms:
1)  My ignition switch sticks sometimes.  =

2)  The car stops sometimes when the ignition switch is turned off, but
other
times, only when you press on the brake petal.
3)  The turn signals work but both dash board indicators blink at the sam=
e
time regardless of whether you are turning left or right.
4)  Occasionally while driving the ignition goes off.  The car continues =
to
have spark but runs out of gas (no electric fuel pump).  Gages are dead. =

But
starter motor works.  This can be corrected by turning on the lights whic=
h
appears to "shock" the system into coming back on.  =

5)  There was a anti theft switch wired in under the dash with a toggle
switch.  It appears to be in good working order.
6)  There is a new battery in with a new ground cable (2 months ago).
7)  The starter motor works fine.
8)  All lights and fuses are in good working order with the exception of
the
high beam lights.  They work when you pull back on the headlight flasher
but
do not stay on when you switch to the high beams.<

This may be of some help. I have just purchased my first Porsche which is=
 a
'75 914. Due to DPO's I had mysterious things like you describe, such as
"turn off the ingintion when the headlights are on and the bugger keeps
running". Also, wipers had a mind of their own. I also found out that the=

wiring harness for the dash lights only has one turn signal feed, yet my
tach has a right and left indicator. I suspect that the tach is not OE, s=
o
i have dismissed that problem and wirined a second lamp holder for the
other indicator.
After searching through the Haynes book and the German schematics, all
wiring appeared to be in place. I coincidentally had a goofy front right
directional that decided to use the parking light filament.
I picked up a used fuse block and exchanged wire for wire wheni replaced =

it. Guess what, it was connected wrong by a PO. After working the Haynes
again, the headlight problem went away, completely and wipers work as
advertised. RF blinker was a bad ground.
The really inetersting thing is that when the fuse block wiring was AFU'd=
,
many of the things yuo mentioned happened.
Short story....spend some time with the fuse block and the Haynes book.

Rich Coventry  '75 914 still  trying to be real.
