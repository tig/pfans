          After a weekend of fiddling with the 914 I have some
          worries. I fixed the speedo thanks to DD description on the
          web page. Thank You! 

          Now I have this little problem or question. I have the dual
          sending unit for oil pressure light and guage. I was driving
          on the highway for 3hrs and the car got good and hot. Temp
          guage solidly on the E. I pull off the highway and the
          engine drops to idle and oil light comes on. I shut the
          engine off and let it cool down while I try and figure out
          how I will get home. An hour later I start it and no oil
          light at idle. I drive home and when I pull off the highway
          I get the oil light again. Anyway I put the original sender
          in the car while it was hot. Drove around to get the car
          good and hot again and no oil light. So should I panick and
          tear down my 5,000 mile new motor because something is wrong
          or is the switch for the oil light much higher on the dual
          sender. Oh and I have the high volume oil pump.

          I follow up question the oil PSI guage. I can't get it to
          read anything. If the upside down christmas tree is grounded
          and the + gets 12 volts and the S gets connected to the
          sensor the guage pegs at max over 80 psi with the engine
          off. Any other wiring gets no reading at all engine on or
          off. What gives. I would love to get the guage working so I
          could see what was happening to oil PSI.
