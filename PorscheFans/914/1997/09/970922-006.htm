<< Does it work well on Dirty / Painted metal?  I have a friend who has one
 and he blows a circuit board every time he tries to cut a dirty piece of
 metal.  It now sits in the corner of his shop, he restores Tigers for a
 living.  But I have long thought that a plasma cutter would solve a bunch
 of problems I run into.  But if they can't cut painted or dirty (rusty)
 metal it is no good to me.  Please inlighten me with your experiences so
 far.

Hi Stephen,  I have had no problems with the plasma on dirty or painted
metal at all.  Maybe there is something wrong with his unit.  I did notice 
that on some metal that's really rusty it will have trouble keeping the arc
going.  But I assumed that it was normal because it cannot conduct electicity
that well on the real bad rust.  It's just a matter of stopping and
re-starting it 
more often.  Sometimes you just have to break down and cut it some other
way if it is really bad.

So far I've cut apart two parts cars (ie: rusty) for junk & salvage, and cut
out various 
rusty sections of other cars for repairs.  Last weekend I took out a right
rear
suspension console out of a friends 914 and replaced it  -  all with no
problem
as far as the plasma was concerned (it was a pain in the A#$ though).

I feel it was a good investment and has saved enough time to warrant the 
cost.

Thx,
