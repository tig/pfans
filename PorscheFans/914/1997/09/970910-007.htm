 Thanks to all who responded.  There now be fresh air!  It was a cruddy =
switch.  It seems my PO was a bit of a smoker.  Ashtray...gravity...it's =
an old story.

During the course of this troubleshoot an odd thing occured to me.  That =
is, how unwilling I was to risk blowing a 20-cent fuse.  This occured to =
me when Jim T. was describing how you get answers to "the Question".  =
Sometimes you have to blow a few fuses to get the answer.  Well, it was =
late at night and I was pretty tired....

Thanks again
