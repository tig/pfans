Hi gang!

   I am somewhat surprised by this...  the reason that I made the
statement that I did is that the normal function of a ballast
resistor would preclude it's being located inside the coil, unless
the coil had three terminals.

  The usual purpose of a ballast resistor is to ensure a robust spark
when cranking, especially with a marginal battery and in cold
weather.   This is accomplished by designing the coil to operate
normally on 8 volts or so, rather than the full system voltage of 12
volts.  A ballast resistor is added, sized to provide the remaining 4
volts of drop, so that an 8 volt coil can be operated on a 12 volt
car.
  When cranking, an extra set of contacts on the ignition switch, or
a relay across the starter control circuit is employed to short out
the ballast resistor, placing full system voltage across the coil.  
Thus, even when there is considerable voltage sag in the battery when
cranking load current is drawn from it, there is still enough to meet
or exceed the 8-volt design voltage of the coil, and so there is a
vigorous spark.
   When the engine starts and the key is released, the short across
the ballast resistor is removed, causing the coil to see it's
designed supply voltage of 8 volts, and the points to experience
normal current, improving the life-expectancy of both components.
   In order for the ballast resistor to be included in the coil, the
coil would have to have a third terminal, representing the tap
between the resistor and the coil primary to enable the circuit to
work.  There would also have to be, regardless of the location of the
resistor, an extra set of contacts on the ignition switch or a relay
to accomplish the shorting function.   None of these are present in
the '74 wiring diagram in the Haynes book.
   There is little point to including a resistor in series with a
coil without the above features, as one is simply dissipating energy
in the resistor to no purpose.  Lastly, my Bosch electrics book makes
no mention of ballast resistors in it's discussion of coil ignition,
leading me to believe that Bosch is not enamored of the design (which
I believe originated in Detroit).

   A more probable explanation of Dirk's difficulty ( i.m.h.o.), is
simply that the "hot" coil drew more current (necessary for improved
spark energy) than the stock points were comfortable with.
