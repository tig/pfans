I have 2 sets of rebuildable heads. 
Set (#1) has one side in need of welding of cracks from both spark plugs. the
other side has 2 intake seats that have dropped. The heads have wallered out
from the set being hit by the valve. Some welding will be required.

Set (#2) has no cracks on either side but has one dropped seat and 2 to 3
worn seats. When it dropped its intake seat it shattered and left fragments
in that one cylinder head. Some of the seat did make its way to the other
cylinder head but it is not severe.

I would like to sell both set #I and #2 so I may have the funds to by a set
of heads someone has locally. Both of the sets of heads could be sent to Mark
Stephens and rebuilt for around $210  per head+ S/H.

Please make offers and e-mail or call 770 592 6501 and ask for Doug.
P.S. I also have a 72 914 parts car for sale.
