Dirk and Glenn:

Come on, guys... One of you works for the Patent and Trademark
Office, and the other works at a print shop.  Between the two of you,
you should have a pretty clear idea of basic intellectual-property
law and the "fair use" provisions of current copyright law.

Assuming that Porsche hasn't placed the contents of the manuals in
the public domain [a hundred bucks says they haven't; any takers?],
the law doesn't really allow you to reproduce more than small
portions of the manual.  Even then, that reproduction must generally
be for educational purposes, news reporting, literary criticism, or
the like.

A two-paragraph quote from the manual used here on the mailing list 
in order to clarify a repair procedure is probably ok.  Duplicating 
the entire manual in full color is NOT allowed, whether you sell it 
"at cost", for a profit, or give it away.

The law also doesn't care whether you represent the copy as a 
"genuine Porsche manual", by the way.

The basic idea behind "fair use" is that you're allowed to use
copyrighted material only so long as the copyright holder's rights
aren't infringed upon... I'm not a legal professional (thank God), 
but it sems pretty clear to me that if you copy the whole thing and 
make it publicly available, you'll DEFINITELY be infringing.
