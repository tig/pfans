First off:  A friend of mine would like to subscribe to this list.  What
is the URL to the form?  I can't remember.

Second:  This same friend is looking at tires for his 914.  Currently he
has the GT style flares on it, with a four bolt to five bolt
converter/spacer stuck on.  The front rims are 15x6 with 15x7 rears.
Five bolt hubs are in the works.  Now for the questions:  What kind of
experiences have people had with various tire sizes?  What if the
rolling diameters are different?  How wide a tire can be stuffed under
with the spacers? Without?  Anyway, you get the idea.  Oh yeah, the rims
are the Porsche cookie cutter style (or so I'm told).

You can send him mail directly at john@recfair.com.

Oh yeah, Thanks for all the aftermarket injection advice.  MAN those
things are pricey!

The most likely way for the world to be destroyed, most experts agree,
is by accident.  That's where we come in; we're computer professionals.
We cause accidents.
