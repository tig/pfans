Did you check the pressure in the tires?  Having sat for 2 years, this
is where I would start.  The combination of the clunking and the
"louder-than-normal" exhaust note would have me suspicious of a loose
connection between the muffler and the heat exchangers.  If, however,
you can't really tell if the exhaust is louder, just that it's loud,
then I would follow your assessment and check the CVs.  I've got a
Bursch on mine, and it's always sounded like what you describe...
somewhat quite while coasting, but much louder at WOT.

Good luck,
