I don't think that interior cosmetics is the right question. The most
important thing in determining if a seat is the one you want is if it
fits. If the seat is not comfortable, then you will not be happy sitting
in it, and hence will not drive as well. Of course if the seat was
_really_ cheap, then comfort can be secondary.

The Koenig seat is very pretty yes, and will retain a 'stock' look much
more than other seats will. But is it a race seat? Not a chance. As far
as I know, it is not even FIA approved. And for the money, you could get
a top line sparco, or OMP. If you've got the budget, get a sparco.

DOn't be so down on race seats fitting into a 914. I didn't think that
most race seats would fit either. Then a friend of mine offered me his
used clubman seat, which I had already investigated and thought was too
fat to fit, for very cheap and I tried it. You know what, it fit.
Barely, but it fit. I custom made an adapter bracket to allow me to
retain the unse of the factory rails, and adjusters. The only drawbacks
are that now I need a smaller steering wheel, as the seat has alot more
padding, and raises my legs higher. And that I need to open the door in
order to get access to the parking brake handle. But I did not need to
remove any interior padding or structure. Then again, I'm only 5'6" and
the seat still plenty of room behind it. If you're one of them really
tall folks, then you'll need to shop around very carefully for a seat
that doesn't raise you too high.

If you're spending the dough on a good race seat, stay away from corbeau
or cobra. Build quility on those is not really great compared to sparco
or recaro or OMP.
