Andy, there is a great P-car shop in Boulder. Appelton Specialties,
recomended to me by David Ferguson. However, they probably farm it out.
But the general consensus on the old P-philes list was Bieker
Engineering in L.A. is the best place for head work. You can find the
number in Pano. Ask Steve Compton who he would send his heads to as
well.
