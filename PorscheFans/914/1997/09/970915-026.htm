Hi Marshall!

   The 914 is definitely a tinkerer's car.   Yes, you will find
something to fix every weekend.   Half the fun of owning a 914 is the
satisfaction that comes from repairing and maintaining a car that few
other people (including most "trained mechanics") are competent to
work on.   The down side is that, unless you are going to strip the
thing down to the bare chassis, and only re-install parts that meet
original factory specs for new parts until the thing is completely
re-assembled (a VERY expensive proposition), you will always have a
25-year-old car, with all of the crankiness that that implies.   
   Even if you do go the ground-up full restoration route, you will
still get no better reliability than the car had when new, which
varies from "as good as a VW" to awful, depending on luck, weather,
and how you treat it, which means that we are back to talking about
maintenance again.

   I  hope that the above is of some help to you, but I must conclude
that anyone who is not expecting to invest a fair amount of time and
money in the car will probably end up being dissapointed.   

					Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
