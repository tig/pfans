 I have a "Taiwanese special" wire feed, argon matrix unit.  I think it =
costs about $250 and it runs off a standard 110v outlet.  I had to weld =
a new trunk floor (aft section) with this thing.  My unit has four =
settings and I ended up on the second to the lowest.  The metal that =
you're working with on the 914 is pretty thin and it's easy to blow =
through it (one side of the trunk floor definitly looks better than the =
other).  I didn't take the welding class and I'm sorry I didn't.  I'm =
sure that the other guys on this list have a better way. -- Dave
