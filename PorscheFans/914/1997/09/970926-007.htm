Why when I set timing to what I believe is the specified setting
does the engine run sluggish? ie. idle ~200 rpm and to the point
of sputtering. Here's where it gets complicated...

My 2.0 has a 1.8 impeller (don't ask), so it has no 27 deg mark.
However, I see from Tech Tips 700 that this mark would be one blade
right (passenger side) of a reinforcement bar on the impeller, and
0 deg mark 4 1/2 blades right of the reinforcement bar. The 1.8
impeller has a 7 deg mark 3 1/2 blades right of the bar which I see
on mine. Timing was previosuly set at the bar (3500 rpm, advance hose
disconnected).
When I move it to one blade right of the bar (presumably 27 deg btdc),
it runs real sluggish, even with idle screw turned way out.

I then changed the idle screw adjuster on the brain just a tad
(clockwise a notch then back) and now it hunts at idle now matter
what the setting.

This fiddling is a result of replacing the ignition trigger contacts
which necessitated resetting the timing. Also have newly installed MPS
with no resistor on CHT lead.
I have Compufire ignition unit installed so it shouldn't be the dwell.
I'm trying to get timing correct before I take it in Monday to get the
air/fuel mixture adjusted as result of the new MPS.

Any ideas on how to get timing and idle correct under these circumstances?
Any insight is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
