Halu!

Well it has come time to walk the plank, take a dive off the deep end,
and all those good things.  I am about to walk the Programmable EFI
route, just got my 74 past the dyno emissions test for the last time. 
And there was much rejoicing.

I am currently looking for a Phone# for the Robert Bosch Corp, well
specifically I need the injector group, got a few questions on Ohms of
their various injectors.

The system I will be using reads MAP from a GM sensor and uses a GM TBS
Position sensor and a O2 sensor.  It is a home brew system, also uses the
cylinder temp sensor for warmups.  Very basic and simple stuff.  I will
probably use a set of longer runners and a central Throttle body, much
like the current system.  This is an auto-x car so I am looking for
torque, not high end power.  But I should get some of that also since I
don't have to lean out on the top end.

Sorry no knock sensor or air flow.  I have thought of adapting a GM knock
sensor system, but that requires major ignition changes and finding some
place down in the case close to the #2 or #3 main bearing to take the
readings from.  No, can not do it from the cylinder heads to much valve
train noise.  Anyway monitoring form the main bearings means one sensor
covers all four pistons.  One nice thing about the GM unit it is stand
alone, bad thing is once it retards the timing it stays that way until
you turn off the key.

Also this unit allows for one extra sensor input for data logging
purposes.  It logs RPM, MAP, TBS position, O2 readings, cylinder temp,
and this aux sensor.  I need suggestions on what to monitor. I am leaning
toward gear position or maybe brake activation, but can also do about
anything I want including my own pulse.  Any thoughts? BTW, my G-analyst
takes care of all the vehicle and driver dynamics monitoring.  In other
words it shows me how un-smooth I can be.  It would be nice to have some
useful data, but it can be wired in latter.

Anyway if anybody knows the ohm value for the injectors 2.0L, 1.8L, or
1.7L units and or Bosch's tech line please give me the scope.

Will keep you all posted on the conversion, if all goes well I will have
a complete running 1.8L 74 L-jet system and spare parts for sale latter
this week.  Okay that maybe optimistic, latter this month.

Take care,
Stephen Jacobs
Coming soon - 914 oil pressure and temp / fuel level combo gauge - more
latter on that also.
Only time a man gets all his work done is when he dies, so on that theory
I should live for 200+ years.
