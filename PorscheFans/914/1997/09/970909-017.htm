There have been two different mixture controls discussed in this thread.
The ECU knob is clockwise for rich, and CCW for lean. As for the
pressure sensor adjuster screw, I can't say for sure. But what I can say
is that it's a risky thing to mess around with. There are alot of things
that can go wrong when one starts mucking around with the MPS. Least of
all is damaging the MPS to the point of needing replacement ($$). My
understanding of teh MPS setup is that adjustment of that screw is not a
linear action, and should be done incrementally and carefully. I would
much rather set off-idle mixture by an in-line potentiometer in the Head
Temp sensore circuit.

BTW, JJ, Keep an eye on your MPS. An excessively rich running condition
is one of the more common symptoms of MPS failure. Not that yours has
definately gone bad, but that may be a possible suspect. 

Congrats on getting your car up and running! Just in time for the first
snow of the year! I'm betting on the 20th or so... :)
