Guy,

	What you might be missing is that a RACE SEAT has a job that is
far more important than fit. A Race seat's job is to keep you in one
spot in the event of a crash, not to crack or fold, not break lose but
stay there and save your life. 

If you are looking at race seats, ask yourself how much is you life
worth! And it is not much then go cheap.

Dan

	I don't think that interior cosmetics is the right question. The
most
	important thing in determining if a seat is the one you want is
if it
	fits. If the seat is not comfortable, then you will not be happy
sitting
	in it, and hence will not drive as well. Of course if the seat
was
	_really_ cheap, then comfort can be secondary.

	The Koenig seat is very pretty yes, and will retain a 'stock'
look much
	more than other seats will. But is it a race seat? Not a chance.
As far
	as I know, it is not even FIA approved. And for the money, you
could get
	a top line sparco, or OMP. If you've got the budget, get a
sparco.

	DOn't be so down on race seats fitting into a 914. I didn't
think that
	most race seats would fit either. Then a friend of mine offered
me his
	used clubman seat, which I had already investigated and thought
was too
	fat to fit, for very cheap and I tried it. You know what, it
fit.
	Barely, but it fit. I custom made an adapter bracket to allow me
to
	retain the unse of the factory rails, and adjusters. The only
drawbacks
	are that now I need a smaller steering wheel, as the seat has
alot more
	padding, and raises my legs higher. And that I need to open the
door in
	order to get access to the parking brake handle. But I did not
need to
	remove any interior padding or structure. Then again, I'm only
5'6" and
	the seat still plenty of room behind it. If you're one of them
really
	tall folks, then you'll need to shop around very carefully for a
seat
	that doesn't raise you too high.

	If you're spending the dough on a good race seat, stay away from
corbeau
	or cobra. Build quility on those is not really great compared to
sparco
	or recaro or OMP.
