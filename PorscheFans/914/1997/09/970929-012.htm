OK, for a little imput on the 916 bumper fit string a few days ago....

I just finished fitting the worst 916 bumper probably ever made.  I 
bought it from the Pomona swap for 30 bucks a couple of months ago.  

Not only was the top of the bumper too low (regular 916 bumper problem), 
but the sides lined up for c#*p as well.  Since this car is never going 
to be a show car, I decided to mold the bumper completely to the front 
of the car.  I solid mounted the small sheet metal pieces in front of 
the headlights and solid mounted the bumper to the car at it's four 
mounting bolts (no rubber).  Next I ground the edges of the bumper and 
removed the paint from the fenders of the car and roughened them up with 
100 grit sandpaper.  I used bondo with impregnated strands to build up 
the top of the bumper and mold the bumper into the fenders;  multiple 
layers for strength.  All finish work was all done with good 'ole Bondo 
Pro.

So finally, with multiple layers, and sanding, and layers, and 
sanding..., I got it to all fit.  The result was worth all of the time. 
I think it looks better then the regular 916 bumpers since there is no 
line break from the bumper to the fenders.  The filler with glass strand 
seem to flex fairly well and at this point I dont think it will crack; I 
will update all if it does.

I couldn't find a rear bumper for a decent price so I have been 
fabricating that from scratch....sand, fill, sand, fill....

Anyways, with the molded-in bumpers, and some boxed rockers I found for 
$40 and my 195/60s, this thing is looking pretty aggressive without 
flared fenders.
