I can only answer one, and it's not even a good answer.  Mine is set up
with brass barbs.  I'm sure nylon would work, but who knows?  The
problem I experience with mine is that the fittings hang down about 2
inches off the ground from the front bumper.  Every once in a while,
they'll get whacked pulling into a parking lot or something like that.
If you face a similar situation, make sure you REALLY tighten those hose
clamps, because the oil pressure when cold can pop those hoses off
really quick (it's happened twice to me - no damage, but a big mess).
Now, I've double-clamped the hoses.  So far, it appears to be working
great.
