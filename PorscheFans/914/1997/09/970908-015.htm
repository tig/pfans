Brett,

I would not worry too much if the owners did not know much about the cars.
 The person I bought my 914 from barely knew anything about it.  It seems
that many people who own 914's are not into the car, but just that it is a
Porsche and its a sports car or as you put it they want a "racy, babe
magnet".  The thing you should be most concerned about is his/her driving
habits, was it serviced regularly, and make sure it has service RECORDS.  

good luck
RWB     72 914
