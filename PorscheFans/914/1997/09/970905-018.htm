Well, thank god for curiousity! It looks like one of the output transistors
in your ecu box is blown. There's one per pair of injectors. White would
mean either extremely lean or nothing at all. You have to check the
injectors themselves while the engine is cranking. This means pull either
#1 or #4, hold it over a container and crank the engine. If no gas squirts
out, then you've got s FI problem. Black plugs means rich.
