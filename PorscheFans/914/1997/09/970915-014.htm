While my gas tank is out so I can replace leaky hoses I decided to pull the
fresh air fan and figure out its problem.  Jammed and burned due to about a
pound of leaves and crud from PO parking under trees.  Lucky I have a spare
from parts car that I can clean up.

Questions:
The motor is dirty and other than blowing it off, can I use something like
electrical contact cleaner on it?
What about the bearings/bushings on the ends. Any particular lube I could
use or just leave alone?
The plastic drain hoses broke in several places when removing them.  I was
just going to use rubber hose to replace them, any problems anyone can
think of from doing this?
I've got some wire cable lube and an adapter from my old motorcycle. Going
to use this on the cables from the fresh air/heater controls unless someone
can see a problem with this.

Think I'll put some kind of screen over the top when I reinstall the unit
to keep the largest leaves out.  Those that hadn't gotten into the old
motor had clogged up the drain hoses and had a nice 1/4" of mulch in the
bottom of the pan.

Oh, I have some Meguiar's #42 Rubber Treatment and I've been using that on
the rubber seals, around the top of the freah air fan housing, and on the
foam rubber like seals on the ends of the fan housing.  Seems to work
fairly well in softening and revitalizing them.  I've been using this on
other rubber seals and seems to work.  For visible rubber, like the bumper
caps I first clean them with a citrus degreaser, the use Black Again till
looks like I want it, then top coat with the Meguiars.  Looks good.
