Should you buy a 914?
Just my  $.02 regarding 914 ownership. I am on my 2nd in 2 years. The
first, a 73 1.7 w/ webers, ended up being salvaged due to its cancerous
rust and lack of right rear suspension. Thankfully, I found local buyers
for almost every little part possible (kinda like the Indian and the
Buffalo).I then bought a 75 1.8 and used all the good parts possible on
it (incl. wheels, tires, steering wheel, stereo, seats, etc.). Mine is a
daily driver and I have never once had it fail me except a dead old
battery in the snow. It jumped and I went straight to Al's for a new one.

I have had 3 previous air cooled VW's and I believe I have used all that
experience keeping this Porsche running. My car has only been in the shop
once for pre-emmission test adjust to the FI. I rebuilt the entire
braking system, Distributor, added elec ignition, of course I do my own
valves, changed exhaust, steering wheel and numerous little detail and
body tweeks. I've never had to take the engine out once and I hope I
don't ever.
But If someone asks if they should get a 914, no matter how nice it
appears, I wouldn't reccommend it for a primary car unless they are a nut
like myself--I like the work, this list and the swap meet, etc. There are
just too many reliable econoboxes and other "sporty" cars available with
little or no work involved (or work that can easily be handled by a
shop). Unless your wallet is huge and you  *can* find a shop who will do
the work (remember, some Porsche shops won't work on 14's, and most VW
shops) you shouldn't be driving one. My two favourite parts stores (Brys
Salvage and BowWow) know me by name if not by face and take my money
happily. But my green and primer car looks a sight, not a status symbol.
But I know when I see and hear a nice 914 on the road, I can appreciate
it for a result of someones hard work, and that is worth flashing my
foglights in appreciation. But when some "Gold Chainer" cuts me off in
his late model 911 in a fit of misplaced testosterone ('Mines faster than
your"), I just chuckle and pity the next owner of that abused auto.
Thanks for letting me vent
Nick
