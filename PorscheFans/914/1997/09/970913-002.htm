The following report of what I found inside my MPS (and lived to drive
again) is a repost by request. The question was "Will it go back
together without needing readjustment?" I would say, yes, if you don't
change the position (in or out) of the internal adjustment screw. When
you fasten the top back down the original tension should be restored.

Also note: the Automotion rebuilt MPS units appear to all come with the
air vent facing up where it could fill with water. The simple solution
is to remove the top and rotate the vent so that it faces down in the
914.

Listen Up D-Jet fourtiners:

I would stronly advise against pumping more than 10 in hg vacuum when
testing your Manifold Pressure Sensor. I found out the hard way.

Last week I reported that my pressure sensor no longer held vacuum,
although the engine ran well enough. Thanks to encouragement from James
K. Thorusen, I drilled out the rivets and peeked inside mine to see if I
could seal it up.  Well here's what I found. 

The hose connection half contains the wiring and coils. That's as far as
I went there, because it is open to the engine and not a source of any
leak.

The back half contains a pair of aneroid bellows, that sit between the
coil unit and the adjustment mechanism (the little screw hidden
underneath the epoxy sealed plug if you ever go that far). 

The leak was in a paper-thin copper diaphram that seals the end of the
vacuum chamber that containes the bellows and electronics. It had
cracked about 3.4 way around the center from fatigue. The adjustment
screw rides in the center of this diaphram.  

It appears this diaphram functions as the altitude correction system the
D-Jet modification thread has was discussing. Remember one side is
vented to the atmosphere, the other is in the chamber that sees manifold
vacuum. The diaphram is flexible enough to move inward in response to
engine vacuum. How much it moves depends on the atmospheric pressure on
the other side. 

Here's where the warning comes in. Ordinarily, the engine pulls no more
that 10-in. Hg at idle (highest vacuum). When you (or I) connect a
Mityvac to the sensor port and pump away it is easy to generate over
20-in. of vacuum, probably closer to 30 if you just had your coffee. I
do not think this diaphram likes this at all, since if it were any
thinner it would be foil. In testing over the last two years or so, I
probably did more to create the metal fatigue than in 20 years of
driving. Now I've got to order a new pressure sensor. Ouch.

John Muir suggested sucking on the hose end to test sensor vacuum
holding. Sounds good to me.
