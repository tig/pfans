Seeing as how this was posted to the 914 list, I'll asume that you're
interested in 914s. For $15k, you can get an immaculate 4-cylinder 914
(with lot's of money left over), or a decent 914-6. But if you're
looking for a car that won't require much maintenance, then either buy a
completely restored and rebuilt 914-4, or a 911SC. The SC will not be
rebuilt for that price, but the motor is bombproof, and there are plenty
of SCs out there that havn't been abused to death yet. If it were me?
I'd probably get an older 911S or a good 914-6. $15k can buy alot of car
if you're patient and look carefully. But just about any used P-car will
be more maintenance intensive than a honda. If it's an appliance you
want, then get an appliance. I'm not trying to steer you away, but I do
want to say that owning a used Porsche will entail at least some level
of maintenance. That level will pretty much be determined by the effort
the previous owner made in keeping the car in top running condition.

Well, I'm really not a Guru status. but there are one or two bonafide
Gurus on this list. 'Guru' is really overused this day and age...
