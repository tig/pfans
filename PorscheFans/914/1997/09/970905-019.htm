I have a '73 1.7, but I think the drill is the same.

I've had good and bad luck.  Here's what I look for:

1:  A shop that knows the cars.  There's a smog shop in Concord
    CA that lists the prices on the wall.  There's seperate columns
    for 4-cylinder air cooled (bugs, 914's) and 6-cylinder (911).

    Translation:  They know that the cars will take a little
    longer to pass.

2:  A shop that pre-tests.  This is a *lot* more important now.

    A pre-test runs the car through all of the tests, with the
    connection to the "state computer" disconnected.

    If the car fails the pre-test badly, you can go away and fix
    it _without_ the state tagging it as a gross polluter.

3:  A shop that likes the cars.  Or hates the law.  I go to a
    place in SF where the mechanic is _still_ fuming about the
    change in diesel fuel a couple of years back.

    (He does have a sign displayed that says: "No British Cars")

    He has always gotten it to pass, and has always left it
    in good running condition.  Cost?  $45.00

4:  Look at the driveway.  If you see only new mini-vans, this
    is not the shop for you.  If you see 914's, 911's, VW buses
    and the like, head on in.

    Do not expect "Smog Pros" or "Bob's Chevron" to be able to do the
    test.  Unless the owner is on this list.


YMMV,
