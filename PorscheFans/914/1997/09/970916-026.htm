There's only three or four bushings in the whole system, and as far as I
can tell they all wear. Splurge a little, spend the $20, and change them
all. As for the smell, think of this as the air cooled "bouquet of
VW-Porsche performance", and get used to it.  Unless you have some
severe exhaust leaks causing CO to enter the system, realize that the
air is drawn in for this heat from the engine bay, and they basically
all smell that way.
