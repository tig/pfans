Well all I am cleaning out my garage again.  And getting ride some parts
not needed.

I have a set of SS 1.7L / 1.8L heat exchangers in pretty good overall
shape.  Few dents some oil stains, but very functional.  I would like to
sell them for $125 for the pair.

I have an original 1.7L muffler, surface rust but no holes, may be gutted
on the inside it is loud.  $30

I have a 1.7L bursch collector tuned pipes I will sell for $20, muffler
is gone, but the pipes are in nice shape.

And I have got side windows and rear windows buy the stacks, like 5
complete sets.  Need a window make me an offer.  No front windows.

1 Plaid 914 passenger seat in nice condition red and white plaid, no
tears , rips, holes of any kind.  Also have the lower cushions and
backpad for the drivers seat, also in like condition.  $100 takes all of
it.  Not bad looking, but does not match my brown interior.

Buyers pays shipping and any duty or VAT that may be applicable.

More to come as I dig deeper into this stuff.

Take Care,

Stephen Jacobs
