Jim,

Funny you should ask.  

I found the correct bolt/thread size combination at a local home
improvement store (in stainless fashion), but the bolt was too short, and
the hex head was too big without cutting up the cooling tin.  What I did
was take the bolt, clamp it down real good in a vise, and cut it off
leaving about 3/4" of thread.  I then cleaned up the cut on my bench
grinder and cut a slot on the flat spot with a dremel tool.

Put a small amount of locktite on the threads, and screw it in.  No torgue
settings, but as tight as I could by hand.  I don't know if this is the
best way to do it, but it has held up well (I've checked a couple of
times), and the motor has lived at redline a lot lately (due to some very
fast autox courses) with no problems yet.

Hope this helps, because I had a bitch of a time trying to find the correct
thread size/length combination.  I think it was 10/100 or something like that.

Good Luck,

DD
