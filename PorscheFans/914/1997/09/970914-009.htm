 Marshall,
    You need to check out the "Why a 914?" essay on Tim Jones' 914 Fan Page.
I think it says alot.  I bought a 914 1.8L two years ago and have
essentially re-created it.  Not to concours, but to my liking.  I have
touched every part of the car.  I bought and rebuilt a 2.0L engine and
stuffed it in.  New suspension, brakes, exhaust, interior, and paint.  I
will admit that toward the end of the project (as the aggregate expense was
approaching the cost of a 2-year old Z-28) I was wondering at my folly.
I put the car on the road this weekend.  It was a terrific time.  The first
time I carried speed into a corner, felt the car take a "set" and strafe the
apex....ahhhhhh.  I don't think you can find a more exquisitely balanced car
outside of a full-race set up.

   I think MR2's are nice cars, too.  I just don't like anti-freeze.   I
don't know if you have to fall in love with a 914 first in order to put one
back on the road properly...but it sure helped me.

Regards,
Dave

Subject: Is the 914 right for me?



I have toyed with the idea of purchasing a 914 for several years but didn't
have the nerve
to try it: too many things that can go wrong, its cold blooded heritage that
will leave it stall
on a December morning right as I cross the train tracks...you get the idea.

Just drove a '74 2L, had a great time...but was appalled at the amount of
work it
needed...and this was one in good condition!

Concerning maintanence, I am checked out on the VW Type I,II,III engines,
have done
all of my own work, engine replacements, etc for years. But I don't have
time to be taking
the car apart every weekend anymore; the halcyon days of college are gone.

So, what I am (to make a sort story a novel) is a chap that earnestly wants
to get into this
racket 'cause he loves these cleverly designed cars, but is hesitant because
of all of the
troubles he has seen with them. So, HONESTLY, what are your maintenance
experiences like? Is it in the shop every fortnight? Or more often? Or less?
I would be
using this kind of car as a daily driver; am I asking for trouble? What is
the realistic
expense for parts, or would I be better off to sigh and go buy an MR2?


Much thanks in advance for any wisdom you might have.


Marshall
