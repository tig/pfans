Bill's note to me:

I got the center console and gauges.  I am very disappointed.  The console
is somewhat broken and seems to be missing the top bracket and the screws.
The gauges are in poor shape, the glass is fogged in the inside like they
got wet and the bezels are not real clean.  The clock does not work, though
you said it might not.
This is alot worse than just needing recovering.  Bill S.

Bill, I pulled the console out last night.  The oil temp, voltmeter, and
clock are present.  I dont know if the clock works.  The top of the console
has been trimmed to approx 4 inches below the bottom of the dash.  The
console also needs to be recovered.  I will sell the console for $25
without the guages.  Another $25 for the guages.



Now my response to Bill,

Bill, I did not reply because you did not ask a question of me.

If you had wanted concours parts you should have said so.  I would not have
sold you the parts.  $25 for a console is an excellent price by any
standars.  An additional $25 for guages and oil temp sender is a steal.
For that price I will not clean the parts for you!  With UPS on strike the
shipping cost me $24. Yes, we made the deal before UPS went on strike and I
felt obligated to ship you the parts for the price agreed and did not want
to ask for more money to cover the extra shipping so I ate it.

If there is something wrong with the deal that I made I want to know (from
anyone).  If you want you money back I will happily return it minus
shipping cost once I receive the parts back.  Your choice.
