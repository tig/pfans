>Is it possible to take a 911 vented disc caliper, remove the spacers

Hey Dirk,

I'm not sure of the mounting bolt spacing, but the 911's had an ~3" spacing
for the older (pre '74) M calipers, and another ~3.5" spacing for the later
A and (all) S calipers.  No spacers are used.  But even if they bolt on, I'm
not sure how they will help if you don't go to 5 bolt wheels, as the 911 rotors
are bolted onto the hub, while the 914's are integral.  Plus I believe the
bearings are different; certainly, the adjusters don't interchange.  This
based on me playing with '73 and '86 911 front ends, and '73 and '74 914
front ends.

Now, I know a person who used early 911 calipers with the stock 914 rotors
to get a bigger pad, but this was before the 320i brake conversion.

All this is from my spotty memory, so take with a pound of salt.
Good luck!
Mike
