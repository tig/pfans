If you have a garage, it'll be there "often." The problem with these cars is
that some repairs are just really hard to do, so previous owners don't do
them. Also, some parts are really expensive, which is another disincentive.
Pile on top of that the disdane for the car by other Porsche people, and you
have a receipe for many basket cases and few really good cars.

Yes.

VW parts for Porsche prices. Nobody said it was easy to join this club.
You've gotta be tough, you've gotta be willing to pay 200$ for a piece of
rubber trim, you've gotta be able to stand tall when those 911 owners laugh
at you. Not everyone makes it. It takes guts and determination to own one of
these cars. You've got to be a fanatic, you've got to be mechanically
talented, and you have to really want to lie on your back on the ground to
work on these cars. Buying an MR2 is a copout for the true 914 crowd. If all
we wanted was easy transportation, we'd all own Hondas. Be all you can be,
buy a 914.
