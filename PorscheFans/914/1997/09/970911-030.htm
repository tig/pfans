Question is does any one have a turning signal assembly ( Steering
column part)
The tab on the high / low beam switch broke.  It worked fine before, but
it magically broke when the inspector tried it, after having to tell
this clown how to find first,after two stalls and almost hitting the car
parked behind me, I didn't think that he couldn't figure out the high
beams too, to make a long story short he hated me , my car which made
him look stupid, so It failed due to his over zealous bud drinking paw.
It was insane how irked this guy was.The inspection took 30 minutes, he
really looked at everything - except the carbs.  so if there is a part
out there please respond.
of after reading all the recent deal info, the part needs to look decent
( how bad could it look?), and work - low dollar amount would be good
too.

oops, it's a 73 1.7
