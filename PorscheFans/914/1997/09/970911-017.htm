Dean,

	If you indeed have the Fuchs alloys (pseudo 4 spoke appearance, eight
somewhat rectangular holes), they will most likely accomodate up to a
205/60-15 tire. All 914s were handbuilt, and as a result, there are
variances in construction. Some 914s amy only be able to accomodate 195
width tires under the original fenders. But the general consensus is if
you have Fuchs (they have the correct backspacing) you can get 205s
under there. I know it doesn't look like it'll fit, but it more than
likely will. As a matter of fact, there are some of us (like me ;) who
have mangaed to shoehorn 225s under the stock fenders. Ok, so there's a
wee bit of rubbing, but these are my competition wheels and tires and
don't see street use.
