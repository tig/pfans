Steve,

Well I use a Lincoln 110 Mig Pac with the gas kit and easy grind wire. 
Let me tell you as long as you don't get into metal larger than .25" this
thing will do great.  I have welded larger stuff with multi pass
techniques, but for sheet metal this thing is great.  I can't say enough
about it.  The 914 is made of 22ga sheet metal bent and formed to create
a strong structure.  A Mig is the only thing (except TIG) that you will
be able to successfully weld with, with out a huge ramp up in learning. 
I also installed Rich Johnson's 14 ga stiffing kit, and it went perfect. 
The minor rust repair was very easy.  A Mig was one of the best tool
investments I have made. Of course I tell my wife any tool I buy is the
best tool I ever bought. 

 Now if I am just as impressed with my HVLP turbine paint spray setup I
got from TIP, I am hoping I am really hoping.

Take Care,

Stephen Jacobs
