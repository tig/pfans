	The 914 is a hand-built car.  Therefore, not all cars are equal,
especially in the fender clearance area.  I think that most cars will
have some rubbing on the front inner fender at full lock with 205s, and
many (including mine) rub at full lock with 195s.  This on factory Fuchs
alloys.
	Most people who have this size of tire figure out about the rub-
bing pretty quickly, and simply decide not to turn the wheel full lock
unless they really really have to.  The tire still does fit, you simply
have to be a little careful.
	The really difficult fitment problems are at the rear of the car.
Some 914s will fit 205s in the rear fenders just fine, some will only
fit them on one side, while a few of them won't fit 205s on either side.
