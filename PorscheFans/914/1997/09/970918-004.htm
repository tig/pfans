OK, I win the dummy award for spring compressors. 

Last night I went to install my freshly painted rear springs on my rebuilt
Konis, so I get out the compressor and squeeze the coil down. (anyone who
says you can get the coil on there without a compressor is crazy in my
opinion) But, I didn't grab enough coils to compress the spring enough to
get the nut on the shock shaft. So, I uncompress the spring, grab another
coil, recompress and finally get the nut on. Then I go look at my old
coilover sets and realize that they have the snubber and a few other parts
that I forgot to put on the new coilover. So, I recompress the new spring
and take it off the shock. When I go to expand the coil, I realize that I
grabbed too many coils and I ran out of screw thread on the compressor
before the coil was loose enough to get the compressor off of the spring. I
try to compress the spring with my weight, but it ain't compressing enough.
Duh. I gave up and went home. 

So, now I have to recompress the spring, put it on the shock, screw on the
nut, remove the compressor, compress the old coilover, remove the parts,
expand the old spring, recompress the new one, put the parts on it, and
finally re-expand the coil. I just know I'm gonna wear out that compressor
getting these things together. :)
