	First things first.  Check the ignition system.  Timing and
dwell, if you can get the car to run well enough to check them.  The
condition of the components (points, condensor, plugs, wires, cap,
rotor).  Make sure you're getting a good spark.
	This is always the first step in troubleshooting an FI problem.

	Hmmmm...  What else, what else...  The cold start valve will
squirt in extra fuel when the engine is cold-cold.  I had a problem
where it stayed open, causing problems on warm start.  That shouldn't
flood the motor on a cold start, though.
	Just in case, you might want to un-plug the electrical con-
nector and try starting the car.  That will check the wiring and the
thermo-time switch.  If you still flood, you can clamp off the fuel
hose to the cold start valve (left-rear corner of the manifold) and
see if it still floods.  If you are at all unsure about the condition
of your fuel hoses, don't do this part.  It could cause a fuel leak,
which is bad news at 29 PSI.
	Check the condition of the wiring between the head temp sensor
and the ECU.  A break in the wire will cause the engine to go full-
rich and you'll flood.  Ditto a bad connection between the sensor and
the wiring harness.

	On third thought, the connection is probably your primary
suspect.  Next most likely is the wire, while the cold start system is
a rather unlikely culprit.

	Good luck!
