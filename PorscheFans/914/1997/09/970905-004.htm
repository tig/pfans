I know the dealer refuses to make copies of any portion of the manual,
citing copyright protection. But, I think that as long as you don't have an
intent to duplicate the manual and pretend to sell it as a genuine porsche
manual, and you don't reproduce the entire thing, you might be ok. But,
what does the copyright notice say in the front of the manual? You might be
ok if you reproduce only small portions of the manual. If you really want
to be safe, consult a lawyer. Porsche also may have let the copyright
expire, but I don't know how you can check up on that.
