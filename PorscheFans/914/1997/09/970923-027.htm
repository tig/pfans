  Well a few weeks a friend talked me into taking his dead 914  ( of 4 yrs)
 off his hands. 
So now I have a 74 1.8  with all that ill fitting fiberglass stuff somwhat
attached,(front & rear bumpers , rocker panels or side boards ) a freshly
rebuilt engine with soposed F.I. problems.   After draining off a bunch of
gas and refilling with fresh stuff , pulling out injectors and manually
opening (with a small nail, probly real dumb !) and running carb cleaner thru
them ,replacing battery, priming fuel system, checked fuel pressure  ,checked
ok.  It started right up , didnt run well but ran.I sanded about 1/2 pound of
rust off roters so weels would turn freely.So now I had to go for a ride
 went half way around the block and realized  rear calliper was dragging real
bad. Got home cooled it down with the hose and got the Haynes book out.
pulled off the pad and followed the venting adjustmentre assembled and still
drags after using the brakes.
 1   Does anyone have an idea short of replacing calliper ( haynes said you
can't rebuild the rears )
 2  Fuel guage adjusts with dashlight dimmer ?
 3  I havn't been able to find much info on the L-jet  F.I.
     Thanks in advance for any help
