On my '70 2.0 (an expanded 1.7), I also had my stock hubs/rotors, etc
bored and fitted out and 911 lugs put in.  I was then able to get the
regular 911 cookie cutters on.  I was a bit worried about strength, but
they seemed to hold up really well. Of course I didn't do any racing
like most of you guys.  Oh, yeah, one lug DID work itself loose from the
weld. And there was a bit of minor rubbing up front, but only at
extreme/full turn.  Can't remember the sizes.

Anyway, they looked great.  It was great to pick up the car from the
Porsche dealer guys (after some work not involving the engine) to have
them ask me where I got this 914/6!  Of course, HAD i met up with a real
6, I would have been in real trouble.

Those little hangers baffled me too.  Aside from a tie, which would then
hang down in the air channel behind the seat, what could possibly fit
there?  I did figure out that they were for the seat belts.  Seems to me
I saw a happenstance picture of it somewhere in the '70 owner's manual--
or a Haynes.
