914's have been my daily drivers most of the time for the last 18 years.
I do everything myself except machine work.  I'm now on my fourth one,
as two were destroyed in accidents (not my fault.)  I cannot recommend
any old car unless you do your own work.  My cars have been as good as
the care I have given them.

Porsche Parts Prices are high.  I can't remember the last time I had to
buy anything from a dealer.  With this list, the 914 is quite reasonable
to maintain.

Except for rust, the 914 is rugged.  No car is immune from failing due
to neglect.  "Cars don't wear out, people just stop spending money on
them first."  


A 911 or 928?  Why would you want a high-priced car with a silly little
(statutory) back seat where the engine belongs?

Cheers,
