I just finished a complete engine rebuild on a '74 2.0 for my sister and
her husband. They are now in route from where I live, (southeast Wyoming)
to their home in the south bay area of CA.

They called last night to report that the car ran flawlessly on the first
leg of the trip (to Wendover, NV - 670 miles) except for about the last 30
or so miles in which it cut out and stumbled if driven in 5th gear above
3200-3400 rpms. In 4th, they reported it running well above that rpm range.
The other symptom is that the tach needle fluctuates wildly while the
engine is cutting out.

This leads me to believe that it might be an electrical problem as opposed
to a fuel delivery issue.

Any thoughts or BTDTs as to what might be going on here? The engine is a GA
series 2.0 with D-Jet injection, stock cam, and 8-to-1 P/Cs. My suspisions
right now are 1- head temp. sender, although that doesn't explain why it's
better in 4th gear than 5th. (My past HTS experiences are that when it
goes, it goes. Nothing intermittent) 2- TPS. 3- clogged fuel filter, can't
account for erratic tach action, and it was just replaced. 4- coil.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

regards,

john
