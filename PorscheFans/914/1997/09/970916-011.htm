I need to dissagree here a bit. Yes, higher revs will always reduce
engine life, but don't discount the toll that higher CR takes. Higher CR
means higher temps in the combustion chamber and the head(s). Certainly
a 'stock' built BMW 6-banger will not even last 1 minute above 9000 rpm.
I have first hand eveidence of this one example. Yes, rpms can kill, but
take any motor and bump the CR way up and even though you don't change
the RPM range, you will drastically reduce the engine life. Naturally
cooling _has_ to be addressed when this is done, and if we're talking
air-cooled than it gets to a threshold where heat can't be dissapated
quickly enough. But I know of a EP 1.8 914 engine that runs above 7000
rpm at 13.5:1 CR and lasts an entire racing season.

All depends on how well one can cool one's engine.
