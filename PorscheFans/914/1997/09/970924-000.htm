Try parking uphill. Seriously. I parked my '76 in an area slightly
downhill and with its ill-fitting new rubber and badly adjusted door
frames, my carpet came out pretty damp. So, I parked it at a slight
incline so the water travelled to the rear of the gutters and I was
pretty much problem-free. And I too have a gas gauge that's slightly
more optomistic when the lights are on. I figure there's a small bump in
voltage reaching the gauge when you turn the suckas on and it's just a
factory quirk. I've learned not to trust my gas gauge, only my reserve
light, which I think ought to be much brighter so I can see the darn
thing during the day! I can't tell you how many 914 guys I know have
asked me to help them fix their cars which don't run, only to find out
their reserve lights are on, and have been for a while, even though
their gauges read a 1/4 tank. "Add gas," I say , and thus end the house
call. They do listen and put some gas in the tank, and then tell me ,
rather embarrassed, that after doing so their cars now run. Anyway, if
you haven't figured it out by now, watch for the reserve light, as that
will tell you the whole truth.
