O.K., I'm either getting really close, or I've taken a few steps
backwards.  Last night I decided to clean all of my grounds in the
on-going attempt to fix my erratic FI problems.  Once completed, the car
is definitely behaving differently, but I don't think it's better... I
think it's worse.  Before I cleaned the grounds, the car drove
wonderfully and had gobs of power... unless it was idling or I was
driving at a constant RPM.  Under those circumstances, the engine would
miss, causing an erratic idle, and bucking while driving.  Now, the idle
seems a little smoother, and the bucking at constant RPM is about half
of what it had been, but, under full throttle, the car appears to have
about half the power it did yesterday, and sounds like its struggling to
rev.  It feels like either the fuel isn't being completely combusted, or
the timing is way off, again, causing incomplete combustion.  My
mentality on these repairs has been "One-thing-at-a-time", but this time
I did make two changes.  I installed a K&N air filter in addition to
cleaning the grounds.  I really can't see that having anything  to do
with this, but you never know.  I'm hoping this behavior will ring a
bell with someone, so here's what I've come up with:

1.  The grounds had been bad before I cleaned them, and the mechanic
adjusted the fuel mixture (both on the ECU and the MPS) with the bad
grounds.  Now that the grounds are cleaned and fixed, the mixture is way
off, and simply needs to be re-adjusted.

2.  The grounds had been good, but in my attempt to clean them, I
screwed them up.  Now, the mixture is way off, both at idle and WOT.

3.  My attempt to clean the grounds did nothing, but coincidentally,
some mechanical failure occurred.  Now, the engine is developing half
its original power.

So, if I am dealing with an incorrect fuel mixture, then how do I adjust
it without an exhaust gas analyzer?  Does it sound like it's rich, or
lean?  My understanding is that there are two "mixtures"; idle and
driving.  If this is the case, then the idle is adjusted at the ECU, and
the driving mixture is adjusted at the MPS, right?  How do I determine
if I'm even in the ball park on these settings?

As usual, any and all advice (or criticism) is greatly appreciated...
without it, I wouldn't even be this far!

Thanks again,
