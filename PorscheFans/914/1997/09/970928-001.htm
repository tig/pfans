Learn how to weld (seriously).

You have a lot of work ahead of you. If the passenger floor is shot, then
most likely some other more difficult areas are completely gone. First
check the area under where the battery goes and the firewall. Hell, skip
the floor and fix these areas first. These areas are structural, the floor
is only partly so. You're going to have to pull the motor to get to them,
though, so I hope you have a good garage space that you can leave the car
in pieces for long time. But even before all of this, check to see if the
car is straight. Take it and get a four wheel thrust alignemnt. This will
tell you if all four wheels line up. Also, do Dave's big butt test for
chassis sag. Hope thishelps.
