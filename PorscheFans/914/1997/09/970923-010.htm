Well I'm really in to it!!  My 2.0L #4 intake valve needed opening 4 times in
2000 miles, spark plug pure carbon and adjustment screw ended up out an extra
1/4 inch. I pulled the engine, stripped it down and removed the heads,  made 15
drawings during process and videotaped each step, labeling everything (I'm inept
but not stupid!). Yup the seat was gone, will put in Timeserts as needed. 
Rebuild is being done by Dan Hall's Automotive who come highly recommended by
several locals!
Questions: 1) the short, cloth/rubber tubes joining the air delivery tubes to
the air box, were leaking, is there a special way to put them on? 2) should I
retorque the case bolts? 3) I would like to replace the gas tubing and there is
a great local commercial outfit which stocks all types of tubing.  What should I
use?  Thanks for your patience I really have millions of questions but I'd like
to have some Porschefans friends left!!!###*! But all rebuild suggestions
welcomed!!
