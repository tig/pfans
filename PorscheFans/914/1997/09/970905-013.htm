That's enough folks!

	Ok, so you got burned on a deal you had with someone on the net. Maybe
they snaked your part, or missrepresented it. Or maybe not, maybe you're
just sour that whatever it is you bought isn't in perfect condition.

	SO WHAT.

Please don't air your dirty laundry here unless BOTH PARTIES have agreed
to use the net as a "neutral" arbitrator. Otherwise, dragging someone
elses name through the mud smacks of slander. I don't think we need this
kind of thing here. And I think I speak for the majority of us here.

Now I don't remember what the "welcome to P-fans" mail says, but I
remember way back to the glory days of Prschephilles, the welcome
message had a very explicit section on sales of parts to fellow list
members. It was long and detailed, but it basically boiled down to
"Caveat Emptor" - Buyer Beware. If you're unsure about what part you're
getting, investigate it. If you think the price is unfair, then don't
buy it. 

Ok, I've said my peice. If you want to flame me, go ahead. It all goes
to the null file anyway. I'll get off my soap box now. Now where's Unka
Bart when ya need him...
