Dean, the first thing that you must do is positively identify the type
of wheels that you have on the car. If they're that close with 165's,
they're probably not the Fuchs. Automobile Atlanta's catalog has plenty
of illustrations of various 914 wheels, this may help. You should have
this catalog, even if there is less than a universal endorsement of AA's
products and customer service, because it is packed with info helpful to
the novice.
