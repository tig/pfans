	As someone already pointed out (I think it was only on the PFans
list), the L-jet system uses the "double relay" mounted on/near the bat-
tery tray to control the fuel pump and to control power to the ECU.  The
round relays on the relay board are not used, except for the heater blower
relay.  (And the rear window defroster relay, if that system is installed.)
	If you think the fuel pump is not running, you can turn the igni-
tion key to "on" (not "start") and move the flap in the air flow meter by
hand.  This should signal the double relay to turn on the fuel pump.

	The engine needs four things to start.  The engine needs to be
turning over, it needs air getting into it, it needs fuel, and it needs
a spark.  The last two things need to happen at some approximation of the
right time, too.
	Craig, do you know which of the four (or five, counting timing) is
off?  The air is probably OK, unless you are hearing lots of ugly noises
when you turn the motor over.
	If the car isn't turning over, you need to check the starter and
associated stuff.  If it is, but you're not getting any spark, then you
need to examine your ignition system.  If there's a spark, then you can
start checking the fuel system.
	We can make more intelligent suggestions when we hear what part of
the system is failing.
