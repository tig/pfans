As many of you know, for the last 5 months I've been hunting an elusive,
erratic FI problem.  I've changed the plugs, changed the plug wires,
soldered many of the FI connections, replaced the fuel filter, changed
the oil, adjusted the valves, inspected everything, fixed tons of vacuum
leaks, cleaned the distributor, filed the trigger points, tested every
FI sensor 3 times, adjusted the timing, replaced the throttle body,
swapped manifold pressure sensors, and checked the grounds.  As of
yesterday, I was experiencing a problem where the car appeared to loose
half of its power, and felt like complete combustion just wasn't
happening.  Well, while re-doing my ground strap, I got a little curious
about the fuel mixture, so I pulled the #1 plug.  It was white - not
tan, more like ash.  Up to this point, every time I pulled a plug, it
was black.  Rather than stopping there, I checked #2... it was black.
So, of course, I checked the other two; #3 was black as well, but #4 was
white.  A quick check of the wiring diagram revealed that #1 and #4 fire
together, and #2 and #3 fire together.  I attacked all of the grounds
once more, since that's the only thing that I've changed since this
behavior started.  I'm going to replace the connectors at the ground on
top of the bell housing, and with any luck, all four cylinders will
behave the same once again.  My question is; do the white plugs indicate
that they were firing, and the black plugs were not, or is it just the
opposite, or is it possible that I had a rich mixture on #2 and #3, and
a lean one on #1 and #4?

Once again, thanks for everyone's help!
