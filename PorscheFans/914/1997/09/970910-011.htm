I remember reading an article somewhere once (Road & Track?) about how
pride guarantees your car will break down.  Well, sure enough, I proved
this last night.  As many of you know, I finally got my car running
perfect... no stumbling, stuttering, backfiring, missing, or other
nonsense.  I decided to call the closest mechanic to my house to see if
I couldn't bring the car over and fine-tune the mixture so I could pass
emissions.  He said sure, so I happily cruised over.  Along the way, I
passed other P-Car owners who turned their heads and waved.  I, of
course, turned my head and waved as well.  What a wonderful feeling!  I
couldn't help but feel a certain sense of pride in accomplishing what my
mechanic had failed to do.  I arrived at the shop (I'd never been there
before), parked the car, and went in.  The owner told me to bring the
car around to the door.  I fired it up, cruised to the door, got out,
and noticed that my car was idling somewhere in the vicinity of 300 rpm.
He hooked it up to the EGA, and it was immediately blowing between 6 and
7 percent CO, with the HCs off the scale.  What the hell?  As I sat
pondering what could have changed in the last 20 seconds, he starts
chewing my ear off about how much he hates European cars.  I adjusted
the MPS clockwise, and then counter-clockwise... nothing!  He started
complaining that I was "screwing up his machine", and continued to tell
me what a piece of sh*t I've got.  I thanked him for his time
(miraculously keeping my composure), and drove home, stumbling the whole
way.  I tinkered with the MPS again, hoping to repeat the behavior from
the night before that had resulted in a perfect running engine.  No
luck.  My biggest question is:  At this point, if you were me, what
would you replace first?  The only thing that remains suspicious is the
MPS, the Computer, and the Injectors.  I'm thinking I should just get
four of the rebuild injectors from Automotion, and while I'm at it, pick
up one of their rebuilt MPSs.  That way, I can rule those two out, and
enjoy a little warranty time.  If that all fails, then I'll look into
getting another computer.  Sound reasonable?

Thanks again,
