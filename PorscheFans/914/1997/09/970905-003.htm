I think it's probably a good idea when buying parts from this forum or any
other advertising source, to state terms of sale prior to any transaction.  

Earlier this summer I purchased what were supposed to be 908 calipers from
Larry Moeller for $350, he also threw in a used set of Koni adjustable rears
from a '70 car.   When I got the calipers I immediately tried to contact
Larry by phone, to inform him that what he sent me were 911S calipers, which
I do not want.  No reply.  I also sent him an e-mail, no reply.  About three
weeks later I was finally able to speak to Larry on the phone, and his reply
was: "Sorry that money is already spent.  I was told that those were 908
calipers, so I can't do anything about it.  Those 911S calipers are selling
for that much anyway".  Subsequently I sent him e-mails informing him that I
would take legal action.  He sent me another e-mail and this time he had
decided that the 27 year old Konis he took off the car were now worth $100 of
the $350 that I gave him, and he would try and sell the calipers for me.
 What a bunch of bunk.  So I advise anyone buying parts to reserve the right
of refusal and return at the buyers expense.  Now I'm going to have to use up
some of my legal retainer to show Mr. Moeller that I don't intend to be
ripped off.  We aren't talking about a $25 part here,so........LET THE BUYER
BEWARE!!!!!
