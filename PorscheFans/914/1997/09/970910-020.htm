My 74 914 1.8 had been unused for 6 years.  I had a reliable car to
drive everyday and the tangerine 914, my first car, was shooting gas
geisers 6 feet in the air and mom's garage was empty (she was at work :) )

Rapidly approaching my third decade,  mom's pleas to have me remove that
"thing" from her garage hit a nerve of responsibility.  With 10 feet of
fuel line in one hand and a philips stubby in the other I replaced the
leaky lines.  All lines began to leak so I replaced those too.  Siphoned
off the 6 year old gas, filled with fresh and some redline SI-1
injector cleaner and it ran like new. 

Figured I'd pretest the car to see how favorable it stood with the mighty
CA emission lords before doing any tuneup work.  Didn't bother to even
change the oil or plugs.  After an Italian tuneup through some twisties I
took the car into the cheesy nearby smog shop that gives $10 pretests.  If
it passes they just go ahead and run the official smog.

Car passed!  HC's were less than a third of allowed.  CO was a little
above until I demanded that the air bypass screw on the mass airflow 
sensor be adjusted at idle (I has tinkered with that a bit when I was in
high school after all).  Car squeaked in the allowed CO.  Here's the
official results:

CO      idle   2500
P/F     5%     4%
actual  4.71%  3.94%

HC ppm  idle   2500
P/F     550    400
actual  147    123

Car passed smog today at 4pm and I squeaked into the AAA office just
before 5PM, got my new plates and registration tags.  A week ago this car
had a dead battery, flat tires, and was spraying fuel all over the engine
compartment (after swapping in a working battery to operate the fuel
pump).

Damn insurance is costing me a little less than $600 for a years coverage
(liability, collision, comprehensive).  I think I'll take the top off and
drive down to Big Sur tomorrow morning before I open up.  Gotta take in
the last sunny days of summer you know!
