Hi Jeff!

   You asked:

something like

  Should be OK.

> What about the bearings/bushings on the ends. Any particular lube I
could
> use or just leave alone?

  Depends on what they are... ball bearings, use a good grade of
grease... I prefer moly base... if bushings, these are most probably
oilite, which means that they are heat-soaked in oil, and have a felt
oil reservoir in their immediate proximity.   In this case, straight
engine oil is appropriate.

  C A U T I O N ! !    DO NOT get oil or grease on the comutator!  
If you do,use your contact cleaner to remove all of it before placing
the motor into service.  Be sure not to over-lubricate so that
lubricant migrates onto the commutator from the adjacent bearing
after the motor is placed in service.  Oil on a comutator quickly
turns into carbon, making a low-resistance connection between the
segments, which severely degrades motor performance and can ruin the
beast over time.

 I was

  Can't think of any... please let us know if you find out after the
fact that it wasn't such a good idea...

   Sounds like a good idea to me...

   I have never heard of this stuff... where can one obtain some?

  					Good Luck,
                                                            Jim T.
