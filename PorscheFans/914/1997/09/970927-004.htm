I've been reading Gary Wheeler's clutch replacement story and this has
prompted me to ask some questions.  I understand Gary did this without
removing the engine from the car.

1). Someone mentioned replacing the rear main seal.  I'm pretty sure mine's
leaking and would like to know the procedure for doing this.  How is the
old seal removed?  Is a special tool required to seat the new seal?  pp.
33, sect. 19, step 8 of Haynes refers to tool no. VW191 (photo) -- what
photo?  Photo 19.8 shows the seal but I don't see any tools.  Can this
sucker really be replace with the engine in the car?  Or at least without
cracking the case?

2). I'm confused about the proper torque setting for the bolts that attach
the CV joint to the transmission (and stub axle) flanges.  I thought Dirk
Wright wrote that torque spec. was 15 ft/lbs.  Page 92 of Haynes lists the
"Universal joint on flange" spec at 31 ft/lbs.  What is the correct
setting?

(Thanks, Dirk for reminding us to check the torque of the "central bolt in
the transmission output flange".  I didn't realize I should check it while
I had my half shafts out.  BTW Haynes lists the "Drive flange expansion
bolt" should be torqued at 25 to 29 ft/lbs.  I'll check next time).

TIA for your advice.
