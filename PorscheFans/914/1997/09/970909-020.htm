Gary: It worked!
The job took less than 1.5 hrs. Rate manual for the job is 4.2. Basically you
need to of course remove the wheel and caliper. (Haynes says you need to
bleed the brakes) we didn't do this, just pulled the caliper and suspended
the caliper from the engine by a piece of wire. Remove the rotor and hub and
the driveshafts (both). Insert the tool as per directions and the bearing
will come right out. Installation is the reverse (copyright Haynes Manual).
Make sure that everything is torqued correctly and you are there. As to a
rental fee, I have checked the internet and it appears that you should charge
a deposit equal to the cost of the item and  a rental fee on a per day basis.
I paid 102.98 for the tool and shipping. Therefore I need a similar deposit.
I think the rent should be $5.00 per day and you pay shipping both ways. If
this is acceptable please give me an e-mail with your address  so that I can
talk to UPS for a shipping fee. (opps. the rental starts on arrival, not the
date that I ships)
