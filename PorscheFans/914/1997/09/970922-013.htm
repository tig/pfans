Fellow 914ers: it's come time to replace the clutch on my '75 1.8. I'm
going to swap in a rebuilt tranny and hopefully rebuilt half shafts at
the same time. I'd like to drop just the tranny, which I've read is
doable, but Haynes only gives instructions to drop the whole power
train. Can anyone give me the play-by-play? My best guess:

1. Put car on jackstands.
2. Remove wheels (optional but will facilitate half-shaft replacement).
3. Remove muffler bracket and muffler.
3. Undo half-shafts at tranny and wire out of way.
4. Remove speedo cable
5. Remove shift linkage and bar to junction at engine mount.
6. Remove ground strap.
7. Remove starter.
8. Support engine with hydraulic jack.
9. Support tranny with tranny jack.
10. Remove rear tranny mounts (2 nuts either side)
11. Remove tranny-to-engine bolts (4 total)
12. Move tranny backwards until clear and lower.
13. Clutch as per Haynes.
14. Assembly is the reverse of above (Gotta love that Haynes optimism).

Did I forget anything critical? Are there any hidden "gotchas"?

On a related note, I got a set of rebuilt half-shafts from Automotion
during their recent sale, but they came without stub axles. Anything
special about getting the stub axles off my half-shafts? I don't
remember off-hand how they're attached.

TIA, Gary (gwheeler@tomco.net)
