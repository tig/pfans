I think it's feasable, but you have some construction to do. You'll need a
strong and secure stand for the engine and transaxle, and a way to get the
exhaust outdoors, obviously. You should grab the fuel pump and battery, too
of course. You'll need to know which wires in the FI are +12V and which are
ground, plus a starter switch (normally open, momentary). The fuel tank you
use will need supply and return lines. This could get very dangerous unless
you are very careful!

To do the rebuilds, you'll need several special tools and a decent workspace.
