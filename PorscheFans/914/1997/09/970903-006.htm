When I was buying my first 914 I received some great advice from Perry
Kiehl, who suggested that the first thing that I do is to examine the
area under the outer rockers for rust. This is definitely a make or
break area on a 914 for rust, (along with the battery tray/suspension
console). The lower edge of the rocker is secured with two or three hex
head sheet metal screws, (or the erusted in remains of same). If you can
unscrew them, you probably have nothing to worry about anyway, but if
you can't, chisel, drill, or blast them off. This will allow you to
swing the lower edge of the outer rocker out far enough for an
examination of the inner rocker (aka clamshell or longitudinal).
Visually inspect, and poke at it with a screw driver or an awl to
ascertain the extent (notice I didn't say presence) of rust in this
area. Repair and or strengthening of this area is an absolute must for a
car that is to be tracked, as it is a major contributor to chassis
stiffness. The next area to check is the inner side, in the passenger
compartment, by removing the floor trim and pulling back the carpet.
To actually remove the outer rocker, you will need to remove the lower
door sill trim and the rocker mounting rivets by drilling. Finally are
two screws at the top ends of the rockers that come straight down
through the front and rear fender bottom edges, through a black rubber
or hard plastic spacer into the top ends of the rocker
panels.                                       Good Luck,  Jim S.
