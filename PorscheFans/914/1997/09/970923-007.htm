	Mike has given permission for me to forward this to the list.
He sent it to me in response to my query about steering wheel bushings.
I thought it might be of interest to some of us.
	Two people gave me the part number for a 928 bushing that works
on early 911s, but Mike's note seems to indicate that it won't work on
a 914.  Too bad.  8^(
