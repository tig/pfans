Removing rocker arms is the easy part. Getting the pushrod tubes out without
banging up your hands or damaging the tubes is tough. You do the job one
cylinder at a time. Turn the engine over by hand until the rockers are
loose, then simply unbolt them, and they come right off. Clean them good
while you have them off, including the rocker bearings. Polish those up good
and put some assembly lube on them before re-installing them. Check the
bottom of the rocker shaft for scuff marks. If yours are scuffed on the
bottom but not the top, you can flip the shaft so that the good side bears
the load (facing the head). Also, run your finger nail across the bearing
area on the shaft to the non-bearing area. If there is any lip, the shaft is
worn out, and the rocker probably is too.

BTW, I'm working on a needle bearing rocker arm arrangement for our engines.
Stay tuned.
