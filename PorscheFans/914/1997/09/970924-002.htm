I am jumping in blindly, (as is usual) in the removal and reinstallation
of the push rod tubes and seals.  Car had sat for a long time and
needless to say almost everything that seals or is rubber/plastic is in
need of replacing.

This looks like a rather straight forward operation with the worst part
being the removal of the rocker arm assembly.  However as we have all
found out over the years nothing ever seems to go the way we invision
it.

Any and all advise appreciated.

Q's

1.  Do the valve adjustment screws need to be loosened up all the way as
in some cars to prevent bending of components?

2.  Any sealer needed on the tube seals for a better seal/fit?

3. Horrors to watch out for on removal/replacement of the rocker arm
assembly? (Honda cvcc"s had a scad of gotchas).

4.  Is this one of those jobs that turns out to be a real PITA and I
should just take the easy way out and spend a buck and a quarter for a
wrench, and miss out on the fun of grease, dirt and creative swearing?

TIA
