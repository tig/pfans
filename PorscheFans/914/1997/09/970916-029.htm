RWB,

Now why would you want to eliminate that smell?
That's a sign of a true Porsche.
Seriosly, it may help to
clean the oil off your heat exchangers and heater boxes.
You can do this when you remove them to replace the leaking push
rod tube seals. If your exchangers are corroded, there may also
be oil inside them but you can't reach that and you should consider
replacing them (cha-ching).

These jobs aren't difficult if you're willing to crawl under the car
and get dirty, although the push rod tube seals will require a valve
adjustment. Use viton seals, new gaskets and don't overtighten the
valve train components.

Oh, and don't doubt yourself when your significant other
or friends walk past shaking their heads.
