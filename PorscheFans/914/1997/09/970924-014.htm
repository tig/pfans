It is a problem, with the hose fittings and the barbs.  One solution
double clamp them.  A better mouse trap is to use a clamp retention
device.  I found some in a hardware store in town, but also see TIP
carries them now.  Idea is the hose clamp also clamps done a piece of
metal that attaches around the fitting, in this situations I would design
my own.  All it has to do is grab the clamp, to keep it from blowing out.
 Look for them in a well stocked pneumatics store.

Most bug shops sell the stuff, also hydraulics suppliers sell it for
cheap, and you can have fittings crimped on.

Yes

Use the brass, the nylon I think is rated a 250psi @ 80 F, that is the
standard for CPVC, it degrades fast after that.  I know your are weight
conscious, but it is worth the extra 2 pounds, anyway your EFI setup
should mean you have an extra 10% to add back into the car.  Or 180lbs, I
guess a cage could do that while stiffing the chassis even more.

Yes, and on Iron use atleast 2x as normal.  Brass does fine with the
normal wrap.

Are you mounting the cooler out back?  If so yes that would work , if up
front I tucked mine up into the rear wheel well area before it heads down
the rocker (by the jack post.  Un-used space, just have to wash off now
and again, but I have a front mounted cooler.

Good luck with that 2.5L (har, har, mattie! I did not know you speacked
fluent pirarate.)

Take care,
