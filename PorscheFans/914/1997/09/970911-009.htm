Hi, I used to have a 2.0L that the P.O. had drilled out the hubs/rotors
and pressed in normal 911 lugs in place of the bolts.  They worked fine
and it was SO MUCH EASIER TO CHANGE TIRES! It was an Auto-X 
car and it was much faster to change at the track/lot whatever.

I know it isn't original, but I don't know why more people don't do this??

Is there something bad about this that I am missing?

Thx,
