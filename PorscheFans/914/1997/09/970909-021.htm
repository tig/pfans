     Hi,
     
        I only caught the end of this rift on the bumpers...but hey, they 
     work!  I pulled into the fast lane 6 weeks ago at the flow of traffic. 
     The Chevy S10 ahead of me abrubtly stopped, and so did I (I was two 
     feet away from their rear bumper with both of us stopped).  
     Unfortunately, the Mazda 626 behind me didn't stop fast enough, and 
     shoved me forward into the S10.  The Mazda's bumper me mine just fine 
     (I have a '76 2.0 w/ 5 (+)MPH bumpers), but I slid UNDER the Chevy's 
     ahead of me.  No body hurt, my poor Sunflower Yellow's front hood 
     however has a license-plate-wide swath of paint totally scrapped away 
     to the primer for 6 inches back from the front lip of the hood. My 
     front turnsignal lens broke, and one of the rear license plate light 
     housings broke.  I was hit at a speed I judged to be faster than 5 
     MPH, but have no way of knowing how much more.
     
        For a street car, I think these bumpers are definitely an asset 
     over the 70-74 series and I know I would have had major structural 
     damage without them.  Yes they weigh more, and that's important when 
     you only have 82 wheezing HP to move you around, or want low polar 
     moment of inertia for AutoCrossing, but I think VW did a great job in 
     (over)engineering these bumpers.
     
        Well, we all settled it, I am looking for a good Bay Area/Peninsula 
     shop to repaint me headlight covers and hood and fix/replace my 
     scraped up bumper cover in front.  I 'm covered by the insurance from 
     the car behind me. 
         Ironically, the S10 I was pushed into was driven by that rarest of 
     all, an HONEST Attorney.  She confirmed that she only felt 1 impact, 
     and only heard one set of squealing brakes (actually, that's not fair, 
     my 914 could not lock up its terminally mushy brakes if you welded the 
     rotors to the calipers)
     
     
        Thanks VW for those big lumpy bumpers.
