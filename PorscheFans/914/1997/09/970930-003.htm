<< I need to get a racing seat for my track/autox  914. After a recent PCA 
 event it is very evident that I need a real racing seat in the 914. Does 
 anyone have any experience with this and/or  have a recommendation for the 
 way to go on this.
 
 Thanks...

Hi John, one basic question needs to be answered first, how attached to
the rear back panel upholstery pad are you??  If you want to keep that in
place you are limited.  Koenig makes a nice 914 seat that fits on the
factory seat rails.  It is available from a number of sources including Auto
motion etc.  It is very nice but does not have holes for a safety harness.

I have removed most of my upholstery, and this opens up your options
greatly, especially if you are willing to make up your own seat brackets.
I used a pair of OMP race buckets, they have a fairly vertical back and
fit perfectly in the 914.  I had to fabricate a bracket to mount them onto
the factory seat rails but it worked easily.  You could choose Sparco,
OMP, Corbeau, Cobra etc if you are willing to change your interior around
a little.  

Thx,
