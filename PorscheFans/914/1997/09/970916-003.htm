I made a small booboo here. The life expectancy for the above racing
conditions were for stock engines. The expectancy based on the sustained
engine speed is for thier precision remanufactured engines.

Yeah, they are able to run 10:1 compression ratio on street gas because of
the many modifications they make, including some patented technology. The
highest they recommend for "regular" unmodified engines is 9:1 these days.

But, it's not the CR that is the major factor in determining engine life,
it's engine operating speed. Sure, CR is a contributing factor, but the main
thing is that the speed that you run your engine at will certainly effect
it's life. Of course, I'm sure everyine knew this. I just wanted to lay out
some numbers for eveyone's horror. I would guess that the life expectancy
for the VW air cooled motor would be worse becuase of the higher operating
temperatures, but I have no data to prove this.
