The stock coil is so pathetic that I don't understand why anyone would want
to keep it. I trashed mine a long time ago. Good regular coils can be had
for less than 30$ (but you'll need a ballast resistor for a couple of bucks). 

Coils are high voltage step up transformers with both negative leads tied to
the - terminal. The primary is connected between the + and - terminals, and
the secondary is between the - and high voltage output terminals. When
comparing coils, the lower the resistance of these windings, the more power
that will delivered to the plugs, given the same rated output voltage. To
increase the output voltage, the number of turns on the secondary is
increased, but the tradeoff is that more turns makes for higher resistance,
so the wire size has to be increased to maintain a low resistance. This
makes the coil more expensive. The primary resistance is also important,
since too low of a resistance will fry the points (or the points replacement
device). A good coil rated for 35,000volt output will have a primary
resistamce of about 2.5 ohms, and a secondary resisance of abouut 7,000
ohms. Go ahead, take your dmm into the auto parts store and measure the coil
resistances. Attach the - lead to the - terminal, set it to read resistance,
and put the + lead on the + terminal to get the primary resistance, and on
the HV output (coil wire) terminal to get the secondary resistance. There
are differences between coils and I can tell the difference with different
coils in the car. With a good low resistance coil the engine will idle
smoother, start easier, and rev better.
