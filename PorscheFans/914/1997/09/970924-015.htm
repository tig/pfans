O.K., I ran my 914 over to my trusted mechanic (NOT the one that hates
Porsches - boy, what a mistake!) now that I've got the new MPS
installed.  At idle, the CO fluctuates between 1.5 and 3.0, and the
hydrocarbons fluctuate between 800 and 1700 ppm.  Obviously, I'm not
going to pass emissions.  When the engine is held at a constant 3000
rpm, the mixtures holds at a steady 2.5, and the hydrocarbons drop to a
constant 200 ppm.  The mechanic explained that either too much fuel or
too little fuel can cause high hydrocarbons.  He suggested the injectors
may be the problem.  Since the plug wires and plugs are new, it kinda'
rules that out.  So, on my way home I got to thinking about yesterday's
discussion on coils, and took a look at mine.  It doesn't look so hot,
so I've ordered a new Bosch Blue to replace it.  Anyone think this will
work?  The theory is that at lower RPM, the coil isn't making enough
"spark" to fully ignite the air/fuel mixture, but at higher RPMs, it
does.  If this fails, I'll dig into injector replacement.  The best
price I've found so far is from GPR ($66/each - brand new).  Is there a
better alternative?  Anyone try Automotion's rebuilds?

Thanks again!
