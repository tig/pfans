What you propose works even better if you convert the engine lid to a GT style 
with extra open spaces next to the rear window.  That way, the cooler gets its 
own "outlet" without blocking any existing ones.

I know there was a thread regarding oil cooler placement within the last year, 

but I can't seem to find it.  
I saw a suggestion somewhere that a potential position for an oil cooler  
would 
be to remove the drip pan from the engine grill and mount the oil cooler in 
its 
place.  With a small cooler I would think there would be better air flow into 
the engine compartment than with the drip pan in place.  Any thoughts?

Thanks,
