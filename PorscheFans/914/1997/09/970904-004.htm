     Hi Mike Gensler and 914-List,
     
        You reply to an inquiry about how to install a "sidewinder" 
     Cadillar Northstar V-8 into a 914 by saying: " use a hammer....".
     Well, I don't believe that reply provided any assistance to the person 
     making the original inquiry.  I'd like to reply to that inquiry by 
     supplying the list with some USEFUL information.
     
        First of all, VW has already done this type of "conversion" in high 
     production runs.  The Fox used the Rabbit/Polo engine but in a fore 
     and aft installation ala AUDI.  The Vanagon in the early 80's used the 
     Rabbit diesel attached to the Type IV transaxle with a simple Bell 
     housing adapter. (Get your hands on this bellhousing, and one can 
     place a 4-valve 2.0 VW GTI engine into the 914 engine bay, preserving 
     the "VW" part of the VW/Porsche identity).
     
     
        Kennedy Engineering in Southern California has mastered the art of 
     interfacing most ANY engine with the VW Transaxle family for use in 
     BAHA racing.  Since all Porsche Transaxles for the 911 & 914 are part 
     of this "family", the adapters Kennedy has can be made to do the job. 
     
     BTW [for the purposes of THIS discussion, I'm making the stretch that 
     VW's and Porsches are indeed related] 
     
     A very popular engine to run at BAHA is the Toyota series.  These are 
     traditional fore-and-aft engines so no sweat.  However, Kennedy has 
     also done an adapter for the Ford Taurus SHO 24 Valve/Yamaha engine to 
     the VW transaxle.  This is a so called "side-winder" (the term is 
     transverse) engine.  
     
        What may not be apparent to the casual observer is that transverse 
     engines are indeed tightly packaged with their transaxles (some even 
     share lubricating oil), however, they are not UNIT built (SEE ANY 
     JAPANESE MOTORCYCLE) i.e. the engine and transaxle remain seperate 
     assemblies.
     
        The long and short of this is Yes the Cadillac Northstar can be 
     interfaced to the 901 transaxle, and probably in a very clean 
     installation.  The flaws of the 901 remain however, with 1st gear 
     cantilevered and the mainshaft subject to flexing under high torque 
     loads, allowing the teeth of the gear to misalign and snap!  A better 
     place to put that engine however would probably be in a Pontiac Fiero, 
     since it was designed for the transverse setup with engine on top of 
     its own transaxle.  
     
     
     Any how thanks for the soapbox, I hope this helps.
