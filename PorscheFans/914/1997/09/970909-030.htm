Hello again,

Well it is time for one of my weird 914 stories, I cna't sleep, can't
spell either, so I am now rambling.  After being on this list for so long
I have kind of created a mental note about the world of 914 ownership.

Most 914 tails follow the same route and seem to have close to the same
destiny.

It all starts on a dark night, you can't sleep, you toss and turn but to
no avail sleep escapes you for another night.  So you start to think
about things, and being a car junky it is usually about cars, well at
least every 6 seconds or so.  You remember riding in a vehicle that
handled like a go-kart, but was bigger. For some reason you can't shake
that little car out of your head, you hop in what ever mundane car you
currently drive and head for the local quicky - mart.  Grab the local
Auto-Sale-trad'in paper and toss the dollar at the person behind the
counter.  Who for all chances figures you are going to rob him, after all
they have 3 bullet scares to prove it happens.  For a brief moment you
stop and look at the meat products that come in a bag or the rotisserie
hot dog form 1952 that is still up there cleaming away under the warming
lights.  That nice red glow makes you think that the hot dog is edible. 
But as the auto-matic door closes, knocking you upside the head, you
relieve that thing is probably older than you.  And the government should
probably study it for alien life.

Back at home now on your 10th cup of joe, well you can't go to sleep now!
 Your are reading thru every add, sifting your way thru all the Plymouths
and Pontiacs, not to mention the PHords, those darn typos.  Then like a
grail from a heavenly celestial body, you spot it.  Really it is your SO
staring thru your head and into your soul.  But there it is a 7? 914 no
rust excellent car with 105,000 miles for $5000.  Hey, the seller has
their dreams also.

Once it becomes a sane hour you call, well at this point sane is 5:59est,
and well you forgot (508) was in the Pacific time zone.  Waking the
sellers interior house a 3:00 PAC time did not do you one bit of good. 
But you did get a new group of superlatives to work into your vocabulary.
 Your next call is we fly cheap, discount airline tickets.  You grab the
first crop duster headed west for the coast and finally fall a sleep.

Once landing in the west you grab the last car from rent-a-wreck and head
to the sellers house.  You get there and you do find a 914 well sort of. 
 Just like the Artist formally know as Prince this thing should not be
called a 914, it defiantly has a new different name.  Usually spelled out
across the engine lid, ORSH, which in German means about what this car
is.  But it is the only 914 you have seen in your hole 1 day of searching
so you buy it.

Believe it or not it does run, so You head out on the high road.  You are
driving along when the first true sign of 914 ownership shows up.  That
little green light starts to flicker then it goes solid.  You shut her
off and coast to a stop.  Looking back down the road you see what is left
of your 4 qts of oil.  So now you get towed home.

Once there you find out the next bit of Porsche maintenance.  Sure you
can do that with the engine in the car, but it takes the hands of a 2
year old and dexterity brain surgeon, with the ability to contort like
some carnival star.  So after your first time you revise the Hayse manual
to say STEP1 drop the engine.  STEP 2 Continue on with the rest of the
procedures.

Here is where most 914 owners make a fatal mistake, we get
WHILEUAREATITitus.  It is a dreaded disease, and worst there is no know
cure.  You proceed to take the entire 914 apart just so you can make sure
everything is put back in there correctly.  Now to quote H.Ross Parot "
You hear a big sucking sound from the south."  No it is not all the jobs
we lose because of NAFTA, it is all the money getting sucked out of your
wallet.

After about 1 to 20 years you finally complete the rustoration.  You have
lost more sleep than new parents do, and more money.  You now know the
entire 914 buy braille, and know in your heart of hearts this thing is
going to be the cats meow.

After several fun days, if you are lucky months, it starts to develop
some anomalies.  Your gas gauge unbeknownst to you stops working, well
914s get good gas mileage so as your odo approaches 420 miles the engine
dies.  You are now stranded on one of the busiest interstates in the US. 
Only thing that saves you is a fellow Porsche (Outcast car) Owner in a
black 928 picks you up after walking a mile.  And drops you at the
nearest gas station, who sells you a gas can, a $6 Us for a 1 gallon can,
and then proceeds to charge a $1.99 for 87 octane because it is holiday
weekend.  Now walking back to the 914 5 miles back you get blasted by
somebody in a 911, only to relieve that it was somebody you knew and they
will not stop for you.  Also latter that day you get a call for a
co-worker asking you if you ran outa gas in your Porch today.  They also
don't stop.

And the saga continues, you spend countless hours tracking down this or
that, to have some brief to long moments of bliss.  But after all those
moments of bliss make up for all the hard ship that little car has put
you thru.

Now that I passed emissions today after finding a bad fuel pressure
regulator I think 45 PSI would make he car run a little rich, book calls
for 30-35 PSI, maybe I can enjoy a few moments of 914 zen.  Well it is
about the right time to go out and blast a few country roads, in my Elvis
outfit.  It is so much fun to make people think the KING is still alive. 
Especially since most of the people around here think this PORCH is some
sort of UFO.  See I told Cleanis, Elvis was abducted by them aliens. 
Okay, Okay, I just had to see it with my own one eye,
Billy-Jim-Joe-Booo-booo-bob-Brain.  But then you look like a mouse with
an evil plan to take over the world.  Narff! 

Take care,
