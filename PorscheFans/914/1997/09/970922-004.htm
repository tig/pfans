After some difficulty getting my 74 914 started I decided to check the fuses 
on the relay board.  The fuses were fine but I discovered that there was 
only a single relay on the board ( the heater fan relay ).  All the other 
sockets were empty.  Now my car is a 74 with a 2.0 engine but it has rthe 
D-Jet FI susystem from a 1.8.  I'd like to know if this should be the case 
for a D-Jet system or do I need to get a few relays to populate the board.  
The car had started and ran fine untill this week end.  It seems a little 
odd to me that some key relays have been missing but the car still ran like 
a champ.  Any clues would be apreciated.
