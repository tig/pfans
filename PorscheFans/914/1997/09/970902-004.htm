Over the weekend I changed the fuel filter, replaced the plugs, put on
new spark plug wires, installed my new K&N, adjusted the valves, changed
the oil, in cleaned up the FI trigger points with an emory (sp?) board.
The points looked good to me, but I'm no expert, so I gave them a once
over with the emory board.  After all of this, the car seems a little
better, but not perfect.  I've driven it around the neighborhood several
times now, and I'm getting a better feel for the problem.  While
accelerating (even slowly), it's perfect.  While decelerating (again,
even slowly), it's perfect.  It starts perfectly, as well.  There was a
little smoke after I changed the oil, but it went away after idling for
about 2 minutes.  What I notice is what feels like major engine misses
(good-sized "bucking") when maintaining a constant RPM, load or no load.
Now, if I remember correctly, this is a tell-tale symptom of a bad
TPS... the only problem is that my mechanic just put a brand-new on in!
Should I still be suspicious of the trigger points (they weren't even
dusty, much less corroded)?  Is it time to swap in a new ECU?  When I
replaced the plugs, they were very black.  Could it just be a matter of
idle fuel mixture?  One more thing... the only thing I haven't done yet
(and should be shot for) is checking my grounds.  How, exactly, does one
"check grounds"?  If I determine that they need cleaning, will a wire
brush and some "brake-clean" do the job?  Other than the tranny ground
strap and the top-passenger-side of the bell housing, are there other
ground points that should be checked?

Thanks again for everyone's help...  I just might get to drive the car
before it gets buried in snow!
