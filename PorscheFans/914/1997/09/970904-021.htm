Ok, Here's a good one.

	Ever since I switched oils (in an attempt to control engine temps) I've
been experiencing oil leaks of one form or another. Primarilly it's been
VC gaskets due to impropper installation (Duh). Well I fixed all that.
And most recently I've been thinking that I have a pushrod seal leak.
I've been getting smoking pipes from the left side everytime I park the
car after a long drive. However, in showing my uncle the car (he really
wanted to see _everything_) I discovered what looked like water in my
air intake hose. 

....Just so you know, I modified my air intake so it draws straight down
from the engine lid into the left side of the air box, and the right
side intake was removed and capped off...

Well, I figured I hadn't covered the intake properly when I parked it
and got some rainwater in the airbox. No biggie I figured, so I popped
of the air box cover and pulled the filter (gotta change it, it's
lookin' a little dirty) and dicovered OIL! What the @#$%! How does oil
get in there? I havn't a clue. The filter is dry, the throttle body is
dry, the breather hoses are routed to a 1 Qt. catch tank. So what's the
deal? I _KNOW_ I didn't inadvertently use my new intake as an oil
filler, so what the hell happened? I wonder if this could be where oil
is coming from and spilling out a crack and then leaking down to my
pipes? The only time the car has been out of my sight is at Solo Week
where it was in the paddock for a week when it wasn't in competition.

All I can figure is that some @#$%head poured oil in there when I wasn't
around while it was parked in the paddock area. I would _really_ hate to
believe that was the case. I always thought racers were a trustworthy
and reliable lot. It's not like my car is a class beater anyway.

Geeez...
