I told Glenn I would be interested.

I don't know about copyright issues enough to comment on doing a whole
manual but portions?  I just bought the color wiring diagram that Auto
Atlanta sells separately, I though this was a copy of the factory manual
diagram but I could be misinformed.

By the way these color versions really help.  I've been chasing electrical
gremlins using the diagrams out of Haynes.  The Haynes, I've been told,
were black and white copies of the official manuals, with wire color labels
put over them.  In at least one case the labels block areas where there may
or may not be connections when wires cross.  The color ones have helped
clear these up for me.

Before I got the color ones I used a copy machine to make 11x17 enlarged
copies of the Haynes and that helped somewhat.  Easier to track wires
without jumping to the wrong wire.  Plus I made several copies so I can get
them grease/dirty rather than the manual.  Considering doing this with the
color ones.

I know the dealer refuses to make copies of any portion of the manual,
citing copyright protection. But, I think that as long as you don't have an
intent to duplicate the manual and pretend to sell it as a genuine porsche
manual, and you don't reproduce the entire thing, you might be ok. But,
what does the copyright notice say in the front of the manual? You might be
ok if you reproduce only small portions of the manual. If you really want
to be safe, consult a lawyer. Porsche also may have let the copyright
expire, but I don't know how you can check up on that.
