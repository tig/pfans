Thanks to all who rendered advice on the clutch job a few days back. It
took about three days at 4-6 hours/day - not very efficient, but it was
my first time and I guess I wasn't in a particular hurry. I spent the
first day getting stuff apart, the second getting about 1/3 through
reassembly before realizing I needed more parts (see below), the third
buttoning things up. For those who haven't been through the process, my
list ended up being fairly complete, save missing the back-up light
leads and the clutch cable. It works well to just jack up either side
with the jack plate and rest the car on the rear posts just in front of
the rear wheels. I used several people's advice to lower the tranny
enough to clear the rear, then resting the engine on a jack-stand before
separating it from the tranny.

Two "gotchas" I ran accross: 1. The replacement half shafts from
Automotion come with the two CV joint roll pins on one side only. For
the life of me, I couldn't get my old ones out to reuse. They're a
pretty tight press fit. Of course no one local sourced them. I ended up
calling Stoddard's and getting some Fed-Ex'd out and thankfully they
arrived about 930 the next morning. 2. The nut holding the left upper
tranny-to-engine is on the engine side and a real bear to thread back
on. I ended up dropping the engine enough to get at it from the side
under the wheel well. This popped off the boot on the air-flow meter and
she wouldn't start last night. Talk about disheartening! It a little bit
to figure it out this morning. I guess an alternative to threading the
nut back on would be to take off the air-flow meter and associated
hardware in the engine compartment that block access.

It's really great not to crunch 3rd to 2nd anymore. FYI, I got my
rebuilt tranny from Brad Mayeur. It shifts very smoothly, if still a bit
tightly - to be expected on its first day out! He's really a great guy
to deal with on the phone and I think his work is exceptionally
reasonably priced: $500 for the rebuild including thorough inspection
and all new synchros, $150 for core charge (my 914 is a daily driver and
I couldn't afford the turn-around time), and $50 for shipping from
Illinois to Marland. That works out to $700 for a delivered rebuilt
tranny. Brad's a retired Porsche mechanic (and 914 nut), so I'm
confident of his expertise, and he offers a 6 month warranty. He
advertises on the Renegade 914 page.

Incidentally, Performance Products sends an early 911S disk as a 914
replacement. Stoddard's lists the same part number also. It seems to
work fine with the 914 pressure plate despite warnings in AutoAtlanta's
tech tips that it is too thin. I did need to adjust the tranny end of
the clutch cable all the way tight.

Does anyone else feel that the tranny mount to body fasteners are
under-engineered? It's just 4 8mm bolts holding the rear end of the
drive train. Granted, it's the lighter end, but it seems a bit flimsy to
me. I'm inclined to ream out the holes and go to a 10mm bolt as an
interim measure; ideally it would be nice to beef up the back end with a
partial frame to include the transmission mounts.

Thanks again to all. Your advice really helped.
