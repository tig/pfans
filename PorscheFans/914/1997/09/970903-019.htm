In PCA you will be running in I-1 along with every other 914 with carbs
or Programmable EFI.  How do we do well......, most carb people can not
keep up with P4 in times.  My plan is to make the class a little more
logical step in times between it and M classes.  How does the 914 do in
auto-x, well very well.  In PCA P4 will ussally hold FTD until modified
classes run, and in them Modified 914 will take FTD, I would bet 9.999
out of 10.  But this is at national level, Porsche Parade competition. 
At your local level the bais will be different.  We have a bunch of stock
914 running in this area, but no Modified 914s. So we get are clocks
cleaned by M3 911s churning out some wicked HP numbers, or 944Turbo Cup
cars with a mad man behind the wheel. (That statement said with great
respect for it's driver, who knows how to drive and win.  But does it
against every rule in the book.  How many people you know take FTD while
going sideways thru the timing light, on purpose.  But he is only 4-5
seconds ahead of us even thou we run a drag strip course that is really
open.  Mainly a 3rd gear 914 course, and the 944TC had about 3x the HP. 
See going sideways does eat time.

Enjoy it, once mastered it will be as fast if not faster than your 911 in
most auto-x situations.

As for the R1s there are many substitutes, all dempends on your driving
style.  I am on a low budget so I am not picky what I get from fellow
list members they run R1s so I will be running used R-1s.  If they switch
to Kumhos, well then at some time so will I.  Beagers can not be
choosers.  

But I will say for me R-1s are night and day different than my Dunlop
D40M2s, a nice tire but for the auto-x R-1s are much better.  Also if
running in C-Street Prepared, D-Prepared and with wide wheels and fender
flares, I would run slicks if you can afford them, also can be picked up
used.  Slicks are one of the best GIFTS SCCA gave to Street Prepared,
over the stock classes.  But your car WILL handle completely different on
SLICKS than it does on even R-1s again night and day difference.

Take care,
