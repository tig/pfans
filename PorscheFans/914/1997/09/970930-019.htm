    Christian:

    The most desirable car in this price range is a Guards Red 1973
    914-6 conversion with a 2.7-liter Euro Carrera RS motor and a
    Chalon body kit.

    I just happen to have one for sale...

    Seriously, though, $15K will buy any 914-4 on the planet, most
    good 914-6s, a 911SC in excellent condition, or a good 911
    Carrera.  If it were me and reliability were my primary concern,
    I'd probably buy an '83 911SC or an '84-'89 Carrera.

    If you don't mind owning a front-engined Porsche, your $15K
    could get you a decent 944 Turbo (aka 951)... I'd stay away from
    all the other front-engine Porsches; they're either VERY
    expensive to maintain (928) or underpowered (924 and
    normally-aspirated 944/968).

    Aside from obvious ones like rust, no.  There ARE, however,
    certain common problems that your MECHANIC should look for.

    DO NOT buy a Porsche without first having had it inspected by a
    competent Porsche mechanic... A thorough pre-purchase inspection
    will cost around $50-100 and it'll be the best money you ever
    spend on your car.
