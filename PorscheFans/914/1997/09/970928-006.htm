Red Line 75W90NS will work with a limited slip (clutch type) unit. The
reason Red Line doesn't steer you in that direction is that use of this oil
may produce some Limited Slip "Chatter". The "Chatter" is caused by the
clutch type limited slip grabbing. Many racers will put up with the noise to
get better limited slip action. The friction modifier, whether the GM
additive or the Red Line 75W90 that also contains a friciton modifier, makes
the gear oil more slippery and therefore eliminates the grabbing the casuses
the "chatter". With transaxles we really have a tough job for a gear oils.
For best synchro engagement we want something not too slippery. The
differential wants something real slippery. Sooooo.....for your car I think
you purchased the right thing in the 75W90NS...good synchro engagement, and
since you don't have a limited slip, you won't have to worry about "chatter".
