OK, there are a couple of different types of limited slip differentials.
Broadly, one type has friction discs in them, and another does not. The
Quaife does not have friction discs in it. It is a spur gear differential
that relies on the rubbing of the pinion gears against the case for
limiting differentiation. You most likely could use this oil with a Quaife,
though  Quaife may recommend otherwise. Another type of limited slip in
this catagory is the Torsen, which has worm gears in it.
