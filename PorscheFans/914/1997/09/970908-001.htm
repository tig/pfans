Boy, if it's not one thing, it's another.  I finished cleaning up all of
the grounds and replacing cruddy connectors.  I also pulled the
distributor and measured the resistance of the points (infinite to zero,
each bank 180 degrees apart).  Everything looked O.K., and apparently
something did the trick.  I took the car for a spin and it was
absolutely perfect!  Brought tears to my eyes... literally.  It's also a
good 5 MPH faster on my "test hill", and that's only shifting at 4000
rpm!  Before the pure joy overwhelmed me, the car warmed up, and started
to miss.  The warmer it got, the more it missed.  I called one of the
local emissions places to see if I couldn't come in and adjust my
mixture.  They said no, but they said they could test it, give me the
results, and if it fails, come back for a free re-test.  So, off I went
to the emissions place, and once again, the warmer it got, the more it
missed.  Not only does it miss, but the idle drops a good 600 rpm (1100
when cold, 500 when warm).  Sure enough, I was running WAY rich all
around.  5.8% CO at idle, 4.8% at 2500 rpm - HCs off the scale!  I took
the car home, checked the plugs (black), and gave the MPS a full turn
clockwise (lean).  I drove it for a while, and noticed a small
improvement; it feels like it wants to "clear its throat" - the more I
stand on the gas, the less stumbling, however, as soon as I slow down to
turn around, it'll stumble again, and I need to drive it under
continuous load to stop the missing.  Once I got home, I checked the
plugs again, and now they're bordering between white and tan.  I would
love to chalk all of this up as a bad mixture problem, but I have a
feeling it's something else.  Has anyone else run into anything like
this before?

Thanks again (and again and again)!
