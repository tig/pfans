A very good suggestion, as water in the MPS could lead to excessive
corrosion and premature failure.

10 in. hg is pretty small, but not a bad number to use for testing
purposes.

Bzzzt. I'd tend dissagree with that. Lift off the throttle at 5000 rpm,
I'm pretty sure you're generating ALOT more vacuum than at idle. That's
why when you have worn valve guides (like mine) you suck oil down the
valve stem and blow blue smoke when you lift at high rpms. Although it
is a sign of a tired engine (and don't I know it!) it is an amusingly
helpfull indicator at an autox. You can have someone watch you and
comment on your driving without ever sitting in the car. They can SEE
when you lift. Poooff. You can also see when a car shifts, or doesn't
shift (shift dave, shift dave! SHIFT DAVE!!). ;)

Don't discount how much fatigue 20 years of oscillating vacuum behind a
thin metal membranne can create. I'd say you merely accelerated it's
imminent demise, but more than likely it was going to die soon anyway.

Doesn't taste too good though.  Blech...
