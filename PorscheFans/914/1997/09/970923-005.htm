Brakes are the easiest job you can do on a Porsche!

I do mine in about 30 mins on the 944, and 20 on the 914. On the track
car we do it between sessions, which are 20 mins and they are REAL HOT
when you do it so it takes longer.

Steps are:

1.	Break the lug nuts while the wheels are on the ground
2.	Open the Brake fluid resivior and remove ½ of the fluid
3.	Starting with passenger side Jack just off the ground (Say wheel
2" off ground)
4.	Install a jack stand to hold car (CYA)
5.	Remove lugs and place wheel under car for safety
6.	Using pin driver or nail set pop out the two pins the pads ride
on (Catch the cross spring as it falls)
7.	With a large screwdriver press the pads back by canting the rod
between the tops of the pads. The trick is to push the pistons back
without putting the blade on the piston, I do it by putting the blade
between the old pad and the rotor.
8.	Disconnect the pad sensor using a small screwdriver and retain.
9.	Pop out pad
10.	Insert the sensor into the new pad and insert pads
11.	Repeat as needed
 
	The normal wear is 3 sets of fronts for each back set

	After changing all the pads that need to be done (Always do in
pairs, fronts, rears, or both) using your foot pump the brake petal
until the pads seat (It will start out like you have no brakes then get
hard).

1.	Now back to brake fluid (Using a turkey baster remove as much of
the old fluid you can)
2.	Refill the fluid with a real good DOT-4 fluid, I use ATE Supper
Blue.
3.	Now flush the brake lines by opening the bleeder on each caliper
one at a time and drain into a jar by putting a length od clear tubing
over bleeder.  Start with rear passenger then rear driver, then front
passenger and so on. Let the fluid run until it looks clear or if you
are going to Blue, then blue. (What you are doing is purging the old WET
fluid and getting all the air out). Some people use vacuum or pressure
bleeders but nature works well.
4.	As you finish with each caliper check the fluid level and
cleanup any dirt, grease, or fluid on caliper or rotor with brakeclean.
5.	Check the pedal again to make sure it is firm.
6.	Reinstall wheels and tighten to about 90 ft/lbs. (start with
just tight, then lower to ground and tighten to correct torque)
7.	Check them one more time. Then drive around slowly to check.

	Now how can that be done in 30 mins, trust be the second time it
will take ½ of what the first time was, and third will be ½ of that.

	As for Pads:

	Unless you are really racing I would stick to a nice soft pad,
they work well when cold and don't make noise. Plus they cost a lot
less. Jurid is the basic OEM pad.
