Thanks to JJ, -DD, John Lowe, and Dirk Wright for the thoughts on the
intermittent cutting out problem.

The popular concensus seems to be the ignition points, maybe coil. Makes sense.

When I was assembling the engine, I took time to disassemble the
distributor to clean/lube advance mechanism, injection points, etc. The
(ignition) points were slightly pitted, but not bad. I didn't replace them
mostly because the contacts dressed up nicely with a little emery paper and
figuring that the initial wear had taken place on the rub block, they might
hold their setting better for the trip than a new set. The dwell checked
out at a solid 45 degrees.

Trip Update: They made it from Wendover to Lake Tahoe yesterday. They
reported the car ran well unless pushed above 3500 rpms in 5th, at which
point the cutting out would reappear. Problem more pronounced as it warmed
up. Cool oil temps overall, Very little oil consumption, (the engine still
has less than 1000 miles on it) and good gas mileage.

Again, thanks to all who responded. Ideally we would have had more time to
get things like this sorted out before a long road trip, but I missed this
one.
