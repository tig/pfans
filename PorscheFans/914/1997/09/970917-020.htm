Hey! I happen to think that my Audi/VW is in great shape! The paint is
great, except for the inevitable stone chips on the nose, the drivetrain
is still chuggin on just fine, only a one small oil seep at the oil pan.
It's an audi in all respects except the badge.

As for my Porsche/VW? (seeing a trend here? ;) ) I have lovingly
sacrificed _all_ to my 914. The paint although not original is still in
great shape (what little hasn't been redone due to parkinglot hits), the
engine has been treating me very very well with only a few annoying oil
leaks. I have NEVER been stranded by 914 in it's daily driver duties.
Once at an autox I elected to have it towed home, but in retrospect it
could easilly have driven home on its own without any ill effects. But
is it inexpensive to maintain? Yup. You Betcha. Ya fer sure! Is it it
worth it? Yup. You Betcha. Ya fer sure!

But I don't think I'm the "typical" used porsche owner. I'm a fanatic,
and a gear head. _AND_, I went into it with my eyes open, I knew it
would be expensive to maintain and restore. I just didn't figure it
would be quite SO expensive to restore. Now that the restoration is
pretty much done, and the initial competition prep is done, the long
uphill expenditures of racecardom are ahead.
