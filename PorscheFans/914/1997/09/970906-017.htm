I'll begin by stating that I work for Kinkos, and have had far more 
copyright training than I cared to have in my entire life (makes me 
reconsider my political science major).

Andrew Warren had it completely correct. The law forbids copying 
copyrighted material except when:

1. You own the copyright
2. You are an authorized agent of the copyright holder.
3. You are a teacher or student requesting copies of the material for        	
educational purposes in a not-for-profit educational institution.
4. You intend to file the copies as part of a public record in a court 
proceeding.
5. The material is in the public domain.

To answer the question about when a copyright expires, I'll quote the 
formula in my handy dandy handbook-

---Work created or published after Jan. 1st, 1978 are protected during 
the life of the author, plus 70 years after the author's death.

---Works published before Jan. 1st, 1978 are protected for 28 years, 
with an option to renew for an additional 67 years for a total life span 
of 95 years.

---Works made for hire, and anonymous works, are protected for 120 years 
from the date of creation, or 95 years from the date of publication. 
(read: really freaking long time)

Unfortunatly, the author in this case (guessing) would be the Porsche 
Motor Company, or whatever they call themselves, as that is what the 
document was copyrighted under (and yes 'copyrighted' is a word - 
'copywritten' is a verb only, believe it or not). Therefore, the 
copyright is valid as stated above, where the author's 'death' is 
equivalent to the company's dissolution, which will probably never 
happen in a zillion years or so.

As for the concept of 'Fair Use', it is my understanding that the 
decision to consider something copied for Fair Use or not is reserved 
entirely for the courts to decide. In other words, no one can claim Fair 
Use to copy something just because *they feel* that it's really  *fair* 
to make a nice stack of $20 bills on my Canon 800. Only later on, when 
pleaing to the appropriate charges, can the court be asked to consider 
whether or not to invoke Fair use. (Obviouly not, in my example)

I know I've just subjected you all to some of the very training I 
complained about in the beginning of this drudgery, it's just that I was 
soooo excited about finally being to *contribute* something, instead of 
lurking around trying to comprehend some of the stuff that gets thrown 
around this newsgroup.

Incidentally, I'd encourage whoever first asked about copying his set of 
manuals to ignore everything I've just written, and go ahead and copy 
the damn things. I'd love a set, if I had $175 laying around. While 
Kinkos subtly suggests you'll lose your job and go straight to hell if 
you break the copyright law, I'd argue that *buying* illegally copied is 
*not* illegal. Not sure about this, just hoping.
