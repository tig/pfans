This has gone too far.  I kept any names out of my question about the
fairness of the deal just because I did not want an arguement.  I just
wanted to know if it seemed like a fair deal.  I was dissapointed that
the gauges would need to be cleaned behind the glass at and the
condition of the console.  I did not say it was a rip off or a bad deal,
just dissapointed and felt Cory could have been clearer.  He did not
tell me what it cost to ship it.  He has offered to give me my money
back if I like,which is fair enough. I think I will pass seeing that you
guys say that these parts are hard to find and the price is more than
fair.  I didn't know.  Bill S.
