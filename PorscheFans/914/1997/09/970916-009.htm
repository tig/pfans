Car Care Specialties is where I got mine, and the Black Again and a lot of
other stuff.  Look for the ad in Panorama, call him for a catalog rather
than the AOL email.  Last time I talked to him, the mail box keeps getting
filled and with AOL limits he misses messages, etc.  Better to call.  The
catalog also has a tech section on how to treat various items.

He also lists what he likes best, though he sells lots of different lines.
And he isn't recommending the most expensive either.    I don't work for
them, etc.

He also gave me some advice over the phone when I wasn't clear on how best
to use a sequence of the products.  Familiar with the 914 also.

 Or try Larry Reynolds, carcaresp@aol.com--he's one of the guys on
(I think) the 911 list, has been a PFan (and a Pphile) for a few years now.
