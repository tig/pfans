Good Day!
In going thru a 74 2.0 motor I had bought (to replace my used up 73 1.7),
I noticed that one of the heads has replaced valve seats, the other
hasn't.  Both have new-ish valves and guides.  I pulled the valves and
the seats look great on both but the head that has the new seats apears
to have a small crack between the seats (or at least that is what it
looks like).
First question- any ideas on who in the SF bay area I should take it to? 

Second- if this is a crack, is it repairable?

Thanks in advance!
