Thought you could use some laughs!  :)

A proctologist had a burning desire to change careers and become an auto
mechanic.  So he found out from his local tech college what was
involved, signed up for evening classes, and attended diligently,
learning all he could.

 Time for the practical exam came around, he prepared carefully, and
completed the exam.  When the results came back, he was surprised to
find he had obtained a mark of 150%. 

Fearing an error, he called the instructor, saying, "I don't want to
appear ungrateful for such an outstanding result, but I wondered if
there has been an error which needs adjusting."

The instructor said, "During the exam, you took the engine apart
perfectly, which was worth 50% of the total mark. You put the engine
back together -again perfectly, which is also worth 50% of the mark.
I gave you an extra 50% because you did all of it THROUGH the exhaust
pipe!"

A man walked up to the counter of an auto parts store.  "Excuse
me," he said, "I'd like to get a new gas cap for my Porsche 924."  

"Sure," replied the clerk.  "Sounds like a fair exchange to me."
