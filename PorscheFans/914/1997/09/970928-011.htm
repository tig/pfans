Hello,I want to sell a 73 1.8 car that I got a few months ago,I need $$$ to
finish my 911 .The car was in storage for many,many years . That's why it has
17k mi on it.The car has an early AIR body kit with huge 916 style flares and
an IMSA style nose with a smooth wrap around rear bumper. It has 10"
Centerlines at all four corners,4 bolt. It was Signal Orange but it now has a
bad Blue metallic color on it.It needs work.It is solid in the rocker area
and the front trunk is very solid but the battery tray is gone,the
frame,suspension points are also solid.The car is destined to be a track car
or a rad street ride,it also has SSI . Located in LI NY.$1500 takes it.
E-mail for info,pictures available. Thnx.
