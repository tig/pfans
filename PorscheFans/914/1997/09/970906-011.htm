Brett, 

Yes, you can definitely make your own swaybar.  I have done several
times with 7/8" (almost exactly 22mm) solid steel round bar stock,
available at any steel yard for about the prices you indicate.  I think
the alloy I have used is 4136, but could check on this.

I have always used the factory-style end fittings with the 3/4" square
machining; my welder machines the ends for $30...total investment, about
$50.

Works great, although no Cad plating.
