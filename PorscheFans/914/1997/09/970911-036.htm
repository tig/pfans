I noticed that the other day as well.  While I can come up with a few
humorous possibilities, the only way I can think of to hang actual
clothes in the car is to buy enough small diameter aircraft cable to
run between the hooks and hang your clothes from that.  Otherwise,
they're not much good for anything besides an air freshener or fuzzy
dice... (or a rabbit's foot?)
