Assuming a car has provisions for sway bars but doesn't have any:

Would I be able to make a sway bar? If not WHY NOT?

The reason I ask is because I saw an ad in Excellence for 4130 (chromoly
steel) tubular sway bars for the 914... If I remember right they were about
the same price as the Weltmeisters new.  I checked on cost from our chassis
tube supplier and it would cost me about $18 for steel to make the bar
itself, then I thought I could buy the Weltmeister end-links and be ahead
of the game...  Oh and yes I have access to a tube bender.

Have I erred in reasoning here? Is there something I don't know?  Our
chassis guy at school said he didn't see any reason why it shouldn't work. 
Is there something about the 914 that would make this difficult?

Thanks for the help...
