Responding to J.J.'s request of where to start (over) and Josh's
suggestion of a new MPS:

If it is the MPS, it is most likely the metal diaphragm that drives the
internal coil. Mine cracked from fatigue. To test, suck on it and see if
it holds vacuum. However, a failed diaphragm, unless it failed during
the 20 seconds between "go" and "no-go" should not have an intermittant
effect on the system.

OK, maybe the MPS shouldn't be used to set idle. A variable resistor at
the head temp sensor does this better, but it can set or restore the
baseline mixture. I think it was sealed as part of the emmission system,
the same way late carburator jets are sealed, and not for its own
protection. I had mine apart when I swapped out the good diaphragm from
the Automotion rebuild into my old unit which was cosmetically superior.
There is not much in there that reasonable adjustment, say a half turn
turn left or right would be likely to damage.

This isn't a rave, though it sorta reads like one. Just a comment from
an equally frustrated fellow traveller.
