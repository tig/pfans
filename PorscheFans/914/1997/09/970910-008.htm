Be warned!  When our new house was still under construction I had to
move the 
914 into the garage before the asphalt was down for the driveway.  The
"lip"
up onto the garage slab was a bit more than my lowered 914 could
handle.  As
a pulled in...**WHAM**..the front engine mount hit the edge of the slab
and 
HARD.  Cursing I hopped out.

The engine mounting bar was at about a 60 degree angle, far from
perpendicular.
Continuing my string of obsenities, I got the car into the garage and
parked 
it, lamenting the fact that I needed a new bar, but glad I didn't smash
the
crankcase wide open...

Ordered used bar from AA, dropped the engine.  As it turns out it wasn't
the
mounting bar that was bent, but the metal "U-channels" that fit into the 
outboard mounts, the circular holes for the bolts/nuts from the bar
turned 
slanted and oval.  Got a couple from Stoddards and all was well with the
world.

The engine mount bar is heavy, heavy, iron and I doubt that it is bent. 
If it
is, I have an extra late front engine mount bar if anyone needs one!
