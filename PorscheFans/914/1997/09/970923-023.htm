yeah,

The gutter system on the targa roof seems pretty useless.  It does not seem
to channel water very well.  Whenever I open a door after its been raining,
water comes in.  Has anyone tried to fashion a better gutter sysem.  I was
thinking of gettin a piece of plastic about 3 fourths of an inch by a couple
feet, then use molding tape to attach it.  This would make a better "wall".
 Now it seems that many people say that this is just a good old classic
Porsche problem, but I really dont like my interior getting wet.  Any  other
ideas on how to improve the gutter?
