>Here is what I have considered:
>Pirelli P4000 VR-rated  $80  (too much of a touring tire??/Price vs
>Sleeping Indoors)
>Yokohama A509 H-rated  $75  (I've noticed these on 914s)
>Continental Contact CH90 H-rated  $65 (???)
>Sumitomo HTR100 H-rated  $60  (look pretty good for the $$$)

My PERSONAL OPINIONS (re-read those last two words before continuing)
are:

Pirelli in general:  very prone to sidewall bubbling from ANY type of
impact  - potholes, curbs, small rocks, etc.  I stay away from Pirelli
(personal experience on 2 separate occasions, further supported by an
experience my sister had with, specifically, P4000s).

Continental:  No personal experience, but hear-say on these is not good.
They're owned by one of the bigger name companies (I don't remember
which one) and they are a lesser tire than the main line by that
company.  Many models seem to be prone to belt separation.

Yokohama A509:  I'm running them on my 2.0 right now.  I've autocrossed
them 10 times and they are still going strong.  Good sticky tires with
an aggressive look.  The only drawback I've found is that they seem to
be a little hard for the tire shop to balance - maybe due to a sorry-ass
tire shop - I don't know.  I'd buy these again in a heartbeat and will
be putting a set on my wife's Nissan soon.

Sumitomo:  No experience or hear-say.  A voice inside my head when I was
considering these kept saying, "they're like Falkens... they're like
Falkens..."  so I decided against them.

Michelin:  I've never driven a Michelin I didn't like.  They're higher
priced than most the others, but I've never had bad luck with any
Michelin.  Period.  I've got a set of low-end Michs on my 73 VW
Westfalia and they saved my life and my bus one day.  If they made an
AFFORDABLE high performance tire, I'd run them on my 914 too.

Again, these are my PERSONAL OPINIONS ONLY.
