>>Here's where the warning comes in. Ordinarily, the engine pulls no more
that 10-in. Hg at idle (highest vacuum). When you (or I) connect a
Mityvac to the sensor port and pump away it is easy to generate over
20-in. of vacuum, probably closer to 30 if you just had your coffee. I
do not think this diaphram likes this at all, since if it were any
thinner it would be foil. In testing over the last two years or so, I
probably did more to create the metal fatigue than in 20 years of
driving. Now I've got to order a new pressure sensor. Ouch.<<

Don't think so!  My engine idles with 15 - in Hg and it can and does see
20-25 in Hg when the throttle is suddenly closed.  A vacuum gauge is a
good way to check for various problems in your engine.  Not very high
tech, but very accurate.  I can even set my timing with a good vacuum
gauge.

Take care,
