My first car was a bright tangerine 914.  For relibility and practicality
reasons I settled into a toyota camry (modified with Eibach/KYB suspension
and 205/50ZR-16 yokoyama AVS-I tires  aka granny-pusher with nice wheels
and the proper ride :)

Mom wanted the 914 outta her space and either sold or in *my* driveway.
The car has been sitting for 6 years.  5 Years ago I tried to drive it
until I noticed fuel gushing up 6 feet in the air.  Yesterday I took 10
feet of 8mm fuel line (I think a mm too big, but it fits) and replaced all
the leaky stuff plus a little extra.  I'll replace the rest when I can
drop the engine.  After draining the old gas and replacing it with 4
gallons of fresh mixed with redline lead substitute and a dose of redline
SI-1 *and* replacing the dead battery with a grand auto $30 special, I
pressurized the fuel system (wiggle the intake stator flap of the
L-jetronic) and then started it up....after cranking the engine for about
7 seconds.  Pretty good for a car that hasn't been started for 5 years!
It sounds just as fresh as it did when I retired it. Archaic as it may be
I think there must be an L-jetronic addage, "when it works, it works
well"!  All the lights work except the passanger side headlight sometimes
doesn't want to pop up (sigh).  I'll have to check the wiring on that.

I could put the car into gear however.  The clutch cable must have
stretched out because the clutch is not disengaging when the pedal hits
the floor (the cable *is* operating the clutch...I had mom stomp on it
while I checked the tranny underneath).  Are there any other possibilities
for a car that was working fine 6 years ago and hasn't seen a mile since?

I'm looking forward to getting the car mobile so I can have some top down
fun before I eventually park a Boxster alongside.
