For David Condreay and other interested parties:

Hi David!

   You asked:

"   I've been 'shooting my cabin wiring harness the past weeks and
I've hit something I don't understand:  Why are the three fan-speed
wires on the heater control  'hot' (test probe to chassis ground)? 
The car came to me from PO with the blower fan in/op.  The way I'm
reading the schematic they should be 'cold' until the switch
'grounds' to complete the circuit.  Is 'hot' normal?  Jeez, this is
fun!   "

  Yes, the way that I read the Haynes book, all three leads should be
"hot" until grounded.   I am making a couple of assumptions here....
you didn't say what year car, so I assumed '73, as it I believe that
it had the largest production volume, and you did say something about
the "heater" control, but the fresh-air blower is the only one that I
can find that is three-speed, so I assumed you meant that one.

   Consider:  Using conventional current flow, the path is from the
fuse block ( +12 volts ) through the motor windings, and then through
one of three paths back to the switch: path 3 direct and paths 1 and
2 through resistors of different sizes to slow the motor.  The switch
connects one of these three paths to ground, completing the circuit
and selecting the speed, or leaves all three paths open (off).
   When the switch is off  (or if the path to ground is open) then
all three leads will be essentially at +12 volts, as the resistance
of the motor and the resistors is fairly low compared to most test
instruments.   Using an external test lead to short the three leads
from the motor to ground one at a time should cause it to run at it's
various speeds.  If not, then the motor is open (or shorted, if you
get a big spark and a blown fuse).  If the motor runs OK, then the
problem is either in the switch or it's path to ground.   If you can
identify the ground wire (usually brown) and measure the voltage on
it, it should be close to zero volts under all conditions.  If it
rises to something like +12 volts when the switch is on, then you
have a bad connection from the switch to the vehicle chassis.   If
not, you have a defective switch.

					Good Luck,
                                                            Jim T.
