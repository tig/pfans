I'm going to assume that they (the tuners) are refering to "built"
engines. Sure, the more power you squeeze out of an existing engine, the
shorter it's life will be. If I ever give in and make the switch up to
A-Prepared for my car, you betcha I'll have a built-to-the-hilt motor
that I'll only expect 10 hours of engine life out of. But that's of
course contingent on finding $1M in small unmarked bills in a big
satchel that just "fell" from a small overflying plane. In other words,
not damn likely.

Also this assumes that all engines are built alike. I'm pretty sure that
the engines they refer to have considerably higher compression than the
7.6:1 that a stock 2.0 'teener has.
