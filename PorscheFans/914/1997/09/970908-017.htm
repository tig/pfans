	OK, one last thought on the late-style 5 MPH bumpers.  The
looks are a matter of taste (tin-foil or plastic, take your pick)
and it is nice that the car can survive a parking-lot bump that
hits the bumper with little or no damage.  The bumpers may even
make you a little less likely to get hurt in an accident.
	But please don't believe for a moment that they actually
make you *safer*.  The instant you start thinking that, you will
tend to drive less carefully.  The more secure you feel, the less
likely you are to pay complete attention to the road.  I call this
the "Volvo syndrome".  To quote from the "Two grumpy guys" who came
up with the Highway 17 Page of Shame, "...You drive a tank, so you
don't have to look where you're going."
	I have been the victim of this syndrome (a slightly dif-
ferent version) once before.  Someone driving another car (a non-
Volvo, if it makes a difference) relied on their anti-lock brakes
to stop them before they plowed into my car's rear bumper.  They
knew they had ABS, so they were busy looking in their mirrors
instead of looking at the road in front of them.  They felt secure
that their car could stop quickly and easily, so they drove less
carefully.
	Other examples include four-by-four trucks in the (rare)
California snows.  A driver knows he has a 4x4, and knows that it
can still move on snow.  So he drives at the regular speed limit,
forgetting that he still can't brake and turn like he was on dry
pavement.  Every time I go skiing in Tahoe, I see two or three of
these big trucks in the ditch.  The driver feels secure about his
vehicle, and stops driving carefully.
	Motorcycle drivers tend to be the opposite way--at least,
the ones that survive.  They *know* that they will come out second-
best in any collision with another vehicle, so they stay alert at
all times.  I'd bet that there is very little sense of security on
a bike.

	It would be wonderful if the 75-6 bumpers do indeed protect
you some in an accident.  But don't count on it--pretend you are
completely defenseless in an accident, and you will be less likely
to be involved in one.  Getting out of the way is the surest way not
to be injured.
