I was driving around last night and had an odd thought.  (Be warned-
these happen with some regularity... ;-)

The Honda Goldwing has a liquid cooled 1500cc horizontal 6 cyl (boxer)
that is newer and (arguably) more reliable than the 25 year old mill
in my 914.  Has anyone ever looked at putting one into a 914?  It'd
be nice to bring the tranny, too, except for two issues:  the transaxle,
and reverse.  (Goldwings have a reverse now, but it's kind of funky:
you have to turn the motor off, put the tranny in first, and push a
special button that (I believe) turns the starter motor backwards.)

Other than that, the transmission would be a dream- push forward
to downshift, pull back to upshift, clutch optional once you're
rolling.  (All bikes have full-synchro transmissions.  If you're
any good, all you have to do is pick the right RPM range, preload
the shifter, and lift off the throttle for a fraction of a second
to take the load off the tranny long enough to change gears.  You
probably don't want to do it all the time, but for autox or other
racing it'd be a nice feature...)

The radiator space seems to be minimal, which helps some of the
problems with other liquid-cooled motors...

Just think- we'd have a whole other series of /6 conversions ;-)

OK- I've got the nomex shorts on.  Tell me why it won't work...

I'm in the process of sorting through the '75 2.0L I just bought.  When I got 
the car the turn signals didn't work (no blinking) although with the motor off, 
the side marker lights worked, so I assumed the turn signal switch was OK.  I 
replaced the turn signal relay without problem.  I now have normally working 
turn signals and warning flashers, but it has developed a new problem.

Now whenever the ignition is turned on (both motor running and motor stopped) 
the brake warning light flashes.  This flashing is at twice the rate of the turn 
signals or warning flashers.  In the Haynes manual, the wiring diagram for the 
'75 does not even include a pressure switch on the master cylinder.  Any ideas?  
Is there a reset on the pressure switch on the master cylinder like there was on 
some 911's?

I guess I'm being introduced to the joys of 914 ownership.

Thanks in advance,
