	Nick,
	Spend the $30 or $40 for a pair of jack stands. They don't have
to be that tall :) Put a 2 X 6 or larger board under the engine and rest
the board on the jack stands. Measure the height of your 914 and then
measure the height of the stands at the store- I used to have to do
a lift, jury-rig one stand, put a big chunk of wood between the floor jack
and my jack-point adaptor and do a SECOND lift to get my '71 1.7 up on
the stands I own.

BE CAREFUL anyway. Yeah, you can be sporty and use the jack and put the 
spare tire under the car and only use the arm you can live without... 

	Re: the coat hooks,  Ahh, seat-belt hangers... sure! I just figured 
it was just Teutonic thoroughness. The single-cab VW pickup has 'em too,
with the same shape cabin. Maybe that's why I bought it?!

	Bill
