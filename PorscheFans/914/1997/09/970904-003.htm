two things that i'm sure won't really need to be said about the rockers:

1. also check for the strength/integrity of the body under the removable
stain. steel or black plastic threshold plate when you take it off to
remove the rockers.  i found that i had to rebuild one of mine due to
the rust. check it carefully as the damage may not be readily apparent!
i'd wondered why the door didn't quite fit right! : )  see if any damage
has also approached the pan. (no jokes here, guys, please!)

2. i'm sure you wouldn't even consider this but DON'T use any of those
fiberglass rocker cover covers-- the ones that fit OVER the regular
steel ones.  this masks whatever damage you might have-- sort of like
aluminum siding.  the fiberglass REPLACEMENT covers might not be so bad
(esp. if you are doing some sort of 916 look), but you might want to
(and i know this sounds bizarre) caulk at each possible entry point.
that seemed to work for me, but then i wasn't racing.  perhaps the added
weight of that might be too much and i did worry a bit about trapped
moisture.
