look.  As with everything else in this rebuild, there was another little
suprise waiting for me.  A crack (~1/4 inch) running out from each of the
spark plug holes.  Somehow I suspect I'll see the same on the other head.
Any suggestions on a good place to get them repaired?  Any place in
Colorado?  Of course, I might as well get them flycut, check the valve
guides, replace the exhaust valves, and get the seats and intake valves cut
while they're at it...  And the ports look like they could use a little
cleanup too.

Andy,

Before you start fly cutting, calc your expected compression ratio.  You
might not need them flycut, just cleaned up real good.  I took mine into my
mechanic telling him I wanted them flycut, and he refused.  I'm glad he
did.  But then again, if you want higher compression and are using an
aftermarket FI or carbs, you probably will want to take off a little.  But
still, calc the compression ratio and your clearances.

Good luck,

Dion
