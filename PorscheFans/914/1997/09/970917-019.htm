I can't let this one go by: I've seen more old Porsches, by percentage
of their manufacture, than nearly any other car. Of course, they
eventually
depreciate to where people can buy them who really can't afford to
maintain them, and the inevitable decline follows. They have always been
expensive to maintain properly, and yet robust enough to soldier on even
when poorly maintained. My 23 year old 914 just made a 1000 mile round
trip to Branson, Mo. and used 1/2 quart of oil, and returned 34+ MPG in
the bargain, at a significantly extralegal pace, and did so with very
little special preparation beyond Zymol and Rainex. If you really want
to see what a maintenance intensive car looks like when it falls to a
lower price strata, check out all the 5 yr plus Audi's out there, if you
can find one.
