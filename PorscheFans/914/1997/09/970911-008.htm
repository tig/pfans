I called Dennis Frick, the chairman of the Parade Competition Rules
Committee, to clear up the new tire size rules and how they would affect
our 914's. He said to go to the Classification Charts for Class P3 (1.7 and
1.8 914's) and P4 (2.0 914's) and simply cross out the two lines that refer
to tire circumference and the penalty points assigned by using tires of
smaller diameter than original stock.

What does this accomplish? Up until now, if you ran 205 50 tires, the
circumference was about 72 inches causing you to incur one point in Column
C and you would be bumped to class I1. Now, 205 50 tires Are OK for staying
in the Production Class. The penalty for Race, Recap, and under 50 Series
DOT Tires remains in effect but just about any tire with a 50 or over
aspect ratio can be used.

Penalty points for Rim width, Less than 15 inch wheels, Track increase up
to 2", and Modified fender and/or Wheel opening remain unchanged. 

How can I use the points freed up by this change? If I were running 195 60
tires to stay in Production Class and were incurring 3 points for using
them, I can now put on 205 50's and use the points to increase my rim size
up to 7 inches if I felt it would help.
