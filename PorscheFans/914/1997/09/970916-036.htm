Well, it's going to be getting cold in Milwaukee any week now, and I 
don't want to give up my 914 project. I was thinking of finishing my 
engine drop, and hauling all the engine/transmission/exhaust bits to my 
basement for a winter rebuild. 

Fortunatly (for this endeavor), I live alone (can you guess?), and would 
annoy no one but the upstairs neighbors, who think I'm strange already 
anyway.

I have only books and no experience to guide me, and I'd like to be able 
to hook up a remote fuel source/cooling fans/whatever to my car bits. 
I'm hoping I can run the engine occasionally for diagnostic purposes, 
and dread the idea of putting everything back in the car just to drop it 
again because I screwed something up. How feasible is this? Lots of 
electrical stuff will still be in my car outside (gauges, fuel pump, who 
knows what else). I understand I'll need something for fuel pressure.

What I want to know is, how dumb of an idea is this? Will I have 
everything I need to regulate to engine? Are there some unremovable bits 
on the car that you need to have for correct drivetrain operation? I 
really hate working in the cold...

Incidentally, I already anticipated two responses:
		1.Buy a giant heater. (Tried it last winter - toughest canary I could 
find croaked from the fumes. Had to give up.)
		2.Move someplace warmer. (Sunshine is for sissies.)
