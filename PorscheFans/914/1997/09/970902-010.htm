	Jim S. pretty much covered it, but he forgot about a couple of
pieces of engine cooling sheetmetal.  There is a piece that is directly
in front of the alternator.  It is held on by a long 10mm bolt, plus the
alternator pivot bolt, and maybe one or two more screws.  (Nasty, evil
slot-head screws.  Buy the biggest screwdriver Sears sells--that's the
only one I've found that fits them...)
	The other piece of sheetmetal is the piece at the left-front of
the engine.  There are about five or six screws that hold it onto the
other sheetmetal in the area.  You can only remove a couple of them from
the bottom, the others have to be removed from the top.
	In addition to unhooking the wires Jim mentioned, it's a good
idea to pull/push them through the holes in the engine tin until they are
in the same area as the alternator.
	The rubber cooling hose for the alternator may have a big hose
clamp on it; that takes a Phillips-head screwdriver.
	Even when you get the alternator disconnected from everything, it
will still take some wiggling and maneuvering to get it to come out.  And
it will try to fall on your head when it does.  Trust me...
	Your local auto electric place may be able to rebuild the alter-
nator for a more reasonable amount of money than most places want for
Bosch-rebuilt ones.  Check around for a reputable place.

	You'll be working on your back in cramped quarters with your hands
up over your head for a while.  Take lots of breaks and move your
shoulders around--I was sore for half a week after the last time I did
this job.

	Gary's method (pull the motor first) definitely has its advantages,
but pulling the motor is very intimidating until you've actually done it.
