Well, my opinion is that because you're building a "dry weather car" you
should run the best dry weather tires that you can afford.  In general, a
Z-rated tire will give you much better traction than a V- or H- rated tire.
 This is because the Z-rated stuff is "higher performance" with better
(although faster wearing) compounds.  Too bad none of us need the 150+ mph
performance that these tires are capable of :(

I'm running Dunlop SP-Sport D-40/M2 in 195/50zr15 on factory fuchs.  This
gives me better gearing for acceleration, and better grip (1" lower cg, no
other changes :)  This is my daily driver, and up here in Vancouver, we get
"above average rainfall" so occasionally I need good rain tread.  

Your alignment should also be tailored for the type of driving that you
do--an aggressive alignment will give you better handling and grip, but
isn't the thing you want for extended freeway driving.
