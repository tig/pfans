I've done business with Cory on several different occasions and have
been quite happy with the prices/quality of the parts I have bought from
him as well as his knowledge about 914s in general.  $50 for a console,
gauges, and oil temp sender is pretty cheap - I typically see them for
$100 and up.  And if he ate the shipping charges, its a down-right
steal.

An original, working clock will bring $50-$100 by itself (pretty hard to
find too).  As to the missing bracket, when a console was cut to
accommodate an AC unit, the top bracket was usually thrown away because
it was positioned in the area that got cut away (ACs were all dealer
installed so some might have been done better than others).  Also, there
is a rear spacer (wooden) that keeps the rear width, but a lot of times
those have been removed by people (like me) with big, wide feet because
there isn't enough room to get your foot off the gas pedal without some
'adjustments'.

It doesn't really look like Cory mis-represented anything to you and all
in all, it sounds like you got an OK deal.

Just my opinion.
