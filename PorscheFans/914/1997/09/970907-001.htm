I am the lucky owner of a '76 2.0l with serious rust under the battery.
There is a hole that I can put my fist through directly ahead of the rear
suspension console/trailing arm mount.  Minor rust through in the rear
floor pan area.  I've also got that crunchy feeling around the parking
brake and passenger seat belt mount (outer).  It's got body flex, hard to
open doors with windows rolled up.

Now before you just say "run fast, run far", I'd like to hear some war
stories about how others have dealt with this type of situation (I know
you're out there, elsewise the parts catalogs wouldn't have all those
"rustoration" parts).  The rest of the car is in great shape, good motor,
trans, body, paint, interior, alloy wheels, sway bars, fog lamps, center
console, etc.

All I have been able to find in any discussion list is "it is expensive and
time consuming".  Could you please spend a few minutes elaborating on your
experiences?

I'm trying to figure out the following:

1). How much $$$?
2). What do I look for in a body shop to do this work (i.e. do they need a
"jig", what kind of welding techniques, etc.)?
3). What is the closest shop to me that has a good track record doing this
kind of job (Kansas City)?  (Brad Mayeur, can you help?)
4). What parts place is good for these kind of parts (AA, Doc & Cy's, GPR,
Automotion, etc.)?

My main objectives are:

1). Regain structural integrity (I want it to pass "Dave's Big Butt Test")
2). Primary use, weekend driver
3). Occasional autocross
4). Don't need concours quality, just reliability

I can't do this myself as I don't have the skills or tools (welder) to do
the work.

TIA for your replies.
