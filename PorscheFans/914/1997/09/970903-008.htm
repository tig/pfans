 James,
 This is a good thing that you're doing.  My car was for all practical
purposes very clean.  I pulled the rockers off in preparation for the
painter and I think a third of the dirt formerly known as the state of
California dumped out on my garage floor.  It was especially clumped around
the jack holes.  Very Nasty.

To remove the rockers:
Borrow a rivet gun and buy some rivets first.  You'll need them for
reassembly.
Lay some plastic down on the floor under the rocker (trust me).
Remove the bolts at each end of the rocker.
Open the door and carefully drill out the existing rivets using a sharp 1/8"
drill bit.  Viola!

When you reassemble I would recommend that you install the fore and aft
bolts (don't forget the rubber cushions) semi-loosely.  Then re-rivet.  Then
tighten the bolts.  A touch of black paint on the rivet heads completes the
job.

Also.  Personal preference, here.  After cleaning the longitudenal rocker
(parts under the cover) I sprayed the entire area with a rubberized
undercoat product.  Adds weight, but it's smart weight for a daily driver.

Regards,

Dave

Any tips on removing/replacing the rocker covers on a 914?  Mine have some
superficial rust (especially around the jack point) and I want to see what
is
underneath before I get too far into building my PCA club racer.

Thanks
