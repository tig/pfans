	I finally decided that the black bits coming out of my own car's
exhaust pipe on warm-up were bits of muffler batting.  My muffler isn't
so much a muffler any more, as it is a resonating chamber for the exhaust.
	Well, I don't *think* the neighbors hate me, why do you ask?  ;^)

	Sounds like the mixture is too lean.  If you've still got a pot
in line with the head temp sensor, try tweaking it to higher resistance.
Increasing the fuel pressure will also richen the mixture, but it will
result in different behavior during different operating conditions--such
as warm-up.  When the driving-around behavior gets better, set the idle
mixture with the screw on the ECU.
