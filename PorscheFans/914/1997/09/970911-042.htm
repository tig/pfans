A big part of resurrecting my 74 1.8 was replacing the all the flexible
fuel lines in the engine compartment.  At first only a few leaked, but
most of the others  started leaking after a day so I replaced them all.
Yesterday the car passed smog and I got new plates.  When I was about to
take her to the parts store today to get some winshield epoxy for the
rearview (it fell off years ago in storage) I noticed some fuel smell.  A
flexible line near the fuel pump is leaking so I'll probably replace the
lot of them under there tomorrow.  Maybe those hoses don't like new gas?

My question is:  Where else do flexible rubber lines lurk on the 74 1.8?
It looks like the lines between the front and rear are rigid plastic.  I
imagine the lines connecting these to the tank are flexible rubber (I
wonder if those will fail next week?)  Any others that might need
replacing?  Also, does the rigid plastic hose last or will I have to
replace that too?

Moved the fire extinguisher from my other car (late model toyota not
likely to go up in flames) to behind the 914 driver's seat...

Thanks for all advice!  I don't want her to up in flames.  She was my
first car after all.
