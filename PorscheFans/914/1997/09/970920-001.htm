I don't remember if you checked this but how is your fuel pressure.
Could you have rust in the tank.  Have you hooked up a pressure gauge
and driven around to see if it varies.  I know this sounds backwards
but.. I had a Saab with jtronic injection and if the pressure dropped it
would get rich.  The book Saab actually said that.  The other thing
would be to check all your connections on the board on the driver's side
of the engine compartment.  You can chip the goop off the bottom and
check solder/ crimp joints.  I haven't been there myself but have heard
people that should know describe doing so.  My suspicion is that you
have a bad connection, intermittants will drive you crazy.  Good Luck
and just so you know, it doesn't bother me at all that you keep trying
to get your car fixed with the groups help.  I think that is a good part
of why we're here.   Peace   Bill S.
