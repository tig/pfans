I'm still working on this rocker arm devil. I have a partial solution, which
I ordered parts for this morning. This solution gets rid of the spring
between the rockers and replaces it with a shaft collar and some shims. This
shoud reduce some of the friction in the valve train anyway. It's also a no
brainer modification that anyone can do. The collar goes in the middle on
the rocker shaft bewteen the rocker arms and then shims are added to each
side to take up clearances. No, I don't know yet what the clearance should
be. The collars are 14mm wide and the distance between the rockers is about
18.1mm. So, you need about 4mm worth of shims (2 on each side of the
collar). I ordered some 0.5mm shims also because I only measured one rocker
arm set (ran out of time). They also have thinner shims too, down to 0.1mm.
The thin shims goes towards the collar, the thicker ones go towards the
rocker arms. I ordered the parts from M&MCC (that fabulous catalog that I've
been raving about lately) for 18 bucks. The parts are:

qty     number          description             cost
4       705A 20         20mm collar             7.12
20      988 20x28x1     1mm shim                4.25
20      988 20x28x0.5   0.5mm shim              3.42
                                     subtotal   14.79
                                        S+H     3.00
                                        total   17.79

They are at: 800-431-2792 in New York state.
