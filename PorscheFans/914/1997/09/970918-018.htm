Well, OK. It was running lean, my plugs looked almost white when I
pulled  them after I got home, with just the slightest hint of tan, but
I had the little hose to the decceleration valve wide open (vacuum
leak), and it was a little poochie above 3,400 RPM in 5th, and, I am
running tires a little shorter than the speedometer is geared for, and I
didn't actually measure the gas mileage while in Branson, merely to
there, and back again, but I do know that Gordon L. was getting about
18-20 on the trip in his 6'er (not that I wouldn't take it and that in a
heartbeat), and when it comes to gas, all I can really testify to, is
that I sure had
one on the trip.                Jim S.
 PS. Gord also told me that Keith was careening around the countryside
in that  yellow 1.8 so 30.whatever wasn't too bad.
