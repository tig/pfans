Yes, they rebuilt my heads about  6 months ago.  They were the only
place that I could find that would warrantee, much less replace, my
valve seats.  This alone did it for me.  I was pleased with the work
that they did, and it was nice to find a place that actually "cared"
about my heads, rather than just looking at them as another
couple-hundred dollars in work.  I can't say I heard anything bad about
them, but I guess there's a first time for everything...
