Yeah, and what about all those 928's and 944's for dirt cheap? A friend of
mine was intent on owning a 928 until he subscribed to the porschefans 928
list and found out that just about every repair on the vehicle was a
thousand dollars. Replace the timing belt? 1,000$ Fix the leaky transaxle?
1,000$, etc, etc.

Every 928 we went to look at (I was lobbying him hard to get one) had oil on
the bottom of both the crank case and the transaxle. Many had been butchered
with alterations and bad paint jobs. When you've got an engine that's what?
10 grand to get rebuilt, service records take on a new meaning. I hear
Porsche is offering special financing on 928's these days. 

And I still don't understand why a late 60's to early 70's 911 sells for 10
grand, or why an early 912 is almost that much. It just doesn't make sense.
