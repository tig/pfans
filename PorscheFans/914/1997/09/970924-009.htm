You do know that the fiberglass stuff is _not_ stock?  Yeah, some 
brands don't fit so well....

You _may_ have bent the innards.  Yup, probably dumb.

Haynes lies.  New calipers are $400 each.  Rebuild kits can be
gotten for $30 (or so).

You'll need to clean up the wiring.  Could be dirty contacts, or 
a wire in the wrong spot.  Get the correct schematic and do it right.

Have you checked all the fuses?  

>  3  I havn't been able to find much info on the L-jet  F.I.

L-jets are (were) pretty popular.  And work well when connected
properly.  I'm a D-jet kind of guy, but there's lots of L-jet
information in this "group".
