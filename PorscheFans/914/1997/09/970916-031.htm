They all are prone to failure. If you want to get just the bushings that
are bad, you'll still have to tear into the sucker to find out which
ones are bad.

A full set of bushings. However, it may not solely be the bushings. It
could simply be a poorly adjusted linkage. If you have a haynes manual
(and everyone should) there's a very good adjustement description.

Oil. And if the car has sat for a long time, dust burning off, but that
doesn't last long.

Keep oil off of your exhaust pipes. The exhaust pipes are what supply
the heat, and if you have a pushrod seal leak or valve cover gasket
leak, then oil can drip onto the pipes, into the heat exchangers and
hence the smell. It's either fix the leaks, get a brand new set of SS
heat exchanges which are seam welded to keep the leaking oil out, or
wear warmer clothing. I think it's pretty clear which way to go...
