    I am looking to buy a nice 914 and was wondering if you folks have
any opinions on which year and engine is best.  I have a 68'
Karmann-Ghia right know which is just fine but would like more
"cornering power."  The last sports car purchase I made without
researching first was a disaster.  Ever try to find a master cylinder
for a 67' BMW 1600?
    I am not looking for alot of speed just a healthy dose of G forces.
If you know of any good, clean 914's in Albuquerque NM please let me
know.  Or better yet it would be nice to meet with somebody to show me
theirs here in town!  Any help is greatly appreciated!
