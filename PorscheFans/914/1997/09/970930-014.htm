Dan makes a very important point that I didn't stress enough. A race
seat is for RACING. And is built to help keep you and your car two
sepparate entities in the event of a crash. Becoming one with the car is
great in a figurative sense, not so good in a literal sense.

As I said inmy last post regarding the Koenig seat is FIA aproval. Most
of the good race seats on the market will be FIA approved. Given the
choice, I'll always pick an FIA seat over a non-approved one. Consider
them (FIA) the Snell rating for seats. However, don't discount fit. If
it doesn't fit you, like you're too small for the seat (my problem) then
a harness may not hold you in place securely enough. Because seats like
these are built for certain size drivers, select your seat accordingly.
You can find good entry level race seats from sparco and the like for
around $300 or so. The next step up is around $500 for a really nice
one, and $700 for the really slick lightweight comfy ones. (can you tell
I've been looking into seats? :)
