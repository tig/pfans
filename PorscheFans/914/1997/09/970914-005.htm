I have toyed with the idea of purchasing a 914 for several years but didn't have the nerve 
to try it: too many things that can go wrong, its cold blooded heritage that will leave it stall 
on a December morning right as I cross the train tracks...you get the idea.

Just drove a '74 2L, had a great time...but was appalled at the amount of work it 
needed...and this was one in good condition! 

Concerning maintanence, I am checked out on the VW Type I,II,III engines, have done 
all of my own work, engine replacements, etc for years. But I don't have time to be taking 
the car apart every weekend anymore; the halcyon days of college are gone.

So, what I am (to make a sort story a novel) is a chap that earnestly wants to get into this 
racket 'cause he loves these cleverly designed cars, but is hesitant because of all of the 
troubles he has seen with them. So, HONESTLY, what are your maintenance 
experiences like? Is it in the shop every fortnight? Or more often? Or less? I would be 
using this kind of car as a daily driver; am I asking for trouble? What is the realistic 
expense for parts, or would I be better off to sigh and go buy an MR2?


Much thanks in advance for any wisdom you might have.


Marshall
