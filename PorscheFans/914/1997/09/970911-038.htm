RWB:

It's been a long time since I had stock seatbelts in my 914, so I
can't go out and check, but I BELIEVE that the hooks are for hanging
up your seatbelts... Before they started building 914s with
retractable seatbelts, this would have been useful.

If you really NEED to hang your dry-cleaning in your 914, try
stringing a clothesline between the two hooks... A length of piano
wire with a loop crimped onto each end would work real well.
