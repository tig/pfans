The reason why is that the NHRA is alot less rule-happy, that and they
don't have as many differnt series. SCCA has many different series.
Solo, Improved Touring, GT, Trans-am, Production and Rally, to name but
a few. And all have different rules that pertain to those categories.

To include the complete rules set for every series that the SCCA
'sponsors' would take something the size of a phone book. And most
people don't compete in every series and would resent having to pay for
a huge book that they only need a small part of. Now you can get the GCR
(General Competition Rules) from SCCA which will cover the basics that
pertain to most if not all of SCCAs road racing rules. It does not
however, cover vehicle specifics. That will require a book with a
complete car listing for whatever series you want to (or plan to) run
in.

If you're interested in what the rules are for SCCA Solo2 (autox) as
they pertain to the Stock and Street Prepared categories (not Prepared
or Modified however), these rules (SCCA approved) are available on the
web at:

You can probably find it on this site:

I had investigated it pretty thoroughly a little while back. I talked
with alot of people, racers, builders, as well as ACC. Here's what I
came up with. 

1]	The stock fan delivers more air at higher rpms, while the electric
one is capable of delivering much more at low rpms. This would
neccesistate a temperature feedback to reduce the possibility of
over-cooling. The removal of the stock oil cooler I believe is required
for the conversion, and as such would neccesitate a large oil cooler in
a cold-air flow somewhere. The front would be the best.

2]	The electric setup is certainly _alot_ lighter, and certainly reduces
a significant amount of load on the crank shaft. How much power this
actually frees up is still conjecture.

3]	The conversion requires a dual carb setup, or something very similar.
You cannot use it with the stock FI hardware.

4]	The conversion does not account for the use of the alternator, and I
havn't yet heard if there is a retrofit to retain the alternator. 

5]	Opinions are mixed among racers. Some of them say it's the greatest
thing since sliced bread. Others say that don't trust it. Not that it
won't free up power or reduce weight, but if the electric fans fails, or
looses power in any way, there is no way to know that it has stopped and
in a very short amount of time, your engine goes KER-POW! If you're
lucky, all you'll need are new heads. This is the biggest drawback I see
to this setup. I would probably use it on a race car, and am still
considering exactly that. If the fan goes and temps start to soar, you
can just shut it down get a tow back to the pits or paddock and load it
onto your trailer. If you're observant enough to catch it in the first
place. If it goes somewhere out there on the road, you're S.O.L.

So, for a race/competition only car, it just might be the hot ticket.
_IF_ the rules you're competing under allow such a modification.
