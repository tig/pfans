I checked the #914chat channel on dal.net last weekend several times,
but no one was ever there.  I noticed that people had been there, since
the "topic" had changed.  I'd have to say the best time for me to chat
would be during the weekends, anytime between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. mountain
time.  Hope to see some of you there!
