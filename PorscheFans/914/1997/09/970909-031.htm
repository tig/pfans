For Jeff Lorentzen and other interested parties:

Hi Jeff!

  Mine does the same thing;  the tach is electronic, which means that
what you have is essentially a 270 degree D'Arsonval meter movement. 
 The damping action of a meter movement depends on the external
resistance of the driving circuit.  For high-quality meter movements,
the meter coil resistance is relatively high, making the movement
fairly sensitive.   Therefore, the current required to drive it to
full deflection is quite small (on the order of from 1 millampere to
50 microamperes, depending on the meter) and therefore, the driving
circuitry, being designed to deliver small currents, has a
correspondingly high impedance... i.e. little or no damping.  
  
    I believe that the overshoot is normal behaviour for the above
described reason; anyone else care to comment?

                                                            Jim T.
