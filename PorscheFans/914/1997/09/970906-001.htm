I'm pretty much sold on Leamon Stansell's 74 2.0 but I want to drive it
first.  Problem is: I'm waiting for him to put the new engine in... I'm not
complaining though... he's been very busy and very understanding of my
impatient calling to check up.

In the meantime to try and quench my appetite for anything 914 I'm going to
look at other cars today.  I called on a couple 73 2.0s advertised in the
paper. After talking with both owners a couple things worry me.

1)	Neither of them knew if theirs cars had swaybars.
2)	Neither knew what the 2.0L alloys were (one knew what Rivierras were
because they were on his car)
3)	Both of them were adamant that the center console (with the gauges) was
an option which neither of their cars had.
4)	Neither knew how to tell if they had the actual Porsche 2.0 or a stroked
and poked 1.7/1.8.
5)	One said that the car was maintained by Otto's, a very well recommended
Porsche shop.  The owner told me to call Otto's and that they knew more
about the car than he did.  To which I answered, "Is it your car?" "Of
course," he said.

I probably wont be seriously looking at either just because they frighten
me... I don't know... When I got my first car, a 65 Barracuda Formula S, I
knew that thing inside and out... I even knew how much the seat frames
weighed (lighter is faster you know).  Maybe its just me but I would think
that owning a Porsche is more than just getting in starting it up and
heading for work.  I think that a Porsche is more than just a racy,
babe-magnet of a car its an experience (sounds like something an army
recruiter would say).  I just find it weird to see people that own a car
that generates so much enthusiasm for driving, racing, and winning in me,
yet they cant even tell you what motor oil their using ("Whatever the
Jiffy-lube uses").

Boy... I really need a 914...

If anyone knows Leamon please tell him to take his time and to reiterate
that I'm not trying to be a pest, just an enthusiast.

That's enough rambling for one night... Gotta start drinking the decaf
Pepsi...
