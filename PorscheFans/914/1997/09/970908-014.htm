Here's one for you electrical wizards:
Symptoms:
1)  My ignition switch sticks sometimes.  
2)  The car stops sometimes when the ignition switch is turned off, but other
times, only when you press on the brake petal.
3)  The turn signals work but both dash board indicators blink at the same
time regardless of whether you are turning left or right.
4)  Occasionally while driving the ignition goes off.  The car continues to
have spark but runs out of gas (no electric fuel pump).  Gages are dead.  But
starter motor works.  This can be corrected by turning on the lights which
appears to "shock" the system into coming back on.  
5)  There was a anti theft switch wired in under the dash with a toggle
switch.  It appears to be in good working order.
6)  There is a new battery in with a new ground cable (2 months ago).
7)  The starter motor works fine.
8)  All lights and fuses are in good working order with the exception of the
high beam lights.  They work when you pull back on the headlight flasher but
do not stay on when you switch to the high beams.

Well, what do you think?
