Depends on how much cleaning it needs.  I had seen smoke when I left it on
too long so wanted to see everything.

To remove the whole unit you will need to pull the tank.  There is a cover
on the back of the blower that you may be able to remove without.  You will
probably have to remove the carbon canister on the tank and the
overflow/vapor container. Then you can see the back of the blower easily.
There are some metal slide clips, I think 2 facing the tank, and 2 on each
side.  If these are slid off you might be able to remove that back piece
then reach in and remove leaves, etc.

I pulled everything out before I removed these so I'm guessing at the
above.  You may run into a problem with the top rubber seal, a rectangular
seal around the top opening.  It was fairly well stuck to the inside on
mine and I was trying to save it without tearing it.

It may lead to a case of 'while you are at it' but you may want to pull the
tank anyway if you never have.  The hardest part is clamping and removing
the bottom hoses from underneath the car.  With the stuff you have to
remove from the top anyway, about the only thing left once the lower hoses
are free is to unbolt the hold down strap and lift out the tank.  There are
fiber pads in at least three places between the tank and the body.  These
are perfect for absorbing water and causing rust spots on the body and tank
at those points.  I cleaned these up, coated with POR15, and may use rubber
sheet instead of the fiber pads.   There was also a lot of crude and
dropped items under the tank.  When I replace the tank I'll put longer
hoses on so next time I can pull the tank up high enough to clamp and
disconnect from the trunk area.

There are 2 drain outlets from the upper blower housing, these have plastic
hoses that tee into a single one and go to a drain hole on the floor.  One
of these was cracked and the bottom of house had slipped out of the drain
hole so any water would dump right into the body under the tank.  There is
a drain for this area, if it hasn't been plugged by crude.

Whatever way you do it be careful with these, the plastic of the blower
housing and the drain hoses is very brittle from age.  I broke off one of
the plastic outlets the drain hoses connect to when removing.  Luckily the
plastic used is similar to the plastic used in model plane kits.  I have
some liquid glue designed for these and used it to repair the housing.
