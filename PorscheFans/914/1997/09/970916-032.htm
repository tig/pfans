I guess I'll just say this again. "Read the rules, read the rules, and
read the rules.". If you intend on building an engine for a competition
car, and have any intentions of trying for a trophy, build an engine
that is legal for teh class you plan to compete in. The engine mods you
are asking about will most certainly place you into a
"trailer-riding-fire-breathing-monster-car" category. Once the engine
has been built, it's pretty expensive to undo mods like that.

A good thing, but also a major engine mod and my not be legal in a
street car class.
