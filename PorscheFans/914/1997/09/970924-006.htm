Don't worry... it's really pretty easy.  Just undo the two nuts for each
cylinder on one side, squeeze the assemblies together and pull them out.
As you do so, just gently pry the retaining spring down and out of the
way, and you're done.  Slide a couple of drill bits (or other narrow
straight things) through the stud holes to keep them together, and label
each cylinder with a piece of tape.  For the push rod tubes, I just grab
a pair of vice grips, wrap a towel around the push rod tube, gently
clamp the vice grips on, and tug backwards.  Doesn't damage the tubes,
and they pop right out.  I use a piston circlip pliers to tug the old
seals off, but I'm sure you can find something better.  Reassembly is
the opposite, but just remember to use new Viton seals, and give them a
slight coating of oil to prevent pinching and ease installation.

Good luck!
