<< Would I be able to make a sway bar?  If not WHY NOT?  The reason I ask
is because I saw an ad in Excellence for 4130 (chromoly steel) tubular sway
bars for the 914...then I could buy the Weltmeister end-links and be ahead
of the game...  >>

Brett, you'll need more than just the end links.  I would start with
buying a used stock front bar.  You'll need the cups to hold the bushings,
the triangular reinforcing plates, u-tabs for the a-arms, and of course the
"lever arms" and drop-links.

If you had the stock bar to start with, you would be able to make a fatter
one much easier than if you were to re-invent the whole thing, with nothing
to measure from.  You won't need a tubing bender, because the front bar is
straight, with clamp-on lever arms.

Wow, you've just made me think!!!  I'm gonna get some material, whip up a
3/4" (19mm) bar, buy some weltmeister poly bushings, and replace my 15mm
front bar.  I think I'm probably going to have to make or buy some
adjustible lever arms though..
