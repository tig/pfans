          I brought this up a while ago and got a great volume of
          information and after sifting thru it all and driving a
          couple of converted cars I have some new questions. The goal
          in my mind is to get the best meaning most power that will
          not demolish the 901. I drove a 2.2S in a 914 with the 901
          and it felt great and a lot faster than my 4. I then drove a
          3.2 with a 915 and it was awsome at first, but I started
          going aroung corners and shifting a lot and it sucked. Maybe
          it was the conversion, but I have driven 911 SC they were
          not much better. So with this in mind a stock FI 3.0 engine
          or a stock 2.4S engine were my choices for the swap. I am
          thinking that the 2.4 might be less likely to demolish the
          tranny so I lean that way, but the modern reliability of the
          3.0 SC motor is tempting. Also are there any trices to
          beefing up the 901 tranny to handle a 3.0
