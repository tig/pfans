Porsche Fans:
I am having a problem with my 1976 914 2.0 ltr. It is a problem with 
the fuel injection. The fuel injection is stock.
The engine was flooding and throwing raw gas out the tail pipe 
when  I attempted to start the engine.
I have replaced the temp sensor II on the head. I have checked out 
the temp sensor and it shows 2500 ohms cold. I have also replaced the 
pressure sensor. I checked out the pressure sensor and pins 7 & 15 is 
100 ohms, pins 8 & 15 are 350 ohms. I tried blowing into the sensor 
to test the diaphragm and it held a vacuum.
I checked the pressure regulator and the pressure is 29 psi. 
I am going to change the oil and replace the oil filter, In case gas 
got into the oil. Is there any thing else I should checkout before I 
attempt to start the car. It has been setting in the garage for 4 or 
5 days. I charged the battery yesterday. I have also found a place 
that will sale New Bosch Pressure sensors 74 thru 76 2.0 ltr (Part 
Number  028.010.0043) for $250.00, 73 2.0 ltr  (Part Number 
028.010.0037) for $189.00, 70 thru 73 1.7 (Part Number 028.010.0049) 
for $205.00. These prices do not reflect sales tax. I think if you 
are from out of state you don't have to pay sales tax. The name of 
the place is AutoVice in Lynnwood WA. Their telephone number is (425) 
771-6411.
Thanks
