	Not uncommon.  Not real great on a fresh engine, but not completely
unexpected.  Check the cooling flaps, fan (blades missing?) sheet metal,
etc., to make sure your cooling system is up to snuff.

	That's the right connections.  It may be that you have a break in
the signal wire between the sensor and the gauge.  Check for 12 V on the +
line, check for connectivity with ground on the ground wire.  Then check
connectivity of the sensor wire between the sensor and the gauge.  If the
wire is intact, then you either have a dead gauge, a dead sensor, or the
two are not calibrated to each other.  I hope it's the wire.

	Good luck!
