Jim,
Perhaps more appropriate for street car if one anticpates air injection
might need to be reinstalled someday (heaven forbid), I left the tubes
installed in the head and got some brass (?) plumbing caps from the
hardware store which screwed nicely onto the ends. Pretty subtle and
the remainder is not in the way.

JJ,
Finally received my new MPS - it's beautiful. Although I still don't
know if it's safe to install without the decel valve. Does anyone know
for certain?

I also received my new trigger contacts - don't know whether to just
look at them for a while or install.

FYI - To my delight, the Bosch Blue Super Coil I bought from Paragon
Products ($20.16) is the same size as the original and fits the original
bracket! Came with a note from Jason indicating the coil has the capacitor
(to protect ignition components from excess voltage). Thanks Jason!
