	I am quite tempted to say, "If ya gotta ask..."  But it is quite
a bit more complicated than that.

	I would like to think that I've been fairly unlucky with my car.
Mine spent over a year and a half with the motor mostly out of the car.
One full rebuild and two top-ends later, it has had its share of troubles.
For a loooooong time, the car probably would have been in the shop every
fortnight.  It takes even longer, though, because I do the work.  Many
times I do the work two or three or four times, because I screw it up the
first (and second and third and...) time through.
	I recently took my ignition system apart for a whole week.  I
was working very long and ugly hours, and didn't have time to keep messing
with the system until it worked right.  Apart from that, the car has been
running pretty much non-stop for about five months.  I had some troubles
when Smog check time came around, but it turned out those were due to my
ignition system problems.
	I have put more than four times the purchase price into keeping
this car running over the past four-five years.  Probably much more.  At
times I wish that this car would be as reliable as my CRX, but sometimes
I am very happy that I've gotten to know how the world looks from inside
the engine compartment.

	You could talk to Otto's about buying a totally-restored 914.  Tim
Jones has one, and so far he loves it (correct me if I'm wrong, please!).
You'll pay top dollar for a car like that ($7K or maybe more!) but if there
are no other major expenses, it is probably well worth it.

	I think my experience has been happier than Dirk's, overall.  I
haven't run into very much of the NARP ("Not A Real Porsche") attitude, and
I have been able to find most of the VW parts for VW prices.  There are
still a lot of Porsche parts on the car, though.
	Autocrossing the car is a total blast.  I'm nowhere near TToD, I'm
not anywhere near that good a driver and the car is bone-stock.  But the
fun factor is incredible.

	Basically, if you can find a "good" 914, regular maintenance is
about all you'll have to do.  But those seem to be very very rare.  All 914s
are 20-26 years old, and most have been abused (for the reasons Dirk said).
	So, do you still want a 914?
