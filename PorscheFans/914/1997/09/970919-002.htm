O.K., I know everyone is getting sick of my continuous posts asking for
help, and my lack of posts offering help, but look at this way: if I can
get this problem resolved, I will have tinkered with and/or replaced at
least 90 percent of the FI components on my 914, and should be able to
help just about anyone with future problems.

I took the car for a spin last night, and got a better feel for what's
happening.  While idling, then engine hunts so bad that I need to nearly
remove the idle screw to keep it from dying.  Also, it will occasionally
emit little backfires, but only while idling or at really low RPMs.
These are the only problems, though.  When I step on it, it takes off
like a rocket and I have to try really hard to keep it under 4000 RPM
(still breaking in the motor).  I figure that's there HAS to be a
correlation between the hunting and backfiring... I could swear I
remember someone suffering a similar ailment earlier...

Here's the clues:  I had adjusted my MPS perfectly, and had the car
running (and idling) like a champ just last week.  When I took it for an
emissions test, the MPS crapped out.  Inspection revealed that the thin
copper diaphragm had been soldered (poorly) several times in the past,
and had opened up three cracks.  When the MPS failed, the car bucked
terribly in all conditions and was running way rich.  The new MPS solved
the bucking and stumbling, but now I've got this hunting and backfiring.

I'm assuming that the mechanic fixed all of the vacuum leaks (I can't
find any), and the exhaust appears to be on tight (like I said, it
wasn't backfiring before).  I think I've checked everything...  I don't
know what to do next!

Please Help!

Thanks for everyone's assistance (and patience!),

Thank you to everyone who helped with the blinking warning light.  I was able to 
get the light to stop by removing the wire from the brake switch on the master 
cylinder.  Reconnect the wire, blinking returns.  So the switch on the master 
cylinder is clearly the problem.  I was unable to get the switch to reset.  Any 
ideas (other than leaving the wire disconnected!!)?

Thanks,

To: 914@PorscheFans.com

Last October Dion Dunn posed a question about how to plug the holes in the head 
left behind if you remove the air pump and fittings (I have a '75 2.0L).  I 
can't find any follow up postings.  Anyone have any ideas?  Smog legal is not an 
issue, this is a track car, and here in MN they don't check.
