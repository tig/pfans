Sam:

Dave is correct, as usual, but he should have emphasized one of the
words in his reply a little more... Something like this:

                     H   H   AAA   V   V  EEEEE
                     H   H  A   A  V   V  E
                     HHHHH  AAAAA  V   V  EEE
                     H   H  A   A   V V   E
    Note that you'll H   H  A   A    V    EEEEE to do something
    about replicating the curved surface where the original lug
    bolts fit into the curved recesses in the wheels.

Think about what happens if you just use bolts with flat heads (or 
use curved washers that aren't shaped EXACTLY right):  All the 
compressive force that's normally distributed over the -- What...  
1/2-square inch or so? -- of the lug-bolt-to-wheel mating surface 
will be concentrated on a VERY tiny surface of essentially ZERO area.

This WILL crack your wheels, which may kill you.

Look at it this way, if it helps:  You might be able to find cheap,
ill-fitting bolts for $3 apiece.  With the money you save, you'll be
able to buy one tire (maybe), 6 CDs, or half a dozen tankfuls of
gasoline.  Do you really need those things badly enough to risk your
life for them?

PLEASE buy the right bolts.  If you're completely strapped for cash, 
I'll even lend you the money.
