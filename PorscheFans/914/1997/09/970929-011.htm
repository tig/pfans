I am getting my '72 together; this has been a lloonngg time project car. 
I too am having the flashing brake light warning light, but hadn't 
addressed it yet (down on the list).  I just reviewed the string from 
ealier in the month, but it doesn't help my sit'.

The light is flashing w/ ignition on, car on or off.  The e-brake switch 
is not in the car, so that circut is open.  The low fluid sensor on my 
master has one pole, the car has too wires; anyways, I have disconnected 
them so the circut is open.  If it matters, the seatbelt warning system 
has been disconnected and there is no relay under the passenger 
seat....The warning light still blinks.

The Hayes manual (I am looking at the '74 diagrams just because they are 
easier to read) looks like there is a relay in the circut, possibly at 
the light or integrated into the light.  Does anyone have any info 
on this?

I do have an extra set of tri-gauges from a '75 that I would like to use 
in the car which I could test this with, but I will need to take 
everything apart.  The '75 gauges have a 150 speedo.

Different related question:  The '75 gauges don't have identical 
electical connections.  I know the '75 has the smog light; what are the 
other differences?

Thanks in advance
Steve
