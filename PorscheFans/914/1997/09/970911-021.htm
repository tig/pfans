Spacers for the front eh? Is this for fitment over the rotors? I can't
imagine why a 911 wheel wouldn't fit over the stock 914 rotors without a
spacer.

Not knowing what size wheels you have, I can only guess you have fuchs
windmills. Offset is not generally used to describe wheels for many cars
(P-cars included), what is used is the backspacing. Fuchs (five lug)
will have a 125mm (4 7/8 in) backspace. And depending on wheel width,
you might be able to squeeze a 225/50-15 in there. But chances are that
a 205 is about it.

BTW, just forgot to mention one thing from my previous note. My 225s are
_not_ mounted on the factory 914 Fuchs. But the backspacing is crucial
when you try to squeeze fatter tires under the stock fenders. The proper
backspacing should be about 5 inches.
