So, does the decel valve really help prolong life of the MPS?
(Now I'm hesitant to install the new MPS without a decel valve.)

A) If so, does anyone have a known good used decel valve for sale?

Also, I did Knell's injector test this weekend while waiting on the
new MPS & fuel pressure guage (I know, you really need to measure
fuel pressure first ... but I can't just sit and look at it!).

All vials contained equal amounts of fuel, so I guess the injectors
are ok; with respect to one another anyway. One injector leaked a
little fuel on the leak test (fuel pump on without cranking). But
the plug on that cylinder doesn't show rich so I guess it's okay.
All of the small injector seals showed signs of minor cracking
and hardness so they got replaced. This would be a good thing to
check every few thousand miles.

B) Can the cold start injector be tested for leakage in the same manner
(ie. fuel pump on [cold engine] without cranking)?

C) Also, I noticed the ground wire from the Compufire pickup has some
insulation rubbed off (1/8" wire exposed), although the wire itself
looks okay - how bad is this? (?!)

Thanks,
