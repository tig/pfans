Thought I'd let the list know that my 914 is alive and running well once 
again.
The Relays were good as well as the fuel pump.  It seems that the problem 
was a very dirty ground connection in the engine bay ( the one with the 
three spade lugs mounted on the rear of the housing for theFI harness)  I 
chrged up the battery (since I just wore it down from cranking) and cleaned 
up the ground real good.  My beast fired up imediately at the first turn of 
the key and puurred at a nice idle.  The moral here is there is no 
substitute for a good visual inspection and clean GROUND contacts.  Thanks 
to those who helped me out.
