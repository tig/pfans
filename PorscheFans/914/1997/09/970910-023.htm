	Caterpillar has a (reportedly) truly amazing assortment of
metric hardware/fasteners.  If you live out near farm country, try
stopping by and asking what they have available.  Note that you'll
have to do something about replicating the curved surface where the
original lug bolts fit into the curved recesses in the wheels.  I
think that there are washers available somewhere that are close.
	Also, try GPR or PartsHeaven for the repro bolts.  I got
some of those a number of years ago for $7 each--which still isn't
cheap.
	Used may be an option, try the above places plus any local
wreckers you can find.  Remember, the lugs for alloy wheels are
longer than those for steelies.

	UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you use the VW Bug-oriented
screw-in stud kit.  My 1.8's DPO installed one, and the rears did
not have enough thread to safely engage the lug nuts.  And one of
the fronts pulled out, stripping the hole in the hub.  (No, I didn't
overtorque it.)  Not exactly the highest quality...
