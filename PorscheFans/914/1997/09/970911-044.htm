Can't say I have. However, in asking this list you have asked the right
folks. Ok, so I'm gonna ask the main question. How much are you willing
to spend? This is crucial, as buying a 20 year old sports car will incur
many expenses beyond the initial purchase price. Unless of course you're
filthy rich and can afford to buy a proffessionally restored 914. Alot
of the essential information can be found on the 914 FAQ at tims 914
page. "http://www.estinc.com/porsche/".

First question: Best year and motor? 1973 2.0L without question. Next
best would be a 1974 2.0L. After that it becomes a toss up between the
later 1.8s, 2.0s, and earlier 1.7s. It also depends on what you want the
car for. Don't worry about a fast car, without a serious green ($)
infusion, they are not powerful cars. The advantage is that once they do
get up to speed, you don't need to slow down for the turns. "What!? Me
brake?". You will not a find a better handling car out of the box for
the money _anywhere_. Even twice or three times the money.

There are alot of gotchas to look out for in buying a 914. I would
recomend getting in touch with a fellow P-fan in the area or a PCA
member down there. Don't expect to just go out and find an ideal example
right away. You'll need to be patient.

The main gotcha is rust. All 914 have rust, they came off the boat with
rust (you think I'm kidding?). The trick is to find a 914 that has only
minimal rust.

I you find yourself heading up north to the Denver area, I'd be more
than happy to give you a guided tour of a 914. I don't know of anybody
offhand that's down there, but if you contact the Porsche Club of
America, they can certainly point you in a good direction.
 
The main thing to look for for a good car that'll scare your passengers,
you really want a '73 2.0l or a '74 2.0 with the sport option. The '73
came fully loaded, so all the goodies came with it. By goodies I mean
the Fuchs allow wheels (neccessary if you want to fit wider tires under
the fenders), and front and rear swaybars.

The '75 and later cars were equiped with smog equipment and were
detrimental to power delivery. The pre '73 cars (1.7L) were equiped with
the "tail-shifter" transmission that is very sloppy and has been given
the name 'butter-churn'. Also pre '73 had poorer window winder
mechanisms and a non-adjustable passenger seat. The '75+ cars also had
heavier 5mph bumpers. The '73 2.0L is by far the best of the four
cylinder versions. If you have the money to get a 914-6, DO IT! They
handle every bit as well as the rest of teh pack and have a far better
power plant. The original sixes had the 2.0L porsche flat-6 engine.
There are a great many six conversion out there, more than were
originally made probably. Some are done right, some wrong. It's often a
risky proposition to buy someone elses conversion project unless you
know the car really well.

I could go on and on, but read the FAQ. If there are any more questions
(and there will be) you know how to find us. :)

Good luck, and keep us updated on your search.
