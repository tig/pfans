It became clear to me that I'm addicted to 914s yesterday when my
brand-new Manifold Pressure Sensor arrived.  We're talking about a $230
Bosch fuel injection component, but to me, it was a thing of beauty.
Not only did it posses the magical possibility of fixing my car, but it
was truly nice to look at (for me).  There's no oil or grime on it...
just shinny metal.  The black electrical plug is really black, and the
wire numbers are clearly visible.  The epoxy plug was smooth and intact,
as well as the rivets holding the two halves together.  They even put a
little plastic plug on the vacuum intake.  Yikes!  It's just a car part!


(This is where the message gets a little long as I update you on my
condition, and plead for your help)

O.K., so without hesitation, I installed it, hooked everything back up,
and started the car.  It roared to life and idled at a nice 2000 rpm.
This is O.K., because when it was running really rich, it wanted to die
after warming up, so I had to increase the idle just to finish the
emissions test, and I just haven't turned it back down yet.  As with
every moment of joy, it was short lived.  The first thing I noticed was
that the exhaust was spiting out small black particles mixed with the
usual cold exhaust moisture.  I didn't get to concerned, since the last
time I drove it, it was obscenely rich, so it's probably just spitting
out the carbon deposits (right?).  As the car warmed up, the idle began
to drop (I assume because the Aux. Air valve was closing).  Then, it
started to hunt, about 10 seconds between each "up-and-down".  I took it
for a spin, and was satisfied to see that when I open it up, it runs
like a champ.  It stumbles a little when at idle, or while maintaining a
constant RPM, and I did notice it backfire a few times.  No visible
emissions, though.  I've got a new throttle body, a new throttle
position switch, and a new head-temp sensor.  The sensor in the plenum
checked out, and the Aux. Air valve is working.  The plugs and cables
are new, but the spark plugs may have a little carbon build up.  The
grounds have been thoroughly cleaned, and all suspicious connectors have
been replaced.  Just before my last MPS failed, I had adjusted it to the
point where the car ran perfect in all situations, so unless my TPS is
failing erratically, I don't think I can blame it for the stumbling.
Should I just haul it into the shop to see where the mixture is, or is
there some other stuff to check that I've missed?  Is it time to swap in
a different computer?

Thanks again for everyone's help!!!
