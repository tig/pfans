Thanks from me also to DD.  I busted mine 10 years ago by resetting the
tripometer while in motion.  From experience, Dave warns of not letting
the rollers get loose.  From experience *I* warn of not bending the shaft
while driving it back through the rollers (I did manage to straighten it
out enough).
Think seriously before using a dab of glue.  I didn't use glue and my
roughened shaft gripped the gear just fine.  It gripped so strongly that
it took me a long time to push the shaft back in all the way. Glue would
proabably have caused a lot of trouble here.

That got me thinking, the Pennzoil/Gumout "Steam Premium" brand of engine
cleaner has a particularly pleasant odor in contrast to the other products
I've tried (Gunk smells like petroleum for instance).  After tackling the
oil in the exchanger sources of smell, cleaning of the engine compartment
with this stuff should make the heater intake air smell good.  When I get
brave enough to blast a garden hose into my engine compartment I'll share
my results.

Also stock heat exchangers are probably rusty in all these cars.  I know
mine are a little crunchy and mine's a California Car! :)  Just bought
myself one of those $3 CO detector films to see if brain maiming levels of
CO are present in my cockpit.  Only the spectre of death or dementia will
scare me into

parting with SS heat exchanger money!

More likely that they'll have to order.  No doubt they'll be hand
delivered by courier straight from the Fatherland to the dealer and will
cost $1000 each. :)
