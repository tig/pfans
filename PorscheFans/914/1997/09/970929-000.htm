Bill,
Thanks for the advice. I did get the timing problem resolved, as
you suggest, by starting at the beginning. It was self-induced.
In summary, 

a. After careful inspection, I find that I do indeed have a 1.7/2.0
   impeller, not a 1.8 as previously thought!
   There is a red mark 1 blade right of a reinforcement bar (27 deg.)
   There is not a 0 degree mark that I can see (and I looked hard).
   
b. As mentioned, it was lean-hunting and would only idle with timing
   well advanced. I re-installed the 500 ohm resistor in the CHT lead
   (removed when new MPS installed thinking it was no longer needed).
   After all, it was there originally to richen the mixture. This
   cured the lean hunt problem and it began idling normally. I could
   then set timing right on the mark. It's running well now.
   But, I don't understand why the resistor is needed if the MPS is
   new and the CHT sensor resistance is within spec (hot and cold).

Guess I know just enough to be dangerous.

Thanks,
Alan    76 914 2.0
