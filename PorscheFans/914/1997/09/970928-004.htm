Hi everybody!  I wanted to ask a question for all of the long term 914 owners
out there.  I am considering buying a 1973 2.0 liter 914.  My question is:
 How well have your 914s held up as daily drivers and how often have you had
to work on them (aside from normal maintenance)?  I'm planning on driving
about 90 miles 4 days a week to work and back.
     I used to have a 1972 1.7 liter 914.  It needed an engine rebuild when I
got it.  After paying $2500 for an engine rebuild, it lasted about 6 months
(only running about 1/3 to 1/2 of the time) before it died for good.  I
wasn't able to get it fixed properly after that, and it ended up in a
junkyard for parts.
     I loved that car, and I would really like to have another one, but with
my past experience, I'm extremely hesitant to get another one.  I've heard
that the 1.7 liter had a lot of problems, and that 2.0 liters are much
better, but I would like to hear from some of you.  I'm also considering an
early 1970s 911 and a late 70s/early 80s 928 (I love Porsches), but I haven't
had any experience with any of these to compare.  Any advice?  Thanks in
Advance.
