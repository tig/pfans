First, ever try catching up on two weeks worth of "Porschefans" in one
sitting. Very tough. Wish I were inon  the used parts thread.
A couple of help issues:
My 914 has had untold number of DPO's and I really don't know what is rig=
ht
and wrong in the car. It is a fine, fun car, but I want more.
1. There is a Puralator fuel pump mounted to the side wall in the engine
compartment on the passenger side. Obviously, not stock. It feeds a singl=
e
progressive 2 barrel carb.(Can any one tell me how to easily  ID the carb=

manufacturer?)
The pump makes the usual clicking noises as soon as the ignition is turne=
d.
Normal, Right??
However, it does not seem to have any pressure feedback sensor about it a=
nd
will click forever, engine running or not. My MGB pump has the good sense=

to stop when it has filled the pipeline. =

Should I be looking to add/find something under the lid to prevent this?
2. I have yet to fill the gas tank because the PO never filled it, becaus=
e
he was told not to fill it by his PO. It seems when it is half full, I
smell gas when going through turns at moderate (legal) speeds. The smell
definately goes away as it approaches empty. =

Are these two elements related and causing the odor?? or is it my
imagination!
3. On the tire size issue, I have the standard 'pressed' wheels that are
now shod with No Name 195/65 15's. Since I am going to worry about the
fundamentals first, what would be the best tire (size and gription) i can=

get away with?
I have a worry that I am  driving the next Saturn missile to outer space
and would like to fix all that ails my toy.
Went to a PCA AutoX last weekend to watch, That seems like a ton of fun a=
nd
a real chance to' break what ain't broke'. Can't wait until spring when i=
t
starts again. Teeners are very impressive against the Goliaths.
BTW, a belated thanks to all for the help offered a month ago on my first=

round of queries.
