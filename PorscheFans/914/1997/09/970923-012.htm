O.K., this is something I might be able to help out on.  I've had to do
top-end rebuilds twice in the last 18 months, so I'm chalking up a
little experience.  All of my cloth hoses ended up leaking, so I just
made a quick stop at the hardware store and bought some fuel line of a
similar diameter, and several hose clamps.  So far, it appears to be
working great.  I've only needed to replace one section of my fuel line,
and I got that from a friend who worked at a local P-Car shop.  It was
Mercedes Benz line, but it worked perfect.  I would imagine that there
are some good sources out there.  I didn't re-torque my case bolts...
maybe I should have.  Oh well, just one more thing to worry about!
Don't hesitate to ask if you've got any more questions.
