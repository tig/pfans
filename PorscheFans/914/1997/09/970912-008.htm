 Mike,

    I have read (no personal experience) about Mark Stephens =
Performance.  He's down in Tahachapi.  I have read two articles, one in =
Hot VW and one in European Car about Mark's expertise.  He's one of the =
few folks around that specializes in the Type IV engine and Hot VW raves =
about his head work.  I would be skeptical of a local mechanic declaring =
your head "junk".  I'm sure you've priced a new one by now.  And I =
wouldn't let other than an expert repair a hurt head.  Key element of =
the 2.0.

Does anybody have personal experience with MSP?
