<< I've been told by a friend who has never restored a 914, but is very good
 at completely doing Austin Healy's (sp?), that I can do all my body work
 and rocker (and other frame stuff) replacements (I've got the dreaded flex)
 with just a single 110 amp MIG welder. I am still taking welding classes,
 so I do not know yet if this might be true or not. From what little I know
 so far, I think this 110 would not quite be big enough.

Hi, I've had a 110V Sears Craftsman MIG for about the last 8-9 years
and have used it for many repairs and restorations of 914's & 911's
with no problem at all.  It has the heat settings so you can change it
based on the thickness of the metal etc.  It is good up to 3/16
of an inch, so for most of the usual sheet metal you come across it works
just fine.  It is made by Century, and has a tweco nozzle etc, and I have
been able to get all the consumable parts at any local welding supply
place.  It has been very reliable and trouble free.

I also recently bought a Plasma cutter from Daytona MIG and am happy
with the quality/price from them.  You may try them for the Pocket MIG
110V,  if it works as well as the plasma you'll be fine.

Good Luck,
