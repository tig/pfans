Actually, there is a certain sense of security on a bike, or a sport
bike at least. I know that I can out accelerate and out brake just about
anything on the road. The accelerate part is the most important, that is
how you get out of a bad spot. I will go for the gas 9 times out of 10
if I find myself in a potentially difficult situation. A bike, and a car
(914s to be specific) are gennerally alot more stable under acceleration
than under braking. Unfortunately (IMHO) most american drivers treat the
brakes as a safety blanket and will jump on the brakes at the first sign
of trouble. Boy that's irritating. I mean geez, it's only a pedestrian!

I used to go by the motto that I was invisible on the road (lowered 914
the same color as the road). But have sinced revised that to one of the
belief that everyone out there is deliberately trying to kill me. Sure
kept me out of scrapes when I was on my bike. The only times my 914 has
been hit has been when it was sitting all by its lonesome in a parking
lot. THREE TIMES IN ONE YEAR!!!! And no, those 5mph bumpers wouldn't
have done squat, not when the offending vehicles (trucks) had bumpers
that are as high as the window sill.
