This list is great! I've enjoyed all the comments over the last month, and
was even able to get some help of my own. Thank you.

I've been told by a friend who has never restored a 914, but is very good
at completely doing Austin Healy's (sp?), that I can do all my body work
and rocker (and other frame stuff) replacements (I've got the dreaded flex)
with just a single 110 amp MIG welder. I am still taking welding classes,
so I do not know yet if this might be true or not. From what little I know
so far, I think this 110 would not quite be big enough.

I would love to hear from some of you "expert" welders who have done this
chassis repair and what kind of welder(s) work best for the size steel used
on this car. I plan on buying a welder based on the comments I get here.

Thanks.

Steve
