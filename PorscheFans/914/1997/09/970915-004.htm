I have a Metric Mechanic catalog, one of the few that the company had left.
Metric Mechanic is a BMW tuner. Thier catalog is a gold mine of information.
Anyway, what does this have to do with 914's? Well, they have some charts
about engine life vs. engine use and rpm's that I thought would be
interesting to share for the 914 group. 

For autocrossing, the engine life expectancey is 5-7 hours, which is
equivalent to 150-200 miles. If the engine is used only for autocrossing,
expect 2 seasons at most out of the motor.

For driver schools and improved touring, the expectnacy is is about 75
hours, equivalent to about 4500 miles. 

For engine life based on sustained rpm's, they provide the following chart:

9,000rpm - 1 hour
8,000rpm - 4 hours
7,000rpm - 15 hours
6,000rpm - 75 hours
5,000rpm - 500 hours (30,000mi)
4,000rpm - 2,000 hours (90,000mi)
3,000rpm - 3,500 hours (157,500mi)
2,000rpm - 5,000 hours (225,000mi)

Of course, since we have pushrod engines, I think you could discount
everything above 6,000rpm (huh!). Also, aircooled engines run hotter, so
there would be a reduction based on that factor of an unknown amount. This
also assumes you never run low on oil, etc.
