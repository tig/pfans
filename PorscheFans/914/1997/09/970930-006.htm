The problem is the diode in the circuit.  It's encased in what looks
like an in-line fuse holder.  The diode allows the same flasher
module to be used for the turn signals.

The '74 and '72 are _very_ different in this area.  Use the
correct diagram.  ('74 was the year they switched to single
dash indicator for turn signals.)
