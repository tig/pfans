I'd say you can probably wring out a solid 180HP for all of about 10
hours of engine life. More if you willing to get _really_ radical. But
I'm getting ahead of myself here.

Question #1:  What is your application? Usable street motor? Competition
in some class for track or autocross? Reliable daily driver? This is
very important, for the application will dictate both cost and
longevity. If you're looking for more power out of your street car then
the age old addage applies. "Speed is just a matter of money. How fast
can you afford to go?". And truer words were never spoken. Place a
realistic ceiling on how much you are going to spend on a motor, and how
long you want it to last. There is no such thing as a free lunch here,
power will cost money and will reduce engine life, how much so depends
on what is done.

That asside, I'm going to assume that you don't have very particular
smog laws where you live. Cases, not much different between the cases,
they're all Type IV. P&C sets? All depends on what you intend to do. A
set of euro P&Cs doesn't cost much more than a new set of stock P&Cs.
But then again, a big bore kit doesn't cost too much more either. 

If you're going to keep the stock FI, or are building for a stock
competition class, then you really have limited choices in cams, or
anything else for that matter. All power tweaks asside, the best -stock-
motor would be '73 2.0. And you need to find the right sources for the
cam. A '73 2.0 _is_ different from the other grinds that were available.
Durration is pretty much the same, but the lift and profile are slightly
different from the later year cams.

>  Any suggestions?

Let's get a little more specific about what you want and we can from
there.
