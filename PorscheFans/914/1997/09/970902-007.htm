     Hi Dave,
     
     
       I like your plans for a modern system.  Why not go the whole 9 yards 
     and do a true engine management system.  Any system that does not 
     "listen" to knock, and adjust the timing accordingly is a whole 
     generation back in time.  My 914 with the Bosch - D is of course the 
     crudest attempt at electronic fuel injection ever put into a 
     production car.  The engine management system on my '96 Ford Mustang 
     GT SOHC 4.6L is the most modern however.  
     
        A very important feature to include in the system is feedback on 
     knock.  If each cylinder has a knock system, and its' own coil, it 
     gets the optimum spark for the situation ALL the time.  My Mustang is 
     "smart" enough to "Know" what the Octane level of the fuel I'm feeding 
     it is.  When I punch it, I senses the acceleration of the throttle, 
     and moves to maximum allowable advance on the timing.  If knock is 
     detected, it simply backs off a bit until knock stops.  This 
     "adaptability"  is the slickest system around.  It allows mods to 
     valve size, cam timing, supercharger/turbocharger/nitrous power adders 
     and fuel additives etc.  
        
        ADAPTABILITY will be crucial to the VW/Porsche Type IV most 
     critically because knock means guaranteed valve breakage.  A knock 
     sensor at each cylinder coupled with an ECU controlled ignition 
     lighting a spark from 4 individual coils would be the ticket.  The 
     distributor and F.I. points would of course be tossed.  A nice feature 
     might be to utilize twin throttle bodies.  One made to order and 
     probably adaptable would be the throttle body used on Suzuki's now 
     1000cc V-Twin.  Two of these would dramatically decrease the system 
     resistance to air flow into the engine, and they would have much more 
     flow capacity than the 2.0 liter Type IV could use.  If you eliminate 
     the Manifold Pressure Approach, and instead use true Mass Flow 
     Measurement, you've just (re)created a true Motronic System.  On that 
     note, the late model Volve 240s ('93) have 2.3 liter engines with 
     Motronic Engine Management.  It might simply be much easier to take 
     that system from the Junkyard, and adapt it to the Type IV.  This 
     system is fully developed and ADAPTABLE. The biggest challenge would 
     be locating knock sensors in meaningful positions on the cylinder 
     heads, and creating plumbing the bring it all together.  Oil 
     temperature could be monitored instead of water temp.,  Crank position 
     would of course need to be monitored as well.
     
     
     Good Ideas I hope.
     
     Good Luck
