Well congrats on getting another 'teener back on the road! Aren't they
fun?

Had you had any bump steer before storage? How was it stored? It could
be a number of things, but before we get into a big guessing game, I'd
say give the front end a thorough once over. Check the tires for flat
spots, check teh shocks for response, inspect the bushings for wear or
tears, check the steering rack for excessive play, get your alignmnet
checked too, but that's not likely to change if the car was well stored.

Could be a CV, but I'd say it was more likely to be a tranny mount. Do
you have stock mounts or the Poly mounts? Either way, a broken or loose
mount will result in a clunk under initial acceleration. Sounds almost
like something heavy in the rear trunk? Also look at your shift lever
when you accelerate, if there's a tranny mount problem you'll probably
see the lever move by itself. BTDT again, and again, and again...

I'd suspect something near the back end of the exhaust system. If you
had a loose exhaust nut near the heads, you'd probably hear a ticking
and getting the occasional backfire too. But a 914, even with a stock
muffler is not terribly quiet.

Big grin on your face when you got back huh? :)
