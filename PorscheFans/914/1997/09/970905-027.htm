   Try another coil... check the primary resistance of the one you
have...   I don't have a value for the resistance of a known good
coil, but I will try to get a measurement from mine in the next few
days if you don't have a spare to check against.
   A shorted turn or two on the primary side would decrease the
inductance enough to cause excessive surge current through the
points, leading to their early demise.  
   As far as I can tell, the 914 does not use a ballast resistor; if
it did, this would also be a likely candidate (shorted or shorted
start contacts on the ignition switch)... however, I don't believe
this circuitry is present in 914's; if I'm wrong, check this out
also.
