If it is  from a 74 L-jet 1.8, you will have only one relay on the board.
 L-jet drives the fuel pump from the combo relay over on the battery tray
support.

Now for the rest of the ills, what is not working?  

1) Check ignition system completely.
2) Check fuel pressure.
3) Check the rest of the fuel injection.

Take Care,
