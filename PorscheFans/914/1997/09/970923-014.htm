	As Dirk said, they just slide on.  The hose clamps aren't necessary,
but I decided to use some just in case.  Sort of belt-and-suspenders approach.
If yours are leaking, you can get new ones for relatively little $$.

	If you want to.

	Get something rated for 50+ PSI gasoline.  Your hoses shouldn't
see that kind of pressure unless something is wrong, but safety margin
is good.  Many people recommend the German-made hose specifically.
	Several people also recommended that I find some of the original-
type hose clamps.  Evidently they are designed to not cut into the hose,
and in theory will help it last a little longer.  Most hardware-store
clamps tend to cut up the hoses a bit, which can be a problem at 40+ PSI.
	I'd like to plug GPR here yet again.  They can get you the intake
runner boots and the fuel hose, as well as just about anything else you
need for your Type IV.  Their prices are good, their service is excellent.
