way too rich. head temp sensor wiring needs to be checked. as well as your
grounds...

One more thing... the only thing I haven't done yet

I just undo the connection, clean all surfaces up real good, and reinstall. 

If I determine that they need cleaning, will a wire

yeah, and maybe a little 100grit sand paper

Other than the tranny ground

there's a ground connection that's a little hidden away on the driver's side
in the engine bay. it's down low where the firewall and the side bulkhead
meet. you'll find several brown wires coming out of the harness and bolted
to a stud there. 

on the engine, there's a ground connector for the fuel injection harness.
it's held on by one of the case bolts on top, to the rear of the intake plenum.
