That's right, they fire in pairs. You're getting closer grasshopper.
Let's see if you find it. ;)...

Well, you're really, really close. But I'll see if this can get you the
rest of the way...

#1 and #4 are lean, probably excessively so. #2 and #3 are rich,
probably excessively so. My guess is that injectors #1 and #4 are not
firing, or are only firing intermittently. And it's possible that #2 and
#3 were somehow setup to compensate for the other two. More likely the
whole thing's running rich, and #1 and #4 simply aren't getting the fuel
they're requesting.

Where is the problem? I can't say for sure, but I'd hazzard a guess (and
pint or two of beer) that it's the FI points. Either the points
themselves, unlikely but possible, or the connector for the FI points.
There are three wires that connect to the FI points, two hot (1&4, and
2&3) and one common ground. I had the ground wire break inside the
connector jacket once and pounded my head as to why I could smell gas
when I was trying to start the engine but it never actually started.
Turns out, I had fuel from the cold-start valve, but that wasn't enough
to actually fire the engine. The injectors were simply not firing.

I may not be right, and I may be wrong (have been so before), but it
doesn't sound like there's much left that hasn't been replaced.
