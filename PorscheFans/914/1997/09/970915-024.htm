 Any ideas?

   I checked the Haynes book, and can't find the master cylinder
differential pressure warning switch either, but that doesn't mean
that it isn't there.   There were a lot of variants of these cars,
and if yours is an early production '75, then it may have the master
cylinder warning switch fitted, as the '74's did.

   If so, then it is necessary to pull the left front wheel, reach in
the hole above the steering rack, and find the switch sticking out
the side of the master cylinder (if present).   If it's there, next
to where the two wires connect, there is a tiny rubber boot.  
Pressing in on the end of this boot resets the switch.  As you are an
M.D., I presume you know how to treat Black-Widow spider bite...
always a possibility when reaching into long-undisturbed body
cavities on the 914!   :-)

   If this is not the problem, or the switch is not present, then
check the parking brake warning switch.   This is located in the
crossmember bulge that runs transversely under the seats.   It is
located in a hole in the member directly below the hand  brake lever,
and is de-actuated by the lever when it is in the fully released
position.   If the switch has been damaged, or if the brake lever
does not release fully, then the warning light will continue to
flash.

					Good Luck,
                                                            Jim T.
