	The engine compartment of our '70 single cab VW pickup was sandblasted..
sand is STILL fall out of the nooks and crannies. LOTS of sand. I blew it
clean and wiped it down before painting ALL of it- significantly, the sand
that's falling out ISN'T trapped under any paint :(  I wouldn't recomend 
sandblasting under a unibody after this experience. Anything you can see
ALL of, go ahead. But folded sheet metal, nooks and crannies, no.

	Anyway, sandblasting is not the optimum way to remove undercoating,
since undercoating is soft and sticky. A chisel or putty knife and a hot
air gun would be a good place to start. Use a respirator.

	I missed the beginning of the Blue coil/points thread- is the
afflicted person changing capacitors every time they change points? The
capacitor is there to prevent the points from burning up. The distributor
in my '71 1.7 was such a PITA that I did new points once without changing
the capacitor... and about a year later the points welded. Running one
second, stopped dead the next second. Just my $0.02

	YMMV
