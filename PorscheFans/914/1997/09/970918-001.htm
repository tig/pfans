 Another question.  Is it just me or do most all Porsche owners not
really

on.

(snip from a reply)
But I don't think I'm the "typical" used porsche owner. I'm a fanatic,
and a gear head. _AND_, I went into it with my eyes open, I knew it
would be expensive to maintain and restore.

WAKE UP CALL GUYS!!!!

The people on these groups (including myself) are not typical or even
normal.  The typical driver from my observations is the PPPP type (push
pedal, point and pray). Normal people do not derive enjoyment from
scarfing knuckles, getting dirty, having grease under their nails, or
poping open the hood just to see what is going on.  Normal people could
care less or even understand, if their car is having just a slight bit
of understear, if their camber should be 1 degree more..shoot most could
not put in a quart of oil if their lifes depended on it.  Most peoples
cars are a way to get from one point to another or are trophys, or
status items, or are all they can afford, but for what ever reason they
are still PPPP'ers.  What ever car they drive wether it be a Porsche, a
SUV, a cadilac, they drive the car the same, usually terribly with no
clue of what is going on.  They tailgate, use inappropriate speed,
mirrors are for checking their hairdo, turn signals are illegal, stop
signs are optional, etc.

The group of people on this mail list are very atypical.  Autos are
meant to be driven, and driven well.  Great enjoyment is derived from
our cars responding perfectly to our inputs.  We hear or feel things=20
happening and make corrections or fix them before they get out of hand.=20
We are the kind that keep old classics alive as a passion.  The best
drivers I see  behind the wheel regardless if it is a SUV, ATV, or
pick-up, are owners of 15 to 20 year old Porsches that are loved and
understood for what they are=85fine pieces of machinery that have to be
respected and taken care of.  Many of us have gotten our beasts from
people that do not take care of their cars. Thats the only way I could
of afforded my initial 911.  But with eyes open I knew the investment I
would have to make down the line to bring the old lady up to snuff=85
thank god for those idiots that drove my 911, 914, MG Midget, 280Z, the
money I would have spent on a shrink went into these lovely creatures
and kept me sane at the same time (just don't ask my wife for
confirmation of that last point).

We do not need to trash other drivers, or the gold chain set.  I just
shake my head and feel sorry for them.  If that is normal I don't want
to go there.  We do not need to flame them just pity them.

Thanks for the soap box.
Sorry for the length.  BTW I'm much better now
