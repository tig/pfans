I think I'll give it a shot... nothing to loose, right?  This failure
had to have occurred right as I started my car at that "euro-car-hating"
shop when testing my CO.  I had checked the MPS on several occasions,
and had been able to hold vacuum and measured a perfect 90 and 350
between the pins.  I'm trying to figure out what could cause the
spontaneous failure of the MPS, though.  I'm running Total Seal piston
rings, and I thought I remembered reading that the vacuum caused by
their "superior" sealing rings can cause strange behavior... do you
think this is what they were talking about?

BTW:  If anyone's got a good used MPS that passes the usual tests for
sale, let me know!

Thanks again,
