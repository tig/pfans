Good, then you can ascertain for yourself and snow them 'cause they
don't know diddly. :) But if the serial number on the windshield starts
with 473xxxx and it has a GAxxxx engine number, it's pretty likely it's
a '73 2.0

You're just gonna have to investigate the cars yourself.

O.k. So what, more leg room. I don't think the center console is really
worth going out of your way for. And the lack therof is a further
bargaining point. Especially since that would mean either their car has
been stripped down, or they're missrepresenting it. All '73 2.0s (model
year) had both sport and appearance options, that includes sway bars,
fucks, chrome, fog lights, center console, and a few other things.

Look for a GAxxxx serial number just in front of the oil filler cap
embossed on the engine case.

So you've got someone who throws money at their car without knowing too
much about the car itself. So what, it's not as if people like that
don't exist. We're a minority in the car world, we actually _want_ to
know what an oil galley plug is. The good thing is that Otto's is a
great shop. There are a handfull of _real_ 914 gurus out there in the
US, and Otto is one of 'em. If the car has been maintained by Otto, call
him up and ask about it. Tell him what you want to do with the car
(competition) and see if he recomends your buying the car. He's a good
source for knowledge and information.

To alot of people it's simply a car. A sporty car, that makes one look
good, but just a car nonetheless. What percentage of 911 SC owners do
you think have _ever_ been to an autox or track event. A mighty small
one to be sure.

Well, you're a gearhead, makes sense to me. But you'd be supprised how
some people will go out of their way to _not_ learn about cars. One
friend of mine (name witheld to protect the stupid) thought that the oil
warning light was just a reminder to get the oil changed. 500 miles
later spelled the death of a great early 70's Land Rover. Amazing it
lasted that long, but it was a brit car and as such was probably used to
going without oil for a while. ;)
 
> Boy... I really need a 914...

Yes you do. And build that sucker up to full Street Prepared specs and
come on out and play with the rest of us SCCA kids. :)
 
Go check out those cars. Never stop looking untill you actually put the
money down. Same principle with job searching (I'm doing that right
now), don't stop looking untill you actually accept an offer.
