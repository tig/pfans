1. Pauter Machine here in Chula Vista, CA at least used to make roller
bearinged billet rocker arms for the type IV engine, I guess Dirk was
looking into producing these.
2. Use silicone (I use a GE tube) on the viton seals for the pushrod
tubes.
3. I have looked at the specs of the 73-74 2.0 injectors vs. the 75-76
injectors with my father and have found no differences. The 73-74
injectors are cheaper, by the way. Anyone have any inside information on
these?
4. What the hell have I done to my car? On my '76 with a '74 D-Jetronic
2.0 GA series engine I'm idling at 3200 rpm. I tried to set the timing
right to remedy the idling at 1600-1800 rpm. I had to fix a couple of
electrical connections, most notably the wire to the sensor underneath
the manifold close to the distributor. I can get the idle to a sensible
level by retarding the timing but I get the overheating blues. I put my
hand over the throttle body and the idle drops like 1500 rpm but... and
my aux. air valve is not defective. This car once ran well, but that was
before I tried to set everything properly. The one thing I'm neglecting
is my dwell angle, though I set the gap before puuting in the
distributor. How profoundly does this affect everything?
