The 2.5 and 2.7 were available from the factory in race models. I don't
know about the 2.8 but I would guess that it too was a factory race
engine. Notice that there are different minimum weights for the three.
These were just this year moved into AP from FP. FP has been disbanded
completely.

That's a very good point. I'd say if you can build the /6 conversion to
factory race specs, then you're fine. 
 
The Prepared rules are really quite forgiving. I personally don't see a
problem with it, but your best bet would be to write a letter the SEB.
