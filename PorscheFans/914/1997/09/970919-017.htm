Hi Steve,
     I had some trouble sending this to PorscheFans, so I will send it to
you
     directly.  Feel free to post it if you think it is useful.

     I guess I am sort of an expert since I used to make a living by
welding
     in my college years.  I have a light 120V, 130 amp  MIG welder which
is
     more than enough for chassis repair.  It happens to be a PowerMig but
     many of them are similar.  It will do 3/16 in a single pass.  You may
     have to wire a high amp circuit to use it on the high amp setting,
     however, to avoid tripping the breaker.  The critical part of the MIG,

     in my opinion, is the feed mechanism.  It must be able to feed the
wire
     at an even speed.  Check out the sturdiness of the wire feed mechanism

     if you can.  Most of the 110V models use a plastic frame with steel
     drive and idler.  Continuous (infinite) variability of wire feed rates

     is absolutely essential.  You will be adjusting this frequently and
just
     a little change makes difference.  Get one with at least four heat
     settings.  More settings (or continuous adjustment) are better, if it
is
     within your budget.  If you buy a smaller machine a short cable is not

     problem, since you just move the welder near the work.  The welder
     should be able to handle 0.24" to 0.35" wire.  For this type of work
you
     want true MIG machine that uses a CO2/argon gas.  The "Gas Free MIGs"
     use a flux core wire which leave a slag on the bead which you have to
     chip off later.  They produce more smoke and smell as well.  A MIG
will
     leave a clean bead that requires little or no cleanup.

     Your alternative is a large heavy machine that requires 220V, is very
     hard to move around, and costs much more.  One advantage of the 110V
     machines is that you can take it over to a friends place or to the
track
     with you.

     Make sure you can get parts for the welder.  This is the advantage of
     buying a major name.  The tips need to be replaced every once in a
     while.  When you are pricing machines, be sure to ask what is
included.
     Some do not come with a regulator, for example. You will also have to
     buy or rent a gas bottle.  The welding "helmet" included with these
     units is completely inadequate for anything other than looking at an
     solar eclipse.  You will probably want a helmet with a flip-up window
so
     you can peek at the workpiece without lifting the helmet.  The lens
     should be a #10 or higher.  You may want to try a gold coated lens
     instead of a colored glass lens.  You can see your welding better with

     these.   The newer electronic autodarkening lenses are terrific (they
     are clear until you strike the arc, then they turn dark automatically)

     but prices start at about $130.

     Hope this helps.
