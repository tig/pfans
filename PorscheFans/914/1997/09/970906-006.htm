Guys,
Andy Warren is right.  You CANNOT repro the factory manuals. Period.  Why
do you suppose they sell for $350 (or whatever it is they cost)?  It is
because Porsche has retained all rights to this material. Can we say
"Supply and Demand" ?

If you want cheap, get the fiche versions and a used fiche reader.  the
color wiring diagrams can be had from more than one source around here.  I
managed to buy mine separately.  I STILL don't own the full set of 914
manuals, just bits and pieces. This is a bit ironic, as I've full factory
manuals for everything else I own; the 3/4ton Dodge, the Civic SI, the
Porsche 912, and even my '36 Cord :)

Bottom Line: don't do this full repro...you WILL hear from PCNA (and no,
I'm not gonna squeal..). They're just very good at protecting what is
theirs.  No, I'm not (yet) a legal pro either...I am in my second year of
Law School however.

Cheers
