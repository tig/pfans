Rick,
What a great story !  A testament to the robust design of our 914's.  I't 
just too bad all of our stories could't end the same way as yours.  

By the way I have fixed my oil leaks by simply cleaning up the engine and 
turning the pushrod tubes a half a turn to reseat the o-rings.  The loud 
exhaust noise was from loose nuts holding the heat exhangers.  Tightening 
them up made a big differnece though I may need to replace the copper 
o-rings.  

The more I work on this car the more I realize "it's not rocket science", it 
realy starts to get quite easy (untill the next big disaster).

I love my car ! (when it runs)

>>My 74 914 1.8 had been unused for 6 years.  I had a reliable car to
drive everyday and the tangerine 914, my first car, was shooting gas
geisers 6 feet in the air and mom's garage was empty (she was at work :) )...
....

.......Car passed smog today at 4pm and I squeaked into the AAA office just
before 5PM, got my new plates and registration tags.  A week ago this car
had a dead battery, flat tires, and was spraying fuel all over the engine
compartment (after swapping in a working battery to operate the fuel
pump). .........
