You won't like this, but...

I, too, found it impossible to remove the outer CV Joints from the stub
axle.  I wound up towing the car to a Porsche shop to have removed.  Costs
about $150.  They had a mongo impact wrench to remove the castellated nut.
They then drove out the stub axle and separated the CV from the stub axle
flange.  Then the stub axles were remounted and torqued to spec.  I then
towed the car home and finished replacing the joints.  (If you have this
done, remember to ask the shop to clean up the old gasket material from the
stub axle flange before reinstalling).  Be sure to ask that wheel bearings
are inspected and/or replaced.

I tried for about a week to remove it myself.  I made tools out of old
screwdrivers to try to pry the CV from the flange (heated the tip and bent
at 90 degrees). They just broke and the CV would not budge.  I've read that
others have found this to be impossible, too.

Of course I had to re-bolt the inner CV joint to the tranny so the car
could be towed.  On one of the outer CV joints, the balls fell out and I
was able to remove the half axle/CV inner hub, leaving the outer CV piece
stuck to the flange.

Remember to replace the old CV bolts and install new lock washers, new
gaskets too.  Torque to 31ft/lbs.  Recheck torque after a while of driving
(you probably knew all that).

All this because the Haynes manual says to relube CVs every 30,000 miles,
and I noticed a light clicking on taking off from a stop.  Actually was
good though, one outer CV had 3 of 4 bolts way loose, grease everywhere,
probably causing the noise.  (This was the CV that I couldn't get unstuck).

Subject: various
I have had the pleasure of breaking the inner Cv on a friend of mine's 914.
Now I can't separate the inner joint from the flange.  Unfortunately the
car is at his house away from the air power so I believe it will be next to
impossible to remove the outer flange bolt (250ftlbs). Any Suggestions?
I also have access to a real glass to for the 914.  What is the demand for
such an item.  Also what would it go for if it is in good condition.  Are
the replica 916 bumpers sold by various firms quality or are they mostly
junk.  I may end up replacing the chrome numbers on my 73.
What problems will I be looking at if I install hard plastic, or delrin
bushings in the rear trailing arms. Other than squeaks.
