I'll be adding a 11"x11" (48-row) oil cooler and would like some input from 
those who've already done the same.

1. Where's the least expensive place to get hose (Pegasus @ $3.99/foot?)?

2. Are standard stainless steel clamps over barbs sufficient?  (Note I didn't 
say best or classy.)

3. The hardware store guy asked why I wanted to use brass fittings (1/2" NPT 
to 1/2" barb) rather than the lighter white nylon/plastic ones - I need over 
two pounds of fittings!  Would nylon/plastic melt or fail to seal?

3a. I use Teflon tape on brass fittings - do you also use it on nylon/plastic 
fittings?

4. What is the thread on the sandwich adapter for 914s?  18x1.5mm?  3/4x16?
13/16x16?

5. The oil thermostat comes without a mounting kit - what works best?  I'm 
thinking two flat angle brackets to capture the flange against the bottom of 
the rear trunk (so the t'stat will hang down which seems to be the way it 
would work best).

Thanks in advance,
