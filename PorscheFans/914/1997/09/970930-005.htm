Well I refuse to be appointed for Guru status, once achieved there is
nowhere else to go.

Anyway the skinny is as follows.

Get the newest Porsche you can afford for you money.  You are easily in
the 911SC price range, and if you look you will find a 911 Carrera or
maybe even a well used 993.  If it is a 911 you are looking for please do
yourself a favor and buy at least two books.

1) Bruce Anderson's 911 Performance handbook

2)The DYI 911 restoration and purchase manual, it is british, but very
well put together and covers all the ins and outs on what to look for in
a used 911.

I personnely would avoid the following as a daily driver Porsche the 928,
yes a great car but repairs are astronomical and most examples are not
well taken care of.  The 924-931(924 Turbo) the 944 line including the
turbo.  For the same reasons as above.  The 968 maybe a choice since they
are still relatively new, but will still need repair work.  And since you
don't want to do it yourself, these things tend to have a repair cost of
$1000, as a standard quote.

The 356 is in your price range, but not daily driver material.

The 914 is a great choice, but does require some maintenance, but is less
expensive.

So that basically leaves  the 911 as a dependable, good daily driver
choice.  And again avoid the turbo models which tend to be more
maintenance intensive than say a regular 911.  Any 911SC or newer is a
great choice.  I would go for a standard mileage model.  See Porsche are
made to be driven, they actually do not fair well being a garage potato. 
Much like you would not fair well being parked in one spot for 12 months
only to get driven one weekend and then sat back in the corner.

You must realize a Porsche does not require more maintenance, but things
will cost more than your Datsuns or MGs.  After an oil change alone on a
911 will require an extra 6-8 quarts of oil, and the proper filter cost
more also.  So every 3000-5000 miles you are buying a case of oil instead
of 4 quarts.  Things will break if neglected also, I don't want to chance
you off, but it is all just observations.

Also note:  The 944-968 and 928s are great cars, the do all what a good
Porsche does, but due to there low market value currently you will find
more junk than good cars.  This is also true of the 914, but the ratio is
even greater of bad cars per good car.

But then if you want a truly reliable sports car buy a Honda CRX, fun
with appliance like utility.

For the other information look for FAQ files I can also forward Bruce
Anderson's buying tips for the 911/912, 914, 924-968, and 928 off of
Compuserve if you wish.
