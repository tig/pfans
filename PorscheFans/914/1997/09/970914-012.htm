Good I am not alone.

No you are the first to suggest this one.

A tiptronic or PDK would also do this, and you have the nice capablity in
some units to preselect the gears.

Well I can see only one reason.  Torque!!! or lack there of.  Bike
engines work well in there given applications or in shifter carts.  But
see a Bike might tip the scale at 500# at most.  And then with driver
figure another 200#s so we have 700#s so a free revving engine will and
does work.  Okay the 914 on a really good day can weigh in at 1800# only
know of one and yours probably is more like 2200#s, and with  the driver 
the total is 2400#s.  Now, sure the 914 will get off the line, but you
will be passed by guys in a hippie caravan of VW transporters with 36hp
engines.  

See it does not have the torque to push all the weight.  This is the
reason stock cars keep the revs allot lower than your typical F1 car. 
Mass takes Force to move.  And the more MASS you have the more Torque you
will need to get it moving.  HP only keeps it moving, torque is what gets
it there, and dettermines how fast it does get there.

Look at it this way, you can push your motorcycle with realative ease,
you may even push it all the wat to the gas station if it runs out of
gas.  A 914 is a lot harder to get rolling, and the hunk of american iron
is even worse,  But you will not catch me pushing my 914 to a gas
station, or that piece of american iron.  A gas can is allot less
streeful.  But the motorcycle, all I can say is BTDT.

Neat idea, but I think wrong application.  Now if we are talking about
droppin it in a 700# Elva sypder or a shifter-cart.  Sounds like fun! 
Where do I sign up.

Take care,
