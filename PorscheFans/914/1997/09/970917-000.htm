The weak link in the 901 box is the fact that 1st gear and reverse are 
located out behind the intermediate plate, and do not have adequate
support on the very end of the shaft.  This leaves them vulnerable to
being loosened or broken off the end, causing very bad things to happen.
The torque is really the problem in that it stresses 1st gear.  Ask
me - I'm on my 2nd tranny for my sixer with a 3.2 in it.  

Many people still use the 901 box, and it is very reliable for the most 
part.  Considering the cost and weight advantages of the 901, it is worth
having to baby 1st gear, you or someone else may feel differently, but I had 
5 years of track events on the last tranny, got another one for $250.
 rebuilt
it and put a quaife in it and it has lasted two years so far - and is looking
good.
To go to a 915 box is far more expensive.
