Okay I think maybe I need to clarify something.  My rambleings are for
entertainment, do not base your possible 914 ownership off of one of my
stories.  They are losely based on the truth.

The fact that I said all repair procedures start with droping the engine
is well a joke.  I am sure it has crossed peoples minds, but I do the
majority of my 914 work with the engine in the car.  Only a major itewm
would cause me to drop an engine.  And no I don't have the hands of a 2
year old with the dexterity of a brain surgen.  I got stuck with the big
bear claws, I have learned to function with them, but I need to train my
son or daughter on how to turn that nut daddy can't get to.

A 914 can and most of the times will be a perfectly reliable car.  The
biggest ill is the injection system, because most people did not take the
time to keep it working corectly, or junked it in favor of carbs.  Things
happen wires break, but D-jet is a much easier system to grasp than say
L-jet, which was and still is the orginal idea that evoled into Motronic.


 And I will go this far and say most 914 ills are electrical related. 
Face it, stuff corrodes over time.  In the computer industry it was
standard fair to unplu and replug connectors and have things magicly
start to work. This was main-frame days, now on new cars the connectors
have gotten better at keeping things clean. And the PC industry evolves
so fast we don't have a chance to see how long it takes for items to
corrode. Look at GM connectors for example, they have gaskets on them,
they are pretty well water tight where they need be.  Connectors got
better cars have become more relaible.  But there is no reason a 914
can't compete, they can, and do. 

And because I or others may have a problem does not mean every body will.
 Like for example I am ditching my L-Jet injection. Not really because I
have to, it is more because I want to.  Sure I need a new air flow meter
and at $150-$300, I have chosen to invest that money in an aftermarket
unit.  I know I am not the norm, nor do I wish to be.  I have a specific
set of items I need inorder to do what I want to with the car (auto-x PCA
I-1 and SCCA DP)  So in both I am allowed to run aftermarket EFI, and to
be competitive I need to.  It is a choice, just like the big brakes, wide
wheels, flares (future mod) and other items are a choice.  And yes I
spend alot more time than most on/in/under my 914, but that is waht
happens when you buy a 914 kit car.  So many things to check and or
reinstall.  But in the next couple of weeks, my 914 will be back to
driver status and then it will be a reliable form of transportation.
