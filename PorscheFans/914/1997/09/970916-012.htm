Two very likely candidates. One, you're low on oil. Two, you're running
a light weight oil. This'll happen when the oil gets really hot and
thin, the pressure drops below the ~7psi trip point for the oil light.
There's still pressure, it's just very low. Bring the revs up to 2k and
teh light should go out. this happens to my car when I pull off the
track after a number of hot laps. The best thing you can do is to drive
slowly and keep the engine running so you can cool the engine down while
still circulating the oil.
