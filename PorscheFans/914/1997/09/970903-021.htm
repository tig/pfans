First of all, thanks to everyone who responded.  It looks like the A509s are the 
favorite...

This is a weekend driver in So Cal., dry=yes, life=relatively short ok, speedometer=???.
I am planning on 195/60/15s but am intriqued by the 195/50s though they probably aren't 
necessary for my needs.  I do currently have Riveras to clearance is a concern but the 
195s will fit.  The car has either been lowered or is sagging...this will not be changed 
anytime soon.

Before a recent PC rebuild, someone had a chart of tire size vs. % change.  If someone 
could e-mail it to me I would appreciate...
