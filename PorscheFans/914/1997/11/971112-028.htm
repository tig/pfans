The two designations that are most comonly refered to are 12A and 13B.
'12' and '13' being displacement designators, and 'A' and 'B' being
generation designators (I believe). 1200cc and 1300cc rotary engines.
The reason why they aren't mentioned in your book are that 12A and 13B
are Mazda designations for their engines that were found in the early
RX's.

Geez, I've had those piston-less motors on my brain havn't I? What was
in my 914 again? ;)

For those interested, and OB 914 content, the new suspension will be
going in this month. 

21mm hollow torsion bars (Thanks Jeff!)
22mm front sway bar (Thanks Jason!)
200lb rear coils (Thanks again Jason!)
and solid bushings in all of the remaining rubber bushing locations.

All that running on 225 R1s at all four corners.
