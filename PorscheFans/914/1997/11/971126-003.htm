The way I had the Getrag (I've also heard it called a "Dog-Leg"...)
pattern explained to me was this:  When racing, the most important shift
is back and forth between 3rd and 2nd, and this pattern makes that shift
straight up and down, as opposed to the "H" pattern, which requires you
to go up, over, and up again.  Made sense to me...
