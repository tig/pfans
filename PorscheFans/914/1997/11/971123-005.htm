Bzzz, yes they do really exist.

Details a 74 model added the following items.

Actually in three flavors, welcome to 914robins, may I help you.

Most noticeable difference is:
 new front spoiler thus named "limited edition spoiler" it along with the
following where all painted.  Bumpers, valances, rocker panels, and the
Mahle wheel centers.  These where painted yellow with a black exterior,
or green or orange for a white exterior.  I don't think they had pilar
vinyl, and all I have seen had the rest of the 73 appearance group items.
(which where optional on all other 74 2.0 liters.)

Book that somewhat covers them:
914&914-6 restores guide to authenticity by Dr. B. Johnson, ISBN:
0-929758-01-3

Unfortunately the Limited edition cars are not covered by most 914 books,
we will see if the new one does anything better, but Das Grossen and
Caught by camera don't even mention them.  But then they where an
American only item.

Are they worth more, no not really just about the same as a 73-74 2.0l
with all the trimmings.  The biggest problem I see with them is there is
no current documentation to prove your car may or may not have been a
limited edition car.  All it has to be is a 74 white or black and doctor
it up from there.  If I was to do won I would go for the green on white,
very rare model, I have only seen one.  The black yellow combo is by far
the most popular, followed by the white orange.

Take care,
