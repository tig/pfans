Chuck,

I already have a neat 914 with good brakes and suspension. I autocross it
in CSP in SCCA. It has polyurethane bushings all around, Weltmeister
adjustable swaybars front and rear (rears are disconnected) and 140lb
springs on adjustable spring perches on the rear and Koni shocks all
around. I've had this car for 12 years so it is my baby.

I know that everyone hacks up the front trunk for the radiator on the
rotary conversions. The reason I was asking about the amount of engine
bay room was to ascertain if dual radiators could be fitted in there. I'd
have nice thermostat fans on those radiators and a nice open engine cover
to allow as much air as possible in there. You see I kind of like both my
trunks. Helps on all those long hoses that need to be routed through or
around the driver's compartment.

What did you do for an exhaust system? Are you running a 13-B or 12-A?
Stock or street ported? What is a good source for engines? Did you use
the crown conversion or another one? (as you can see I'm full of
questions).

Ben
