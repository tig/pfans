	Talk to JJ about MSHP, he had them fix this very problem on
one of his heads.
	I've had both of my heads do the *EXACT* same thing--an intake
seat in both cases.   8^(    According to the machine shop where I went,
this is not that common (!!?!?!!)--supposedly the exhast seats drop more
frequently due to all the heat and cracking.  (I'm not sure I trust their
advice any more; they are no longer my machinists for lots of reasons...)
	What they did was to pull the valve seats (the first time, it was
the one dropped intake and all four exhaust; the second, all four intake).
Then they cut out all of the cracked areas, and built the material back
up by welding.  Then they cut new bores for the seats, and did the heat/
chill/press thing to put new seats in.  Then a valve job, because you
can't count on the seats being perfectly-positioned after all that
welding.
	For the most part, the heads seem to have held up OK for the 10K
miles since then.

	Someone on the list recently had a problem with some MSHP heads;
they and Rich Johnson talked to MSHP and (as far as I know) got every-
thing resolved to everyone's satisfaction.
