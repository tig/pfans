I've found that it's probably better off to just get a new set of steel
wheels made. It won't cost much more, and you'll have a better set of
wheels too.

Are there track requirements in your stock class? I was not under the
impression that there were. There may be wheel width and backspacing
restrictions however. Find out what exactly your rules dictate -before-
spending any money.

That's a toughie, on 7" wheels with maybe 5-1/4 backspacing and a
baseball bat, they may fit. I'm running 225/50-14 tires on 6 inch rims
under stock fenders and only run on the inner fender wall under heavy
lateral loading, which I believe is trailing arm flex. The backspacing
on these wheels is 4-7/8. The 225/50-14 has the same rolling diameter as
the 205/50-15. So all I've given up is crisper turn in from the shorter
sidewall in exchange for noticably increased lateral grip. An exchange I
think I can live with.
