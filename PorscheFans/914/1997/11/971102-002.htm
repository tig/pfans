After reading the couple of replies I got (thanks Jim & Josh!), I decided
to go ahead and look at the car again.  I hooked the battery back up, put
in the key and gave it a turn.  When I noticed an extra click that didn't
seem to be there last night, just about the time when I'd expect the
injection system to do it's thing, I decided to just hook everything back
up to the relay board and see what would happen.  The injection system
primed, but the starter sounded a bit weak.  After ten to fifteen minutes
with the battery on the charger, I tried again and it fired right up.
*And* it seems that my repeated cleanings of that relay board cleared up
my perceived alternator problem!  Woo hoo!
