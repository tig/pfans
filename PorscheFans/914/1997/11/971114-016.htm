(Of course, no one ever said dreams need to be practical or affordable!)

Sure, use some off a mustang II double wishbone like the orginal.

(My dream of dreams is a replica 908-3 with a wicked six cylinder 911 motor
that revs so high that dogs can't hear it.)

My god another, I have always wanted to do one of these.  I was going to use
a slightly different aproach, take two 911 engines graft them togther and
build a 908-8.  But then I guess I could do the same and build a 914-8.

> Um, Stephen, I was talking about fantasies, not castrated comet cultists...

(I agree about the AA 9014 kit.  From the photos in their catalog it just
doesn't quite cut it... especially since a sweetly done flared 914 is so damn
neat.)

Yes true.

(On the "do whatever you want" issue, I take a slightly different tack.  They
made gazillions of 911s, basic 356s and 914s, so go ahead and make your dune
buggy, modified quarter midget, whatever.  They only made a few hundred (?)
550s though, so I think there is a certain logic in seeing that these go to
owners who will preserve them.  Replicas?  Let the games begin!)

Yeah, but I don't see a problem with it he went from a red interior to a tan.
 What's the big deal, it still is a stock 550 interior.

>That's the anal retentetive side of the preservationist attitude.  Red, tan,
who cares?  Now, a chevy small block is another matter altogether   =:^-}
