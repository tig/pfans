Well, I spoke a while back with a couple of 914 guru types, and I did
come accross one possible reason for failed seats. Engine braking below
1800 rpm. Below 1800 rpm, the fuel cuts pretty much out and all you get
is a cold air. Do this often or long enough after the engine is warm,
and you can cool the seat out of the head. I don't know if this is true
or not, but it sounded reasonable to me.
