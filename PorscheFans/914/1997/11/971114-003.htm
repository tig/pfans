After reading the e-mails confirming that my Aux. Air Valve is
definitely hooked up in the wrong place, I went home last night
motivated to tinker.  It was dark, less than 20 degrees out, and I had
to shovel the garage out.  To make matters worse, the battery was dead.
So, I tapped into that inexplicable motivation that we all get when
around out 914s, and began working.  I swapped batteries and let the car
warm up a bit, then took it for a quick spin.  Just so you know, the car
is a '76, and was once equipped with air injectors and a smog pump.  The
small "injectors" have been left in the heads, and capped with brass
caps to prevent any leaks.  As I headed home, the car began to sound
much more like a Beetle, which is what happens when one of those brass
caps comes loose and I'm faced with an exhaust leak in the engine bay.
Well, this time, not only did I have that "Beetle" sound, I also had
about half my normal power.  I puttered home, checked the brass caps
(they were all tight), and disconnected the Aux. Air Valve from the
coil.  I started it up and took it for another spin, and the difference
was like night and day.  No more missing or puttering or backfiring,
just pure power.  It was a sheer joy... for about 5 minutes.  Then, as I
down shifted to 2nd to pass a car in front of me, the car resumed the
"beetle" sound and lost about half of it power.  Once again, I puttered
home and this time I had to park it and swap batteries back, since it
was already starting to snow again.  I really do think that
disconnecting the Aux. Air Valve is making a huge difference... I could
visualize the spark changing from a dim orange thread to a thick white
arc when I disconnected the connection, and the engine seemed to behave
in a manner consistent with my visualization.  I think the other problem
("beetle" sound / half-power) is something else.  If you've stuck with
me this far, here's the two questions for the day:

What happens to the Aux. Air Valve when it's disconnected?  I'm going to
hook it up eventually, but I'm just curious now.

Any ideas as to what could cause the "beetle" sound / half-power
problem?  It's definitely intermittent, for what it's worth...

Thanks again for everyone's help!
