lbs-ft  or lbs*ft).  Lbs/ft or ft/lbs doesn't make sense.

>>>Actually Bernie, you are correct about the mathematical designation
because it is not one item divided by the other (the way I wrote the
abbreviations), it is both items side by side.  And written in long hand,
it is pound-feet, NOT foot-pounds.  So, your designation of lb-ft is
correct.  The description of it being pound-feet instead of foot-pounds
is better left to the true mathematicians on the list.  I could do it if
I had to, but would rather not.  Not being one, I would take up too much
bandwidth to describe it, where a mathematician would tell us with much
more eloquence and brevity, I'm sure :-)  The simplest I can think of is
that it has to do with the technical definition; torque = force applied
at a radius.

>>>Entry level technicians (in the USA) make minimum wage the same as
burger flippers or most other entry level positions which are open to
those who want them today.  In the fast lube industry, there are few
levels between entry level and management.  Management positions are
quite attainable, where I know of folks making from $25,000 to $150,000
per year, depending on geography and demographics.  The same holds true
for general line mechanics and dealership mechanics.  The funny thing to
me is your equation of dollars earned with motivation.  You obviously
don't understand human motivation very well.  My premise still stands, if
YOU don't communicate with your hired server/technician, shame on you,
whether he cares or not.  Point: motivation comes from within, dollars
per hour earned are NOT an indicator of whether someone cares about
working on YOUR car.  As is typical in anything, the extremes CAN be
found.  I know many technicians who are very glad to have a job, AT
minimum wage, and DO care about working on every vehicle they see in a
day.  Likewise, I know of several, like a gent in California, named
Carmen, who was making in excess of the aformentioned $150,000, who blew
it all because he didn't care, and was caught up in an embezzlement &
theft ring (besides his very good wages), and is now behind bars for his
"not-caring" actions.  You don't always pay for what you get, and you
don't always get what you paid for.  YOU must be a good communicator, so
tell them about your 914 drain plug torque setting :-)
