RE: shit (oil strainer bolt overtorque)
Now wait a minute!!
I just last weekend mated with a 2.0 case, and the last
thing on my mind before I buttoned it up was that dumb
windage tray/oil pickup rig.  This is an all-steel structure
that hangs by an eye-bolt located along the case parting
line.  Guess what passes thru that eye-bolt hole?

 -A very long steel bolt that goes from one side of the
case to the other. . .it's probably four inches long and spans
case metal of some thickness with exception to where the
'eye-bolt' occupies between case halves.

Over torquing the strainer bolt might, *might* rip the eyebolt
loose from the top of the oil pickup 'bell' but it wont tear off
the underside of the case. . .the casting is over a quarter inch
thick in the center plus it is spanned 4" by a grade 8 bolt.
On the other end, the bottom of the case, is also fairly thick
aluminium, but I suppose anything is possible. . .paticularly if
you lost the OEM part and replaced it with a steel nut . .

What you all have overlooked (in my humblest of opinions -yet)  :)
 -Is that the oil pickup cover bolt is actually a nut, a capnut
and I think it is made of aluminium. . .Nawww!  You dont
suppose the manual is specifying a low torque to protect
the aluminum capnut do you??  Yes!

kyle is guilty of this emission. . .
