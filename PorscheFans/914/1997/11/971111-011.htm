Well, my car's had been running for a little more than a week, so it was
due for another problem.  I took a mildly-spirited right hand turn, and
*something* happened.  I'm not sure what that something was, but...

	Alternator warning light came on
	Brake lights stopped working
	Radio stopped working (continuous power feed for the clock works,
		but not the power feed for producing noise or displaying
		the frequency)
	Turn signals stopped working
	When brakes are applied, gauges lose power (they all read
		0/low/empty)

	Lights still work, car still runs, and battery doesn't seem to
		get drained.

I'm going to start looking at the Haynes manual to see what since thing
could cause this sort of problem, but if anyone has experienced this
before, I'd appreciate a hint.
