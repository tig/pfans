And what articles said that? The 1.8, is still quite a good car for the
track. It all depends on the class you run in. In road racing it can
still be a good E-porduction racer. It can be a great PCA club car, and
in SCCA autox it can be a potent D-Prepared car.

Ouch. I don't know if you fully realise just how expensive a project
like that would be. First off, as Andy said, the chassis will have to be
lengthened to accomodate it. Certainly NOT a bolt in procedure. Before
you start off in the "914 from hell" direction. First decide what you
intend to do with the car. If you want to race the car in any
competetive manner, then very carefully consider what class you want to
run in and in what club. Read the rules, thoroughly. And THEN, and only
then, decide on what kind of wild mods you want to, and can afford to,
do. 

Personally, I find that big ol' V8s, while awsome godlike torgue
abounds, are not quite right for a little 914. I prefer to keep the
power plant light weight so as to not disrupt the balance of the car. My
_personal_ preference if one _were_ to do a water pumper power plant,
would be a bridge ported 13B rotary motor. Just as much HP as a stock
928 motor (not as much torque, true), linear power band, only weighs
225lbs, and can rev up to 10,000 rpm. <evil grin>. But I'm too much of a
purist and would probably wind up doing a 3.2 or even a 3.6 twin plug
conversion. 

And have you priced how much a fresh 928 motor costs? Yikes! I could buy
a whole 914-6 for that much. And that's _just_ the motor, not including
all of the difficult work that would go into trying to squeeze that
sucker into a 914.
