Don't rule out the possibility that you have the wrong dipstick in
there.  After you filled it the first time, did you check the stick to
see where it was reading?  Also, these engines are very susceptible to
inaccurate readings if the car is not on level ground.  (And ditto to
others' comments about letting the car sit for 10 minutes before
checking the oil to let it all drain back into the pan.)  One final
note:  If you have one of those bolt-on deep sumps hanging off the
engine where the oil screen goes, you'll need more oil to begin with.

Check to make sure your Aux air valve is fully open when it is cold
(you'll have to check this after letting the car sit overnight).  Also,
it is possible that your cold start valve isn't plugged in or isn't
functioning.  Its purpose is to squirt extra gas into the airbox to
provide more fuel flow when the engine is cold.

Check out   http://www.estinc.com/porsche  and choose [TECH REFERENCE],
then choose "Dave Darling's 2.0 hose..."  for a great diagram of the
hoses or choose "D-JETRONIC FI HELP - Kjell Nelin...." for a complete
description of all the FI parts and how to test them.

Personally, I think one of the best references for the engines and the
FI is "How to Keep Your VW Alive" by John Muir.

Good luck.
