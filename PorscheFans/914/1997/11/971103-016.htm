I might be able to offer a little perspective on this one.  I currently
own a '76 914 2.0, and my previous car was - low and behold - an '82
Rx7.  I had driven a friend's 914 one time several years before I even
bought the Rx7, and had wanted one ever since.  I think my Rx7 was a
fluke, though.  I bought the car with 97,000 miles on it for $1000, put
50,000 incredibly hard miles on it, and sold it to a friend who races
his Audi Turbo Quattro Coupe, who has since put another 20,000 even
harder miles on it, and it's still kicking.  The only thing the car has
needed have been a couple of catalytic converters and a new clutch.  On
the other hand, I bought my 914 with 112,000 original miles, only 500 on
the rebuilt engine.  I've since put less than 4,000 easy miles on it.
The car has needed to have the top end of the engine rebuilt twice due
to a dropped valve seat and a mysterious inability of the rings to seat.
Almost every component of the fuel injection has been replaced with new
components, and the car is still sitting in my garage, incapable of
passing emissions.  I know this sounds awful, but I cannot describe in
words how much more fun the 914 has been than the Rx7.  Just like my Rx7
was a fluke (rotary engines have a life expectancy of about 100,000
miles) so is my 914.  You'll find that most of the people on this list
have had much more success than I have.  I've raced my friend around in
the Rx7 several times, and we're usually really close.  I always pull
away in the corners, and when we hit long straights, I'll pull away
again.  He drives the Rx7 much harder than I drive the 914, so he'll
usually drop the clutch and get me off the line, but I can always catch
him.  Basically, if you want to keep it inexpensive and just go racing,
get the Rx7.  If you can spare a little more cash (and/or do the work
yourself) and want to have a LOT of fun racing and driving, get the 914.
