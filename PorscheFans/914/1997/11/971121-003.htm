Yep, a dropped valve seat was the starting point of my long and
frustrating adventure with the D-Jet.  Initially, I had figured that
MSHP would be fairly cheap (I think they quoted $25/seat for
replacement), but I ended up getting the heads completely rebuilt and
repaired.  I think in the end the total bill was about $600, but that
included new seats, valves, guides, inserts on the spark plug holes,
several crack repairs, and one stud boss re-weld.  At this point, I've
got *maybe* 100 miles on them, so I really can't say how well it's
worked out, but everything looked really nice when I bolted them back
on...
