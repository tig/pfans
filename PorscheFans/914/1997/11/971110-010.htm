Since it is an early production number it should be a 1.7L case
originally.  Yes as you said it will have less strength than the latter
aluminum counterpart.  Is a desirable case.  Well Michel, for what you
are doing (installing in a 912) it may be a desirable item.  It could
keep the weight to close that of the original 912 engine.  As far as the
strength goes, well you could dowel(shuttle) pin the case around the
bearings and the outer mounting flanges.  But a type-4 is not know for
bottom end failure.  Or poor engines have problems with heads, but bottom
end failures are all most unheard of. Unless you do something really
dumb, like not torque the rod bolts.

Is it a rare item yes, is it worth a bunch, no not a chance. How much
less does it weigh anyway?????  For use in a large bore engine you will
run into some of the same problems the VW type one case has, bearing
hammering, cracks around the rear main bearings, web failure, and studs
that like to pull out.  But I can still see advantages to a mag case. 
Light weight, if it shave 50-75 pounds off the back end of your 912 it
may well be worth the beefing up to get it to work.   BTW, you be moving
this engine a little deeper into the chassis, by using a type-4, it is 4"
shorter than a type-1, and about the same for a 912/356 engine.  That is
once you remove all the front hardware, and convert to an upright
configuration.

The fire aspect is true, Mag does not stop burning once ignited.  But I
would not worry to much, hey you could have the luck of one of our
locals, whose 914 burnt to the ground at the same spot after running the
same errand.

Take Care,
