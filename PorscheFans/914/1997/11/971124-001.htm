C.K. wanted to know about RHD conversions for the 914. My previous 914
('73 2litre) was a RHD conversion performed by a company in the UK
called CC Classics. Therefore I learnt quite a bit about the job. When
the 914 was originally imported to the UK the conversion was done by
Crayfords and they managed to produce an almost "factory" look which I
think involved a "new" fibreglass dash, but most importantly involved
reshaping the fuel tank which I believe they did by cutting and
rewelding the tank, which resulted in a reduction in tank capacity. The
pedal cluster switch is fairly straightforward as is the steering
column. The car I had was a "prototype" which CC Classics hoped would
lead to stacks of orders from UK based 914 owners. It didn't because of
the cost (they went down the route of cutting and rewelding the dash
into RHD form which is a huge job) and in my opinion because the quality
of the work was not up to the expectations of the average Porsche owner.
I won't go into the details but suffice to say I spent a lot of time and
cash on the car (and CC Classics not suprisingly disappeared I assume
into liquidation). I finally decided to sell the car when I sat in an
original Crayford conversion owned by Ian McMath from Andover in the UK
and on doing so realised that CC Classics had not reshaped the fuel tank
in the same way as Crayfords did, so my driving position , which I had
always taken as being the norm was inferior to that which the factory
had intended. I now have a LHD '74 2:0 litre and I would not consider a
conversion unless it exactly reproduced the factory position which is an
extremely difficult task. I have driven two LHD Porsches ('73 911 and
the 914) on the roads of the UK and find it to be no real problem. Only
time it is difficult is when joining motorways and requires more
swivelling of the neck to see round the pillars. With a performance car
I don't think you can take chances with something as critical as the
driving position and associated equipment, quite apart from the minor
niggles like the factory radio slot not being able to be used on the
"wrong" side of the dash because of the bulkhead shape on the "other"
side etc. 

Sorry for the length of the post but would hate to see you embarking on
an expensive project without knowing the extent and pitfalls of it.  If
you want to chat further please feel free to mail me off list at:
paw@kpgb.q8.co.uk.

Cheers 

Phil.
