For any 'streetable' car. I still sincerely belive that Prepared is the
place for 914s in SCCA Solo2. D-Prepared for the 1.8, and A-Prepared for
the sixes. Yes, in A-prepared you can run almost anything up to a 2.8L
six. The 2.0 four is also in A-prepared, but I don't think it can quite
hack it against the Loti.

As for CSP, the jury's still out. I'm determined to make a 914
competetive in CSP, even if I go broke in the process. All that's really
left now are the big fat wheels and tires ( 15x9 or 15x10 with either
225/50-15 or 245/45-15, say bye bye to stock fenders, say hello to the
sawz-all) and a total powerplant overhaul. The suspension will be done
by the end of the month.
