Hi folks!
I bought a set of poly urethane bushings for the front A-arms a while =
ago.  I went to=20
Otto's in Venice to see howw much it cost to install them.  I had pulled =
the arms off and all they had to do was take the old ones off and put =
the new ones on ...correctly.  They pryed the old ones off and proceeded =
to put the polys on , hammering the crap out of them.  I vaguely =
remember getting an e-mail about how you're supposed to "fit" them to =
each end before installing them.  Are these bushings totally wasted or =
can I salvage them by removing them and trimming them to size?
I have a set of early ('70) and late ('75) struts (along w/ the A-arms =
and the supports).  Can I use the early A-arms w/ a late ball-joint and =
strut set-up?  I read in the AA catalog that early struts can fail as a =
result of "wallowing"!?  Does any one know what this means and what =
causes it?

I'm still in the "learning stage " of 914 tech, I'm glad we have this =
forum to gain some knowledge from experienced 914ers.  Too bad I didn't =
use that kowledge before my bushings were hammered!!
