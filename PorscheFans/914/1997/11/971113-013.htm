I am a new owner of a 1974 914 2 liter.  I have been extremely happy as well
as impressed with the car but there are a couple of problems that I have been
experiencing with my car.

The first and more important is a problem with my oil.  About a month ago I
changed my oil without any problems.  Of course i added the 3.7 quarts or so
that is neccesary for this car.  Anyway, last night while coming to a stop at
a stop sign my oil light flashed on at me and then went off.  I got the car
as soon as I could and upon looking at the dipstick i found that the car had
hardly any oil in it.  The car does leak oil a little bit, but the owner that
i bought it from said this was normal and even hereditary for these cars.
 The drip was certainly not big enough to drop nearly 4 quarts all within the
vicinity of about a month.  Is it normal that these cars burn that much oil
in that short of a time?  Or does it sound like something else may be going
on here?

The second question isn't that big of a deal and Im pretty sure that it is
normal.  Upon starting the car in the morning, it will usually stall if i
dont keep it alive with my foot on the gas.  I noticed this especially to be
so in the rain.  Is this normal and is there anything that can help it run
better cold?  Mind you that this is an original car with the fuel injection.
 

Thanks,
