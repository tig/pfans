I can't say about the numbers, but I do have a passing familiarity with
the 411 engines. The only real problem, and it's a biggie, is the basic
fact that it's made from magnesium. You know what the fire department
did when they encountered a VW 411 with an engine fire? NOTHING. The
problem is that if that magnesium gets too hot, or a fire starts in the
engine bay and ignites the case. It will burn untill there's nothing
left. And there is no way to put it out. I had a friend that would go
out to a beach at night, set a big ol' bonfire, and toss a magnesium
engine case (with a long chain attached) into the fire. Once the
magnesium started to burn he and a few other people would use the chain
to drag the now burning case out of the fire and sling it into the
ocean. It would continue to burn underwater untill there was no
magnesium left. So, are you willing to take that chance to save about a
few pounds?

Yes, the 901 transaxle is also a magnesium alloy, but it is not
subjected to quite the potential heat that an engine can be, namely
engine fires. Don't think that it doesn't occur to me now and then.
