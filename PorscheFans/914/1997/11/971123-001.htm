To add my $0.02, I have those steel wheels now, and autocross with 205/60s
which *just* fit under the rears with the inner lip rolled.  If I recall,
Mike had used spacers on the front with the 205/50s.  I haven't since I
would have to roll out the front fenders to fit the added track.  (I just
don't turn too tightly!)

I think 225s would be too wide a cross section for any 7-inch wheels (for
autocrossing purposes).
