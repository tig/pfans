Jeez, yesterday's post sure was informative. So, 

1. To prevent dropping a seat, how does one know when the valve guides
   are worn?

2. If torque spec on oil strainer bolt is 9 ft-lbs, what is it for the
   drain plug? The spark plugs? (Never founds these in my Haynes.)
   I usually just snug em down, but extra careful with the spark plugs.

3. As per AA Tech Tips, don't forget to lube the hinge point beneath the
   seat rail mount point so it doesn't break (I never knew they moved
   until I did this).

4. If I've had my alternator out and checked, and battery is good, why
   do my headlights have a faint "pulse" (bright/dim) occassionally under
   constant rpm?

Thanks for any info!
Regards,
Alan
Dan, thanks for the description-
