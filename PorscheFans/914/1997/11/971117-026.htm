	I recently had the 914 aligned and corner-balanced.  The shop
(Custom Alignment in Mt. View) got the corner-weights right, and got
the alignment mostly to spec.  Mostly.
	I had requested 1.5 degrees negative camber in the rear (that
is what I am allowed locally in my class).  They were only able to
give me 1.2 degrees on one side, so that is what they set up for both.
I think the limiting side was the right side.
	The car appears to be lowered from stock height, although that
could be entirely due to it wearing 195/50-15 tires instead of stock
height ones.  I am morally certain that it has not been raised up.
The inner mounting point for the right trailing arm appears to be
solid, as does the metal supporting it.  The right-side arm is the one
that was on the car when I bought it, while the left one was replaced
with a factory-new unit about a year ago.  (Don't ask.)
	One more data point:  The spring on the right side was found
to have sagged more than that on the left side.  The cross-weights
would not work out that way, so they swapped springs left-to-right.
	So my question is, what would be causing this camber limit,
and causing it asymmetrically?  I would think that an old arm would
flex or bend in the direction of more negative camber, although I sup-
pose the opposite could be true.
	Thanks for any suggestions!
