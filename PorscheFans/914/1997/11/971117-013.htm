This is very likely you Throttle Position Switch (TPS for short). This
switch is a basically a multiple wiper contact type of switch. THe
'bucking' you experience at a steady cruise is the result of the contact
being scored or excessively worn at the most frequent point of use (just
barely open throttle when cruising). THe contact becomes intermitent and
will be telling the brain (I'm accelerating, no wait, I'm slowing, no
wait.. I'm accelerating, oop, now I'm slowing, Oh, nope, make that
accelerating again...).

There are two ways to remedy this problem. Replace the TPS. Or crack
open the TPS (you'll need to remove the throttle body for this either
way), and clean and relocate the contact arms. What I do is just bend
the contact arm just slightly to use an undamaged (or unused) portion of
the contact on the circuit board.
