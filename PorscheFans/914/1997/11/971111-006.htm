Michel,

The KYB were orginally of very poor build quality, many people had
problems with then.  I have used them on my Karmann Ghia with great
success, and not a problem.  I have a friend that uses them on his 914,
and likes them.  They are much like Bilstiens.  And are very stiff, but I
did like them on my Ghia.

Take Care,

Stephen Jacobs
