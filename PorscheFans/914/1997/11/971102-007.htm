Dirk and All,
    Yer right.  Not enough was said about the bad stuff that can happen.  In
my case I was able to pull the windshield (pre-painter activity) without a
hitch.  I stored it for three months and nobody dropped a hammer on it.  I
put it back in the car with new clips purchased from a Porsche dealer in
Houston and didn't break it.  Way too late, I discovered that the rear-view
mirror was worn out (vibration).  While pulling the old mirror out of the
car...you guessed it. *sigh*
    My buddies were real sympathetic..."it's a piece of glass, nitwit!".

Regards,
DC
