I have no clue about widning steel wheels, but Im not sure I like the sound
of it.  Not being a serious racer though, what do i know. : )  However I do
run a set of 15x7 fuchs on my car with 225/50/15s and with the help of a
baseball bat, I have no problem with clearance.  Though if you are to attempt
the baseball bat treatment, dont do as i did.  Have a friend help you.  The
procedeure requires 2 people and it will crack your paint a little around the
wheel well.
