Does anyone have any tricks to removing the chrome trim around the 
windshield w/o damaging it?  I have a replacement glass and all of the 
install parts from AA.

Steve:  
  There is a special tool made for removing the chrome trim.  The tool
looks like an elongated flat arrowhead.  The tool is slipped under the
chrome trim and slid horizontally untill it catches one of the barbs of
the arrowhead on the back of the clip pulling it away from the chrome
and thus releasing it to be pryed up.  Usually it just pops up at this
point.
Any glass shop should have one of these tools and if they won't let you
borrow it, they could tell you where to get one.  They're cheap.This
will enable you to save your clips for I doubt seriously you will be
able to find new ones.

   Use 3M window ribbon 1/4 inch to reinstall the new glass.  I have
never heard of a rubber seal for this purpose and since there is no
pinch weld to use I would not put much faith in such a product. 
Additionally the glued in windshield makes the windshield frame
stronger.

Good Luck
