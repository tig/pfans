There is a ground bundle in the engine compartment up above the relay board
on the drivers side.  There is one (mainly for the fuel injection stuff) on
the engine case, a 3 prong connector on one of the case bolts, usually on
the top back near the tranny/case line.  There is another main ground point
up under the dash on the drivers side near the fuse panel.

Grounding problems can do weird things.  I just tracked down a problem I
had where the buzzer went off whenever the car was off and the key off.
Turned out to be a problem in the 'Fasten Seat Belt' light of all things.
This is more than just a light, it has a small circuit in it.  The diode
for the light itself was shorted so when the key was off the buzzer was
finding a path to ground through the shorted diode, throught the light,
back through the power wire from the key (powered when key is in and on)
then through the power wires through a relay coil to ground.

I've been through the wiring diagrams so many times chasing gremlins.  I
took apart and cleaned every contact in the car which killed most of them.
Just need to replace that turn signal switch to finish it.  I try and check
my wiring diagram tonight and see if anything could cause the symptoms you
describe.    I'd still suspect a ground problem like others mentioned.

There's zero resistance between the tranny case and the bolt on the
underside of the body where the ground strap attaches.  All the fuses
seem okay.  I get 12V+ between the positive battery terminal and the
tranny case, and 12V+ between the positive battery terminal and the two
ground connections I found up by the headlights.  The fuses all seem to
be seated okay (checked with multimeter).

There are still five wires plugged into each light housing.  I did find
that there's a problem with the left side hazard light - I'll start
running this down tonight, but I doubt that's the source of the main
problem.

I've traced the bundle of wires going to the rear lights up as far as the
engine compartment.  Is there a convenient place to disconnect these
wires so I can see which section of the wiring has the problem?  Also,
according to the wiring diagram, there are 4 ground connections in the
car.  I've found the two up by the headlights, but I haven't noticed
where the other two are hiding yet.  Anyone know where they are?
