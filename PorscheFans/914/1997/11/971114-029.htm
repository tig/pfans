> David, have you been following the thread about the 550 RSK kit cars?

> Since you're there and somewhat connected to Houston happenings, do you

> importers/assemblers of Mr. Beck's very good and famous 550 kit and his
> 356 Cabriolet kit also.  I have their old card in front of me.  Company &

> Dr.,  Woodlands, TX 77386.

> They were great guys, and were a great source for building that kit
