Here is some more information on the wide wheel/tire discussion for the stock
fendered 914s.  My 914 has had 6X16s (911 Fuchs) with 205/55s on all four
corners for years.  I wanted to add 7s in the back with 225/50/16 tires.
 This would increase my rear tire's foot print by 2 inches and look pretty
aggressive.  What I've discovered is most 914s have about 9.5 inches of space
from the inner fender to the outer.  This is a measurement at the fender
lip's inner edge to the inner wheel well.  The widest point of the sidewall
of a 225/50 or 55 tire mounted on a 7 inch wheel is about 9.2 to 9.5 inches.
 I check several brands of tires (Bridgestone, Yoko's, Perelli's, Dunlops)
and they all provide very similar mounted dimensions so I assume there isn't
a tire that would fall in the 9.0 range.  I even looked at a few 225/45s and
215's finding very similar measurements falling into the 9.2 or greater
range.  Bottom line is that the 7X16 inch wheel with a perfect offset would
still need additional fender clearance for safe use with these tires. 
I ended up narrowing my trailing arms and using the 7X16 inch Fuchs with
205/55s.  Hopefully more 215 series 16 inch tires will become available and
their side wall width will come down closer to the 9.0 inch range needed to
fit the car.
One possible combination for those of you running 15 inche wheels would be to
use a 225/50 or 55 series tire on a 6 inche wheel.  With the right brand tire
you could achieve a combination that would provide a 9.0 inch sidewall width
(for every 1 inch of wheel width the tires sidewall will change .2 of an
inch)  That considered, a 6 inch wheel with the correct backspace should
allow the 225s to fit under stock fenders without inner or outer fender
clearance problems. 
Has anyone tried this?
