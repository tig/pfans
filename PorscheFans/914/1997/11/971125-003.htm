Subject: 225s on a 914


I have no clue about widning steel wheels, but Im not sure I like the
sound
of it.  Not being a serious racer though, what do i know. : )  However I
do
run a set of 15x7 fuchs on my car with 225/50/15s and with the help of a
baseball bat, I have no problem with clearance.  Though if you are to
attempt
the baseball bat treatment, dont do as i did.  Have a friend help you. 
The
procedeure requires 2 people and it will crack your paint a little around
the
wheel well.

Talk to me about how you do this ball batting. I assume you put the ball
bat up against the tire and roll the car and let the pressure from the
rolling force push out the lip. I've heard "ball batting" the fenders
mentioned a lot of times but no one has actually explained how to do it.

How do you like the rotary in the 914. I've been thinking about this swap
for a long time. Did you swap it yourself or have someone do it for you.
I'd like info about exhaust systems, front motor mounting and the amount
of room left in the engine bay after the swap.
