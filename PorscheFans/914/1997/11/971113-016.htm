Congrads on your 914 purchase hope it continues to bring you enjoyment.

Okay this is a bad thing for me to do, but from the wording I am thinking
you checked the oil immediately after stopping the car.  Oil will still
be out in the heads and dripping down the engine, so you will get an
inaccurate reading.

Next question have you noticed the light flashing on / off going around a
corner?  If yes then add a little extra like .25 to .5 quart.  The crank
on these engines is up above the oil line so you don't have to worry
about whipping the oil.  Also this is a common practice for our cars to
keep the oil in the sump, well in reality it just gives you a little
extra to put into the heads, before the light comes on.

If by chance the you just turned a long corner (sweeper) and then braked
, you just experienced oil transfer.  The oil likes to move to the
outside of the turn, so it sits out in your cylinder head, via the push
rod tubes.  Note: Our engines are better at retaining the oil than say a
VW type-1, but they are still prone to this behavior.  Top off the engine
with a little extra and see if the problem goes away.

No your engine does not have to leak.  With current seal technology, even
the poor design of the push rod tubes and the o-rings means you can have
a leak free engine.  Yes in the old days it was harder to do, but now you
can do it.  Viton seals are your friend.

Not normal, I would suspect Aux air valve, is clogged or not functioning
correctly.  It is designed to pass air during startup and the seal off
once the engine has warmed up.

Here are a few suggestions to make your 914 ownership even more
enjoyable.

1) Get all the manuals you can find on the 914.  The factory manuals are
available on MicroFiche for a really low price.  I got my 914 manual and
parts manual for less than $25.00 - The fische reader was a Mendelsons
(electronic surplus) buy at $10 bucks. Not bad for good info.  Also don't
forget the 914 specification book. $12.95

2) Get all the catalogs you can find.
	A) Automobile Atlanta
	b) Stoddards
	c) Tweeks
	d) Automotions
	e) Doc and Cy's
	f) Performance Products

3) Order the 700 tech tips from Automobile Atlanta and become your own
expert.  These are a compilation of George Hussey's wisdom, very good
reading.

4) Join the PCA, and then meet people and network with other local 914
owners.

5) Look over the 914 web pages Tim's and Renegades, both have valid tech
tips and articles, Renegades has a huge used part section that is very
active.  Tim's page has the D-jet test procedures.  A must read!  Also
there are a few injection books out and about on the D-jet find the one
that fits your style.

6) Stay on this list someone here has had or experienced your problem.

7) Hopefully someone in your area will have the Upfixing series that you
can look at - they are put out by the Porsche club, and have an
interesting and technical information about all Porsche.

8) You will need a multi meter, an analog unit is good for certain items,
like watching for a circuit that fluctuates.  A digital does not respond
as fast since it samples and then provides the average of the readings
for the sample period.  But a digital is easier to read.  An auto range
DVM is ideal for the novice.

9) Keep your car together as much as possible and drive - Drive - DRIVE! 
A lot of upgrades can be planned for a weekend so get the part together
ask all th questions, do it early in the day and then reap the fruits of
your labor.  Makes 914 ownership much more enjoyable.

Take Care,
