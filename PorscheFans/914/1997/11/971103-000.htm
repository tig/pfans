I was blessed with a brief period on Sunday where the wind died down
enough to actually work on the 914 again for a little while.  Dave
Darling was kind enough to send me a spare ECU to replace mine with in
an attempt to rule it out as the culprit.  After finding the dim orange
spark two weeks ago, I didn't think that the new ECU would solve the
problem, and sure enough, it didn't.  At this point I guess it's just a
matter of pinning down the problem with the ignition system.  I haven't
had a helper around lately, so tinkering with the ignition has been
difficult at best.  Basically, here's what I've got on my "list of
things to try":

1.  Disconnect the Crane Cams electronic unit, and install a set of
points.
2.  Try an old plug wire to see if the spark differs.
3.  Make sure the Coil and the Crane Cams unit are hooked up correctly.
4.  Test the resistance of the coil (should be 3-4 ohms), and test its
spark using Dave's method.

I've never tinkered with points before (I don't even know what they look
like).  Is there detailed instructions in the Haynes manual dealing with
their replacement?  Is there anything else I need other than the points
(condenser, etc.)?  Since I don't have any documentation on the Crane
unit, is there a simple, logical manner in which I could verify that it
is hooked up correctly?  How can I verify that I haven't somehow hooked
it up backwards?

Thanks again for everyone's help!
