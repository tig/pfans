O.K., now you've all got me sufficiently paranoid as well.  My engine is
equipped with the Weltmeister sump plate, which was installed before I
purchased the car.  I've only needed to perform top-end work, so I'm not
really familiar with the engine's bottom end.  The sump plate attaches
with what initially appears to be a large bolt (the head is too big for
any of my sockets... I'd guess it's about 21mm), but once you remove the
bolt, you see that it's more like a hollow bolt, with no threads on the
outside, but threaded on the inside.  Does this make sense?  Now, I
occasionally get leaks from this sump plate, even with new gaskets and a
little "Gask-a-cinch", so I've tightened it up pretty good.  Since I
have to use a wrench, I really don't know what the torque setting is,
but I'd guess it's about 15 lbs.  Have I screwed myself, or does having
the sump plate offer me a little more protection?

Thanks,

J.J. Slowik
