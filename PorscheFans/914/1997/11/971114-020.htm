Hey, why not graft and splice some 911 cases to make an eight cylinder?
There's a guy out there who cuts two cylinders off a 911 block to make a
four cylinder, named Dean Popolus, I believe. At first he used the 911
distributor which would "skip" once between firing, or something of that
nature. Gave the engine an idling quality similar to a harley. Now I
think he's gone with crankfire ignition or something. One of the first
cars this engine went into was my father's old race car, now Gary
Emory's called "Desperado"-a '56 356 from HELL. I hear Milt Minter now
tools around in this thing. 

Speaking about 550s, we know a guy by the name of Richard Miller who has
an early Beck Replica-perhaps this is the same person you're speaking
about, Dion- he's a big authority on 356 restoration, helps Brett
Johnson out ofttimes. His spyder is done up right with porsche drum
brakes and all, but it is powered by a regular 356 pushrod powerplant-
still kicks. Other 550 guys include a guy in Japan who dragraces a beck
550 powered by a 3.6 911 engine and a G-50 transmision to match. That's
one big handful of a car!

I met Randy Beck once, had no idea he was connected to the Beck Spyders,
but was really kicking butt with his gutted 914/6 racecar. He was and I
would believe still is, using a 3.6 which remains relatively stock but
is mated to a 901 box. I know of another 914 racer who has a similar
setup with an even hotter motor and neither of them seem to have
problems with their gearboxes breaking.

Marc.
