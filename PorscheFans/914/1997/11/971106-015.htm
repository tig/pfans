	Dirk makes good points about a cool coil giving you a better spark.
	Where I disagree with him is on the need for a super-duper coil or
remote mounting on a totally-stock motor.  The stock one (or the Bosch Blue
one) work just fine--the super-duper coil won't do anything for you unless
you change other stuff in the motor.  (At a bare minimum, you'd need to
re-gap your spark plugs MUCH WIDER.)
	I'm not saying that you can't or shouldn't upgrade--just that the
stock system is adequate for an otherwise-stock motor.  If you want to
tinker with the plugs, wires, etc., use the improved coil.  If you want to
allow the possibility of tinkering later, you might consider the improved
coil.  But if you're just going to put it in and keep driving, then you
should consider the stock-type coil.

	Besides, I haven't disagreed with Dirk in over a week--I don't want
him to start gettin' lonely!   ;^)
