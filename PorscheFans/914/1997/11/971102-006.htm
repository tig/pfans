Carefull, this 3/16 glass is probably single layer_Tempered_ glass (common in
European countries for windsheilds, also used in USA for side and rear
windows ).  Tempered glass is designed with lots of internal stress, when the
glass is struck, the entire windsheild will break into ~ 1/4 inch pieces. 

A windsheild approved for use in USA (going back at least to the 50's) is
made with _three layers_.  The outside and inside are regular glass with a
layer of plastic in the center.  ( Look at a piece of american glass)  When
this glass is struck it only cracks on the side that was struck.  The plastic
layer prevents cracking on the opposite side and prevents medium size objects
from entering the passanger area.  

So. . . A car useing _tempered_ glass will shower the driver with small glass
pieces and the object that hit the windsheild.

A car useing _three layer glass_ will only have a crack.
