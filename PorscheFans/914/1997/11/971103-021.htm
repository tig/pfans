- Rich,
 
- Check out this lovely e-mail.
 
- Later, Allen 


Allen................This wonderful piece of work is just an example of the
very small group of people that should probably be protected from themselves.
 Pure mindless flame.  What's most interresting its sent to someone not even
on the Porsche Fans posting list!
I have happily posted and received thousands of e-mails from various
 PorscheFans lists (914, 911, Racing).  Each list seems to have a common
group of people that post, responding to questions trying to provide helpful
information.
As a long time 914 fanatic I have my opinions and respect that same position
of others.  Many times I see posting I don't agree with or that are incorrect
in part or whole.  Most of the time these obvious mistakes are corrected by
someone on the list that knows or can verify the right information.  I think
the intent of this forum is well supported by all of the posters with the
possible exclusion of the one above.  It does bring to light there are always
a few that don't quite fit in.  
Why Mr. Twins has such a shortsided opinion, limited vocabulary and
malfunctioning e-mail is a mystery to me.  If anyone knows Jim give him a
clue.
Thanks to everyone on the list who has helped me in the past!
