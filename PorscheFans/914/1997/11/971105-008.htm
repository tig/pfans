Hey guys,
First I would like to thank Rich Johnson for his reply and for getting
involved. By the way, I bought my 5-lug upgrade front & rear from Rich, he is
a great guy and I would reccommend him highly to anyone on the list. Secondly
I would like to thank Bill from Mark Stephens for calling me, after Rich
called him, to find out what was wrong and how he could correct it. I
explained why I was upset and that I was very disappointed with their heads.
He seemed surprised to hear about the notch in the combustion chamber. Anyhow
I am returning the head today and he will replace it with another. He said he
would do whatever it took to satisfy me. That seems fair enough. Mistakes
happen, perhaps the sales person is new or not that knowledgeable about
machine work? Who knows. I'm giving them a second chance in good faith, but I
do have a pretty good feelng about this. I will give a post on this again
when it is all settled and let you know how it turned out.
Thanks,
Ed Villela
