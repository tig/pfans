Jebby:

Torque is the product of a force and its moment arm.

In countries still stuck using the English system, force is measured
in pounds and the length of the moment arm is measured in feet, so
the units can be expressed either as pound-feet or foot-pounds; the
two are equivalent, since multiplication is commutative (i.e., A x B
= B x A).

Work is the product of a force and the magnitude of a displacement...
Again, we use units of pounds and feet, so work is ALSO expressed in
foot-pounds or pound-feet.

If you use vectors for both force and distance, work is the dot
product and is a scalar, while torque is the cross product and is a
vector.  This is neither here nor there; the important thing is that 
the two quantities (force and torque) end up using the same units.

Since this can sometimes be confusing, people sometimes use foot-lbs
to indicate work (or force parallel to the motion) and lb-feet to
indicate torque (or force perpendicular to the motion).

Note, however, that this is an ARTIFICIAL distinction.  It's just a
nomenclature convention intended to differentiate between the two
quantities for clarity; there's no real difference between
foot-pounds and pound-feet.

Personally, I don't know anyone who cares about the distinction 
enough to make an issue of it... Most people are perfectly 
comfortable dealing with torque expressed in foot-pounds.
