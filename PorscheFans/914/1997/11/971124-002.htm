Hi  Folks:

On friday 1121/97 I went to get a pizza for the family. Had not driven the
914 in several weeks. Stopped at the mailbox and got out to get the paper.
Remember my posts about looking for a handbrake handle? Anyway, as I
retreived the paper the Porsche started down our driveway. I ran after but
fell down. The car went into one of our creeks. fortunately missing a number
of large trees but rolling over a number of cedars. No body paint was
scratched!  We did bent the front and rear valances (Cedar trees) and broke
the driver's side chrome fog light grill/rubber seal for the panel that
allows access to the MC and steering gear.

I am looking for the valance panels.  Must be good to excellent. My research
of the catalogs indicates that the cost of an original part is prohibitive
and I'm not sure that I want to purchase a fiberglass replica or buy one from
a used part catalog. Has anyone purchased the FG replicas from AA/ Automotion
and are they ok? Since this is my original car, I really don't want to go the
FG way.
