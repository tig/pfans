If you can get one, do it.  Webers work fine when they're set up
properly.  And they sound VERY cool under full throttle.  But on a stock
engine, they just don't work as smoothly, quietly, and efficiently as
the original FI.  I drove my 74 2.0 with dual Webers for 3 years before
re-installing the FI and I still can't get over how much more I like the
car now.  Many of the folks on this list gave me lots of help and
encouragement during the process (thanks again to all of you).

As long as the lever that the loop-handle broke off from is still there,
you should be able to slide your seat forward and backward.  If so,
slide the seat all the way forward then tilt it all the way back (to
raise the front of it up for easier access).  Then stick a large flat
screwdriver along the rail (the one without the adjuster lever) and it
will release the safety catch that keeps the seat from sliding forward
off its rails.  With this catch held up and the adjustering lever held
up, slide the seat the rest of the way forward until it leaves its
tracks.  If your seat is real hard to slide you may want a helper with
this one so you can hold the releases while someone else pushes the seat
forward.  Grease the tracks real good before re-installing.  If you
can't get your seat to move, the method that Josh recommended will work,
but in my opinion, this way is a LOT easier.

Good luck.
