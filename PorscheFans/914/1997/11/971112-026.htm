Josh,

An article in European Car Dec 1997 dealt with these things and putting =
them in Porsches.

They noticed improved turn-in response, at the expense of an increase in =
ride harshness (but not too bad). They also reported that it was not a =
difficult installation, hard parts being removing the strut without a =
special tool, and removing the rubber strut mount bushing, which they =
just hacked away at.

The big advantage is in minimizing camber change on hard cornering due =
to flexing of the rubber strut bushing. They hypothesized that the =
rubber bushing could allow strut movement of as much as 1/4", which they =
calculated could cause a camber change of .75 degrees. The CamberBall =
should prevent most of this. I suppose this is most important with =
sticky racing tires, though.
