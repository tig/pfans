    Well, don't thank me TOO much, Jebby... Looking over what I
    wrote yesterday, I see that I could have been a lot clearer.

    In particular, I failed to point out that torque really should
    be expressed only in units of pound-feet; it's WORK that can be
    expressed either in pound-feet or foot-pounds.

    The reason, if you want to hear more mathematics, is this:

    Since work is the dot product of the force and distance vectors,
    it's a scalar.  In other words, work has a magnitude, but not a
    direction... If you push with a force of one pound a distance of
    one foot, you do one foot-pound of work whether you push left or
    right.

    Torque, on the other hand, is the CROSS product of the two
    vectors... So it, too, is a vector; it has both a magnitude AND a
    direction.  If you remember anything about vector math from
    school (or if you just think about it for a minute), you know
    that vector cross products are NOT commutative... That is, A x B
    is NOT equal to B x A.  In fact, A x B = -(B x A).

    The failure of the Commutativite Law for cross products implies
    that if a tightening torque is expressed in pound-feet, the same
    torque expressed in foot-pounds is a LOOSENING torque.

    So... Since work doesn't imply a direction, it can be expressed
    in foot-pounds or pound-feet, but torque should only be expressed
    in pound-feet.  Of course, I STILL don't know anyone who cares
    enough to make an issue of it.

    It's still for sale... And it's as much fun as ever; I took it
    out for the first time in a couple of weeks and drove it all
    weekend.  Had a GREAT time.
