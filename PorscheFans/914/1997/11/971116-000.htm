Ross:

Your AAR is next to the oil filler below the air cleaner box. It looks
like a small can with two pipes sticking out a right angles. Remove the
air cleaner to see it better. You should see a large hose entering and
leaving it. One of them connects to the front of the air cleaner itself.
The AAR acts as a valve that is open when cold to allow additional
filtered air to flow directly into the intake manifold and boost the
cold idle. It consists of a drilled shaft connected to a bimetallic
coil. An internal heating unit(and eventually the engine) heats the coil
which turns the shaft so the holes no longer align with the air passage.
It is supposed to close gradually as it warms up. Without the heating
unit it takes much longer to heat up (maybe forever).

What happens is it can stick open or closed. If stuck open you get an
incredibly high idle when the engine warms up. If closed, the car won't
idle when cold. Previous owners may have disconnected it for this reason
(bad idea).

It can fail for mechanical reasons, like dirt and corrosion on the
shaft, or for electrical reasons related to the internal heating unit.
Check that the heater wire is connected to a switched power source (but
not the coil, eh JJ?) experts, please tell us which one. It grounds to
the engine through it's base. If you connect it to a confirmed power
source and it doesn't get hot, check that the lead has not chafed
through the insulation where it exits the base. This can short directly
to ground and draw huge current while doing absolutly nothing useful.

Next check that you can blow air through it when cold (ambient temp) and
that you can't when it heats up. If it is stuck, I have had good success
freeing it with some motor oil dripped in one of the air passages to
free the shaft. I then connect it to a 12V power source ((+) to the
wire, (-) to the base) to heat it up and turn the shaft. A few cycles of
this seems to do the trick.  

To see if it is causing your low idle disconnect the hose running to the
manifold (not the air cleaner). You should get about 4000 rpm idle(!)
until you plug it with your finger.

My car is not close at hand for checking routing of the air hoses. I am
sure someone else can give you that information.
