I can't say that 4 quarts per month is normal, but 1 quart per 500 miles
isn't unheard of.  I don't know if you put 2000 miles on the car in one
month, but if you did, then don't worry too much about it.  On the other
(more likely) hand, assuming you haven't driven the car that much, I'd
start by identifying where the leak is.  If you can find a substantial
leak, then try to fix it.  The most common trouble spots for me have
been at the strainer, at the drain plug, and of course, at the push rod
tubes.  If you can't find a substantial leak, then you'll want to do a
compression check to see how good the engine really is.  If your
compression is less than 100 psi, you're looking at a probable rebuild.
The only way to really tell is with a leakdown.  There's a good
possibility that you're valves need an adjustment.  If I'm not mistaken,
poorly adjusted valves can cause both low compression checks and
excessive oil consumption.

Good luck, I hope it's the lesser-of-evils!
