I know someone who cusom made a roof rack that bolts to the factory ski
rack hard-points. It went forward over the roof (high enough to allow
roof removal and instalation) and had a large pad that would rest on the
top of the windshield frame. The rack was welded out of square steel
tubing, and was very stiff. He claimed it was sturdy enough to hold a
windurfer board at 90+ mph. I don't particularly doubt it, but wouldn't
want to test it. I have no idea how much it cost though, it was a custom
job. I would _not_ mount something to the roof itself, it's pretty
frail, and won't take much before it gives up somewhere.

If it's not lowered and you keep weight in it (full gas tank, spare tire
etc.) it should do pretty well, just take it easy. But get studs on the
front too if you can. Get narrow tires, the narrower the better for
snowy stuff. The 914 doesn't weigh that much, so you want to increse
your lbs/sq in as much as you reasonably can. I'm running 175 (GASP!)
width snow tires so I can get my car to and from autocrosses and time
trial events in the winter. It's kinda funny to look at my snow tires
next to my race wheels and tires. 175 vs. 225. :)
