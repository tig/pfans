>>Any information would be greatly appreciated.  I know there are many
people
that know just about everything there is to know about cars.  Simply, how
did
you get to that point?<<

Practice, practice, practice, and a determination to do it yourself no
matter what!  It is really one of those things, it is rare to find a
natural wrench!  So how do you get there, from where you are.  Start with
the simple stuff and work your way up.

I have a friend who has little wrench capability for nature, but he tries
everything.  He can now drop the engine by him self, replace gaskets, do
suspension and brake work, minor body work.  And what is he learning this
winter engine rebuilding.  I gave him one to grenade before he did it to
his 2.0 liter.  We will hook it up to my test stand when done and see
what we get.  It might blow up, it might run for a good long time.  But
either way he learned something and TRIED it.  If you give up you will
never learn, and no matter how much you can read, some things are best
experienced with your own two hands.

Ah you got to start somewhere.

A few simple rules.

If you want to learn but are afraid of screwing up your car, get a part
from the junk yard and try it out.  No I am not kidding, if you want to
learn body work, get the worse looking dented, beat up paint chipped
rusted fender you can find.  If you can get a 914 fender even better. 
But in reality a beatles fender will serve you well, lots of curves.  At
any rate work on make mistakes and you only spent a ten spot and some
paint, but you learned.  If you don't like then you still only spent a
ten spot, and you learned.  All other items are the same way, get a junk
type-4 out of a bus $100, take it down and build back up.  Spend
$200-$300 but you learned.  And if it does blow up, you are out $300 but
hey you did not ruin your 914.

And then the last thing is patients, you can not be a good mechanic or
person without it.  If you have little patients, just move on and fell
good about spending the money and finding someone who can do it.

Like my old music professor used to say if he did not like your playing. 
" You need to go buy records and let the pros make the music."  Luckily I
never heard those words, except him telling others.

By no means do I want to discourage you from pressuring this adventure,
NO, just go in with your thinking cap on.

Take care,
