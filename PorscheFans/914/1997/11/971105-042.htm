Tonight I was able to speak to my best friend on the telephone.  But for
some safety equipment and serendipity that might not have been possible.

This morning a person-not-quite-awake forced his 914 off the road.  He hit a
curb, pitched the car sideways and hit a telephone pole on the passenger
side door, just ahead of the sail panel.  The impact sheared the right rear
suspension console, fender, wheel, etc.

While I'm upset about the loss of his project car, I am grateful that he was
able to un-strap his 5-point harness, lift himself out of his sport seat
(lateral support), and live another day.  I can't imagine what might have
happened to him if he was loosely placed in the car.

Look at your safety equipment guys.  I'm talking restraints, seats, brakes,
etc.  I'm sure they saved my friend some serious injury, or worse.  They're
certainly a higher priority than some of the things we buy for these cars.

Cory, if yer lurkin', I'll be with Bill and what's left of his car tomorrow
night and I'll miss the PCA meeting (again).
