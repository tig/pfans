Bob,
I would agree to all of your points, but I would like to add some thoughts.
 I've been in love with these things, but never really saw one up close
until this Summer at a local PCA autocross.  It was an older Beck kit, but
the guy did it right.  All Porsche parts (including OEM interior pieces  --
at least as many as he could get).  Porsche suspension, 4 cam motor, the
works.  As he explained it to me:  he could have gotten away with a $12 to
$15,000 car with VW parts and engine, instead he built a $35 - $40,000 car
with all Porsche stuff.  So the cons in the above list could change
drastically depending on how you decide to 'build' the car!  By the way, he
was FLYING on the course, on street tires  :).

I've got no reason to doubt the contents of his car because he rebuilds
356's for people and does an amazing job.  Man was that Beck beautiful!

Any 1/2 finished ones out there for sale?
