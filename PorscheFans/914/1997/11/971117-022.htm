	There are several different schools of thought on the tranny
robustness question.  One looks at what Porsche did in 72--switch from
the 901 to the 915, just as the 911S got bumped up to 210 HP (DIN).
This would indicate that, for real street-car reliability, they didn't
want to put more than about 200 HP through the 901 box.
	Another school of thought says that the 901s are good for up to
about 300 HP.  And it does--there are quite a few 901 folks with 200-300
HP motors.  However, the trannies don't typically last as long as you
might want a street-car's transmission to last.  (What, 200K-300K miles?)
But it's an awful lot cheaper and easier to use a 901 than a 915  (and
MUCH cheaper and easier than the G-50!) that you can afford to throw
away several 901s before you get close to the cost of a "flipped" 915
or G-50.
	I know one person with a 2.8L 914/6 with a 901 side-shifter.
He quotes his HP numbers at "in the neighborhood of 300+", and he has
gone through two or three sets of ring and pinion gears.  (They look
really ugly with several teeth missing, by the way!)  This is an all-out
race car, and is not at all "babied".
	901 first gears do tend to be fragile, so you should avoid doing
clutch-dumps if you have a powerful motor.  Many of the larger motors
have enough torque so that starting off in 2nd works just fine.  YMMV.

	I recently heard from some local autoXers that one of the main
problems with the CVs isn't that they can't handle the power, but that
the geometry gets further out of line than they can easily deal with in
many lowered cars.  I don't remember the exact fix they mentioned, but
it either replaced or moved the circlip that holds the CV in place, and
moved the CV in a bit, or allowed it a larger range of motion sliding
along the driveshaft.  They claimed that this would drastically reduce
the failure rate of the CVs.
	(Names are withheld in case I'm mis-remembering this stuff; I
don't want anyone else blamed for my mistakes.)
	Again, YMMV.
