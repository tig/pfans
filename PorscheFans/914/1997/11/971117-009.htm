O.K., I'm getting really close.  Since I've stopped worrying about
rushing to get the car done (since it's 20 degrees and snowing every
other day), I've actually made a good amount of progress.  The car
appears to run much better with the Aux. Air Valve disconnected, and I
managed to find a wire on the harness close to the Aux. Air Valve that
has been snipped.  (For those that need the quick refresher, my mechanic
hooked my Aux. Air Valve up to my coil, which appears to have been
drawing power from the coil causing weak spark and other assorted
problems).  I think it's probably the wire that the Aux. Air Valve had
been hooked up to originally, but my multimeter isn't picking up any
voltage with the key on, so I'm not too sure.  Regardless, I was able to
find a few more problems, or maybe just one problem that manifests
itself as several problems.  When the engine starts its erratic
half-power nonsense, I can pull the wires to injectors 2 and 3 without
any decrease in engine speed.  I could tell that there was a loose wire
at the #2 injector because jiggling it stabilized the motor.  I gently
tightened each of the connectors grips with an awl (It's amazing how
many times I've used that tool on my car...), and now I can no longer
change the engine's behavior by jiggling the wires at the #2 plug, but
it appears to be missing on #2 and #3 all of the time now, instead of
just erratically.  The connector to the trigger points has always been
loose, so I gave it the awl treatment as well, but it hasn't fixed the
problem.  So, it looks like I'm probably just dealing with a loose wire
at either injector #2, #3, or at the trigger points in the base of the
distributor.  I'm not sure what the most cost effective way of
proceeding is.  In a perfect world, I'd get four new injectors and a
brand new wiring harness, but as long as those items cost $900, it's not
going to happen.  So, if you were in my shoes, how would you proceed?

Thanks again!
