Hi,
I'm new to this list and planned on lurking for awhile but I feel
compelled to respond to this.

If you do take the strainer cover off of the car be VERY careful putting
it back on.  The shop that I work for charges an extra $20 to do this
job, not because it's takes much time or is hard but because if you over
tighten the bolt when you put it back the aluminum boss in the motor
will break off and the engine case will have to be removed and
replaced.  It is a good idea but I recommend borrowing a small torque
wrench or using a 1/4" ratchet and very little force.
