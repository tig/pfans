I have two tasks in mind over the four day Turkey Holiday. One is a full
tuneup to the 75 914 1.8 L-jet in order to pass WA state smog by Dec.
31.This should go as usual, fairly routine. (valves and timing-no pts. w/
the elec. ignition)

The other project is straightening the mtg plates for my engine bar. The
bar itself is straight and listmembers gave me some good how to advice
when I inquired a couple months back. I have a helper lined up and jacks,
jackstands and all. I really need to get it vertical as it is blocking my
access to the oil filter. I've gone a couple of changes with the same
FRAM and its gotta go. I plan on taking the bolts out and straightening
the outboard mounts (unless someone has a couple of good ones?)  and
putting it all back together with new bolts and nuts.

My question:   What size are the bolts? I want to replace them and I
don't want to take one out and haul it to the hardware store cuz this is
my daily driver. Anybody know?
Please reply by list.

(I am so glad that the sports seat and zymol gremlins have been taken
care of. Never again!)
 Nick
