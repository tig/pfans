I recently aquired a '74 2.0 and found that there are two things that
leak worse than water into the passenger compartment - the engine and
transmission.

I believe the engine leaks out of the rear bell housing. Someone told me
that this could only be the rear seal or the galley plugs.  The
transmission seems to ooze from every possible seal and gasket (went
through ~4 qts in 500 miles).

Before I dismantle it, I was hoping to gather some information from
people who know.  My plan was to drop the transmission and basically
take it apart to replace all of the major seals and gaskets.  While out,
I was hoping to access the rear of the engine (still in the car) to
replace the rear seal and galley plug seals.

Is the feasible?

Can I replace the rear seal and galley plug seals without removing the
engine?

There is nothing in Hanes about galley plugs.  What are they and will
it be readily obvious where they are and how to do this when looking
into the rear bell housing?

Any advice will be greatly appreciated!


Thanks in advance!
