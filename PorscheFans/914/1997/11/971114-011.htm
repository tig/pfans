I am personnely waiting for the Beck 904 kit to come out.  It is in there
some where, being worked on as interest is peaked.  I have waited 15 years so
far what is another 15.  At this point thou I could just build my own.

Yes I do know AA has a 9014 kit, but it is not to my tastes.  I really like
the original 904 lines and weird little quirks.  The 9014 has lost some of
them, even thou it is probably a more practical car for an every
day/occasional car.  And priced much better than say a Beck 904 would dream
of being.

Even though the 904 doesn't float my boat the same way, I certainly
understand the urge!  It looks like the 904's unique box sheet metal ladder
chassis could be replicated without too much grief, so the only major
questions would be suspension related (adapt components from other
Porsches(?), other aftermarket sources(?), assuming that VW bars & towers
won't get you where you want to be).  Of course, no one ever said dreams need
to be practical or affordable!

My dream of dreams is a replica 908-3 with a wicked six cylinder 911 motor
that revs so high that dogs can't hear it.

I agree about the AA 9014 kit.  From the photos in their catalog it just
doesn't quite cut it... especially since a sweetly done flared 914 is so damn
neat.

On the "do whatever you want" issue, I take a slightly different tack.  They
made gazillions of 911s, basic 356s and 914s, so go ahead and make your dune
buggy, modified quarter midget, whatever.  They only made a few hundred (?)
550s though, so I think there is a certain logic in seeing that these go to
owners who will preserve them.  Replicas?  Let the games begin!

P.S.
Of course, our Beck 550 Spyder replica owner friend with the 4-cam writes
that beast off his taxes as a business expense.  I'm not happy about picking
up the difference, since he does nothing to contribute to upgrading my 928
(big 17" wheels, chip, throaty exhaust & headers, major sound system, S4 rear
wing...).
