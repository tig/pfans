Bill......Welcome to the dark side!  Not really.  I think I've been
permanently spoiled by the 3.0L conversion and would expect you to also find
the "converted" qualities of the S components in your 914 very favorable.  I
don't know where it would put you in the PCA racing classes but for simple
daily enjoyment the change would be a good one.
 
<< I recently purchased a 911S that had been stored for several years. Runs
great but is rusted. Will be parting out the car, and am toying with the
idea of putting the engine in my 914 track car. 
-RJ- A carburated or MFI '73 S engine would make for the easiest transplant.
 It will fit the 914s engine bay with little or no modification.  Add a set
of 914-6 sheet metal, a reproduction set or handmade set to your list of
"stuff".  The OE 911 cooler will also need a slight mod. to work.

<< What is the best source for a mounting kit?
-RJ- I'm working on a variation of the centermount (may be able to use your
help here).  There are several other "cross-bar" mounts available that work
fairly well for most projects.  I prefer the center mount as it eliminated
any interferrence, or flex  problems.  It is also the closest to the factory
mount and produces a very clean finished product.  The only down side is it
will also be the most expensive when compared to the others.  Up side is the
front mount from your S can be used to make the centermount which will help
in cost.

<< Does any one know if the oil tank from the 73 S will fit the 914?
-RJ- The tank will not fit as is.  I have heard that it can be cut a modified
to work but the rub is it doesn't line up with the factory mounting points,
will require the internal tank baffles and line attachments to be altered.
A suggestion would be to consider a factory tank.  They are available and can
use the S oil filter console and filler neck.  I may know of a used one.

<< Will the S brakes fit the 914 (72)?
-RJ- Perfectly.  The only change you "may" have to make is the lower ball
joint.  I think your "S" strut will have a wedge pin attachment and I'm not
sure whether your '72 914 has this style or the earlier pinch type ball
joint.

-RJ- Dave C. mentioned the rear 5 lug hub conversion.  Your right, the 911
hub will mount into the 914s trailing arm useing the OE bearing.  The problem
with this approach is that the spline of the 911 rear hub is different from
the 914s and S axle may present length problems and inner tran. mount
differences (901 vs. 915).  You may be able to adapt the S outer drive flange
to the 914s axle.  I'ld check this possibility out.  Alternatively the
modified 914 rear hubs works very well and can simplify this conversion. 
I don't know what wheels came on your "S" but 5.5X15, 6 X15 or 6X16 Fuchs
will also work fine on a stock bodied 914.  Each will work with any of the
common 205 series tire variations.

<< Thanks, Bill Dugan, Arlington,Tx
-RJ- Good luck Bill.  Give me a call if you have any questions.
