> When attending the 914 Renegade meet this fall in Branson, I had the
> pleasure to meet Ian McMillan, from Dublin, a member of Porsche Club
> GB, who detailed for us in pictures and detail his three year project
> converting a LHD 914 to RHD, as well as from a four to a six. From
> what I understand, some elements were fairly straightforward,
> reflecting his belief that Porsche originally had a RHD car engineered
> into the design. The pedal cluster, for instance, was relatively easy,
> using a RHD pedal cluster, etc from a RHD 911. Other elements, such as
> the dash were incredibally difficult, requiring 23 seperate cuts, and
> rewelds to make a presentable dash. He was also assisted by
> engineering students at the local university, who fabricated a
> beautiful equal length heat exchanger- header system for the six.
> After nearly three years, it still wasn't finished, and I think this
> may qualify as one of the all time difficult projects that you can
> attempt with a streetable 914.
