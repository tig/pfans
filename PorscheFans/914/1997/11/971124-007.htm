The harness itself? If you're going to cover it, make it's _very_ water
resistant. Otherwise, don't cover much at all. _Trapped_ moisture is
what you want to avoid. But no, you don't _need_ to make the entire
harness resistant. Just make sure that the connections, and anywhere
else that the insulation has been broken is effectively water tight.

BrakeClean is pretty harsh, and can be used, but I'd use something a
little easier like contact cleaner. You can probably buy a couple cans
of it at your local Trash Shack (Radio Shack).

Depends on the wire and the useage. In your case remeber that you are
attempting to repair an existing wire that is still in use. Twisting the
ends together would be great, but you may wind up shortening the wire
too much. A lap joint would seem the best but it is not the most
reliable. What I would recomend is inserting a small peice a wire in
between and twisting both ends before you solder. 

When soldering, remember to clean the wire ends in question thoroughly,
and not just with a solvent. Use a fine grade sand paper or something to
clean the oxidation off the copper. You should see shiny metal before
you tin it. "Tinning" is where you heat the wire up first with the
soldering iron and then apply the solder to the wire so that it melts
easilly and runs over the small length of wire you're concerned with.
This preps the wire end and helps ensure a much better joint. Be
carefull not to melt too much insulation, and use a good heat shrink to
cover your repairs to avoid possible shorts.
