Dion makes a really good point, although his fortune was exceptionally
good. Swap meets are an excellent source of a variety of sizes and
manufacturers, and may be partucularly good for the person hunting a bar
and bushings without any of the related hardware.  I got all my mounting
hardware, droplinks, bushing cups, etc. by buying 2 incomplete early
911/914 bars for $20 ea. each; then bought a 7/8" (very close to 22mm)
heat-tempered 4130 alloy rod for $12 from the steel yard.  Ends
machined-$20; bushings-$25, 3/8" rod ends-$25 (got to have that
adjustability...) Voila: 22mmfront swaybar for just over a hundred
bucks.

Don't count out swap meets as a source for the budget-conscious
performance enhancements.  And yes, sometimes you can find Weltmeisters
in the box; always at less than low-retail cost.
