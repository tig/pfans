Rob, the frame you describe for the 904 is what's called a "Ladder
frame", I believe. The 904/6? The guys who did it might as well have
started from scratch instead of sacrificing (oh, the horror) an original
six for the project. From what I recall, they used the rear inner panels
and suspension mounts of the six and perhaps the bulkhead-mounted engine
mount as well. Since we have so many naysayers to the torque handling
ability of the 901 boxes, I wonder what kind of transmission Porsche
used to handle the power of the two 914/8 cars? Hmmm? How about the 901?
I don't know of any other gearboxes Porsche had at the time besides
whatever racing boxes they used. Perhaps the eight cylinder cars were
modified to use these, but I doubt it. By the way, the Piech car has an
interesting bodystyle-different headlights, bumper, etc. Was it an early
prototype converted to a "special project" car?
