If it's a 72, then it may have an unusual arangement. Seeing as how the
'72s were originally tail shifters. However, the only really difficult
bushing(s) are those upstream of the firewall. All in all, it's not
really a tough job. Make sure you have replacement set screws as well.
The set screws that hold the longitudinal shift rod in place.

It's a racing pattern. That way first and reverse, gears that are
_rarely_ used in a racing situation, are out of the way and downshifting
from 3rd and 5th are easier.
