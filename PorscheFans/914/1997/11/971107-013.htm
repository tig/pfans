To Dave Trammell:
In case the Pertronix people can't/won't fax you a copy of the owners
"manual", send me an e-mail with a fax number.  I've still got the
various papers that come with the units.  I'll fax ya a copy.  

 I've got Pertronix in each of my cars (70 914-6, 74 914, 62 & 63 Karmann
Ghias)  never had a problem, seem to be reliable as a brick (almost as
few moving parts).  
I use these to drive a variety of ignition stuff; a Bosch blue coil, a
MSD CD box, and two Delta Mark 10B CD units (which drive standard coils).
 Works fine with all of em'; the Pertronix seem to work with anything. 
The suggestion by somebody to mount the coil OFF THE ENGINE is a real
good step.  Vibration beats em to death.  Preferably mount it with the
high tension tip facing up - I've seen several coils leak their
insulating oil and then they fail (been there, done that, got the
trophy).

(I'll call the 2 cents & raise ya 2)            Mike Tarter
