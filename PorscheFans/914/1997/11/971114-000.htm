Rob,
I would agree to all of your points, but I would like to add some thoughts.
 I've been in love with these things, but never really saw one up close until
this Summer at a local PCA autocross.  It was an older Beck kit, but the guy
did it right.  All Porsche parts (including OEM interior pieces  -- at least
as many as he could get).  Porsche suspension, 4 cam motor, the works.  As he
explained it to me:  he could have gotten away with a $12 to $15,000 car with
VW parts and engine, instead he built a $35 - $40,000 car with all Porsche
stuff.  So the cons in the above list could change
drastically depending on how you decide to 'build' the car!  By the way, he
was FLYING on the course, on street tires  :).

I've got no reason to doubt the contents of his car because he rebuilds 356's
for people and does an amazing job.  Man was that Beck beautiful!  Any 1/2
finished ones out there for sale?

Dion,
I must admit that my interest in the Beck 550 Spyder replica is based
primarily on the aesthetics and the ability to have a NEW one, not any
slavish (IMHO) desire for authenticity.  Who in their right mind would
actually run a Porsche 4-cam motor?  Sure, they sound great, but compared to
a well done Type 1, 356/912, Type 4 or small 911 engine, are the 4-cams
really worth what must be, after maintenance, running costs of over (real
wild guess!) $100/hour?

Myself, I wouldn't give up the advantages of reliable modern disc brakes just
to have authentic drums, or forego modern bushing materials, shocks,
electrics, etc.  I would not, however, go with very wide, square-shouldered
low-profile tires, as these would truly change the original balance of the
design.  Ditto for power assists on brakes and steering.  Transmissions --
modern 5- or six-speeds, synchromesh and closer &/or different gearing are a
thornier issue on the "feel/function" front, but something I would do.

I view this as consistent with the American hot-rodder spirit, with tactile,
kinaesthetic "beauty" added to the visual... separate but (IMHO) equally as
valid as the European "originality" aesthetic.  How many 914's -- which the
second vision would dismiss and not worth the restoration -- live on because
of the first vision?

P.S.
The thoroughly forgettable film "Love Potion No.9" has, in the last 5
minutes, a beautiful deep yellow 550 Sypder replica.  Not worth the $1.99
rental except for the fanatically curious.
