Well, it's not a chain rattling sound, it's more like a loud exhaust
"burble".  It's similar to the sound caused by a poor seal between the
heat exchanger and the head.  It just kind of sounds like unmuffled
exhaust.  My first inclination is that one of the injectors isn't firing
(either because it's defective, or because there's a loose connection),
and that extra air being pumped into the exhaust is causing little
explosions in the exhaust with the unburned fuel.  Does that make sense?
If someone out there with a '75 or '76 has ever heard the noise made by
a loose air injector pipe, please help me describe this a little better!
Is it possible that the extra air from the Aux. Air valve could somehow
be causing this problem?  Maybe it's running way lean with the extra air
and the noise I'm hearing is detonation?  I'm reaching...

Thanks again,
