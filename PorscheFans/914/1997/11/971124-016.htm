C.K...........I know that a company called Crayford in England (I believe)
converted a car or two in the same period the 914s were produced.  I am not
familiar with exactly what they did but have seen some "conversion process"
pictures of Ian McMullians.  He is a Irishman who is in the process of making
a RHD 914-6.  Certified 914 fanatic also!  Bob Furbank is going through the
same process down in Australia.
Both of these guys are very knowledgeable craftsman and would be more than
happy to send you or discuss the conversion process.  E-mail if you want
their internet addresses.
I was one of several folks that met Ian at the Branson, MO 914 gathering.  He
is quite literate on the history of the conversion cars and has some very
good ideas on improvements he is incorporaqting into his RHD 914.  He may
possibly be able to answere some of your importing questions.

Good Luck!..........Rich
