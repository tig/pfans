Hi Matt,

The aftermarket FI you are talking about is the one by CB Performance.
I've got their catalog also and have been toying with the idea of it for my
Thing for awhile, possible the 914 if when I rebuild I do some non stock
stuff that exceeds the original FI capacity.

Someone on one of the VW lists I'm on just bought one of these systems and
has started to post reports.  All that has happened so far is that he
received it, it looks ok.  He has started figuring out where to mount
controllers and run wires.  Right now he is trying to decide how to deal
with the fuel and return lines which the original VW doesn't have or are
too small.  The kit included hose for these lines but recommends running
hard lines.  The guy is trying to decide if he can get the hardlines
through the center tunnel or run them underneath but protected somehow.

Once he starts to post any more technical info on the CB CFI system I'll
forward it to the 914 list.

Hi all...

I have a '70 914 dedicated track car.  I've been setting it up, and
working bugs out all summer, and finally got it to the track in Nov.
 Whew!  I've been wondering about modifications for next year.  The car
is a 1.7 with a NPR big bore kit @ 94mil.  I was told that would make it
a 1.9.  When I bought the car it had been fitted with a carburator
conversion kit.  The kit was actually manufactored for replacing the
solex carbs on a VW bus, but seems to fit nicely on a 914.

I love the way the car handles.  It's fantastic.  But I must say I'm not
too happy with the "getup and go".  My BMW (1.8 with FI) and my brothers
car (914 2.0 with FI) both seem to have considerably more power.  My
engine is *very* fresh, so I am assuming it's the crappy carb setup.

I know that most 914/4 people probably prefer the FI as opposed to some
"hack" conversion.  I would personally have FI, but I don't think I could
go through installing that.  Also, FI has changed a great deal since
then.

I was wondering if anyone has glanced through some of the VW mags, and
all the suppliers that sell stuff, some for the 914.  One supplier, whose
catalog I got, has bolt on competition fuel injection in various
configurations, complete with dash controls, for about $1500.  I know
that seems like a lot, but it seems that this would be a major
advancement for this engine.  That and an electronic ingintion...

Does anyone have any expiriences with this type of after market FI?

Thanks for any info.

Matt
