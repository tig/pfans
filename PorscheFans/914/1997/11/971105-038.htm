Fellow 914ers:

Two years of faithful fairly trouble free service by my '75 1.8 ended
definitively 3 weeks ago with ugly metal-on-metal bottom end noises. I'm
not sure what went south, but finding a missing cam-plug when I pulled
the flywheel might be a clue.  Fortunately I was able to locate a good
used motor locally and swapped it in over a 3 day weekend and several
afternoons - boy, what a job. What was really frustrating is that I'd
swapped in a rebuilt tranny and new clutch only 3 weeks before.

It did give me an excuse to swap in new rubber for the main seal,
flywheel o-ring, injector o-rings, push-rod tube seals, intake
manifolds, motor mounts, and fuel and vacuum lines. I couldn't find a
local source for the bigger diameter hoses to the aux air valve and
decel valve, but the hoses looked fine. 

My oil leaks and lean hunt at idle are gone (yay), but I have a new
problem, which I think is related to my decel valve. The idle runs
1600-1800 rpm after decelerating. Sometimes it will settle down to about
900 after sitting at a light for 10-15 seconds, but usually it won't.
When I clamp the hose to the aux air regulator, there's no change, but
when I clamp the hose to decel valve, the idle reliably goes back to
normal. The decel valve has vacuum when decelerating on the upstream
side as described by Haynes, which supposedly means it's functional. Do
I need a new decel valve, hoses, or is it the aux air regulator? If a
new decel valve, anyone have a source? It's not in any of the major
catalogs.

Thanks, Gary.
