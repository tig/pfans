I have no clue to what will fit in a 16" wheel, however i run a 15" wheel in
a 7" size.  I have had to roll my fenders with a base ball bat, but i do have
clearance to run a Firestone Potenza 225/50/15.  It may be that Firestone
might produce a tire that would have a profile to fit on a 16" rim with a
rolled fender.
