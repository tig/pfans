OK, so this is my first post to the 914 list (been a silent member for the
past couple of months) to just kind of watch the chat and pick up some
advice.  Now I'm convinced - I need a 914.

Having done a number of track events, I am looking for a good, solid 914.
Location is not a problem, but the car will be used principally for AutoX
and track, so it would end up being "somewhat" modified (probably a 3.0 or
3.2), 915, GT flares, etc. However, like my 911 track car, would be
borderline street legal (don't ask, I live in NH...)

If you have a good solid 914 (already built-up to a solid roller)- or more
importantly, any advice - please email me. I've read most of the FAQ's I can
find on the net, so I think I'm pretty well prepared to tackle the project.
Also, have rebuilt a bunch of 911's (street & track), 944s and Turbo's
(forgive me, but I had to learn on something) over the past 14 years. Now I
need a 914 of my own (I'm sick of seeing their tail lights through the esses
on the tracks).  Any advice or pointers would be great...  And now is the
time (it has already snowed in NH - so I've got the time...)

Thanks in advance,
John Dunkle

and a 88 Ford Bronco (snowbeater & parts fetcher :-)
