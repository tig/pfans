I have had both Intake and Exhaust valve seats 'slip-out'.

The first time (about 6 years ago), the motor was pretty fresh, I had
prepared the car for PCA timetrial (basically stock 914/2.0l FI).
After engaging in a rather spirted drive (on the street) and shutting 
down with out much cool off.... the engine would not start and made
expensive clanking sounds.... the exhaust valve seat had slipped out
side-ways, blocked the valve from closing completely and caused
it to hit the piston lightly.
I found the valve was not bent, the ding in my piston could be cleaned
up and not cause a problem... and my local machinist (w/lots of TYP I/IV
experience) cut a slightly larger, clean counterbore in the cylinder
head, and
installed an 'oversized' seat (I did not measure - don't know where it
came from).
This has preformed through 4 years of timetrialing (two drivers).

Lately, I had an Intake valve do the same thing - similar results; I
should
be able to reuse piston, valve; need new seat and guides.

MY THEORY:
After having this occur twice under similar circumstances, although in
different
valves:
If the engine is run hard and put away 'wet'; the heat in the heads go
through
the roof when you shut down.  This Heat Soak -often causes vacuum lock
in early cars with the fuel pump in the engine bay - enlarges the
counter bore
in the head that holds the valve seat.  Due to metal fatigue and many
thermal
cycles in the aluminum head material, the seat slips out on what ever
valve
is open just the right amount.  If the seat does not re-seat when the
valve starts 
moving again; you got the problem.   Hopefully the damage is minimal....

The 914 2.0 valves are pretty big. This makes the problem worse as the
head has
more material removed, and less aluminum to 'stablize' the size of the
counter bore.

This time I plan to replace ALL the seats in the heads (along with all
the guides - which
I always do).  I also plan to peen-over the head in the area around the
seats.  If the seats
get loose again when the motor is real hot, hopefully they will not slip
out.....

Subject: Valve seats dropping out of heads.


Hello,

I've been plagued with a nasty sort of problem
due to, I believe age (not me, my cars. .) :]

I have two 914 2.0 engines each that dropped
an intake valve seat out of the head bore.
This sucks because it holds the valve open
and you lose a cylinder. . .it can be a complete
drop, or a partial with a canted seat, I have both!
Oh, that makes a wonderful conundrum. .

My dilemma, it would seem, is that the local machine
shops think it is ok to swage the seat back in by beating
the material around the seat bore with a rectangular
drift punch. . Aack!  The factory installs these by heating the
head, and chilling the seat and just dropping them in.
After many years of use (23 in my case), time takes its
toll and undoes what the factory so fitfully did.

My question; is there a better way?
