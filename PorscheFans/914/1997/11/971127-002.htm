I've never seen a decent 912 for 5,000$. There was a 3,000$ one here
locally, but it was a mess. I can't stand the fact that people charge so
much for that car. I really wanted a 912 rather than the 2002, but the
bimmer is sooo much cheaper both to buy and repair. It also has more
horsepower than either a 912 or 914. (110 stock, 130 injected), and it
weighs the same. The 2002 is just shaped like a brick and has a higher
center of mass. Oh well....
