Wow, you've got a whole bunch of em'!  First off, have you verified that
your head temp sensor is good?  I'm trying to remember, but I think you
should read about 2000 ohms cold, and about 350 warm.  It's a
single-wire sensor mounted in the head between the sparkplugs on the
driver's side (at least mine is).  Now, it either sounds like you lost
the rubber gasket, or the seal between the injectors and the intake
runners was ruined when you tested them.  This results in a vacuum leak,
which leads to a high idle due to extra unmetered air entering the
system.  With the engine running, *carefully* spray a little carb
cleaner around the intake runners and injectors.  The carb cleaner will
be sucked into the engine wherever the leak is, causing the idle to
temporarily rise.  When this happens, you'll know where your leak is.
The injector gaskets are available from GPR (www.gprparts.com) for
something like $6.00 for the whole set.  As far as adjusting the idle
goes, you really don't want to be adjusting it with the computer.  Due
to your vacuum leak, you engine is running lean.  By adjusting the
computer, you get it to run at a normal mixture again, which drops the
idle.  What you'll notice is that after you fix your vacuum leak, your
engine will now be very rich at idle, and you'll need to readjust the
computer again.  Adjusting mixture without an exhaust gas analyzer isn't
the easiest thing in the world.  If you really want to adjust your idle
speed, you should do it with the adjustment screw on the throttle body.
The fact that your engine is "popping" and spitting out black stuff
indicates that your attempt to adjust the idle with the computer has
made the mixture *way* too rich, and all of that unburnt fuel is
igniting in the exhaust, causing little backfires.  I'd set your
computer back to where it was, and fix those vacuum leaks.  Also, check
your manifold pressure sensor... it could easily be causing most of your
problems.

Good luck!
