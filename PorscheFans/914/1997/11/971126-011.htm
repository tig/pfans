	Yes.  It will also be a *very* fun car.  It will be competitive
in PCA competition, because it will usually be classed exclusively with
other 914s.  It will be less competitive in SCCA competition, where it
will be forced to run with more powerful cars.  (CSP=BMW M3, Mazda Rx-7,
Honda CRX, Miata Miata Miata Miata, etc.)  The other cars in that list
fare better with CSP-legal mods than the 914 generally does.  Also, the
CSP-legal go-fast parts are somewhat easier to find (and less expensive)
for all of those but the BMW, which is a pretty amazing car out of the
box.
	There are lots of go-fast type stuff for the 914, but they usu-
ally carry Porsche price-tags.  Quite a few of them are 911 parts.  And
many of them will put you up against the Big Boys in the SCCA classes.
(Modified and beyond!)
	The 914 is a fine choice for Porsche race car.  You can have an
inordinate amount of fun for relatively few bucks.  Another good choice
for this is the 924, particularly the 924S (which is an 87 944 with 924
bodywork).  Plenty of handling and brakes available, fairly light weight,
very inexpensive, moderate to good power, and (I think) a reasonable
selection of go-fast goodies.
	A race-prepped 944 is probably out of reach for that kind of
money, but can still be worth looking into.  Lots of racing parts are
available, though.
	The water-pumpers can be competitive in SCCA competition.  (Or
has that been changed recently?  They tend to change the rules when any
Porsche starts doing well...)
	A 912 is another good choice in the price range.  You can find
them for $5K not infrequently, which still gives you some change to put
the safety items in and start work on the go-fast stuff.  Of course, all
the go-fast stuff are 356 parts (for the motor), or 911 parts (for every-
thing else) and will cost like Porsche parts...  A 912 will probably not
be competitive in the SCCA, though I'm not really sure.
	An early 911 might just fit into the budget, but safety mods and
race prepping are likely to put you overbudget.

	Basically, any Porsche will have a chance in PCA competition.
Like Josh2 says, "If you aren't competitive in any class, we'll make a
class for you!"  For the most part, cars will be running against very
similar vehicles, often the exact same type.  Most of the Porsches in
your price range won't be that comptetitive in the SCCA--at least, not
on a national level.  Locally, you might do quite well, depending on
how good the local people in the class are, and how much $$$ they've
spent on developing their cars.

	I would choose the 914.  But then, I think we knew that...
