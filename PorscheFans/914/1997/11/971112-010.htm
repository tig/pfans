I had a set on a '86 VW Golf and liked them a lot. When I got my 914,
the PO gave me a pair of new KYB's for the front end that he hadn't ever
installed. I put them in and after a few hundred miles put the Boge's
back in. I thought they were too stiff for the street.

In fact, if anyone is interested in them, I'd be happy to sell them.
Just drop me an email.
