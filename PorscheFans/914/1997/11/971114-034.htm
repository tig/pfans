Walker, 

I know Randy very well and go to the races often, he has 3 tranny's for
the race car (long track, short track and one in between) He rarely
breaks if ever. There has been problems from time to time (I think the
last Las Vegas race) but they usually dont break..All three trannys
where gone thru sometime early last year.
Do you know something I dont ??
Don
