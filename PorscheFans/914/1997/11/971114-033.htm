Since we're veering off 550s (into 904s), I'll share my dream:  a stiff tube
and
welded floor/firewall chassis that you could bolt 914 suspension, engine,
etc, to
when your old chassis finally rusts itself to death.

If such a chassis existed, several body companies might offer us a variety of
approaches - the modified autocross roadster (lightweight "funny car"
panels),
the 308-inspired targa, and the Diablo-inspired coupe.

Until then, my favorite look for a non-stock 914 is Beach Boys' Monterrey,
followed at some distance by a GT-fendered Willco-leaned-back-windshield
street
roadster.

Mike,
The 904's chassis is a bit more interesting than the "stiff tube and welded
floor-firewall" chassis you mention.  From the Shin Yoshikawa cutaway
drawings (see below for details) the 904 chassis consisted of two very large
longitudinal box section rails going all the way from the front suspension
mounts to a subframe holding the mounting points for the rear of the engine,
transmission and rear suspension.  These box section rails -- maybe four
inches tall by two inches wide -- appear built up from sheet stock.  If you
were to take an overhead look at these rails you would see them angle in at
the front suspension and, in the cockpit section, they form the outer sills
that run underneath the doors.  There appears to be a metal floor pan and
more square channel (maybe not built up like the longitudinal rails) tubing
connecting the longitudinal rails from left to right.  While maintaining the
basic Beetle and 356 "flat pan" chassis idea, this design is vastly stiffer
but still easily adaptable to a wide variety of non-structural body designs
(like those you mention above).

The Yoshikawa drawings were originally published (in the USA, at least) in
the magazine "European Car" or its precursor, VW & Porsche World.  I don't
know which issue(s).  The vintage racing magazine "Victory Lane" has, on the
back of the center insert opposite page 33 in the October '97 issue, an ad
offering posters of these and other Yoshikawa drawings, including the 550
Spyder, 904 GTS, and other Porsche, Ferrari, MB and Lotus models. No 914's...
boo!  This ad has a small copy of the 904 illustration which shows the
chassis as described above, but without enough detail to say what front
suspension is used.  Rear suspension appears to be swing axles with coil-over
shocks (i.e., not torsion bar).

BTW: everyone else rags about the 914's looks.  Aren't we, the 914 list, the
one's who're supposed to think they're already gorgeous?
