Someone emailed me about the rocker arm spacers I came up with. I'm sorry,
but I left your email address at home. Here's the original post about them.
Sorry to take up bandwidth on Porschefans.

I didn't need the 0.5mm shims, so you can probably just not order them. They
don't make 2mm shims in this diameter, so you have to use 2 of the 1mm shims
instead. 

The branch warehouses are:

Illinois: (800)221-4469
Texas: (800)527-5177
Georgia: (800)444-9560

You can call the one that's closest to you for the parts.
