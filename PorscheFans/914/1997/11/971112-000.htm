For all that shtuff to have quit working at the same time it is probably
due to loosing a ground.  Check your transmission ground strap and
check/clean your main battery ground.  Also make sure all your fuses are
seated good.

The other thing to check is, did you have anything loose in your front
or rear trunk at the time?  Something could have slid and knocked some
wires loose or be grounding a brake wire or something of that nature.
So check all your connections to your rear lights.
