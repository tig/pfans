To those who have been helping thank you very much.  My main concern is with
my constant stalling of the engine when it is cold.  

Many thought is was due to my auxilary air regulator.  However, i removed the
regulator and it didnt seem to be cloogged.  I sprayed it out with WD40 and
put it back in.  I blew through the hoses when it was colded and the air was
unrestricted.  Upon warming up the engine the valve closed.  I assume thats
how it is supposed to work, so i dont think my problem is with the auxilary
air regulator 

Any other sugestions.  Maybe its not worth it.  After the car warms it, it
runs great.  But i cant get past perfection.

Thanks
