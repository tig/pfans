To Jeff Lorentzen: Not too long ago I replaced the turn signal switch
along with the wiper switch on my 914 with the combined unit from a 924.
They were practically identical exceept that the 924 unit has the
electrical washer switch instead of our little spare tire air diverter
whatever thingie. I'm not good with proper names. Anyway I hope this
helps. At least in my area there are so many 924s in wrecking yards that
you can probably just pull a used one off a wreck without it setting you
back too much and it will probably be fully functional. One thing that
might pose a problem is that your earlier chassis has a slightly
different steering column than my '76's, which looks almost identical to
the 924's with its plastic housing and everything, so I don't know if
the switches from the 924 would be as much of a "bolt-in upgrade" as
mine was.

Marc.
