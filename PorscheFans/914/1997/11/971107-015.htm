Dirk, I don't know how to send email to you personally, but I would be
interested in the steel flares your friend has. Are they new or
take-offs? I have some take-off factory flares that are rough and rusty
but could perhaps be used by someone with the right skills. If that
interests anybody out there, let me know. By the way, I also need
factory engine sheet metal and an engine wiring harness for my six,
which I am anxious to get on the road soon. The reason why flares are
important here is that my fenders have already been cut by PO for
fiberglass flares which have since disappeared. I need to weigh my
options and follow or battle my purist instincts as to whether I should
go with the flares or weld on some other stock fenders. Anyway...
