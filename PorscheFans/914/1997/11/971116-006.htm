Hello! The 3.2 would probably be a simpler conversion because more people
have done it, but the 3.6 can be done as well, without any significant
modification to the car as well. Having done my conversion entirely myself,
I must remind you that both are big projects.

Nobody makes 914/6 sheetmetal for the 3.6, so I had to purchase 3.2 metal
and modify it to fit the 3.6. Heads are different, cam covers different, no
oil cooler. Unfortunately there are more gaps that have to be filled in
than places notched out, but isn't difficult, just time consuming. I
probably spent about 20 hours with a pair of tin snips and my Dremel making
it fit, and now that it's powercoated you can't tell the difference. It
certainly is fun adding additional grommets for things like "that set of
plugs down below". The sheetmetal is not a problem, but does require more
work that a straight 3.2 conversion.

The intake is a little tricker. Mine is out of a '91 C2 so has the aluminum
intake manifolds (pre '95). The air box must go entirely and the blower on
the opposite side must go entirely as well. Then, there are an assortment
of large, aluminum brackets that are part of the intake manifold that must
be grinded off (at least the ones at the trunk end (they hit), but might as
well remove them all). So from here you're just left with two beautiful
aluminum manifolds and no air filter/intake. No trunk cutting, yet.

Intake parts remaining to fit at this point: rubber 90 degree boot, mass
air flow sensor, air filter. For an air filter I used MSDS's cone shaped
filter, because it is supposed to be at least as good as the factory's and
is much smaller. The rubber boot provides simply a place to hold the engine
vents hoses and they would not be used any way since the oil tank is
located on the other side of the engine now, and must be removed to clear
the trunk. This rubber "boot", as I call it, does not need to be modified
other than removing these (2) external holders. Now the fun: the stock '91
(pre '95) air flow sensor will not fit without 914 modification (sob, sob).
You have a choice to mount it like it was in the C2 (kinda sits on top of
the left air intake) and have it poke through the top of the engine cover,
or, flip it over and mount half of it in the trunk. I chose to mount part
of it in the trunk cause I didn't want to ruin the 914's lines. So, to get
this flip to work, I had to cut a strip about 12 inches long and 3 inches
wid across the top of my trunk. I did preserve the top "lip" of the trunk
so the rubber still fits and the rear trunk is sealed. I was experimenting
with the parts as I did this and wouldn't be surprised if this hole could
be smaller. Then I attached a 4" long 3" diameter 45 degree bent tube to
the air flow sensor to attach the MSDS cone unit. As a result, the MSDS air
filter sits right in between the intake manifold and oil tank. Whew, it
fits, but was not a drop in procedure.

My advice, get a late model 3.6 with the plastic intake manifolds. They are
just a different shape and have a smaller, better (+27 HP) air flow sensor
and the entire intake can be mounted in a 914 without any trunk
cutting.I've seen this on a car at Patrick Motorsports (Phoenix, AZ) that
also used the MSDS air filter.

At this point, the 3.6 still doesn't fit. Only thing left is the idle speed
motor which sits way up on the motor, but can be relocated by simply
providing longer hoses to the intake and fabricating a new bracket to have
it sit about 3" to the left (drivers side) of where it originally was.

Other than the sheetmetal and intake (and I suppose electrical) it's just
like other conversions. I'm planning on putting some info on my conversion
up on my web page in a couple weeks (http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~siverson/914)
with pictures, so this may all make more sense then.

Bottom line, its pretty awesome to open a '74 914 engine lid and see a
massive 12 plug distributor squeezed in about an inch from the firewall.
Never mind the performance, this alone does it for me.

Off to Discount Tire (really),
Steve
