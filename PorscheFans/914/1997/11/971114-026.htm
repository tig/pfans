Fellow 914ers, 
A few back some of you stated you had ordered a new book entitled
"Porsche 914 & 914/6" by Brian Long. Well in todays mail I received a
sale flyer from Classic Motorbooks showing the book. I just called and
their customer service department was closed. Their hours are from
8am-4:30pm CST. Here's the following info for all:

Book part number - 125124AE
Price - $39.95
Phone # - 800-826-6600   fax 715-294-4448

I have never used them, but maybe they will have the book you all are
looking for. 

                                                         Jim Appello

mottos include:
"Object in your rearview mirror IS closer than it appears - IT'S ME, MOVE
OVER!!!"

"Thank God I moved south, 55mph was killing me"
"Life begins at 100mph" 
.
