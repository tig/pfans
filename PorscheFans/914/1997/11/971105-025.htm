Once you find the heating element supplier, with requisite wiring
instructions, I would attempt to think outside the box.

Design your own insulated heating chamber and place it as close to the
heating ducts exit chamber/orifice.  This same sort of thinking led some
genius in the early '70s to move the fuel pump from under the passenger's
butt, to the front wheel well area, as close to the fuel tank as
possible.

So, why not custom make a nice insulated heating element box that mounts
up front somewhere, maybe even hangs behind the center console gages that
connect the center tunnel to the bottom of the dash board (there is
plenty of room there!)?

This used to be called brainstorming.  Now it's called paradigm shift. 
When I was in engineering school it was simply part of the job of
engineering, THINKING about alternatives.

Let us know if you try it.

I was out for a ride with Rich Johnson (Ol' Yeller) a couple weeks ago,
and he doesn't have his heater tuber hooked up to the exchangers yet.  At
certain speeds, hot air was still sucked into the car anyway, so if you
do this, remember to cap off the original openings entering at the
firewall with something like a spraycan top and banjo clamp, or a huge
wad of Dave Darling's jalapeno flavoured gum.
