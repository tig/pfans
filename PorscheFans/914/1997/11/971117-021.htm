Someone had wondered about getting a replacement EGR valve, and since I 
have a '76, I have thought about this some.  I would guess that you could 
use one from a rabbit or a 924 or some other car and it would work.  I  
bet that if the smog tester knew what to look for, they would not pass it 
but most smog testing places do not have much info on the 914 and so you 
could probably get away with it.  I would recommend that you take it in 
for a pre-test without the EGR (or any visible remnants) because the last 
time mine was tested, they did not test the EGR at all (and it was not 
hooked up!).  If you do need a used EGR, be sure to give PartsHeaven in 
Hayward a call and also GPR.  My next test will be in one year, during 
which time I need to repair both the EGR and the smog pump (which just 
recently self-destructed).
Good Luck,

Clark Brown
