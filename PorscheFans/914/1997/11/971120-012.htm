Okay go to the news stand and pickup All About VW Performance Engines
Fall 1997 turn to page 117 and look at the bottom left picture.  Ah horse
shit, if that is not proof it can and does happen Tell me what did happen
then.  BTW for you who don't want to go and get the book it is a picture
of a broken mounting boss for the pickup.  The picture was taken at Mark
Steven's Performance.  I had the wrong article reference sorry.  But the
guys at FAT knew of the problem also, I was on the phone today with them
about a set of 103s and a few other mods they will do for me.  And they
told me the same exact thing.  It seems to me the experts are all in
agreement.  Heck I have only rebuilt about 5 of these type 4s  I am sure
FAT and Stephen's has done a lot more than I have probably pushing the
1000 mark (an understatement).  9ft. lbs. can be exceeded pretty easily,
and if you ever saw how some people bolt down there oil caps, you would
think they where used the same spec as the rear wheel nuts on a VW
224ft.lbs.  I have had to take them off with a 18" Braker bar. 

FAT builds type 4s for off road racing SCORE and used to do them for
Super-Vee, still does SCCA work for E-prod, and others.  I would trust
them with any engine part I had.  

Mark Stephen's is another highly recommended establishment.  Have not
used them yet, but I do have a set of 1.8l heads that need to have a 2.0l
flow and spark plug placement.  And am really interested in their HiPo
engine builds

Also on page # 118 I will quote " Since the main pickup assembly bolts
directly to the center cam bearning web, if the strainer plate bolt is
over tightened (and commonly is), the case boss can break off, and
leaving the pickup "high and dry." Over-torqueing this bolt can also pull
the cam bearing bore out of round, crush the center cam bearing, and even
eventually ruin the engine."
