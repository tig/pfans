>>The other project is straightening the mtg plates for my engine bar.
The bar itself is straight and listmembers gave me some good how to
advice when I inquired a couple months back. I have a helper lined up and
jacks, jackstands and all. I really need to get it vertical as it is
blocking my access to the oil filter. I've gone a couple of changes with
the same FRAM and its gotta go. I plan on taking the bolts out and
straightening the outboard mounts (unless someone has a couple of good
ones?)  and putting it all back together with new bolts and nuts.<<

Make a new bracket or get a new one.  Once the metal has been pulled and
straightened it will not have the same strength as it did originally. 
And they are not very strong to begin with!  You can easily make some
with some Steel channel and drill, a few bits and some time.  I used
3/16" wall on mine.  Used an original to make the pattern, and I now
don't fear the bolt head pulling or bending the plate. I have several
examples of the bolt pulled thru the plate.

Or you can fix yours and have them heat treated or weld in a
reinforcement plate to the original bar.

Take Care,
