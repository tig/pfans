Jeff,
    My friend built a set of wires for a twin plug 3.2L using Mallory
components.  He used the thickest Mallory wire.  He also bought a roll of
Mallory brand spark insulation.  This was expensive, but it's the hot setup
on a lot of the SCCA and IMSA (ProSportsCar) 911's we've seen.  We raced
that set of wires for 2 years, then put them in a daily driver.
Regards,
DC
'75 914 2.0L
