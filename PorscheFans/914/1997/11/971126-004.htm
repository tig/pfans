It is with sadness that I post this message.

On Tuesday November 25th, Ed Osborne lost his battle with cancer.  Ed and his
wife Melody were some of the first Members of the Porsche 914 Club, as well
as one time Members of the Owners Association.  You may remember Ed and
Melody by their 914's : "ITS NO 6" or "MO NASTY".  Ed loved 914's and the
people he had met as a result of 914 ownership, and through Club activities.

Diagnosed in the spring of '96 and given six months to live, Ed's positive
attitude and strong will helped him to live well past expectations.  The
first time I met Ed, he made me feel like an old friend, and sincerely
thanked me for my efforts to help the Club.  Ed's infectious smile and
up-beat personality will be greatly missed.

If anyone would like to send Melody a card or letter, please e-mail me
(A914Man@aol.com) and I'll forward the address.
