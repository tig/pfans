	That was indeed me.  Global Metrics in Burlingame CA has a
lot of the connectors.  They have the larger (~1/4") female spade
connectors that are used for the Aux Air Regulator (and other places),
the same thing with a "barb" which is used in the four-prong connector
on the relay board, the smaller (~1/8") barbed female spade connectors
that are used for the fuel injectors, MPS, etc., and the plastic plug
for the injectors (and anything else that has two small pins).
	I've got the part numbers around somewhere, but not with me
at the moment.
	Two of the rubber "boots" are available through Volvo and
Mercedes-Benz dealers (or presumably directly from Bosch).  I *think*
these are for the two-pin connectors and the MPS connector, but I'm
not sure.  I'll have to look that up as well.
	I cannot find a source (yet) for the round connectors inside
the T12 (twelve-pin) connector to the relay board.  I also cannot find
a source for the pins in the ECU connector.

	The round pins inside the T12 connector are a piece of cake.
You have to pry the back off the plastic connector, and the wires are
all there.  Take the pin out, and hold it with some pliers.  Apply your
soldering iron to the back of the pin, and in a moment you should be able
to pull the wire out.  Keep the heat on the pin, and you can put a new
wire into the connector just as easily.
	I have not yet had to take my ECU connector apart, so I don't
know how those pins attatch to the wires.
