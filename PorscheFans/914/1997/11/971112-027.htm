This may be a 'less-than-perfect' forum, but since the subject came up, 
what the heck does '13B' mean when describing a rotary engine? I've done 
my homework, and have perused 'The Wankel Engine' book I got from the 
library. Apparently the 'rotary' engine is more correctly called a 
'Wankel' engine, after the guy who designed it in the early '70s. Not 
that I blame anybody - who wants to proudly proclaim that their Porsche 
is driven by a fire-breathing, 200hp *Wankel* ?

Anyway, since the book was written in the early '70s, when the engine 
was big news, it doesn't contain any explanation to the modern-day 
designations like '13B'. Could somebody explain what this means, and why 
the '13B' is the best in the rotary line for the 914 conversion? My 
thoroughly uneducated guess is '13' is a displacement designation, and 
the 'B' means it's a twin rotor?
TIA

		Why, yes, ma-am, I *do* have big Wankel under the hood. :)
