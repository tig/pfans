It wasn't when new, so don't worry about it.

Yeah, use Brake Cleen, but no tin the apartment. Your significant other will
kill you...

You need an electronics-type soldering iron. Get the 35 watt one from rat
shack. First, strip the insulation about 1/2" or so on both pieces. Clean
the copper unitl it is shiny. Use Tarnex or something for this. It is very
important that the copper be very clean before attempting to solder. For the
iron, you'll need a wet spong or old rag. With the iron hot, tin the iron
with the electronics-type rosin core solder and wipe on the wet sponge. The
tip of the iron should be shiny. Get some shrink tubing of the correct
diameter from rat shack. Cut a 1" piece off and slid over one wire and up
away from the cut end of the wire. Twist the ends of the 2 pieces together
tightly so that the wire lays flat and has the orinetation it had before it
was cut. Solder the connection together. When it cools, slide the tubing
over the connection and take a lighter and wave the flame near the tubing to
make it shrink.
