Yup, it has been done.  Successfully by some.  More pros and cons.  KEP
is the place to get the engine/tranny adaptor, good luck on the engine
mount, and on it goes.  I knew 2 guys in Houston who did it and ran
successfully in SCCA & local PCA region  (they were given special
dispensation to run) events.

This thread has gone around several times, by this time it outta be
listed under the FAQs.

And while you're at it, why not put the 914 motor in an RX7 :-)

If you put a Chev 350 in a Datsun 240Z, then put a Rotary 12A in a Miata,
you could put the Miata engine in a 914, the Datsun 6 into the Chevy
Malibu, and the Type 4 into the RX7.  But wait, what if the Chev fits in
the RX7?  :-]

In my 400-picture screen saver, that gives me a continual slide show, one
of the shots is of the 911 motor in a Mooney airplane engine compartment.
 What happened to the regular airplane motor?  Someone put in a 914 ?
