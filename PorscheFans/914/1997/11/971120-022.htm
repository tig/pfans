I guess it all depends on how the ready the donor car is, but if you take
it to a shop that isn't going to rape you for working on a Porsche, it
shouldn't cost that much.  I don't have a lift or a very nice garage for
that matter, but I've pulled an engine, changed the oil cooler seals and
put it back in under 2 hours.  Throw in another 1/2 hour or so to get it
fired back up and you're in business.  Of course all this speed is a result
of practice, but I'm still trying to break an hour  :).  

Good Luck,

Dion
