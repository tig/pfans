As do we all, that's why we do what we do.

I don't know of a single person on this list that learned any way but
one. 

The hard way... :)

By digging in, and asking alot of questions. Good meterial would be the
Haynes manual, or the factory manual if you've got the money to burn.
And the P-fans list. There is also a great couple of articles on Tim's
914 page. [http://www.estinc.com/porsche]. Check the FAQ, read the tech
articles, and then when you have a problem, have at it!

All the reading in the world won't sustitute for skinned knuckled and
dirty fingernails. :) 

There _are_ dome good basic books on FI. I don't remember the Authors
name, but there's one on "Bosch Fuel Injection" and then of course there
are the Muir VW books.

I gotta get back to work...
