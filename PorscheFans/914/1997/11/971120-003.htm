Over Torqueing it is as bad as breaking it, please use a small wrench or
a torque wrench. It pulls on the center cam bearing web, thus pulling it
out of round and destroying the engine over time.  And when done you may
have to toss the case as well as the camshaft.  Plus as usual your
mileage will vary.  This info is straight from FAT Performance.  As other
have said, you break it you bought it. 

BTW, Hot VDubs had a engine special issue out this fall, that had a build
of a FAT 2.8 Type IV Class V SCORE off road engine.  With a single 48
webber this thing put out 161hp.  But remeber the engine is built for
torque and longevity.  This piece of trival information was in that
article.  It is not to trival is it!  Ahhh, there are some other bits and
pieces of info in this article.  Interesting reading, but not the bible
of type-4 engine building.

Take Care,
