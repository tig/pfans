It sounds like the hose your describing goes to the Manifold Pressure
Sensor.  I've never replaced any of my hoses with anything close to
stock, and so far I haven't had any problems with them.  You'll
definitely want to get that hose replaced, though, since the MPS is
probably the most important component of the FI system.  (The D-Jet is
also known as MPC, and the MP doesn't stand for Military Police...)
Now, as far as your hiccup is concerned, the most likely suspect is your
throttle position switch.  It's a little black plastic box mounted on
the side of your throttle body.  You can try re-adjusting it following
the directions in the 914 Workshop manuals, or if someone else on the
list can remember the process, you can avoid spending $400+ on the
manuals.  There's no guarantee that adjusting it will solve the problem,
so if I'm not mistaken, you might be able to pry it open and clean the
contacts inside.  If that doesn't do it, then you'll need to replace it.
I think they're around $80 each.

Hope this helps!
