Somebody out there said something to the effect that European 914s used
the magnesium case. I don't think this is true. The engine in question
has a serial number starting with a V. My recollection and my spec book
show that the earliest 914s have W engine code engines and I see no
reason for Porsche to differentiate the case material simply for the
home market. I still contend that the engine case was out of a very
early 411 (when did they start production?), in any case an application
from before the first 914 rolled off the line. Magnesium cases would be
fine for an engine close to stock, but I wouldn't use them for a big
performance rebuild. Porsche found that there were limits to the size
they could build an engine around a magnesium case with their 2.7
motors, but then factors like thermal reactors also led to the 2.7's
demise. If I remember right, Porsche's (and Vw's) reason for making
cases out of magnesium was economy. Magnesium apparently was easier and
cheaper to cast?
