This is apparently a common problem with the type 4 heads from what I've
read.   Mark Stephens High Performance and AVP have supposedly developed a
method of fixing this problem in their rebuilds, more involved than just
swaging them in.  I think the Mark Stephens ads offer a 100k mile
guarantee.  I haven't had them rebuild anything yet but planning to do it
with my 2.0L when I get to the engine pulling stage.

Hello,
I've been plagued with a nasty sort of problem
due to, I believe age (not me, my cars. .) :]
I have two 914 2.0 engines each that dropped
an intake valve seat out of the head bore.
This sucks because it holds the valve open
and you lose a cylinder. . .it can be a complete
drop, or a partial with a canted seat, I have both!
Oh, that makes a wonderful conundrum. .
My dilemma, it would seem, is that the local machine
shops think it is ok to swage the seat back in by beating
the material around the seat bore with a rectangular
drift punch. . Aack!  The factory installs these by heating the
head, and chilling the seat and just dropping them in.
After many years of use (23 in my case), time takes its
toll and undoes what the factory so fitfully did.
My question; is there a better way?
