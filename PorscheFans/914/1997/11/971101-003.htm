In response to Ed's comment on the quality of work done by Mark Stephen's
I'ld have to say they have done a great job in rebuilding or repairing six
sets of 2.0L heads in the last 18 months.
Now the issue of damage to his conmustion chamber is concerning. I'ld
personally ask Bill or Mark for a core exchange and let them peddle the
slightly damaged head.  If what was sent was damaged they are responsible for
reparing or correcting the situation (refund if desired).
They have been a great source for head work for me and I hate to think they
are dropping their attention to detail for some reason.  In the Dallas Texas
area the availability of performance headwork on T4 heads is zip unless you
can afford 2K for a set of heads from someone like Rare/Morrison.
For whatever its worth Ed I am going to inquire to Bill as to this incident
and will report back to the list the results of our conversation.
