A very sound approach. You should also specify what type of preperation
you feel you can do. Both technically speaking, and financially. And
yes, this is an ideal forum to ask. You also should really try the
national autox list. autox@autox.team.net

Well lets start with your two suggestions first. The 914. A car that's
more fun than a barrel full of drunk monkeys. However, because of it's
success, the 914 has been classed very hard in SCCA Solo2. In the stock
category, it can be fun for local level competition, but will never be
nationally competetive in B-Stock. The Miatas are just too damn quick.
In Street-Prepared, the jury's still out, but it's looking grim. I'm
trying, and will be for a few more years and kilobucks at this rate.

The RX-7. No, it's not a P-car. But it is a great car to play with. I
see a few advatages that the RX-7 has over the 914 (loathe as I am to
admit it). Cost, a good RX-7 is alot cheaper than a good 914. And parts
can be had at a very nice discount. Mazda Competition will sell you
factory parts at a substantial discount as long as you can prove to them
that you are indeeed competing with the car. Shiftless autoxer. One of
the glorious things about the rotary engine is the nearly linear
powerband and then luxury of an ungodly high redline. More raod racing
oportunities coming up for the RX-7. Namely the spec RX-7 class that is
coming up in SCCA roadracing. As for autox, in C-Stock it's a very good
autoxer, and has the potential to be quite competetive. There really are
only two other cars in the class that I would nod an advantage to. The
2nd Gen Toyota MR2, and the Porsche 924S. In street Prepared, the RX-7
can trully shine. With the unlimited intake and exhaust rule, a stock
rotary with normal aspiration is capable of 230+hp. I've driven one, and
it was a kick. But they require alot of development. Street Prepared is
an expensive class, and the word "street" really doesn't apply any more.

But there are other really great cars out there. As mentioned earlier,
the RX-7 is not a P-car. So, let's look at the
not-quite-so-rediculously-expensive P-cars that do have a potential in
the SCCA stock classes.

The 944S2, yes it's a wasser-pumper, but it's also a really great car.
And is also ideally suited for drivers ed as well. That's in A-stock
against the M3 and 911s.

The 924S. I personally think this is the best car for C-stock. If not,
then running a very close second to the MR2. It has gobs of torque and
low end power, and has a very well balanced layout. Not to mention the
optional suspension package which gives you all kinds of adjustability.
You will certainly have a harder time finding the right one though
(there aren't many). And you will need the M030 otion package for sure.
But this is also a great car for drivers ed.

Other cars? Well in Street Prepared, you can probably have a streetable
VW scirocco or golf. Or a fiat X1/9 for that matter. The X1/9 is _the_
car for D-Street Prepared, and it's mid-engined too! :) Just prepare to
have NO POWER. You think the 914 in under powered? Yeeshh. :P

> You get the picture.  Anyone want to help a poor lost soul?

Well, I hope this helps some. I personally think that getting a P-car
for autox is a great idea. For no other reason than you get to play with
the two largest amateur car clubs in the US. The only drawback I see to
P-cars in SCCA competition. Cost. P-cars are, with little argument,
expensive to maintain. And porsche doesn't really seem to sponsor
grassroots level motorsports like alot of other manufacturers do (Mazda
and Chrysler come to mind).
