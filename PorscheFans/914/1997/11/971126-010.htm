	Why is a side-shifter tranny "unfortunate"?  Or is this a typo?
(If the engine mounting bar is a straight, solid bar, you have a tail-
shifter.  If the bar is somewhat curved and has a big hole cast into it
off-center, you have a side-shifter.)
	I've replaced most of the bushings on my side-shifter linkage
several times.  They're easy and pretty straightforward, with the excep-
tion of the firewall bushing.  I'm told that one is "a pain" to do with
the engine in the car--I think you have to pull the front shift rod out
of the car to do it.
	I haven't replaced my set-screws yet, since mine look fine to me.
Dirk likes to be much more thorough than I do--and it definitely won't
hurt to replace 'em.  Just make sure that they are screwed *all* the way
in when you're done.  One of the times that I had a lot of slop in the
linkage, I found that I had installed one of the joints slightly cockeyed.
The set-screw was tight at that point, but wasn't nearly flush.  Working
the shifter back and forth loosened up that joint and resulted in a *lot*
of slop.
	If you have a 72 with a side-shifter, the firewall bushing is a
special piece not available from the dealer.  It has a bigger OD than the
bushing for the stock side-shifter cars (73+), and a smaller ID than the
bushing for the stock tail-shifter ones (70-72).
	I have never dealt with a tail-shifter car, so I don't know how
easy or tough it is to replace the bushings on one.

	To restate what everyone else has said--the 901 gearbox (which was
developed in the VERY early 60s) was a four-speed racing gearbox with a
very low 1st gear tacked on.  This was simply to get the car rolling in
pit lane.  If you look at the design of the tranny, 1st is cantilevered
off the end of the main shaft--only supported on one side.  It was not
intended to be used for much of anything, and is very nearly an after-
thought.
