Hi again P-nuts,

Here is the info taken from the magnesium type 4 case.  The top of the 
case has the numbers V 006039. This number looks like it has been 
stamped with a hand punch. The V looks like it has been striken twice 
ie. a double image. One case half has the numbers AS41, 021101102D, and 
the other half has the numbers AS41, 0211101101B.  I would appreciate 
any information on the possible origin of this case.  I know that the 
mag. case is not as strong as the regular aluminium type 4 case but does 
anyone think this case to be a desirable one.  It is sooo much lighter 
than than the aluminium. TIA

Michel

Hey P-fans,

At the last Pamona Swap meet a friend of mine purchased a magnesium
Type IV case.  Does anyone know where this case may have come from?
TIA

Michel

Wow! You found one! I always heard rumors that early VW 411s had
magnesium cases but have never seen one. My SuperVee, with its VW
industrial division type IV engine, has an aluminum case, but then it
was built, I believe, in '72. No 914 to my knowledge, has a
magnesium-cased engine, so the case has to be from, what, a '69 411?
