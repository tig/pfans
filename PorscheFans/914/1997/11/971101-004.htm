I recently had to have my tranny redone (something about trying to deal
with hills without first gear told me it was time), and when I got the
tranny put back in the car, the car didn't want to start.  So, it was
back to having fun with the electrical system.

I can now get the car to crank pretty well, but in the process, I've
noticed that I no longer hear the injection system priming the cylinders.
This is a '71 1.7L engine (d-jet) in a '74 body.  I've tried jumpering
power directly from the battery to a couple points on the relay board and
attached cables that should get the fuel pump to go, but I don't hear
anything except for an occasional weak-sounding pump when I make one
particular connection.

Here's what I've tried:

battery + to pin III on the relay/regulator board (where the mostly
square plug with the 4 white wires attaches at the driver's side rear
corner of the board) - no effect.

battery + to pin 14 on the cable that plugs into the front edge of the
relay/regulator board - no effect.

I certainly expected applying power to pin 14 of the cable would have
started the fuel pump running.  I was hoping power to pin III of that
square plug would have triggered the 1-2 second priming that you normally
get when you start turning the key, but that didn't happen.  Can anyone
give me a hint as to what to try next?

One last thing, in case it's relevant to the problem: I think the
alternator is going bad.  Before the latest batch of electrical problems
(when the injection system would prime but I couldn't get the starter to
crank), the alternator warning light was on constantly when the car was
running.  I'm hoping to get the car running again long enough to get it
to a friend's garage and do the alternator swap there.
