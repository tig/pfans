It's easier just to pull the engine and tranny as a unit. I mean, it's 4
bolts, a couple of axles, a shifter, and some misc. stuff and it's out! Then
you should clean the whole thing like crazy. Everything is easier with the
motor out. Might as well replace the clutch while you're in there, it's
probably oil fouled by now anyway.

When you re-do the gaskets in the transmission, you MUST pay attention to
the number and size of the gasaskets between the intermediate plate and the
main housing. These determine part of the ring and pinoin clearance and are
very important.
