Hey guys,
This is the third time that I've sent this message, I haven't seen it on the
list yet. First I would like to thank Rich Johnson for his reply and for
getting
involved. By the way, I bought my 5-lug upgrade, front & rear from Rich, he
is
a great guy and I would reccommend him highly to anyone on the list. Secondly
I would like to thank Bill from Mark Stephens for calling me, after Rich
called him, to find out what was wrong with the heads that I had purchased
and how he could correct it. I explained why I was upset, (a machine cut in
the combustion chamber that is not supposed to be there) and that I was very
disappointed with their heads. He seemed surprised to hear about the notch in
the combustion chamber. Anyhow I am returning the head today and he will
replace it with another. He said he would do whatever it took to satisfy me.
That seems fair enough. Mistakes happen, perhaps the sales person who sent
this head is new or not   that knowledgeable about machine work? Who knows.
I'm giving them a second chance in good faith, but I do have a pretty good
feelng about this. I will give a post on this again when it is all settled
and let you know how it turned out.

Thanks,
Ed Villela
