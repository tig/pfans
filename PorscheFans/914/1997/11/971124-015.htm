That would be me. 

I currently run on 225/50-14 BFG R1s on a 14x6 wheel with 4-7/8
backspacing. Under _stock_ fenders. The only interference I get is under
heavy lateral loading the inner sidewall rubs on the fender wall. And in
reverse the outer shoulder _may_ rub on the fender lip, it depends on
ride height.

I chose the 14s as an experiment to see if the gearing would be more to
my advantage, but now I'm thinking that a 15" would be preferable. Too
many hits on the rev-limiter for my tastes.
