	Gee, I'd forgotten just how much I hated replacing the fuel
pump.  Not only do you net to mess with all the hoses and such, but
there are also the REALLY ANNOYING hard-to-get-to nuts attatching
the pump's bracket onto the rubber isolator mounts.  Yech!
	I finally gave up trying to put the washers and star lock-
washers on, and just settled for the nuts themselves.
	Then I had to re-do the electrical connector, because in
all of the messing about, I broke one of the wires off (at the con-
nector end, of course!).  Ugh.  Not a job that I am terribly fond
of.  Especially with a FULL 16-gallon tank of gas.  Especially
putting one of the clamps on the wrong fuel hose.  ("Gee, why isn't
the flow stopping?  There can't be *that* much gas in the lines on
the engine...")  My hands still smell faintly of gasoline...
	But, it's a brand-new pump, and the critter runs once again,
after sitting for a week.  >whew!<
