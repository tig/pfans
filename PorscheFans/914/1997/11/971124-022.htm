What's the difference?  Whether a 914 center is used versus a generic center?

If someone intends to use 914 wheel bolts (or Porsche nuts on studs), I think
they're stuck with 914 centers.
If your answer related to widening (by cutting and patching 1.5" of rim into) the
914 rim versus having a new 7" rim welded to the 914 center, then I'd agree -
he's much more likely to be happy with the new rim on the 914 center than a
cut-and-pasted rim.

Which did you mean?  Or did I miss your meaning entirely?

I have a similar problem in finding wide wheels for my Dakota - the stock Dodge
6-on-4.5" centers are scarce even to have wide rims welded onto, so I may have to
go to a generic (e.g., the old white 8-spoke wheels) center just to find
something that will fit.
