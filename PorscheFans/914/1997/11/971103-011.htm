I replaced the cable on my '76 2.0, and found it to be easier than I had
originally figured it would be.  If you've got a center console, then
you'll need to remove it, and you'll need to remove the cushion/storage
compartment in-between the two seats.  This is pretty straightforward,
as all of the screws are visible and readily accessible.  Then, remove
the 3 or 4 screws that hold the speedometer and tachometer in place, and
gently tilt all of the gauges back.  In order to get the drive cable off
of the speedometer, I needed to remove my steering wheel, but yours may
be easier.  Gently push the old cable down from under the dash, and
after lifting the "tabs" that hold all of the wires in the center
channel down, pull it out from under the car.  Then, slide your new
cable in.  If you've got another person that can watch for the cable and
pull it up when it comes through the tunnel, it will go much smoother.
Simply lay the new cable along the route taken by the old one, hook it
up to the speedometer, and put everything back together.  I didn't
replace the angle drive, so I can only offer advice on the cable itself,
but as I recall the job was fairly intuitive and straightforward.

Good luck!
