Hey David, we talk again:

Yeah, I miss Joe.  I went through some ugly employment times while in
Houston, when the oil company I worked for went bankrupt, the bankruptcy
caused the president/owner to die of a heart attack because his
fraudulent treatment of his employees was too much guilt for his heart,
and we had to live through an employee class action suit against that
company.  We won on paper but we lost in our personal finances / net
worth, big-time.  It cost us all in time, personal energy, and personal
bank accounts.  Through that whole time, one of the things that helped
keep my sanity was the kindness of the three guys David mentioned above. 
I spent many hours hanging around Sam's shop, playing gopher for Bill
(with his then-brown 911 racer) or Joe, while my poor car sat inside my
trailer outside of Sam's (who was so kind as to let me even park it there
during this down time).

Well David, Sam knows this, and I might as well tell you.  Besides the 5
large framed posters in my office, I have a Sam Shalala shrine in the
corner of my office at work :-)  I have one of his rear tires
(25.5X12.0-16 Goodyear) off #58 (from Sebring '93 - where he borrowed my
trailer to make the event), mounted on furniture rollers, with a nice
coffee table-quality round glass on top of it.  Many pictures of the car
in action & stills, framed on the wall, and a Polymer Dynamics teflon
coated piston out of his engine, on the table.  PolyDyn is in the process
of getting me the latest shot of Sam's car in poster size too.  Now
here's a twist.  Back when I was shagging things for those guys, Sam had
Frank Beard (ZZ Top) driving with him.  I ended up working for some
friends who own an interior decorating company there in Houston, and
ended up doing the installation of the decorations on Frank & Debbie's
new house in Richmond, as the last job I did before I moved here for
work.  Frank and Sam have long since gone their own ways, but those were
memorable times for me, including Joe as an integral part; again, I miss
him.
