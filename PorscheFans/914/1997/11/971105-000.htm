Since we're talking about 914s and RX7s in the same car forum, what
about just combining the two cars? What I mean is the transplant of an
RX7 rotary engine in a street 914. Anyone familiar with this conversion?
I believe it has been done before. What are the pros and cons? Anyone?
I've been seeing later model RX7s in the local pick your part type
wrecking yards and it's been making me think about the possibilities. It
seems a more feasable (and modest) conversion than shoving a Chevy in
the 914, to me at least. It's been my impression that the ol' Wankel
engines are a little tough on the clutches, but other than that, I don't
know. The other conversion that sounds mighty attractive right now is
the Subaru flat six boxer(which I hear was designed by Porsche) for the
914. Ah well, just dreaming.
