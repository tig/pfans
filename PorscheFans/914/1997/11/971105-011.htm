There are a couple that come to mind for me. First, your tranny may not like
being revved to 9 grand. It wasn't designed for that service, so you'd
better get it blueprinted if you do the swap. Second, the stock rotary motor
doesn't have that much power (maybe 150hp for later ones), and not much
torque at low revs. So, you will abuse the clutch a little and why bother
unless you get significanlty more power? (like 200hp) Finally, there's the
smog test issue, since it's a newer engine it'd have to pass later specs,
which limits what you can do with the motor to make more power and you'd
have to keep the cat. 

To me, the best swap is still an early 70's 911 motor.
