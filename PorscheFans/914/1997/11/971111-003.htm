After talking with Dirk and Bill last night on the IRC (log on to any
DAL.NET server on Monday nights, then go to #914chat), I think I might
have a pretty good idea as to the culprit behind all of my problems.
The big clue is that the spark appears to be great when the engine is
cold, but after it warms up, it turns dim and orange.  I was describing
how my coil is hooked up to Dirk and Bill, and when I said that there
was a red wire going from the bottom of the Aux. Air Valve to the + side
of the coil, Dirk responded in such a fashion as to lead me to believe I
might be onto something: 

DirkW: "What!?"

I took a closer look today, and here's what I'm seeing.  There are two
wires on the - side of the coil:  One is from the Crane Cams unit, and
the other is from the wiring harness, which, if I trace it back, appears
to go to the biggest connector on the relay board.  There are three
wires on the + of the coil:  One of them follows the - wire back to the
relay board, one is from the Crane Cams unit, and the last one is from
the Aux. Air Valve.  I'm assuming that the Aux. Air valve is getting
it's power from + side of the coil, and is somehow screwing the coil up
once it closes.  I don't know enough about how this works, but I'm
gathering that either way, this isn't where the Aux. Air Valve should be
getting it's power from.  So, I guess I've just got two questions:

1.  Where should the wire from the Aux. Air Valve go?
2.  I though that the tachometer was hooked up to the coil somehow...
what am I missing?  Mine works fine...

If you can offer any insight into these problems, please do so!

Thanks again!
