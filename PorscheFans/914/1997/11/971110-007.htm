Hi 914 guys 'n gals.

Good news and bad news.

GOOD NEWS
Dr. Damp Dave Darling made his trip to the DFW area successfully this
last weekend, while Rich Johnson, Jim Meyer and I were able to get
together with him for a fun visit yesterday.  None of us being native
Texans didn't hinder us from showing good Ol' Texas southern hospitality
to Dave.  True to his name, Damp Dave had the pleasure of riding in Rich,
and then Jim's 914s, IN THE RAIN.  We haven't had rain for weeks, until
DAMP Dave arrived : - )  It's kinda fun to meet someone you've posted
long distance for quite a while.  Especially someone with the auspicious
reputation of Dave.

BAD NEWS
As the post-header "Subject" indicates, I sent two posts to the 914 list
last week entitled, "Dr. Suess" & "Let The Games Begin".  I received a
very kindly corrective message from  "dem@haphazard.com", and I received
another message where I ticked off  "cstrat@tulsa.com" just a little.

Sorry folks.  "dem@haphazard.com" was more instructive, in that I wasn't
aware of protocol - again, thanks for your kindness and avoidance of
flames.

I had never given it any thought that there was a special place for
"joke" exchanges (i.e. the _tavern_ group).  I only communicate on the
914 non-digest forum, and I'm pretty e-illiterate otherwise.  The
"Flamers" group doesn't interest me at all, as I have plenty of that to
deal with at work all day long, so why read more of it, when I'm more
interested in my favorite vehicle : - )  And, I don't read any of the
other groups either, even when one of my best friends in on the 924/944
group.

When I post something, my personal rules of etiquette are:  1- Is it
something I'd also say to the person (people) in a face to face setting?
& 2- (Considering myself a pretty thick-skinned Christian) is it
something that my VERY sensitive Christian friends would read and
understand (this goes for any particular religious predilection)?

Obviously, I passed the first rule, but I failed the second rule when it
came to  "cstrat@tulsa.com".  Sorry Sir.  Since we 914ers are all
friends, I am not interested in stepping on toes.  Sometimes it might
help if we COULD see each other face to face, so we could more easily
judge the intentions of the communicators.  But, that's an impossibility,
considering that we're spread all over the face of the earth.  So, one in
a while we have the occasional mistake like I exhibited.

An interesting point that "dem@haphazard.com" brought up was the nature
of the e-snow ball I tossed in "Let The Games Begin".  I had NOT thought
of it as a "chain letter", as he suggested.  I was just thinking of
letting everyone have some fun, and giving the possibility to toss one
around as winter drug on.  Point well taken though, and thanks for
pointing that out.  I guess I'm too nice, and I avoid looking for and
finding the sinister intent of so many posts.

Now that I'm appraised of the proper forums to vent my expressions in, I
promise, I'll be a good boy now :-)

Again, sorry guys 'n gals, hope I didn't cause you too much personal
discomfort.

Back to 914ing.
