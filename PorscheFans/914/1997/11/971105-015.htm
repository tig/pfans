Good point. If you're going for an RX-7 then figure out what eactly you
want to do with it first. If it's Solo2, then get a GSL-SE, no other
model will do. It has the larger 13B motor, the fuel injection, and the
limited slip. If you want cheap road racing, then a GSL. The spec
classes are gaining popularity with RX-7s and don't allow the 13B or
injection.
