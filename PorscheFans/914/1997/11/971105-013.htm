Yes, it's been done. But we're talking about a specific competition
structure, SCCA Solo2. And you're talking about a major engine
transplant. That is only legal in the top modified classes. The interest
was for a streetable and competetive car. The Mod classes are very big
bucks, because almost anything goes, and any car that is ultimately
competetive in D or E Mod, will certainly not be a very streetable car.

Why not a Porsche flat six and shed all that extra weight and worry of a
radiator and cooling jackets.
