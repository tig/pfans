I don't think that the names (12A, 13B, etc.) have too much to do with
the actual motors configuration, but there might be something.  If I
remember correctly, a 12A is a 1.1 liter two-rotor wankel that develops
100 HP and 105 ft/lb of torque with carbs.  The 13B is a 1.3 liter
two-rotor wankel that develops around 135 HP and 140 ft/lb of torque.
Then, I think there's also a 20B or 20G or something like that which is
supposed to be a 2.0 liter three-rotor.  One of these was run out at the
salt flats... it had 3 29 psi turbochargers, and was developing 936
HP... out of 2.0 liters!  Mazda also used the 13B in the second
generation Rx7 Turbo IIs, which made approx. 200 HP with a single turbo,
and they used it again in the last generation Rx7s with two sequential
turbo chargers that made 255 HP.  These motors are incredibly flexible,
as Josh has mentioned.  600 HP out of a 3rd generation twin turbo 13B is
not unheard of at all.  Now, *that* would be fun in a 914!
