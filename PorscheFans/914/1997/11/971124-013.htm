	Fuses first.  I forget which ones (I think there are two in
series) are the right ones, just check them all--with an ohmmeter.  The
914 fuses can *look* OK but still be bad.
	Headlight switch next.  You can remove the knob on the end by
unscrewing it, then un-screw the flat "nut" that holds it into the dash.
Pull out the fuse panel (two screws) and/or the combination gauge (the
left-side gauge in the dash) to get your hands on the switch itself.
Then check the wires going into it.  The black-with-blue-tracer wires
are the ones going to the instrument lights.  I forget which one is power
in for those--check the Haynes wiring diagrams.  Check for 12V when the
lights are on.

	Two sources for that signal--one is the switch on the brake
master cylinder.  On some cars, there is a button on the side of the M/C
that you push to turn off that light.  If you know what you're looking
for, you can see it without removing anything.  If you don't know what
you're looking for, it may be best to remove the steering rack cover.
	The button has a convex rubber cover on it; just push on that
and you should feel the button being depressed.
	The other source for the signal is the button underneath the e-
brake handle.  If the handle is gone, you'll have to find some way to
keep that button pressed or the light will stay on.  Other problems in
these circuits can also cause the light to come on, but the buttons are
the most likely culprits.

	No clue.
