     914er's
     
        One area where it actually costs more to own a 914 than a 911 is 
     when you need to replace your rubber seals! This crime is rooted in 
     the unfortunate fact that only 100,000 914's were built, but 911s were 
     built in numbers approaching 1 million!  Unfortunately, the parts bin 
     raiding of the Porsche 914 designers didn't include utilization of 911 
     or VW product seals (or for that matter, most parts in the car!) so we 
     are stuck with a unique model. 
     
         There are OEM parts available from all the dealers and Porsche 
     Parts houses, and there are Taiwanese/Chinese replicas available from 
     many of the same sources.  Seal kits for the entire car using OEM 
     parts are in the $1500-2000/set range...however, they will fit the 
     first time and last. Parts for 911's however are often in the $600-800 
     range for the entire car!
     
        Reports made on the now deceased Porschephiles list concluded that 
     the 'replicas' were generally all hit and miss, some fitting perfectly 
     the firts time, many needing returns because they were too short, many 
     needing "surgery" to shorten them in order to fit.  Replicas are 
     generally priced about 1/2 to 3/4 of OEM parts. Quality of the rubber 
     was also reported as hit or miss.
     
        Alternatives????   Page through a J.C. Whitney catalogue in the 
     rubber seals section.  Your mouth will water when you see the 
     selection of cross sections and the very inexpensive price /foot, with 
     most being American Quality.  Continue looking carefully for the cross 
     section that matches a 914 part....keep looking.....keep 
     looking....can't find any? You got it baby!
     
     Mop up the tears before you write the big check so the ink won't 
     smudge to your local Porsche Parts dealer.  Oh you wan't seals?  
     
     turbo prices for beetle seals.
     
     
     yes, I've been spanked!
