WOW , Been-there

	The factory says you can not reinsert a "seat", my shop tried to
do it and it fell out about 3 weeks later. 
	The shop then reinserted it and pinned it in, and it has stayed
in. Now this show was an old time VW type 1-4 shop, so they knew what
they were doing. 

	The overall bet path is to ship them to RIMCO in Cal. They will
rebuild the head and put new seats in and then bake it. Last time I sent
a set out it cost $100 each to rebuild.

	BTW: what is happening is the guides are worn and the guide to
stem gap is too wide, so the valve get hot and stretches , then it
starts pounding on the seat irregularly (think of it as a bent valve ),
and that knocks the seat out. I have found that forged pistons can be
cleaned up with a dermer tool and re-used if you did not hole it or
crack the skirt.

	Hello,

	I've been plagued with a nasty sort of problem
	due to, I believe age (not me, my cars. .) :]

	I have two 914 2.0 engines each that dropped
	an intake valve seat out of the head bore.
	This sucks because it holds the valve open
	and you lose a cylinder. . .it can be a complete
	drop, or a partial with a canted seat, I have both!
	Oh, that makes a wonderful conundrum. .

	My dilemma, it would seem, is that the local machine
	shops think it is ok to swage the seat back in by beating
	the material around the seat bore with a rectangular
	drift punch. . Aack!  The factory installs these by heating the
	head, and chilling the seat and just dropping them in.
	After many years of use (23 in my case), time takes its
	toll and undoes what the factory so fitfully did.

	My question; is there a better way?
