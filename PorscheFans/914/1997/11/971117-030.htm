Hey, they were bred to be race cars. :)

Well, not exactly. Toe in at the rear will help for high speed power-on
stability, as well as helping to control ay oversteer characteristics
you might be fighting. Toe out at the rear will make the car much
looser, and although sometimes preferable, can get you into a spin in a
hurry.

Ok, here's the very basics.

Front:

Toe - Adjust for more rapid turn in at the cost of straightline (eg.
freeway) stability. This may sound bad, but only if you like to fall
asleep at the wheel. And you're in a Porsche! Why, or how, would you
ever fall asleep at the wheel in a Porsche.:)

Camber - Negative camber, increase your negative camber for added grip
under lateral loading. At the cost of very minimaly diminished braking
ability and added wear to the inner edge of the tire.

Caster - Increase the caster for added *in-turn* negative camber. This
is different than static negative camber. Always put in as much caster
as you can. The only side effect of lots of caster is the car will tend
to self-center the wheel more strongly than before.

Rear:

Toe - Toe in for higher speed stability, Toe out to increase the amount
oversteer.

Camber - same priciple as the front.


These are very crude and basic priciples to alignment settings and every
adjustment you make to these will effect the whole dynamic system. And
I'm sure others will have additional comments to make. But as for oem
specs? Well, they were designed with the current tire technology of the
time in mind. Tires have gotten ALOT better since then. And as such can
handle a good deal more than tires 25 years ago could. For long life
from your tires though, don't deviate too far from the oem. Everything
that increases performance, will probably have some kind of a negative
impact on your wallet. In this case, added tire wear.

What do I run?

Front:

1.5 degrees negative camber
6 degrees caster 
3/32" toe out

Rear:

1.25 degrees negative camber
3/32" toe in
