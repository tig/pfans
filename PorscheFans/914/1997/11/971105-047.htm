Well, the RX-7 does have decent brakes, but the pedal feel is minimal
and it's hard to control the axle hop under heavy braking unless you
have an adjustable bias. As for the 914 having great brakes? Nah. Try a
1st gen MR2. Now that car has brakes! No offense to big ol' 911 brake
setups, but I got to drive one at an autox once and when I went for the
brakes at what I felt was a good braking zone, I damn near came to dead
stop. I had to get back on the gas just to get back up to my turn in
point. Now that's brakes! Yeah, the 1st gen MR2 would be a great autoxer
if it just weren't so damn heavy!
