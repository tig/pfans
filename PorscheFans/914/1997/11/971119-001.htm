   If memory serves, the D+ and B+ outputs on the stock setup are
identical in wire gauge, which means that you have a problem.   Any
measurements that you make externally to the alternator at the relay
box end of the wires will be incapable of distinguishing between
these two leads.  The only difference between them is the current
handling capability of the diodes that feed the D+ and B+ leads...
the D+ lead is the field current source and has smaller diodes than
the B+ lead, which is the main output, but the only way to tell the
difference is to hook it up and try it; if the alternator fries, you
had the two leads reversed.   (By the way, if the battery is fully
charged and the other electrical system loads are kept light, this
might not happen for quite a while, so don't assume that you got it
right if you don't see instant failure.)
   If you remove the alternator from the the vehicle, then you can
remove the air director cap on the back of the thing and then observe
the markings on the back of the alternator, which should be cast into
the case metal.   Removing one lead from the back of the alternator
will then enable you to determine which is which at the other end
with a simple ohmmeter check.
   Otherwise, you have only one choice: gamble.

					Good Luck,
                                                            Jim T.
