<< I am trying to mount a Recaro SPG in my 914 and would like to hear if
 anyone has done anything similar to this.  I have a race 914 with not back
 padding or any interior piece, I've tried to use to original slider / track
 and have success mounting the seat, but the problem is I am 6'0 tall and
 the seat is just too high.  I am trying to figure out a way to mount it so
 I can still slide it back and forth.  All those who are familiar with the
 914 knows that there is a cross brace (beam) that goes left to right in the
 middle of the floor pan.  Please help.

Hi I put OMP race seats in my 914-6, and the seat retailer sold universal 
seat rails/sliders that are very flat.  You can then easily fabricate small 
brackets to mount the sliders to the cross bar and rear floor.  Costs a
little
more but you dont have much choice if you want to be able to slide the 
seat.
