Hey Guys,

In my quest to learn more about my fuel injection and hopefully establish why
it has a rough idle when it is cold, there have been a few other problems
that have arose.

I still have this idle problem when I start the car when the engine is cold.
 The car fires for a second or two, then it dies.  Many have thought it was
my auxilary air regulator, but after running a few tests, I found that the
regulator works just fine.

The next problem refers to the idle speed after it is warm.  Before I state
the specific problem, let me tell you what I did before the problem arose.  I
was reading my 914 manuals and tooling with the FI system.  I decided to take
out the injectors to be sure they were injecting.  Anyhow, that seemed to go
fine, but upon putting the injectors back in, I noticed that I was missing
one of the rubber bushings, the rubber piece that sticks on the end of the
injector which evidently holds it in place.  Im not sure if it just fell off
while I took the injectors out or not, but I looked all over the place and
couldn't find it anywhere.  So I put the injectors back in without any
problem except that bushing, and now when the engine is warm the car idles
over 2000rpm.  This morning when i went out, I had to warm the car up with my
foot before leaving or it would stall (same problem i've had for weeks) and
when it warmed up, it idled above 2000.  Upon driving it a little, the idle
did come down but only to around 1700.  I adjusted the idle speed on the
computer, but that only brought it down to 1500.  It idles low when cold, and
now way high when warm!

Another strange problem that must all be related is now the car "coughs".  It
makes these popping noises when it is running.  None of these problems seem
to effect how the car drives though.  Yesterday when the car first started
this cough, it was spitting out some black liquid.  Im not sure if it was oil
or not, but it isnt spitting anymore.  

Im sure i have left out some little details, but that is the jist of my
problems.

Thanks,
