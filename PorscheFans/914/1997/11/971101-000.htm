Ed,
    Sorry about your problems with MSP.  I read the same magazine articles
you did.  They are willing to make it right, your said?  That would be good
enough for me.  Give them a chance to make it right.

    BTW, what exactly did you ask them to do to your heads?  Selfishly, I
don't want to ask for what you got.  Other than Stuttgart Racing in Ohio
(great 6-banger work), I don't know who I'd use/trust.  I'll be rebuilding a
1.8 next winter and I was planning on using MSP.
Dave

>Hi all, I just recieved a pair of re-built 1.8L heads from Mark Stephens. I

>referred them saying that they do great head work. Well anyway I open the
box

that
>I took out has a section notched out of the combustion chamber. It is right
>next to the exhaust valve. It looks like the valve seat cutter was in the
>wrong place and cut a circular wedge out of the edge of the combustion
>chamber. I measured the notch with a mic. and estimate that it would
probably
>be equivalent to .5cc. That would make cc-ing the heads a bit more
difficult.
>The real issue is that I cannot believe that a reputable service would even
>ship this out like this. A bright shinny fresh machine cut mistake!! There
>are various pits and gouges in the rest of the chambers, probably not a big
>deal , but with this other problem it makes me question the quality of the
>rest of their work. I called them today and the said to send the head back
>with a note explaining why I don't like it, and that they will replace it
>with another. They did not seem to want to refund my money and forget the
>whole thing, although I would.I guess if they put these on their re-built
>engines you'd never know it unless you took it off to look at it. Anyway I
>guess I'll try the exchange, I'll specify one head without any mistakes.
>Anyway , Am I over reacting to this ? Is the gouge not really a big deal?
>Thanks for letting me rant a little.
