	There are a few questions you need to answer before you decide
which car you'd like to autoX.
	First:  How competitive do you want your car to be?  From all
reports, the 914 is only competitive at the local level (SCCA competi-
tion) any more.  It doesn't seem to stand a chance nationally.  And,
of course, if one or more of those nationally-competitive folks are in
your area, it also won't be taking local honors, either.  The Rx-7
appears to be a *very* competitive car at all levels, particularly in
CSP trim.  It takes a pretty big pile of money to get it there, but it
tends to go faster with that same pile of money than the 914 does.  (I
know this sounds a lot like what Josh2 said, but most of my SCCA-type
info comes directly from him.)
	Second:  What style of driving do you want to use?  The Rx-7
is very much a point-and-squirt car.  Handling isn't great (c'mon, it
has a live rear axle, f'r cryin out loud!) but power-power-power-power
and you never really *have* to shift.  So you get the car pointed, and
step on the go pedal.  The 914 is a "speed-maintenance" car.  You don't
have to slow down so much for the turns, which is a good thing because
you don't have the brakes to do it that well, nor the power to speed
up once you're going straight.
	I rode with an SCCA Rx-7 driver when he took a run in my car,
and I was totally dumbfounded at the way he drove it.  He slowed WAY
down for the turns, and made sure the front wheels were just about
completely straight before getting on the power.  At least, at the
start of the run--by the end, he was starting to slide the car a bit,
and getting on the power earlier.  He commented that it was a very
different ride!
	Third:  How many events do you want to enter?  Locally (SF Bay
Area), the PCA is at least as active autoXing as the SCCA.  If you put
together all four of the truly (AutoX-) active Regions in Zone 7, there
are something like 20+ events per year.  And we get more runs in than
most SCCA events do, because there are fewer people running.  If you
are driving an Rx-7, you can't participate in those (except under spe-
cial circumstances, which probably won't happen more than a couple of
times per year).  The 914 is competitive at all levels of PCA autoXing,
because it is almost always classed against other 914s.  (Rules vary
Zone to Zone and Region to Region, though.)
	The last question is:  What kind of fun do you want to have
with the car?  If you want the thrills of open-top motoring, in a light,
lively, responsive, and underpowered car, then the 914 is really what
you need.  If you want the thrills of going REALLY FAST at 8500 RPM and
actually having power up there, with fairly-reasonable handling, and
the (remote) possibility of a national Solo II trophy, then the Rx-7 is
for you.
	I know what *my* choice would be, but I'm not exactly objective.
