For what 'names' and recommendations are worth, I've seen Bob Hoover
(writer of info on the Bob Hoover Sermons web site) mention his preference
of RIMCO for type 1 work and Mark Stephens High Perf.   for type 4.

WOW , Been-there
     The factory says you can not reinsert a "seat", my shop tried to
do it and it fell out about 3 weeks later.
     The shop then reinserted it and pinned it in, and it has stayed
in. Now this show was an old time VW type 1-4 shop, so they knew what
they were doing.
     The overall bet path is to ship them to RIMCO in Cal. They will
rebuild the head and put new seats in and then bake it. Last time I sent
a set out it cost $100 each to rebuild.
     BTW: what is happening is the guides are worn and the guide to
stem gap is too wide, so the valve get hot and stretches , then it
starts pounding on the seat irregularly (think of it as a bent valve ),
and that knocks the seat out. I have found that forged pistons can be
cleaned up with a dermer tool and re-used if you did not hole it or
crack the skirt.
