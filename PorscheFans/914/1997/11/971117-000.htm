Hi P-Fans,

I met Chuck Beck at the last Pomona swap meet.  He is an interesting fella.  I sat in his latest Spider and we 
talked for a while.  There was a silent crowd all around listening to all he had to say.  He seemed to be 
respected by everyone around. 
One of the things he talked about was how he converted the 911 six into a four.  Which 2 cylinders would he 
chop off?  He eventually decided the the best choice were the middle two. He said that was the easy part. The 
machining of new crankshaft, camshafts, and distributor was a real pain but worth it.  He still owns this 
engine and says it revs up to 7+k, no problem... plenty of power too!  I'll bet not very many people have been 
down this 4 cylinder overhead cam road before.  Wonder how much $$ he's got tied up in this engine?
I asked him if a type 4 engine was available in the 550.  He said he did not like the type 4 engine.  He calls 
it a "tractor" engine and does not consider it to be a high reving motor.  He prefers a massaged type 1.  
Just wanted to share this story with you all. I really enjoy this forum on Porsches.  I appreciate the 
responses that I have received on my recent posts. I subscribe to other PorscheFans digests but the 914 is my 
favorite. 

Michel
