The rear oil seal can be done with the engine in teh car. The galley
plugs are not easilly replaceable. What you_can_ do is to smear JB weld
(or other metal epoxy) over them to keep them in place and from leaking.
However, if a galley plug is going to leak oil, it will leak oil at a
very very high rate. The general mode of failure for these is total and
catastrophic. So if you havn't dumped 4 quarts of oil in 4 seconds, then
I'd look at the flywheel seal as your main culprit.

THe galley plugs are on the engine case, on both front and rear. They
are aluminum plugs that are pressed into the holes where the oil
passages are formed in the casting process. A general rebuild
thing-to-do is to replace them with threaded plugs. But that is usually
only done durring a complete teardown.
