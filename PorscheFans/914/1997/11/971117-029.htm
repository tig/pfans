Hello Car Guys,

I know I have been writing a lot, but its just because I love my car (1974
914 2 litre 4) so much and I want it to be the best it can be.  

Of course, with all cars that are over 20 years old, I have been having
little problems that just drive you crazy.  My question for today is one that
will hopefully make me a liitle bit more idependent when dealing with my car.
 Now assume that I dont know hardly anything about cars and even less about
the 914.  But that is one of the reasons why I like this car.  You can work
on it yourself and have fun playing and restoring and all that good stuff.
 What is the best way to go about learning more about my car?  I want to
learn all that I can so that when I need to fix my FI system I know what I am
doing.

Any information would be greatly appreciated.  I know there are many people
that know just about everything there is to know about cars.  Simply, how did
you get to that point?

Thanks,
Ross Olney
