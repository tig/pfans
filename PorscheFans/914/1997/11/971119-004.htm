>> Also while I'm wating for my shop manuals to come in, I was wondering how
to remove the seats.  The handle to slide the seats is broken off and I
can't seem to see any bolts to unfasten to remove the seats.  <<

Todd,

You can still slide the seats forwards by pulling up on what's left of the
seat adjuster handle.  If you slide it far enough forward, you hit the stop.
The stop is on the other seat rail, and you can push upwards on this spring
catch and your seat will continue to slide forwards until it comes off the
rail.  Use a flashlight and peek under the seat, it's easy to see how it
works.  To replace the seat, just slide it back in.

To remove and replace the seat rails, first remove the seat, then undo the 4
10mm bolts.  Installation is the reverse of removal.  Put the rails back
first, then slide the seat back on.  It's much easier to install the rails
without having to jiggle the seat at the same time.
