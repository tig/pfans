: The ballast resistor goes between the + terminal on the coil and the 12V
:supply. I think they are typically 1.4 ohms, 20->30 watts. You'll have to
:get buddy-buddy with a parts guy and ask him to let you look at his parts
:book. You want one with it's own little mounting bracket. They cost a few
:dollars, not much. If you get the Pertronix, it'll have directions and
:diagrams with it that will explain everything. Good luck!

    Thanks,

         I already have a Petronix from the PO so I don't have
    any documentation. Maybe I can call Petronix and get them
    to send me some literature.

                

                        Thanks.
               (Did I already say that?)

         I'm in Loveland CO and would like to hook
      up with some other local P' types.
      My e-mail is:
        trammell@juno.com
         or
        trammell@alf.emri.com
