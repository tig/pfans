Hello All, 
I too have seen a 911 motor cut down into a four cylinder, but Chuck
Beck did this. Yes the same Beck that built the 550 spyders. Dont know
how well it ran, but looked cool.

Also on the thread of the 550 Spyders, As far as I know the 550 spyder
rights have been sold off to Thunder Ranch, but Chuck Beck must have
some arangement with Thunder Ranch because he is still making them     
(We dont ask). I dont know what the deal is but, seems like every time I
go over to my buddys shop Randy Beck (Chucks son, same complex) Chucks
got another 550 in the making ???

 Don
