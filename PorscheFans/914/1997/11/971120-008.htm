LIsters-

Early next year (after I recover from Christmas & taxes...) I'll be in 
the market for a 914, pref. '73 or earlier 2.0.  Being mechanically 
challenged, it's worth it to me to pay 'more' for one in great shape 
than a 'project' car.  That said...

It seems 1998 will bring about relaxed smog inspection parameters here 
in CA.  This makes me raise an eyebrow in how one might RELIABLY 
increase performance in one's 914--keeping in mind it ain't no race car, 
an 'almost' daily driver.  So...

Question 1:  When I was young, stupid, and had no money I bought a '76 
914 2.0 that was a lot of fun, when it worked!  It had a dual Weber 
conversion that sounded cool, but rarely worked properly.  I know what 
the good/bad things are about FI vs. carbs.  But are there "better" FI, 
like EFI, systems available for these cars?  I would love to have a 
"modern day" EFI-type gizmo controlling my fuel n' air.  Also, can 
'properly' maintained dual carb setups truly deliver more h.p.? (I'm 
leaning toward FI, but hey, if I get sassy down the road...)  What about 
cam upgrades?  Reliable or not?  Stay away?

Question 2:  On my old 914, it had the factory "sport" suspension, which 
I thought was marvy.  But I wouldn't have minded better braking.  
Assuming I haven't lost more $$$ on Question 1, what have listers used 
as inexpensive-yet-noticeable brake improvements?  Due to cost, I think 
I'll stay away from the 911 upgrade I've read about--or is it no longer 
that expensive?

(look at all this, I don't even have a car yet!!!)

Question 3:  Electronic ignition 'boxes' like Crane/MSD/Jacobs?  
Thoughts?

Question 4:  Summers be gettin' warm--oil coolers or other devices for 
SoCal desert runnin'?  Related: assuming the car I buy has no a/c or 
it's broken, any a/c things to consider--Automotion is pushing a new a/c 
unit in their mag ads...not as important as above of course.

Question 5:  Assuming it has stock alloys, tire recommendations?  I'd 
like a dry performance tire, yet one that will be relatively hi-mileage.  
My old 914 had all season Continentals (!) that maybe added a bit of 
'fun' on curvy roads.

Question 6:  Web source for things to look out for (like my last 914). 
Other than Otto's in Venice, any other SoCal 914 experts/dealers/etc. 
anyone know? Thanks in advance!  Please, reply to me directly so that 
this long mail doesn't get reposted several times!
