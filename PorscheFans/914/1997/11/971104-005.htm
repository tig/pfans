Thanks to all who responded to my 914/Rx7 question.  You know, it's
refreshing to get so many honest responses, rather than "instant bias" that
so many others (not this list) seem to have.  I heard many different
opinions and most were perfectly frank about pluses/minuses of both cars.

The consensus seems to be that the 914 is the better machine, but a lot
tougher (technically and financially) to develop.  The Rx7 is the easiest
to get going and is definitely cheaper, but loses out in fun-factor and
absolute ability.  Most everyone agreed that both were solid choices that
boiled down to personal preference/situation.

To be honest, I'm leaning toward the Rx7 because of initial cost and the
solid support of both the SCCA and Mazda.  I've also still got the 911 for
PCA events, so it's not a complete loss. ;)  Any other opinions?
