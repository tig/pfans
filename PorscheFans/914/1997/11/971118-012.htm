 The only times I lost a CV joint were on the same damn hairpin at the
 track. Once on cool down and the other on the warm-up lap (this is
 worse). >>

A known failure mode of 914 CV's is them bottoming out in the transmission
flange during hard cornering.  Basically the CV cage beats itself to death on
the flange since the half shaft moves inward during cornering.  The cage
cracks, allowing a ball to leave its groove, and poof, no forward motion.
Bruce Anderson told me that an old racing trick is to discard the concave
washer between the CV and the halfshaft, at bothe ends, allowing the
halfshaft to float about 1/8" to 3/16" in the CV splines.  Sway Away used to
sell shafts with even longer splines so that the CV would not ever be forced
by the half shaft to contact either the transmission flange or the stub axle
flange.

I learned this the hard way after the Club Race at Texas this year.  The CV
broke while I was driving the car back from Tech at Parade to the trailer and
upshifted from 1st to 2nd.  There was clear evidence on the flange that the
CV cage had been hitting it quite hard.  I showed the pieces to Bruce, and he
knew immediately what had happened.
