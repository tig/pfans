Why yes they do.  And at a national level you would be running M5.  Any
supercharger(includes turbos, whipples, forced induction of any type)
gets a move into the highest class for a PCR based event that is M5. And
anything goes, kinda like a SCCA Mod class.  You want to run there go for
it.  But a blown 1.8l maybe good for 180-220 HP, better add a couple
extra head studs and a programmable EFI system.  So inorder to be
competitive you need to lighten, lighten, lighten. 

 In this class you can do anything you want except drop a no Porsche
engine in there.  So in theroy you could come up against a 914 with a 917
Turbo-12 Can-AM engine 917-30 engine, and some new technologies.  It
won't happen to offten, but at Boston they did run the Gunner (?) Porsche
K8 spyder, with Derek Bell Driving.  He did some fabulous runs in the
car.  And much faster then FTD for Parade buy several seconds like 10 I
think.

Remeber each PCA can do what they want for local class rules so you may
not be there.

Take Care,
