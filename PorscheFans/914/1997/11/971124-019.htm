	Now that frost and ice covered windshields have become a regular
occurrence around here (parked outside), I figured heat would be a nice
thing to have.  I  never really finished the return-to-normal part
of the head repalcement from about a month ago,  but it's been drivable.
Kinda on an extended test drive.  Once I got those hot air valve thingies
reinstalled I noticed the blower didn't come on when I pulled on the red
handle.

	THIS IS GOING TO SEEM OBVIOUS TO THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN  AROUND
But this is what I've been doing the last couple of days.
	
	I went inside and gotmy voltmeter (the one without the  low  battery
warning:-}  and decided to start at  thered handle since in the past sometimes
the fan would be intermittent either on or off.  I was  able to  measure
12 volts  there and worse (or better) I  could hear the relay click when the
handle was moved.

	I turned  my attention to the fan end. I  unplugged the fan connector
and checkedfor voltage there and it  was. 12 volts.  So I took the fan out
and found it was frozen. Well it was, but not that bad. Just for the heck
of it I jumpered the fan to run right off of the battery.  ANd it did!
And now I could turn  it by hand. 0 I plugged it  back in and expected
it to work. No joy. I tried  to measure the voltageat the fan with the
fan plugged in and found none.  Unplugged it was 12 again.   What gives?
There was   some  high resistance  in the path  letting voltage dribble
through but  no current .
(ALmost  forgot, Imeasured 5.6A  through  the fan while it  was running
off of  the battery.  I didn't consider  this excessive).
At this point I had   to go   in and get  the green book with  the 
wiring diagrams.  Turns  out  that  the fuse on the relay panel  was
highly corroded.  It fell  apart when I  removed  it. I cleaned the
contacts and used the installed spare next to it (Looks like It's for
rear defog or  D-jet  fuel  pump,  neither of which   I have) and every-
thing is better now. (I also have a foglight relay which is the horn relay
now  because I have no foglights or foglight switch).
	WHile I was in there I also hooked  up the thermostat to the flap
so I'm  not running full cold all the time and hooked  up the oil temp.
sender.
	I'm still not done. I have  the replacement main fan to put  in there
(the current one has four blades missing), and the new alternator bracket
which was easy  to get   and  pretty cheap~~$8.00 from  the not-so-local
P  dealer.   OK winter,here I  come.

Now   if  I  can  get two cylinders I didn't mess with share some work
while idling, i'd be somewhere.
