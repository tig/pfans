Ah, yes, this is where the wheat gets separated from the chaffe, so to
speak. Previously, I had posted a tongue-in-cheek response regarding the
toughness of the 914 owner. This is one of those times where the true 914
believer reaches for his/her wallet and *gladly* pays the money because it
could be worse. The parts could just be not available at all, as is the
case with many older collector cars. You get to a point eventually where
you don't care how much the part costs, you just care that the part is
available. Looks like it's time to pay up buddy. :)
