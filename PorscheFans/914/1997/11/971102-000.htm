What it sounds like to me is multiple electrical symptoms that cropped
up all at the same time. What was done? The tranny was pulled. I would
first suspect electrical grounds. The copper braided ground at the tail
of the transaxle would be my first suspect. After that, start checking
other grounds too. I'm a firm believer that when a whole bunch of stuff
starts failing all at once, that there is usually only one real culprit.
Problem is, sometimes that culprit is awfully hard to find. I have had
only one instance where more than one thing failed simultaneously, but I
find it statistacally rare. But statistacally rare things happen to me.
I once rolled a GTI autoxing, what are the odds on that? :)

Let's double-check those ground connections.
