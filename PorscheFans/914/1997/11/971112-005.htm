There's zero resistance between the tranny case and the bolt on the
underside of the body where the ground strap attaches.  All the fuses
seem okay.  I get 12V+ between the positive battery terminal and the
tranny case, and 12V+ between the positive battery terminal and the two
ground connections I found up by the headlights.  The fuses all seem to
be seated okay (checked with multimeter).

There are still five wires plugged into each light housing.  I did find
that there's a problem with the left side hazard light - I'll start
running this down tonight, but I doubt that's the source of the main
problem.

I've traced the bundle of wires going to the rear lights up as far as the
engine compartment.  Is there a convenient place to disconnect these
wires so I can see which section of the wiring has the problem?  Also,
according to the wiring diagram, there are 4 ground connections in the
car.  I've found the two up by the headlights, but I haven't noticed
where the other two are hiding yet.  Anyone know where they are?
