Walker- I remember experiencing some of the same symptoms when after
trying to fix a problem out of absentmindedness- namely, I forgot to
install the pilot bearing on my flywheel- I was slamming my drivetrain
back together and...and...the greatest of stupidities- I tried to
tighten the nut for the transmission ground strap with an AIR RATCHET!
Dumb! Dumb! I stripped the stud out, but needing the car, I went off
with my intermittent connection. I kind of expected the alternator light
to go on but I thought it was kind of strange that the tach went to
absolute zero when I pressed on the brakes. I don't recall any of the
other symptoms you mentioned, which is not to say they weren't there,
but I'd check your grounds-all of them- as a possible solution to your
electrical woes.
