	I've heard from two sources that it's a little more
serious than that.  John Muir, in his "Idiot Book", tells us
"Do not tighten to more than 9 ft-lbs, or you will damage
the camshaft!"  This seems to agree with the info from FAT
(who has been building Type IVs for almost as long as they've
been around) as quoted in Hot VWs.
	The other source was from a machinist, who said that
he's seen a lot of Type IV cases with cracked or broken bos-
ses where that long bolt screws in.  According to him, the
Quickie Lube places had to eat a lot of case repairs for a
while, until they stopped dealing with the sump plate com-
pletely.  (Then again, he's talking about some 18-year-old
with an impact wrench...)

	I certainly hope that the cap-nut is the weak part
in that system.  It would be *very* nice to know that, if
I screw up and put 19 ft-lbs on it instead of 9, all I have
to do is buy a new nut.  But, with at least *some* fairly
knowledgeable people saying that more serious things can hap-
pen, I think I'll keep on being fairly paranoid about it.
	Of course, I'm kinda paranoid, anyway...
