Thanks Jim T. and all others who expressed concern for me driving my 914
with my new minimum weight windshield.  I had dinner with my friend tonight
who used to work for a national automotive windshield repair and replace
joint (and also the guy who installed it). He gave me the scoop on the
glass; the thinnest 3 piece laminate windshield allowed on this side of the
pond, made in Austria by Sigla (sp?).  He also says it was OEM and
distributed over here by Libby-Owens Ford.  I never said it was cheap; it
cost roughly $800 and I've had a ton of compliments on it and the
non-standard trim around it.

By the way, for anyone who has seen a 914 windshield frame without the
glass in it, don't EVER think it will give you one ounce of protection in a
rollover.  (I know, it wasn't designed to)  I was just amazed at how flimsy
it is without the structural support of the glass.

Later,

D
