Hello all,

One of the cars in my 914 collection is a 76 model (2.0l of course aren't
they all) that has 28,??? miles on it.  Sorry I can't remember the exact
number.  Anyway I picked up this piece last winter.  And yes I have
finally gotten to take it apart.

This engine did not turn over when I got it.  So I figured it was locked
from sitting the 15 years it sat in town.  No biggie, I would be tearing
it apart anyway, and rebuilding it.  Early this fall I loaned out some
injection parts to help a friend off this car and I found out why it
would not spin over.  I had a rod end peering thru the top of the case. 
Niece I thought, now I know I need at least half a case, I got a spare
1.8L case that would work with slight checks, and changes.

Well This weekend I got sick of seeing the engine sitting here so I
disassembled it.  What did I find, well it is depressing.  A perfectly
good engine that met an early demise.  Not from some thing the owner did,
of no something even more grave.  You see I got that barrel out and
piston.  It was the #4 if anyone is keeping track, and I found a perfect
rod end, no scores no cracks nada.  Of course the piston and barrel had
seen better days.  I had to fish for the rod end, and bolts, but I got
them out also.  Everything is really nice.  So what was the mode of
failure, some body forgot to torque down the nuts on the road bolts.  Yes
it is true.

Moral: Double check all your work and take the time to do it right.

Second moral: I should thank the guy who did this otherwise I would not
have this car.

Take Care,
