I wonder if anyone out there can give me some ideas as to where to start
in tracking down a niggling problem with my '74 2:0 litre? I am
experiencing a slight hesitation/misfire/hiccup which seems to occur
particularly when the car is warmed up and is settled into a steady 5th
gear cruise.... It sometimes happens when I am moving up through the
box, but can be "driven through" with ease. I haven't had the car long
so am not sure if anything has been messed with. I can see that one of
the larger diameter hoses from the airbox which heads towards part of
the FI near the battery tray, has been trimmed so short that it falls
off.

I would also appreciate it if someone can tell me whether the hoses on
the 914 FI are VW parts, specifically Porsche or general auto factor
type? I would like to replace some of the shabbier ones, and of course
the shortened one. Any good sources in the UK/Europe would be very
helpful.

Thanks.


Phil.
