Brian,
There are two different crackin problems in this area.  1st, cracks 
developing between the flare and the body, and 2nd, paint flex cracks.  
These two problems may look very similar from the outside.

The first problem can be prevented with proper preparation.  The steel 
must be brought down to bare metal and given a rough finish so the 
resins can better adhere to it.  When the glass is fitted, straight 
filler (Bondo) should not be used as the base coat between the flare and 
body.  The first coat (which is best to lap under the flare) must have 
glass strands in it or glass matt should be used.  Regular filler should 
only be used for finish work.

Stress cracks in the paint is the second problem.  Older types of paint 
were more brittle.  With Acrylic Enamels, you ALWAYS had to add flex 
additive when painting plastic or fiberglass parts.  New paints are 
commonly Urethane based (Acrylic Urethane) and are flexible enough to 
not require any type of flex additive.  I am not really familiar with 
laquers.

Steel flares is of course the best way to go, but fiberglass and 
plastics can be our friends too.....
