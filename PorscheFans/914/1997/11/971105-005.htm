Mark, yes both are very feasible swaps.  Also there is someone on the
list that has a rotary 914, hopefully they can give you some pointers. 
The Sub swap has been done in a bus that I know of, but it was not an
easy swap, so I don't think the 914 swap would be any easier.  The
discussion can be found in the VW type II achieved some where, sounded
very involved, more so than dropping a 911 engine in a bus.  Or a 914 for
that matter.

Take Care,
