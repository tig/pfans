There is a classic answer to this hesitation problem, as cited by A.A.,
that of a faulty Throttle Position Switch, which can be tested by simply
disconnecting the switch, which is located on the throttle body.
Unplugging it will slow accelleration a bit, as this acts as an
enrichment device during throttle opening, but is often responsible for
hunting at cruise. In my case, the ultimate problem turned out to be a
poor ground connection for the fuel pump, located on my '75 under the
fuel tank. this would usually manifest itself only after a lengthy warm
up. All vacuum and breather lines also have an effect on engine
performance. You can order a complete kit from Auto Atlantis (ta) but
they haven't gotten great reviews. Check out the Dave Darling hose
diagram at Tim's 914 Fan Web Page, for sizes and routing, and do it
yourself for the ultimate in economy and satisfaction.  Jim Sucharski
