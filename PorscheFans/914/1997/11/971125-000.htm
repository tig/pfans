Greetings, 914-er's!

  Two questions:  

1.   Does anyone have a number for the correct replacement lamps
(light bulbs) that are used in the 914 tach and speedo?

2.   Has anyone ever tried to use a 1.8 distributor in a 2.0 litre
engine?   Looking at the advance curve data in the little spec book
(what there is of it) would lead me to believe that it might result
in slightly more advanced timing all the way from idle to 3500 RPM. I
have never been able to arrive at a satisfactory explanation of what
that would do to engine temperature.   In type I engines, the timing
for cylinder # 3 is retarded to make that cylinder run cooler.   On
the other hand,  in all liquid-cooled engines that I know of,
retarded timing is one of the things to look for in cases of
overheating, and before smog, the most advance that you could run
without causing detonation was the best setting.

  I need a replacement distributor for my spare 2.0 litre engine, and
was contemplating this substitution, since the original engine will
most likely be back in the car the next time it has to be smogged. 
Any comments on what results this swap might have?   I am most
concerned about overheating, dropping valve seats, things like that.

					Thanks,
                                                            Jim T.
