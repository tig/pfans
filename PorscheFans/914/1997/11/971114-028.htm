Hello All, 

Yes Randy is still running the 3.6L 914-6 with the stock 901 without ANY
problems. We were out at Willow this past weekend running her around,
this car always wins !!! ok maybe its the driver ; )
 
When in production Randy had a big hand in putting the 550's together.

BTW: Randys 914-6 3.6L Race car is for sale. Dont remember the asking
price, but you can call him at (909) 985-0063
.
