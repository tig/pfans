   You may have a combination of problems, but first, check that
battery.   Deep-discharging a lead-acid battery or leaving it in a
discharged condition will ruin it, so measure the terminal voltage at
the battery.   If less than 12 volts, get a small charger and pump it
up.

   Now, on to the fuel pump.   You say that you have a '74 chassis.  
That should put the fuel pump in the forward starboard corner of the
engine bay, under the "engine shelf".   This location is prone to
water spray, not to mention battery acid coming through from the top,
and as such is very corrosion prone.   The fuel pump has a connector
that mates to two blades on the pump body.   This connector is a
prime spot for corrosion.   I would suggest un-plugging it from the
pump and dousing it liberally with contact cleaner.  Remove it and
re-install it several times to "scrub" the contact surfaces.   
    If the pump is still reluctant to run, measure the voltages on
the pump itself by sticking the meter probes into the back of the
connector, alongside the wires.  If the voltage is much less than 12
volts, measure from the ground pin to the battery negative post. (Not
the clamp, the post itself.)   If there is more than a volt here,
then the ground connection for the pump has gone bad.   Try the stack
of wires on the bolt that sticks out of the side of the engine bay
underneath the relay board on the left side of the engine
compartment.
   Last, if all else fails, remove the pump from it's mounting and
apply power directly to it's pins (with it's normal connector
disconnected).  If it fails to run now, the pump is bad.

					Good Luck,
                                                            Jim T.
