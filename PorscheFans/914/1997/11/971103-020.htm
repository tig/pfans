Well, I could not stay out of this one.

The 914 is by far the better of the two choices.  And here is what it
takes.  Find a good clean one, (you are already mocking me aren't you) no
really you are already in the south.  You are in the land of 914s, locate
a good clean one that runs.  Start with a 73 1.7 liter, why well you get
a side shifter, and you get a 1.7 lite engine.  I know but Steve! 
Everyone says buy the a 73 2.0 liter.  Okay follow along here.

You get the 1.7 liter with D-jet and even if you have to rebuild it, you
are still ahead of what a good 2.0l would cost you.  Now here is the
logic, get the 1.7 liter, scrounge around and you will find 1.7l engines
all over the place, buy a second.  Rebuild both, now you have one in the
car and one spare (IF you do an impression of old faithful).  You will
have maybe a little more than a 2.0l engine rebuild will cost you.  Now
Take it to any auto-x you can find and drive like you have never driven.

Okay want to see how the logic plays out.

Stephen Jacobs plan for the low buck racer.

1) Buy the best chassis you can find, dent and dings don't really matter,
avoid rust.  If it is limited to the battery tray no big deal, BUT make
sure it does not go beyond that point.

2) Buy a parts car of the like year and model, yes it can be rusty, but
if it is running a real plus.

3) Buy or get all the rules pertaining to every class you wish to run.

4) Sit down and Study each one, make a spread sheet of all the mods you
would like to do and see what classes you end up in.  If you don't like
the group you run in change the mods until you fit.  Yes it is possible
you will be in stock PCA class and run in DP under SCCA rules.  This is
the most important step if you want to run multiple sanctioning bodies
and run them all well.

5) Strip off everything of value off your car and parts car and sell it. 
I know most of you are going WHAT! this guy is nuts, but if the budget is
tight, this is one way to get the car done and get the stuff you want. 
Also hold out some of the gem parts for trading, YES it can be done, you
can trade parts and build a car.  I got bushings from out west.  I got a
19mm master for CA, I got suspension goodies from Colorado.  I got BFG
R1s from Alabama, thanks Jon, once again.  You see if you have something
they want and they have something you want, make the deal.  Best part is
the S.O. does not have to see it happen, unless you are as lucky as I am
and have an S.O. that understands.

NOTE:  you will want to keep certain items as extras - windshield,
suspensions, brake calipers, wheels.  If steel you can send out and have
them widened and get those wide wheels for little money.  And body panels
if you got the room.  Other things if they are really clean will make you
 money like hard to find interior pieces, seats and the like.

6) Prep the car in this order.  
	a) Make it complete, function and safe.
	b) Get seat time and lots of it.
	c) Buy or  trade for tires good stickes
	d) at the same time do what you can with the stuff you have IE
alignments
	e) Do driver improvements seat belts (harness, steering wheel,
different seats)
	f) Next do suspension improvements
	g) Maybe brakes - usually by this time you need new pads
	h) Once you have honed your skills move up to a 2.0l and start
the process over!

By now most of you will think I am nuts.  But that is what it takes to
make a good auto-x car.  After which time you could run this in PCA
racing and get on the track, you need seat time for this, they are much
more stringent than most sanctioning bodies.

If done correctly you can have a PCA H class racer, and run a stock
auto-x class P3.  And run it in SCCA with some success.  If your main
concern is SCCA success, well then that pretty much blows the 914 out of
the PCA racing classes.

If you want to know more I can tell you a little more about what it takes
to do this.  I made it so I have broke even so far on my 914 auto-x
project.  But I have had allot of help from many people who I would do
about anything (legal) to repay. And it has taken time, I started this
project a few months after my daughter was born, she is now 4 and will be
5 by the time I hit the auto-x course for the first time in a long time.

But it can be done!  I know people who do it successfully.  

Also don't forget that you will end up needing a tow vehicle or a little
trailer to take the extra stuff with you.  Water, spare wheels with the
stickies on them, jacks and stands, wrenches.  And what ever else you may
need like clothes.

Any body in Colorado, Wyoming, and or Utah, got an extra room?  I saw
some powder (snow)!!!! I got to go skiing now!  Yes it is snowing in
Ohio, but not sticking.  Heck the only time we get real snow around here
is when it falls, the rest of the time it is something else, but it don't
look, feel, or smell like snow.

Take care,

You find a rock to sleep on isn't so bad but it only seems to work when
you are lying on a mountain side.  You wake up refreshed and feeling
good.  But if you do the same thing at home, you wake wondering why you
where so stupid to do that last night.
