I always wondered why the 914 has such a bad reputation when it comes to 
brakes. Other than the pedal being a bit "mushy" (with a 17mm MC), I 
always found my brakes to be very good. Definitely better than a stock 
first gen RX-7. I don't autocross mind you (although I'd like to next 
summer - very non-competitive, I just like driving fast).

Just my opinions...
