I think the reasoning is / was it is part of his business, it is what he
does for a living so you would have to make the best 550 replica you can
since the chance of finding a true one is limited.  He has advantages
over most of use that he is sources parts every day and people will keep
parts for certain individuals, buddy system.

Yes 4 camers can be expensive, but IF you know how and you have the
sources expensive is after all a relative term.  Two me expensive is
anything more than I currently carry in my back pocket. <g>

The one true beauty of a kit car or replica car is you can do things with
it that people would cringe.  There once was a thread about a Jerry S,
who owns several Porsches, has a TV sit-com and has a 550 spyders.  It
seems he change the interior color of the car, because he did not like. 
Boy did that start a war of purist against non-purists.  The replica car
industry is the same way.  I look at it this way it is your car, do with
it what you want.  Hey if you want to build a Baja 550 go for it.  Heck
there are Baja 911 and Ghias out there, why not a 550.  Beck personnely
built some wicked 550s including 911 powered units.  His current love is
the Lister, loves going out the the Kit-car run and guns and blowing the
doors off Cobra replicas.  Of course a few years back his son Randy blow
the doors off all the competition with a 914-6, far from stock, but does
show the potental of the chassis.

I am personnely waiting for the Beck 904 kit to come out.  It is in there
some where, being worked on as interest is peaked.  I have waited 15
years so far what is another 15.  At this point thou I could just build
my own.

Yes I do know AA has a 9014 kit, but it is not to my tastes.  I really
like the original 904 lines and weird little quirks.  The 9014 has lost
some of them, even thou it is probably a more practical car for an every
day / occasional car.  And priced much better than say a Beck 904 would
dream of being.

Take Care,
