Yes, they did use the 901 gearbox, but there's a difference between the 908
motor and a 3.6L 911 six. The difference is torque. The 908 revs to 8
grand, and most likely doesn't have the toque of the big 911 motor.
Gearboxes are really rated on torque, not hp. The fact that the smaller 3.0
L 908 motor probably doesn't have much torque at low revs probably enabled
first speed to survive.

 By the way, the Piech car has an

Yeah, it was a prototype car, built in 1969. The crew customized it for the
boss, and kept quiet about it to the public to prevent the real crazies
from trying to order one. Acording to an article in the latest excellence
mag, the 908 motors had oil consumption problems, and the 300hp version
left clouds of blue smoke when ever it was driven. They put valve stem
seals in the detuned 260 hp version which apparently helped. There's a neat
picture of the motor in the article. The 914/8 had a nice leather interior
and wood trimed dash too. Nice car!
