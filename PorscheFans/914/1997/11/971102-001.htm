Steve,

Fortunately, I didn't have to be very careful when I removed mine.  Half of
it was missing, and the half still on the car wasn't worth much.  The trim
is held on by clips that sometimes break depending on the age and
condition.  The easiest way I've seen is to stick a small screwdriver up
under the trim piece where the clip is located and push or bend the clip
inward.  One edge of the trim should be able to pop free at that point
allowing you to slide the other edge off.

Recently I put a specially made piece of glass in mine.  My buddy works in
a auto glass shop and had this thing shipped in from Belgium.  The glass is
3/16" thick and weighs a wopping 11 lbs.  I think the stock glass is around
18-20 lbs?  Anyway, we installed the new glass using a rubber strip very
similar to the molding around some VW Jetta's.  I think it was 16mm wide,
and had a nice small groove down the center of the rubber.  We had to cut a
slot on the inside edge of the rubber to fit around the sharp corners at
the bottom of the windshield.  It fit perfectly and I've had nothing but
positive comments since and no leaks.  Of course, the windshield was
mounted on a good thick coat of urathane.

Good luck,

Dion
