The first Wankle motors were built to my understanding in the mid sixtys and
first went into Mazda production in 68 or 69.  As to the designation as far
as I know.  There was a 10A, 12A, and 13B.  The 10A and the 12A were the same
in basic block design, stationary geers, and a few other internal parts and
displaced 1.0 liters (the 10A) and 1.2liters (12A).  The 13B was to be there
large car and truck engine (availible in few in America and in large in
Japan) The 13B was first aviailble to my knolage in America in 77 with the
Mazda Cosmo and there small trucks, but did not get recognized till 85 when
they put the little power monger in to there RX7s.  All 85 to current Rx7s
still used the 13B design, but now with the help of more ports, larger ports
and that lovely thing calle TURBOS. : ).     "If i am incorect with anything
here, please correct me."

P.S.  Sorry goes out to  Bill Bechtold about the Seats.  But on the other
side, we "and we know who we are"  didnt want to make a stink publicly, (at
least i didnt) and figured that it was just somebody despret to sell a set of
86 911 seats.  The P-fans list is free, but I my self dont like to come
accross the same messege 3,4,5 and 6 times.  Sorry again Bill.

Thanx  Charles Broadfoot
