David, have you been following the thread about the 550 RSK kit cars?

Since you're there and somewhat connected to Houston happenings, do you
know the whereabouts of Joe Linbeck and Jim Simpson?  They used to be
integrally connected with Mr. Beck, and were one of the exclusive
importers/assemblers of Mr. Beck's very good and famous 550 kit and his
356 Cabriolet kit also.  I have their old card in front of me.  Company &
address used to be:  Contemporary Classics International, 416 Woodline
Dr.,  Woodlands, TX 77386.

I used to visit them up north of town quite frequently.  They were avid
tinkerers and restorers.  They used to peddle the Ferrari GTO conversion
that went on a Datsun 240Z also.  Great craftsman.  Typical artsy type
too, which made them seem wierd to the engineer-types, but that's OK. 
They were great guys, and were a great source for building that kit
stuff.  They always had plenty of odd stuff around, and some standard
stuff too, like Pumas etc.

I tried calling their old number yesterday, in the interest of finding
these guys who are threading about the 550 kits another lead.  If you dig
something up, let me know, I'd like to talk to both of them again.
