	What is it about Rohnert Park CA and my cars?  Hmm?  Can
anyone tell me?
	Guess what happened yesterday afternoon?  Yes indeed!!  I
was sitting in my yellow car in a parking lot, when WHAM!  I got
rear-ended by a BIG ol' Ford van that was backing up.  All I could
think at that moment was, "Oh, no!!!  Not *AGAIN*!"  And of course,
the driver didn't see me.  "Your car, it's lower than my back
windows!"  Hello!!!  That's why your van has OUTSIDE mirrors, too!
	Happily, this was the Honda, and NOT the 914.  I think the
van would have wadded up my rear trunk into toilet paper if I had
been in the blue car.  I suddenly became VERY thankful that one of
the presents that I had been carrying was too large to fit into
the 914.
	The damage to the Honda appears to only be about $700.
That's another good thing about it.  But still, it's going to be
some real aggravation getting it fixed up properly.

	I am kinda mad at myself about this accident, too.  I was
nice and paranoid when I pulled *into* the parking lot, and then
got dumb and complacent when I stopped moving.  If I were a motor-
cycle rider who had survived several years worth of riding, I would
have stayed paranoid enough to keep my eye on all the other cars
(only about 10) in the lot.
	I think it's time to stop visiting those friends of mine
who live in Rodent Park...
