>Talk to me about how you do this ball batting.

I learned a couple tricks while doing the "ball-bat" thing myself.

(1) I first went to the sporting goods store to buy a bat - $35.00.  NO WAY!

(2) I went to the hardware store and bought a series of PVC pipes of varying
diameter - a few cents a piece.  (much better)

(3) Start at either end of the wheel arch with a pipe size that just *almost
fits* toward the top of the arch (between the tire and the fender).
Slowly start the car rolling, pulling the pipe across the fender.  Keep the
pipe straight for an even pull.

(4) When you get to the top of the arch *STOP*.  If you go past this point,
it will pull the lip out, instead of rolling it under.

(5) Start the pipe from the other end of the wheel arch, and again roll
until you've reached the mid-point where you stopped in the other direction.

(6) Repeat the process with incrementally larger pipes until you've reached
the desired effect.

BTW - We were able to do this without cracking any paint.

Hope this helps!
