I went to 
>Otto's in Venice to see howw much it cost to install them.  I had pulled
the arms off and all they had to do was take the old ones off and put the
new ones on ...correctly.  They pryed the old ones off and proceeded to put
the polys on , hammering the crap out of them.  I vaguely remember getting
an e-mail about how you're supposed to "fit" them to each end before
installing them.  Are these bushings totally wasted or can I salvage them by
removing them and trimming them to size?

Man, some mechanics are just plain stupid, if you ask me. Yes, the
instructions specifically say to file/sand/whatever the control arm before
installing the new bushings so that they fit correctly without binding. I'm
glad I do my own work and not have to subject my car to these neanderthal
techniques. if you can get them off without cracking them, then I would
certainly re-do it correctly.
