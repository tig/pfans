HI Phorteeners,

I'm intrigued that the 914 seems to have unlimited (and highly creative)
failure modes.  I'll try a wild guess. How rusty is the rotor? 6 months
is a long time to sit and there's not much clearance between the pads.
If it is, you could back off the venting clearance without removing the
wheel(no ideaa if it would help, though:-). Also did you check that both
E-brake *cables* are free? Take a look at the little e-brake levers on
the back of the calipers. It will be obvious if one is hung up.
