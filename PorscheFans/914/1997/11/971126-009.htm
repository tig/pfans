I am interested in a Porsche PCA Club Racing and Track day 
participation, as well as SCCA autox, etc.  My budget will restrict me 
to an older, less expensive car, which I would intend to restore to 
clean condition, and use almost exclusively for friendly competition. 

I could probably spend $7,500, plus my own labor & skills on the project 
over the next year or two.

Would list members care to comment whether a 73 or 74 2.0 914 would be a 
suitable car for these purposes?  Given that I'm not too familiar with 
914's, and there don't seem to be many available in my area (Utah), I'm 
wondering if this 23 or 24 year old car would make a good selection for 
this purpose?  Are adequate parts available, and would the car be 
welcomed as a fun-racer in PCA events?  Would another Porsche be better 
at similar costs?

Thanks in advance.

Robert
