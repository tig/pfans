Well that all depends on what you want to do with the car. My general
response to that is "Do you ever intend to compete with car? If so,
decide on what class you want to compete it, and then READ THE RULES.
Then and only then, start your mods.". However, if you have no
intentions of competing, go for what ever you feel like. Just remeber
the race car builders decree...

"Speed is just a matter of money. How fast can I afford to go?..."

Keep in mind that _any_ engine transplant will wind up costing ALOT of
money. And it is never a simple bolt-in swap. Even if you were to just
go from a 1.7 to a 2.0, there will still be funny problmes that will
arise.
 
My preference for a 914 would be for a big six. As much as I love
rotaries, I don't think that it would suit my somewhat purist
tendancies. As for rotary powered beasties, a friend of mine and I came
up with the ultimate E-mod screamer. A supercharged, ported, 13B rotary
powered X1/9. Oh my god! Did he mention that dastardly immitator? Yup,
it's shorter and narrower, already built to accomdate a water cooled
engine (radiator), and potentially can be lightened more than a 914 can.
But that's neither here nor there.

I pick up most of my new suspension stuff tomorow. Gonna be a handfull
of work. :) :) But when it's done I hope to have a car that no longer
needs brakes. :)

Turn? What turn?! You call that a turn?! Gimme something tougher!  :)
zooom!
