Connected, it will gradually close. Disconected, it will remain open and
tend to increase your idle speed.

The 'beetle' sound? Are you refering to the chain-rattling sound? That's
teh sound from the mechanical fuel pump of the beetle, and not possible
with a fuel injected 914. So, if it really is that chain rattling sound,
I'd have concerns of something loose that's rattling around. Possibly
something that could cause power loss. Any more I can't say right now.
It's too early and I havn't had my coffee. But the drive to work was...
fun, yeah that's it, fun! Almost a foot of snow at my house over night
and it was a blistering *7* degrees this morning. Damn, I love driving a
quattro with studded tires.
