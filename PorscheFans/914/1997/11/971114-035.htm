I know I've seen him change trannys a couple of times at POC events.
Maybe he's switching between the long and short boxes at the track, but
that strikes me as somewhat unlikely, since he certainly knows by now
which tranny suits each particular track.  The only thing I "know" (not
really know, since it's a matter of opinion), and I fully admit that I'm
going on just what I think I've seen in the pits at POC time trials over
the past two years and I haven't asked him how often he goes through
trannys, is that I've seen enough that I wouldn't label running a 901
with a 3.6L race motor as "without any problems".
