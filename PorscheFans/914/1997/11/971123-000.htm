Hi everyone,

I had a dropped exhaust seat two years ago. I had driven to a Porsche
Club autocross  and was sitting idling while talking to a friend. Since
the conversation was continuing a little longer than I thought it should
I shut off the motor. When I finished the conversation I tried to start
the car but the engine wouldn't turn over. I thought the battery was gone
so we tried to push start it but then the wheels wouldn't turn. We pushed
it backward in gear. Then it turned over. I started it to only hear
expensive noises and quickly shut it off. I replaced both heads, cleaned
up the piston and it has worked fine.

I had driven the car through the mountains the day before. It had gotten
hot on one long grade to the point of "pinging" one time on the trip. We
had shut it off and started it many times on that trip with no problems.

==============

I need some help on a couple electical gremlins. My dash lights don't
work, any ideas? In what order should I check things?

My brake warning light on the dash flashes all the time. The emergency
brake is disengaged.

When I shut off my headlights the passenger side light doesn't retract.
But when I start the car up the next day, it retracts. Go figure!

Thanks in advance for your help.
