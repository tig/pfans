Ever lose something that you could have sworn was in your front trunk?

The other day, I got back from the local parts store with the standard
ignition tune-up stuff and opened my front trunk to get it out.  2 boxes
were missing!  I cussed and swore and was about to go back to the store
and accuse them of not putting everything in the bag when I noticed a
'hole' (no, not a rust hole, just an opening into ??) near one of the
headlight buckets.

I carefully put my hand down there and pulled out:
5 globs of dust! 4 pieces of paper, 3 craftsman wrenches, my 2 missing
boxes, and a partridge-in-a-pear-tree.

Well, OK, there wasn't a partridge in a pear tree down there, but you
get the picture.  So if you haven't checked lately, stick your hand down
there (there's one of these recesses on each side) and see what you come
up with.
