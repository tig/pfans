Quick Update:  I've managed to get the wiring harness and ECU out of the
car and into my apartment, and have chopped all of the remaining brittle
and cracked "wire tubes" off of the harness.  I needed a way to bundle
all of the wires together after I'm done, so I went to Radio Shack and
bought some flexible plastic tubing with a split in the middle, and some
of that spiral coil plastic stuff.  The split tubing is about 1/2in
diameter, so I'm going to use that on the main segment of wires as the
leave the brain.  The spiral stuff is a little less than 1/4 in, so I'll
use that everywhere else.  I'm sure this stuff will work good for
keeping the harness organized, and the package indicates that it's
suitable for automotive applications, so I don't think it'll melt while
sitting on the hot engine, but it's by no means water resistant.  Due to
the poor condition of my harness before I began, I know it wasn't
either...  So, here's where the questions begin:

1. Just how important is it that the harness remains water resistant?
2. If I want to clean all of the oil and grime off of the surface of the
wires, can I use something as harsh as BrakeCleen, or do I need to use
something as mild as a dry paper towel?
3. My experience with things of an electrical nature is limited...
what's the best way to solder a broken wire back together again?  Should
I twist the wires together and then solder, or just lay them next to
each other and solder?

Thanks again!
