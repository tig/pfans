Someone on the list was trying to get some people together to get some new
harnesses made, but I think he gave up due to lack of interest. At any rate
JJ, I assume you have some good technical manuals on your car, like Haynes,
et al.?? If so, I would remove the harness, applying a label to each
connector to tell where it goes, then take the harness and give it a
thorough once over. Clean and test every stinking wire in the thing. Use the
manual to make sure each wire goes where it's supposed to go. Each wire has
a number on it, which corresponds to the wiring diagram. Actually, some
wires don't have numbers because they are the ground wires, as I recall.
What I would do is take a continuity tester (or ohm meter), and test to see
if wire number XX at the ECU box end of the harness actually connects to
wire XX at the other end of the harness. Each wire is labeled at 2 places,
at the ECU box end and at the end that connects to the component. If Haynes
et al, don't show these details (can't remember right now, but I don't think
they do), I can send the information to you. It's time consuming, but what
else do you have to do with what? 6 feet? of snow outside??? :)
