I had some made that way, worked fine.  As to backspace, 4-7/8" works with most
stock fenders (some rears need baseball bat help).  You could go to 5" or
5-1/4" and still not have any inside rubbing, but you also narrow the track
that way.  I only used 205/50s on mine, so don't know about 225s.

What's the company that does them in your area?
