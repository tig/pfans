They grease light sockets, too, especially exterior lamps before inserting
the bulbs for added weather protection of the contacts. They added mineral
fillers (crushed rock to the layman) to the grease, not to improve
conductivity, but to make it cheaper. Dirt cheap so to speak. In
environmental testing, salt spray booths, hot/cold thermal cycling, etc.,
the difference in failure rates greased vs. ungreased  was orders of
magnitude. A little cheap insurance there.

A little silicone grease in the spark plug boot improved breakdown voltages
tremendously, too.
