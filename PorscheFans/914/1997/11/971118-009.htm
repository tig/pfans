Hi all...

I have a '70 914 dedicated track car.  I've been setting it up, and   
working bugs out all summer, and finally got it to the track in Nov.   
 Whew!  I've been wondering about modifications for next year.  The car   
is a 1.7 with a NPR big bore kit @ 94mil.  I was told that would make it   
a 1.9.  When I bought the car it had been fitted with a carburator   
conversion kit.  The kit was actually manufactored for replacing the   
solex carbs on a VW bus, but seems to fit nicely on a 914.

I love the way the car handles.  It's fantastic.  But I must say I'm not   
too happy with the "getup and go".  My BMW (1.8 with FI) and my brothers   
car (914 2.0 with FI) both seem to have considerably more power.  My   
engine is *very* fresh, so I am assuming it's the crappy carb setup.

I know that most 914/4 people probably prefer the FI as opposed to some   
"hack" conversion.  I would personally have FI, but I don't think I could   
go through installing that.  Also, FI has changed a great deal since   
then.

I was wondering if anyone has glanced through some of the VW mags, and   
all the suppliers that sell stuff, some for the 914.  One supplier, whose   
catalog I got, has bolt on competition fuel injection in various   
configurations, complete with dash controls, for about $1500.  I know   
that seems like a lot, but it seems that this would be a major   
advancement for this engine.  That and an electronic ingintion...

Does anyone have any expiriences with this type of after market FI?

Thanks for any info.

Matt
