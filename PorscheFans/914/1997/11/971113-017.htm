Jebby and All,
    Joe Pauza was a man's man and nobody had a better friend.  While Joe was
living in Houston he was a regular customer and friend of ProTechnik in
Stafford.  I have a picture on my desk of Joe, Bill Mueller, Sam Shalala and
I standing in front of Sam's racer at the 24-hour of Daytona.  We really
miss him.

    Sam is the point of contact for Joe's car.  He can be reached at
281-879-8861 during business hours central time.

    Everything about the car is as Jebby has stated.  I have seen the dyno
sheet from FAT...and the invoice.  It's a very nice racer and Joe maintained
it well.  It's worth the money being asked.

Regards,
DC
'75 914 2.0L
