	I don't know, but I've seen some A Mod cars with Type-IVs and
a
blower.  I thought it wouldnt be a bad Idea or an impossible  fit with
one.  The biggest problem  I saw  was that he didn't have   any cooling
tins  on   there at all.  Or  a  fan. You could  say it  was water cooled.
(from  a garden sprayer between  rounds).  Also no alternator.

	WIth a fan it would have to run off of an extension like the 
smog pump.  I don't know if there would be room for it or what the
leverage would  do  to the fan bearing.
