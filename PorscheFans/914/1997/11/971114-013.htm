Hay 914ers!

My spring/summer stockpile of struts and conversion bits and pieces have all
gone to deserving projects in the US, AU and CA.  Thanks to all of those who
have purchased the kits!
This is the last of my stock and I'ld love to find a new home for it ASAP.
 Feel free to ask questions about the conversion.  I'ld be happy to try and
answer them.
