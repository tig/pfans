Hi Guys.

Some know this, some don't, that I lived in Houston for 3 years and moved
to Dallas in '94.

The Houston region of PCA was stunned by the back to back deaths of two
of its members earlier this year, Joe Pauza and Jay Pineau.  Porsche
folks from all over the world remember Jay as the guy who rebuilt Porsche
water pumps.  Locally, we remember him as the guy who had an awesome 550
Spyder replica autocrosser.  Jay died in a parachuting accident in
Mexico, and Joe died of a heart attack, while trying to relocate to the
Florida area.

Because of my friendship with Joe, I had inquired earlier this year to
see whether Joe was selling the 914 to lighten up his ownings, for his
move to FL, only to be shocked and find out that he'd passed away :-(    
 Well, Joe's widow  is now trying to sell Joe's 914.  The details are
sketchy at the moment, but I'll have more if you are truly interested. 
I'll enter what I do know, and you can post me if you or someone you know
are really interested.
