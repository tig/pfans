So, if the oil strainer bolt at 9ft-lbs can be treated the same,
this is like 29ft-lbs at operating temp and I suppose case
deformation could take place above cold 15ft-lbs in this area...

Jeez, them quikie lube guys must've been torquing to 25+
yeah, that would raise hell with any typ IV at operating temp."

Further thoughts from Jebby:
Since I work for THE trade association that represents the fast lube
industry worldwide, I thought it a good idea to add on to this thread
that's been running for a while about this specific oil drain bolt, and
its torque requirements.

There's no way our association can police every member's facility, but
there are some general good-practice principles that the good
practitioners adhere to consistently.  Since the good ones survive over
the long haul on selling you a "trustable" product / service, the basics
ARE simple and consistent, worldwide.

First, as a rule of thumb, 90% of our customers drive cars that are 8
years old and newer.  So, our technical manuals / books for common
everyday service go back to encompass 10 to 12 years and once in a while
15.  As technicians, that tells us that when a vehicle comes in for
service, that is out of the regular purview of the ordinary manuals, that
vehicle (and customer driving it), need special attention to detail.

Second, on these "special" vehicles & their drivers, you need a
combination of 1- extra authoritative manuals, 2 - the customer's say-so,
and 3 - the special manuals that come with the vehicle.

Now, some customers are so arrogant as to believe the technician is God
and owns all Bibles pertaining to ALL vehicles, but they are more rare as
customers.  Most, who drive these special vehicles, also take the time to
carry the manuals in their special vehicles when going to get repairs /
service, or they are indeed cognizant of pertinent info (like torque
settings, quantities and measurements for service about-to-be rendered).

So, intelligent technicians don't mind at all when the owner of a waiting
vehicle (specialty or not) offers info that is peculiar and supportive in
performing the service task at hand.  Those who believe the customer to
be a nuisance don't stay in biz too long, because they (the arrogant
technicians) are really the nuisance to the customer, the customer's
figure that out, vote with their feet / $$$, don't go back, in turn
closing the nuisance service facility doors.  Save your valued 914 -
speak up to the tech when buying your service.

Now let's take a look at the accepted manuals / literature.  My
association publishes THE _Engine Oil Drain Plug Torque Chart 1980 -
1997_, covering vehicles from A(cura) to V(olvo),  in conjunction with
the Chek-Chart company, who publishes the most notorious and accepted
manuals for the industry.

Notice the dates.  Your 914 doesn't fall within that category.  That
means that Johnny Lube Tech has to resort to a tech manual that goes back
30 years (from Chek-Chart).  Guess what?  It doesn't list torque settings
on drain plugs for anybody, because the industry wasn't interested in
those figures that long ago.  So he must look at your service manual that
comes with the car, or ask you personally, at which point he finds out
about the 9 lb/ft  recommendation.  (BTW it's lb/ft   -   NOT ft/lb)

FYI when you're down in the low (10 and below) lb/ft recommendations, you
should seriously consider utilizing a torque wrench that is lb/in, for
much better accuracy of calibration in that range.  Torque wrenches are
most accurate in their middle-area ranges of measurement, and not at the
extreme highs or lows.  Mathematically converting to lb/in's is a mental
no-brainer and worth the trouble for those light jobs we are talking
about with this particular drain bolt.

How about a worst case scenario where you don't talk / have a
relationship with your service technician, and the technician is the
worst kind of assumptive person?  Well, when he comes to the "old"
manuals and doesn't find your ride listed, he looks back at the newer
manual, and sees this:
>>>FROM CHART<<<
PORSCHE
1990-96  6-cyl 3.6L..........37*
                  Others..............36
1991-93  6-cyl 3.3L Turbo ..37*
1983-92  911.....................51**
                  Others..............36
1980-82  911.....................51**
                 924.....................29
                 Others................36
* Oil tank drain plug same torque
** Oil tank drain plug torque is 30 lb/ft
>>>END OF CHART<<<

Now guess what happens!  He assumes that your Porsche 914 probably fits
in the "other" category and you get something like 36 lb/ft (and as long
as he's assuming, he applies 36 or 30 lb/ft to your oil tank if you're
driving a 914/6).

I won't be Polyanna and tell you that "there are NO worst-case
technicians out there".  I will say that they aren't the norm.

It is incumbent upon YOU to nicely hover over your "special" vehicle, AND
be a communicator.  There IS a way to nicely make sure your technician
has the applicable specs for your car, and still maintain a friendly
relationship.  Considering the cost of repair of damage after the fact,
in this instance, I'd say it's a good idea to be a good communicator with
your technician.  That's why many folks take their cars to specialists,
but they also pay higher prices for the service.  Price for service is a
moot point to me, I make sure my technicians know MY car when they are
gonna work on it.
