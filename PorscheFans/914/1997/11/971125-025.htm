    No... If you have the original transmission, it's a TAIL
    shifter; the superior side-shifter wasn't introduced until 1973.

    There are a couple of good reasons for this arrangement:

        1.  First gear is generally used (and with a 901
            transmission, should ONLY be used) for starting from a
            dead stop.  Since first gear never gets used while
            driving, it makes sense to keep 2nd through 5th in a
            two-column "H" pattern; the alternative, which you call a
            "normal" pattern, spreads 2nd through 5th across THREE
            columns, making it hard to shift quickly among them.

        2.  If you've ever been stuck in the mud or snow or
            whatever, you may have noticed that the "normal" 5-speed
            pattern makes it VERY hard to rock the car back and forth
            by alternating between Reverse and 1st.  The 914's pattern
            makes it trivially easy.

    For what it's worth, the 914's pattern was in nearly universal use
    by ALL 5-speed transmissions when the 914 was developed; the
    pattern that you call "normal" only came into widespread use when
    mainstream auto manufacturers found that their old 4-speed
    transmissions (which worked just fine when mated to big, torquey
    V-8s) didn't work real well with the new, higher-revving
    small-engined cars that they started building in the 70s and 80s.
    Since their customers were already familiar with the standard
    4-speed "H" layout, those manufacturers hung 5th gear off the side
    of the "H" and left the positions of 1st through 4th alone.
