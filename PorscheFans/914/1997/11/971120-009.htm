Your're right. . .its not that simple.

Anyway, I'm doing a rebuild, and in this handy book
'How to rebuild VW's' Tom Monroe (?) says
to torque the case bolts no more than 25ft-lbs because
as things heat up, the expansion adds an equivalent
20ft-lbs+ to the existing bolt torque. . .45ft-lbs is a lot
of torque for aluminum being tweeked metal to metal
or across a cavity.  The type IV (914 et al) case is
ordinary aluminum -not an alloy like Fuchs wheels that
get a 60+Ft-lbs.

So, if the oil strainer bolt at 9ft-lbs can be treated the same,
this is like 29ft-lbs at operating temp and I suppose case
deformation could take place above cold 15ft-lbs in this area
because there is no direct support in the cavern between the
oil sump and the lower supports where the cam rides in the
bearing bores.

Jeez, them quikie lube guys must've been torquing to 25+
yeah, that would raise hell with any typ IV at operating temp.

Sorry to have overlooked that everyone. .but then I have *two*
torque wrenches, and I sleep with them under my pillow.  ;)
I eliminated my paranoia after cracking an aluminum chevy head
almost in half for lack of a torque wrench.  Sequence is also very
important. . .

Incidently, proper care of a torque wrench includes keeping them
warm and well-fed prior to use.  An annual calibration is cool, too.
