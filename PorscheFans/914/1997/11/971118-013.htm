I've been worrie dabout this eventuality when I go to wider sticier race
tires. Thinking of 245 Hoosiers. I know that alot of probelms can be
aleviated by reinforcing the trailing arms, but sadly that's not allowed
in my rules. However, what _is_ allowed in my rules are _any_ traction
aiding devices whose sole intent is to limit lateral motion of the
suspension. So I talked to few tweakers that I knew and came up with an
idea of a double watts linkage at the rear. It would be legal within the
scope of the rules, and would probably be alot better than just boxing
the trailing arms. Heavier, true, but probably keeps the lateral motion
to _zero_. Funny how these rules can be so restrictive one way, and so
open another.

It's not a matter of what you can't do.It's a matter of what you _can_
do.

Would that prevent said CVs from detonating?
