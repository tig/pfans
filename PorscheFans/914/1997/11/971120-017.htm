You're right on the money about AMP having the terminal for this. I used to
work for one of their main competitors in the auto terminal business (one
of GM's divisions). At the time (late 70's - early 80's) AMP was considered
to be the main supplier of terminals to the European automakers. I would be
very surprised if the edgecard terminal, along with the others in the car,
is not an AMP product.
