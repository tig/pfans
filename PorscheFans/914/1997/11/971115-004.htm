Hey Walker, 
Well your right, "Without Any Problem" is probably the wrong words to
use, But he really dosnt break that often. I spoke with him today and he
did have two broken tranny's this season.
1) Las Vegas (just gave up)
2) Willow Springs (missed a shift and the tranny couldnt handle it)

Yes he dose break form time to time, but look what kinda abuse he puts
through that old 901 tranny.
I know without a doubt that his street car with a 3.2L has lived in
there for many years without any problems and I think he is harder on it
than the race car, but with out the high speeds for long periods of
time.

All Im saying is the 901 can handle more than alot of people give it
credit for.

Later, 
 Don
