Yeah.  I'm glad I didn't have to make that distinction.  Thanks for doin'
it Andy.  I always hated that part about the math classes where the
instructors were such know-it-alls.  The only people I know who were
interested in making an issue out of it were my anal retentive math
teachers in engineering school and graduate school.  They were so
dogmatic about it and that's why I even remember it, mostly because they
acted like we were being trained for some military assignment (and I'd
already been through the military by that time in my life).

I even had one mechanical engineering professor who made a deal out of it
in this way, by saying, "Just because EVERYONE says, 'Nook-you-lehr', it
doesn't make it right.  It's spelled N-U-C-L-E-A-R, and it's pronounced
'Nook lee ahr'.  Likewise, everyone else may say 'foot pounds'  but IT IS
POUND-FEET.  Why?  Because torque is a force (pounds) applied at a radius
(feet), and not the other way around. Repeat after me - pound-feet..." 
Almost 20 years later, I can still hear his words ringing in my ears. 
Such is the plight of the thoroughly drilled engineering student.

Ya know?  Just for grins, I went out to the garage last night and found
all of my torque wrenches, tables / charts on my wall, and tables /
charts in repairs manuals and they ALL read Pound-Feet, Pound-Inches, or
Newton-Meters. not one deviation in the bunch.

So, I'm glad you set us all straight (especially us anal retentive
engineering types).  I will now tell anyone who asks, "It doesn't matter,
because my friend Andy Warren says so, he owns a 914, and I trust HIM 
:-)"

Thanks Bud.  You're right.  It IS a moot point.  But, it's been fun
bantering about anyway.

On to more fun stuff - how's the Red Machine these days?
