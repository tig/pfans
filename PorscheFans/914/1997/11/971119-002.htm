Hey Dudes,

I have so much work to do I can barely keep up with the flow here, but
the ECU connections in the engine harness are card-edge types and
are crimped onto each wire.  I am sure AMP would have a rough equivalent
for the ECU terminals, but they wont be exact and probably a pain in the 
rear
to retrofit.

No, I dont work for AMP, nor would I profit from them in any way, but I have 
used
and specified a shipload of their stuff for use in my employer's products.
(SCSI based RAID storage arrays)  aka DASD's

AMP makes electronic connector terminals *big* time. . .they probably have
a web-site, and are based in Harrisburgh Pennsylvania.  A trick I like to 
use
is schmoozle a local rep and ask for samples, say 5 terminals.  These will
be delivered within a week (usually a couple days) and is almost faster than
ordering from a parts house over the phone.  Oh, and they be FREE!
I suppose this could be abused and then you would be SOL, so be forwarned.

If memory serves, the ECU harness has wire terminations that are crimped,
not soldered into each terminal, and they are secured in the connector 
housing
with small tangs formed by the terminal that engage in the housing.  I have 
had
these apart, and unless there has been damage of some sort, are *very* well 
made.
If anything, vibration and age would cause the terminal to circuit card edge 
connection
to degrade.  The circuit board (the system Brain) uses gold-plating in these 
connection
points, but it is possible for a buildup of grunge at the contact point.  In 
this case, just
remove the connector block and use an Ink type eraser (it has a small amount 
of grit)
and rub the connector fingers to buff the gold clean again.
If you are replacing wires, I have had some luck with opening the terminal 
crimp and
removing/replacing the wire, but afterward, you have to solder the joint to 
restore the
connection. . .solder is kinda tricky in an environment such as an engine 
compartment,
but once the terminal has been disturbed, you cannot re-crimp the wire 
because the
metal fatigue will cause a failure later *Dont do this*.
Before I go;  to remove a terminal from the ECU housing you have to use a 
small strip
of stout (spring) steel (properly sized -I dont have dim's) and insert it 
into the connector
housing to press the tang to disengage and gently persuade the terminal out 
of the housing
by pulling on the wire at the same time. . .This is not easy unless you have 
the correct
tool for the job.  Sorry I cant be more detailed, but sometimes the tip of 
an X-acto knife
blade can do the job.  Caveat:  your mileage may vary depending on your 
dexterity.

Good Luck,
