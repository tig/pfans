Ok I am starting to forget how sweet driving my 74 2.0 can be... I pulled the
car off the road 6 months ago so I could do some needed work in order to make
it a reliable driver. I replaced the valve seals with the engine in the car
and have had the car up on ramps the whole time. Now I cant get the car off
the ramps. The passenger side does try to turn but the drivers side rear
wheel seems locked somehow ( yes the e-brake is off...). Has anyone seen or
heard of this happening before and if so, How do I get it "unlocked"? I tried
popping the car in and out of gear and that just allowed the passenger side
to pull the car off the ramps. I had my very patient wife watching the car
for me and she was able to verify that the passenger side was moving and the
driver side not..... HELP!!! PLEASE!!!!
