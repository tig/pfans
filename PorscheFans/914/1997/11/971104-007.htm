Well, I wouldn't quite put it that way. Out of the box (meaning stock
with a GOOD running car and chassis), the 914 is a better car. The RX-7
will require alot more sophisticated development work to get going to a
competetive level in anything above stock. Both will significant amounts
of time and money to develop into a capable SCCA street prepared
autoxer. The RX-7 will probably cost more if you don't consider the
restoritive costs involved in prepping a 914. As for fun? Yes, I think
the 914 is more fun. But a well prepped RX-7 is a wild ride, and alot of
fun too. BTW, I know of someone who is selling a fully prepared C-Street
Prepared RX-7. The car took 6th place at nationals this year, and is a
hell of alot of fun to drive. The car is SORTED. It handles very well,
has power galore and revs to spare (9,5000 rpm shift point). If you're
interested, let me know. I'd have bought it if not for two reasons. One:
I'm dedicated to building this 914. And two: I can't afford another race
car. The reason he's selling it? He needs to finance his upcoming
E-Prepared RX-7 road racing endevour.

Yup.

Well geez, that's different. I don't think you mentioned a 911 is
already in the stable. Well, I will say a couple more things. The RX-7
will probably give you more venues for competition, and has shown to be
competetive in SCCA autoxing. The 914 is more fun and rewarding to drive
(from a grins quotient perspective), and is a potential out of the box
competetive car in PCA club racing. If you really want a competetive car
for Solo2, then either join the 914 underground and start building a CSP
car with some of the rest of us, or go the easier route and 'El Duro'
from my friend. It's named 'El Duro' for a very obvious reason... :)
