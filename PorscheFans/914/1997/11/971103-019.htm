I think the numebrs are fairly acuratet.  They would be off from the
numbers taken in a windtunnel.  But I have seen other numbers and the
fact that Sports car graphics numbers where done on 2 different days a
couple months apart help to establish that the testing method is somewhat
acurate.  Of course enviroment differences could changes the numbers if
they did not factor the differences into the reported numbers.

The 914-6 should so less lift and more drag.  Why, more body (engine and
accesories) weight to lift would reduce the numbers alittle.  Second the
914-6 came with 5.5 inch wheels and wider tires, thus producing more drag
than the 914-4 which had 4.5" rims and narrow VW tires.  Less drag, and
friction.

Take care,
