Well, all these years, 30 actually, I thought that I was just a wimp in the
heat. On Saturday, I found out that actually, I get migraine headaches from
the heat. I had always thought that it was just heat exhaustion. 

Me and a friend went up to new jersey in the nonair conditioning bavaria to
buy some alloy wheels for the car. The weather was hot that day, about
100degrees, and humid, too. On the way home I got a headache, felt dizzy,
sound and light bothered me and I felt nauseous. We went to a hospital, and
the doctor asked me a bunch of questions and finally said I was suffering
from a migraine, not heat sickness. I had been drinking plenty of water, but
I couldn't do anything once the migraine hit. 

Go buy some wheels and find myself. What a weekend.
