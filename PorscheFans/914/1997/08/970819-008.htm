I have a 120 mph in mine.  I stripped one with a 150 mph speedo, and
used the tranny in mine.  It did not change the reading on the speedo
therefor I would assume the drive is the same for both. The owner's
manual for my 70(and again I believe they are all the same) says
45mph@2000rpm in fifth.
Electrical problems,
1) Same answer as some other problem I commented on.  Check that all is
grounded well.  If not it could be finding ground through a series of
filaments.
2) I have the same problem with mine. I just assumed it had to do with
the fact that I have a V8 with a delco alternator and internal
regulator.  I have also postulated that it is the diode behind the dash
that has failed.  Is it an intermittent problem?  Mine does it much more
when I start the engine and turn it off almost right away.  I assumed it
had to do with how much the alternator was charging, if it was putting
out enough the system would stay up even though the battery had been
disconnected.
Let me know if you find a solution, as I sometimes have to kill mine
with the clutch.
Peace  Bill S.
