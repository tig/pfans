The simple answer to fix the bureaucrats is volunteering to pay a "smog
tax" in 
lieu of the smog cert fee for all cars over 25 years old.  The owner
should have
the choice of a smog cert or a smog tax.  Even if the tax were much
higher, it
would still be less than the cost of smog test and repairs.

I am not convinced that SB 42 is a good idea.  If some of the early smog
devices
are shown to be ineffective, they should no longer be required.  If CAT 
converters can be fitted, they should be.  I plan to put one on my '73 
914 2.0
before its smog check in Dec.  With its aftermarket exhaust, it is just
a bolt-on.

Maybe a choice of smog cert or smog tax should be available for all
cars.  This
would provide some needed competition to the smog stations.  

Cheers,
