Greetings, 914-er's!

  I have been observing a thread concerning so-called "hot-start
kits" on the list again, and I thought that I'd through in my $.02.  

  First, an additional relay in the starting system is a "band-aid"
approach to fixing a problem... it isn't really the correct way to
go, and adds an additional failure point to the system.  My 914 lives
in the Mojave desert, and it starts just fine, without any additional
relays.

  First, Brian Ng's diagnostic advice is good, except that I think
that it would be better to say that the drop in the starter control
circuit should not be more than a volt or two at the most.  This
would best be measured between the battery positive terminal and the
spade terminal on the starter during cranking.   If the battery is
not fresh, or the starter current drain is excessive, the battery
voltage will drop below 11 volts, and therefore so will the starter
control voltage.  If the drop in the control circuit is excessive,
then either there is excessive resistance in the circuit, or the
starter solenoid windings are low in resistance (partially or fully
shorted).  In either case, there is a definite problem that needs to
be fixed.

  If the voltage at the starter solenoid control terminal is OK and
the starter is still reluctant to engage and spin, remember that
there are two windings in the solenoid, a "pull-in" winding, and a
"hold" winding.  Failure of either will result in starter
difficulties; the correct repair is a replacement starter.  

  Last but not least, there may be difficulties with the motor
windings themselves, or with high resistance in the current path from
the battery to the high-current terminal on the starter.  Again,
repair the wiring or replace the starter as necessary.

  If the entire system is within design limits, the 914 will start
easily and reliably on the hottest or coldest of days.  If the system
is broken, I firmly believe that the correct approach is to find the
problem and fix it.

					Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
