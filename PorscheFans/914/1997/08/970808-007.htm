Could be neither.  Check for leaks around the intake manifolds where
they attach to the heads.  You are using the plastic insulators gaskets,
right??  Have you checked your dwell and timing?  I'm don't know much
about beefed up engines, but its my understanding that a really hot cam
will cause a car not to idle below about 2000 rpm.  Are you using a good
quality (like a Weber x-bar) linkage and are your carbs balanced
properly?

What size venturis, main jets, air correction jets, and idle jets are
you running?  With an engine that big, you probably need 55 idles and
most Webers come setup with 50s.  I could make some pretty educated
guesses at other jet and venturis sizes that would work for you, but
won't be able to back them up with experience on a big engine like
yours.

>My brakes also squeal when I apply them. Is there a way to stop that?

Get some disc brake anti squeal stuff from your FLAPS.  Remove the brake
pads and apply the stuff to the back of the pads where they touch the
shims and also to the shims where they touch the pistons.  If you use
your brakes really hard and heat them up a lot, you may have to do this
a couple times a year - I do.

>Is there a difference in  brake pads?

YES!  A LOT!  My car is an everyday driver and a weekend autocrosser.  I
use Repco Metalmasters ($25/set from Paragon Products) and have been
very happy with them.  They're very affordable and they don't overheat
in the type of driving events that I enter with my stock 2.0.  If you
are a real serious track driver and have big sticky tires, you may want
some even better pads.  Others on this list can provide more info than
me on brake pads.

>Also, how do you know if your master  cyclinder is a 19mm(916) or
stock?

You have to read the stamping on the side of it - it'll either be
stamped 16mm or 19mm.  If you put the car up on jack stands and remove
the steering rack cover from underneath, you can get to the master
cylinder.  You can use a small mirror to see the stamping or you can use
brail and read it by feel.
