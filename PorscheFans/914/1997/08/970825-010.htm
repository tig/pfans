I'd like to put in my application for 'Dumb-ass of the Year' with the
following tale:

Early last week I determined a slight air leak under the throttle body
of my newly installed FI so I removed it and used some gasket sealer
between it and the air box.  At the same time I also replace one of the
bolts that holds it on because the one I had used previously was too
short to thread all the way.  So I got one about an inch longer and put
it in.

(here's where it gets good)

At the point it started to get tight, it felt like it was stripping the
threads.  "S#$T" I said to myself, but it seemed fairly tight so I
decided to let well enough alone.  Next day when I checked again for air
leaks, I found I now had a HUGE one (on the side where the new bolt was
'stripped').  So I removed the throttle body yet again to determine the
difficulty of Heli-coiling the hole.   While I was looking at it, I
realized there was a hole in the air box directly under where the bolt
goes.  The bolt I had used was soooo long that the supposed  'stripping'
was the feeling I was getting as the bolt punctured the airbox!

With stupidity like this, who needs enemies.

BTW, I sealed up the hole.
