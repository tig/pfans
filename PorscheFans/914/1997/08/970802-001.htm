For what it is worth, I have a Crane 700 on my 914 that I would guess is
over 15 years old and have been very satisfied with it. In 1987 I bought an
MG that had this Allison/Crane unit on it. I have no idea when it was
installed. The garage from whom that I bought the car had been holding the
MG on a mechanic's lien for five or more years and had no information about
the car. In 1992 someone tried to drive through the MG rather than around
it and the car was totaled. I called Crane and they gave me the part number
for the shutter to fit my 914's distributor and in fact sent me one after I
could not get anyone to sell me one locally. I moved the 700 to my 914
daily driver and it has been flawless since then. Installation is simple,
just replace the point with the shutter and pickup, mount the power box
(fits nicely on the battery tray support) and hook up three wires. My
timing simply does not change.
