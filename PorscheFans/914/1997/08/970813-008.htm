Dirk responded, "I'm talking about plugs, not grommets. I want to plug up
every body cavity
hole I can find. I'll have to check NAPA for these things."

Sorry bud, I didn't make myself clear.  Plugs are included in what I
said.  Picture the plugs that Porsche puts in those big holes that hide
behind your front bumper.  You can find everything in a grommet (open
center cushioning/sealing device) to a plug (closed/filled center sealing
device) in the places I mentioned previously

At the parts stores around here, they all have a line of gizmos and
gadgets packaged in red blister packed boxes, with the word "HELP" in
white across the top.  Thedistribution company who does this, sells
everything imaginable, it is just up to each retailer which items they
want to carry on their shelves.  I used to work part time for Western
Auto when I was in graduate school, they sold this line of stuff, and I
know that if you access this supplier of helpful stuff, they will get you
anything you want.
