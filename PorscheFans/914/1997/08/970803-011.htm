Firestone Firehawk street tires, Koni adjustable rears (adjusted
'somewhere' in between
soft and hard), 140 lb springs, new 22 mm Weltmeister swaybar just bolted on 
(read NO adjustment yet), and one hell of a hot day with lots of slippery hot
pavement.

I haven't even driven a rear drive car in over 10 years.  And I don't go 
out and get crazy on the street with my 914.  Any little twitch in the rear
of the 
car translates into a very strange feeling for me.

Someday it will be like the rest of the 914's I've witnessed running around
the local
autocross courses, strong and fast.  But for now, I was happy running a
full 5 seconds
off the FTD set by a very fast ex-formula car.  Heck, just a new set of
R1's would
have dropped another 2-3 seconds off!

Maybe I'll get the car 'straightened' out for the next run.
