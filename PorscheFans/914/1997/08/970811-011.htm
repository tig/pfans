All the talk about the Pertronix unit in the past I set out to find a
better solution, and may have found it.  I hate doing points and
condenser replacements.  My auto-x classes will not allow the lose of the
dizzy so I needed to come up with a trigger besides a crank fire unit.

So down to Larry's Off Road I went one day. (My local bubba's bug world.)
 And in the display case in all there glory was my options.  I was like a
kid in the candy store.  They had MSD billet dizzies with magnetic
pickup, the Pertronix unit, and a bunch of stuff from Compu-fire.  Well
there it was an object that made the most sense I have ever seen, the
Compu-fire points replacement unit.  Why does it make sense, well read
on, if you dare.

The Compu-fire module is smaller than the points it replaces.  The
Pertronix is much, mucho, bigger in comparison.  It does not require any
grinding of the case to install.  It drops in just like points do,
actually easier.  The disc with the magnets has a larger overall
diameter, so it is slightly more accurate in its timings. But I don't
think it is a huge thing, just an observation.  Best of all, the advance
plates can travel the full range movement.  Also the unit cost me $65.00
and the Pertronix was $60.00, so for an extra $5.00 I saved having to
grind the box.  I did not think that was to shabby.  

Other observations:

The MSD unit is huge, looks like there standard V8 dizzy adapted to our
little engines.  I don't think it would even fit with the stock fan
housing.  And at $239.00 bucks, plus the need for another module,  I did
not want to even attempt the install.  I do have a budget to keep in. 
They also had a dual coil unit made by Compu-fire that was intriguing,
but at $239 also, I walked away.

So what's the verdict on the Compu-fire, it is a nice product, easy to
install and does its function.  I will not make any claims of better
performances, or the like.  Heck I paid them for the right to install the
product.  Now if they want to give me back my $65.00 plus tax, maybe then
I will say.  Yeah, it shot thru the 1/4 mile 10 second quicker with a 100
MPH improvement thru the traps.  0-60 times where also improved by 3
seconds.  Oh and I forgot, it spun the dyno jet up to 560 hp where the
needle broke, and the 901 launched first gear.  All that from a other
wise stock 914 1.8L engine.  Well,,,, I don't think so Tim!

Just a few notes from a happy customer.

Take care,
