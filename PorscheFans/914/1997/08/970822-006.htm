Quick Refresher:  About 2 months ago I was still struggling with a loose
wire problem in my 914 that was causing some very erratic running.  I
got fed up after trying to figure it out for 3 months, so I shipped it
off to a local "guru".  He fixed the wires within a day, and identified
several intake leaks.  He needed to order some new boots for the intake
runners.  He also discovered that my throttle body was in poor shape, so
he replaced it with a good used one that he had lying around.  He then
discovered that, while the car runs fine off of idle, it is erratically
changing fuel mixture at idle.  

He's now had the car for a full month, and every time I call, he tells
me that he's got other stuff to do, and that he can't get to my car.
This got a little too frustrating today, so I asked if I could pick the
car up, and try to find the erratic idle problem myself, since they're
too busy.  He said sure, so I asked how much it was going to cost.  He
said he'd have to figure it out and call me back, so I asked for a ball
park, and he said that he's got at least 12 hours (at $55/hr) in the car
right now.  That's over $600 to fix some loose wires, replace the
throttle body, and fix two intake leaks.  Its also not including parts
(which will probably total another $100).  I cannot, no matter how much
I try, justify $700 for these repairs.  Am I screwed, or is there some
law that I can refer to save myself from bankruptcy?

Thanks,
