Mark,

This is a re-post from last month:

---------------------

The oil drips on the bottom of the oil filter usually come from one of 2
places:  the oil pressure sender on top of the engine (near the
distributor) or else the cooler seals.  So check the oil pressure sender
first!  Remove the boot, and start the car up.  Look for signs of leakage. 
Tighten the sender, but don't overtighten it, or you'll strip the threads
to the case!  Sometimes the sender itself is faulty, and requires
replacement.

You can also jack up the car on jackstands and *carefully* crawl under the
car with the engine running.  You should be able to see where the oil comes
from.

The oil cooler seals can be replaced with the engine in the car, but the
job is a PITA.  

1.  jack up car on jackstands (just the rear 2 is fine).  Drain oil, remove
filter
2.  remove the nuts that hold the bracket on the cooler (I think they're
13mm, can't remember)
3.  remove the three 10mm nuts that hold the cooler in place.  Don't lose
the 2 washers behind each nut:  a wavy one and a thick flat one.  You will
need a short 10mm wrench, and perhaps a small 1/4" ratchet and socket to
get these 3 babies.  This is the biggest pain.  Look in your Haynes manual
for a picture of where they live.  They're close to the case.  A small
magnet helps quite a bit.

4.  slide cooler towards front of car as much as possible (3/4" or so)
5.  remove old seals
6.  replace seals.  I used a long skinny screwdriver, and stuck the seal in
place with some grease.  You put the seal on the end of the screwdriver
like a lollipop, and feed the thing up there.  Do the top one first.
7.  slide cooler back in place, and replace the 10mm nuts and washers. 
This is a big PITA that took me 10 minutes each.
8.  replace end bracket nuts, replace oil filter, add oil.
9.  start engine, check for leaks (again!)

good luck.  I spend about 0.8-1.0 hours on this job, your mileage may vary.

          Valve Adjustments:

Valve adjustment interval is 6k miles.  If the "ticky ticky" noise from the
lifters is not _even_ sounding (ie, some sound louder than others, ticky
ticky TICKY ticky), you know that one or more of your valves is out of
adjustment.  With practice, the valve adjustment can be done in 15-20
minutes.  For 2.0 engines, 0.006" for intake (inside 2) and 0.008" for
exhaust (outside 2).  For all other VW T-I to T-IV engines, 006 for all
valves. 

cheers, Brian

-----------------

1) I have a leaking Oil Cooler. Do you have to drop or take out the
engine to fix it?  If it's only the seals, how do you know that the oil
cooler is shot?  
2)  I have a oil pressure gauge and what reading should it have?  I have
a additional oil cooer in front of car. My engine is a 2.0 (beefed  to
2.4) with Dual 44 webers & 3/4 cam.  It only has about 10K miles on
rebuilt.  At idle is reads 20 on gauge and never goes past 40-45 at
speeds of 60-65 MPH.  Is that normal?
3) How to you know when to adjust the valves?  Is there a certain noise? 
Thanks, 
I appreciate your time!!!
