Your rear springs may very well be sagging. Replacement with new springs may
give you your inch back. The adjustable spring perch kit you've seen isn't
really made for your KYB units. The standard Koni units have a 3 position
ride height feature on them that would probably meet your needs rather than
going with the adjustable spring perch kit.  The kit is great for corner
weighting and more precise ride height adjustments, but I don't think you'll
probably need it in your situation.
