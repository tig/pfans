Finally, someone who has something positive to say about carburetors!

There are several books about weber carbs, and they are a must have in my
opinion to really understand how to set them up. You have to start with
basic things like what venturi size should I use? (yes, you can change your
venturis!) Then you move on to jet sizes, et al. Weber lists several setup
specifications for thier carburetors. It's considered a good starting point.
With today's gas, you have to expect to need to use different jetting than
what they recommend.

You have smog testing on old cars in kentucky?? I thought you people had
really clean air. I'm glad to here that you got your 914 through your smog
test with carburetors. What was the standard for HC and %CO? I have to meet
600ppm HC and 6% CO. I have no idea if this is hard to do or not. 

Considering my car isn't even back on the road, and my registration expires
in 1999, I have some time to think about these things.
