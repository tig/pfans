Bravo! Welcome to the family!

Nope, except for the badging and optional equipment, the chassis is
identical.

You already said it, "With the cam...". An agressive cam will never idle
smoothly, fact of life. Now I don't know exactly what an "H" cam is, but
I'm guessing it's not mild. If your timing is set, check your mixture
and carb jetting.

For a stock 1.8, yes that sounds right. But who knows what you've really
got in there.

Disconnect the vacuum lines before setting the timing. Then reconnect
when done.

Something you should already have if the car is/was a '75. On early
914s, they used the very same tranny case that the 911s used and as such
the shift linkage entered on the very end of the box. On the 911, this
was great as the box pointed forward, but the 914 is set up in the
reverse direction and as such they (Porsche) needed to extend the shift
linkage all the way to the back of the car and it had to go though a few
bends and joints. The unfortunate result was a VERY sloppy shifter. In
'73 they resolved this problem by moving the linkage forward to the side
of the case. The shorter linkage and fewr direction changes drastically
improved the accuracy of the shifting.

The popping sound, does it happen you lift off the gas? If so, it's your
carb setup. You may have a rich overrun condition that's allowing the
engine to suck in too much fuel when the throttle plate closes. But
double check your exhaust bolts and joints.

Well find out what you've got now for starters. Chances are, your carbs
are simply badly tuned, giving you popping, rough idle, and rich
running.

What kind of exhaust system do you have? It sounds to me like you have a
tuned header, and not the factory heat exchangers.
