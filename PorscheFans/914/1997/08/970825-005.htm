JJ, I just finished helping a friend put on his FI (Mike Gensler, list
member).  His biggest problem once the vac leaks were found were bad
injector points, check out his recent post.  Your injectors may be firing
to much causing your car to run much to rich.  Try new injector points.
Yes they are expensive.  But I have talked to several people that cured FI
problems by puting in new FI points.
