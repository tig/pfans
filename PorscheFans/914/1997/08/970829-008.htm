Stephen is certainly right about the MoTec, if you're independently
wealthy. MoTec is not cheap. Expect to pay upwards of $2.5k for a MoTec
system. And that's just for the MoTec hardware, that does not include
injectors, manifolds, throttle-bodies etc. The lesser price systems are
not neccessarilly inferior. Accel and Haltec are both exceptional
systems that can do pretty much what you want them to. What you're
paying for in the MoTec (as I understand it) is the ease of programming
and compatibility with sensors. The MoTec package usually comes complete
with sensors. Electromotive is also a very flexible system, but is not
as easy to program. All of the above allow for data logging and laptop
serial port interface.
