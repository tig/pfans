> To post a message, send e-mail to 914@PorscheFans.comI would add that powdercoating creates a better bond between the paint 
and part, because the bond is created on a molecular 
level...powdercoating that gets scratched never creates rust beyond the 
actual exposed metal.

Also, powdercoating would be a better choice for hot parts (ie brake 
calipers), because heat is used in the bonding process.

I don't think painted brakes look geeky at all!
