Remember I quizzed Rich a while back about driving to work in Ol' Yeller?
 Well, on the way in to work this morn, traffic was backed up from about
10 car lengths before the MCI turn off at Lookout Dr., all the way to my
house, on Plano Rd., southbound.  That's three lanes for about a quarter
of a mile.  That is highly unusual, since I leave late on purpose
(usually around 8:30 or so) so that the traffic will have died down (you
telecom nuts can get pretty feisty driving to work, and I avoid the
tempers  :-] :-] :-]   ).  It usually works, but not today.

Well, I utilized the standard flanking maneuver.  Left lane all the way
until the last minute and then dart over for the turn in at Greenville
Ave.  Don't you know that as I passed the congestion-causer I caught a
glimpse of what it was.  A Good Samaritan had parked his Volvo wagon with
flashers on (to keep other idiots from hitting them), he had gotten out
of his car and was helping a poor soul push his YELLOW with Minilites 914
UP hill the ten car lengths to get it out of the way, at the turn off for
MCI at Lookout!!!  Now, a 914 is a light vehicle, but up hill, anything
gets to feel like the weight of the world.  Since I was jammed in the far
left lane, have a broken toe, and had way too many vehicles between me
and them, I decided to pass on the opportunity to help a fellow
fourteener.  I felt so bad for those two little fellows, they WERE really
puffin'.  I hope they were safe.  I know one of them was concerned about
protecting his little jewel of a car, but life and limb can get injured
real easily in this rush hour stuff.

The whole situation reminded me of Damp Dave Darling back in the early
spring.  We 914 people can be a stubborn lot when it comes to operatin'
in the wet.  Ah, for the love of Porsches :-)  And, I loved Dave Colman's
parallel comparisons of a 914 and a Boxter in the latest "Excellence". 
That IS all a Boxter reminds me of (not a 550 RSK).  A 914, after 20-some
years of evolution.  It's as if the 914 never went away now.  Kinda like
the 911 GT Evo.  The neat part is the we are just starting the cycle of
Porsche AG fiddeling with the beast.  It will really be something to
behold in competition as the years develop.

I'll bet those two little guys I saw this morn can't wait to get their
hands on a Yellow Boxter (to drive - not push) !!!
