914ers,

The other day, half way through the autox, I noticed cracking and popping
coming from the tailpipe while I was idling on the staging grid.  Most
noticably while decelerating after hitting the throttle.  I also noticed a
slight power loss in the low to mid-range acceleration off of the line.
Once I buried the pedal, the car would get up and go (as only 914's can :) ).

I got it back home, and started going over everything.  I changed the
plugs, checked the timing, made sure all of the wires were tight.  I even
took out the Pertronix unit I recently put in and put the points and
condensor back on.  Still no luck.  Finally, I tightened down the intake to
head nuts, and found all 6 were about 1/2 to 3/4 turn loose.  The intake to
carb nuts are all tight.  Still no luck.

Can someone give me a little direction here?  It's hard for me to tell, but
I don't see any fuel leakage around the intake to head seal, and the seal
itself is only about 3 months and 100-200 miles old.  Oh yeh, 009 Bosche
distributor and dual Webers (also 3 months old).

Thanks for any advice you can offer.

Dion
