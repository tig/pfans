I wonder if there are many 911 drivers that keep really nice 914's "in
the
>closet"?
>

Well I guess some of us need to come out of the "closet". 

I admit that I do in fact have both a 914 and a 911 targa.  I use the
911 for extended road trips and calling on business's. The bigger
heavier 911 is much easier on the body on longer hauls and to be honest
it makes a hell of an appearance impression on potential clients. A 911
just plain makes one look sucessfull, even if in fact your scratchen for
feed like everyone else. However for just general seat of the pants
tearing around and some gut level fun there is no comparison to the 914.

I guess I came from the old school of sports cars, early Austins, MG's,
Datsuns, Etc. Four tires, stiff suspension, couple of seats, Tach, Temp,
and oil gauges, (speedometer optional equipment), strap in and go.  Feel
every pebble, bump and crack in the road. Come home pick the bugs out of
your teeth from grining so much, open the hood and spend the next few
hours diddling with most anything under there.

I was going to give the 914 to my son to use....he better start shopping
around for his own.

Count me in as a new rabid convert. I admit I used to sneer at the 14's
as a glorified VW. You can still teach an old dog new tricks.
