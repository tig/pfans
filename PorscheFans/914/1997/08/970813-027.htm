In the October issue of Excellence Magazine, there appears an article by
David Coleman entitled =93=91Bad Ride=92 Track-side=94 which compares the=
 914 to the
986 Boxster.  The article rightly points out that the 914 is the spiritua=
l
ancestor of the Boxster, something which Porsche is ashamed to admit.  No=
ted
in the article is the 914=92s superb reputation as an autocross car, as w=
ell as
a road car.  The problem that I have with the article is that the author
takes a clear shot at the 914 before he gives it any credit at all.  Whil=
e
discussing Porsche=92s attempt to ignore the 914, he states =93the 914 is=
 the
automotive equivalent if Carl Malden=92s nose.  Effective, but ugly as si=
n.=94

Here=92s a topic for anyone who is tired of the 914 being the general =93=
whipping
boy=94 of  Porsche automotive jounalists:  Why does it seem that each jou=
nalist
is obliged to take a shot at the 914 before they can give it any acclaim?
 The 914 has been criticized for just about every aspect of the car.  Yet=
,
for each of the qualities which the 914 is put down for, there has been
another Porsche that has had these same qualities, yet was accepted. =20

The contradictions make their arguments mute, if you really think about i=
t.
 The only logical explanation for the 914=92s mistreatment by the automot=
ive
media is as follows:  The 914 was introduced at a time when Porsche=92s i=
mage
was being radically changed from that of an interesting German car made f=
or
motoring enthusiasts to an image of a car made for the elite, a luxery ca=
r
for arrogant snobs.  The 914, being incompatible with this new image was
attacked by the American car loving media, especially the guys at Road &
Track - and Porsche caved in.  Now Porsche tries to sweep the car under t=
he
rug - visit their website, they give one line to the 914 in their =93Hist=
ory=94
section.

A few years back, In the late 80's we read that Porsche 914 prices were
expected to escalate, similar to the 356 trend.  Well, since the 914
continues to get mistreated by the media, and ignored by Porsche, it is n=
o
wonder that this escalation has not taken place to any significant degree.

Oh well, just had to get that off my chest.
