I'm new to the 914 Digest.   I've been a bonafide 914 junkie for about a
year now.  I have a '73 914 that I've been restoring, and I have
recently rebuilt the engine.  The engine was a 1.7 with 1.8 heads.  I
added a big bore kit with 96mm pistons, a SCAT cam, bearings, rings, new
lifters, new lifter adjusting screws, new valve springs, new intake(or
was it exhaust? - whichever you normally replace) valves in the heads,
heavy duty oil pump, dual IDF 44 Webers, new clutch, pressure plate,
flywheel, 1st/reverse, heat exchangers, and had all the rotating parts
balanced.  The only moving parts on the inside of the engine that I
didn't replace are the crank, rods, and valve push rods.  The valve push
rods were all checked for trueness by me, and they didn't appear to be
warped or worn.  $$$$ WHEW..... The engine was run at 3500 RPM when it
was first started for 20 minutes, just like the cam instructions said.
It screams compared to what it did with the stock 1.7 with a 2-barrel
Weber.  BUT... the valves rattle to beat hell, and they've been adjusted
twice, once by a real mechanic, and once by me.   When the "real
mechanic" adjusted the valves and the engine was still kind of noisy, he
said I should drive it for a while (800-1000 miles) since the engine was
fresh, and then adjust the valves again.   I did and it's still noisy,
but it seems to quiten a little(some..not much)  after it warms up.  As
a matter of fact the engine was never as quiet as any 914 I've ever
heard, even before the rebuild.   I've checked the timing with a light,
and it's right on.    Here's the procedure I used to adjust the valves.

Cold motor.  Loosen the plugs.  I built a gauge out of paper with 90
degree marks that could be positioned and fixed on  the distributor
under the rotor so the rotor can be aligned at a 90 degree mark on TDC
for every cylinder.    Get the rear of the car on ramps.  (I use a
railroad cross-tie sawed in half at an angle with a chain saw.  You get
two indestructible ramps that will last forever.)  Find TDC on #1
cylinder by bumping the car in gear(3rd) aligning the impeller fan  '0'
mark in the V notch on the block.    Adjust the valve clearance on both
valves for  #1 cylinder to .007".  While still in gear, bump the car
backwards on the ramps until the distributor rotor is pointing directly
to the next 90 degree mark to the left of TDC for #1.  This is supposed
to be TDC for #2.  Ditto adjustment for #2, #3, #4.   From what I've
read this is the correct procedure.  AM I DOING THIS RIGHT????  DOES
ANYONE HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS?  IS THERE A BETTER  WAY, OR DO I FIND
ANOTHER REAL MECHANIC??
