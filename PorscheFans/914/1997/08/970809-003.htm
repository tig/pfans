This is a re-send of an old post.  Thought you newbies could learn or
add to it:

       SMOG GOODIES AND EXHAUST BACKPRESSURE   part 1 of ..

       No, this is not about beans.  It is some data in my semi-
       scientific study aimed toward getting faster acceleration.
       Acceleration is f/m, or force divided by mass.

       First, I am on a diet.  I am also looking at other ways to reduce
       the weight of my '76 914 2.0, like lighter bumpers, etc.

      Next is force, or power.  Since my California 914 has all the smog
       goodies like Air Injection (smog pump), EGR (Exhaust Gas
       Recirculation), and a CAT or catalytic converter, it seemed smart
       to start there.  Of course it is "common knowledge" that the smog


       things rob power, but by how much?  I've never seen numbers, just
       rumors.  Combined they weigh less than fifteen pounds, so that is
       no big deal.

       As you might expect, the EGR ports exhaust gas from just ahead of
       the muffler into the fresh air intake.  The hot, oxygen-less air
       would really rob power, but it ports that gas only at partial
       throttle: low-moderate power settings.
       It does not affect WOT (Wide Open Throttle) power.

      The smog pump pushes fresh air into the cylinder heads in the area
       between the valves and the exhaust manifolds.  This adds to the
       backpressure, which is a big power robber.  I don't yet know if
       the smog pump works full time, or just when the engine is cold,
       but I will measure it soon.

       As you know, backpressure is the resistance to air flow in the
       exhaust system.  Backpressure prevents the cylinder from being
       emptied of hot exhaust gas, and therefore limits the amount of
       fresh air that can be drawn in on the next stroke; as well as
       overheating, etc.

      Power loss due to backpressure is dramatic.  I once bought a '79
      VW Van with a supposed bad engine, as the PO said it just didn't
      have any power.  When I rebuilt the engine, I found wear, but
      nothing unusual.  After re-installing the engine, it started right
       up, but would not turn more than 2,000 rpm -- in neutral!  The
       usual checks of the EFI revealed nothing.  Then I dismantled the
       exhaust and found the CAT was clogged.  It ran perfect with a new
       CAT.

       My '76 914 barely failed the initial smog check when I bought it
       last year.  I then looked, and found the CAT had been gutted.
       Since the original 914 CAT is $1K, if even available, I installed
       an aftermarket CAT for an '81 Vanagon.  It is a good fit, and it
       is a three-way unit, I believe, which does an even better job.
       The car then passed with flying colors.  To my amazement, I could
       not detect any reduction in power with the CAT installed.

      Sometime in the past year I removed the CAT, thinking it had to be
       robbing power.  Again, there was no noticeable difference.  It is
       now smog check time again.  Since the CAT was already off, and I
       am kinda lazy, I tried leaning the mix and went for a smog.  The
       idle failed with 3.0% CO, and was showing 6% O2, but with almost
      no HC. I should have left the mix at best power and maybe it would
       have passed..  Instead, I got inspired to experiment.

       This car has a Bursch Quiet Street exhaust system with dual glass
       packs, and a single muffler after the CAT.  Its age or internal
       condition is unknown, but it sure sounds nice.

       The smog ports allow me to take measurements that are not
      otherwise practical to get in cars like my '73 914.  The other day
       I removed the hose from the smog pump to the check valve, and
       temporarily installed a pipe fitting in the collector tube.  This
       point combines the backpressures of the four cylinders, making
       possible good readings that are well averaged.  While it is not
       capturing peak or minimum presssures, it is a very good baseline,
       and something I have never seen in writing.

       From that pipe fitting, I ran a hose to the cockpit where I
      mounted a war surplus Manifold Pressure gauge.  The MP gauge reads
       from 0 to 50 inches of mercury, 29.5 inches being ambient at that
       time on that day.

       I made several runs at WOT up to 5,800 rpm in second gear.
       I recorded the tach pulses, which I will decode later to get
       acceleration and power curves.  I also watched the MP gauge, and
       to my amazement, the backpressure went up to 35.5 inches.  I did
       not dream that BP from such a nice sounding exhaust would be 20%
       of ambient.  Could this be a 20% power loss?!

       I then removed the gutted CAT and installed the good one.
       Again, I was amazed by the results:  only 1/2 inch more
       backpressure.  It didn't feel any different, but it is quieter.
       FINDING:  good CATs don't rob power.

       Tuned for best power, and with all smog toys working, my car
       passed today with:          Measured      Max
                         HC (ppm)     10         150
                         CO %          0.01        1.2
                         O2 %          1.6

       If only our SoCal air were this clean...

       My next steps will be to measure backpressure at the EGR and oxy
       sensor ports to find the bottleneck.  With the CAT doing some
       muffling, I can reduce the secondary muffler for sure.  I also
       intend to measure performance vs backpressure.

       Do you have any hard data to add?

          Don't trust air you can't see.  
	  You might step outside someday and just plink over,
          'cause there's no air.

      To be continued...
