I agree.  You need to replace those pieces whatever it takes.  Basically
every piece on there is critical to the cooling.  See some of the Bob
Hoover sermons on the web for more info about cooling, critical air,  etc.
Lots of people will tell you various things about the cooling tin, flaps,
etc.  Lots of 'mechanics'  will say you don't need this piece or that.

I go with, they don't know better than the engineers who designed the
engines.  The companies wouldn't put a piece on there if not absolutely
necessary.  Companies try to cut pennies wherever they can, i.e. the Pinto
and a couple of bolts near a gas tank.  If it was originally on there you
need it.

Mine is like yours at the moment.  I just got  the flaps put back, left off
by the PO's 'mechanic'.  I'll be putting back the cable and bellows as soon
as I get one more piece.  The flaps are held open by the spring.  The
bellows helps the engine come up to operating temperature in the time they
designed for the best expansion rates of the materials in the engine.
Without the bellows it takes longer to get to operating temp, the materials
expand slower, etc.  Over a long period this may decrease the life of the
engine, short term probably no problem.

I'm assuming that you forgot to put one of the front pieces back in,
right?  If it's one of the back pieces, you should have no trouble
getting it on with the pistons, cylinders, and heads re-assembled.  If
it's the front piece, then don't worry, I did the same thing.  It's a
little work, but you can just take the fan housing off to get the front
pieces on.  There isn't another way, unless you want to pull the heads
and cylinders again.  I would definitely recommend putting all sheet
metal back on, and making sure that any holes are sealed as well as you
can get them.  The quantity of air flowing around the cylinders is a
very important part of not only keeping the engine cool, but getting any
sort of longevity out of it.  The PO of my car completely removed the
bellows and cable (the accordion-type thermostat), and for the last two
years I've been running full-open.  I haven't noticed any problems, but
once again, it was put there for a good reason, so if you can get it
fixed, I'd do so.  Good to hear about your rings - I'm suffering the
same smoking problem after I changed my rings, so with any luck mine
will follow suit.

Hope this helps,
