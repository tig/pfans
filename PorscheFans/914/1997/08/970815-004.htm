Well, I got the fuel pump relocated to the front last night and replaced
the 5/16" rubber hoses with 7mm oem German braided hose and the vapor
lock problem went away.  So I thought, "Cool.  Now I can drive it
again", right?  WRONG!

It seems I've only just cleared the first obstacle - that of getting
everything attached and (more or less) functioning.  Now I have to begin
the process of tinkering and tuning.

Here's my current, most obvious problem:  Everytime I open up the
throttle, I leave clouds of gas smoke behind me.  Doesn't matter if I'm
sitting still in the garage or taking off from a stop light or
accelerating  from 55 - 70 on the highway, big clouds of smoke billow
out my tailpipe.  Also very evident and probably directly related is a
severe lack of low - mid range (2000-4000 rpm) power.  Once the rpms get
over 4000 and up into the mid-upper 4ks, it seems to pull very well.

My conclusion?  A major rich condition, but only when going from small
throttle to full throttle.  When I hold the throttle constant (tested
mostly in the garage, but appears to be true on the street also), it
looks fine, no smoke, but as soon as I 'floor' it again, tons of smoke.
I've have leaned the system out as much I can without causing it to
lean-hunt using the potentiometer installed between the temp sensor 2
and the harness.

Solution?  Heck if I know.  Any suggestions on where to start would, as
always, be greatly appreciated.
