A first time lurker post...

If it can in any way help... I recently upgraded my entire stereo system
after many months of planning.  Here's what worked for me: I added a
subwoofer box into the footwell of my '74 2.0 similar to what Brian did
(I wish I would have known about his install before I did mine) I used
an 8" Boston RS8 and built a 3 sided box totally out of 3/4" MDF and
sealed it onto the interior wall (which I added a layer of Dynamat to). =20

**Mike M.-Depending on how big those cables are you may be able to seal
them within the box. The weatherstripping around the outside of the unit
would certainly accomodate a "normal" thickness of cable.**

The box takes up 1" of legroom but the sound improvement is HUGE! I then
added seperate tweeters on top of the dash pointed towards my big ole
ears.

The Pioneer Premier GM-X404 4 channel amp is mounted upsidedown,
underneath the spare tire panel in the front trunk. This way you don't
lose any room or even notice it until you pick up the panel (it fits
nicely into the space vacated by the spare tire rim). It is also easily
removeable for Auto-X events.  The Motorola AM/FM radio was replaced
with a Pioneer Premier DEX-P88 which is a AM/FM single CD player that
has provisions to control either Pioneer multi CD box and has a built-in
alarm! Just remove the face plate when exiting the car and it arms the
alarm.  If the alarm is tripped a horrible noise is sent through the
speakers.  You can wire up an external (traditional alarm type) speaker,
but I think that would be overkill (you can also disable the ignition).
Installation of all components was straightforeward with one exception.
The amp has a diagram on it for the wiring of the speakers, it's wrong.=20
The correct diagram is in the manual.  Strange but true!

(shameless plug section) please excuse the intrusion into an otherwise
marketing free area?!

I have documented all of the above along with a complete tune up
(including valve adjust), H-4 headlight install, front and rear shock
and spring change, rust prevention tips, Weltmeister front sway bar
install, electric windshield washer install, and a great deal more on
video in a soon to be released tape entitled "The Fundamental 914".=20
There are also interviews with Steve Compton - SCCA Auto-X Champ(914),
Ed Dugan - PCA Parade Concours Champ(914) plus lots of fun 914 footage.=20
It is basic (hence the name) information for new and old 914 owners and
enthusiasts alike.

I've been a 914 owner for over 5 years now and since my real job is
Feature Producer/Photographer for major networks and cable stations, I
thought I would document all of the upgrades I (and a host of other
owners) thought were necessary for a 914 in the 90's. Due to my
overwhelming emotional attachment towards the 914, this compilation of
information may be the most overproduced automotive videotape on the
planet.  There is no lack of production value here either as there are
animations, special effects and extensive use of =93point of view=94
cameras.

I hope to have the tape ready to go by the Sept. 12 Renegade Club
Reunion in Branson, even though I won't be able to attend.  More details
on price and availability as we get closer to that date.

A word of thanks is due to many of the people who post on this list,
your interest and enthusiasm has helped keep this project alive!

Sorry for the extended use of bandwidth, if I'm not flamed too badly,
I'll post more information when the tape is shipping.

Thanks!

<<<<Hi all!
<<<<I was poking around the stereo pages on Brian Ng's web page

<<<<Well, I peeled my carpet back and removed the foam and saw what=20

<<<<is this, what exactly is this thingy and can I relocate it so that
