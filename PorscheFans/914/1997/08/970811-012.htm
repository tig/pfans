I've been having a problem with my shift linkage for a while that has
suddenly gotten much worse.  At first, moving the shift lever to the left
far enough to engage first or reverse took a fair bit of force.  I
figured this was normal and didn't worry about it.  The linkage was also
extremely sloppy, but most of that has been fixed by replacing one of the
shift linkage bushings.  However, in the past week following that
replacement, I've gone from having to exert lots of effort to get 1st or
reverse to being completely unable to get them.  As far as I can tell
from underneath the car, the engine mount bar is too low.  This is a '74
transmission and mount bar with a '71 engine sitting on top of it.  When
the linkage tries to rotate to get 1st or reverse, it hits the bottom of
the mount bar.  

I think my options for fixing this are (1) replace the transmission
mounts and hope that lifts the linkage up enough to clear the bottom of
the motor mount bar, or (2) put a few spacing washers between the top of
the motor mount bar and the bottom of the chassis where it attaches.  It
seems to me that (1) is the better way to fix the problem assuming that
the transmission mounts are the source of the problem (I didn't think to
check them until a few minutes ago), but (2) is more likely to get the
car back on the road again sooner.  Any thoughts/suggestions on other
options, things I've missed, or dire warnings?
