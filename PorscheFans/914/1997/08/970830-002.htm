Yeh, but then it sounds like an RX7!  

I also have thought about this conversion.  I've done some cosmetic work on
a 12A motor in my Brother's 1985 RX7 which he autocrosses in our club.  We
took the airconditioner out, the smog pump and all related lines and hoses,
and installed a freeflow stainless exhaust getting rid of all 3 cat
converters (only one does anything). We also have some full-time RX7 nuts
in the club where I could tap into a wealth of information.  The best thing
about those little motors is the rev limit.  These things live to be driven
at redline; my Brother will drive through the slaloms with the rev-limiter
buzzer going off the whole way, and he says the car still wants to accelerate!

Maybe someday, but I still can't get over the sound...
