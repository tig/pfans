     Hi All,
     
     
        Well, this isn't intended to brag and show off my foolishnes 
     (financial) about my '76 914 2.0 to '76 914 3.0 project.  I thought I 
     might just be able to trade a few ideas.  So here goes:
     
     1) obtained '73 911S Front Suspension w/brakes
     2) rebuilt entire '76 914 brake system w/ 19mm Master Cylinder        
            (rebuilt calipers will be for sale)  [still drive car daily]
     3) obtained '86 928 Front Calipers, am designing adapters, will have 
                Dad who is retired machinist/welder make them from    
                stainless.
     4) buying 10 wheel studs for conversion of extra set of '73 rear 914 
                hubs to 5-lug (yes '72 and older have bosses cast in, see   
                above Dad to  rectify that situation) 
     5) replacing battery tray and small panel at base of windshield and 
                base of front hood seal tray for minor rust repair, have    
                TIG welder will travel, no BONDO allowed!
     6) obtained '83 911SC 3.0 Bosch KH CIS engine complete w/ injection 
                and full exhaust system w/ only 45K miles on it.
     7) obtained Patrick Motorsport Flywheel to adapt 3.0 SC engine to 901 
                 transaxle as part of engine purchase deal
     8) obtained Bursch 1 5/8" 914/6 headers, am designing/ fabricating 
                heater boxes for them, entire weldment will be Jet Coated 
                when complete.  Also designing adaption to Catalytic 
                Converters since this car must meet CA. emissions standards 
                for the '83 engine
     
        Still need sheetmetal, oil tank, oil cooler, engine mount, etc. 
     Have enough work to keep busy in (little) spare time for the rest of 
     this year.  My goal is to disable the fully operational '76 only 
     temporarily to fit items during the fab. Will completely rebuild the 
     suspension from 911 before installion. Have extra set of '73 trailing 
     arms I will reinforce since they are conveniently out of car right 
     now.  Will install chassis stiffening kit at later date. 
        My goal is to build the '76 914/6 that Porsche never did.  It is 
     meant to have the look and feel of the '76 911 of the time, even 
     though the power plant is of course from the next generation of cars.
     I am partial to the 16" BBS wheels with the gold blacked out but 
     retaining the chrome/polished rims.  My car is sunflower yellow and 
     has black on chrome 4-lug Enkei's right now and I like the look.  The 
     car will retain the 5 MPH bumpers since their added weight has already 
     saved my behind in a fender bender with no damage to car.  This will 
     be autocrossed occassionally, but primarily will be optimized for 
     comfortable and safe street use.
        I have the fortune to have a father who is a retired machinist and 
     has been taking welding courses for the last two years to keep his 
     mind sharp.  We've just completed a '36 x '36 shop with three 
     car-sized bays for some serious auto-work.  The shop is fully equipped 
     with Vertical Mill, Engine Lathe, Drill Presses, Grinders, TIG, Oxy. 
     Acytelene, and MiG Welding.  This car has always been a dream of mine, 
     and I went out and got a Mechanical Engineering Degree to give myself 
     the design tools I would need to do it "right".  After being initiated 
     to Dr. Porsche's designs via hotrodding VW Beetles, and mastering the 
     Bosch-D Fuel Injection system via "Tim's 914 Fan Page F.I. Guide", as 
     well as the Bosch/Bentley bible on F.I. , I'm ready to go at it and 
     make this car scream.
     
     
     So that's my update, will keep the list informed when new and excting 
     progress is made.
