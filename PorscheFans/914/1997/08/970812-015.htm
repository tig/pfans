Brian,

I'm wondering about your Empi 8s (or is the emphasis on "-style").  I
thought I'd heard "Empis" (not sure which variety) were lighter than
stock Fuchs.  Also heard the same about Pedrinis (but cast not forged,
right?). 

Also, did you really mean you get better grip out of the Empis vs. Fuchs
given the same size R1s (or were you comparing w/ the 195 Dunlops)? Do
you get a bigger contact patch with the Empis because they're a
different width e.g. not 5.5", or is the 1/4" backspacing the point
because of 1/2" wider track?

Thanks.  Thwen.
