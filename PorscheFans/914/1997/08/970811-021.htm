  I presume that the gearbox, being a '74, is a "side-shifter".  If
so, then I should tell you that on our '74 side-shifter, the front
engine mounting cross bar has a hole in it on the left side.    (So
does another bar that I have from a '75).  The shift linkage rod is
supposed to go THROUGH the hole.   From your description, it sounds
as though you have the shift linkage incorrectly assembled, with the
shift rod routed BELOW the bar.  Is this correct?   If so, then you
should only have to re-route the rod through the hole to correct all
your problems.  If the hole is not present, I would say that you do
not have a side-shifter mounting bar, and you should try to obtain
one with a hole in it.   

  By the way, I believe that it is possible to mount the bar to both
the engine and the chassis the wrong way around; that is, with the
hole on the right.  In this event, everything fits except the shift
rod.  If this is the case with your car, it is easily corrected. 
Remove the shift rod, support the engine, unbolt the bar and turn it
around so the hole is on the left side of the car, and bolt it back
up.  Then re-route your shift rod as above.

  Of course, if your gearbox is a tail-shifter, (I thought not
installed on '74 and later) then disregard everything I said; I have
never seen the tail-shifter linkage.
 
   Anyone else have any comments?
