O.k.. Most of you know my possition on V8 conversions, or any
waterpumper conversion for that matter. However, if one is interested in
making a trully weird and wild beastie. Go Wankel! You can get a
Sh*tload of power out of a 13B rotory motor with a programable injection
system, especially if you port it. And the low end torque is low enough
that it won't strip first gear off the shaft in a 901 box. The best part
about it? You never have to shift! Run that sucker up to 10k rpm! I
would hazzard a guess and say you could easilly get around 300hp out of
a street port 13B with a programable injection system. This is just a
guess based on the RX-7 I had a chance to drive at the Tour and Trails
events last week. This car, which has nothing more than a stock 13B
motor and TEC2 Fuel Injection, now puts out 228HP at sea level! That's
175 HP/Liter! And you never have to shift! Well, ok, I had to shift once
or twice for the tight turns at the track. But where my 914 would be
fully wound out in 4th gear, this RX-7 was still hauling a** in 3rd gear
with more revs to spare. And keep in mind that this was an _unported_
motor. A street port or bridge port is capable of generating scary
amounts of power out of these nearly indestructable little motors. And
another plus, they weigh next to nothing. Where an american V8 weighs
_considerably_ more than a flat six, the 13B is a tiny motor and weighs
a mere 250lbs! That's 25lbs _less_ than the Type IV motor.

Imagine it though. Light weight, power and more power, revs to the
stratosphere, and all in the handling package of a 914! Yeah! >:)

O.k. I guess I've said my peice. Can you tell that I love these motors?
Unfortunately, that's not for me right now unless I decide to switch
cars. I started the 'teener as a project for a specific class, and I
intend to see it through. So it's type IV for me...
