I'm not sure what your symptoms are since I'm new to this discussion
group, and I didn't see Round #1,  but I'd suspect that you get no
starter turnover intermittently when you hit the key, but your car will
push start just fine, making your friends call it a Pusche.  I had this
problem until George Hussey of AutoAtlanta suggested I add a hot start
kit to my starter.  The problem was solved for several months until the
Voltage Regulator started acting flaky.  Make sure you check the charge
rate at your battery once you get the car started, and that it's putting
out about 13.5 volts while running.   After it's run for a while check
it again.  My car would run on a hot battery for some time without the
lights on, even when the voltage regulator was wacko.  I bought a
Borg/Warner voltage regulator at Pep Boys for about $29.  It doesn't
look stock but it works.  The hot start kits can be had from other
places than Auto Atlanta also.  They generally run about $20.  With the
hot start kit, and the VR replaced, I've not had any more starting
problems.
