  I'm sure that everyone on the list has their own opinion on this,
but my $.02 worth is that electronic ignition confers two benefits:
1. It is more efficient at high RPM, and  2. It means never having to
replace the points / condenser again.  This also means that the
ignition performance is more consistent over the life of a tune-up,
not degrading as the points approach the end of their useful life.

What

  The throttle switch must be in good repair and also adjusted
properly.  The popping on deceleration is usually a symptom of
running too rich;  there is a direction detector switch part in the
TPS that disables the opening enrichment (equivalent to a
carburettor's accelerator pump) when letting off.  If this is
defective, you could get extra enrichment on deceleration.  Also, the
contacts that tell the EFI control unit that the throttle is closed
to the idle position may not be closing, either due to a defect or to
improper adjustment of the switch position.  The hesitation on
starting out is usually a symptom of  injection operation WITHOUT the
throttle switch, because of the opening enrichment device mentioned
above.   It is possible that someone adjusted your manifold pressure
sensor or added resistance in series with your temp sensor II to
artificially richen up the mixture to compensate for a supposed bad
(and disconnected) throttle switch, and now that you have reconnected
it, you are running too rich on acceleration.

  Anyone else have any guesses?
