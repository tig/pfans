	Be careful about removing and reinstalling this.  The steel
sensor threads into the aluminum head, and can strip out the threads
pretty easily.  BTDT.  It is theoritecally possible to helicoil with
the engine still installed.  Theoretically.
	My mechanic told me that he gets the car all the way hot to pull
those out.  The heat makes the Al expand more than the steel.  It will
also weaken the threads, so VERY CAREFUL!
	A good tool for the R&R is a deep 13mm socket with a notch cut
into the bottom part.  You put the wire through the notch, then put the
ratchet or extension or whatever into the socket.
	A guy here at work used a grinder to make the notch in mine.  I
had to touch it up with the Dremel--took a LOT longer to touch-up a
small amount than the real tool took to do most of the work.

	The gauge will go to zero PSI (or very low) if the car is vapor-
locking.  What is happening is that the pump can't pump a gas nearly as
well as a liquid.  The fuel heats up enough to boil into a gas, and when
the gas is in the pump it tends to stay there.  The cool-down gets some
of the gas to condense back into a liquid, plus there may be some gravity-
feed or flush effect.  Cycling the pump can help to push this lower amount
of gas out of the pump because there's more liquid in there now.
	Anyway, yes.

	Unhook the throttle cable from the arm on the butterfly valve.  If
the idle drops, then all you have to do is adjust the linkage.  If it still
takes hand pressure to get it to drop, then you need to check the springs.
If the springs still have some snap in them, then you may need to talk to
RD Rick who has one or two of Mike Cooley's re-done throttle bodies.
	Or talk to me, I have some 74+ (vacc retard only) throttle bodies
in unknown condition that I'll sell pretty cheap.

>5.  Can anyone tell me how/when the decel valve works?

	When a very high vaccuum shows up on the small line, a valve opens
up between the two large lines.  One line comes from the air filter, before
the throttle, and the other goes to the manifold, after the throttle.  When
the car is at high RPMs (over 2k? or more?) and the throttle closes, there
is enough vaccuum to open up the valve.  This acts as a bypass of the
throttle plate, and slows down the deceleration of the engine.
	There is a screw on one end of the valve which changes either where
in the RPM range it works, or how wide it opens, or maybe both.  Not sure,
I have never monkeyed around with mine.  I think the screw is actually the
inlet for the small vacc line.
	To test it--pull the hose from it off the air cleaner.  Rev up the
car to 3500 RPM.  Close the throttle.  If air gets sucked into the discon-
nected hose, it's working.  Well, it is if no air goes into that hose at all
other times...
