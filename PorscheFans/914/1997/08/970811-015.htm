My mechanic has finally had an opportunity to dig into my engine, and
after fixing several vacuum leaks, he noticed that my throttle body was
crap.  I hadn't thought so, but I didn't know what aspects made a
throttle body good.  He said that not only had the idle adjustment screw
punctured the throttle body's wall, but the ridges that stop the plate
were gone, and that the throttle would actually re-open.  I can't verify
any of this, but I don't think he's lying.  He said that he had an extra
throttle body lying around, and that after putting it on, they can't
keep the car from running lean.  This doesn't surprise me, since it
looks like the PO had adjusted the fuel mixture with the MPS, and now
that all of the leaks are fixed and there's a good throttle body on
there, it needs to be re-adjusted.  I asked him how much he wanted for
the used throttle body, and he said he would have to check and see what
they were going for first.  So, can anyone answer this for me so I can
be prepared?  Evidently, it's just a good-condition used throttle body.
Does anyone have a good-condition used throttle body for sale?  If his
price is high, maybe I can trade for another.

Thanks again,
