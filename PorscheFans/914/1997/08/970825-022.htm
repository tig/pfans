Yup. But flow is only as good as the worst part of the system. Sure,
slapping a pair of 48 IDFs on a 914 will flow like mad if it had an
engine capable of sucking in that much air. But a stock 914 head simply
can't do that. I'm fairly sure that some fancy head work and flow bench
time could improve power far more than purchasing a set of big ol'
downdrafts. Why don't I do that myself? Simple, the rules don't allow
it.

First off, the 320i has almost a full point higher compression than the
914. And I'm fairly certain that the cam profile on the 320 is more
agressive than the stock 914 cam, even the '73 cam. But I'd like to see
Dyno numbers on your 320i to really confirm any power increases. I
myself have seen or done mods that I "felt" to be a power gain only to
discover the opposite. Seat of the pants isn't always reliable.

Well for one, it's 30 years old and hasn't been used in production for
probably over 20 years. But as for documentation? I'd say that we, the
net-collective, probably have the most thorough set of documentation on
the trails and tribulations of Bosch's first EFI. As for NLA parts?
What's NLA besides that darn smog pump pulley? As for the ECU? Can you
get a schematic from Bosch on any of their FI brains? I think that's
more of a proprietary thing rather than 30 year old thing. But I belive
one of us has sent off a brain for break down to the company in Montana.
Did any one do this yet?
