I've been watching this debate the last few days and have  noticed how   
this subject always stirs up discussion.  Coming from experience with   
both: i.e. I have a 1974 2L with stock fuel injection and a 1973 2L with   
Dual Delorto 40s,  each one has it's own merrits.  My '74 is a concours   
which I drive on the nice days.  It has alot of pep in a street   
environment, but that D jetronic loves to hunt for a stable idle when the   
car comes to a stop.  I have also had my fair share of problems: from a   
leaky injector body, to a faulty pressure sensor.  I also have to adjust   
the potentiometer on the brainbox to pass emssions.

My '73 I have set up as a track car.  The carbs were on the car when I   
bought it so I figured I'll give it a try.  The engine was re-ringed and   
I even passed Washington State emissions (with better results than the   
FI).  For the guy who wants to know about which idle jets to use (60 mil:   
to pass emissions, 70: for the street, and 75 for the track) for the   
Delorto 40s.  This has been the only time I have had to make adjustments.   
It is true that during warm up the carbs are sluggish.  I remember my old   
1970 Buick GS 455 with 4 barrel carbs, I used to start it up in the   
winter and then go back in the house to finish getting ready for school.   
 I think we've gotten very accustomed  to the quick start up of modern   
day FI systems. Back to the 914:  it doesn't take more that a few minutes   
for the engine to warm up than FI, but then it runs fine.  I have noticed   
that the low end torque (thus acceleration) is not as good as the FI, but   
above 4500 rpm (which is where I need it for the track) it is very   
strong.

A few side side notes:
1.The pistons in the '73 track car are a lower compression version than   
stock (not by my choice).
2. When we had time trials last month my friend had a 1:58 in his '74 2L   
with Euro pistons and I had 2:00.
3. My only complaint with the carbs comes when they do the morning tech   
inspection at the drivers education event, and they ask me to pump the   
throttle (after the car is warmed up) to check for throttle return.
4. Last winter I drove the '73 in the cold weather with no adjustments   
and no problems.
5. I do get better gas milage with the FI (20 vs 15 mpg).

Ironcally I just got another project car that I'm restoring for my wife;   
a '75 2L, and guess what, it has dual Webers.  The engine sounded smooth,   
has reasonable compression but it needs new rings. As someone else said   
everyone has their own biases. Those who are new to the topic must look   
at their own needs and determine which is their best route to take.
