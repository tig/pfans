You will see some handling differences. Specifically, you'll see the
turn you just came out of as you start spinning around. Adding roll
stiffness to the rear without compensating at the front will yeild a
fair bit of transitional oversteer.

Do yourself, and your car, a favor and get a at least a factory front
sway bar to go with the rear bar. Or save a little more money and just
get the front bar. Get it installed properlly by someone who knows what
a 914 is. There are aftermarket swaybars for the 914 that go under the
chassis instead of through it, and they will be cheaper. I don't know
the name of the manufacturer though.

Good luck, and have fun!
