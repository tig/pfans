Rick is right to complain about "cookie-happy" web sites.

Cookie:  A small chunk of data left on your computer by a 
         web site that you have visited.

Cookies allow browser to know all about you; for instance, 
Automotion *could* find out that you just came from the GPR
web site (or vice-versa), and adjust prices accordingly.

I too reject 99.9% of all cookies received.  And avoid web
sites that send too many.  (The worst offender I've found to
date is the California State Assembly web site.  Draw your
own conclusions!)

Gary.
