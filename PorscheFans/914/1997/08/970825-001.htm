[This message is for those of you who have been following the various
threads about my car.  If you haven't, just skip it.]  When I picked my
car up from the mechanic, the first thing that I noticed was that it was
still smoking.  It was also stumbling pretty bad at idle.  I drove it
out of the parking lot and onto the road, bucking all the way.  When I
hit a small straight, I stepped on the gas and whoa!  The car has never
had this much punch before!  It's a whole new animal under full
throttle.  Since the rings are new, I didn't take it past 4,000 RPM, but
boy does it get up there quick.  It feels like it's got at least an
additional 30 ft/lbs of torque (but it's probably just my imagination).
For those of you that remember, I decided to run without a head gasket.
In combination with a previous fly-cut on my heads, and the Euro 2.0
pistons, this resulted in a compression ratio of about 8.3:1.  Man, does
that make a difference.  I just hope I haven't sacrificed too much
engine life.  After driving it home 30 miles, I started it up the next
morning and received my second pleasant surprise... no more smoke!  It
looks like those rings just needed to be broken in.  Now, I've got to
tackle the big FI mystery that the mechanic couldn't figure out...
