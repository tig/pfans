This weekend, my brother and I spend about 12 hrs changing the rings in
my 914, but were sorely disappointed when the car continued to blow
smoke.  Now we've decided that the only thing left to do, is to bring it
to a mechanic, and ask them to figure this mess out.

The car didn't used to smoke.  It in fact had a rebuilt engine when I
bought it 2 months ago.  However it did have a problem with the
carburator, that when parked with the nose up a hill, allowed gas to get
past and flooded the engine compartment.  The first time this happened,
I didn't know what was going on, and when the car wouldn't start, I
tried to bump it.  Unfortunatly, the car hydro locked and something gave
way.  

Well...now I know it's not the rings....what could be next?  The car
runs fine.  It never smokes on idle.  When driving, it doesn't start to
smoke until about 5 min, and then, it only becomes noticeable when a
substantial load is placed on the engine (like going up hill)

I must say that if I had money to spare, I'd roll this car down to the
junk yard, and start over...but if that were true, I would never have
atempted to do the rings.  What a miserable job!  I sliced my finger
wide open in the process, taking off the old rings.  And what a pain
getting those mother's on...

The only other thing I've heard could be causing this problem are the
valves, or valve guides.  That's what I'm going to ask the mechanic to
look at tomorrow.  

I'd be gratefull for any other insights.  

Thanks
