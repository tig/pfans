Hello,

I am currently looking into lack of ride height on my 914.  This is a new
suspension setup for me, but once installed in order to get the front
leveled with the back I have maybe 3" of ride height from the lowest
point of the chassis.  I don't think this is a good thing, especially
here in Ohio where we bread pot holes as a major agricultural export.

Anyway, I am looking for some ride height info.  Please include the
points from which you measured.  I did the initial from the bottom lip at
the top of the fender opening, from the floor up, thru the center point
of the wheel, using the cap as a reference point.  I got 22.75" on the
fronts, and did not even want to measure the rears.  Looking to set ride
height then continue with the corner balancing, and then the rest of the
alignment.

Take care,
Stephen Jacobs
