Hello:

This is my first visit to your site.  I wanted to let you all know that we
make a conversion kit for the rear control arms for 914's.   It replaces
the factory shaft and bushings with endcaps that contain sphirical
bearings.  The inner cap has its bore off center  - and can be turned - to
allow greater range of toe and camber settings.  It provides a stiffness
and adjustment range that the stock design cannot .  The kit is made of the
finest materials (aluminum and chromoly) and is precision CNC machined.

David Furgeson used the prototypes on his GT-3 car at the PCA Club Race at
Portland a   week ago and was thrilled with its performance and adjustment
enhancements.

If you are interested in such a system, please let me know.  We also have a
new catalog available primarily for Porsche cars.

Thank you,
