I want to thank everyone who replied to my earlier message.  I cannot
tell you how much I appreciate these lists, and everyone on them.  I'm
glad to say that the "Exorbitant Mechanic" issue has been resolved.  As
I stood in the waiting area waiting to drive my 914 home for the first
time in nearly a year, my eyes were glued to the ever-increasing value
displayed on the mechanic's calculator.  $400... $500... $600... $700!
My palms were leaving puddles of sweat in my pockets, and I know my face
was turning white.  At this point I realized there was only one person
that could be blamed for this situation... Me.  I never bothered to ask
how much time was being put into my car, nor did I ask whether there was
a different price for diagnostics vs. repair.  The walls of the shop
were plastered with various awards and certificates of recognition from
many race tracks, as well as organizations such as PCA and SCCA.  As the
mechanic approached with the final bill, I had resolved myself to simply
paying it and living on Top Ramen and water for the next few months.  He
then said, "Since we didn't get it completely fixed, I'm going to half
the hours with you."  Then bill came out just under $400, which suited
me just fine.  Many of you sent me messages recommending that I go in
there and only agree to pay for the repair hours.  Several of you sent
me messages pointing out what I realized while standing there in the
shop.  Many of the mechanics that I've gone to in the past make
half-assed attempts to repair the problems, and when they get too
frustrated with the 20 year old FI, recommend I switch to carbs.  This
mechanic suggested none of the above, and continued to find and fix
problems that I couldn't have even known about.  This is a rarity as far
as I'm concerned, and while it is more expensive, I feel the result is
well worth it.  Now, I need to try and figure out what is still wrong
with the car, so I'm going to post that in a new message... this one is
long enough!

Thanks again!
