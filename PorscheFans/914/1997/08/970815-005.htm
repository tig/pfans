My very limited understanding is that the 73 2.0s with the 'appearance
group' included Fuchs alloys, swaybars, center console with gauges, fog
lights, dual horns, and ???  But any cars were available with any
combination of accessories.  My 74 came with 5 Fuchs, AC (dealer
installed of course), NO console, NO swaybars, NO fog lights and a
single horn.

Adding a swaybar is pretty easy (especially if the car already has the
holes drilled).  I added a stock 16mm front bar to mine a few months
back.  I bought the Weltmiester mounting kit and new bushings and bolted
everything together - no problem.  Talk about a MAJOR difference in
handling!  A stock (front) swaybar can be obtained for $50-$100 so its
not a major expenditure.  The rear swaybar is not really recommended for
autocrossing because it tends to cause the inside tire to lift.  So
unless you've got a limited slip differential (unlikely), your inside
tire will break traction.

The underdash blower is great for circulating air (even works good for
circulating hot air from the heater during the Winter).  I'm still
planning to hook up the compressor one of these days, but haven't quite
gotten around to it yet.  Its amazing how many projects I've got pending
for this car!

Hey, if it comes with two 2.0 engines, one running and the other
brand-new-fresh and if the body is solid and straight and everything
looks nice, $4k is a very good price.

Did you verify that both engines have 2.0 heads?  You can tell just by
looking at the intake runners.  If they bolt to the heads with 4 bolts,
they're either VW Bus heads or 1.7/1.8 heads cut to fit the 2.0
cylinders, but if they attach with 3 bolts, they're true 914 2.0 heads.

Good luck on your decision.
