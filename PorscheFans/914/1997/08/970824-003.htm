My 2 cents:

Many people don't play their systems at high volume levels.  And because
your amp is a 4 channel unit loaded to 4 ohms bridged plus 4 ohms stereo,
it's not under a lot of thermal stress. 

The thing to find out is whether or not your amp is getting really hot. 
Just play the system for, say 1 hr or more at a high volume level, trunk
closed, and then open the trunk, and put your hand on the amp.  If the amp
feels _really_ hot, as in hot enough to fry an egg, then you need to change
something.  Otherwise, it's fine. 

The amps do get hot when played at high levels for an extended period of
time.  Amps are ok up to about 160-170 deg or so, as long as the protection
circuitry doesn't shut it down.  Of course, the cooler you keep it, the
longer it will last.

IMHO, IF it gets hot, THEN install a small (2-2.5") 12v fan to blow air
across the amp's heat sinks.  Fan noise is definately not a problem since
your amp is in the trunk.  Just hook up the fan (max 400mA draw) to the
remote turn-on lead.

FYI, a lot of amplifiers are installed "upside down" to the underside of
the rear deck in a sedan, for instance.  They just have better air
circulation than your particular install has.

<<< The Pioneer Premier GM-X404 4 channel amp is mounted upsidedown,
underneath the spare tire panel in the front trunk. This way you don't
lose any room or even notice it until you pick up the panel (it fits
nicely into the space vacated by the spare tire rim). >>>

> That is a BAAAAD idea. Heat travels upwards, which means you'll cook that
> amp. Never, never mount an amp like that.

<<<< Good point! I listened to the advice of my dealer/installer who said
that due to the layout of the circuit board, it didn't matter, but I
didn't think about the heat issue.  FWIW, it has worked flawlessly for
over 2 months, but the location may very well shorten it's life. It'll
be easy to flip it over and mount it to a board within the wheel well. >>>>
