>The Ten Commandments for the 914 Collector
>I.	Thou shalt not store thy cars out-of-doors except for thy wife's
>modern Murican iron.
>II.	Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's car, nor his garage, nor his
>battery charger.
>III.	Thou shalt not love thy cars more than thy wife and children; as
>much, but not more.
>IV.	Thou shalt not write thy long winded E-Mails on company time,
>lest thy employer make it impossible to continue thy car payments.
>V.	Thou shalt not despise thy neighbor's 911, nor his Boxster, nor even
>his 930.
>VI.	Thou shalt not allow thy daughters nor thy sons to get married
>during the holy days of Porsche Parade.
>VII.	Thou shalt not deceive thy wife into thinking that thee is
>taking her for a romantic Sunday drive when, indeed, thou art going out
>to look at another car.
>VIII.	Thou shalt not tell thy spouse the entire cost of thy latest
>restoration, at least not all at the same time.
>IX.	Thou shalt not promise thy wife a new addition to the house and
>then use it to restore cars; thou shalt not store cars in the attic.
>X.	Thou shalt not buy thy wife a floor jack for Christmas.
