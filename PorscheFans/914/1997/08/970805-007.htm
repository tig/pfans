Mike:

Thanks for "sharing" :-)

If the hoses are correct, it could be a stuck Auxiliary Air regulator,
the high idle is a classic symptom, and one I am very familiar with.
Being cheap, I have nursed mine along with periodic application of chain
lube and Mobil One to free the shaft. It usually works for a year on one
application. to test, just plug the intake side of the regulator with
your thumb. If the idle drops to the "good zone," you've got it.
