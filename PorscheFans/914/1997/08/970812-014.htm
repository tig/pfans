Yesterday, my mechanic thought he had everything figured out, but now it
doesn't look so good.  He's not too sure what's causing the problem, so
he's set my car to the side to think about it.  I'm hoping to be able to
offer him some suggestions, so if you've experienced the following
behavior and fixed it, I'd love to hear about it.  It's been nearly a
year since I last drove my 914, and I'm getting a little anxious.

Once he gets the car tuned properly (correct idle RPM, correct CO, and
low HC), he'll take it for a spin.  He said that the cars runs
beautifully while making power, but once he brings it back in, the idle,
CO, and HC will be all screwed up.  Sometimes it's too lean, and
sometimes it's too rich.  He's adjusted the timing, fixed all vacuum
leaks, and soldered up all visible loose wires.  Any ideas as to what
could cause this intermittent behavior?

Thanks again!
