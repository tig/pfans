Us slow-moving Ohioans have convinced our state government to *LOWER* smog
compliance and to eliminate the dreaded "E-CHECK" dyno test in favor of a
much simpler, lower cost, lower requirement tailpipe exam.

Please remember that while less than 5 percent of all pollution is caused by
auto emissions, the vast majority is created by industry.  Only, it's easier
to tax general public.  There's no way your state governments want to
penalize the industries that generate the highest tax revenue!

Your government is supposed to be representative of the people, so make it so.

Sorry for my ranting and raving.

PS - Please remind your elected officials that there are far greater amounts
of pollution generated by 2-cycle lawn mowers and chainsaws than
automobiles.  But oops -- how would they license and tax them?
