The problem with these listed solutions is that they tend not to
work over the long term.   The problem tends to be a general
deterioration of the entire solonoid circuit, including connectors,
switches, wires, and relays.    Unfortunatly the starters and
solonoids get blamed, changed, and rechanged, all to recur
again in 914s, 911s, and 928s, where the circuit pathways are
long and the voltage drops are high.   

I happen to be a fan of the remote solonoid because it works.
The next most effective solution, though complex and expensive,
is a complete replacement of the wiring in the solonoid circuit.
While that may sound straightforward it generally means a complete
wiring harness replacement/rebuild, as well as a replacement of
the starter switch and all the associated connectors.   Do it well
and it works.   Same can be said for the relay/remote solonoid.
Take your pick.
