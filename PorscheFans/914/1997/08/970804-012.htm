Sorry for the late post...have been away.

I used to tow a 911 to tracks all over the Northeast on a dolly.  It
worked fine, never caused any problems at all; and I don't feel the
tranny experienced any significant additional wear based on towing in
neutral.

The only potential problem would be an "incident" affecting both ends of
the car...ie. it won't roll backwards or forward.
