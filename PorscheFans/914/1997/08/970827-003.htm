You're talking about the vacuum line from the PCV valve? Yeah, that is
connected to high vacuum in the fuel injection setup. All the other cars
I've seen they connect it to the air filter housing. What I've learned is
that the hose for the PCV has to be a large size to prevent backpressure
inside the engine. It has to be very free breathing, in other words. Make
sure you have no restrictions in the tubing to the PCV valve. If you do, it
will seriously effect the engine's performance (ie, it won't rev as freely).
