I missed the initial message so may be off base here.  I don't know what
performance level you were talking about.

The crank counterweights aren't just to make the crank stiffer but to make
it balanced when rotating at high rpm.  For type 1 the stock crank was ok
to about 4k, for normal street driving.  At higher rpms it would flex more.

I think the crank flex Dirk mentioned is more a problem in the type 1
world.  The type 4 cases and bearings are talked about as 'bulletproof', a
type 4 to type 1 conversion is suppose to be great.  It isn't done often
because of the much more expensive type 4 parts.  Gene Berg, a big name in
type 1 equipment had custom forged type 1 counterweighted cranks available
with the larger type 4 main bearing.  His tech notes also mention shuffle
pinning (speaking about type 1 cases) as a bandaid.  With a properly
counterweighted crank, the whole system balanced, he believed shuffle
pinning was unnecessary since the crank flex was gone.  I think this was
even in their racing motors.

Another point he had was that counterweighted cranks were good, not full
circle counterweighted cranks.  I'd recommend anyone interested in the
mechanics of VW engines get the Berg catalog (look for ads in Hot VW
magazine), has lots of tech info in it.  Oriented to type 1 but still good
info.

Why not do both (ie, shuffle pin and raceware studs)? I assume you're using
a counterweighted crank. I read somewhere that in these vw motors the
center main journal suffers from a precessing motion from the crank shaft
flexing under load. I think the extra metal in a counterweighted crank
makes the crank stiffer and thus reduces this problem. So, do all three:
counterwieghted crank, raceware bolts (and studs), and shuffle pins.
Another thing is to get better rods, which several machine shops on the
left coast manufacture.
