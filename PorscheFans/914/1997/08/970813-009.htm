Dirk,

A good hardware store in town may carry them, or an A?C heating and
cooling, these are all local.

But if you can go get a recycler or other auto dimanteling trade rag,
there are places that sell them in assortment bags.  Like 200 plugs for
$20.00, every size conseviedable.  I think they are from 3" on down to
1/4", that should plug most holes on a 914.  They also sell other cool
tools, and tags for the marking and labeling parts.

Also Eastwood sells a set if you get really desparate, but you also get
Eastwood prices.  Not that they are bad, but you can find them for less.

Take care,
Stephen Jacobs
