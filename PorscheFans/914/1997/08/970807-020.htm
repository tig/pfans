JJ, 

The shoe polish idea is a good one, but it only lasts for a short time.
There is a similar, but much better alternative. I found a dye in
Germany, made to restore black plastic bumpers. It is thin, like liquid
shoe polish, so you don't lose any surface detail, and water soluble
until it dries, so you can thin it if you don't want a shine. It comes
in a shoe-polish-type bottle with sponge applicator, but unlike wax it
lasts for years.  

Griot's Garage sells a product that looks like the same thing. It's not
their Vinyl and Rubber care product, but an actual black dye. (Of
course, I haven't got the catalog with me now.) But I can look it up
later If you can't find it. It might also be available from auto parts
stores, but it is definately not a wax.

I use a pretty damp towel to rub it in and cut it down a little and 
have had great results restoring the bumpers ('75), side vinyl, top and
about a hundred other things, since the 914 seems to be about 50% vinyl
by weight.

I've tried them all, this is the best.
