All- I'm new to this list, so bear with me please. I'll probably ask a few
(a lot) dumb questions at first, but I have every intention of becoming
good at this.

I just bought a '72 914-4 cheap. I've already been told that was my first
dumb thing. :-) It's too late now, so I'm going to make the best of it.
Worst case, I'll practice on this one, so I'll know what I'm doing when I
step up to a '74 2.0.

1. I need a manual bad! Where can I get the best?

2. My first tinkering was to figure out why the passenger door won't open
from the outside. After taking apart the good door, I figured out I need a
little round white plastic thing with two flat pivoting legs.

3. That's the good news. The bad news is I need a floor pan? I didn't know
about this major thing to look for until after I bought the car. With two
people in the car, it's very hard to open the doors to get out. Forget
about rolling the windows all the way up. Also, another clue I missed- the
latch on the rear of the top doesn't even meet the hook by at least 1/2
inch. Duh! I have heard this repair is very expensive, but since I believe
all 914's should be saved, I'll bite the bullet and get it fixed. With this
much flex, IS THE CAR SAFE TO DRIVE?

4. Car almost dies when hot. I've been reading about this in the archives,
so I'll try a few things, but first I need #1 (manual) taken care of so I
can figure out what some of this stuff that needs checking looks like.
Before I found the Renegade forum, I removed the air filter to look for an
idle adjustment, and spilled oil all over the left side of the engine.
Stupid, stupid, stupid! I'm learning.

5. Two large corrugated hoses that go from some central round thing on the
engine (looks like a dual hair drier) to each of the sides of the engine
compartment (exhaust, ??) are gone or almost gone. How important are these?

6. A rubber hose with red wrapping has been chopped off the right rear area
of the engine. Another exhaust thing? Important?

7. Gas guage stuck on 1/2 (oops, 2/4), but goes to Empty when the car is
turned off, leading me to believe it's probably not the actual guage.
Float? Fixable?

8. I need a fuse box diagram. Some fuses missing. Accidentally knocked
about 5 of them out last night (no cover), and it took me 15 minutes to get
all the head and taillights working again. Sheesh!

Engine runs/sounds very good, and tranny shifts all right. Feels fantastic
running down the interstate in 5th gear at 70mph, 3,000 rpm. Odometer has
been unhooked at 12,800, so it's got at least 112,800 miles on it. BTW, how
do I hook up the odometer? At least then I might be able to figure out when
to put more gas in the car until I get the damn guage fixed. :-) That's
assuming 25 mpg with 16 gal tank, I hope? See, I know a few things.

I know I've run on a little, and I hope I haven't bored some of you
veterans, but I'm excited to get to work on some of the little minor
things, except, of course, the floor pan thing. I would hope, with a manual
and a year or two of time, that I might be able to return the favor to
other newcomers who love this car as much as I do.

Thanks.

Steve
