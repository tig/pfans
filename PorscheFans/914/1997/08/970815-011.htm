>>What were the differences between the '73 2.0s and the '74s?

	The real differences between the 73 and 74 cars are pretty trivial.
Some (subtle) differences in FI componentry, squarish rubber overriders
("tits") on the rear bumper (74 had front and rear, 73 only front), and
the 74 has a single turn signal indicator light in the tach, while the
73 has separate right/left arrows.
	The real diffs, as has been noted, were that the optional equipment
(alloys, swaybars, console, chrome bumpers, leather-covered steering wheel,
leather shift boot, etc.) were standard on the 73s unless the car was
special-ordered.

>If it had bars, it would be nice to have the original rear bar...

	If the car has the brackets on the underside of the rear trunk
floor and the ball-joint bolts on the rear end of the trailing arms,
then mounting the original rear bar is trivial.  You can get them for
well under $100 at swap meets.

	It still sounds like a good deal--at least, if the front trunk
floor has been reinforced to make up for the big HOLE put in it for the
A/C.  Actually, it sounds like a very good deal.  Almost suspiciously
good.
	A 914 in very good shape (it sounds like) with a spare fresh
motor for $4K?  Hmmm...  That and the 73/74 confusion make me wonder a
bit about it.  Figure a motor would cost you about $3K on an exchange
basis, more to get it outright.
	Of course, he could be doing a "motor miester special" on the
rebuild, and cutting corners big-time, which would cost you less than the
$3K to buy on your own.

	Records are a good thing.  You can see how the car was treated.
If the oil changes and valve adjusts are regular, that's a good thing.  If
there are a few major components that have been replaced, that's expected.
They can give you a good feel for if the car has been good to its owner or
not.
	You can (and should!!) check the date vs. the mileage on the re-
ciepts just to make sure that there's no funny business going on with the
odometer or anything like that.
	And yes, have the car inspected by a professional Porsche mechanic,
preferably one who knows 914s and has no involvement with the sale.

	Just remember, different regions of the PCA frequently follow dif-
ferent rule sets.  Zone 8, last I checked, used a different list of "points"
than were listed above.  My own zone, Zone 7, uses a completely different
system, with no "points".
	Check your local rulebooks before you start making major mods to your
car.

>In SCCA stock class I am limited to change the following
>Shocks ( stock type)

>Original width wheel with +/-.25" backspacing.

	Don't forget "cat-back exhaust".  Which means any muffler for us
914ers.

	Oops!  This could easily get into a rules discussion.  I don't think
we want to go there, do we?

	Anyway, on the car, I'd say to keep your eyes open, but seriously
consider it.  It could be a great deal, or a real nightmare.
