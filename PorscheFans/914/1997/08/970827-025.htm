Just quessing since I'm still learning the systems myself but isn't this
normal?  The injectors are fired in pairs, which pair is controlled by the
trigger points in the distributor.  If you weren't turning over the engine,
the dist wasn't rotating, so only the one pair would fire?

Here's something I ran into while trying to troubleshoot a starting problem
on the '73 D-jet... Turned on the ignition switch but did not crank the
starter. Rotated the throttle to activate the throttle switch. Only 2
injectors firing. Swapped injectors, checked wiring continuity, checked
fuel pump, checked fuel lines, swapped ecu boxes. Same thing. No mention of
only 2 injectors firing during starting in any literature I can find. I
guess they are supposed to work that way (prevent flooding, maybe?), but I
wasted days chasing down what I supposed to be a problem.
