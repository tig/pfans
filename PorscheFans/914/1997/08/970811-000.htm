I recently dropped my engine to replace rings.  Things went resonably
well, but one thing I forgot to put back is a peice of engine sheet
metal.  There are 4 curved pieces that go on the bottom on each corner. 
They fit snug up against the front cylinder on the drivers side.  The
Haynes manual refers to them as engine ducting.  How important is this
particular piece?

Another problem is that I snapped the thin cable that goes from the
little "accordian" type thermostat, goes up through the engine shroud,
and operates those flaps.  Again, the Haynes manual seems to say that if
the cable were severed, the spring would force the flaps in the full
open position.  Until I get a replacement, would it be ok to drive it in
full open?  

BTW - thanks to all to advised me on my cars smoking condition right
after I changed the rings.  The rings seem to have set now, and the
smoke has cleared up.

Thanks
