	Hmmm, sounds close.  The 914 has a rather tall 5th gear--good for
highway mileage.

	Quite possibly related.  I'm still not entirely clear on what the
symptoms of the first problem were, but the second sounds exactly like a
ground problem.  Sounds an awful lot like someone has put a single-filament
light bulb into a socket that was designed for a dual-filament.  Or vice
versa.
	Very very weird things happen when you put the wrong type of bulb
in the turn signals/etc.  BT,DT.  If one of your front turn signals is mis-
behaving, check to see if the bulb is the right type.  Actually, since
both signals have some wires in common, it's a good idea to check both.
