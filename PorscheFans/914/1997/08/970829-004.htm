Dave, here's the procedure for replacing the glass in your door mirror:
1.  unhook your clutch cable (I know, I know, but follow along)
2.  get 2 friends to help you push the car onto a trailer (Why?  Because
the clutch cable is unhooked, dummy!)
3.  tow the trailer to a spot where the back is facing down a hill
4.  ask you wife to get in and see if there are any brakes (at which
point she will push the clutch pedal to the floor and tell you, "no the
brake pedal goes straight to the floor")
5.  tell her she'll have to modulate the (rusted of course) hand brake
to stop the car
6.  push the car slowly off the trailer down the hill
7.  use your body to try to slow the car's accelleration
8.  make sure (and this is the important part) that as the car slips out
of your frantically clutching hands that the mirror is lined up just
right to cause serious bruises as it slams into your body
9.  now that the mirror glass is broken, it is easy to remove the little
plastic trim piece that holds it in place (in fact, pieces of it may
still be lodged in your side from step 8 - check carefully)

If you still have all the pieces of the broken glass, take it to a glass
shop and ask them to cut one just like it (without the cracks of course)
- should cost $5-10.  Clean everything up good and grease the part where
it is supposed to pivot.  Mine had some kind of old rag stuffed in
behind the glass - maybe to keep it from vibrating, maybe cause Hans or
Fritz left it in there by accident when they assembled it 24 years ago.
I don't know if this is stock or not.

The plastic trim should flex enough along the top and bottom (the long
runs) to get it out without having to bend any of the chrome.

Good luck (oh and BTW,  you can improvise on the first 9 steps - I'm
sure you're as capable as me of designing a similar procedure)

what kind of battle I'd start with that one!)
