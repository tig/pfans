  I am going to offer a suggestion, but the theory is poor in that if
the suggested cause is correct, there should be oil on both sides of
the engine, unless there are strange air circulation patterns that
are at work here.

  You didn't mention whether or not there was oil on the cylinders
themselves, which would be a necessity if my theory is to have any
chance of being correct.

   As Neils Bohr once remarked:  "We are all agreed that your theory
is crazy; the question is, is it crazy enough to have a chance of
being correct?  My opinion is that it is not crazy enough."

  Anyway, here it is:  A leaking front oil seal is allowing oil to be
picked up by the fan, atomized, and ducted around by the sheetmetal,
where it is leaking down through  the joint between the sheetmetal
and the head in the vicinity of the intake runners, and spattering
from there.   This would be an RPM related thing, because of the fact
that at low RPM's any leak would just drip down the front of the
engine, instead of being picked up by the relatively weaker fan air
stream.

  However, as I pointed out, this theory cannot explain why the oil
is confined to the right side of the engine.

  One other thought:  How do you allow for breathing of the heads on
your engine?  Is it possible that the breather hose on the right side
head (if so equipped) has a crack in it, or has come adrift?

					Good Luck,
                                                            Jim T.
