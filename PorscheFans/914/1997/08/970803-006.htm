Hi all,

	I thought I'd toss this out there for a possible diagnosis. This
happened at the trials event yesterday. I pulled off after my qualifying
run (didn't do as well as I'd hoped), and popped the engine lid to help
it cool off and discoverd oil splattered along the right side of the
engine bay, there was oil puddling under the intake runner at the head,
and dripping onto the valve cover and exhaust pipes. To say the least, I
was dissheartened. Last trials points event of the season and I havn't
gotten in even one timed lap yet. So what did I do? I had myself moved
into the very last (slowest) group, and drove one lap, very slowly, and
got my one timed lap in. Why did I do that? I needed this event to
qualify for the season trophy, and I was not about to let this keep me
from the trophy. I just kept it below 3k rpm and puttered around the 2.7
mile course waving to the corner workers. So what, I qualified for the
trophy didn't I? Afterwards, I puttered home and parked it. Not alot of
extra oil so I can only assume this was a high rpm related thing, either
that or a high temperature thing.

Anyway, anyone seen this before? I've blown (or inhaled) the valve cover
gasket before, and the below-the-sheetmetal symptoms are similar, but
I've never seen oil make its way into the engine bay like that before if
it came from the VC gasket. I figure it's not a cracked head, if it was,
I'd expect ALOT of noise and significant power loss. The oil was
splattered on the battery, firewall, and engine tin around the right
side head. I'm about to outside and start digging around for a cause,
but any suggestions or advice would be appreciated.
