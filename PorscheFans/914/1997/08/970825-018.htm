	Hi, all.  I've been following the discussion of "why not carbs?"
remotely on my vacation, and building up a bit of steam on the subject,
so this reply might be just a little more heated than it should be.  I
also think that my anti-carb bias is pretty well-known.

	Now:
	Josh2, I think you're mis-stating the power differences.  I mean,
if I told you that I'd fund *ANY* fuel system for you, what would you
pick?  A well set-up pair of Webers, or do I hear the word HALTECH coming
from your lips?  Hmmmm?  So which one do you think makes more power now?
	There is the *teeeeeeny* little point that the Haltech system is
almost nothing like the stock D-jet.  Details, details.  I'm talking FI
in general for a moment.
	I think that Mike's 0-60 times, while not completely scientific,
do tend to indicate that the stock FI makes a bit more power on an
otherwise-stock 914 motor than carbs do.

	Dirk, I don't think the 356 has a whole lot to do with our car.
The late 356/912 has a motor that is rather different in design from the
VW Type IV used on our cars.  For one thing, the cylinder heads and cams
used flowed a *whole* hell of a lot better than ours.  The heads were also
designed to cope with pretty high compression, while ours are not.
	Furthermore, the engine, ignition, and carbs were designed TOGETHER.
Porsche didn't take a motor that they already had which was designed for
something else, drag a pair of carbs out of the parts bin, and say "with a
half-hour of dyno time, we've got our fuel system!"  There is a very VERY
large difference between designing a complete motor with intake, ignition,
exhaust, etc., and taking a motor designed for some other fuel system and
slapping a pair of Webers on it.  (Or Dells or whatever.)  As much as the
Weber folks will tell you, "Yeah, sure--we designed this carb for any 1971
cc motor, motors are motors!" that is not the case.  The exhaust, the heads,
and the ignition have a lot to do with the dynamics of trying to make power.
Everything interacts with everything else, and not always in a simple
fashion.
	I will suggest, Dirk, that you have an irrational bias against the
FI.  Probably as large as my own irrational bias against carbs.  You got
upset at the unavailability of some 2.0 FI parts, and that may be clouding
your judgement.  (My own story involves one of the more complicated carbs
on the road today, from a Honda Accord...  But that's another story.)

	The point about the European 1.8s is valid.  They did indeed come
with carbs--I think it was Solex 32 PSDITs.  They made more power than the
US-spec 1.8s that had the L-jet FI.  They also had OVER a full point more
compression than the US car--and the HP difference (10 HP, I think) is not
as much as I would expect (*major* IMHO!!!) from another 1.3 CR...

	Finally, it is worthwhile to remember that the "shorter-lasting,
less-powerful, oily-engine..." refers to specific installations of after-
market carbs on an otherwise-stock 914.  If you've got a 2.4L four-banger
with a rumpa-rumpa cam, heads flowed to Kingdom Come, a nifty tuned extrac-
tor exhaust system, and enough cooling to handle it all; the stock FI is
not a very good option.  Carbs are a reasonable option, and are fairly
cheap and simple.  The custom FI is better, though...

	So, have I done enough raving yet?  Let me know if I missed out on
offending someone, so I can get you too in the next note...   ;^)
