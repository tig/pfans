I have two questions.

1)  I have heard that electronic ignition is the way to go.  So, I went down
to the local auto parts store to see how much they would be.  The manager
quickly told me that electronic ignition is worthless,  saying that there are
no significant improvements.  So I am wondering, If anyone has converted to
electronic igniton, What are the benefits?  Is it worth forking over 100$
bucks for an extra mile per gallon?  Do people buy it just to say they have
"electronic ignition"?

2) I recently noticed that the wire to the throttle valve switch was
disconected.  It had been for a long time, at least a few months and quite
possibely a long as a year(when I bought the car).  I plugged it in and a few
problems arose.  One is that the engine seems to misfire when I let off the
gas and coast in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th gears.  It makes a "pop, pa pop, pop pop"
sound from the muffler.  It also seems to hesitate when I start out in first
from a complete stop( after I have been driving a while).  Has anyone else
had problems such as these?  My first guess is obliously a defective throttle
switch, but I have heard that problems that seem to be related to the
throttle switch, can be caused by other fuel injection components.  What
could this be?

Thanks,
