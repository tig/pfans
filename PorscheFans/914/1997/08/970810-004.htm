Hi gang,

The famous "Hot Start Kit" is indeed a Ford solenoid.  This merely
increases the voltage to the "start" terminal of the starter to battery
voltage.  It helps the solenoid kick over when it is hot.  Measure the
voltage from the ignition switch wire (the 1/4" spade terminal on the
starter).  If you get 11v or more when cranking, then this is NOT your
problem.  If you get something like 8-10v then this is quite likely your
problem, and easily fixed with parts from your FLAPS.  This is an easy fix
for many cars, not just our beloved 914s.  

   To build your own hot start kit:
You take a fat (14g or 12g) wire from the big ring terminal of the starter
and put it to one of the big ring terminals of the Ford solenoid.  Move the
1/4" spade from the starter to the small stud "S" on the solenoid by
crimping on a small ring terminal.  Then take a wire from the other big
stud on the Ford solenoid to the 1/4" spade terminal of the starter.  Bolt
the Ford solenoid to the underside of the trunk floor, as close to the
starter as practical.  Remember that the engine/transmission will move
slightly as you shift gears due to rubber engine mounts.  The solenoids are
availible from any FLAPS.  Just buy 2' of 12g wire and 3 big ring terminals
and a small ring terminal and a 1/4" spade terminal.

cheers, Brian
