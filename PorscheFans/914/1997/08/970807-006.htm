Dion, check for exhaust leaks too.  Typically you will get popping from
an exhaust leak on decelleration and popping from the carbs due to
intake leaks usually is most noticable under steady, light throttle.
Check for leaks around your manifold-to-head gasket by spraying carb
cleaner around the base with the engine running.  (I like to do it
before it gets to hot.)  If your idle changes when you spray in any
area, there is a leak there.  Check for exhaust leaks by listening  for
a loud 'ticking' sound under the car (usually most noticeable right in
front of the rear wheels.  Which ever side seems louder is probably the
side with a leak.

Hope this helps.

P.S.  You might want to put a little locktite - NOT the red stuff - on
your intake manifold nuts to keep them from vibrating loose.
