The only reason Porsche chose to use fuel injection with the US cars was to
meet US emissions laws. That's also why 1969 was the last year for the 912
(with carbureted 356 engine). The 356 engine could not meet smog laws.

All those warnings about changing over to carbs is a bunch of smoke and
mirrors. I don't see all those 356 and 912 owners converting thier dual
carb'ed engines to fuel injection, if they could. I certainly have never
seen anyone lament the fact that there is no "fuel injection conversion"
kit available for the 356 engine have you? If anyone wanted to "extend
engine life", it would be 356 owners with thier expensive and tricky
engines.

Who cares about gas mileage in a 4 cylinder engine anyway? Gas is not that
expensive these days.
