Just remember the extinguisher is there to get you out of the car.  It
will not have enough guts to put out a major fire, optimistically you
have 20 seconds.  Also never open the hood or engine lid on a burning
car, you just add fuel to the fire, the fuel is O2.  If you are going to
try putting out the fire, shoot thru the grill.  But don't open the lid,
ever see the movie back draft, same thing happens when that extra O2
dumps in the compartment.  Not a pretty sight.

But yes that is where I have my extinguisher located.  And yes it is good
to carry one with you.  I don't like fires, except fire flies.  Fire ants
now that is a different story.

Take care,
Stephen Jacobs
