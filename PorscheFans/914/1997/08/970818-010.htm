How to re-spring a trunk:  Don't.  That has been my tactic.  At least until
someone can recommend a decent solution so that the pivots won't break again.
 The rear trunk springs are under a tremendous amount of torsion, and they
are that way
for 99.999% of the time.  In my opinion, the rear pivot points just aren't
designed
well enough to support that amount of shear stress / torsional stress.  Has
anyone 
tried reinforcing the pivots themselves before they are welded on?  If anyone
has 
any suggestions as to how to reinstall these pivot points so that they will
not come off again, please speak up.  Until then, I will leave my rear hood
unsprung.
