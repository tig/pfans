Sam:

I'm not a qualified mechanic, but when I rebuilt my engine, I was told
that it smetimes takes several hundred miles to seat the rings,
especially if the P&Cs are being re-used. Consequently, mine smoked just
like you describe, but it doesn't now. Another cause of smoking,
especially if it is very light, the kind you only see at night in the
headlights of following cars, is over rich fuel mixture.

This is not to say the valve guides are not also to blame, but the rings
may be OK. 

Does anybody really know what's going on here?
