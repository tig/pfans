Brian,

I think the Revolutions are what my Pop ran on my car when it wasn't yet
mine.  I had two days at the Glen with them as a rank beginner (as
opposed to my current rank beginner status a year later <gg>) and they
sure could grip but I've never A/B'd them same day same track.  They're
the brushed alloys with 5 flat spokes, right?  Worth all your lunch
money, I'm sure.

Best,
Thwen
