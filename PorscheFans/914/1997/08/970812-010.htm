Following the thread on "Cookies" that was running over the last couple
of days.  I was at a seminar last month, and listened to a guy explain
what they are, what they are supposedly utilized for, and the potential
sinister applications in the hands of some Hitlerian nutcase (or maybe
worse yet, our own maligned govt.-types, but we don't have those do we?).

Now I'm not very computer literate.  I have some working knowledge.  My
curiosity is this - the thread the other day made it sound like someone
could possibly have an instant cookie alert, whenever one was being
attempted to be applied.  Is this so?  Second curiosity - the fellow I
heard speak alluded to the fact that you can somehow go to some  pull
down menu function and view who has applied cookies thus far, then decide
whether you want to delete them or not.  Is this true, and how do I go
look at these?  FYI, I utilize Netscape for web stuff.

Thanks in advance to whichever computer gurus respond.  I'm sure glad we
have a few on here to help us confuser illiterate types :-)

BTW - if anyone wants an opinion about Juno, post me, and I'll fill your
ear :-(
