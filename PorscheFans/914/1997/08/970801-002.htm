Some ignition modifications are legal in California (others are not).  I 
have started istalling a Crane system: optical trigger for points (XR700, 
PN 700-0231, $80), new coil (PS91 $45), and capacitive discharge 
(multiple spark) ignition with rev limiter (HI-6, $150).  All of these 
are CARB (California Air Resources Board) approved.  The cheapest place 
for these items is probably Performance Automotive Wherehouse (So. Cal. 
mail order), see "Hot Rod" for one of their ads (this is also a cheap 
place to order VDO guages...).

I put the two control boxes in the rear trunk, they fit nicely on the 
sloped part, right under the stored roof.  I will let you know how the 
whole system works when I find some time to finish the installation.

Crane advises that you use spiral core spark plug wire for their coils.  
I am using Accel wires because I think they are the only spiral core 
wires that have really long boots to fit through the sheet metal.

I am doing it for reliability and for, perhaps, more power.  The car 
should be more effecient and cleaner also.  The original ignition is 
beyond obsolete, while the fuel injection can at least pretend to be 
"modern".

Speaking of fuel injection -- does anyone know someone in the bay area 
who is real good with the d-jet?  I've been through mine and I cannot 
find anything wrong, but I think the car could run better.
