	You might get this to work.  The stock system uses head temp as
an indicator of engine temp--in water-cooled versions of D-jet and L-jet
there is no head temp sensor, but there is a coolant temp sensor.  So
this might also be a reasonable way to go.
	The right-hand head of most 914s has a tapped hole to screw in
a thermistor which is Temp Sensor II.  Since it's an NTC thermistor, the
resistance drops as the head warms up.  If that's the type of input the
Haltech needs, then all you have to do is find a sensor with the appro-
priate range.  Otherwise you'll have some more work to do; the oil temp
might be easier.
	I'm not sure that oil temp is that great an indicator of the temp
of the "business end" of the engine--rule of thumb in water-cooled cars
is that the oil takes twice as long to get up to temp as the water does.
Also, the oil temp gauge in my 914is just barely off "cold" by the time
the engine is warmed up.  The gauge can read almost full cold, but Temp
Sensor II is reading very low resistance.
	For an oil temp input into the FI, you'd want something that re-
acts a lot to small temp changes at low temps, then not at all to large
changes at high temps.

	Sounds interesting--let us know how it turns out.
