Hi Folks: For those of you who are planning on attending the Mid West
Renegade Festival I thought I would pass on the following. The family spent
the last weekend before school in Branson this past weekend. Although we
didn't stay at the Rocky Lane Resort, we did go by to check it out. A nice
place on the water with all kinds of water craft available for rent. It is
located about three miles from the Silver Dollar City Theme Park and about
seven (Heavy traffic Miles ) from the "strip" with all of the shows,
restaurants, etc. If you are planning on bringing the kids, they will have a
great time. Branson has added several new access highways to help traffic
flow. These are not on the map so if you need some help with directions let
me know.
