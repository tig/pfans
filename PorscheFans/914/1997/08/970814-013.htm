No respect.  Last weekend I happened to catch a Motor Trend show on TNN and
one of the cars they showed was the Boxster.  Went on about the new low
priced Porsche, mid engine design, then they had to make the crack about
how it was a 'true Porsche'  unlike the 70's 914...yada yada....ugh.

Still I know what you mean.  I want a nice car I can drive and have fun
with.  If it gets to the point where I'm afraid to drive it
because it's worth so much it takes all the fun out of it.

And a wonderful thing that is for those who drive these cars cause we know
better, as opposed to those who want to crate them up and wait till they
turn a profit.
