Dirk,

The last 914 I had was a '71.  It was a worn out puppy when I got it, and
I totally restored it as my project car all through college, where I
earned my undergraduate degree in automotive engineering.  The rebuild
process went from '75 to '79.  At that time I had the same desire as you,
to grommet every opening.  I went to several parts stores in the area (I
lived in Mankato, MN at the time) like Carquest, Napa and other lesser
known ones.  To my surprise I found bundle-packed grommets of every size
imaginable, much like the way they package cotter pins, and washers - you
know - assortment style.

I believe that I have seen companies who cater to everything-plastic
advertising in the _NASA Tech Briefs_ magazine, and I've gotten
rubber/plastic stuff from suppliers to the airplane industry also.

Hope these ideas help you.

TAFN
Jebby  :-]
