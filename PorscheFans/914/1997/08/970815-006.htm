Hi Brett.

From your description, this sounds like a *VERY* good deal at $4000.

(1) It surely appears this guy knows what he is talking about, or at least
is a 914 fan.

(2) If the rust is confined to the battery tray and he will fix it, you're
one up on most 914 owners.

(3) Not all 2.0's can with sway-bars.  My '75 didn't.  Anyway, if you are
going to autocross the car, you want to upgrade from the factory sway-bay to
an adjustable unit like the Weltmeister -- so originals are irrelevant.

(4) The cost of a freshly rebuilt 2.0 is a fair chunk of change.  So, in the
worst case, you can sell the new motor and recoup some of your investment.
My question though is why he is throwing in another engine when it appears
he has other projects he can use it in?
