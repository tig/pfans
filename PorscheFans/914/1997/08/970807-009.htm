If adding resistance to the head temp sensor solved the lean-running and
starting problems, then the head temp sensor is definately a problem.
But it may only be a symptom. If the fuel pressure is too low, then the
engine will run lean and be harder to start as well. And adding
resistance to the head temp sensor will tell the brain that the engine
is colder, and it will richen up the mixture by increasing the injector
pulse lengths.

Just remember that many 914 tachs read high. 850 actual reads 1250 on my
tach for example.

The gauge will certainly tell you if you have vapor lock. It will read
_zero_ fuel pressure. It may also be a defective or dying fuel pump. It
certainly sounds like a fuel delivery problem. BTDT. When my pump was
acting up (dying), and it was most weird, I would see bubbles in the
lines too. But it wasn't vapor lock for me.

There are a few things you can do. 

1] adjust the idle screw, but you already did that.

2] cheap fix: get a very small machine screw and nut and insert it
through the hole in the throttle plate and fix it on there with the nut.
Make sure that nut is tight, if it comes off, the next thing you'll hear
is the sound your engine ingesting a metalic foreign body. Cha-ching!
$$$$

3] tear down the throttle body yourself and either reassemble and align
it, or install bushings on your own. Did it, it requires patience and
subtle adjustments to get the throttle plate properly aligned on the
shaft.

4] either buy a new one, or have someone rebuild yours for you. I've got
a '73 throttle body w/o vacuum advance if you're interested. This one is
only equiped with vacuum retard. I can't make any guarantees that it's
any better than the one you've got however.

> 5.  Can anyone tell me how/when the decel valve works?

It takes vacuum input from above and below the throttle plate. When the
throttle closes, there is a large gradient in the vacuum, and the decel
valve bleeds a little of that off. I believe that is was designed to
reduce a full-rich overrun condition. High vacuum, the brain sends lots
of fuel and if there's no air from the throttle, you get a very rich
mixture. If you watch some of the SCCA trans am cars they have an
extreem case of full-rich overrun, wahtch the flames pouring out of the
exhaust pipes whenever they lift going into a turn, lot's of unburnt
fuel. The decel valve is adjustable, and can also be used to compensate
for a lightened flywheel and keep the revs from dropping too quickly.
That's not it's intended design, but that's a good reason to keep it.

Just remember that vacuum leaks anywhere below the throttle could cause
high idle and lean running. So make sure all those hoses are sealing
well first before tearing into components that may already be working
fine.
