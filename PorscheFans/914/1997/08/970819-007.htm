I am considering running xcross next year. At this time, I am trying to g=
et
my 914-1.8 into shape to do so. Of concern is the trans and the fuel
system.
I have developed a sense that the side shifter trans is better than most.=
 I
have been told that a '75 should have this kind, but I am not sure how to=

tell, plus I think my power plant is from a prior year. The trans that I
have has a plastic cover on the bottom of the unit, where the shift linka=
ge
ties to the ball end. I have seen a trans with the cover on the LH side a=
nd
suppose this is a side shifter. Is that correct? =

I am looking at a side shifter trans from a guy on the west coast. It has=

been rebuilt and includes all the linkages. He is asking $700 plus
shipping. Is that the going price and is it going to be that much better.=
 I
am destined to pull my trans since the 1st and 2nd synchros have died
(double clutched downshifts suck). Buy or rebuild, that is the question.
I have been watching the trials and tribulations of others who are
converting back to FI. I am currently carbed (a single progressive two
barrel) and want to get better performance. I see lots of conversion kits=

out there, new or used, for a dual weber carb set up in varying sizes. Th=
e
question is where do I get the best bag for the buck. I am told the engin=
e
has a mild European (H grind) race cam and suspect that dual carbs are th=
e
best way to go. Any advice??
