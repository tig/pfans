Mike:

My name is Beth, the real owner of Jim Thorusen's 914. My dad said
that I could reply to your question.

I just went out and looked at my Porsche, and the side port of the
regulator is connected to the fuel rail, and the end port is the
return to the fuel tank.

    I'm pretty sure that this is correct, because my dad has a
pressure gauge and has set the presure to 28 psi as recommended. Hope
this helps.
