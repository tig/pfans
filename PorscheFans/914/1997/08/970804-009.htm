Hi 914 Drivers

I don't drive the car a whole lot but have noticed a problem in the past few
weeks with the idle. Once the oil temp reaches 180 the car will stall at a
stop light. I have checked the vacum lines, contacts, etc. and have tried to
adjust the idle screw at the throttle. I can't get the idle to move up at all
after the car reaches  normal operating temp. I checked the head temp
resistence (1.75) with the engine off   and an outside air temp of 90% (It's
hot in Arkansas right now). I have checked the vacum lines, vent hoses, etc.
The car runs just fine once I start driving. I suspect a rich mixture since I
have to hold the throttle to the floor in order to start the car at the
light. My next thought was the cold start valve and tried to check for
continuity (Haynes) manual. Probably don't know how to do this. I purchased
 a multimeter from the local radiio shack and thought that if I connected the
plug and the sensor  I should get a different reading at dc than without
anything being attached. I don;t think I have any problems with ignition
since the car runs fine. I have a Pertronix system. 
Any ideas.? Its kind of tought to keep starting the engine at stoplights or
keeping my foot on the accelerator. Of course the A/C is turned off.

Thanks
