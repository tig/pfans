Howdy All, 

 Hey Rick, whats "Set a cookie" mean ?? No Bussiness from    you ?? Oh
well, David had been very good to me price wise, Since Im doing my 6
conversion on a buget, I shop around for EVERYTHING !! and if Im not
getting the best deal possible then I dont buy. Im not tring to sell you
on buying from him.  I just wanted everyone to know, he's out there and
had done good by me. Just like I have had great luck with Performance
Products, GPR (another Deal pending), Tweeks and countless others.

 Don
