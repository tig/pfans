BTDT 3 times, and worse it can be a genetic, my father does the same
thing.  He has the worlds oldest 914-6 restoration 1977 and still
counting.....  I my self will admit, cars come apart way to easy, and
always take 5 times longer (@ minimum) to rebuild.  As I said BTDT 3
times.  My Jeep is done, my 914 is back on the road, and my ghia,
well........  Better get back to the garage.  Oh I forgot, I did it to
two Astro vans, boy I must be a nut.  Now 5 times and counting.

Take care,
