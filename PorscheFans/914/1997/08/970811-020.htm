Hi folks,
I am now the proud owner of a '75 914, for a total of two weeks. I have
been watching Email go around and feel rather silly with my issues, but=85=
=2E
The frame of the car is 914, 2.0, but the actual engine is a 1.8L. The
engine now has an "H" grind cam, which I am told is a mild European cam.
The carb set up appears to be a progressive two-barrel suspended directly=

over the middle of the engine. All smog stuff, including the heating syst=
em
has been deep sixed. My guess is that the dist. is stock. The tranny is
also normal with all the usual worn out bushing in the linkage.
I have developed some questions:
Is having a 2.0 frame any advantage?
With the cam, the buggy idles rough. Anyone know how to settle it down? A=
ll
new points, plugs, wires. Dwell right on the mark, timing is another stor=
y.

For the timing, the Haynes book seems to tell me that 7.5 BTC is right fo=
r
the 1.8. Does that sound right?
The dist advance has vacuum two lines going to it. They are driving me
crazy trying to set the idle RPM. Has the mechanics of the distributor
died? Time for a new one?
The tranny has lost first and second synchros. Is it a brutal job to do a=

tear down on the tranny? How about expense? I have seen some rebuilts
kicking around. Is that the way to go?
What the heck is a side shifter?
I have been trying to quiet it down a bit.  It came with a straight thru
resonator and I put a Bursch system on it, to some success. It actually
sounds like there is a hole in the system. It makes a popping noise,
typical of the VW sound. Any one have ideas. Exhaust and intake bolts
appear  to be fine. =

The carb appears to be a home fit job. There must be something better tha=
n
this? I suppose I should be looking for something that will compliment th=
e
cam. It also burns hugely rich. Any advice on the carb is appreciated.
Should I convert to dual webers? What size?
Last one for this pass. In an effort to quiet the exhaust, so I could
listen for a manifold leak, I placed a rag over the pipe for a few second=
s.
I noticed a funny thing. The rag was being sucked into the pipe between
exhaust strokes. Is that normal? =

Thanks in advance for listening and for any advise you can offer.
Rich Coventry
