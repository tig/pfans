He said that? That bastard. I'll never vote for him again! I read somewhere
that the polution from cars is only 5% of the total polution. The vast
majority comes from industry. They have the big bucks, so they get away
with murder. Also, a good percentage (some say up to half) of the polution
in the northeast comes from dirty smokestacks inthe Ohio, Indiana and
Illinois areas. We get other people's polution,so we are being forced to
tighten up. Not fair.

Further, there are so few older cars around here that's it's laughable that
they are trying to go after them. I've seen maybe 5 914's in 2 years, 2 bmw
bavarias, and maybe 5 bmw 2002's. There are extremely few old cars spewing
smoke, but plenty of dodge caravans with smokey tailpipes.

This is how I understand the imposition of emissions testing works in most
places. The epa has the power to withold highway funds if a region is
labeled a "nonatainment" zone. This is millions of dollars in federal money
for building roads. The epa basically uses this as a threat to force areas
to come up with solutions and the epa is ready to step in tell these areas
what to do to clean up thier air. What got the law makers around here so
pissed off at the epa was that the epa *could not* prove that implimenting
a california style emissions testing program would solve our dirty air
problem. The epa was extremely inflexible according to the law makers I
talked to regarding how to change the emissions testing in this area. Since
the epa could not prove thier case, virginia refused to spend the millions
of dollars to build centralized dynamometer testing facilities. Virginia
took epa to court and won. What I am being subjected to now is aparently a
mild compromise that the parties worked out themselves. I sure as hell
don't remember reading about any hearings on these issues.

To find out if this is in store for you, contact your elected reps, your
environmental department, and visit the epa web site to see if you are
listed on the "nonttainment" list. If you're in a rural area, you probably
have nothing to worry about.
