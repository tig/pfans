In a message dated 8/24/97 7:27:41 PM Central Daylight Time, you write:

<< OK, tell me if I have this correct.  In 1970, a 914/6 won it's class
(under
 2litres).  I've seen a picture from the race on Tim's web site, and it
 looks like a 911 is right behind the 914/6 in a chicane.  Now, weren't the
 911's also in the under 2 liter class? Did the 914/6 actually beat the 911?
>>

In 1970, the 2.2 liter 911 had just come out, and the factory made racing
versions.  In fact the preparation instructions are in the same manual as the
ones for the 914/6 GT.  The early GT's ran in Group 4, and after 1000 were
produced ran in Group 3, I THINK!!  911s ran in Group 2 and Group 3; special
911S'  ran in Group 4, I believe.  I don't know if there were subclasses by
displacement or not.

There may have been some 2.0 liter 911s there, which should have been in the
same class.  If the #40 Sonauto GT beat any of the 2.2 liters, I don't know.
