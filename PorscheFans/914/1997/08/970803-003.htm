Hi gang,

I've used platinum plugs in the past, and found out two things:

1.  The cheapie platinum plugs are junk.  The electrode *will* recede into
the insulator after a short (6-8k) time, rendering the plug junk, and
possibly frying your coil.  This is in *all* types of engines, not just our
T-IV.

2.  The good platinum plugs are expen$ive.  The ones in the G60 Corrado,
for instance, are about $80/set.  These ones DO work, and if you look at
the electrodes, this one looks like a regular spark plug, one without the
"wire" center electrode.  When you check the plugs at 12k & 24k intervals,
they look "as new."  So what?  I can buy 10 sets of plugs for this.  And
that means 60-120k of spark plugs.  You *do* check your plugs at every
valve adjustment, right?

This leads me to recommend a normal copper plug.  I've been running w7cc in
my 2.0 914, and I've *always* run w8dtc (triple electrode) in the
rabbit/golf/jetta engines, with excellent results.  

cheers, Brian
