Nick,

It seems to be common knowledge that the 914 2.0 Fuchs (the real thing, not
a copy) is the lightest stock wheel, and allows the fattest tires.  You can
easily get a 205/60 or 205/50 onto this wheel, and still clear the stock
fenders.

I weighed my 195/50zr15 Dunlop D40-M2 on my 2.0 Fuchs, and it's something
like 34 lbs.  (or was that 37 lbs?  can't remember)  Typical mag + tire
combination weighs 40+ lbs in this size.

I'm running 205/50zr15 BFG R1 (old generation) tires on Empi-style 8 spoke
wheels for autoX.  They barely fit, I had to clearance the p*ss out of the
fender lip.  I think these have 1/4" or so less back spacing.  They give me
much better grip, but the car feels slower on acceleration.  Probably a
combination of wheel weight and diameter (gearing) change.  I might do the
8-tire swap-a-rooni next season, when I get new R1s.  I wish I could afford
to put the R1s on 15x7" Revolution RFX wheels 8-)

The empi 5 won't fit, and the empi-style 8 is much heavier than the 2.0
fuchs.

cheers, Brian
