>Well, I took the plunge and removed my faithful
>(fitful?) Webers this weekend and installed the
>off-the-car-for-15-years d-jetronic FI stuff on my 74 2.0.

Well, I checked everything out last night and here's what I found:

1.  If you don't re-connect the vacuum line from the throttle body to
the distributor after setting the timing, the idle will be 800 - 1000
rpm high.  DOHH!!!

2.  As suspected and supported by several of you, the Aux. Air regulator
wasn't closing.  After plugging the intake side, the idle dropped
another 800 - 1000, bringing me down to about 1200 rpm - not too bad,
but still seems high.

3.  My temp sensor II needs replacing.  Ohms, cold were only 1050 and
when the car finally died (more on this later), and the oil temp was
starting to come up, it measured at only 46 ohm - too low as I
understand it.  I was told that lower ohms = leaner running and as the
engine got hotter and hotter it ran leaner and leaner.  About the time
the ohms dropped below 100, it started 'lean hunting' and withing
another 30 seconds, it died completely.  I was not able to re-start it
until it cooled for 4 or 5 hours (and the ohms were back up to about
900) so I conclude that this is my primary problem at this point.

4.  I couldn't find any air leaks (using the
carb-cleaner-sprayed-in-various-places method).

5.  I have a big question about the fuel pressure regulator!  I don't
have a pressure gauge yet (should be here by tomorrow) so haven't been
able to check my pressure, but I'm worried I've got my regulator hooked
up backwards.  In Dave Darling's diagram, it shows that the fuel line
goes from the END of the regulator into the drivers side fuel rail and
the line from the SIDE of the regulator goes to the "Y" that branches to
the fuel pump and the return to the gas tank.

In the Haynes manual and in Muir's "How to keep your VW alive", it shows
just the opposite.  Which way is correct (74 2.0) or doesn't it make a
rat's butt of difference???

Thanks to all who have already helped me with this project and in
advance to anyone else who's willing to share their knowledge.

74 2.0 (soon.. very soon.. to be fuel injected)
