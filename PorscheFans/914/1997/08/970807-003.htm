I don't know if this will apply, but I suffered the same behavior for a
long time while I was trying to get my heat exchangers to make a good
seal with the heads.  If they were loose at all (like when the studs
were loose in the heads), then it would crackle when I let off the gas,
but only if it was below about 3000 rpm.  Above that, it was fine, but
decelerating from 5500 rpm would result in crackling right at 3000 (and
down) every time.  You might want to crawl under your car and re-torque
the exhaust.

Hope this helps,
