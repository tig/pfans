Good timing on this as I have similar questions.

I have 911 Fuchs.  They were mounted with 4-5 lug wheel adapters from the
PO.  I got  5 lug converted rear hubs and studded front rotors ( with long
studs) from a swap meet.  The rears are done and this weekend I got the
front rotors swapped over.  Went to mount the front tires last night and
discovered they won't sit flat.  Apparently the stock 914 rims or like the
EMPI style rims I have from a parts car have a larger ID on the inside so
it can clear the raised lip on the rotor that is around the grease cap.
The 911 Fuchs don't have this clearance.  I had been planning to cut down
the studs, lucky I didn't yet.

I'm assuming I'll have to use wheel spacers or is there some other option I
don't know about?

A quick measurement showed about a 1/2" lip so I'll need at least that
much.  I looked at the Automotion catalog and they have 5/16" spacers for a
911 listed,  can spacers be safely stacked?   I assume these would be what
I need rather than the 1/4" ones listed for the 914-4 since I have the 5
lug 911 Fuchs?

I know Troutman makes adapters, anyone know if he makes about a 1/2"  size
and what the prices are?  I see him at the Pomona swap meet and would like
to get a set at the swap this Sunday if that is what I need.  Until then I
have no front wheels.

Oh, the current tires are 185/65R15 and I've been thinking when I get new
ones to go for 195/60's.  I have stock fenders, no flares, and the 185/65's
fit with those wheel adapters that were about 1" thick.  I haven't checked
the actual offset of the 911 rims compared to stock rims.  Any potential
problems with 195/60's and about 1/2" spacers under stock fenders?

"hub-centric" spacers, for my 7" fuchs? I need to get this right the first
time.
