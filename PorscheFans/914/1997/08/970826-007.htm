	I think that this will be my last post on (this incarnation of)
this subject, lest we get into a real flame-war.

	Two more advantages for any reasonably-designed FI system over
most carb set-ups for the 914:  Starting behavior, and driveability.  I
have yet to hear of anyone's carb set-up on the 914 that runs well on
start-up.  Many (but not all) of the carbs suffer some serious driveability
problems as well--spitting, sputtering, backfires, the "well-known off-
idle sag of Webers" (to quote from a well-known catalog or two)...
	Carbs, as Brett pointed out, do not adjust very well to changing
outside conditions (humidity, barometric pressure, etc.).
	The stock FI just works better on a stock motor.

Dirk sez:

	The point is that the heads and cam are the real bottleneck, not
the induction system.  A short, wide manifold (like dual carbs have) is
good for high-RPM air flow, but acutally impedes low-RPM flow.  A longer,
narrower manifold (like the FI has) is bad for the top-end, but actually
better for low- to mid-range.  [This all falls into "fluid dynamics", which
is a field I have no real hope of understanding.  But that's the way that
manifolds work.]
	All US-spec 914s run out of breath at relatively modest RPMs.  Most
make very little torque over 5000 RPM; you can actually feel the power drop
off somewhere between 4500 and 5000.  What you get in return is reasonably-
good low-end torque for a VERY low-compression four-banger.  There's a good
but of torque down at 2500 RPM.
	Compare that to (arbitrary example) my CRX, which is nearly gutless
below 4500, then pulls rather strongly almost up to the 6500 RPM red-line.
They are very different cars.
	The heads and the cam are the main bottleneck to air flow.  As
Josh2 said, it don't matter if the intake will flow a zillion CFM if the
stuff the intake is bolted to will only flow a thousand CFM.
	If you're changing your cam profile, you have to split the case--
you are now doing a full rebuild.  (Might as well replace those main bear-
ings, etc., etc., etc.)  There also seems not to be a whole lot you can do
to the heads without considerably shortening their lifespan.  Most of the
race-cars (where high-RPM flow is REALLY important) don't get very many
seasons out of a pair of heads before major crack-fixing is necessary.
	What I'm trying to say is that without major cash-flow, the 914
motor will never be a rev-happy little monster.  Therefore, the ultimate
flow-rate of the intake system is not that critical; the low-RPM flow rate
is much more important.

	I think that Josh2 and Brett have made most of the other points
for me.
	The only reply that I can make to your satements that carbs are
simpler and easier to fix is, "not for me."  As far as I can tell, all
carbs work by smoke and mirrors.  You put them on and something just...
happens.
	The FI is a system I can wrap my brain around.  The ECU is just a
black box--true.  There's a lot of smoke and mirrors in there, too!  Ask
RD about how electricity works (from a Lucas point of view).  But the rest
of the system makes sense to me.  You can check the wires, you can test
the components.  You can even modify the behavior of the system by using
the factory-installed adjusters (fuel pressure, idle mixture, MPS setting)
by turning a single knob apiece!  How do you change the idle mixture on a
pair of carbs?
	The FI is an active system.  It (more or less) measures the load
and RPM of the engine, and then actively PUTS the "correct" amount of fuel
into the intake port.  Carbs are a passive system.  If you set it up cor-
rectly, the "correct" amount of fuel "falls into" the air-stream just after
the throttle plate.

	Now, as I have mentioned, I *do* have a (somewhat) irrational bias
against carbs.  My only experience with carbs has been on a different car,
a Honda Accord.  All I could do was stare at it, there were virtually no
user-serviceable parts to the thing.  If I'd grown up tweaking on American
Iron for fun, I would probably understand how carbs work pretty well.  But
I didn't; I grew up playing with computers.  I can understand how the D-jet
EFI (emphasis on the E) works, more or less.  It makes sense to me.
	Give me D-jet, or give me Motec.

	Maybe we'll have to agree to disagree, eh?
