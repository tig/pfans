For those that have been following (and helping with) my FI trials and
tribulations, here's the latest:

1.  I bought a 0-1500 ohm potentiometer and installed it between my head
temp sensor and the harness.  This took care of the lean-running problem
and made starting the car much easier.  I ordered a new sensor and will
install it next week when it gets here (along with new FI seals,
mainfold hoses, trigger points, contact points, condensor, etc.).

2.  My fuel pressure gauge should be here today, but I probably won't
have time to install it until tomorrow night - we've got our monthly PCA
meeting tonight.

3.  The car starts up fine, runs fine (still idles a little high -
around 1400), sounds good, but once it gets hot, it quits.  It really
acts like it is vapor-locking!  When it quits, I see air bubbles
back-washing into the fuel filter and the car won't re-start.  After it
sits for 15 minutes and I turn the key on and off several times to pump
fuel, it will start just fine and run for a while again.  Then, all of a
sudden, it lean-hunts about 3 times then craps out again.  Will a fuel
pressure gauge give me any indication if vapor-lock is occurring?  Maybe
I just don't have enough pressure in the lines.  Hopefully the gauge
will make this clear.

4.  The high idle (1400 rpm) may be due to worn bushings in the throttle
body.  I can push the throttle plate with my finger and drop the idle by
about 500rpm - seems like its not sealing good or closing all the way
(even though it looks like it is closed.  Is there a home remedy for
this or am I screwed on this count?

5.  Can anyone tell me how/when the decel valve works?

Thanks
