Car Guys  (AKA Keenly) do a very nice job, they draw from PCA instructors 
in the area and they are run well. They are not cheap but you get what you 
pay for.

I have taught for them and they are a good place to go.

If you are in the PA-MD-VA area you might try BSR's FATT program ( it runs 
once or twice a month on Fridays (Friday at the track).

The Potomac Drivers Ed program is one of the best at 1/2 to 1/3 the other 
for profit programs, in many cases the same instructors.

Has anyone on the list been to or heard anything about the Car Guys
driving school?  They hold driving schools at many of the tracks in the
east.  I am considering attending one of their schools scheduled for
Road Atlanta.  The cost of the school is $450 for the Road Atlanta venue
which by the way is the most expensive venue.  The course consists of
two days of classroom and track education.  I want to make certain the
school is worth the money as the date I would like to attend conflicts
with the Alabama regions two-day DE event which are always very well
done and are much less expensive.
thanks
