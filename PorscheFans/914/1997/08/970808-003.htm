That's a good one!

Ironically, since this happened when I was leaving at the end of the 914
Reunion Rally, George was right there. After we roll started it, he hollered
"hot start kit" as I drove by.  I had not previously experienced hot start
problems, but that was the hardest run the car had had in a long time.

Now I'm not terribly mechanically inclined, but I wanted to diagnose as much
as I could to learn. After 20 minutes of thorough study of several technical
books and crawling around the car, I finally figured out where the starter
was. (As I said, I'm learning...)

The big breakthrough came when Jeff Canaday suggested jumpering the ignition
connection from the battery lead. That got it to start. So I took it to my
mechanic. The consensus is that the total failure to start problem was from
a very dirty connection on the ignition lead, but the starter was pretty old
and week and worth replacing anyway.

Thanks for the tips. I learn quite a lot every time my 914 needs some help.
