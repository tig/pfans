Yes, with netscape pull down, "Options|Network Preferences" and then hit
the "Protocols" file tab.  On the screen, check the box for "Accepting a
cookie".  From now on, whenever any server tries to submit a cookie to 
your client, you will be prompted as to whether you wish to accept it.

I do not know of a way to view the current list of cookies your client 
is holding, but if you are running Netscape they are located in a file
called "cookies.txt" in the Navigator directory.  You can freely edit
this file to view and/or delete any cookies you wish.

Cookies, by themselves are no great threat.  A much more critical issue
to personal privacy is the other information your browser sends out when
getting web pages or running cgi-bin programs on remote servers.

If you have any other questions, let me know.
