Oh man, you didn't have to buy that tool. I should get a FAQ together about
this. Anyway, removal will take some pounding. You have to completely
remove the axle, of course, and probably the exhaust on that side. I used a
big 3# hammer and a 1/2" drive breaker bar as a "pusher" to pound out the
hub and the bearing. First comes the hub, then you remove the retaining
ring, then pound out the bearing. Use lots of penetrating oil. Paint the
hub while you have it out, but not the part that goes into the bearing.
Take some sandpaper to the trailing arm and remove all traces of rust.
Clean it up real good, then put a thin coating of antiseize on the trailing
arm. Then you could ahve used my special tool #1 to install the bearing.
Instead use Automotion's tool. Dont' worry about getting the bearing cold,
it's not that hard to install.

With the bearing in the arm, install the freshly painted reatining ring :).
and paiont those bolt heads after you tighten them up real good. use a
locking compound on the retaining bolt threads. To install the hub into the
bearing inner race with damaging anything, use my specail tool #2, which
consists of a 5" length of 3/8" threaded bolt, two washers and a nut. The
hex size is 15/16" for both the nut and bolt. insert the bolt from the back
with a washer on it, put the hub on the bolt, slide another washer (which
just happens to fit perfectly into the recess in the hub) and thread the
nut on. Make sure you have a littel grease on the threads before you do
this. You'll need a 15/16" socket and 15/16" combination wrench. The socket
goes on the bolt in the back, the wrnech on the nut. make sure you put a
little antiseize on the part of the hub that goes into the bearing. You
then simply tighten the nut and the hub slides into the bearing real nice.
then, install a stub axle after removing the 3/8" bolt and nut.the bearing
needs the stub axle to stay together. Hope this helps
