First:  Welcome to the happy 914 family.


Your front end problem is *probably* bad bearings or shocks.  Could
be as simple as out of balance wheels.

Because your car does not have the origonal motor, I would
suspect a "DPO" problem.  (DPO:  Dreaded Previous Owner.  Typically
NOT a very good mechanic.)

Seals can be gotten at GPR, or any of the other places mentioned
in the FAQ.  (GPR:  800-321-5432)

911 struts allow better brakes, and 5-lug wheels.  Other than that,
no real advantage.

Fuchs are common at swap meets.  Expect to pay $100 each if you're
NOT looking for them, $150+ if you are....  (don't ask  :)
