OK, I've thought about this out loud for a bit, and I've concluded that
epoxy paint is the easist way for amatuers like us. The problem is the
combined need for heat resistance and brake fluid resistance. If you're like
me, you'll get brake fluid on your calipers once in a while. The calipers
ahve to be blasted to get down to bare metal before painting, otherwise the
rust will just creep under the paint. If you really wanted to go whoel hog,
then get them zinc chromate plated after balsting, then paint them with
epoxy paint. Epoxy paint is available from model airplane suppliers.

Between the caliper halves are a couple of rubber O rings that will melt if
usbjected to the 600degF of the powder coating oven. That's why powder
coating is a bad idea in this case. I've been told that spliting the
calipers is also a bad idea because they tend to leak afterwards. 

Anodizing is only for non-ferrous metals. Unless you have aluminum calipers,
it won't work. The problem with anodizing is that all ferrous metals have to
be removed from the part before getting dipped into the anodizing solutoin.
The solution eats ferrous metals and causes a chemical reaction where the
ferrous metal touches the aluminum. So, you would have to completely strip
the calipers to anodize them. They would dissipate heat a little better with
anodizing, because the coefficient of radiation increases for an anodized
part. Radaition is not a main mode of heat transfer in calipers, though, so
the effect would be marginal.
