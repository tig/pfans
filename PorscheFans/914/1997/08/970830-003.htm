Exactly! And by the way, the car I drove sounds -NOTHING- like a street
going RX-7. A trully awsome scream when the engine kicks to life at
around 5,500 rpm and then it just cranks it out all the way up to 10,000
rpm. And it's actually not excessively loud. Well, yes it is loud, but
not like it was last year though...:)

Then he has some more work to do, and should drive it harder (and he
should get a 13B). That rev limiter is only there as a reminder to the
average driver that they should shift. There's still a good couple
thousand rpm beyond that annoying bell. Oh, for those that don't know,
an RX-7 does not have a rev-limiter really, just a rev warning. The
engine can still keep going, the buzzer will just keep going off. So
just disconect the sucker! Oh yeah, and programable FI is worth ALOT of
extra power out of the rotary motor. Like another 90HP!
 
> Maybe someday, but I still can't get over the sound...

It's the ringing in your ears the next day that takes some getting used
to. Blasting down the back straight at 9,500 rpm is not for sensitive
ears. Ear plugs help too. It's kind of like when Honda first introduced
the V4 interceptor to racing. You'd see a couple bikes come out of a
turn clicking up through the gears waaaahhh-waaaahhh-waaaahhh, and then
the interceptor would come rocketing by wwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh,
and all you could do was scream "SHIFT!" as it blew past everyone. A
friend of mine discovered (under unusual circumstances) that the
interceptor engine had a totally new power band at 14,000 rpm that made
the 9,000 rpm power band (and successive 11,000 rpm redline) seem like
chicken feed.
