I am looking to sell my 914.  Got a job as a stockerbroker trainee.  And
I don't make next to nothing right now.

72 914
With a engine from a 74(so I am told) with 40k miles on it.
new weber carbs.
Sway bar in front
fuchs(spelled right?) wheels
Monza Exuast
NEW Guards Red Paint(3 Weeks Old)
New Carpet
Good Interior
Runs well

What is a good asking price for this car.  Just spent $800 for the paint
job less then a month ago.  The previous owner put new weber carbs on
it(I think the old engine had an engine fire or blew up, so he put
another engine with 40K on it and new weber carbs.)  He was going to
race it, so he point a sway bar up front, monza exaust and I was told
911 brakes were added.  The rims are real nice.  They fill the wheel
well up real nice.

Looking for an asking price, or even better a buyer.  The car is in NJ,
either in New Brunswick or Middletown...
