Hi Brett,

> Did all 2.0s come with sway bars?  

Nope, not all of them.  I believe they were part of the "sport group."

No big deal.  73s and 74s are identical.  Yours has the console (appearance
group) but happens to be missing the swaybars, which aren't important if
you're autoX because you'll want to upgrade the front one anyways. 

This car also comes with a/c.  If you're not running the a/c, be sure to
plug the big hole in the sheetmetal that the compressor leaves behind.

The spare 2.0 engine is also a big asset.  Even if you just rebuild the
heads on the thing, you can sell them for $500 each.  Or you can be like me
and hoard the puppies, and work on building a killer street engine, or
blueprint the thing for autoX.

So what?  Go and buy some 140# springs and a 22mm front s/b and a set of
Konis.  Put the shocks in while you do the springs and s/b so that you only
have the car apart once, and only have to align it once.  Leave the rear
s/b out.

Sounds reasonable, when you figure in the new engine ($2k) battery tray
repair and cherry interior.  If you're serious about autoX, see if you can
get a spare set of wheels thrown into the deal.  

cheers, Brian
