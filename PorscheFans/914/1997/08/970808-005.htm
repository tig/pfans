O.K., here's my guess.  I think your exhaust is loose at the heads.
When mine was loose, the valves sounded terribly loud when cold, but as
it warmed up, it got better.  I imagine that this was due to the exhaust
expanding and partially sealing against the heads.  When you adjusted
your valves the second time around, were they out of spec?  Do you have
any backfiring or crackling?  I'd crawl under your car and re-torque the
exhaust (it's deceptively small - like 14 ft/lbs).  If you didn't
replace the copper exhaust gaskets in your heads, do so now.

Good Luck!
