Thanks for the advice.  I did a compression test right after it started
blowing smoke, and it was good (120-125lbs.) all around.  That's what
led me to beleive that it must be the oil scraper rings.  But when I
took them off, they looked all good.  Also, the car runs as strong as it
ever did.

What I can't understand is the way it smokes.  It will sit there running
at idle with no smoke.  It's only when I start driving it, and then
after about 5-10 min it will start to smoke.  It gets considerably worse
under a load (like going up a hill), and then clear up again.

I drove it around, on and off, for a bout 2 hours.  The oil level went
down to the second line, but then stayed there.  Before I did the ring
job, it would go through 2 quarts in 10 min.

The carb is a single Holley 2 barrel (5200), and I have a book.  I think
it got some dirt in the needle and seat mechanism.

Thanks again
