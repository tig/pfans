Dave,
Patience now, it wouldn't be gratifying nor characterstic if it weren't
obscure and somewhat difficult.

I don't recall nut size - nothing special - 8mm or 10mm sounds right -
think I was using 1/8" ratchet so it would be a small socket OD.
Once you remove the glass, there is another nut behind the plastic
shell for vertical adjustment (within the housing and behind the glass) 
Remove and clean this assembly as well. Cleaning may require some
effort if there is significant corrosion. I actually did 2 mirrors and
both cleaned up fine. (I also polished them while off the car - what an
extremist).

To remove the glass, pry between the thin black plastic retaining ring
and the lip of the aluminum shell with a fine screwdriver (think I started
in the top middle and worked my way around until it freed up enough to
pull out). Try different points around the circumference until it begins
move more freely then get good leverage and just pry it out. Careful
though you need to reuse it (just pops back in).

BTW, anyone have two (clean) OEM mirror retaining screws for sale?

Have fun!
