    I think the 2.2-liter 911s were already racing in 1970, Dirk, but
    I could EASILY be wrong.

> Did the 914/6 actually beat the 911?

    Yes, and it also beat about half a dozen Ferrari 512s, Vic
    Elford's pole-sitting 917, the three Wyer Gulf-Porsche 917s, and
    three dozen other cars, including the 908 camera car that was
    being used to film Steve Mcqueen's "Le Mans" movie.

    Doubtful... I mean, I'm as willing as the next guy to brag about
    the 914's sixth-overall finish in 1970, but the truth is that
    the rain was POURING down that year and most of the really fast
    cars either crashed out or retired due to water-related
    electrical/engine problems.  In fact, only 17 cars (of 50 that
    started the race) even finished.

    Here's a fact that might put that 6th-place finish in
    perspective:  The 908 that was carrying the movie cameras had to
    stop NUMEROUS times during the race to reload with film, and had
    to deliberately slow down a lot in order to capture specific
    shots, yet it STILL finished in eighth place overall.

    Uh... I don't think so.
