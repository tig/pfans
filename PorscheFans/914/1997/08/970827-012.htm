Not much less of a pain than using CHT or EGT to run the FI. Ideally I'd
use CHT as that is what ultimately is needed to keep the warmup mixture
right. Oil warms up way too slowly and by the time the oil is at optimal
temperature, you've been running rich for quite a while. Remember, in a
water pumper, the coolant is allowed to warm up very quickly by
remaining inside the engine (thermostat control) and is also closer to
the combustion chamber than our oil is to ours. I'm anticipating using
CHT for my FI design. I'd also like to use EGT if I can set it up
properly. Might be better that way to allow the car run closed loop
without destroying expensive O2 sensors.
