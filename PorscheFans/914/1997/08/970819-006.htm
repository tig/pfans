That sounds a little high for actual mph, but it would depend on your
tire size.  On my 74 2.0 with 195/60/15 tires, 50mph (actual) is about
2600rpm.  Of course, 50mph as indicated on the speedo would be about
2300rpm for me.

These 2 are more than likely symptoms of the same problem.  If some bozo
put a single filament bulb in your front turn blinker(s), that would
cause what you are saying.  Also, check to the wires where they connect
to the bulb assembly to make sure they're hooked up correctly.

I had a similar problem when I got my 914:  Some bozo (OK, it was me,
but there wasn't a bulb in there to begin with so how should I have
known) put a single filament bulb in the taillight/brakelight socket so
when I turned off the key with my foot on the brake, the engine would
continue to run.

Good luck and enjoy!
