Well, I can't say I've heard of cracked heads as a result of them, but I
can say that I've heard other 914 owners claim better performance with
the Bosch Copper Plugs.  FWIW, I have a hunch that it's more
coincidence.  When people see commercials advertising the virtues of
platinum plugs, they tend to use them more often.  914 heads tend to
crack around the spark plug holes naturally, so put the two unrelated
items together, and it superficially appears that there's a connection.
