An alternative is to do what George Wright did to his.  I saw it when I was
picking up my 914 after he'd done some work on it and also machined my 320i
calipers (I'll actually get them installed some day).

He had 2 of the hydraulic struts like are used on hatchbacks etc.  He said
they were a standard one from a FLAPS, they had brackets on one end already
and he made brackets for the other end from angle iron.  He has one of
those Rivnut tools that puts in a threaded insert like a pop-rivet and used
that to make mounting points on the fenders and trunk lid.  They were
spaced far enough out so the Targa top still fit in.  Removed the torsion
springs completely.  Not stock but looked good.

How to re-spring a trunk:  Don't.  That has been my tactic.  At least until
someone can recommend a decent solution so that the pivots won't break
again.
 The rear trunk springs are under a tremendous amount of torsion, and they
are that way
for 99.999% of the time.  In my opinion, the rear pivot points just aren't
designed
well enough to support that amount of shear stress / torsional stress.  Has
anyone
tried reinforcing the pivots themselves before they are welded on?  If
anyone
has
any suggestions as to how to reinstall these pivot points so that they will
not come off again, please speak up.  Until then, I will leave my rear hood
unsprung.
