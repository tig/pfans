Over the years, I have torn apart the ECU's for my '73 D-jet, '74 L-jet &
one of unknown origin (probably earlier, no CO adjustment). There were
significant differences in each circuit, physically, but I don't know how
much was due to changes in circuit technology over the years and how much
is due to differences in functional requirements. I didn't go any further
into the circuits than to assure that the transistors were capable of
firing the injectors, since when something electronic dies, it's usually
the device(s) handling the highest power. It will be interesting to see the
schematics. I thought I'd take the other approach - make a plug-in "diddle
box" to simulate the external inputs to the brain and show the outputs to
the injectors via LEDs.
