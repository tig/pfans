Most of you are probably sick of this ongoing story by now, but for
those few of you who aren't, here's the latest.

IT'S ALIVE!  Everything seems to be working pretty good.  And as
promised, I went out and made some 0 - 60mph (actual) runs before and
after the conversion.  Before (with dual 44IDFs well-setup and balanced)
I averaged 10.6 seconds for 5 aggressive, but not break-neck 0-60mph
runs.  After (with stock FI still not tuned entirely to my satisfaction)
I get 10.4 seconds average for the same scenario.  Not much difference,
but I'm surprised it isn't the other way around.  Without that deafening
roar behind my head, the car just doesn't SOUND like its going very
fast.

I still have to figure out how to determine if I'm running lean or rich
or just right.  Any rule-of-thumb stuff I can do without an O2 sensor or
an exhaust tester?

And I still need to do a flow and pattern test on my OLD OLD OLD fuel
injectors.  Obviously all 4 of them are working to some degee or I
wouldn't be running as good as I am, but I'll still test them when I get
the chance.

Thanks again to all who have been helping me.
