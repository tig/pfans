	Heh heh heh...
	Reminds me of my last autoX, a couple of weekends ago.  For
some reason, there were quite a number of newbies and rather few of
the "usual suspects".  I was also the only 914'er in attendance.
	There were a number of comments--things like, "What is that?
Is that a Porsche?"  "Gee, that's small!" and so forth.  (No NARP
remarks, though.)
	After my first run, one of the spectators told me that
attitudes had drastically changed--"Hey, lookit that thing go!"
"He really tosses that little car around!"  "How fast was that?"...
	I think some drivers of "other" Porsches (and other non-P
cars) acquired a new appreciation for the Good Doctor's throughbred
hybrid.

	Gotta love it!
