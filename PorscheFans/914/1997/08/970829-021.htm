That's an awfully vague question. Under whos rules?

Once again, under what rules? PCA? SCCA? Different clubs have very
different rules.

Great! More fun than anything else I've driven. Tough to be competetive
in SCCA though. B-stock, C-Street Prepared, D-Prepared, or D or
E-Modified. In B/S the 914 is in with the Miatas, and they pretty much
dominate. In C/SP, there really hasn't been a fully developed 914
campaigned nationally. Maybe it's not competetive in the class, maybe it
is, the jury's still out on that one. D-Prepared (where the 1.8 fits) is
a great class for the 914. Modified on the other hand is anyone's game.
How much money ya got?

> What tires do you use?  What pressures are good.

Pressures all depend on tires. If you're running on factory fuchs wheels
(15x5.5) then 205/50-15 is the tire for you. Brand is something
personal. I like the BFG R1, but others like the Hoosier Autocross
radial, and others like the Kumho V700, and others like the Yokohama
A008RSII. There's others as well. And different tires will require
different pressures. And different suspension settings and modifications
will dictate different pressures as well.

If the R1s are the right size (205/50-15), and your suspension is
relatively stock, then I'd say about 26-28 lbs pressure would be about
right.
 
Details, it's all in the details. If you're running in SCCA, then you'll
be in C/SP at the very least. The carbs wouldn't be allowed in Stock.
