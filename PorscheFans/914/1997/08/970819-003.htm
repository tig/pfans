I have the rickydo torsion bar tool that was made by Mike Cooley.

you can rent it from me:

	$100 deposit 
	 20 for first week.
	 10 per week thereafter: just to be sure it gets back to the 	  group.	

Proceeds go to Mike, who was unemployed a long time and no longer has a
914.  

It turns a hazardous operation into something manageable.
The last time I even fixed a hinge without even removing the trunklid.

The tool is a cobalt steel cylinder that grabs the t-bar in the long
section.  Then it is just a matter of rotating it with a couple of rods
that are included in the kit.

Except for one defective unit, I have had good luck with the replacement
hinge bases sold by Tweeks.  It is nearly a full circle, rather than the
minimal base that was original.  I have always installed the new one
using 1/8" steel pop rivets around the perimeter every half inch or so.
In 18 years of 914's I have never had to do one a second time.

The originals probably fail due to lacke of lube on the hinge bolt.
When it starts squeaking, it's time for some oil, followed by grease
later on.

SoCalif.
