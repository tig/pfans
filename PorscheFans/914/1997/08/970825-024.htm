Wow, this thread has grown like the wildfires were so famous for her in CA.

First off Ive had both street cars and race cars with both carbs and fuel
injection.

Carbed cars: 	1966 Mustang GT (street carbed)
		1965 Barracuda Formula S (Vintage Racer carbed)
		1972 Caldwell DB-13 (Vintage Formula Vee carbed)
FI cars:		1994 Dodge Dakota V8 (current daily driver FI)
		1996-97 Formula SAE cars (programmable FI and carbs)

I no longer own either ponycar nor the Vee for the simple reason that they
became a major headache.  Having to change jets for a particular track,
altitude, humidity, etc. and still not having the right set-up was
extremely frustrating and time consuming.  That and play with the choke (if
it had one) and cranking the thing for what seemed like forever to get it
to start.

The school Formula SAE race car has a Haltech F9 programmable fuel
injection system on it and boy do I love it.  If the coolant is cold
(meaning the engine is cold) the computer uses a cold start map and boom
the thing fires at the first press of the starter button.  once it warms up
it switches back to the race map and youre ready to rock.  For us
engineering students carbs are a black art like medieval alchemy...  If the
race car isnt running right, plug it in to a computer and it'll tell you
exactly what is wrong.  and believe me, when it comes down to it
programmable FI is far superior to carbs in almost every aspect from daily
driving to racing.  

Notice I said programmable...  My Dakota has FI on it as well.  If I want
to make it take advantage of premium gas I have to go out and put the new
"performance computer" on.  But I can change that computer faster than
anyone short of Smokey Yanuck can change jets.  There is also a safety
aspect too. There are far more areas where a carb can leak fuel the FI. 
Yes FI run at a higher pressure but this also necessitates higher quality
line.

Let me qualify my statement by saying that I have no experience with the
914's FI YET!  But even with all the problems that Ive been reading about
Id still take it over a carb any day... especially on a cold wet day that
I'll be driving to the mountains... that situation would give any carb a
hizzy fit.  My lack of experience with the D-Jet and my gobs of experience
with the Haltech F9 is what spurred me to ask about using the Haltech on
the 914... which I probably will do... just have to check my SCCA rule-book
first...

The preceding may have been exceedingly ramblesome and non-sensical but its
because the writer has too much homework for his own good...

Please direct flames to m professors...
