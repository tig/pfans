I've been following the discussion regarding the speed in 5th gear at certain
RPM's etc. (or per Seinfeld..yada, yada, yada)  Check out Up-Fixin Volume
VIII.  On page 59, Allan Caldwell gives a great explanation of transmission
and how they work in an excellent article titled:  "Get to Know Your
Transmission."  Russ Dickerson, on page 62, takes it one step further with
his article:  "The Designer Gearbox."   Both describe how to calculate your
speed in any gear at any RPM.  The formula is: 

Car Speed (mph) =                          (rpm) 60
                                            
                               (gear ratio) (ring and pinion ratio) (tire
revs/mile)

Gear ratio and ring and pinion information are found in your 914 manual, or
in many parts catalogs.  Tire revs/mile are available from the tire
manufacturers.

To make my speedometer accurate, I removed the bezel and glass cover and
pulled off the needle.  I then drove at a predetermined RPM and gear (which
yeilded a specific mph, per the calculations) and stuffed the needle back on.
 Barbaric, but it worked.
