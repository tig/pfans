The rings aren't seated yet. Keep driving it. However, you could have bent a
connecting rod by trying to start it while hydrolocked. You need to do both
a leak down and compression test now and in a thousand miles or so. If the
compression doesn't go up and one cylinder is down, then you've got
problems. Otherwise, keep driving it. Get some books on those carbs, too.
What are they, webers or dellortos? Keep an eye on the oil level too, of course.
