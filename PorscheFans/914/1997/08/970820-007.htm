The way I understand it, some of us are using published info on 
gear/speed ratios (ie 2600rpm in 5th = approx. 55mph, or whatever) to 
determine how far off their speedometers are due to changes in size from 
factory tires.

It seems to me that this published measurement must assume factory tire 
size, as even that number would change w/ a different rolling diameter 
tire. In other words, I don't believe you can just crank the tach up to 
xx rpm, and know your speed based on gearing alone, the rolling diameter 
of the tire would act as your final drive gear, changing the ratio. 

I guess you'd either need a special calibration machine, or at least 
pace some other vehicle w/ a trusty speedometer.

Forever lurking,
