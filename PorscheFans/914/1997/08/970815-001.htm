Now, I agree that the add was in the wrong magazine, and I'm sure the
company that paid for it will be putting the publisher's children through
college, but with all of this emissions testing being slapped on us, I think
it's interesting to draw a comparason between gun owner's rights and vehicle
owner's rights. As I undestand it, vehicle owner's don't have any "rights"
as in the legal sense, because driving is considered to legally be a
"privilege." We dont' have a right to own a car, but he have a right to
"bear" (ie, own) a weapon. 

In this area, cars over 21 years old were exempt from emissions testing.
Come October 9, cars back to 1968 will be tested. This retroactive testing
is obviously unfair, but since we don't have any "right" to own a car, they
apparently can turn the tables on us at any time. What would have been fair
would be to have all cars made after 1976 be subject to testing forever,
since they have to meet an emissions test right now. 

Another analogy is the Americans with Disabilities Act. This law is
retroactive in that it requires businesses to decronstuct, then reconstruct
thier place of business to accomodate the disabled within a certian time
frame. I think that owning a business comes under the "privilege" heading
and not the "rights" heading also, so I guess privileges can be revoked and
modified at the will of the state whereas rights are much less subject to
changes. 

I'm not an attorney, so I may not have any of this correct.
