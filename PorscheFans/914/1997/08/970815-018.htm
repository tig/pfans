Wow Dirk, you have insight!

I sure hope it never goes so far as having Janet Reno raiding the "Renegade
914
Cult Compound".  Remember what Al Gore said in his book: "The automobile is
the single greatest threat to the planet".

By the way, If a city comes under "non-attainment", does that mean that the
Federal
Government has juristiction in these matters?  Are they the ones that tell
the states
to start smog testing?  I'm here in Texas where we don't have smog testing
yet, 
but I would like to know what the warning signs are.

Thanks,
      Thomas
