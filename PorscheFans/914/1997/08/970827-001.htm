I recently took my 914 to a local machanic and he suggested I
re-arrange  how one of the vacuum lines were set up.

My car is carborated with a Holley 2 barrel, and there was a vacuum line
going from the oil spout to the carborator.  He said this was probably
not a good idea, and that it may be too much vacuum.  He suggested I re
route the line to the air filter housing which also had a fitting for a
hose.

I made the switch, but don't see much difference, but I'd be tempted to
say that it's not as responsive as it was.  Hmmmmm.

Should I have left it the way it was, or is this a better setup?
