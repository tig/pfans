	The stalling is almost always a sign that the head temp sensor
is dead or dying.  It might read OK when "cold" (and 90 F is cold to the
motor!) but show too much resistance when warm.  Measure the resistance
from the connector to ground when the engine is hot (and stalling).  You
should get a fairly low number, like around 200 ohms.  If you get a large
number (e.g., 2K ohms) replace the sender.
	You could also have a bad connection between the sender and the
wiring harness.  Make sure, when you put it back together, that the con-
nector is firmly seated.
	If this gives no improvement, remove the air cleaner from the air
flow meter, and reach in and push the flap with your hand (or carefully
with a screwdriver).  It should not stick anywhere along the range of
motion.  If it does, you'll probably need a new one.
	If the air flap seems fine, then remove the wiring connector from
the ECU.  You may need to pull the ECU out of the car to do this.  Anyway,
check continuity between the pin on the ECU (look in Haynes for the pin #)
and the head temp sensor connector.  A bad connection means you should
try replacing the temp sensor connector.  If that doesn't help the contin-
uity, you may have to replace the wire.  (Ech.  You don't want to...)

	Possible but unlikely.  You can check to see if the cold-start
valve is being activated by removing the plug that goes to it.  Then check
the resistance from each of the two pins in the connector to ground.  If
one of them reads a dead short (<5 ohms or so), the cold start valve is
being told to squirt.  If this is still the case after the engine has been
warmed up, then the thermo-time switch is bad, or the wire from the cold
start valve to the thermo-time switch has grounded somewhere.
	The valve could be leaking, but that still probably wouldn't cause
the car to flood when at idle.

	Check your timing and dwell first, if you at all can.  Also make
sure you're getting a nice spark at all four cylinders.  Then start checking
the fuel system, with lower-effort and less-destructive checks first.

	Good luck!
