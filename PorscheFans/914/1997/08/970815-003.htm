No, just a different thrill level, if setup correctly it should not be a
scary car at all.  Having your eye balls sucked into there sockets and
brain slosh is an aquired taste (pain), some of use live for it.  Now
that car would be truly setup correctly, if it can force your eye balls
back into your brain so you can see the inner workings of you cerebral
cortex.  Pull them out of the sockets on braking and blur your vision. 
It is fun to have  your vision narrowed when braking.  And when you go
around a corner, you feel your brain slosh to one side, do to the "G"
load, and you take advil as a preventative measure before driving the
car.  See not scary, just a different out look on life. <g>

Yes it is a 74 officially.

Grouped together.  What's the difference?  Well basically none, except
for what came on the car as a standard issue.  On a 73 you got every bell
and whistle item Porsche put on the 914 at that time. 

Chrome bumpers - with fog lights
Sway Bars 15 or 16 mm front 15 mm rear
Fuchs alloys
Console with gauges and the flip top third seat
Some other miscellaneous items.

In 74 you got the engine and had to order the items you wanted.  Which is
why I personally like working off a 74 chassis.  So not all 914 2.0L had
sway bars, and the only bar I keep from the stock setup is the rear
anyway.

If it had bars, it would be nice to have the original rear bar, but you
will be replacing the front with a larger unit at some time, so don't
fret.  And a lot of people prefer to run just a front bar, I happen to
like both front and rears.  But that is the world of preference, to each
their own.

Case in point, my 74 had bars, but that was it.  Black bumpers, no fogs,
no alloys, (yes styled steels), and no console.  And I like it that way! 
I have added driving lights instead of the fogs, and now have alloys. 
But I can not stand the center console, it eats up to much area for me in
the car.  But again it is personal preference.  Anyway my 74 came with a
combo gauge in the gas gauge for oil temp, very nice, IMHO.  And I own a
watch and a volt meter so how needs the other two instruments.  Sure a
clock is nice in a car, but most radios now come with the feature built
in, and they are much more reliable.

Sounds like a winner to me since he will repair the rusted sections, take
the car for an official inspection the extra $50-$100 will be well worth
it.  And then you may be able to point out other rust areas, and then
make a better educated guess.  An extra engine is mild frosting on the
cake, unless he has a test stand, it could be an expensive paper weight,
or it could work out great.  

Records are a nice plus, I like records.  Now if I can just find that
turn table and needle to play this vynal with. <g>

Depends, on market and your fiances.  Look at it this way, even if you
got it at $4000, all the rust had been repaired, you got an extra 2.0L
motor, and a clean car.  Since this car is at the bottom of the range of
prices you quoted, take it if you are comfortable with the deal and what
the owner says he/she will do.

You will also have the expenses of a new bar fronts Automaushin is now
just below $300.

Tires R1 or Kumhos both in the $!00-$150 each.  Read the rule book for
the class you want to run.  Stock classes keep the Fuchs (SCCA) in PCA
your are allowed up to 7" with points.  The 22mm front bar, and then good
shocks, I prefer Koni, but again it is your choice.  Read the rules,
rules, and rules.

IN PCA (P4 stock class) for example due to the rules I can run the
following:
7x15" wheels with 195-60 BFG R1s
22mm front torsion bars and 140 lbs rear springs
22mm front sway bar
16mm rear sway bar stock unit
LSD differential
914-6 front 911"M" caliper (really the interior brake system)
19mm master cylinder

All under stock class rules, boy PCA is leanant.

In SCCA stock class I am limited to change the following
Shocks ( stock type)
Front swaybar and tires, that is all.
Original width wheel with +/-.25" backspacing.

Enjoy the car and welcome to the 914 fold.

Take care,
