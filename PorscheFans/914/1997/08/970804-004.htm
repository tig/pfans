	This is not an option for people with 74-76 cars.  They are
supposed to check the engine serial number to make sure that it is
"allowed" for that type of car.  I say "supposed to" because the San
Jose office didn't give me any flack about having NO serial number,
but I know someone who went elsewhere and they checked EVERYTHING!
	Anyway, the 75-6 people will be SOL even it they don't check
the engine type, because they are listed in the "Book of All Automotive
Knowledge" that the station attendants have as needing a smog pump and
catalytic converter (at least if your car says that it's a CA emissions
vehicle).

	Just remember, if you are swapping engines to meet smog (which
is illegal, immoral, and quite possibly fattening or carcenogenic), you
need to find the "right" engine, complete with all the "external" stuff
like FI, smog pumps, exhaust, etc.

PS--Yes, Smog II *does* suck!
