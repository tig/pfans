I am trying to find a local to look at their car to gauge the finish
work needed for mine, and swap advice ( though I'm a bit short in that
department at this time.)
The reason is that the car I purchased is from nevada and appears to be
rust free??? It seems a bit untrue but none the less, I am in northern
VA, Fairfax to be a bit more specific.  The car is olympic blue - all of
it !! I would like to find a happy medium between the all blue and
somewhat stock.  The car is rebuilt but is going to need to have the
rest of the under coating off and resprayed the only problem is I have
no one to look up.  So if there is someone out there that wouldn't mind
being a big brother so to speak.  I can be contacted via E-Mail, I am
also a PCA member and a bit unsure of what that entails other than a
neat sticker and a magazine.
I enjoy the list and hope that it will come in handy when I start to
experience more serious quirks associated with this particular model.
Thank you
