What is shipwright's disease ...

In LBC terms it goes something like this: 

The glovebox light is out, I'll just replace the bulb, but look, the
contacts are a bit corroded, so I better put in a new socket. To do that I
have to pull out the glovebox itself, and look here! The heater is leaking.
I'll just pull off the leaking hose and whoops! The core is rusted.
Off with the dashboard, out with the heater core, and oh my, there's rot in
the firewall. IN the engine compartment, I take out the battery to
see the rot, and I can't weld the patch on it without taking out the engine,
so out with the hoist. While the engine's out I might as well rebuild
it, and the transmission and clutch. And I noticed that the shocks are shot,
so off with them, and the suspension bushings have seen better
days, but look! The spring tower's cracked, so I have to weld it, but I
can't get at it without removing the body, so.... 

....so replacing the glovebox bulb led to a frame-up restoration.
