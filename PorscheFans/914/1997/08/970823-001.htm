Good point! I listened to the advice of my dealer/installer who said
that due to the layout of the circuit board, it didn't matter, but I
didn't think about the heat issue.  FWIW, it has worked flawlessly for
over 2 months, but the location may very well shorten it's life. It'll
be easy to flip it over and mount it to a board within the wheel well.
