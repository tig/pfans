IMHO, all of the engine sheetmetal is important, and should be replaced as
came from the factory.  Proper cooling is very important to these engines.
Since your two sources of engine cooling are from good airflow around the
cylinders and heads, I would try to get the pieces back into their proper
location.  By the way, I did the same thing on my first rebuild a couple of
years ago, and I was able to refit the piece with a little loosening here
and readjusting there.  Just be patient.

The gradual opening of the cooling flaps helps heat the engine, and oil,
faster when it is cold.  This is most important when running FI, probably
not as big of a deal when running carbs.  Since most dual carb setups don't
have automatic chokes, these engines don't warm up very gracefully anyway.
Ask me how I know :).  Again, my first rebuild didn't include the
thermostat, and I ran the car for a year with no cooling problems, but that
was only in the Summer, with not as much fear of starting with 'cold' oil
in the sump.

Good luck, hope this helped.
