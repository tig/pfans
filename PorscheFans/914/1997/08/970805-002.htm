Well, I took the plunge and removed my faithful (fitful?) Webers this
weekend and installed the off-the-car-for-15-years d-jetronic FI stuff
on my 74 2.0.  Used all new hoses and lines.  Now I've got a few kinks
to work out!

I managed to get the car started (after flooding the injectors by
working the throttle with the key in the 'on' position), but when it
finally started, it wanted to idle about 2800 rpm.  And if I didn't pump
the accelerator frequently, it would start lean-hunting and eventually
die.

I kept it running to check my dwell (44 degrees - a little low, but OK
for starters) and set my timing (27 degrees at 2800 rpm - again, OK for
starters).  I'm guessing I either hooked up a hose to the wrong place or
I've got a BIG air leak or leaks and that's what is causing the extreme
high idle and lean condition.  I also suspect my cold start valve isn't
doing its thing.

Any suggestions where to start?

Thanks
Mike g.
