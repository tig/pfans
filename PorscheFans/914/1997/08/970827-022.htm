Hello 914 Conversion Fans, 

Well months have passed and I thought I would do a conversion update, ok
bragging about my car again. For the guys thinking about a conversion,
Just do it!!, but remember its NOT cheap in the least, Im told it can
be, but I cant do it that way. This month has been great parts wise, so
I ran the numbers and the 914-6 GT project just crossed the $13,500.00
mark and its still a rolling shell with tons of parts still to buy, like
a 3.2L motor, rebuild the trans, paint, rubber and alot of misc stuff.
At least Im down to the big dollar items, so I think about $15K and 2
years more     and it will be done, yes its slow, but I have a wife and
we all know how that "can" be with a project car..hahaha but as you can
see below, she's not to bad =8^)

 Goodies for this month;

 Factory Fuchs 16x8&9's polished/painted perfect (Kroush2001@aol.com)
and he has more.

 Vellios engine mount (new style)(PorscheParts@compuserve.com)

 SS twin tip sport muffler (new/Performance prod) Hope it sounds      
as good as it looks!!!

 Carrera cross drilled rotors (Troutman)(GPR lost the deal)

 GT front Valance with oil cooler duct and GT rockers panels   (Randy
Beck)

 944 Turbo Calipers (internet/944 list) 
  Same piston/pad size as 930

 914-6 washer bottle (buddy/swap meet)

  Keep the projects going and good luck, 

 Don
