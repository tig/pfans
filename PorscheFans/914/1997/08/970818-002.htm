Hey,

Time for me to finally ask a question, see all of use do it now and then.

Saturday I took, my 914 out for the first time in a long while.  Well did
the run up and down the street  Everything was close to fine.  A bad gas
pedal and a few annoyances nothing major.

So Out I went on an extended run, after about 25 minutes, I came to my
first stop sign in 15 minutes.  Prepping to stop, no brakes all the way
to the floor.  I get it stopped, down shifting and coming to a coast. 
Leave plenty of room.  the next sign about 2 miles down the road the same
thing.  I head back toward home.  5 miles latter and three stops nothing
gets better.  Park it in the garage and pop the front trunk to find brake
fluid out the cap and almost filling the catch area on the resivor.  So I
figure I had some air in the MC still.  and pushed the fluid up into the
brake resivor.

Left it alone for a few hours, had to goto a social function, came back
and decided to try the brakes, I got firm pedal again.  Since it was 2 am
I decided just to test in the garage.  Now my pedal is pretty firm,
hardly any play in the system and maybe a 1/2" of travel before pressure
build up.

So I bleed the system again, no air bubbles found.  I took the pads out
of the fronts which seem to drag just a little more than I would like. 
But pistons move back and forward with no binding or troubles.  The
ferodo pads are thinner new than my original pads where.  I can not find
a problem with the system.  Have a new (rebuilt MC on its way) but I
would like to figure this one out.  I have not had the heart to take it
back out and try it again.  If the pads did drag, and build up heat,
could that cause my problem?  I have never run into this one before.

My system consisted of the following components on this car.

17mm master cylinders
Stock front and rear calipers
SS brake lines
Ford HiPo brake fluid
No proportioning valve just a Tee out back.
Front pads are Ferodo street auto-x compound
The rears are a Metal Master pads (this is how I get my bias, hey it
works)

I have a 19mm master and a proportioning valve and adapters  coming, and
will then switch to M front calipers and change the back pads to Ferodos
to match the front.  

Take care,
