I'm not against them, but advertising in a car magazine just doesn't
appeal to me. If I want to read about what gun does what, who shoots
what, what has the most stopping power or whatever, I'll pick up a gun
magazine. Just because Dale Earnhardt shoots a gun doesn't mean it's a
rationale for advertising of this scale in a Magazine titled "European
Car". When was the last time you saw a car of european manufacture
competing in the Winston Cup? Same goes for anything else for that
matter, if Micheal Schumacher likes to chew tobacco, doesn't mean I'd
appreciate a 16 page add on all the different famous drivers who chew or
what kind of tobackies are out there fer chewin'.

And just so you don't think I'm out of line with respect to the
magazine, I spoke with one of the editors about this today, and he is
PISSED! I made a concerted effort to civil about it, and he beat me to
the punch. He was really mad that this was put into his publication.
Apparently the editor doesn't have authority over what adds go in or
not. The Publiserh, McMullen Argus, did it on their own. Apparently,
when this add went into Sport Compact Car not long ago, the phone rang
off the hook with complaints. And it's my understanding that EC has a
higher circulation than Sport Compact Car. You'd think they'd learn...

ACK! I can't fathom buying a slopnose as a representation of what an
ideal project 911 is to be. I don't think they looked very far though.

VW & Porsche was a great magazine, and so is EC. EC does get bogged down
in adds though sometimes. But I like reading about Italian and Brit cars
too...
