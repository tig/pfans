    Yeah... 914 owners are often the cause; they add camber in an
    effort to improve their cars' handling.

    If the trailing arms aren't boxed and the car has a powerful
    motor driving sticky tires, they do... But it's not a permanent
    deformation; they just flex under load.

    The 914 can tolerate a LOT of negative camber in the rear... I
    ran three degrees of negative camber until I eventually got
    tired of replacing the 914's rear tires as often as the NSX's.

    Yes; routine rear-camber alignment is performed using those
    shims, and for a car without suspension DAMAGE (usually caused by
    battery acid dripping onto the right-rear suspension, or by
    collisions with curbs, etc.), shims are the proper solution.
