Again, sorry for posting this to the list, but I can't seem to send any
mail to Dave Darling.  Any suggestions?

Their points and condensor set is $10 and their trigger points are $85
and their rebuilt dist is $95, but they've got a 20% discount right now
so it would only be $8, $68, and $76 respectively - not too bad.  And
the rebuilt dist. carries a 30 month warranty.

I just talked to them and other than cleaning them up, inspecting them
and replacing those 3 components and a new 'bushing', that's all they
do.  Maybe I'll just keep mine and stick the new stuff in it myself.  At
least that way I know I've got the right distributor and all.
