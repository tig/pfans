Okay, I sent in a very early model it was on a 72, but did not have the
big idle adjust knob that my 2.0L unit has.  So we have early units
covered, we will need a later unit still, and I may have an L-jet unit as
soon as I get done with this PEFI install.

I have had the great displeasure of working on the repair of a factory
EFI tester.  Once I had it open, I figured a good digital or analog ohm
meter has a better chance of testing than this unit does.  Well it is now
with a fellow list member, and it is working, have not heard otherwise. 
Interesting piece of equipment, and is useful, but get an Ohm/volt meter
and rig the test to fire the injectors.  Or a decent oscilloscope and
figure out injector pulse widths and the like, besides voltages.

Take care,
Stephen Jacobs
