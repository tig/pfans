A pair of downdraft carburetors will flow much better than the stock runner
and plenum thingy that came with the car. What's your point? We're stuck
with the heads, might as well improve flow wherever we can.

I'll agree that the stock cam profile and ignition advance curve were
designed for the fuel injection, but that doesn't mean things can't be
improved upon. My experience with my 2002 showed me that going from a 2
barrel progressive carb to a 2 barrel synchronous one made a huge
difference, as did porting the intake manifold. Nothing else was changed. I
then changed to a mechanical advance distrubutor and pertronix points
replacement and things got even better. This is with a 320i (injected) long
block with low compression (8.3:1) and stock cam.

My beef with injection is: no detailed documentation, not tunable,
expensive parts, and NLA parts. It seems to me that the #1 problem people
have on this list is with the fuel injection. I understand weber carbs, and
I want parts on my car that I understand. Sure, I have read the patents on
Djet injection. It don't mean beans without a detailed schematic, though. I
mean a detailed schematic of the ecu box.

Everyone has reasons for doing what they want to do. Those are mine.
