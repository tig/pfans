I know everyone seems to have trouble with tuning carbs...Weber &
Dellitiro(sp) alike.
Just my $.02 on this from experience...BTDT
1. If you want a smooth running very economical Pcar leave the FI on and
replace every hose and gasket associated with the FI intake system...and I
mean every thing...gaskets at head under the intake runners....large hose
on runners and at the same time all of the fuel hose with the newer smooth
high pressure type....(this stops the fire problems...will only need your
extinguisher for the guy starting a grass fire with his CAT
converter).....all of the hose is readily available at the mail order parts
places...get the good German type....it will not set you back much $$
either..and in the long run everything runs great. Really, if you haven't
replaced all this your living with a time bomb and your going to need more
than an extinguisher...like $$$$$$$. It can be done with the engine in the
car...yes really...much easier with it out but take the engine lid off and
have at it....say your not a great mechanic...well you can do it!!! just
take your time and take notes..pictures...etc. You will be amazed at how
well the engine runs and all of those mystery problems.
2. Now if you want power, noise, less economy, etc. Go the carb
route....This is not to say this is bad..you just have to understand the
trade offs. The only real problem with the carbs is it takes time to tune
properly. But once done it makes a very responsive 914. No it isn't a 911
or anything like snap your neck stuff but carb a Type 4 and you will get
more HP(at the cost of all that stuff you already know). It just plane
opens up the intake...more air/fuel...etc. You of course have to change the
distributor...I like the 050 over the 009 since it has 30 deg total advance
as it comes.
But either are OK...the real thing is to get an air flow meter...this is a
MUST to good carb tuning!!!!! the best is the type that has a rubber cone
that fits down into the venturi. Sorry I'm not at home and can't look at
the meter to give you a product name but the parts houses have it.....it's
not cheap but well worth the cost....if you have carbs..to set the carbs
you also have to have no air leaks...good gaskets!!!. You then take the air
flow meter and and check the air flow of each venturi(hole/bore/etc.) in
the carb...two per carb...each venturi has an air correction adjustment
screw...check your carb documents for location....adjust all of them to the
the same number on the flow meter by turning the screws all the way in an
find the one that is flowing the most....adjust all others to that
one.....then if your have a CO/2 meter you can go to the idle volume
screw..not the one for the butterflies...and start adjusting each one of
these.....with a CO/2 meter it is easier...can get one from JC Whitney for
less tha $100 which has a tach built in...this is a Gunnerson unit....Or
you can do this part by ear....really....just turn the idle volume screw in
until the engine starts to die and the out to where it starts to run too
rich...the right spot is some where in between....then go to the next one
and do the same...yes it takes time...but you wanted or inherited carbs
right.....they will run great..really...this assumes the ignition is in
good working order.....on the cold start thing...yes unless you hookup the
cold start choke, which the Webers have...don't know about the
Dell's......then you have to let the engine warm up.....as the old book on
"How To Keep Your VW Running For Ever" author???? said roll a cigarette or
drink your coffee...(really was a joint...60s ya know)....really only takes
one minute or less...and all the oil is running around to make things work
right....
Both of these processes have made our 914s run well and pass smog
test...yes in Louisville, KY we have the CA test and have to use RFG
gas(e-ech)
3. The high tech FI route....all questions referred to Joshua Hadler...he
has that one covered.
