Well, it lookslike they are going to start getting more serious about 
emissions testing here. I've heard second hand that tailpipe tests will 
be required of all cars back to 1968 starting in October. I've been so 
pissed off lately about this that I haven't been able to do anything. I 
wrote my elected rep's to get anexplaination, since I had previously 
written them and they said that nothing was changing. Based on this, I 
bought two more old cars. Now I'm really screwed sinced the emissions 
equipment is long since gone and NLA from the manufacturer. The old rule 
was that cars up to 20 years old required a tailpipe test, those up to 25 
required a visual only and over 25 years nobody cared. I don't know what 
I'm going to do yet. I hope I can get some kind of exemption.

Dirk
