Sorry that I didn't reply to the original post.

If I recall, some of the confusion results from the fact that Porsche *did*
at times advertise the original spring rate as 100#.  I forget now my
sources, but I distinctly remember that the *actual* original spring rate
was much lower ( I am remembering in the 70 - 80# range).

For any racers trying to compete in a stock class, this can be quite a question.
