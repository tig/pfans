I'm assuming that you forgot to put one of the front pieces back in,
right?  If it's one of the back pieces, you should have no trouble
getting it on with the pistons, cylinders, and heads re-assembled.  If
it's the front piece, then don't worry, I did the same thing.  It's a
little work, but you can just take the fan housing off to get the front
pieces on.  There isn't another way, unless you want to pull the heads
and cylinders again.  I would definitely recommend putting all sheet
metal back on, and making sure that any holes are sealed as well as you
can get them.  The quantity of air flowing around the cylinders is a
very important part of not only keeping the engine cool, but getting any
sort of longevity out of it.  The PO of my car completely removed the
bellows and cable (the accordion-type thermostat), and for the last two
years I've been running full-open.  I haven't noticed any problems, but
once again, it was put there for a good reason, so if you can get it
fixed, I'd do so.  Good to hear about your rings - I'm suffering the
same smoking problem after I changed my rings, so with any luck mine
will follow suit.

Hope this helps,
