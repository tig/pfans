Hey All,

	I just thought I'd spout this little rant. I just opened up my issue of
European Car today and when I got to the back, I discovered a 16 page
paid advertisement for the National Shooting Sports Foudation. 

WHAT THE F***!

Just because the add has a couple of good 'ol boy NASCAR drivers who
shoot guns is, IMHO, no reason whatsoever to advertise guns in a car
magazine. This was way beyond a paid advertisement. This was a minature
magazine. ABSOLUTELY OFFENSIVE! When I pay money for a car mag, I want
to read about old ferraris, hopped up VWs, historic MGs and restored
Porsches. I DON'T want to see adds for Ruger, Browning and Smith &
Wesson. Anybody else here feel this way? I did make sure that they knew
my dissatisfaction...

ob P-car content: I talked to one of the editors, and they said that the
Project 914 is going to have quite few more installments in the next
year, so keep your eyes peeled.

Also, there was an interesting article in the tech section about fitting
a line lock to 914 rear brakes when the rear calipers get upgraded to
something bigger. Hmm, anyone try this? Certainly not for a street car,
but maybe a nice thing for parking your race car on a trailer or in the
garrage...
