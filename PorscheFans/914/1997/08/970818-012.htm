  I am not certain, of course, but this sounds like a classic case of
water in the brake fluid.  When the system is cold, everything works
fine.  When things heat up, the water in the fluid comes out as
steam, which is a gas, which is compressable, hence, no pedal.  Also,
the expanding steam will push fluid out of the reservoir as it tries
to escape.  When the system cools off, the steam remaining in the
system condenses back into water, which is non-compressable, so good
pedal feel returns.

  Probable causes:  

1.  Water intrusion into the master cylinder reservoir due to leaks
while washing the car, rain, etc.
2.  Contaminated brake fluid (old fuid, or fluid stored stored in an
unsealed or partially full container) used to bleed or top off the
system.
3.  Fluid contaminated in situ; i.e. old fluid in system that has
absorbed water over time.   Remember, brake fluid is very
hygroscopic, that is, it will pull water right out of the air.   This
can be a real problem if you live in a humid climate; when I lived in
Santa Barbara, every brake job I did required wheel cylinder
replacement; I have seen rust pits from standing water in the wheel
cylinders  that were 1/8" deep.

 The solution: Flush the system with plenty of clean new fluid.  Josh
Hadler says I use too much, but I suggest a litre per wheel... that
should get the water out.

					Good Luck,
                                                            Jim T.
