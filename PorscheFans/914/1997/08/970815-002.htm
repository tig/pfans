It came with sway bars. Make him put them on.

Tell him to call you when he gets the battery tray fixed. I hate it when
sellers do this. "Oh I was planning on fixing it." He wants you to buy it
"as is." Subtract the cost of the repair from the asking price.

That subtracts from the value of the car because the front trunk floor had
to be cut up to install the AC. Do you want AC? Otherwise, subtract from the
asking price.

Structurally, there is no difference between '74 and '73 except the bumpers.
Did the car have the big rubber blocks (2 per bumper)? The difference is in
options. The '73 came with all the good stuff, the '74 did not.
