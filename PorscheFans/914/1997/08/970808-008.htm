Thanks to all who responded to my decel popping problem.  Since I got so
many responses telling me it was an exhaust leak, I checked that first.
Everything was as tight as it should be and no faint exhaust leak noises
(I've had those before).

It turns out that Josh was right on the money.  My air adjust screws were
in a little too far, and causing a VERY rich overrun condition.  Problem
solved and the car starts, idles and runs like it never has before.  At the
end of the repair session, the guy who helped (my chief competition in AP)
and I went out for a test drive.  To my surprise, he admitted the car felt
like it had more power than his!  Of course he could be trying to throw me
off...  :)

Again, thanks for all of the advise.

Dion
