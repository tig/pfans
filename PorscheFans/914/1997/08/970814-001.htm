And the only way is to ask questions. Welcome!

Practice is good, but it can become expensive. Let's see what you got...

> 1. I need a manual bad! Where can I get the best?

Two choices really. Factory workshop manual, about $350-$400 for a full
set. Haynes, about $10-20 depending opn who you buy it from. The Haynes
will cover all models.

Easy, it's a cheap part available from most any P-car supply house.
Automotion, GPR, Performance Products, High Performance House,
Automobile Atalanta, Otto's, all of which are very well stocked parts
houses for us orphan P-car lovers.

Safe? depends on what you're doing. Going to and from work, maybe.
Depends on how bad it really is. But alot of 914s suffer this. Racing or
aggressive driving, I'd say no way. Either way, you're really up the
creek on this one. This is a VERY expensive repair, and can potentially
cost well into the thousands. I'm sorry you got stuck with this car, but
lessons learned and all that...

Could be alot of things. Read the P-fans archives and get a Haynes
manual. It'd take too long to go over all of the possible causes of a
hot-stall.

That's for the heater. The fan turns on when you pull the heat lever all
the way up, and forces additional air into the heat exchangers. Melt
your toes and freeze your nose... :)

Duuhhh, uhm any 1.8 guys want to comment on this? I havn't a clue...

Hmm, never pulled the sender out of the tank before, but it sounds like
it's stuck. Yes, it can be pulled, I just never had the need before. If
you feel inclined to do it, let us all know how it turns out.

Get the Haynes, but there should also be one in the owners manual, and
also on the fuse cover. I'm going to now assume that you don't have
either of them? Bummer...

The Odometer isn't unhooked, it's broken. If the speedo works and the
odo doesn't, it's broke. The odometer runs off the speedo cable.

Some of "veterans" really like to see new converts to the faith. So
don't hesitate to ask. We just might not get back to you promptly
though, some of us may be too busy fixing or racing our cars to check
our e-mail. :) 

Like me, next week is all autoxing! The biggest autox event of the
nation all year and it's right here in Denver! Although, I won't be
driving _my_ car at all of the events. Sorry folks, but I have an offer
to drive a KILLER RX-7, and all I have to do is provide lodging to the
owner. So what would you do? Drive an underdeveloped, underpowered car
in an incredibly competetive national event, or drive someone elses very
thoroughly prepared 200hp RX-7 (the very same car that kicked my butt
for two years in the bay area) and still collect points for the same
class. You do the math... Me, I'm gonna do the drivin'! 
YEEEHAAAA!
