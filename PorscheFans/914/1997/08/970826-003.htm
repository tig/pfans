That all depends on what class you intend on entering. SoloII rules wrt
induction/fuel/ignition: Stock - not allowed. Street Prepared -
unrestricted (no turbos where none previously existed though). Prepared
- restricted but not unallowed. Aftermarket FI (or any modification to
stock FI) will incur a 10% weight penalty. Carbs are specifically
designated and may be used without penalty. Modified - how much money ya
got?

I plan on going the Accel/DFI route for my CSP 914. As a matter of fact,
I just discovered that Vellios makes a dual throttle body set up for
4-banger P-cars. It's designed to mate to any dual IDF manifold. Already
setup with injector ports and buterfly valves. They are 48mm bodies
which may be just a bit large for a stock engine, but the advantage with
injection is that alot of that can be compensated for. Stock throttle
body for D-jet is 45mm so I figure another 3mm is not unheard of. And
the best part, they're only $300/side! They don't come with sensors, but
that shouldn't be too big a deal. And they can accomodate just about any
pulsed injector (no CIS).
