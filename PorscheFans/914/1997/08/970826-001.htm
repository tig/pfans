I'm talking about preferring webers to the stock Djet, not to a high tech
programmable fuel injection. My discussion has been limited to only those
two choices. If I had a laptop computer, if I had lots of money, and if I
had a dyno, then a programmable fuel injection would be great. But that's
not my situation and I'm not interested in talking in the abstract about
carbs vs. fuel injection. My situation is simply do I keep the troublesome
and ancient and mysterious Djet, or do I use the simpler, more reliable and
known webers? I have a street-only car, and I work on it myself. I have
limited money, so I'm not interested in having to replace 300$ MPS's and
other expensive parts. Besides, have you seen all those early carbureted
911's and 914/6's converting over to fuel injection in droves? No, they keep
thier webers.
