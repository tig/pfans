Yeah, my own story started with the accelerator cable. I removed the pedal
cluster board...boy, it looks crusty down there...better rebuild the pedal
cluster...man that floor is rusty, better paint it...sh*t, the master
cylinder is leaking, gotta get that 19mm jobbie...sh*t, the brake fluid
supply hoses won't come off the master cylinder...I'll just pull the whole
works down through...d*mn, now I have to pull the gas tank to put the
tubing back...yuk, look at all those mouse turds...and the gas tank well is
rusty as hell...and the gas tank don't look so good either, better repaint
and seal it...and what about this cheap plastic fuel line?...and on and on
and on....
