Well, it seems that worn out but OK-looking trigger points will cause a
D-jet FI system to run WAYYY rich.  I replaced the trigger points and
magically, all the over-rich-gas-smoke crap just disappeared.  (OK, OK,
I know a lot of you guys told me this, but I always know better because
its my car, right?)

So anyway, I'm driving the car again, but still have a few minor
problems to work out.  Today, for some reason, it decided to start
idling at 2200 instead of 1000 where it was yesterday.  I haven't had a
chance to look at it yet, but sounds like either the aux air valve quit
or else a vacuum line came loose somewhere.

Another very annoying problem is the throttle cable itself.  It seems
real 'sticky' coming off of idle, causing me to give it too much gas
starting off (I went to back out of a parking spot at a convenience
store and lit up both rear tires - very embarrasing) - also makes
driving in stop-and-go traffic an adventure.  I'll replace my old cable
tonight and hopefully that will take care of it.

The third thing I am concerned with is the decel valve.  Maybe I'm just
not used to it yet (dual Webers decel VERY quickly when you lift off the
gas), but I almost feel like I'm driving an automatic!  I'll leave this
problem untill last as any other vacuum leak or high-idle problem would
exagerate this one.  I'll try blocking off the hoses as suggested in
Nelin's procedures and see what happens.

On the GOOD SIDE:  The car is VERY quiet!  I can actually carry on a
normal conversation under full throttle instead of having to scream at
the top of my lungs - very nice.  Also, while the car seems to be a
little bit slower at low rpms (like 1500 - 2500), it more than makes up
for it at higher speeds.  Much to my wife's chagrin, I ran it up to 5300
in 5th yesterday afternoon - no sweat (well, OK it was 100 degrees with
a heat index of 109 so I was sweating my ass off and when I casually
told my wife we were doing about 120, she started sweating profusely).

If any of the rest of you guys are interested in re-installing FI, talk
to me!  I'm sold on the notion (even though I enjoyed my carbs and feel
like I had them set up quite well) and can fill you in on what's
involved in the conversion.

Thanks again to all those who have helped me through my time of need.
I'll post again after I've got the rest of the bugs worked out.
