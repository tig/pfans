I looked at a 914 2.0 this last weekend.  It was in very nice condition. 
The owner also had another 2.0 that was a little more rough, and TWO
914-6s, one original and one a conversion with a Turbo 3.6 out of a 94 911
I believe (the single large turbo variety).  Can you say fast?  Wait... Can
you say downright SCARY!  Anyways...  back to the 2.0.

He advertised it as a '73 2.0 and indeed the build date was 10-73.  However
the first 3 numbers of the VIN were 474 which makes it a '74 correct?  

The car did not have the swaybars on it although it did appear to have had
them (holes through the fender well for the bars).  It did have the 2.0
alloys in very nice shape ( a little waterspot here and there).  It had the
three gauges on the console, which if I understand came with the 2.0s?  

What were the differences between the '73 2.0s and the '74s?  

Did all 2.0s come with sway bars?  

I looked all over for rust and there is very little mostly confined to the
battery tray itself, which he said he would replace.  He is building a new
engine for it (stock), this one and the engine that's in it comes with the
car (read: 1 fresh 2.0, one with 80K mi but running). 

Oh and the car used to have Air Conditioning.  The compressor has been
removed, but he will give me that too.

The interior is in good condition as well as the dash and both trunks.

The exterior was painted in '92.  He is the second owner and has receipts
from 1976 (oil changes and Valve adjustments).

He is asking $4000 for the car.  I thought this was a good deal til I saw
the 474 in the VIN and no sway-bars.  I am going to autocross this car in
SCCA Solo2 (competitively or not) as well as drive it daily.

What should I offer?  Should I offer or wait for another to come around? 
All the other 2.0s I've looked at either had trashed interiors, or dinged
and questionable bodies and they were all in $3900 to $5000 price range.

Thank in advance for any advice.
