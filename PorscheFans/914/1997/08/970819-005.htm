But remember -- this comparison has nothing to do with actual speed.

Originally, the 914 came with 185/70 or some similar tall skinny tires (I'm
not in my garage right now, but it's listed on a plate in the front trunk).

The smaller diameter of the tires most 914er's run now cause the speedo to
read incorrect actual speed.

For example, running street Goodyear 205/60's, my speedo reads approx 10 mph
higher than actual highway speeds.

I haven't gotten around to it yet (also since I keep changing tire sizes),
but I'm sure the speedo can be recalibrated.

Best Regards,
