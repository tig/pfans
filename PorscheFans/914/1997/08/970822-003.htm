Another option for a sub woofer is under the dash.  I took 4) 5 1/4"
woofers and put them in a sealed box.  The box is 12x12x4 and fits under
my dash don't have a console).  It sounds pretty good with a 100w/ch
(into 4 ohm) amp into the woofers in pairs to show the amp 2 ohms.  This
means that the speakers are seeing almost 180w a pair.
A box that small is very inefficient but with that much power works.  If
you are looking for just a little bass reinforcement you could even try
2 woofers in a 6x12x4" box. Or if you have a console (I have one coming
for mine) you might be able to reinforce it for a base box.  Will let
ya'all know how that goes if I do it.
Though I have a feeling there is a problem with that or more people
would have done it.
