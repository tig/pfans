All- Thanks you for all your help. I am a new owner who has apparently been
dealt a badly rusted '72 1.7L car. I'm dealing with it.

Jim T. told me that if I fixed my gas gauge problem, that I should post the
repair to this list as he had never seen a description of that repair here.
So here goes:

Problem: Gas gauge reads about 2/4 (1/2) all the time no matter how much
gas is in the car, but meter movement moves to empty when key turned off
like it should.

Repair: Since gauge moved to empty when car shut off, I eliminated the
gauge itself as the culprit. Removed the sender. To get to the sender,
remove filler (8 bolts), remove expansion tank (2 bolts), then remove
sender (5 or 6 bolts?). Remove nut and washer on bottom of sender and slide
the tube off (carefully- there are some thin wires that could get broken).
The sender is a fancy potentiometer, which sends different levels of
resistance to the gauge depending on the level of the float, which
completes the circuit. My float contacts must have been stuck to the two
silver resistive wires it travels on, and came free very easily. I VERY
carefully cleaned the two resistive wires with an abrasive cloth similar to
ScotchBrite, and reinstalled. That's the fix. Gas gauge works great now.

Jim described a problem where his gauge reads OK (kinda), but only between
1/4 and 3/4. I would guess his resistive wires need more cleaning on the
first and last quarters of the wires than in the middle half.
