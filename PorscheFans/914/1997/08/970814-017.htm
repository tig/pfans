Don't be too hard on the sporting gun people, for they are under attack by
the same 
crowd that wants you too stop driving that *poluting* 914.  Anyways, you
brought up their "Project Cars" - have you seen the 911 they bought for a
project car?
It has some bastardized slope nose kit on it that looks pathetic.  Oh well, I
like the magazine better when it was called "VW & Porsche" those were the
good old days.
