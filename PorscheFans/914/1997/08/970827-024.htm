I have the o-scope, a dandy pulse generator and 12V power supply. Anyone
know the specs on the sensors for a '73 D-jet or a '74 L-jet? Guess I could
go out and measure them - thought someone might know know off the top of
their head.

Here's something I ran into while trying to troubleshoot a starting problem
on the '73 D-jet... Turned on the ignition switch but did not crank the
starter. Rotated the throttle to activate the throttle switch. Only 2
injectors firing. Swapped injectors, checked wiring continuity, checked
fuel pump, checked fuel lines, swapped ecu boxes. Same thing. No mention of
only 2 injectors firing during starting in any literature I can find. I
guess they are supposed to work that way (prevent flooding, maybe?), but I
wasted days chasing down what I supposed to be a problem.
