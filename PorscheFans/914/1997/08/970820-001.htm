Last Friday a.m. getting ready to go up to Road America to work the CART
race I loaded my '76 914, started the car and turned on the headlights as
it was raining like hell.  As usual I hit the dimmer stalk to make sure my
brights were working.  Well, no brights so I clicked the stalk a couple of
times and all of a sudden the headlights popped down.  Checked the
headlight motor fuse which was blown.  Figured no big deal so put in
another fuse and as soon as it made contact it fried, put in another and
same deal.  So I left it in the garage and took the trusty Olds up to the
track.  Yesterday I went to start it and nothing.  Voltage at battgery
terminals was 9.6.  Put the charger on it for half an hour and got it up to
12 v. and it fired right up.  I manually raised the headlights and now have
both low and high beams so I don't know what the problem is.  BTW, I have
Hella H-4s with, I believe, 50 watt bulbs and no headlight relay.  Any
suggestions/solutions would be greatly appreciated.
