If you were to do this on the hottest day of the year in your area this
might be, *might be* o.k. advice, however I would never mount an amp in
this fashion(without at least 2 fans in a push-pull configuration.)
Ambient temperature in a trunk on a hot day *by itself* can reach 130+
degrees.

IMHO if you care about your equipment, and it is possible to mount it
*any* other way, do so. If you absolutely have no other choice use at
least 2 fans in a push-pull configuration. I don't know about you, but
shortening the life of expensive equipment if it is at all possible just
doesn't make sense. Electronic circuitry does not like heat.

There isn't much circulation going on in a trunk. You do have a greater
volume of air, however if you mount an amp in this fashion all that hot
air is getting "circulated" right back up to that amp. If I had an
installer suggest I mount an amp in this fashion, I would find another
installer.
