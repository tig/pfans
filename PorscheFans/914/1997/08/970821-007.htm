Hi all!
I was poking around the stereo pages on Brian Ng's web page
and came across the pictures of his fiberglass woofer enclosure.
It goes in the passenger footwell where the polygonal foam piece is.
Well, I peeled my carpet back and removed the foam and saw what 
looks like a speedo/odometer mechanism or transmission of some 
sort.  Brian's 914 is a 1973 and does not have this thingy.  His 
enclosure was fashioned after the 73 footwell.  My question (finally)
is this, what exactly is this thingy and can I relocate it so that my
75 914 footwell can accomodate Brian's woofer box?  I didn't have 
time to trace the 'cables' from the mechanism and find out where they
origiate (It's an even longer story).  =8^|

75 914 2.0 (for now...)
