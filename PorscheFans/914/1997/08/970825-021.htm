Nah, more like MoTec or Accel at this point. :) But yeah, a _modern_ FI
system regardless. D-jet (or L-jet for that matter) are bearskins and
stone knives compared to even a modern Bosch FI system, much less the
hot-stuff programble FI systems that I'm considering for my car.

That's what I was refering to as well. Sure, there are vast differences
in FI systems. But there's also vast diferences in carbs as well.

With a stock cam (the one the original FI system was designed with) I
don't think carbs present any advantage (power wise) over D-jet.

Well said DD. Too many people think that carbs (big or small), or
aftermarket FI for that matter, are simply bolt-on performance
enhancements. Very rarely is this actually the case. And most of the
time they require significant tuning to achieve performance gains. What
is neccessary is to adapt or tune your new induction system to the
existing engine. Now in the case of Webers, there have been so many 914s
that have converted over that there is a significant resource of
knowlegde and parts available. In addition, because carbs are "low-tech"
in comparison to fully programable FI systems, they require fewer
support components. They are not popular because they are better, but
they are a know quantity and have predicatable, if not reliable, failure
modes. Not unlike the D-jet or L-jet FI.

The reason why I want to go to aftermarket FI? I have been researching
ways to get significant power enhancements out of a stock
low-compression engine. And the way that is done is with a programable
system that you can map the ignition and fuel to the engine's profile.
Pump alot more fuel in at the right time and advance the ignition in the
right places, and you can significantly fatten the existing torque and
power curves. Because the cam has not actually changed, the power band
width and rpms will not really change.

Carbs have their place too. I don't completely knock carbs, well ok, I
do. But the thing is, carbs are a very known quantity to many people and
mechanics and as a result can be easier for some people to deal with.
I'm an FI guy, so my bias is towards FI and away from carbs, but you all
know that by now anyway. :)

Bingo!

Unless you want to race in a class where carbs are all you're allowed.
And there's alot of classes like that.
 
Just my $.20
