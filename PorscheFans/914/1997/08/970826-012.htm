Hi Dave!  My server still doesn't like your server and I can't e-mail
directly to you.

Thanks for the offer, but I fixed mine by applying some JB-Weld to the
top of the hole then squeezing the 'punched' tab of metal back flush
with the box and allowing to dry overnight - looks like a permanent fix.

Take care.

To: 914@PorscheFans.com

After almost 9 months of searching, I think I've found a 914  to be used for PCA 
club racing.  I've found a '75 2.0L with FI, in good shape.  Minimal rust, very 
stiff, and it shifts better than my 911.  I know I should have bought a '73, but 
finding one up here in the frozen north is tough.

A few basic questions:
1.  How hard will it be to swap the big ugly bumper covers for something lighter 
(and less ugly)?
2.  Any thoughts on the exhaust system.  It will only be driven in the summer, 
so heat is not a consideration.  Any problems with the FI if I go to a 4 into 1 
header and muffler?
3.  What else should I do to bring the car up to the level of a '73 (not 
including suspension work which I would have done anyway)?
4.  Where is a good source for rocker covers?  The ones on this car need to be 
replaced.

There will be lots of additional questions as I really get into the project.

Thanks,

Jim Andrews
