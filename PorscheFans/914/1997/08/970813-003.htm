Well, I finally got my fuel pressure gauge - it looks really cool in
there!

And as suspected, when my motor quits running, the pressure has just
started dropping, then drops to 0.  After it sits for a while, I can get
pressure again.

So I'm doing several things.  One of which is to relocate my pump to the
front of the car (like the '75 and '76 models).  I can figure out the
hoses and where to locate the pump OK, but any suggestions on how to
hook up the electrical?  I'd like to wire it in so it still operates the
same which means I've got to splice into the wiring harness and run
wires to the front from the original connector.

Any ideas how best to route the wires???

Thanks

this is my home one and I don't use it very often.
