Sorry to post this to the list, but my replies to D.D. keep getting
returned undeliverable.

Wow!  You'd think you've done this before or something.  (BTW, your
diagram and Nelin's text are the 2 things that have gotten me this far -
thanks for taking the time to post that.)

Tonight I'll be checking for leaks at the head/manifold, manifold/air
box, and air box/throttle body and really expect to find some.  You'd
think that after fighting head/manifold leaks for 2 years with my Webers
I'd know better than to try bolting these up without any 'pookie' on
them.

I installed the old injectors (original? - all the numbers on the green
plastic elect. connector match) with their old boots.  They all fit
tightly in place and don't pivot or move.  I'll be placing an order to
get new injector boots and runner boots soon, but wanted to try to see
what else I'll need first.

There is a possibility I've got an air leak where the branch/elbow
(where the breather hose attaches) connects to the air box.  I'll be
putting a hose clamp on that one tonight.  Other than that, I'm pretty
sure I've got good connections on the rest of the hoses.

One concern that just occurred to me is the Aux. Air valve.  When I
tested it last week, it didn't close so I slapped it with a wrench and
then it worked.  I let it cool and it opened, then powered it up again
and it closed, but maybe between then and now it has started sticking
again.  If it remained open, it would contribute to high idle also,
right?  And the hoses for it do run from the air filter housing to the
valve then to the big plastic block between the coldstart valve and the
air box, right?

Unfortunately, my pressure gauge only goes up to 10psi for fuel - not
too usefull on an FI car.  I ordered a VDO 1 1/2" gauge that I will
mount permanently in the engine compartment, but it won't be here until
Thursday (assuming Fed X can deal with the massive overflow from the UPS
strike).  In the mean time, I don't really have any way to check my fuel
pressure.  You might say its kind of stupid trying to sort everything
out when I can't even test this important feature, but I never claimed I
wasn't a little (lot?) stupid.  But I'm very new to this FI stuff and
the only way I know to learn is to install it and start checking/testing
every last thing on it.  That way, the next time I have trouble with it,
I'll know how each piece effects the whole system.

I checked my temp sensor II (head temp) and cold was only 1200 ohms.
Even though Nelin's text said it should be 2000-3000, I figured, "What
the hey?  Resistance is resistance and 1200 seems like a lot."  Based on
what you said about lower = leaner, I think I'll be replacing that one
tonight!

Mine is still sealed and is the original from my car (been boxed for the
last 15 years along with the rest of the FI) so I'm hoping it is
adjusted OK.  The resistance between the 2 sets of terminals was 90 and
355 (vs the 90 and 350 stated by Nelin) so I think it is OK.

Yes, mine are green.  I checked them for electrical and mechanical
operation, but haven't checked the flow/pattern.  (I was euphemistically
hoping that I'd just stick everything on and it would run great.)  After
I track down the other obvious problems, I'll test them

>	OK, I think I've run down here.  Good luck, and congrats for
coming
>back into the FI'd world!

I did several 0-60 mph runs last week before removing my Weber 44 IDFs
and will repeat the test after I've got the FI working right - should be
interesting to see some definitive numbers between the two setups.  One
thing I can tell you for certain is that even though its not running
right yet, it is already infinitely quieter than the dual Webers, even
with the air filter off it is MUCH quieter (Yeah!!!!!)

Thanks for the help and the time to share it.  I'll post to the list
tomorrow with my progress/status (and probably some more questions).

Take care.
