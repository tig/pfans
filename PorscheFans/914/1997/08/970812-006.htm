Sure you have options, take out the old and pick up a set of Hella or
Cibie H4s from one of the many catalog companies, any 7" round will work.
 Buy an extra H4 bulb and you and stow it in the glove box.

I have used both Cibie and Hella, I prefer my Cibies, but they are darn
expensive compared to the Hella's which are now DOT legal.  You will want
this, every now and again you can run into police trouble if you run none
DOT lights.  Also means any local mechanic can aim them since they have
the little nubs to support the aiming instrument.  I got my aiming unit
from Meijer for $11.99 works great.

The difference in lighting is not the actual wattage, but the focal
points of the lenses, and the lenses design.  You get what you pay for,
and no way will a $12.99 Halogen sealed beam beat a H4 light with a
proper design.  The difference is phenomenal, you can see.  If you want
more check out Brian Ngs web page, (Brian I need your URL), he has a
diode setup that works wonders.  Thanks Brian!!!!  So simple I passed up
the idea several times in my head.

Ottos sells a kit that converts these to an H1 light and will let you
pick bulb wattage.  The big disadvantaged here is that you are stuck with
the original factory reflector and lenses design, which was set up as a
fog light.  If you are looking for a driving light a fog light lenses
will not do, completely different focal design.  So if you want driving
lights go pick them up.  The Europe lights are nice, there are some new
generic types out there in catalogs, AA will have one soon.  Some careful
measurements and you may find one that fits.  I have a set of Cibie
driving lights that are a perfect fit, but allas the part number is long
gone.

Once you have upgraded lights, you can also pickup higher wattage bulbs
if you wish, but this will make your lighting illegal for street use.

Yes I can turn on up to 440 watts of light off the front of my 914, but
never do.  Man you can severely blind someone with these things. And
drain all capability out of your battery.  But it does allow me to keep
the rumors of UFO activity alive and well at hanger 18 at Wright Patt Air
Force Base.  

Did you see that!  Why Yes I did, another Low Flying UFO with Elvis
driving.  It is interesting how all that powder sugar flies out the targa
top and litters the poor guy behind you with a Powdered sugar smoke
screen.  And boy look at the mess a jelly filled does to his side winder.

James Bond stuff, nah, just some one who spent another 11 hours working
on his 914 last night!  Got to get to the Auto-x this weekend, I got a
need for some high G turns. :-)

Take care,
