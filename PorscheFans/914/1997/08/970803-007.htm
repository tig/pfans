Josh,

The other day during some high spirited driving (and high RPM driving), 
I got home and did the same, popped the engine lid only to find oil sprayed
all
over the top.  Luckily, my problem was quickly discovered and minor; the
dipstick
had popped up about 1/4" and was spraying oil at high RPM's.

I hope this helps, and good luck with your problem.

Dion
