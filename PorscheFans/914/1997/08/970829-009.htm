     Hi Larry,
     
        The boys at Nascar.com and related links can guide you through the 
     massive Chevy aftermarket to find the engine management and telemetry 
     equipment.  Since at this point, you haven't been specific about which 
     engine you wish to install into your 914, may I suggest the new C-5 
     Corvette?  At aprox. 345 HP for 349 C.I., and excellent efficiency, 
     you can't start at a better place.  Some of the folks at the Renegade 
     914 Owners Club have done V-8 conversions and have comments posted in 
     the "Conversion" and "Modification" bulletin boards.
        I was tempted to do the same in my 914 for the street.  I contacted 
     Rod Simpson Hybrids and got his info.  The long and short of it is 
     that the 901 Transaxle becomes a big liability with the torque 
     available in American V-8's.  A switch over to a 915 (better yet, a 
     Turbo 4-speed) seems mandatory.  Chassis stiffening, substantially 
     more powerful brakes, and lots of tire under the wheel wells are also 
     "mandatories". 
        While I've never driven one, I've seen 4 V-8 converts, 1 up close.  
     The last had a Very Clean late model LT-1 with polished intake 
     manifold and beautifully detailed engine compartment.  A really cool 
     one I saw had the 916 look, totally dechromed and all white with 
     flares.  The wheels (16" Fuchs) were painted to match with polished 
     rims....very sharp.  Another ragged looking one was driven by a guy 
     who wanted to drag race me one day when I was driving my Mustang GT.  
     Needless to say, not only did I not indulge him, I realized how 
     "wrong" his car sounded when he punched it and his exhaust began to 
     spew lots of unburned gas (and probably oil) out the rear.  That was 
     the one stick-point that I could not personally get over, ..... the 
     SOUND.  While 914's and 914/6's are not necessarily known for their 
     "SOUND", an American V-8 (and any car so equipped) is definitely 
     distinctly identifiable by this.  I could get EXTREMELY excited about 
     owning a GT-40 replica, or Pantera, or any other faily large 
     mid-engined American V-8 equipped car...the two would complement each 
     others' aesthetics very well.  But a 914 V-8 just doesn't do it for 
     me.
        It does however sound like a really ass-kicking fun project.  Lots 
     of engineering will need to go into in to do it safe and do it 
     "right".  This challenge would definitely be fun.  I wish you well.  
     Let me know if you need any more info.  I've stacked up lots of info 
     on this conversion as well as other possibilities i.e supercharged VW 
     Wasserboxer, Hi-Po TYPE IV, Pauter 3.0 4cylinder, and VW 4-Valve GTI 
     conversions.  I did however find a killer deal on an '83 911SC engine 
     with low miles that I couln't pass up.
     
     Good Luck
     
     Brian
