I am replying to Larry with copy to the group for the general info.

I started this project last year, but have not been able to test it

enough, because the my '73 with hiperf 2.1 engine spends most of its

time 400 miles away from home and my Djet tester and workbench.

I hope to get the car back from my son in the near future.

About two years ago I bought an S&S exhaust with muffler from Euro Parts

in Torrance, Calif.  It didn't fit, so I took it back to S&S in Anaheim

for modification.  Their jig was built wrong, so they fixed it.  Since
that time, S&S has disappeared from this area code, so I don't know if
they are still in business.  At any rate, the unit bolted four tubes
onto the stock heat exchangers and wrapped them around to the right and
joining into a triangular flange so familiar to late 914 and VW van
exhausts.  Their muffler bolted right onto that flange.  



My plan is to substitute an '81 VW Vanagon or Porsche 924 CAT for the

muffler.  Both units have the triangular flange on both ends, the Vangon
unit being almost an inch longer.  I have used both on my '76 914 2.0. 
I have temporarily run just a CAT on that car, and it does just enough
muffling to be acceptable, while providing very low backpressure.



The new CATs are 3 way, and they do a marvelous job of cleaning the

exhaust.  The 924 unit is a direct replacement for the unobtainable 914

unit, but without a port for the temp sensor.  Who cares about that? 


Somebody warned me that running without the smog pump would ruin the

CAT.  My smog pump is operable only at smog test time, and a year of

running without it did not hurt the CAT at all.

Of course, it would be a waste to put a CAT on an engine that is not
running correctly.  

Cheers,
