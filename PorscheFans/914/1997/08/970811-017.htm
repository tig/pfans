Stephen,

Believe it or not, last week I picked up a Pertronix unit from the good ol'
boys at Summit Racing for my little flat four.  I actually find a lot of
stuff there for my car that they don't advertise in their Mustang/Camero-
heaven catalog.  The guys are pretty cool about it too, and are usually as
surprised as I am when they find these things in stock.  Plus they are
located less than ten minutes from my house.

Anyway, I installed the Pertronix unit with NO mods to my 009 distributor.
I kept looking for the 'grinding' portion I've always read about, but the
thing fit in there exactly like it was supposed to.  And like you, I
haven't either had the thing long enough, or couldn't feel any noticeable
difference in the performance of the engine.  But it is nice not worrying
about the points and condensor anymore!

Later,

Dion
