Is there some "law" that dictates how much a mechanic can charge for
diagnosis?  It seems like there's a loop hole where mechanics could say,
"it's going to cost $150 to replace your starter, but it took us 10
hours to find out that was the problem...  So, your new starter will
cost $650."

Thanks,
