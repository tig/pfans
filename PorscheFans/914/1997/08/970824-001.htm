Josh,
I sincerely hope you meant that CARBURATED 914s (four cylinders) were never
available in the US from Porsche.  The Six, of course, had big Webers on
it.  The proposed SB-42 program in California will make things a lot easier
here.

California Gearheads;  Please Support SB-42, write/fax/call your
assemblyman and simply say you are in favor of this bill.

Cheers
Thom Kuby
