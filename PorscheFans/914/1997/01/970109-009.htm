        Shane Garner of the PFans list forwarded an email message from Eric 
Henneke, explaining how Eric's '90 C2 was destroyed after he dropped it off at 
Lipshy Porsche and it was destroyed while being towed to the body shop.  As an 
attorney, I can't help but respond (even though I'm not rendering legal advice, 
since I am not permitted to do so by my firm to anyone but clients - call it a 
friendly opinion).

        Eric, you've been hosed.  First off, you have a clear claim against 
Lipshy for what is called negligent bailment (you certainly would in California,
and I believe negligent bailment exists in all states, although I can't say I'm 
absolutely positive).  All you have to do is prove that you gave the car to 
Lipshy and they didn't give the car back to you in the same condition, and you 
win.  It's Lipshy's obligation/problem to go after the towing company for what 
they would have to pay you.  Now, you can let your insurance company, State 
Farm, handle it and become subrogated to your claim, which means that they will 
stand in your shoes and go after Lipshy for what they pay you, their insured.  
But if State Farm counts it against you in any way, you lose, even though you 
did nothing wrong, and you can tell State Farm to stay out of it, and that you 
will pursue Lipshy for the money.  This may not be practical, but you have the 
right to do this.

        As for your rental car, the attorney you talked to was correct - when 
someone else is at fault, they are obligated to compensate you for loss of use, 
which means pay for you to rent a comparable car, or pay you the difference of 
what that would cost you vs what you actually rented.  Which means you are 
entitled to even more money from Lipshy, since you're in an el cheapo from 
Enterprise.  State Farm is right that they only have to cover you for the amount
stated in your policy, since your claim with State Farm is under your own 
policy.

        Frankly, I don't think you should take this lying down.  Your rights are
about as clear as they can be, and any competent attorney should be able to 
resolve this with Lipshy fairly quickly (since they have no justifiable legal 
position).  That is why they threatened you when you mentioned a lawyer - they 
know that if you get one, they're up the creek, without the proverbial paddle.

        Pretty amazing that they're taking this attitude, since they are 
undoubtedly insured.  Also, they must realize what will happen when you tell 
everyone about the incident.  Oh well - there are people in every line of 
business who behave like this, and it's up to people like you to see that they 
don't get away with it, whether that's by suing their ass or just spreading the 
word.

        Good luck!!
