Thanks to all who've responded thus far.

I've received:
- the alternate address to Stuttgart I needed.
- multiple "911 brick" jokes.
- Dirk's jest (maybe he was serious :-]  ) - to find a hurricane, and set up to
start testing, utilizing a field full of cigarrette smokers all puffing in
unison : - ) .  Almost sounds like the plot to the movie, "Twister," and it
could turn out to be a much better plot.
- some intentional serious responses.

I want to especially want to thank Andrew Warren for his thoughtful responses.
Good food for thought Andrew.  I was thinking of the exact situation you
describe about the roll bar - spoiler.  I can think of a few designs (some of
them even not so obvious, but effective) to incorporate into the fiberglass top
which may help the mentioned low pressure turbulent air spot over the engine.
The other situation I'd like to have conclusive results about is the issue of
hanging a wing on the rear.  WHERE?  What's most effective, truly?  Prove it.
Thanks again, Andrew.  I have opportunity to be in some pretty high-speed
autocrosses, and on to PCA driver ed track events, and maybe even to PCA Club
Racing.  I'm planning ahead, not just looking at what's immediately at hand in
the simplest autocross.

I love the bantering jest, but I'm thankful for the serious too.  

For the rest, keep dropping those bricks, maybe you CAN turn a frog into a
prince [VW Beetle into a 911 : - )  ].  You know what they say in sales - if you
sling enough spaghetti against the wall, some of it's gonna stick.
