Dirk, I would highly recommend using an automotive seam sealer.  It is
formulated to withstand the temperature flucations, vibration, and fumes
associated with automobiles.  Home type sealers are not designed for this
type of environment and will not hold up.  Furthermore, home type sealers
may not be able to be covered with automotive type of paint.  Think things
through and use the right parts and supplies for a good job.  It is better
to do the job right the first time than to have to weld in new metal in a
year because of a previous "quick and dirty" job.

I have just replaced the drivers side floor pan in my 72 914 and used the
3M brand of automotive seam sealer.  This is good stuff.
