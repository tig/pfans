  I'll be going to a swap meet this Sunday so wanted to check this.  The
  spare 73 side shift tranny I have has a broken off mounting horn on the
  rear cover.  I want to look for a replacement cover at the meet.

  Anything I should look for that makes a rear cover unusable?  I recall
  looking at one briefly at a previous meet before I needed one. Was asking
  $50,  I recall it had a rusty looking "idler shaft" (I think that's the
  name.  Large tube shape sticking out from the cover plate in toward the
  tranny).  I don't know much about trannys, got the idler shaft name from
  Haynes 914 manual.  Would this being rusty make it worthless even if
  cleaned up?  If deeply pitted?

  Can the rear cover be changed easily or does it involve special tools or
  knowledge that only someone with tranny rebuilding experience should do?

  Please also copy any reply to the email below so I can check on Sat.

  Thanks,
  Jeff
