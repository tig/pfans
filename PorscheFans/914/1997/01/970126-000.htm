Hi 914-er's!

  I have been reading the mail regarding this spacer/gasket/dohickey 
that supposedly goes in the rear calipers between the caliper halves, 
and all I can say is "Huh?"

  It is my understanding that the 914-6 had different rear brakes  (not 
absolutely sure about that... maybe someone on the list can set me 
straight), and perhaps it is these that have the mystical part.  

  Also, someone mentioned that this part was added to accomodate 
rotors of a non-stock thickness, implying a custom mod.

  It is also possible that different years from my '74 have different rear 
brakes, although I have not heard of this being the case.

  However, I CAN say, unequivocally, that in MY calipers at least, 
THERE AIN'T NO SUCH PART!

				Regards,
				Jim T.
