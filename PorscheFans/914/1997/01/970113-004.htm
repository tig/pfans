OK guys.....Here comes another perspective on the oil coolers.  I live in
Texas and its a necessity to keep these oil cooled 4s and 6s as cool as
possible in the peak summer months.  Especially if they are air conditioned
which many are in this part of the US.  I have participated in mounting
coolers upfront, on the lids and under the trunk.  All locations will work
with the correct combination of coolers and fans.
I have my preferred locations and (sorry, Josh) the engine grill is the last
place I (just my opinion) would suggest to mount the cooler.  My experience
is that it is restrictive (by cooler size alone) of the cooling air designed
to flow through that area, it will eventually cause one of the hinges for the
lid to break, it also requires you to remove the rain pan on the 4s, and
lastly the plumbing for lid mounted coolers can also be somewhat cumbersome.
 The front mounted GT style cooler locations are the most efficient but also
require the most space (in useable front trunk areas) most plumbing and in
turn are the most expensive.  They also require access area, usually taken
out of the front bumpers and valances/spoilers.  On nice 914s the cutting of
perfect chrome bumpers is a shame and alternate locations may be preferrable.
 In applications other than track cars front coolers usually require
thermostats (unless the cooler is small) because of oil viscosity problems
and also because they will almost over cool the oil.  I realize that in
normally warm climates this is not too much of a concern (cool oil temps. <
180 degrees) but in codler areas the external coolers can burst if the oil
hits them and is cold.
The places I would suggest be give serious consideration are in the fender
wells, in front and above the wheels (flares make this a very easy
installation) or under the rear trunks.  Both spaces provide room to mount
coolers of good size with fans and thermostats (if desired).  They are
visually undetectable from the top side of the car and don't impact access to
the engine or the front trunk.  I have seen several articles written over the
years where people have elected not to mount coolers here because of the heat
from exhausts and the engine.  I was curious about this also so I
experimented.  On 914-4s you can install a single or two pass system above
the right axle with fans and it will take oil temp down considerably.  Over
30 degrees in a 914-4 2.0L, air conditioned, daily commuter.  On my 3.0L
914-6 the cooler is mounted on the left side of the trunk.  It is a single
cooler, Earl's brand, with two electric fans mouted on top (closest to the
trunk floor).  I drove the car from Hallett, OK (watched a friend win in a
GT2 914-6 at a National SCCA race) in 103+ temps to Plano (300+ miles) and
never saw 200 degrees oil temp.  I have run this cooler location for about
4,000 miles and haven't had a problem.  It is out of the way for all service
except removing the starter and that can be easily done without removal of
the cooler.  Ther is no indication road debris is going to get into the
cooler so I am satisfied so far with the setup.
Give some thought to these rearmount spots and test them, if possible.  I
know of three 6s useing rear mounted coolers in conjunction with their
original coolers.  They are local or soutwest cars and all have had good
results.  I have taken one additional precaution for under car engine heat
and had the 914-6s heat exchangers and exhaust thermally coated with a
semi-ceramic powder coat.  This coating made an amazing difference in the
temps of the heat exchangers and exhaust.  I would definately recommend it to
anyone running stock exhaust or headers.  Keep them cool!
