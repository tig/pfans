Jeff.....Here is some more dialog on the conversion and selection of pieces
that may suite your project.  I agree with Andy on one of his engine points.
 Installing a late 3.2L with a complete DME system requires all the OE
components and some fabrication for installation in the 914.  Another issue
is the matching of a transmission with clutch, PP and flywheel to make it all
work and 914-6 sheetmetal to fit the 3.2.  I have heard that Martin at MSDS
has fabricated 914-6 sheetmetal for the 3.2 so this question may have an
answer.  Gearbox fits would most likely fall on the 915 then adding drive
shaft and drive hub problems to the equasion.  In defense of the 3.2L choice
I will comment that the injected version would satisfy the emission concerns
carbs provide in the states that heavily regulate air quality.  It would also
give you a engine easily serviceable by just about any competant Porsche
service shop in the US.
Reguarding the statement on MFI fitment and power......I have helped install
a 2.2E engine in a 914-6 and adapt the MFI to the application.  In my opinion
MFI is a very unique setup, mystical to some, but very useable in a 6
conversion.   It installs in the 914 engine bay very easily and looks quite
at home.  It also works very well with good condition MFI components that are
correctly installed and adjusted.  A good 2.2E with MFI is a decent choice
producing well over 150 HP.  
Concerns I would have on any of these early engines is their reliability
(studs, cases, tensioners), longevity (75K average life) and their history of
leaking.  A certified, fresh 2.2E, 2.2S, 2.7 or low mile 3.0L would be my
choices.  In the defense of the cost of a 3.0L it is pretty easy to find
complete, good condition, 3.0L engine with less than 100K miles for $3,000.00
to $3,500.00.  I know of a recent purchase of a 80K mile, complete 3.0L with
carbs, and ignition that was made for $3,000.00.  Compression was perfect and
leakdown less than 5%.  Even at 80K you can expect that engine to run another
80K or more.  The engine was advertised in Excellence and Pano so the $$$$$
mentality of the 3.0L is defendable especially when the reliability and
longevity are added in.  Not to mention just over 200 HP and tons of torque
from 1500 RPM to 6500 RPM.  The 3.0L will take all the std. 914-6 sheetmetal
and can be easily mated to the 901 (914 style) gearbox.
In fact BRM (817-795-8914) has a 3.0L engine advertised for $2,500.00.
Don't rule the big engine out!
