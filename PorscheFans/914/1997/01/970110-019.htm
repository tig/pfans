You can try JE Pistons, they make a series of pistons for the type 4 that raise
the compression ratio from 7.0:1 to 13:1, these are race proven, they are big in
Cart, IMSA, SCCA, and NASCAR.  But they do make a nice piston, never used them
since I am building a stock class motor, but friends have.  Just remember
compression ratio raises heat, and then heat creates stress, stress tends to
cause failures.  So don't build a 13:1 street engine and expect it to go 100K
miles, it might last, then again probably not.  

Also invest in some better cooling capabilities.  If you are not running a
specific race group, maybe dry sumping could be an option.  Stable Energies has
a dry sump pump, but then so does allot of Type 1 engine people, I think all VW
oil pumps will fit the type 4.  Biggest problem is fitting the extra pump behind
the cooler housing.  Use a 914-6 or conversion tank, and then you gain some
extra quarts of oil, plus the capability to run an external oil cooler, safely.
Don't forget the oil thermostat to protect that cooler.  Plus no more lights
flickering on the dash when going around hard corners.
