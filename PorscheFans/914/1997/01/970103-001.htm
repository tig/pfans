Hi all, I am still here !

I ordered 40 Caught By Camera books from UK and they were shipped surface 
day after x-mass (UK Boxing Day). Various people have told me that that 
could mean any were from 2 to 4 weeks.

Any way if you had asked me to put you down for some I will E-Mail out 
bills and shipping to you options in the next week. I will then ship when 
I find out how you want it shipped to you, and I receive a check.

So Thats the story....

BTW the books ran about $13, with the shipping from UK but I don't have a 
copy of the invoice so it could go up or down a bit but that bit wont be 
much.

Dan
