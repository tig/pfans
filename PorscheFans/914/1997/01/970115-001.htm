Hi 914-er's!

Someone (no signature, and I can't decipher the initials) wrote:

"  Is there a way to bleed the master cylinder? I've had a spongy 
pedal for some  time.  I thought I needed to bleed the brakes again ( 
always once a year )  so... I did it several times over a period of time. 
 Still a spongy feel. By the way, I have no loss of fluid.  
I did run the reservoir down to the bottom ( wasn't watching close 
enough )  I think now maybe there is air trapped in the master 
cylinder  OR  it's time to buy a new one.   "

  Well... I can now say that although my pedal is still a bit spongey, it 
is better than it ever has been before, and I got there by following 
Josh Hadler's advice.

  First, I'll tell you what DOESN'T work... first hand knowledge from 
unpleasant experience.
  1.  Vacuum bleeding... although this was invented to enable the 
bleeding of dual-circuit brake systems, some of which could not be 
bled any other way, it is a miserable failure on the 914 with stock 
ATE brakes.  As near as I can determine, the piston seals on the 
ATE calipers simply cannot cope with even as little as 1/2  
atmosphere of negative pressure, and will leak air into the system 
from now until doomsday.  Vacuum bleeding is a complete bust.
  2.  Pressure bleeding... this is the alternative to vacuum bleeding, 
again intended for dual-circuit systems where the master cylinder 
does not lend itself to pump-the-pedal style bleeding.  In theory, this 
should sweep out all air in the system, but in practice, on the 914, the 
master cylinder itself apparently traps air in a protected volume that is 
unreached by fluid circulated through the system by external means.  
In other words, this doesn't work either.
  3.  Josh Hadler's method... this has been around since hydraulic 
brakes were first invented: simply pump the pedal.  There are some 
cars where this is impractical, owing to the design of the master 
cylinder (dual circuit dohickeys), but the 914 is not one of these.
  I was most sucessful with an assistant to apply pressure to the 
pedal, whereupon I opened the bleed screw, and allowed the pedal 
to descend to it's maximum permitted travel.  I then closed the bleed 
screw, and the assistant raised her foot.  By coaching the assistant, 
using verbal cues such as "up" and "down", I was able to make 
certain that there was positive pressure in the system at all times 
while the bleed screws were open.
  I found it necessary to bleed both bleed screws on each caliper and 
to go around the car doing this two or three times in succession 
before getting the lines to run free of bubbles.  (I used a glass jar with 
a clear plastic drop tube to observe air in the system.)
  The procedure requires about 3 quarts of brake fluid.  If you ever 
run the master cylinder reservoir dry, as was mentioned above, you 
have to start all over... that means ANOTHER 3 quarts.
  Upon analysis of the rate of bubble propagation backwards in the 
plastic line under the force of bouancy, and the position of the inlet 
and outlet lines on the brake proportioning valve, I decided that it is 
NOT necessary to disconnect brake lines and bleed at the valve, as 
some have suggested.  It appears that since the fluid exit is on top of 
the cylinder, and that the 19mm master cylinder moves a sufficient 
volume of fluid with each stroke, that any air in the proportioning 
valve will exit the unit at the top and be swept out the lines to the 
rear wheels.  
  This is a good thing; breaking the lines at that "T" on top of the 
valve is not only hard to do, but will allow brake fluid (read paint 
remover) to get at one of the most rust-prone areas of the car.
  To conclude, do as Josh has suggested:  Pump that pedal!

				Good Luck,
				Jim T.
