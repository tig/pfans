 Hey Jeff, 
 Im going to the swap meet too (Pomona?), (Im always there) Dont replace
that sucker, have it welded (remember welds are stronger) My buddy was
driving down the street and his broke too, dragging the trans down the
street. Got it back to the shop and welded them back on and has been
driving the crap out of it ever since and he has a six in there ! If
your going to the swap meet , It must mean your close to me ?? I know of
a welder that can weld it up and dose a great job and he's cheap. While
your walking around look me up, I'll be with a guy named Glenn. there
will be a new white Nissan extra cab with a shell in the space, I dont
remember the space number but its the 3rd or fouth row from the
restrooms, half way down on the west side and he will be selling 914
part (really?) If I dont see you good luck....Don
