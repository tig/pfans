"Last year I bought a 72 914-4 with a 1.8 in it. The battery tray was 
falling off so I took the battery and the tray out. There is some rust 
beneath the tray and along the inside arm. The battery tray was just 
sort of screwed in (with wood screws!) to the metal. I am wondering 
how I should fix this. "

  As has been said, it depends on how original you want to be.  My 
'74 914 has a battery tray that was formed out of heavy gauge sheet 
metal and is secured to the engine bay side wall with three large bolts 
and fender washers.  Originally, it was not too stiff, and so was 
propped up with a block of wood resting on the air conditioning 
compressor head!
  Needless to say, this didn't seem satisfactory to me, so I had two 
sides made for the thing, and am welding it up with my torch.  When I 
get finished, it should be sufficiently rigid to do the job without resting 
on anything else.  I elected to go this route because of cost, and 
because the tray can be readily removed by removing 3 bolts if 
access is needed to something below it.  Getting an original type tray 
welded on is going to be expensive, and means that the thing is 
permanently in your way.

"Should I get a new tray and try to bolt it to the inside wall? Or should 
it be welded? I don't have any welding experience. Is this something 
an amateur could do?"

  See above... an original-type tray cannot be bolted (I don't think) 
and will have to be welded on... How are you at MIG welding?  To 
be sure that there is minimum damage to the rest of the car, the job 
should be done by an experienced welder with good MIG equipment.

"What about the rust damage that already exists?
Is there any way this can be repaired at reasonable cost?"

  It depends on how bad this damage is.  In my case, the engine 
shelf in that area was history.  The lower firewall and a good sized 
portion of the engine bay side wall were  perforated in spots, 
although not in such a way as to be structurally significant.  Most 
importantly, upon peeling away the rotted remains of the engine shelf 
in that area, in my case, I discovered that the actual box sections 
comprising the chassis members were completely intact, although 
there was a significant hole on the top side, because they don't meet 
until they get up near the shock towers, and so the gap is normally 
covered with the engine shelf sheet metal.
  At any rate, I peeled off as much of the engine shelf metal as I 
could, sand-blasted the remaining surfaces, vacuumed out the inside 
of the chassis member to get rid of sand and loose rust, drowned the 
whole area (including the inside of the chassis members as well as 
possible) with Rustoleum rusty metal primer and finish coat white 
paint, and then glassed the whole area over with fibreglass cloth and 
epoxy resin, followed by more paint.
  The result is a pretty good looking repair that has the advantage of 
being impervious to further battery acid and other moisture 
contamination.  I was able to get away with it because the underlying 
structural steel was in good shape.  The engine bay sidewall is not 
structurally critical except near the top edge; my damage was limited 
to a roughly 4" equilateral tringular area right down in the lower 
corner, plus some perforations where the old battery tray attachment 
welds were, and quite a bit of pitting below that.  Because of this, I 
carried the glass up the side wall past the battery tray weldment.  I 
used  4 layers of glass over the hole in the box sections left by 
removal of the old engine shelf; only 2 going up the side wall.
  Was it cheap?  You bet; much cheaper than trying to get those 
parts welded in by someone competent to do the job.  How good a 
repair is it?  Well... that depends... as far as preventing further rust, I 
think that it's actually better than welding a new engine shelf back in 
there.  I don't see how anyone could make the weldment so good 
that no further splashed rainwater could get in between the parts to 
begin the rust process all over again; the glass and epoxy seal it 
completely.  Structurally, the glass probably adds nothing at all, so if 
my assesment of the structural strength of the surviving steel parts 
was in error, I will be in trouble.  I'll let you know for sure in about 5 
years.

  I am posting this in it's somewhat lengthy detail so that others on the 
list can comment and advise you on the applicability to your particular 
case.

 			 Best of luck with your project,
			Jim T.
