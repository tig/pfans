Spent some time doing tune up chores this weekend (valves, point, timing)
and installed new lines all over the place to try to do two things.
One: get rid of the gas smell in the cabin.
     I found that the square plastic fuel pump seems to be leaking. I
installed all new lines, made sure of all the hose clamps and
connection. No rust at all, the carpet spots that line the tank look
brand new. So I know its not the tank. I've ordered the new fuel filter
so I'll put that in tonite (in the dark, I'm sure ). I sure like the
fuel pump up front with trapdoor exit on the 75. Makes it alot easier. 

Two: solve the "hunting" idle and stalling after deceleration
     Kudos to DD for the advice last week. I found that I seem to have
been lacking a Carcoal canister entirely. So I took the one off the
front of my parts 73 and installed it  by the battery in the 75 engine
compartment. I then checked and replaced every vacuum line I could with
quality rubber. That sure helped the "hunting", but the car still likes
to stall when you let off  the gas. It will start and idle, hot or cold,
just fine now.
Obviously, messing with the mixture now is not going to cure anything. I
don't seem too have any problem with oil and gas cap sealing. 

One hose is obviously missing. There is the large "S" elbow that runs
from the aircleaner/ metering box to the throttle housing, ok. There is
a hose coming off this that goes to the deceleration valve and to what?
See, the "Y" is there, but theres a cork plug in it so I dont know where
to run the other side! Any one out there any good with this stuff?

I am going to get the Haynes for VW bus book if it has any good FI info.

Thanks to all for helping.
