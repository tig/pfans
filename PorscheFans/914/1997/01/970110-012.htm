Hi folks!

Hope everyone had some great holidays!  Mine were spent in the
garage (i.e. perfect), and I even got to meet Dave Darling (btw
Dave, Heather now calls you "Meatloaf" =8^)

I've been gutting the interior of my car in preparation for
repaint.  While I'm in there, I will be replacing the plastic
fuel lines in the center tunnel with some SS tubing (would copper
be a better choice?  I will be using tubing, and not pipe).  I
plan to follow Jim Pasha's Excellence article when I do this.
I've also modified the shifter to a short shift, and will be
putting in new cables.  I will also need to add a hand throttle
for my CIS.  While the tunnel is completely empty, I'd like to
clean it out somehow coat it to prevent any possible rust.
Has anyone done this before?  Accessibility in there isn't too
great, so I'm not too sure how I can clean it out, much less
paint it.  I was planning to use POR15 in there, like the rest
of the car, but don't know of any way to get it in there; the
stuff will ruin a paint gun....

Thanks,
Mike
