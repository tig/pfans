The rear 914-6 caliper rebuild kits I just received from Alan Johnson Racing
did NOT include the FLUID CHANNEL O-RINGS between the caliper
halves.

I am in the midst of "NEGOTIATING" with the parts manager, trying to
convince him that they indeed should be included with the kit.  At present
he has advised me that they are not shown on the exploded parts diagram
therefore they are not required.  He had agreed to look into it & get back to
me.  I'll keep you posted.

However, in the meantime I recommend against purchasing any rear caliper
kits from them,  even though they are one of the few who even offers one for
the 914-6 rear.

Thx,
