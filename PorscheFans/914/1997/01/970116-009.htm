In autocross, STICK is everything.   Put the widest tires that fit, or are
allowed by class.  If you have a choice, choose slicks over dedicated
autocross tires.  Never look back...for you will see the opposition 
putting money into useless horsepower.

In a relativfely underpowered car like a 914, you MIGHT want to
consider smaller wheel diameters to give you a better overall
gear ratio and therefore better acceleration.  My personal opinion
is that it is probably a straight trade-off with tire width.  I think a
914 would have trouble fitting a much smaller tire anyway.  If Dave
Ferguson is reading this, he will give you a more informed opinion.
He and the Mrs beat the entire field of 500+ Porsches at the 95
Parade, against some serious competition, in a 914-6.

At the same parade I asked the Yokohama tech rep if I should
consider slicks over A008-RSIIs (the yoki autocross tire).  He 
said any slick would be faster, but that the Yokis would last 
longer.
