Hello, I am new to the list but not new to Porsche's.  I have a signal
orange 70 914-6.  Not concours but nice.  I crewed for the #64 IMSA GTO
(Couplan/Hulen) out of Indianapolis in the 80's.  So... I hope I can
make a contribution to the list.

The past two months I have had my first real trouble with my sixer.
The alternator quit.  I took it to a local rebuilder, he 'rebuilt' it,
and I installed it with a new regulator.  Long story short, I have now
r&r'd the alternator three times, part in due to the rebuilder, part due
to a faulty new regulator. (or so says the rebuilder)

Currently the alternator has a click and ringing bang, motor running. 
Not much of a noise at idle, but frantic at 2000-3000 rpm, like the fan
is hitting the housing.  Idea's anyone?  Does you have an idea or know
the best way to tell if I have lined up the housing on the dowel pin? 
I'm used to 911's on the stand, not a backward blind job like a sixer. 
A second note is the rebuilder claims to have used 'delco' bearings.  I
am suspect, but hoping someone has an idea what the noise is.  I tried
making the band on the housing tighter, looser.  I tighten the belt.  My
next step is to loosen the belt.  After that I'll try loosening and
relocating the housing.  Idea's?

Frankly, I wish an 914-6 alternator replacement on nobody.  Especially
three times.  I am down to an hour taking it out, but still need three
to install.

John Cullen, 70 914-6, 88 Merkur Scorpio, 85 XR4Ti
