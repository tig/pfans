Thanks Steve, Dion, Mike, Cory, and A914Guy for all the ideas!! 

The results so far: - distributor cap was dry inside - relay board was dry
on both sides - insides of carbs are dry - definitely not flooding with
gas, this car is almost impossible to flood - car has had time and improved
weather conditions to dry out - still turns but does not fire.

A914Guy is quite right that the humidity should not have been enough to
kill the car. So, thinking back to other causes related to the last time I
drove it...

When last drove it was just before Christmas. It was below freezing and the
car was very hard to start. It usually is when the weather is cold and the
car has not been driven for a couple of days. When the temperature is below
40 degrees, it takes a lot of battery amps to get the engine to turn much
at all -- often requiring several minutes of attempting to start to get it
going enough to keep running. This last time was no exception. But once I
got it started, it ran fine and restarted easily.

Now I am noticing that the starter motor is sounding weak -- it seems to be
having trouble turning the engine. Could the starter motor have gotten too
weak to crank the engine?

I keep recharging the battery between major attempts and have also tried
starting with a battery boost from another car -- so it is surely getting
enough power. Still the starter sounds like its having trouble turning the
engine and does not sound any better even with the battery boost.

Derek (starting to get claustrophobic driving my other car which has a
fixed roof)
