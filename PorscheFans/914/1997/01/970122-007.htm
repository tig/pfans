He asked for opinions.....

Good plan.

Fuel pump should be the same.  The injection system is different
though.  Make sure you get the brain from the new engine.

If the 2.0 has been converted to carbs, DON'T BOTHER!  A 1.7 FI
is a nicer motor than a 2.0 Carb.

Yup.

> 4.  What difference in motor mounts between the 72 1.7L engine and a

4 years of age.  (They're identical)

You asked about transmissions...   Converting to a side-shifter
is a "good" thing.  Not too hard (from what I hear).  You use
the old linkage from to knob to "some point", then attach the
later linkage.

Sounds like you found someone's dead '76-2.0 project.  You should
be able to get the pieces you need from the donor car.  (If not,
most of us have extras :).

But once again, if it's a carb'd engine, DO NOT BOTHER.
