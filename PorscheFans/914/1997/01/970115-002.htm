Hi 914-er's!

Dion Dunn asks:


"I tried checking the stock fuel pump last night, but seemed to run 
into a bit of trouble.  When I hook it up to a power source, I can here 
it wizzing away.  When I attach fuel lines to it and submerge the 'S' 
line into a container of fuel, nothing comes out either of the other 
lines.  I tried sucking the fuel through, changing the angle and height 
of the pump, etc. Again, nothing.  I've taken the top cover off of the 
pump, and the thing looked clean as a whistle.

Do I need to 'bench-bleed' the pump some how?   "

  Not exactly... the pump uses small steel rollers in a slotted rotor that 
rotates in an eccentric chamber to move the fuel.  The rollers are 
held in place against the outside wall of the chamber by centrifugal 
force.  (Yes, Josh, (and all other physicists on the list), I know that 
there's no such thing as centrifugal force, but explaining how the 
outer wall of the pump applies centripital acceleration to the rollers 
would get me way off the subject, as I am now.)
  Anyway, the mechanism is pretty good at pumping liquids, but not 
much good at pumping gasses.  Hence, to work properly, the pump 
is located below the tank when in the car, and is gravity fed to it's 
input or "suction" side.
  To make it work on the bench, you either need to construct a 
special test tank with an outlet at the bottom, or you will need to 
place the tank in an elevated location and start a siphon through the 
supply hose (I don't recommend mouth pippetting for this!), and then 
connect the hose with fuel flowing to the pump inlet.  Once you have 
done this, energize the pump, and it should produce considerable 
pressure.

				Good Luck,
				Jim T.
