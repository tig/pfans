Since 5 degrees is too cold to work on my fourteener, I thought I'd use =
up some bandwidth and ask dumb questions instead...
I bought a Weltmeister adjustable brake proportioning valve for my '76, =
but it is meant for the earlier cars.  The later proportioning valves =
don't have the "T" on to split the line to the rear brakes, instead =
there are two separate holes for each of the rear brake lines.  =
Naturally this means the brake lines are different than the earlier =
cars.  I am going to get the "T" fitting, but does anyone know if the =
proportioning valves are mounted in the same place on both versions?  If =
they are, I should be able to get the earlier brake lines and bolt them =
right up.  If not, I guess I need to make new ones, or have them made.
I've seen tubing benders and flaring tools for sale, but what type of =
flare does the 914 use?  Any ideas where to get fittings (I don't want =
to trash my original lines)?

Thanks
Andy Lester
