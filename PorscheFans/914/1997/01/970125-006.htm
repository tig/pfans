In response to the recent inquiry, when I bought my 914 the 2.0 engine had
been reassembled without the cooling flaps.  I drove the car for several
months without them, in Phoenix!  I can't swear there was no problem, and I
have since had the engine rebuilt.  It's possible the lack of a cooling flap
contributed to the failed valve guide in #3 cylinder, but by that time I had
rigged a flap on that side.  You can do the work with the engine in the car.
 Obviously, I do recommend installing the flaps.  However, even after idling
on the freeway for an hour without any, and without the firewall flaps
either, my car registered only 235 degrees.  Hot, to be sure, but not
disaster.
