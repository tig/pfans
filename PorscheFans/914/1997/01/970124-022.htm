  Ok, in my continuing voyage of discovery with my new car, limited by it
  raining all week and it being parked outside with a tarp over it, I just
  discovered that the bonehead who rebuilt the engine for P.O. just before
  I bought the car not only left the thermostat off but also the internal
  flaps in the fan shroud.

  I want to replace them.  What if any is the immediate problem with not
  having these?  I will have to drive the car about an hour or so on  the
  freeway to get to where I'm getting the carbs replaced with the original
  FI system.  Any problems for a short run like this, likely to overheat?
  I'm not that familiar with the T4 engine and how critical the flaps are
  to internal air flow.

  Can the flaps be replaced without dropping the engine and removing the
  fan shroud?  Once we pull the carbs the top of engine will be
  uncluttered. Can I remove the upper cylinder shrouds and get the flaps in
  before putting on the FI system?  Looks like the drivers side wouldn't be
  a problem but not sure about the passenger side with the oil cooler.


  Thanks
  Jeff   (with growing itch to take 'newly' rebuilt engine and tear apart
  and ressemble again)
