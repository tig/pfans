While it's true that you will probably never recoup the full value of your
investment in a classic car (geez, I'm starting to sound like one of those
financail people), you will recoup some of it. This is part of my reason
to buy an older classic. The alternative is to sink money into a car
that's losing value as you pay off the principle+interest on the loan. Or,
even after the car is paid off, sinking money into a car that's never
going to increase in value. Take my wife's Hyundai Sonanta as an example. 
It's paid for, but whatever money I put into it to repair it is money down
the toilet as far as recouping my investment is concerned (we do get to
drive the car, however) because it's never going to be worthvery much, 
and is still losing value. My 914, however, has already been fully 
depreciated, and since it has an enthusiastic following, any money I put 
into it will add value to the car. It's still a losing situation, since 
you can only expect a return of maybe 1/3, but it's much less of a losing 
situation than the Hyundai (or any modern car, for that matter). My 
criteria for good car candidates areas follows (others would be 
different, of course):
1) The car must be fully depreciated.
2) It must have an enthusiast following (ie, a "cult" car).
3) Aftermarket parts must be plentiful.
4) It must be high quality.
5) The purchase price must be affordable for me (this would vary for 
others, obviously).

Cars that I've found that fit this description are:

1) Porsche 914
2) Porsche 912
3) BMW 2002
4) VW aircooled (types 1-3)

There are other candiates that I haven't investigated yet, like the 
Porsche 924/944, Datsun Z cars, etc.
