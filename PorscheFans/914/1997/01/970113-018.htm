It's the injector.  It expands as it gets hot, and the crack closes.

General note:  The injector closest to the pump seems to fail first.

It's supposed to be that way; a *slight* bow in at the top.

Worry when:
1:  Left and right are different,
2:  There is a sudden change in either side.
    (But if there is a sudden change, it will be the right side)
3:  The camber is more than slight.
