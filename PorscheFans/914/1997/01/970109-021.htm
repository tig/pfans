A company called FAT performance does this conversion. I am considering the 
same thing, if I ever find a set of 7 & 8X15 Fuchs at the right price.

I called recently about the price of the machining, and it worked out to 
somewhere around $300 for drilling and studding four discs and the rear 
hubs, including studs.

They are in Orange, Ca. Ph. 714-637-2889

If anyone has any experience with this conversion, i'd be interested to hear 
about it.

See ya,
