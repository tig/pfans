I tried the torch method. Don't do it! It's messy, smelly, and a royal
pain in the butt. I took my trailing arms to a machine shop that had a
long throw hydraulic press and _ZIP_, out they came. Clean. It's cheap,
easy, and it doesn't smell. That's what I'd recomend.

When installing the new bushings, two things: One, make sure they fit
well, trim them as neccessary and dry fit them. Then two: use that
really messy plastic bushing grease that can only be called whale snot.
It's actually a silicon based grease, and it's really messy. But it'll
keep those bushings from squeeking.
