For Jeff and other interested parties:

  Jeff asks:

"    Anyone have recommendations on the high tech spiral wound 
type wires? .....
.......   I've read that for the high tech electronic   ignitions, the plug 
wire with low impedance, spiral winding around a  center core, is 
best.     "

  I don't know much about modern types of ignition supressor wire, 
but one thing I do know... a spiral is a coil which means inductance 
which means high impedance.  

  Dirk Wright wrote:  
  
"   The magnetic core suppresses resonance in the square 
waveform of the spark pulse.   "  

  This is essentially correct, except that I would say that a spiral wrap 
around a magnetic core would present considerable inductance, 
which would limit the rise time of an applied square wave, which 
would reduce it's high frequency content, which would clean up your 
radio.

  The only catch, is that this is a high Z (impedance), not low Z 
scheme.  Whether or not you need really low Z to allow the system to 
ring really well or not is something that would best be determined by 
the manufacturer of the ignition system, but if so, nothing beats a 
straight piece of stranded wire with good insulation.
