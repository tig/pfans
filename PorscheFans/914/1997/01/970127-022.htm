    94-100 pounds or so for both.

    Again, 100 pounds or so.

    Yes... Antiseize is required.

    If you're using steel lug nuts, it's important to put antiseize
    on the FACE of the nut... You don't want to tighten a bare steel
    nut against an alloy wheel.

    Also, those adapters are really an accident waiting to happen...
    Around here, you can't even get them approved by the local PCA
    tech inspectors for use at an autocross.

    Have you thought about properly drilling your hubs for the
    five-spoke wheels?
