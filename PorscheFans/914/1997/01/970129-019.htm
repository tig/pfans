  "The 914 fuel line recall program is still active.  It is designed to 
prevent fuel line failure and a very dangerous fire hazzard.  We urge 
any 914 owner who has not had his fuel lines upgraded to call his local 
Porsche dealer about this program.  As long as your engine's hoses 
have never been upgraded, you're eligible.  If the dealer doesn't know 
about it, tell them to call the Factory representative."

But, just in case 
they mean the plastic lines... why spend all that money and do all that 
work when Porsche might do it for you for free?
  Does anyone know in detail what this recall is all about?

My understanding is that the 914 fuel line recall involved
replacing the original metal fuel lines with plastic lines.
The problem is that the fuel lines run underneath the
battery and battery acid could drip on to and corrode
the metal lines causing a great fire hazard.  The plastic
replacement lines are impervious to battery acid.

If you have plastic fuel lines, then your car has already
had that recall work done to it.
