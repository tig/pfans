I'm no guru, but I've always heard that it was because the VW combustion 
chamber shape and valve layout was so bad, on top of the fact that the 
head temperature is much higher for air cooled engines than they are for 
water cooled. Unless the cooling system is enhanced, going to a high 
compression ratio or significantly increasing the displacment will mean 
higher temperatures and therefore shorter engine life.

Is this a Bently manual? If so, which one?

So are you going to have problems fitting the stock exhaust, or does it 
fit fine?

I'm sure you're aware that bigger valves mean that the area between them 
is less, so they are even more prone to cracking. Also, the vw heads 
wouldn't perfrom aws well as real 914 2.0 ones would.

I wasn't aware that 2.0 bus p&c's were poor quality. Keith Black makes 
some apparently really nice p&c's for the Type IV motor. FAT sells them.

Yeah, any changes to displacmentor valve timing will disrupt the vacuum, 
thus adversely affecting the D Jet manifold pressure sensor. You can 
adjust it however, as outlined on Tim's web page 
(http://www.estinc.com/porsche)
