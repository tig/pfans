250-260 is a bit too high. Make sure that the internal cowling flaps are
installed properly. If they are installed backwards, your engine will
cook. Second, check your fan for missing blades, even one can cause a
cooling problem.

Overfill your engine by a half quart or so, this should leave enough oil
in the sump to help prevent high-g oil starvation. Also, and this is
only a guess, the position your oil pressure sensor is mounted in may
have something to do with it. Let me guess, the line come up out of th
sheet metal and connects with the sender towards the rih hand side of
the car. If this is so, the oil is being pulled away from the sender. I
have the same problem under heavy braking when the oil is hot. It's very
unnerving. I plan on relocating my sender so that the only acceleration
that can have this effect is that of the engine, so I'm pretty safe
there. I've never heard of a 914-4 that can out accelerate it's brakes.
