I'm helping a friend research upgrades to his 914.  He is in the process of
acquiring parts for the 5-lug conversion.  So far, we have found most of the
parts, but had a few questions.

We found a set of 6X15 Fuchs off a 73 911 and were wandering if this set of
wheels with 195/50-15 tires would fit under the stock bodywork or are there
some better options to look at?  The car is going to be used mainly for the
street with some autocross and drivers ed thrown in.

From what I know about 914s (knowledge gained mainly from this list),  I know
that some people are getting the rear hubs drilled for the 5-lug pattern vs.
finding /6 hubs,  who does this and what is the cost (of course, we're
looking for reasonable and good quality) - is there such a thing :-)?  What
size studs are used(length) and are spacers needed?

Any help would be much appreciated and I'm sure I'll have some more questions
in the near future.

         Thanks,   Scott
