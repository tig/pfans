 Everything from the firewall forward is the same (at least from my "old" 
 memory; of course I did the change six or was it seven years ago).  You 
 will have to re-adjust the shifter once installed from inside the tunnel 
 since it will probably be off alignment from your previous tranny.

Well Mike, they *do* say the memory is the first thing to go.  The reality is
that about the only thing that's the same is the shift knob.  The lever is
different, (fork on the bottom instead of ball) the shift tower is different,
(no anti-rotate pin) the rod, coupling, rear rod, motor mount and attachments
and the bushing in the firewall.  You will need a "conversion" bushing which
has the correct OD for the firewall and the correct ID for the rod on the
coupling.  (I think Automotion sells these)  These are the parts needed if
you are replacing the gearbox with a sideshifter.  You can also convert a
"tail-shift" gearbox to a sideshifter by replacing the internal shift rails,
removing the old tailshift actuating lever in the tailpiece and plugging the
hole, then adding the sideshift console in place of the old brass pivot fork
plate .  If you're converting a 914-6 you also have to fabricate a new rear
shift rod as the factory 4 cyl rod will not clear the left heat exchanger.
