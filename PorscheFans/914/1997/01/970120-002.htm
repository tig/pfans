In a message dated 97-01-19 19:40:25 EST, you write:

<< 1. I am allowed "soft" plastic pushings as replacemnts in the class I run
(BI),
 If I replace the problem side with the "soft"  bushings, will it be
comparable
 to the other side or will I also need to do the otherside at the same time?
 I
 know Weltmeister sells "street" plastics which I assume is the same as
"soft",
 does anyone have experience with these? are there others out there that are
 superior?>>
The Automotion "street" bushings are significantly harder than street, but
softer than the race bushings.  Replace all four, since if one went out, the
rest are probably not far behind, plus the are stiffer. They will make a
SIGNIFICANT improvement in handling, especially if done on all 4 wheels.
Weltmeister is the only company I know of that manufactures a street bushing.
 The factory bushings were never available seperately, you had to replace the
whole control arm.
 
 <<2. Last time the arms were off I had the heat exchangers, half shafts etc
off
 also so it was not hard to do, this time I am trying to save a few steps but
 cannot see a way...... can I get away with leaving the heat exchangers on
and
 just disconecting the half shafts from the transmission and take them along
with
 the arms to the machine shop?>>
You SHOULD take off the half shaft by removing the castellated nut on the
hub.  It would be extremely difficult to press out the bushing shaft with the
halfshaft still connected, they might damage the CV joints, the whole thing
will be heavy and hard to manage.  You can remove the arm without removing
the heat exchangers, but you'll have problems getting to the inner nut.
 Remoivng the exchangers, if you've had them off recently, might SAVE you
time and aggravation. Remember, you need to have the rearned realigned when
you are done.
 
 <<3.  A week or so someone was talking about the grease used to install the
 plastic bushing (elephant snot!), what is the real name of this lovely
stuff?  
  >>
It is the suspension bushing grease that Automotion sells in their catalog
(Magic-Lube Plastic Bushing Lubricant, pn BP-172 for 1oz, enough to do one
car, $2.50, 1-800-777-8881). It is the only stuff I've seen that keeps the
bushings from squeaking.  It is tenacious, sticky, won't wash off your hands
without a solvent, and a general mess to work with, but perfect for the job.
