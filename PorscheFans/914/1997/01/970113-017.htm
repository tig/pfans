Dirk Writes, "Did you see the posting from Ralph Ricks? The 914 has a great Cd
(for a car designed in the '60's) of between .34 and .35. This is better than 
the 911 or 928. (hey - something to crow about!). The new Boxster is .31. 
I think most air dams and wings are not intended to reduce the Cd, but to 
provide downforce and high speed stability. Adding wings, fenderflares, 
etc., is a tradeoff between aerodynamic effeiciency (as expressed by a 
low Cd) and low (or no) lift at high speeds. Sure, or P car has a low Cd, 
but with the stock front valence and no wings, I'm sure it has plenty of 
lift at high speeds. Since I don't drive this fast (over 70, usually), 
these add ons won't do much for me. Most wings on street cars are just 
for looks, anyway."

Thank you for the response Dirk.  Actually I haven't seen one post regarding my
questioning, until now, when you wrote.

I am more engineeringly involved, than one simple overall Cd number.  BTW I'd
like to see the tests which established that number, does Ralph Ricks or anyone
else know where they exist?  Further, I want to see:  the wind tunnel smoke
trails at certain points to know where flow goes from laminar to turbulent & if
it returns to laminar or becomes actual drag; how thick the boundary layer
is/where; and, to know the real downforce calculations achieved with placement
of certain sized wings and where.

I AM interested in high speed stability and downforce.  Thanks for bringing it
up. 

If you want one great engineering tome on the subject read, "Race Car
Aerodynamics - Designing For Speed", by Dr. Joseph Katz.  Once you slog through
that, you'll know the level of interest I have.

I have the fiberglass bodywork ALL around, and already have monster flares (11"
Front / 15" Rear) and a one-piece IMSA air dam as a given, with the attendant
drag they produce.  What  I am trying to figure out is the efficiency of the
roll bar that is part of the body design, including top-on, top-off
efficiencies, and which placement of a wing at the rear is optimal.

You mentioned something to crow about, well, being a mid-engined design, that
leaves plenty of latitude for the adventurous to design an underpan with turning
vanes which can generate great amounts of downforce and stability, without drag,
if done right (read - not just another cosmetic tack-on).
