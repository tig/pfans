Here's my request a second time around.

I can't believe it, no one knows of wind tunnel tests on our beloved 914!?  Now
that seems strange, when you consider all of the aerodynamic gizzmos you see
attached to different 914s.  Could it be possible that they are all concoctions
of some group of artsy people, and none have a thing to do with aerodynamic
findings?

I find it hard to believe that Porsche, with one of the most state-of-the-art
wind tunnels on the planet, never put a fourteener in the tunnel to see what it
did.  Maybe not.  I just thought someone may have seen a write up, and could
point me in the direction.  I may have to fire off a letter to Weissach or
Stuttgart to get some info.  I had some correspondence with Dr. Dusan Gruden a
couple years ago, over environmental issues of oil, at Dr. Ing. H.c.F. Porsche,
Postfach 1140, 7251 Weissach, Germany, so that will probably still work.
Anybody got the address for Stuttgart?  Is there an e-mail address for
Stuttgart?  (Talk about intravenous feeding!)

In case you're wondering why I'm so curious; the area immediately behind the
roll bar puzzles me - whether it can be cleaned up aerodynamically, and the
other area is hanging a wing off the back appears to have been done incorrectly
in most applications I've seen.  I want to apply aerodynamic principles
correctly when I do it, not just create a rolling art form that's in-truth an
aerodynamic sailboat.
