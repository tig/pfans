Hello all,

I am the lucky person who picked up the barn of 914 parts in Dayton, Ohio.  Yes
I am that fool, but I can say that I now have enough parts to build about 5
914s.  Anyway I have just finished cataloging my first 3 trips, have one truck
load left.  And I am running out of garage space, attic space, shed space,
parents garage space, you get the idea.  I have a ton of stuff that needs to
find a new home.  So I am having a help me clean out my garage sale, most items
are going for incredibly cheap prices.  Don't worry about insulting me, give me
enough money for my efforts, and cover shipping and it will be yours.  If you
are wondering, I currently have, about 12 pages of parts, and still have a
truck, and 2 parts cars to go.  So chances are I have the part, about any part,
except alloys, sorry.

Drop me a note  directly, don't want to waste bandwidth of the list, to
102036.2004@Compuserve.com, please help me find my 914 again, please.

Stephen Jacobs
Currently owning more 914s than I can shack a stick at.
