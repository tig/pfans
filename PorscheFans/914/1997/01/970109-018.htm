Start with Euro Pistons. They will give you 8.0:1 by themselves. A full
point of CR from cutting the heads is a pretty healty cut.

There is a BIG difference between .0010 and 10 thousandths. By about 10
times. 10 thou is alot to shave off of anything, that's .010". Be
carefull.

The main issue is to make sure that there is enough room left for the
pistons to complete their full travel and that valves will not be around
when that happens. I have heard of 914 race motors running as high as
13:1 or more CR. Call around to other motor builders and see what they
do. Just keep in mind that the higher CR, the higher the engine temps
will get. No way to avoid it, just try and draw more of the heat away
with better air flow and more oil.

Also, the more you shave, the more you need to consider the pushrod
length. If you shave alot off, the stock pushrods will be that much too
long.
