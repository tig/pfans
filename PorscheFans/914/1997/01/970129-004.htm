You certainly have overactive brain cells :-)

You state, "I can apply the primer, then top coat with an epoxy paint to resist
corrosion and chemicals. I was thinking either lime green or bright yellow."

Jebby responds;
"Before you're done Dirk, don't forget to wire up some of those neon purple,
green and blue lights to the underside of your ride, so we all can see your
handy work :-]"

I can't wait to see what'd happen with you in a room with a welding torch, a
paint spray gun, and a pneumatic nailer.  Your creativity might give us another
Statue of Liberty :-]  Have you every considered pottery? : - )

Let us know how the tranny turns out.  Post a pic on our anemic 914 section of
the PorscheFans web page.  Speaking of which, if Andy really does sell his Red
Mitcom Beauty this week, that picture section will be down to one snap shot.
We'd all better get busy and send them some pics.  I just need to figure out how
to reconfigure mine to .jpeg from .bmp, and I'll send in some.


Keep up the creativity Dirk.

_/  \_ I'd rather be autocrossing.

(Someone posted & told me that the nose of my cone came out bent on their
screen.  I guess I ran over it :-]   )
