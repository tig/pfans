<< Also, I purchased a GT replica lid from Doc & Cy's about 3-4 years ago.
 It was made by someone who worked for them or something (memory
 fading).  It was made using a very close style mesh in the same manner
 the orig GT lids were made.  Unless you look at them next to each other I 
 doubt you would know the difference.  You may also try to contact them
 to find out if they are still available or if they can put you in touch with
 the person for details.  The # is 1-800-950-0356  Good Luck & let us 
 know what you find out!!

Be real careful of these guys.  I ordered one of their lids in 1994, and got
a lid that had apparently been sitting out in a junkyard for years that was
rusted thru in places (you ever see a rusted engine lid on a 914 before!).
 And I had sent them a good clean lid as an exchange. Then they had WELDED on
the grill, with no primer or paint, so the thing was already rusting!!  A
real piece of junk.  I got my money back and my good lid back, promptly,
which is on the plus side for them.  I've got picture of the thing around
here someplace; it was so bad I had to have the pictures so people would
believe me!
I ultimately ended up with a quality product from Automobile Atlanta for
about the same price.
