Now that the tax refund check is getting near, and spring is around the
corner (I hope!), it's time to plan some more purchases for the 75 2.0.

First on the list is a 22 or 23 mm swaybar (front).  I've been reding the
recent threads, and have a few additional questions.

(1) I was planning on purchasing a Weltmeister unit.  Someone had mentioned
another that was supposedly as good quality, adjustable, and less costly.
Since I cannot find that post, can someone enlighten me?  Also who carries it?

(2) Weltmeister also sells an "adapter kit for all 914 without thru-body
front sway bar.  Does not require gas tank removal."

My car appears to have not come with the swaybar option.  There are
attachment flanges on the A-arms however. Does the above kit allow you to
install the sway bar under the body without cutting?  Since I have heard
about heavier swaybars causing cracks in the body, is this installation
preferable?

Thanks in advance for te advise.
