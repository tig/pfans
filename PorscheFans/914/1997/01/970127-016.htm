Jerry and Brian:

Yeah, I did... And on Wednesday, if everything goes according to 
plan, a local racer will be buying it from me for $14,500.

Keep in mind, though, that a lot of the money I spent went toward the
suspension, chassis, wheels, brakes, transmission, seats, belts,
cage, gauges, etc... And that the motor I chose was pretty expensive,
too.

If all you want is a more-or-less exact replica of the 110-horsepower
2-liter FACTORY 914/6, you could probably do the conversion for
around $10K.

On the other hand, though, you can BUY a factory 914/6 for about that 
much, so I don't know why you'd bother building one.
