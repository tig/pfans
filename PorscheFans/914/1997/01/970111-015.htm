Hi 914-er's!

  I can't explain this, except to reproduce what Dave Darling told me 
(and I respect his opinion highly):

Dave D:
  "Good idea to stick this in the FAQ.  Thanks.  (Still workin' on
it on and off, BTW...)

Jim T:

Dave D:

 "Here in the Bay Area, you can't get leaded gas.  Everyone I know
who owns a 914 runs on the reformulated crap we're using.  I haven't 
yet heard of big problems, so...
  In an old Pano article, Bruce Anderson talks about unleaded gas
and 914's.  I found it in one of the volumes of "Upfixin'".  He says 
that the 914 has always used the correct seats and guides to run 
with unleaded gas.
  (However, there are newer materials for valve guides that are
better than the original ones.)

Jim T:

Dave D:

  I put premium in my 914 for a long while, too.  Then I started to
think about the various labels, and read on (I think) the tank sticker
that it was 91 ROZ/RON.  Later, I read about RON and MON, and 
noticed that the local pumps were all labeled (R+M)/2.  I asked The 
List, and both Bruce A. and Pete A. (no relation   ;)  answered with 
the rule of thumb that RON is 8-10 "points" higher for the same gas 
than MON.  So the average reading for that gas would be 4-5 points 
lower than the RON.
	Oops, got to rambling.
	Anway, thanks for mentioning it for the FAQ.

Dave Darling                                     74 914 2.0 (VROOM!)
                   darling@simlab.arc.nasa.gov
"Persnickety Old Roadster, Sucks Cash, Hellaciously 
Expensive"--NJN


  Anyway, Dave goes into additional detail on Tim's 914 Fan web 
page (I forget exactly where), but the upshot is that 914's DON'T 
require premium fuel.
  I respect Dave's opinion highly, as well as those people that he 
quoted, but I'd hate to find out the hard way that an error has been 
made.  Maybe we could take a survey of 914 owners on the list and 
see how many are running stock regular pump gas, and what ill 
effects, if any they have noted.  Of course, raising compression 
above stock or other exotic tuning is a different story; I am mainly 
interested in stock motor requirements.
  Any comments?
				Regards,
				Jim T.
