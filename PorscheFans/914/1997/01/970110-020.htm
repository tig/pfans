>The broker claims that it's complete and has "minimal" rust, 
mostly around the rear quarter panels.  The broker doesn't
seem to be sure of the selling price, but I have heard him
mention both $2200 and $2500, which seems to be a very good
price for this car.<

In this price range, you will find one of two things, a rust bucket, or a steal.
I have tracked down 3 914-6s in this price range.  No.1 did not have serial
numbers or any build plates, but did have title.  Also was missing all lids a
fender and a door.  But it was all there, right.  Second, was a rust bucket,
which was supposed to be salvageable, yeah right.  This one had a tree growing
up where the cockpit once resided.  Get the car, needed to fall the tree, thus
destroying the car.  The third, was and still is a rust bucket, but then I knew
that going in, and don't mind the entry price.

>I plan to put in a larger or modified six, or more likely trade 
the car for a 914-6 conversion (any Pfan interest?).   I'm not 
really interested in the restoring the car to its original condition, 
I just want to have something fun that's a lot faster than my 944, 
and I don't want to spend more than around $6k total (if that's 
possible).<

If it is a steal, please find someone to swap, and don't destroy the car.
Please remember fewer of these where than Speedsters, and I am sure you can find
some one to help you out.

>Is it correct to say that some of the original 914-6 pieces 
can be expensive?  If so, what specific pieces should I be 
looking for when I go to inspect the car (besides looking
for rust)? 

Here's what I've got so far (please correct me if I'm wrong,
I feel a bit clueless here):

single engine mount
oil tank (where is it?)
exhaust
hubs
brakes
heat exchangers (what does it look like?)
engine sheet metal?<

You are correct, some can be impossible to find.  Brake parts, rear calipers,
and the hub.  Other than that the brakes are 911T parts.  Don't forget oil lines
and oil cooler, also washer bottle, and pump, and a few other small items.  Dash
section, and the other small idiosyncrasy parts.  The tranny, has a lower fifth,
to keep the engine cooler, and slightly better shift linkage, plus the throttle
linkage.

Don't get your hopes up, minimal rust, means something different to each person.
To some it means a spot about 1mm big, to others you don't find a car, just a
bunch of bumper stickers that resemble the shape of a 914.
