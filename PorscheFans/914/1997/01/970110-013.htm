Here's a trick I use to determine the clearance when setting up my 914-6 
race engine (12.5:1 compression ratio, .040" piston/valve clearance):

To verify minimum clearance:
Set up a single cylinder with zero clearance between the rocker arms and 
the valves.  Rotate the engine two revolutions to make sure the 
pistons/valves clear. (If you don't have clearance at this point you will 
need to shim the cylinders (thus decreasing the compression ratio).  
Using a dial indicator, (set to the top of the valve spring), adjust the 
valve inward using the rocker arm adjusting screws to the desired amount 
of clearance.   Rotate the engine two revolutions to check for clearance.

You can determine what your minimum clearance is by continuing to adjust 
the rocker arm until the piston/valves just touch (you can feel this 
pretty easily).  Use the dial indicator to determine the clear distance 
as you release the pressure on the adjuster.

I've never built a type-IV motor, but I'm pretty sure that this process 
would work.
