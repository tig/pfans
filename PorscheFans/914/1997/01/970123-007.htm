Well, I got the o-ring from the local dealer for about $1.50. Now I need to
get the tranny lube. I had been using Castrol with a little GearGuard (moly
additive). I have heard of Swepco for Porsche transmissions. What should I
use?

Also I have had two small problems with shifting. First, the 1st to 2nd
shift catches a bit half of the time - nothing much but not a smooth shift.
Second, if I have been cruising along in 5th for a time, and try to shift
down to 4th, it is hard to get it out of 5th. If I do a REALLY leisurely
shift, it comes out OK. Any ideas? Will changing lube brands make any
difference?
