I had my motorcycle mechanic do it.  He said it was similar
to rebuilding a racing fork.  (But he says that about everything)

The way I understand it, it's a job for the truely meticulous.

Mayby we could talk Bill Cooley into doing it?  He seems to
have the temprament for it.  And I'm sure we could find some
cores here on the list.

By the way, the difference between "normal" and freshly rebuilt,
properly vented rear brakes is huge.  Everyone should do it.
