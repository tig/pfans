 Hi All, 

 Good Luck Jeff , I bought 2 sets of cross drilled 911 rotors from them
and they used a bad pattern. holes toooo close to the egde. The parts
manager said they never had a problem with them before. I showed them to
my mechanic and he said they were junk ! Took them months to refund the
money. Bought from Troutman instead (very nice)
 Jeff try GPR

 Later,    Don
