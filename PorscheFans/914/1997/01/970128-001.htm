Hi 914-er's!

  Tom Kuby is having starter troubles, so...

  I posted a detailed starter troubleshooting procedure to Tim's 914 Fan 
web page quite awhile ago now... I think that it's still there, but I can't 
say exactly where 'cause my browser can't seem to find Tim's URL this 
morning.

  Anyhow,  there is a detailed procedure there relating where and what 
to measure.  If you can find the place where the voltage goes away, 
this is where the trouble is.

  As far as rebuilding a solenoid, it depends on what the problem is.  
The solenoid in the 914 does two things: 1, it drives the starter pinion 
into engagement with the ring gear on the flywheel, and 2, it closes a 
set of high-current contacts to switch on the starting motor.  If the 
solenoid is hanging up, it could be due to wear or lack of lubrication on 
the motor shaft or pivot points, or possibly in the solenoid armature 
itself.  If there is an electrical problem, it is probably due to wear and/or 
burning of the high-current switch contacts.  Anything but dried-out 
lubricant calls for replacement parts; the best solution is a rebuilt starter.
  
  I tried to look under the seat of my '74 just now, and I see some sort of 
plastic box under there, but my guess is that it has something to do with 
the seat belt logic.  There is a provision in the '74 cars which is 
supposed to prevent the engine's being started unless the seat belts 
are fastened, and there is a weight sensor in the passenger's seat so 
that it works for both seats if there is a passenger.  
  It is entirely possible that this is the relay refered to by Gary Helbig.  
Now, don't quote me, but there is a big, multi-pin connector lying loose 
on the car floor next to this relay box, and my "no seat belt - no start" 
feature has been defeated; I don't know how.  It might be as simple as 
pulling out the plug!

				Good Luck,
				Jim T.
