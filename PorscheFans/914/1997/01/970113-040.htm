Hi 914-er's!

" If I were to add an  oil cooler, I would do this: first, relocate battery 
in rear trunk,  second remove battery tray and support, third obtain a 
cooler and a  "pusher" fan that will fit against the wall where the 
battery was  mounted, fourth cut hole in wall slightly smaller than the 
size of the cooler, fifth mount cooler on inside (engine side) of wall 
with "pusher"  fan exhausting into the fender. Since I havent' done 
this, there are  probably several details that I haven't recited here."

  I can think of one detail... it depends on the size of the oil cooler, 
but I believe that the engine bay side walls are structurally important, 
at least near the upper part.  The rear door pillar, the box members 
coming up to the suspension console from the "pontoon", and the 
top of the engine bay side wall form a triangular structure that 
accounts for most of the vertical rigidity of the rear of the car.  
  If a large part of the engine bay side wall were cut away, this 
triangle would have one of it's three sides seriously weakened, 
leaving most of the rear suspension loads as bending moments on 
the box members that run up to the suspension console from below.  
This probably is less than desirable.  
  To minimize weakening of the structure, I'd suggest that if this 
method is used, that the hole cut out be as small as possiple, and as 
low and as far forward on the engine bay side wall as possible; this 
would be below and forward of the usual battery tray mounting point.
