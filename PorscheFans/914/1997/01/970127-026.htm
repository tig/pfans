Pressures are very important for tire life. Usually, the optimal
performance pressure would also be best for tire life. What kills race
tires is uneven tire wear and excessive heating. I used to run that size
A008Rs and I found that 28-32 lbs was a good range for these tires on a
914. This will vary from tire to tire and size to size. So your milage
may vary.
