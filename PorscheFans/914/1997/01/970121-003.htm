	Hi, all--my mailer is still being a yo-yo; up again down again.
Keeping up via the Archives.  Many many thanks to whomever set that up!

	Of these, the only one you'll find on a totally-stock car of any
kind (four-cylinder at least) is the oil temp.  And that, as you see, has
no numbers on it.
	If you get a calibrated sender/gauge set, you might want to use
Bruce A.'s figures for 911s.  Basically, below 180 is cold, up to 210 is
"normal", up to 230 or so is "hot", and 250+ is "Too Damn Hot!"
	Head temp figures have evidently been lost.  Jim Thorusen has asked
both Porsche ("It's a VW motor, ask them!") and VW ("We don't know.") with
no success.
	Oil pressure will vary with engine RPM, oil temperature, and of
course, whatever oil control piston spring you've got.  Bruce A's rule of
thumb for 911s is 10 PSI per 1000 RPM when the engine is warm.  Below this
is generally a problem.  Above this isn't--up to a point.
	My motor has the "heavy-duty" oil pressure spring in it, so it tops
out at about 65 PSI (I think) no matter what RPM or temp.  Could be wrong--
it's been a while since I've gotten to drive it...

	The clock is just a clock.
	The oil temp gauge has the usual ground wire, power wire, and the
wire(?)s for the illumination light.  It also has the "signal" wire.  That
one goes through the firewall, over to the right-side (battery side) of the
engine compartment, down through the engine tin there, across the front of
the motor behind the fan shroud, and down to the sender.  The sender is
in the second "sump plate" on the left-front bottom of the motor, right under
the end of the dipstick.  A broken sender wire usually results in a full-hot
reading and lots of owner panic.  (BTDT.)
	They don't make these senders any more, so you'll either have to go
to a wrecker for a stock one, or get one with a particular range and live
with whatever the results on the gauge are, or buy a sender and gauge set that
are calibrated to each other.
	BTW, don't put too much trust in the voltmeter.  It is not the best
designed VM setup I've ever seen.  I think it's mostly there for amusement
value.  You get to see it bounce up and down when you use your turn signals,
for instance.  (Some cars have VMs that work properly, most don't.)

	Good luck!
