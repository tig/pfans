Just thought I'd check.  I haven't received a PorscheFans post since just before
new years.  Wondering if the system or sysop was mad because I sent such a long
"Getting To Know You" tome : - )

I put in a personal query post to another 914er (Jim Meyer) on the list, and he
was scratching his head too.

Are we having cyber problems, or is this a leftover from Boxing Day?

On to 914 matters.

Did the shipments of _Caught By Camera_ arrive?  Even though I paid a premium
for my copy, I like it.  The info is technically errant at times, but it is
intriguing reading for us 914 types.  Nice coffee table piece.  I'd love to see
a follow up with even better photography, and editing

Another matter:
I have a friend making me an offer I can't refuse (or at least I don't want to)
for an IMSA GT2 prepared 914-6.  I think this will make the perfect autocrosser
for me, while I finish my other one.  The catch?  I need to realign my assets to
afford the purchase.

So, first on the chopping block (maybe more to come) - I have a 24' enclosed
trailer, (worth $10,000 when I bought it new in '91) which I need to turn into
liquid cash.  Many features:  Tandem axle, weighs 2,000 lbs empty, white,
diamond brite front stone protector, double tongue jack (1 stationary & 1
rolls), cantilevered beaver tail (a child can lift it up and down), side door,
roof vent, interior lighting wiring, D-strap tie down system, electric brakes
w/battery back up, low mileage, and pulls like a dream.  Electric winch w/remote
control available at extra cost.

Anyone interested?  First $5,000 takes it.  Needs one of the 4 electric brake
assemblies fixed (I'll explain), a small bit of wiring harness re-connection,
and a good bath (sitting under one of my pecan trees right now).
Call/write/post for realistic details.  I'm out of vacation so I can't deliver
right now.
