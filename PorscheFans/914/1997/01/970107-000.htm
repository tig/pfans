Until recently I also believed the way to pass was to lean until it 
almost won't run.  It turns out that the lean mixture results in 
unburned, or half-burned oxygen - CO.  You have to be near stoich for 
ideal emissions.  Too lean, you get CO; too rich, you get unburned gas 
- HC.  If you have both high CO and HC, then it is too lean and 
misfiring.

You can richen the mixture most easily by putting a 500 ohm 
potentiometer (rheostat, really) in series with the Cyl Head Temp 
sensor.  You can go lean by reducing fuel pressure.  I would set it up 
by ear, then pay a gas station for 20 minutes playing while their 
machine reads out the numbers.  At too lean, the rpm hunts up and down.
Get it just richer than that.

Let us know your findings.
