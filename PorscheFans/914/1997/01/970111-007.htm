While I was under my car one day (a not unusual situation), I decided to
pull off that "mystery" cover on my steering rack. I had read that the
rack was lubed for life, but I never believe that kind of talk. After I
got the plastic plunger and spring out, it looked pretty dry in there, so
I packed a bunch of grease into the rack, using the plastic plunger as a
"motivator." I got about three plungerfuls in there, and the steering
seemed easier than before. I had both front wheels jacked up, and I turned
from lock to lock after each plungerful, to help distribute the grease. I
used a general purpose synthetic grease. The purpose of the spring and
plunger is to eliminate backlash in the rack and pinion as they wear.
Thought I'd pass along a little tidbit for everyone.
