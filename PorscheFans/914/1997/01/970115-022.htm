Stephen Jacobs asks what the original 6-GT engine lid looked like. In 1972 I
visited the Porsche Racing Parts warehouse located in Korntal near
Zuffenhausen. What a goodie store! I purchased a 6-GT engine lid which I
carried home as carry-on baggage. It was on my 70 914-6 [#466] when I sold it
in 1983. The frame, as I recall, had a longitudinal cross brace at the mid
point with an angled brace from corner to corner. The grille was indeed a
VERY lightweight hexagon mesh screen completely unlike the stock lid. The
edges of the screen were not bent over the edge but were just sheared off the
edges, maybe with a tinsnips, leaving sharp points of the mesh in places. It
was secured with tiny sheet metal screws with captive washers under the
heads. There was no longitudinal divider on top such as I have seen on some
bogus 6-GT lids. The whole thing was painted satin black. It was so light
that it was necessary to put a hand on it before pulling the release knob.
Otherwise it would slam into the top of the roll bar. I foolishly let it go
with the car. So, the original lid, Signal orange and in concours condition,
hangs on my garage wall as a piece of art.
