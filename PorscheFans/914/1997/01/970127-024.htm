Tim,

I use A-008RS's on my non-porsche mid engine track car.
I have been told that the proper pressure is 
about 27-28 pounds hot for track/autocross use.
and to run about 32 cold on the street.
The best way to get this pressure is start a little
high and take pressures right after each run and
bleed to 27-28 lbs. I am sure you will get several answer
to this ? and you really have to try different pressures 
and see what works with your driving and setup.
Hope this helps a little.
Vinnie
