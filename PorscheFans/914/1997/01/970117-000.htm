I finally had a chance to look at this car.  It took me about 5 minutes 
to decide against purchasing it because it appeared to have serious 
rust problems.  I say "appeared" because it was difficult to get a 
good look at the car's underside due to the low ground clearance 
and the flat tires -- I could only get a side view.

The car's VIN indicated it was a genuine 1970 914-6 (not a 1971).
The body panels were in good shape with only minor rust around the
trim.  The front bumper and trim had been removed; I didn't check
the back.  The car had 5-bolt Fuchs in fair shape.  It looked like
many of the gauges were removed from the dash.  The side windows had
been left rolled down and the interior looked rough.

The engine had the trademark triple-throated carbs.  There were a
bunch of leaves and other crud sitting on top of it.  Looking under
the car, I spotted what appeared to be the heat exchangers; they did
not look rusted.

There were rust flakes all over the underside, especially around the
edges where the metal turned a corner. This was the first time I had
ever seen the underside of a 914, so it was difficult for me to tell
what was supposed to be the normal outlines of the belly.

I spotted a fist-sized jagged gash on the car's underside, on the
passenger side just ahead of the firewall.  I assume this was part
of the inner rocker panel.  There were rusted flakes lining the edges
of the gash.  I couldn't see up inside the hole, but I could feel inside.

The battery tray was rust-perforated and flexible enough so that I could
bend it slightly.  I looked underneath and didn't see any major rust damage.

There was another jagged hole on the underside of the car, located directly
below the center of the hood.  There appeared to be a plastic/vinyl undertray
there, with this jagged hole right in the middle of it.  Weird.   I lifted
up the hood, and noticed a peanut-sized rust hole where the driver's side
A-pillar met the body.

I mentioned the apparent rust problems to the seller, and he didn't disagree
with me.

If any Pfan wants to contact the seller, let me know, and I will pass on
his phone number.  He said he was "hoping to get $2500" for the car.  The
car is located in Austin, TX, right where I am.

Thanks to Stephen Jacobs and others who responded to my original posting 
and gave me advice.
