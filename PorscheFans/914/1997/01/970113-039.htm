John Cullen Jr.asked for ideas why he was having altenator noises on still
the third installed altenator on his 914/6:.

Currently the alternator has a click and ringing bang, motor running. 
Not much of a noise at idle, but frantic at 2000-3000 rpm, like the fan
is hitting the housing.  Idea's anyone?  Does you have an idea or know
the best way to tell if I have lined up the housing on the dowel pin? 
I'm used to 911's on the stand, not a backward blind job like a sixer. 
A second note is the rebuilder claims to have used 'delco' bearings.  I
am suspect, but hoping someone has an idea what the noise is.  I tried
making the band on the housing tighter, looser.  I tighten the belt.  My
next step is to loosen the belt.  After that I'll try loosening and
relocating the housing.  Idea's?

John,
I am going to give you a wild guess. I have never had this problem with a
914, however from your description, I would say that one of the pulleys,
that the belt rides in, is wallered out of round and will create exactly the
noise that you describe. If you will put an indicator on the pulleys face,
this will verify any runout. Just remove the belt and turn by hand and watch
the indicator.

This information is good for any pulley that revolves on a 914  or anything
else for that matter.

Hope it is as simple as what I describe. The installation of three different
altenators with the same symptoms is saying it is not the alternators.
