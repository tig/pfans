     Hi 914 PorscheFans
     I'm not a member of these lists but have read through most of the 
     archived messages (thanks to whoever set everything up, its a GREAT 
     job you've done) on the 914s and also Tim's 914 webpage and Renegade 
     914 webpage. Have read the 914 FAQ v2.5. Anyway I talked to an owner 
     this weekend with:
     72 914 5spd 120K on original engine, 1 cylinder is weak on 
     compression, last 2 years stored, started every month and run till 
     warm. Car is on 3rd tranny (2nd lasted a couple thousand miles, bad 
     rebuild?). He claims his brother bought it new in 72 and they've got 
     most of the records. He said that only in the last couple of months 
     has it not be in a garage or carport. This is a SoCal car, not too 
     close to the beach, the red paint is shot, but there is no rust. Right 
     front fender is dented, otherwise only usual dings. Battary is dead so 
     it wasn't running but he was going to do something about it.
     
     So it sounds pretty good but.... 2 year old registration, no smog and 
     SMOG II is now in effect. Anbody deal with California DMV recently on 
     cars out of registration?
     
     The owner wasn't aware he's supposed to supply smog cert, and do these 
     914s pass the 2500rpm test?
     
     What would be a reasonable price for a car like this? If it runs and 
     appears rust free.
     
     Beside the 230# passenger test, and a flash light whats the best way 
     to check for rust?  (I've never worked on a 914 so I'm not confident 
     on pulling the rocker, heck even opening the hood(trunk?) to look at 
     the battary tray).
     
     Yes I know, 1.7 engine with a tail shifter, not too many creature 
     comforts. But would this be an ok car for a 17yr old, relativly mature 
     girl?
     
     Please CC me on the reply at jcowan@microcadam.com
     
     TIA
