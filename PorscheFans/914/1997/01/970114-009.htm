	To All.

I got the invoice for the books last night, given that there is no other 
fees added by Post office here on the inbound side. I will be sending 
E-Bills this week. I have checked with PO and they will send the books 
out 2nd day for about $4. So I will put togetter a bill which lets you 
pick the method to ship, then you can include it with $ to me and thats 
the path I will take. 

Funy the 2nd day mail has its own box, and UPS ground will require a box.
