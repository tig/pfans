Hey guys

With all this discussion on converting a 914-4 to a 6 I thought I'd post this.
I met this person at a tech session last sunday and discussed his car at
length.  If you want a six, call him for the real thing.  I have not seen it
but it sounds very nice.  This was postes on the NER region website
http://www.PorscheNet.com/themart.html.  Hope this helps someone out.

'70 914-6: 2.2E engine and sideshift trans. Nice car no rust, approx 80K miles,
silver with black int. Has 15" fuchs wheels with
5 year old semperit tires which have less than 3500 miles in that time. 2.2
engine has less than 3000 miles after rebuild. Original engine ran fine, no
smoke or anything strange, I just wanted to save it and get more power.
Original gearbox also workrd well.  Car had new clutch with engine swap. Car
never had any 'real' rust but there are a few spots on the drivers floor. These
are very minor and do not require any surgery. Car is nice and clean, paint is
about 5-6 years and in nice condition, had bare metal repaint after some fender
bending.Looking for $10,000 firm or trade toward a 944S, I need a backseat now!
