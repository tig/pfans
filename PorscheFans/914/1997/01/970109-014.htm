Hi,

Last year I bought a 72 914-4 with a 1.8 in it.
The battery tray was falling off so I took the battery and the tray out.
There is some rust beneath the tray and along the inside arm.

The battery tray was just sort of screwed in (with wood screws!) to the metal.
I am wondering how I should fix this.

Should I get a new tray and try to bolt it to the inside wall?
Or should it be welded? I don't have any welding experience. Is this something 
an amateur could do?

What about the rust damage that already exists?
Is there any way this can be repaired at reasonable cost?

The car is in good shape with minimal rust for a 25 year old.

Thanks for your input.
Guy Eddon
