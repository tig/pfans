For those of you that have expressed an interest, the Delco battery
info is as follows:
Part #   42-50
Desc: 1981203
List price : $61.23    I paid  $44.71       (in 1995)  
(it often pays off to ask for a lower price)

Not sure what the exact amp rating is, I have a cover over mine
which is kind of a pain in the rear to remove.
I have a 2.0 high compression motor which it has no trouble turning over.

I contacted our local Delco distributor (see Yellow pages) to order the
battery for me.
No one stocks this model in our area.  If that paticular model doesn't
have the amp rating you think you want, the Delco rep can probably find
one with a higher rating.  The criticle part is finding one with the correct
dimensions.
The last one I got like this lasted over 6 years, not bad for a 4 year
battery.
I particularly like this brand because it seems to handle the heat in the
engine
compartment without any acid leaks out of the battery vents. I have had NO
acid
problems using this battery combined with a cover. (I had used other battery
brands
before that caused problems even with a cover.)

If your battery is sluggish, you may just want to clean ALL the connections
first to see if that helps. This would include NEG to body connection,
connections to the starter, and transmission ground strap.
The transmission ground strap is very important! After my rebuild last
year the ground strap was not re-usable due to age etc... So we tried to
start the car for the first run with-out a new strap. It would barely
turn-over.
So I went out to autozone and got a generic 8 guage plastic coated wire with
bolt connectors at each end. Works like a charm and enables the starter to
turn faster.
