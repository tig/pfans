If you've never adjusted the 'venting clearance' on your rear brakes, this 
may be where you need to look.  After installing a new 19mm master cylinder 
and extensively bleeding my system, my pedal didn't feel any different than 
before I started.  After trying several things, I finally broke down and 
figured out how to adjust the rear brakes.  Upon completion, my pedal felt 
really solid.

I had previously done the adjustment for the outside pads, but it was the 
inside that was WAY out.  Pain in the butt to do (I had to take the calipers 
off the car get the plugs out - recommend having a pair of replacement plugs 
to put back in), but was worth the time/trouble.

Just my opinion
