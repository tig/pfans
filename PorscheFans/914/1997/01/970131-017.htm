Subject: Fuel Injectors...AAARRRGGGHHH!
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit


  Now, the questions...  Has anyone else used carburettor cleaner on 
their injectors?  Were you sucessful?  Are there any plastic parts inside 
that coud be ruined by the witch's brew that passes for carb cleaner?   
If the carb cleaner is responsible for the problem, why did it affect only 
two of the four injectors; they all had the same treatment?  Has anyone 
else had an injector go bad just sitting around?  Is water intrusion a 
possible culprit?  (No signs of rust or water on the nozzle tips of the 
bloody things.)

  Any comments would be appreciated.

			Thanks in Advance,
			Jim T.

	I cleaned out my injectors with spray can carb cleaner
	when I replaced the hoses last year.  I had the same thing happen
	upon start up.  Car started, ran like crap, turned out one
	bank was dead.  Solution was easier though.  I just had to
make up the electrical connectors.

	I had to use a bpwer source too, but mine was just a 1.5 volt
	battery.  I know there are resistors in line with the solenoid
and they are not continuous duty so I used the smallest voltage that
	would just make it work.  ALso I reinstalled them in the car
and ran gasoline through them right away.  No problems once
I remembered to plug them all in.
