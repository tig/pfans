Jeffrey Canaday <canadayj@gol.com> wrote something, and I responded 
with a message explaining the folly of trying to get a lot of roll 
resistance from springs alone.

Jeff replies:

Jeff:

Sorry... As you said, I read your response out of context and thought
you were answering a different question.  Thanks for clarifying.

You're right about the proportional-rate-increase thing, but -- and I 
think you alluded to this in your last message -- in the real world, 
Barry probably WILL need to adjust his swaybars to compensate for 
changes brought on by the stiffer rear springs and front torsion 
bars.

Changing springs will usually move the car's rear roll center, since
the stiffer springs aren't likely to have the same installed height
as the stock ones.

Lowering the car and/or corner-balancing it will also move the roll
centers, of course, and whenever the roll centers move, the
swaybars' effect on chassis roll will change.
