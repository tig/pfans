P-Fans........I an attemp not to sound too negative I would like to respond
to the posting by Jason Sneed on the 914 Owners Association Convention.  I am
a long time 914 enthusiest and PAST member of the 914 Owners Association.  My
involvement with the 914 has been a 17 year love affair with a very
unappreciated (present audience excluded) and wonderfully designed,
affordable roadster.
The commercial influence and lack of attention to MEMBERS provided by Dennis
Deeds and his organization are what drive my response.  To say I am surprised
that AA has involvement with the organization and preparation of this event
would be untrue.  Without trying to slam AA here and with no intention of
belittleing a gathering of 914 folks or the organizational work Jason is
doing, my complaint is this is a continuation of "Business" as usual for the
OA.  
Dennis, pay attention to the members.  They are more than dues and a venue
for revenue.  The OA is a captive group of very unique automotive
enthusiests.  You should be commited to all members of the OA, giving them a
reasonable amount of attention when requested.  If you feel you are living up
to this expectation you might consider doing a survey of past members.
My intent, here, is to try to point out the club is a member organization not
the club owner's business venture.      
In closeing, I will add that I am glad the event is being held in a new area
and hope all that attend will enjoy the 914s and commaradarie of their fellow
914 owners and fans.  As a 914 owner in Texas, previously from Minnesota, a
centrally located event is long overdue.
