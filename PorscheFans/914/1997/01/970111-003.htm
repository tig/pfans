Here's the other.

As I remember, the important number is total drag, which is the 
Coefficient of Drag times the frontal area.  True?
The 914 really shines in small frontal area.

umm, well getting back to the first time I posted something to
p-philes. The English Autocar magazine tested a 914-6 in (I think)
November 1970, and in the same issue was a cutaway drawing of
the 914-4. The text said that the car has a low Cd due to an
exceptionally clean shape - i.e. very few things sticking out into
the airstream. As implied in recent postings, Cd is independent
of frontal area - it's related to shape, and this is why wind-
tunnel testing of models can be scaled to real cars and aircraft.

Up to 18 months ago I worked in a CFD (Computational Fluid
Dynamics) environment, so though I'm no aero engineer I'll try
to offer some hopefully valid data from the memory banks:

The coefficients and Lift and Drag (Cl and Cd) characterise the
forces on a body in an airstream (strictly speaking, any fluid).
They are non-dimensional - all the units cancel out - but I can't
remember the equations. Both numbers are obtained by integrating
the forces on the body over its surface. Cl is obtained from the
components of the force at 90 degrees to the air flow, and Cd
from the force components parallel to the air flow. This means
that a "pointy" shape like the front of a 911 need not be any
better than the blunt front of a 914 - you have to add up 
smaller drag forces but over a larger area on the 911.

I think the key thing is one doesn't want to lose energy in
disturbing the air (and see it all get wasted in turbulence),
and in general one can avoid this as long as the air sticks
to the vehicle's surface. If the front of a 914 is sufficiently
rounded, there will be no problem & there is no benefit from
further rounding. The ideal shape is apparently something like
a Zeppelin - hemispherical-type front and tapered afterbody with
a length-to-width ratio of 6:1. Tapering the afterbody more rapidly
can lead to separation, where the airstream unsticks from the 
surface of the vehicle or wing resulting in major-league turbulence. 
IMHO this is the 911's big aerodynamic problem and the reason
why the 2.7 RS Carrera's ducktail spoiler was worth an extra
4 MPH - the spoiler serves to control the turbulence.

A professor Kamm determined that the most efficient way of
designing a body of realistic length was use the "teardrop" shape
and chop it off once the required length had been obtained. This
means that the blunt back of the 914 (and even that of its
cockpit) may not be such a bad idea.

The 356 isn't chopped off at the rear, but the gradual taper 
ends quite far back. The shape is very smooth and especially on the
ones with low headlights there is little to "trip" the airflow.

The above "facts" on aerodynamic drag do need checking, but 
hopefully will serve to explain the 914's low Cd. I haven't 
posted this to the list - you're welcome do so if it's 
appropriate and I haven't mangled too many facts.
