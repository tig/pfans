You have a 1974!  Aren't you lucky!

The reason I say this:  The '74 has an extra, extra starter motor relay.

It's under the passenger seat.

And the relay panel under the seat is probably full of shmutz.

Mine gave me nothing but grief.  Like the time it decided not
to work on the approach to the Caldecott tunnel during rush
hour.  (bump started it rolling backwards downhill on
the median....)
