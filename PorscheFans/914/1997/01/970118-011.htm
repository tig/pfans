The front bumper was gone from this car.  There might have been
a lot of other stuff that was missing; I didn't look very hard.

I remember reading an Excellence article about a guy who stripped
off the parts from a 914-6 and made it into a track car, and then
sold the parts.  He bought the car for $3k and came out ahead from 
just selling the parts.
