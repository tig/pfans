Are you certain it's an exhaust smell? It could very well be burning
dust if your heat hasn't been used in a while. Possibly oil as well.

Do you mean you replaced the heat exchangers? Or just the heater ducting
under the engine. If you have new heat exchangers then maybe you're just
burning off the coating. If the heat exchangers are old, maybe they've
now rusted through and if so, REPLACE THEM IMEDIATELY.

Aha! What you are smelling is the Powder coating of the collector
burning off. This will last for a while untill the powder coating is
gone. Happened to me too.

Not likely, not unless they did any welding. Which they should not have
done under any circumstance.
