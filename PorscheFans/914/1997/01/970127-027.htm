Two or three years ago my starter had the same symptoms. I did just as
you suggest, pull the starter and re-pack the solenoid with grease. I
also greased up the "spiral drive" (the part the sonenoid pushes against
on the starter). It has not failed once since I greased it. I hope this
works for you, too.
