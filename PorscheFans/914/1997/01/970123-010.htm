	Archie asked about putting a 76 2.0 powertrain into his 72 1.7.
Gary had some good comments, but did forget about one or two things.
It looks like someone pointed out one or two of 'em, but it was difficult
to tell.
	Anyway, the 76 motor (+ brain, etc.) should bolt right up to the
72 car and tranny.  The late-style fuel pump isn't needed, but if you can
install it correctly, can be a "nice to have".  You'd want the older-style
engine mount bar and probably the bits that connect the bar to the motor.
	If you want to put a side-shifter tranny in as well, you'll need
the late-style (curvy) motor mount bar.  Also the rubber mounts that go
between the motor and bar, and maybe the brackets bolted onto the motor
that those rubber mounts attatch to.  You'll also need the metal brackets
that attatch the outside ends of the bar to the car.
	At the very least, you'll need the "rear shift rod" from the newer
car.  That's the curved one that goes from the firewall to the tranny.  I
think some of the mail-order outfits sell adaptors for the early-style
front shift rods to the late-style rear rods.  However, it would be cleaner
to get the whole shifter mechanism from the later car.  I don't know if the
gearshift lever itself is different, but (from looking at the diagrams in
the Haynes book) just about everything else is.
	On the later car, this means pulling up the carpet over the shifter,
loosening the bolt on the coupler (as if you were gonna adjust the linkage)
and hopefully just pulling the rear rod out into the engine compartment.
The early car is probably more involved--it looks like there are more pieces.

	One note:  If Archie is in California, or somewhere else where they
check engine serial numbers, he will have to keep all the smog stuff that
was on the car originally.  Or rather, he will need all the stuff that is in
the Smog Person's Big Book of Equipment.  This includes all the FI stuff,
smog pump (possibly), and catalytic converter (possibly).  Remember, the new
Smog2 program seems designed to screw up people who put non-original motors
in their cars.  Check your local regs carefully.
