<< (1) I was planning on purchasing a Weltmeister unit.  Someone had
mentioned
 another that was supposedly as good quality, adjustable, and less costly.
 Since I cannot find that post, can someone enlighten me?  Also who carries
it?
 
 (2) Weltmeister also sells an "adapter kit for all 914 without thru-body
 front sway bar.  Does not require gas tank removal."
 
 My car appears to have not come with the swaybar option.  There are
 attachment flanges on the A-arms however. Does the above kit allow you to
 install the sway bar under the body without cutting?  Since I have heard
 about heavier swaybars causing cracks in the body, is this installation
 preferable? >>

Weltmeister kit goes through body.  The adapter kit that does not require
removing gas tank uses u bolts to tie in the mounts.  NOT recommended as the
sheet metal will fatigue and tear around the holes.  Best approach is to weld
in the swaybar reinforcements with the gas tank removed (not a hard job), and
do the job right.  Heavier baars only case craks if the reinforements are not
welded in.
