I have defeated the seat belt feature on the advice of Dr. 914 last year.
If I remember correctly (I'd have to look under the seat to be sure) there
are two very heavy yellow wires that enter that snake pit. I disconnected
them from the connector and then joined them together permanently. This
completely bypasses the "feature". I think this info is in the Tech Tips
book from Dr 914 (Automobile Atlanta).

BTW, I thought that book was expensive ($20 or so) but it has proven to be
worth much more than that. Chock full of great info and advice.
