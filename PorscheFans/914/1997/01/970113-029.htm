>>I was not making any accusations in regards to his current =
configuration
>>or legality. I do know he used to run a Hewland (Rally?) box and he =
still may.

Whoops, and neither was I!  Accusations no, statements yes.  And I =
assume that his configuration is no secret to anyone; at least it seems =
to be pretty common knowledge.

BTW, my understanding is that a Hewland GB is perfectly legal in a car =
which has a "real" racing history.  In Kevin's case, his car competes in =
IMSA and is therefore allowed to carry a Hewland box.  So, for that =
matter, are the "factory" 924/944GTR's.

I personally think this is a bullshit rule, since it if nothing else =
denigrates PCA Club Racing to second class status - and by PCA Club =
Racing people themselves!  It also creates a two-tier system, the top =
tier which is reserved for the more affluent who can afford a pedigreed =
racer, and the hell with the grass roots enthusiast.=20
