If it's a choice between a 3.0 six and a 350. The six wins hands down.
Here's why.

O.k. So resale maters not. That's not a factor.

Yes, chevy parts are cheaper. But the 3.0 is basically a bullet-proof
engine, and if it's cared for, it'll last quite a while.

Either engine will launch a lightweight 914 into warp speed pretty damn
quick.

The initial cost of conversion will probably cost a little more for 3.0
six than for a 350. But there are differing problems involved in each
conversion, and each have their expenses.

> 5) I don't want to destroy the handling of the car.

This is the BIG one here. The 350 weighs quite a bit more than than the
3.0 six, and will have a very noticable effect on the handling
capabilities of the car. In addition, the water cooling causes problems.
The radiator has to go somewhere in front if it's going to be usefull,
and as such you will need to remove a fair bit of sheet metal. This can
reduce the integrity of the front of the chassis. There are acceptable
ways to mount and plumb the cooling system, but it is not cheap and will
wind up shortening the lifetime of the chassis in the long run. Also the
massive torque of teh V8 will tend to twist the chassis pretty badly
unless it's reinforced somehow.

Great! If the car is gonna go fast, it's gotta stop first.

> 7) I can rebuild an engine or can afford to have one built.

The 350s are cheaper, heck you can pick one up for cheap at almost any
FLAPS.

Cool! Wish I had a setup like that. I'd never leave the garage.

Nope, keep the 901 gearbox. It'll handle up to about 250-300hp but you
do have to be carefull with first gear. Kennedy Engineering makes
adaptors for any engine to any transmission. Not a factor.

Good luck on your decision.
