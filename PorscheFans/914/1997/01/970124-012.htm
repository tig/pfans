<< 
 	Hi, all--I think my mailer's back, so I'm back on the lists!
 
 	Just to appease my curiosity, does anyone out there have a
 real 1976 1.8-liter 914?  One where the VIN starts out "47629..."?
 The only history of 914s that mentions the 1.8 that late says or
 implies that they weren't, that the 1.8 was not offered in the 76
 model year.
 	Anyone have a counter-example?  If you do, you might want
 to think about getting one of those "certificates of authenticity"
 things (Kardex?), 'cause it seems like they're even less common than
 the 76 2.0's!

In 1976 I was a sales representative at Bob Hagestad Porsche-Audi in
Lakewood, CO.  For the US 1976 model year, the 914 was only available as a
2.0 and as far as I could tell the only difference between the 1975 and the
1976 model year other than the VIN was the "914-2.0" script on the rear of
the car.  The 75 had a removeable plastic badge and the 76 had a decal.  They
were only produced for 1/2 the model year, then were replaced in the lineup
by the 924.  This was also the year of the 912E which most people in the
business at the time felt was how Porsche used up their remaining 914 2.0
engines.  (Not necessarily my opinion, so no flames please)

Having said all this, I also realize that in the world of Porsche, there is
no such thing as, "they never did that".
