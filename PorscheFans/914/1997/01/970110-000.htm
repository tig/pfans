Hi Guys
 I converted my 73 to 5 lug. I bought a 73 911S front end complete for
$275.00 (w/Alum calipers) and found a set of rear hubs already done by
Fat at a Porsche swap meet for $30 bucks. I did have some extra
exspences though. New rear bearings and I bought a set of crossed
drilled rotors from Troutman (very nice) but $400 bucks. I then shoped
around and found a full set of 16X6 Fuchs w/tires for $200 buck(gotta
love California) So its not cheap but if you have the time and can shop
around , do so. 914's look great with Fuchs....Good Luck...Don
