Greetings p-nuts,

Thanks to those of you who responded to my confusion about the damn brakes.
After I wrote the post-I thought about all this for a second and realized
that, barring something that's actually broken...sponginess=air in system
(doh). so I went ahead and did all four wheels and problem finally went
away.  took awhile though...I kept stopping too soon, and not getting ALL
the air out.

You see, I had assumed that air introduced through the front calipers would
not migrate to the rears - wrong.

So, Object Lesson;
"always bleed all four wheels (starting with the one furthest away from
m-cylinder) anytime you open ANY brake line..."

Again, thanks

Thom Kuby
