>I autocross my 2.0, and I've seen a lot of folks towing little trailers behind
their cars so they can carry their tires and other supplies. Has anyone had
any experience towing one of these with a 914?<

Yes, it will work as long as you keep the weight down.  A lot of SCCA national
class people tow, with small trailers.  I am planning on doing this myself for
the close runs.  But long hauls out comes the Astro, with trailer, and 914 in
tow.

P.O. of my Karmann Ghia used to tow a sunfish, with it.  Only big problem is
engineering the hitch with proper attachment pionts.  BTW, the KG, towed just
fine, and it has a whole 45hp.  It never set any speed records, but never got
stuck on the boot launch either.  Something that can not be said for a freinds
Toya Celica Convert, which became a swiming pool on a luanch a few years back.

I also still have the KG hitch, anybody want one.

On the same orginal thread, Trailer-X now sells a small aliuminum trailer for
this purpose, if you want to spend the bucks.
