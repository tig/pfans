	Well, it runs again.  Thanks to Dirk Bergstrom for providing the
extra nudge I needed to actually *fix* it.  Ya see, he was replacing his
rear suspension bushings and re-indexing his rear torsion bars in my
garage, so I worked on my car too...

	Item the first:
	My fuel pump problem was actually a pump wiring problem.  When I
was testing circuit continuity for the 8th or 10th time, the plastic plug
for the pump pulled off the wires.  Taking the copper connectors with it.
"Gee," says I, "maybe this is why it wasn't running so good!"  Two new
connectors later (now that I've got the ones *with* the barbs to hold them
into the plug) and that's fixed.  Still no power.  Turns out the big wire
from the battery to the relay board (#14 on the T14 connector) was bad.
So I routed another wire in its place.  It wasn't too bad removing the
little connector from the plug end, actually.  They're all soldered on, so
earlier discussions about possible corrosion may also apply to these!

	Item the second:
	Bodyshops are the living incarnation of all evil on earth.  I mean
it.  If you've found one that doesn't use half-trained chimpanzees with
sledgehammers and caulking guns, treasure them.  Keep going to them--regard-
less of cost.
	I pulled the front bumper off my car.  Why?  To replace a light bulb.
Whatever idiots did the front clip on my 914 decided not to use the "U-Speed"
nuts to hold the foglight grilles on.  They went with regular hex nuts.  And
of course you can't get a wrench on those suckers with the bumper in place,
can you?
	I went to Orchard and bought some of those U-Speed things--now I can
take the grilles off with the bumper on.
	I also found that someone had really kludged a way to put halogen
bulbs in 914 foglights.  I mean, *REALLY* kludged.  Now I have to figure out
how to replace one of them.  I think this was another body-shop thing--but
I'm starting to think that all kludges are bodyshop-related...
	Also, I found that the weld that one bodyshop did to my engine lid
bracket was REALLY REALLY AWFUL (big globs of slag, little bits of welding
rod all over--yech!) and it failed when I was putting my engine lid back on.
To my immense joy, I can tell you.
	Finally, I found that my taillight lenses had been GLUED ON TO the
body of the car.  With clear silicon sealer.  A whole lot of it.  I still
haven't got the right one off.  The left one came off in two pieces, while I
have taken two small chunks out of a corner of the right one and put a nice
scratch in the fender with my razorblade.

	I hate bodyshops.  Especially any that have worked on my car.  But
at least the car runs again.
