     Last year I bought a 72 914-4 with a 1.8 in it.
     The battery tray was falling off so I took the battery and the tray 
     out.
     There is some rust beneath the tray and along the inside arm.
     
     The battery tray was just sort of screwed in (with wood screws!) to 
     the metal.
     I am wondering how I should fix this.
     
     Should I get a new tray and try to bolt it to the inside wall?
     Or should it be welded? I don't have any welding experience. Is this 
     something 
     an amateur could do?
     
     What about the rust damage that already exists?
     Is there any way this can be repaired at reasonable cost?
     
     The car is in good shape with minimal rust for a 25 year old.
     
     ************************
     
     Battery trays frequently rust out on these cars.  That in itself is 
     not hard to fix.  The acid also gets into the frame and suspension 
     console under it however and causes rust inside.  I just got done 
     repairing the damage to mine.  I had to replace the suspension console 
     and do extensive repair to the outer support as well (where the 
     trailing arm mounts on the outside). Part of the rocker also had to be 
     replaced.  I did not replace the battery tray since I plan to move it 
     to the front trunk.  
     
     As to what you should do for your car.  The battery tray can be 
     attached with bolts, rivets, or welds.  Just make sure that you make 
     it sturdy and try to make it look as professional as possible.
     
     Now you need to stop the rust in the rest of the car under the tray 
     (lets assume that nothing needs to be cut out and replaced).  First, 
     take off the outer rocker panel and clean all the junk that has 
     collected in it.  This should be done every year or so.  There are 
     several drain holes in the frame.  Several are located along the seam 
     of the rocker panels under the car.  There is one on the bottom edge 
     of the suspension console.  These get blocked or crimped shut over the 
     years and trap water in the frame.  Clean all of these out and pry 
     them open if they have been damaged.  
     
     Any rust that you see should be removed - wire brush, power tools, 
     sand blast, chemicals, whatever.  Now coat them with a rust conversion 
     coating.  My favorites are Corrless Eastwood Company, 1-800-345-1178), 
     and POR 15.  Other people have used Extends with good luck.  It is 
     cheaper and available at almost any hardware store. These all react 
     with the remaining rust and seal the surface to keep the rust from 
     getting worse.  
     
     Now on to the rust you can't see.  The box tube formed by the rockers 
     (the outside of this box is the sill that you step over to get into 
     the car) extends over the rear axle and to the rear of the car.  You 
     should drill some holes (small as possible) into this box along the 
     length of it.  Remember that the heater tubing is just inside the 
     rocker.  Do not drill into it.  Spray water in the box and wash them 
     out until the water draining out is clean.  Let the car sit for a 
     couple of days to dry out - it is best to do this when it is hot and 
     not humid.  At this point the box may still have rust inside but will 
     be free of crud.  Now spray the conversion coating in there using a 
     nozzle with a small tube attached.  Most of the rust will be on the 
     lower part of the box.  With a little luck, you will coat most of the 
     rust. The holes that you drilled can be sealed up with caulk.  
     
     Use the same procedure on the suspension console as well - and any 
     other enclosed space in the frame.  
     
     Here are some other places to look for rust:
     
     Inside the rear fenders just above the tail light.  Foam was spayed in 
     here to "seal" it.  Over time. the foam loosens up and traps water in 
     the gap between the foam and metal and leads to rust.  This is why so 
     many 914s rust through here.  Dig the foam out, clean any rust out and 
     coat with a conversion coating.  Then coat the area with seam sealer.  
     
     Front and rear door jams - especially the rear.  The rust starts on 
     the fender side.  Clean this out and coat any rust.
     
     Inside the rear fender under the B-pillar.
     
     Lower parts of the front fenders.
     
     The pan of the passenger compartment.  Pull the rugs out and check for 
     rust.  
     
     And many more.  You get the idea.  The main thing is to keep the drain 
     holes open, coat any rust with a good rust conversion coating, and 
     keep the chassis clean.  Sorry for the lengthy note.  Hope it helps.  
     Anyone else have other approaches to this problem?  I am always 
     looking for a better way.
