So, I don't know if you guys have heard....

The California Smog people have admitted that they have the numbers wrong for
quite a lot of air cooled engines.  The engines are totally incapable of
matching the numbers the state published.  While the state figures out the
new numbers, anyone with a car that falls into the categories the state 
recognizes as having a problem, are supposed to go to a referee and they're
supposed to know about this and make it okay (I'll believe that when I see it).
The Golden Gate Region PCA newsletter printed a list.  I know older 911's were
on it.  I think the 914's are also.  Check it out before you spin your wheels
for too long.
