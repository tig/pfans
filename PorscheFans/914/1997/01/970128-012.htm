  I remember seeing that article.  It wasn't a step by step instruction.  I
  remember the end (near gas tank?) of the lines needed to be curved to
  feed out.  Do you feed them in from the front or from the back?  If back
  does the engine have to be removed?   Haven't been under my car since
  just got it and been raining since,  finally a clear day today.

   What size lines should be used, what fits.  I'd like to eventually
  replace mine with stainless.  What about the ends?  Don't recall, do they
  need to be flared for metal?

Jim Pasha - wrote an article in one of the past issues Excellence.  But the
jist is you replace the lines with a hardline, like steel, or my favorite
Stainless Steel.  It is not an easy job, but can be done in a day.  And
sorry I don't remember the exact issue.  I would not go back to plastic,
unless I wanted my car to be 100 points concours, but even then I might
opt. to take the deduction and keep the car.  But then, that is just me,
and the plastic lines have been around along time, and there inlays the
problem.
