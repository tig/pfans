For Jay Laifman and possibly others:

  The heads that Jay is describing sound like 2.0 litre heads; so far as I 
know, only the 2.0 litre heads have three-bolt intake runners.  I believe 
that 1.7 and 1.8 litre heads have 4-bolt intake runners.  Anyone out 
there care to set both of us straight?

  As regards to year, '75 and '76 heads will have holes drilled into the 
exhaust ports from the outside surface of the head; this is to 
accomodate air injection from a smog pump.  '74 and earlier heads do 
not have these holes.
  If you are not sure if the heads are even 914, that gets a bit trickier, 
but if you punch up Stoddard's web page (http://www.stoddard.com/) 
they have a part number search page.  Try searching on the part 
number on the head.  If that doesn't work,  you might call Automobile 
Atlanta or Automotion and see what they say about the part number on 
the head.
  The following numbers are from the Automobile Atlanta Catalog; I 
don't know how well they will correspond to actual Porsche/VW part 
numbers, as there are different numbers for remanufactured and new 
heads, but if you get a match, then you are home free.

1.7 head  rebuilt  021 101 353 B
1.7 head  new     022 101 351 A
1.8 head  rebuilt  022 101 351 C
1.8 head  used    021 101 351 S
2.0 head  rebuilt  039 101 351 E
2.0 head  used    039 101 351 G

  Apparantly, the 1.8 and 2.0 heads are no longer available new, at 
least as far as Automobile Atlanta is concerned.  Performance Products 
in Van Nuys, CA lists new 914 2.0 heads at almost 1k$ apiece, but 
does not give a part number.

  I hope that this is of some help.  If all else fails, try sending your heads 
off to a reliable machine shop that specializes in Porsche... I can supply 
a name if you like.  They can almost certainly I.D. them for you.

				Good Luck,
				Jim T.
