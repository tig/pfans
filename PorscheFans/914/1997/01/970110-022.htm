Thanks to all who have responded to the CR increase question.  The long and
short of it is that I can't afford the Euro P&C's at this point, so I've
decided to do nothing for now.  I'll save the radical changes for my next
motor.  And you're right, I have serious reservations of someone cutting
into my heads!

Thanks again,

Dion
