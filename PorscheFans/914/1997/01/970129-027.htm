Very good point. My knowledge of the update came from a Porsche
dealership and they told me that the update was new elbows and (yes) a
battery cover. Thanks for reminding me that the cover was part of the
package.

After reading all of the notes about this I now know more that I did
before. So I guess that I don't have any thing left to replace. Gel
battery, and new rubber fuel lines all the way around.
