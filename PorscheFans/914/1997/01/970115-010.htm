In a message from Jeff Brubaker to Stephen Jacobs on 1-14-97, regarding 914-6GT
mesh materials, Jeff wrties, "Hi my friend Gary Wigglesworth owns a factory GT,
I have a number of photos of his car but I don't think any have enough detal of
the lid to be useful to you.  If you wish you could call him at 717-846-1885 in
York Pennsylvania.  He runs a P-car repair shop and would be useful as a
resource."

Here's my thoughts:  Jeff's post sparked me to go look at my photo collection
too.  I lived in Baltimore, MD from '88 to '91 and had many occassions to see
the Wigglesworth's '6s (the GT that Jeff speaks of and the pure racing one they
bought from Bauer Porsche).  I looked at my pics and I'm afraid that they aren't
any better than Jeff's.  There was also a fellow there who had a deep blue
colored sixer with flares, who would run at Harrisburg, Hershey and the
once-a-year invitational at York, but not with the same frequency as the
Wigglesworths.  The pics I have of his are almost as unclear, but I strain and
it looks more like a hexagonal design.  However, I wouldn't lay my life on the
line judging that one.

Sorry I couldn't be of more help.  If Jeff's suggestion to call the Gary's
doesn't pan out, try Stoddard's in Ohio, or George Hussey at Automobile Atlanta.
