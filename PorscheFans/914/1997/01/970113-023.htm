3rd tranny?  That's kind of odd.  It may have had a bogus re-build;
that would indicate that the car was maintained by a 'bug' person.

It's not a "good" thing to have the car worked on by someone who
thinks 914's are "just another type-IV".  Check the records.

"Wasn't aware..."  Yeah, RIGHT!  It's probably been sitting *because*
it wouldn't pass smog.  And because of "bug" maintenance, it will be
a task to get it to pass.  (Mayby)

The standards are easier for the "pre-75" cars.  If it's running
right, and all of the hoses are in the right spot, it should
pass.  I have to take mine to someone who knows what he's doing,
the local "smug-pros" can't do it.

Depends on the results of the smog test.  If it passes, and there
really is no rust, $1500 -> 2K.

The lid opens with the knob by the drivers left hip.  Look under
and around the battery, not just the tray.  Imagine you are water
flowing over the battery; where would you go?  There's the rust...

Is daddy ready to work on it?  Any 20+ year old car is going to
need work.  On the plus side, the 914 is a cool car, handles well,
pretty safe in accidents, and:  Despite the Porsche logo, it's NOT
a fast car.

Besides a heater and windshield wipers, what creature comforts
are needed?  My Healy didn't have either, and I still drove it.
