    Jebby:

    Yeah... It's certainly a better idea than a tea-tray behind and
    level with the top of the rear deck.

    On the other hand, it's likely to cost a LOT of money to design
    and build a wing like the one you're considering.  And you'll
    need some serious work at the front of the car to balance it.

    By the way, if you're really serious about getting the BEST
    performance out of your wing, you'll want it to mount directly to
    the rear suspension BELOW the springs, so you won't be forced to
    run insanely-stiff springs to keep the suspension from bottoming
    out (and the wheel camber from being affected) at speed.

    You'll also want it to automatically adjust for vehicle speed...
    Doing this means that you can dispense with a lot of the
    high-tech multi-element silliness and use a much simpler wing.

    Both of these things, of course, are banned by all sanctioning
    bodies of whose rules I'm aware.

    You can save some expense and trouble by performing your tests
    using drops of water-based paint... Some experimentation with
    application methods and paint viscosity will be necessary, and
    you'll have to limit your testing to days when the weather's
    relatively cool, but you won't need a chase car and video camera,
    since the airflow patterns over the car will remain visible
    until you wash the paint off the car.

    Are you talking about getting air into the engine bay after
    you've enclosed the back of the car with an aerodynamic cover
    from the rear of the roof down to the trunk?

    If so, I think that a low but full-width scoop across the roof
    will work a lot better; NACA ducts are likely to be pretty
    inefficient back there, since the boundary layer's likely to
    be pretty thick at that point.

    P.S.  The cone in your signature is misaligned... On my system,
          it looks like:
