Greetings P-nuts,

Seems that I'm having a bad-hair day with these brakes of mine.

After rebuilding both front calipers  with kits from GPR, I re-installed
them back on car and bled...
- I used the classic, two-man "pump, down, up" routine which in the past
has given me excellent results.
- I also worked both upper and lower bleed valves on each caliper
- I kept the resevoir full at all times

My problem is, after what seems to be a long bleeding session on both
calipers (with what appears to be solid fluid discharge), the pedal doesn't
get any firmer...I even went to the master cylinder and cracked open the
front line (only) and bled it- but no difference in pedal feel.

Am I missing something here?  I have NOT TOUCHED anything related to the
rear brakes.  I looked for leaks, didn't find any (yet)

any thoughts folks?
I could use the assistance here...(my cars are all croaking at once-a
rather sticky wicket eh?)

Thanks loads
Thom Kuby
