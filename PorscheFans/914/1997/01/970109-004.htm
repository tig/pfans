Has anyone seen, or does anyone have, conclusive wind tunnel photographs, and
attendant statistical data to accompany the photos, on our beloved 914?  I'm
wanting to confirm reality about my 914's aerodynamics before I go out and spend
the bucks for an aerodynamic device that's a stylistic-good-looker but is
truthfully dysfunctional trash.

I've heard some bench racing "stories", but I haven't seen the wind tunnel
proof.  Stories like why they put that audacious-at-the-time spoiler off the
back of Walt Maas' Garretson/Automotion/Carlsen Porsche-Audi  IMSA GT car (that
sounds like the words that come out of the mouths of winners these days, when
they get in front of a TV camera :-]  ), or why people are putting these
humongous airfoils off the back.  I've also noticed the trend to utilize the '75
style nose (by fiberglass purveyors like A.I.R.) because it gives a little more
slope and a little less frontal space, but I wonder if drag is really reduced.
I have felt the effect of putting a dam on the front and what it does for
directional stability, but I'd like to see conclusive evidence.

"Big" or "Different" doesn't necessarily mean it really "works" (remember the
recent addition that Ron Dennis/McLaren made of a third wing atop the air scoop
and minuscule cockpit for Nigel Mansell? - the car was in truth an aerodynamic
bomb).  The 914 trickery we've seen could all be just a big "drag" (pun
intended).  For instance, that beautiful white and confetti colored 914 with
huge rear wing, that won at the PCA Parade this year, could be just that,
pleasing to the eye, but an aerodynamic blunder.  Is there measured/photo
documented proof around for the rest of us to access?  I'd love to just see a
simple airflow photo set too, if anyone has such (especially curious about the
roll bar area).  I'd also love to see comparative data about alternate placement
of devices (up high, down low, way off the back, up close), and what drag,
reduction of drag, and lift they create.  I have my technical journals about
vehicle aerodynamics in general, but I'd like to see it specifically relating to
our beloved 914.

Maybe someone on here works for, or is connected with, NASA Langley and could
somehow borrow some time to do a simple photo shoot in their tunnel : - )  When
I lived there, we (PCA & SCCA) used to autocross in the parking field right in
front of that behemoth, and I always wanted to get inside.  Never did : - (

The only thing I remember seeing was a short piece in Panorama, over ten years
ago.  I believe that it was factory aero drag info about comparisons of top
on-windows up, top on-windows down, top off -windows up, top off-windows down,
one window up, one window down etc. etc., and I believe it included the 911
Targa in the comparison. 

All info will be appreciated.
