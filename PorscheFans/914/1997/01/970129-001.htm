For Dirk Wright, and others who might be interested in my low 
humor...

Hi Dirk!

  You wrote:

"   So, once I throughly de-grease the outside of the case,   "

  Please let me know how you do this... When I had my tranny out of 
the car, I must have used half of the Gunk in town on it, and I never 
did get all the crud off.

"   I was thinking either lime green or bright yellow.  "

  Your project brought to mind a humorous picture from my miss-spent 
youth...

  I was driving down State street in Santa Barbara, when I pulled up 
behind a '57 Ford Fairlane that had been turned into a street rod with 
loving care.  The car was perfectly clean, not a speck of dirt 
anywhere.  I could see this because the owner had reversed the rear 
springs, or put in extra-long links, or whatever they do, and the rear of 
the car was at least four feet in the air.  High enough to let me see 
that the whole underside of the car was meticulously clean and 
painted, and high enough to let me observe the rear axle.  The entire 
 rear axel was painted gloss black, with a pair of beautiful gloss red 
lips on the differential cover, together with wording in white: "Kiss my 
Rear End!"

  Now, I don't suppose that modifying the suspension on a 914 in like 
manner will ever be fashionable, so no one will ever see it, and it isn't 
exactly correct to refer to a trans-axel as a "Rear End", but still, if 
you're going to paint it....

				Regards,
				Jim T.
