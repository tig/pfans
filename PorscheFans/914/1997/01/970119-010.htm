Hi fellow 914er,s

It appears the last time trail disintegrated the inside control arm busing on
the passengers side allowing movement of the arm causing the tire contact with
the body.   Everything was off last year for the welding of a chasis stiffening
kit so I have a fair idea of what I am doing but have a few questions and would
like to save a few steps if at all possible.

1. I am allowed "soft" plastic pushings as replacemnts in the class I run (BI),
If I replace the problem side with the "soft"  bushings, will it be comparable
to the other side or will I also need to do the otherside at the same time?  I
know Weltmeister sells "street" plastics which I assume is the same as "soft",
does anyone have experience with these? are there others out there that are
superior?

2. Last time the arms were off I had the heat exchangers, half shafts etc off
also so it was not hard to do, this time I am trying to save a few steps but
cannot see a way...... can I get away with leaving the heat exchangers on and
just disconecting the half shafts from the transmission and take them along with
the arms to the machine shop?         

3.  A week or so someone was talking about the grease used to install the
plastic bushing (elephant snot!), what is the real name of this lovely stuff?  

4. On an unrelated topic, my passenger side front caliper was sticking/not
retracting so I took it apart, cleaned the bore with fine emery and put it back
to gether with new seals.  It appered to fix the problem, but two events later,
it is sticking again.  The wheel turns but not as freely as I think it should.
Suggestions?
  
Thanks,

Craig Crease, 
73' 914 2.0 BI (still not smogged!)
