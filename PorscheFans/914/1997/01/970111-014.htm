Hi 914-er's!

  Larry Moeller wrote some very interesting stuff, much of which I 
intend to file for future reference, but I wish to respectfully disagree 
with one statement which he made:

  Actually,  the 914 2.0 and 1.7 litre fan timing marks are identical, 
with the exception of the 5 degree mark, which is usually missing 
from the 2.0 litre fans.  They are marked at TDC ( 0 ) and 27 degrees 
BTDC ( | ).   The 1.8 litre has only one mark, which is at 7.5 degrees 
BTDC.
  My '74 2.0 litre has the usual line scribed on the flywheel which 
aligns with the case split at TDC; I believe this is more or less 
standard for all 914's.

  Stroke,  by itself, has no effect on timing marks; all timing is done in 
angular measurement, i.e. degrees, which are independent of 
anything else.  Adding a "stroker"  kit to the engine will raise the 
compression, which will likely result in a change in timing, but  this 
change will be specified in degrees, which means a different place in 
the angular rotation diagram of the engine. 
  Hypothetically, if there were no change in timing required by 
changing the engine's stroke (let us say by reducing the compression 
at  the same time), then the timing likely would not change, and 27 
degrees would still be 27 degrees.
   Note that timing is usually specified to be at some particular RPM; 
the 5 degree mark refers to static timing, or engine not running, while 
the 27 degree mark is specified to be used at 3500 RPM.  The 
reason for advancing the timing as the engine RPM increases is 
because there is a finite time requirement for flame propagation in the 
air-fuel mixture in the cylinder.  The time is relatively constant, 
depending primarily on pressure (compression ratio).  Since the burn 
time is constant (relatively speaking), the maximum efficiency of the 
engine demands that the ignition take place earlier as the RPM 
increases.  Too late and the maximum cylinder pressure is not 
reached until the piston is well down on the power stroke, with the 
consequence that there is less mechanical work extracted from the  
burned gases, resulting in reduced power and elevated exhaust 
temperatures.  Too early, and the flame propagation speed is 
enhanced by the mixture still being compressed while burning, 
resulting not in burning, but in detonation, or "pinging".  This is rather 
hard on the engine's innards. 
   Therefore, as can be seen, timing is principally time related, which 
is a factor of engine degree position, and the time required for the 
engine to rotate through the specified degrees, or RPM.  The exact 
specification takes into account all sorts of things, including the fuel's 
resistance to detonation (octane rating), compression ratio,  air 
pollution considerations, and other things, but principally we are 
attempting to establish optimum burning TIME.
