In a message dated 97-01-29 15:29:52 EST, you write:

<< My understanding is that the 914 fuel line recall involved
 replacing the original metal fuel lines with plastic lines.
 The problem is that the fuel lines run underneath the
 battery and battery acid could drip on to and corrode
 the metal lines causing a great fire hazard.  The plastic
 replacement lines are impervious to battery acid.
 
 If you have plastic fuel lines, then your car has already
 had that recall work done to it.>>


Not true!  The campaign did NOTHING to the plastic lines.  It replaced all
cloth covered lines containing fuel on the top side of the engine with
reinforced, high pressure rubber lines.  The plastic lines were always there,
and in many cases,  are now seriously deteriorated.  I recently bought a 73
one owner 914 that the mere touching of the plastic lines in the engine
compartment crumbled them.  The heat and fuel over the years had affected
them that much.  I was a fire waiting to happen. 
If you have cloth covered lines in the engine compartment that contain fuel,
not air, then the recall has not been performed, or lines have been
incorrectly replaced since.
And there were never any metal fuel lines.  The ends of the plastic lines
near the gas tank had some metal inserts, but  the lines running the length
of the car, and the lines running from underneath the the engine compartment
to on top were always plastic.

Hope this helps clear up confusion.
