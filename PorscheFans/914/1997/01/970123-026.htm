  Just went browsing since this was suppose to be voted on on the 21st.
  This bill was to change the no smog date from pre 1966 models to "any 25
  years or older"  which would bring it up to about 1971-1972 years now,
  and it would slide forward.  Was sponsered by Senator Quentin Kopp.
  Looks like the vote was for it but don't know what the 're-referred to
  Com. on APPR' will do to it or the time frame.  Keep hoping.
