That wiring and relay is a kommon kulprit.  My '76 had it.
It can be defeated by cutting loose the two fat wires going to the 
relay and splicing them together.  Yellow/red IIRC.  That kould kure 
Kuby's komplaint.

This circuit is redundant now, what with $150 fine for driving without 
seatbelt.

BTW, my '76 has a starter glitch I need to fix when it gets bad enough.
Sometimes it cranks but the engine won't start.  Last week I hooked up 
the EFI tester, etc., and found that the EFI went dead while the engine 
was being cranked.  So did the coil.  Looked at the voltmeter below the 
dash, and saw it going to zero during cranking.  Kept trying the 
starter until volts could be seen on the meter during cranking, and 
then it fired right up.  I'm sure it's a bad switch, but it is such a 
pain to get at it, and I don't seem to have a spare..
