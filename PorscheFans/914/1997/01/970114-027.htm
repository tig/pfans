Yeah, I'm thinking that as long as everything is painted and rustproofed 
in the engine bay, then the rain catch can be removed (and stored, since 
they are expensive). Of course, this is after moving the coil forward 
onto the firewall. I noticed that the 911 coil isn't well protected from 
rain, however.

Yeah, I wanna get mine filled, but my body guy said it makes it easy to 
remove the fenders, but I don't see how a leaded seem would be a problem. 
Sure would avoid another rain/dirt/rust trap. I've seen at least one 914 
with rust in that area. I'm gonna twist his arm next time...
