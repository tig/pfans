Looking for a 73 -76 six conversion for sale preferably in Pacific   
Northwest:
 > 2.4 liter engine
 5 bolt wheels
Would like to use car on track for drivers education events.

Here's my story:  I am active in PCA-PNWR with drivers ed, and have been   
driving a 73 914 2.0 for the passed year at each of the track events.  I   
have owned 914s for 18 of the passed 23 years, I have restored 2 914s   
over that time, and have also rebuilt the engine with a friend on my   
present track car.  My plans had been to convert this 73 2.0 into a six   
(including 5 bolt wheels), but I no longer have the time for this level   
of a project (i.e. I spent too much time restoring my 74 2.0 to concours   
condition).  I don't need to buy a competed race car but I'd like to   
start with something that I can get onto the track this spring continue   
to improve upon.   Know anyone who's looking to sell one?  My preference   
is to find one within driving distance of the Seattle area.
