Yes, I think you are right.
To remove the ball joint from the strut is not an easy task. First, you
must remove the double wedge bolt from the bottom of the strut. There have
been several 911 bolts here, the original with a threaded hole in the
strut, then one with a split bottom end and a through bolt, and then the
double wedge bolt. After removing the nut and washer from the wedge bolt,
heat up the strut protecting the ball joint rubber as best you can. Then
with a proper tool, whack the bolt really hard and square and it will fly
out the other side. Mind you, that bolt is designed to wedge into the
strut, and its double wedge design fits very tightly into a v-notch in the
top of the ball joint. Remember also that the entire weight of the front
end is supported by this bolt. The front a-arms literally hang off the
bottom of the struts. the bottom line is that this bolt does not give up
easily!
Once it is removed you must coax (hah) the strut off the ball joint. This
is also difficult. You can use the cars weight to help you as it is pulling
down also. Make sure you have some wood 2x4's etc. under the a-arm so that
when it lets go it doesnt hit the ground and pin you under something. I had
best luck removing the tie rods first (also very difficult if not
impossible without a puller) and the sway bar. The latter interferes with
access to the a-arm. I used heat and a 2 pound hammer to hit downwards on
the a-arm. The strut and ball joint will give up eventually. Another reader
mentioned the ball joint tool that is shaped like a thick tapered fork. I
didn't have one and didn't know how to get it in without possible damage to
the ball joint. Another reader also commented about removing the ball joint
from the a-arm.
I did this job while converting the front of my 914 to 5-bolt, so I did not
replace the ball joints. It is a typical tough job that requires more force
than I am usually comfortable with. But in dealing with 20+ year old cars
I'm finally getting used to it. Good luck.
