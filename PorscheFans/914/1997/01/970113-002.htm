Yeah, the lid location doesn't appear to be the best, since you can't 
easily remove it to gain better access to the engine. If I were to add an 
oil cooler, I would do this: first, relocate battery in rear trunk, 
second remove battery tray and support, third obtain a cooler and a 
"pusher" fan that will fit against the wall where the battery was 
mounted, fourth cut hole in wall slightly smaller than the size of the 
cooler, fifth mount cooler on inside (engine side) of wall with "pusher" 
fan exhausting into the fender. Since I havent' done this, there are 
probably several details that I haven't recited here. A splash shield may 
have to be installed to prevent water from the rear wheel spraying into 
the engine compartment. Anyway, it's an idea.
