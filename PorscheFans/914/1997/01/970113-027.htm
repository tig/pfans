Kevin,

I was not making any accusations in regards to his current configuration
or legality. I do know he used to run a Hewland (Rally?) box and he still
may.

Although one advantage of the Hewland is the ease of which gear changes
are made, this is not one that I see as being a big deal for Buckler. He
pretty much knows what gears he needs to run at the various tracks.

Gear changes should take less time with the Hewland than with the
Porsche-based tranny. This is the big advantage. Also, availability of
gear ratios does not hurt either. He can probably setup a usable 5 speed
at some tracks and a usuable 4 speed at all others.
