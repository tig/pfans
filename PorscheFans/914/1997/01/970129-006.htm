Time for me to toss in a comment on turning rotors.

There are good reasons to turn rotors and, with a reasonably competent machine
shop, it is very effective.  Doing them because they are warped is the most
common reason, however, eight years of scaly rust would be another.  Visual
reasons would be foolish and I agree, throw away good metal.  There are very
strict limits (minimum thickness) for each rotor, for safety reasons, and all
machine shops have that data.  If you are serious about racing and use carbon
type pads, the loss of thickness may reduce heat dissipation, and you may not
like the results.  For  everyone else turning may be a very acceptable way to
stretch your dollars, especially if you have cars where the rotor price is
about 8 times the cost of turning them (84 Carrera).  If you drive hard or use
carbon type pads, insist on factory replacement (more bucks).  Many people are
finding other after-market rotors warping after a few days on the track.

  "  When looking under the car I notice there is surface rust on the
rotors.  What is the best way to clean them up temporarily?   "

  Gary Helbig has said it all... I have a 7 or 8 year accumulation on my
914, which I suppose is a worst case... I intend to do exactly as Gary
suggests... I'll let you know how it turns out.  The only caveat is that I
assume that I'll have to readjust the venting clearance after they
clean themselves up.

"   When I do the main   job I'll have them turned...  "

  My advice may be worth no more than what it costs; ask around for
other opinions, but I NEVER, NEVER turn rotors.
