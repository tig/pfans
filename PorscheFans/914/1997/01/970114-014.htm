Dirk,

The 914-6 the original filter house would interfere with the rain catcher, so
they left it out.  

I also think it may be a VW, or Karmann idea.  I base this theory of the fact
that 914-4 in Europe where sold as VWs and built on the Karmann assembly line.
Okay now, I have a 73 Karmann Ghia also, and it too has the lovely water catch
tray.  With plastic drain tubes that run down into trunk lid.  Which tend to
cause the hood to rust out in the corners, if the drain wholes gets plugged.

Now I think these lovely trays, appeared on most years of KG production, but not
on the beetle, that I know of.  So maybe it is a Karmann thing,  not a bad idea,
but does restrict air flow.  And the area that needs it the most does not have a
collection unit, ie. vent above the battery, which could be rectified.

I plan on not running them on my car, which will have a "GT" lid, but then I
don't plan on getting caught in the rain much.

A while back there was also a post on filling in the front fender to cowl beads,
I used the same rational to determine the originals seams should sealed with
lead.  This is because Karmann has / had the craftsmen that where expert at
leading seams.  The Karmann Ghia has 27 leaded joints, in its body, so these
guys knew how to use lead, and do it well.  Since the 914 was produced, by the
same craftsman, so chances are good they did it right, on those early 914-6s and
leaded the seam.  But since I know of 2 such cars in the US and one has been
restored, so I can't use it for a verification, and the other was I think
restored also.  But that is my best educated guess.
