Hi gang,

I've been (and still am!) on a long vacation and noticed some of you
are interested in doing a 914-6 conversion.

What's involved?  Lots.

Is it expensive?  Yes.

Here are the areas I've modified from the stock 914-4 in order
to get my 3.0/915 combo installed:

911 struts/brakes/master cylinder
rear stub axles/CV's
stiffer rear shocks/springs
wheels/tires/flares
motor mount
tranny mount
muffler mount
914-6 engine sheet metal
shifting mechanism
oil tank and lines
interior gauges (oil pressure/temp, tach,speedo)
throttle linkage
clutch linkage
modify 915 tranny for mid-engined use (includes speedo pickup
    for street use)
headers/muffler(s) (cable shifting needs dual mufflers - this area
    is critical for good performance - I'm still gathering info)
wiring harness changes

Each area listed above has its own headaches and problems
you've got to decide how to solve.  A lot of it depends on what
you're using in another area.  For example, don't go out and buy
a motor mount from company "A" and a tranny mount from
company "B"....they may not line up.  There are also ground
clearance issues with a "Quick-6" motor mount....some
companies make short ones, and others make tall ones.
Of course, ground clearance problems really become
apparent with low profile 15" tires.....which is what I have.
3" of ground clearance underneath my motor mount isn't
what I'd call a "good" thing - especially when a speed
bump is in front of you and a growing lineup of cars
behind you.  :-)

I can offer two pieces of advice that'll save you a lot of grief.

1)  Buy somebody else's project from hell....it'll save you a
bucket load of money.  Unless you shop around for
months and months...you'll spend thousands doing all the
things you "should" do to your conversion (brakes, suspension,
etc).

2)  Don't use the 915 tranny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Stick with the stock 914
trans unless you will be using a 300HP engine in your car.

I'll check my e-mail every few weeks until I'm back at work
so please don't get mad if you e-mail me and get no response
for a while.

Take care,

Allan
