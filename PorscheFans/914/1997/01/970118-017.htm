Brian,

	You really need to decide what you want before you buy a 914. If you're
looking for a 914-4, get a '73-74 2.0 model. If you're looking for a
914-6, I would suggest getting an already done sixer. If you want to do
it yourself, expect to spend _at least_ $10k to do the conversion. That
does not include purchase of the chassis. If you're going to do the
conversion yourself, DON'T use a 2.0! Not because it's harder or
anything, but it's a terrible shame to eliminate a 2.0 that someone else
could easilly appreciate. Use a 1.8 or 1.7 for the conversion, they're
less desireable, and they're also alot cheaper to purchase.

	So think about what you want, and how much you want to spend. That will
dictate your search criterea.
