 <<They mean the little elbow hoses that connect the injectors to the fuel
 rail. That's all. If you have new injectors, then the update in not
 neccessary. >>

NOT TRUE!!!  The elbow lines at the injectors were only part of the update.
 The hoses containing fuel on the top of the engine were also replaced with
reinforced high pressure rubber lines.  Virtually every line in the top side
of the engine compartment that contains fuel was replaced.  The battery was
also given a better cover to keep acid from splashing so much. And even new
injectors have the old style cloth covered hoses (!), so you need to keep an
eye on any new injectors.
