Hi all,

	I won't rant here much, but I just want to say that for those of you
with stated value policies with your insurance company, don't trust it.

	Stated value policies aren't worth the paper they're written on.

	I've just finished going through 2 months of battle with my insurance
company to no avail. I have come to the conclusion that stated value
policies are bunk. 

	I went through a great hassle to get my restored 914 revalued by my
insurance company, and after a minor fender crunch (front left) and the
attendant damage that went with it, my insuance company wanted to total
the car even though the estimate was far less than the stated amount.
Well, to make a long story short, I managed to get the car fixed by
scrimping here and there and going for used parts rather than new for a
sum coming close to the original estimate. My car sat for months while I
battled my insurance company to get them to fix it. GRRRRRR....

First the lawyers, _then_ the insurance goons...
