Here's my response I posted to Shane personally, about his horrifying
experience.
>>>
Shane:

Very sorry to hear of your Lipshy experience.  They do advertise in our local
regional PCA newsletter, Slipstream, once in a while, and probably do in Houston
(Lone Star) also.

More sorry to hear you lost your 1990 Carrera 2 ride.  Sounds like some lawyer
has his work cut out for him.

I believe that this should be brought to the attention of PCNA, Panorama, and
Excellence.  I'd also alert the surrounding regional PCA newsletter/clubs, plus
other marques like Volvo, BMW, Corvette, Ferarri, etc. regarding the towing
service.   Being very real-world, with NO expletives added, you point out a
serious deficiency in this particular business organization.  To threaten with
political bribery is even more despicable.

I live in Dallas, and am glad you pointed this out.  I travel to Austin to visit
one family member, and some other friends there once in a while.  I certainly
know where I WON'T go if in trouble over there.  I doubt that if I traveled to
Ohio, that Chuck Stoddard would throw around his political weight against me, if
I needed his arbitrary help, likewise Vasek Polak in California, or the Holberts
in Pennsylvania.  Those comments sure paint a highly dishonorable picture of Mr.
Lipshy, and the Porsche dealership community is sad to hear of such subterfuge.

Sincerely

Jebby
'72 914 Autocrosser
