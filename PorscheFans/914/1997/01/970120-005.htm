Greetings P-nuts,

I had heard, many moons ago, that it was possible to buy color wiring
diagrams somewhere.
These were apparently factory diagrams, sold as a supplement to the fact.
manuals?

Anybody know anything about this one?

On the other hand...is there anybody out there capable/willing to
color-copy their fact. diagrams for me?  I will cheerfully compensate you
for this effort...I am looking for '73-74 diagrams, along with whatever
detail is provided in the factory manuals about these *&^$#@ relay boards

....I guess if this doesn't work, I'll break down and get a set of fact.
manuals.  anybody know where the best price is?  I was thinking about
Carlsen's.
I know they're light-years cheaper, but I don't think I'd be interested in
fiche versions...since I write for a living, and consequently have my face
planted on a computer screen somewhere, most of the time...besides, fiche
versions aren't in color (are they?).

Any thoughts here folks?

cheers
Thom Kuby
