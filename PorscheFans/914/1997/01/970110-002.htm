I would use the euro pistons, as others have mentioned. Automotion lists
an "updated" set that supposedly have better piston top shapes for better
burn. Also, if you go cutting into the heads, you've made an essentially
permanent change to a somewhat rare part. I would certinly think twice
about that. Further, in addition to the push rod length issue, the stock
exhaust system may not fit anymore if the width of the engine as a whole
is reduced by this cutting. I don't know how much play there is in the
exhaust system, but it may be a problem.
