Hi 914-er's!

  I keep expecting Josh Hadler to jump in on these things; after all, 
he's the one who taught me how to bleed my brakes, but I'll put in my 
$.02 in absence of the master...

"  My problem is, after what seems to be a long bleeding session on 
both calipers (with what appears to be solid fluid discharge), the 
pedal doesn't get any firmer...I even went to the master cylinder and 
cracked open the front line (only) and bled it- but no difference in 
pedal feel.

Am I missing something here?  I have NOT TOUCHED anything 
related to the rear brakes.  I looked for leaks, didn't find any (yet)
any thoughts folks?  "

  I would disagree that you haven't touched anything related to the 
rear brakes.  The master cylinder is the common point between the 
two.  I know that there's supposed to be a seperation between the 
front and rear systems, but that pertains to fluid loss... air is usually 
present on the wrong side of seals and easily gets past them.  
  My best guess is that your bleeding operation has forced air from 
the front system to the rear.  The best rule of thumb when working on 
brakes is to start at the wheel furthest from the master cylinder, and 
work towards the one closest.  This means ALL four wheels, EVERY 
TIME the system is opened, NO MATTER WHERE!
  Based on my experience with an extremely recalcitrant brake 
system on my '74, you will have to run at least a pint of fluid through 
the rear system before the air that is probably trapped in the master 
cylinder even gets to the rear calipers, so even if you don't see 
bubbles at first, keep on pumpin'!

				Good Luck,
				Jim T.
