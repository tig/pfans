<< I am looking for some original photos, or personnel knowledge of early
914-6GT
 and 916 engine lids.  In specific, I have picture documentation on about 7
GTs
 and 4 916s now.  And they all use a hexagon mess grill, instead of the
factory
 diamond pattern.  Now I know this is anal, but this bugs me!  So can anyone
help
 with some early pictures or have an original lid, to verify this information
 with, please.

Hi my friend Gary Wigglesworth owns a factory GT, I have a number of 
photos of his car but I don't think any have enough detal of the lid to 
be useful to you.  If you wish you could call him at 717-846-1885 in
York Pennsylvania.  He runs a P-car repair shop and would be useful
as a resource.

Also, I purchased a GT replica lid from Doc & Cy's about 3-4 years ago.
It was made by someone who worked for them or something (memory
fading).  It was made using a very close style mesh in the same manner
the orig GT lids were made.  Unless you look at them next to each other I 
doubt you would know the difference.  You may also try to contact them
to find out if they are still available or if they can put you in touch with
the person for details.  The # is 1-800-950-0356  Good Luck & let us 
know what you find out!!
