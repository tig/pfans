I used the torch method.  You really don't need to *burn* out the
old bushings.  All you need to do is heat up the metal surrounding
the bushing.  It expands, and the old bushing twists out easily
after a few minutes...

Yes.  Although we had a different name for the grease, and it invoked
a different orifice.....
