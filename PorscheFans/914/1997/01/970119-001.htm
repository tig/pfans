I can't speak for anyone else, but I bought my car to drive, not to
sell.  I bought my /6 about 10 years ago for $5400 (what the original
owner paid for it new).  It needed a lot of work, including rust repair,
took a fair amount of money and a huge amount of time.  But I *can* tell
you

1.  I've gotten much more out of it than I ever put in, if you can put a
value on 10 years of driving and track use.

2.  I didn't buy the darn thing as an investment.

3.  Even if you figure the total sunk cost, considering that as a "new"
price, and then figuring depreciation to it's current value, it didn't
depreciate as much as most "new" cars.

4.  You can't hardly buy a new 914/6.

5. After 10 years of use, it's time to go through another "resto" cycle
(bodywork & paint), and I'll do it again in a heartbeat if I can find
the cash.

For what it's worth (bad pun intended),
