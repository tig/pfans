Hi 914-er's!

"  4. On an unrelated topic, my passenger side front caliper was 
sticking/not retracting so I took it apart, cleaned the bore with fine 
emery and put it back together with new seals.  It appered to fix the 
problem, but two events later, it is sticking again.  The wheel turns 
but not as freely as I think it should.  Suggestions?   "
  
  In looking over Porsche's explanation of how these dumb calipers 
are supposed to work, I am still scratching my head.  I think that ATE 
sold the factory a bill of goods when they contracted to build these 
brakes.  
  However, what I can glean is this:  First, they say that retraction of 
the pistons is by the elasticity of the rubber seals.  Therefore, if the 
seals have hardened up, this may be a contributing factor.
  Second, there is a brake disk deflection compensator, which 
consists of a stack of friction washers acting on a center spindle, a 
spring, and other assorted goodies.  The function of this gadget is to 
return the piston to where it was if pushed back in the bore by a 
warped brake disk, loose wheel bearing, or whatever.  It has some 
critical clearances in it to allow the normal adjustment (retraction by 
and slippage through the fluid seals) to work properly.  If this gizmo 
has developed troubles, I'd suggest, as Josh has, replace the piston.

  The whole thing seems academic, however.  Girling disks have no 
retractors, no disk deflection compensators, and no problems.  The 
pads are designed to drag on the disks.  Disk brakes, by comparison 
to drums, require much larger forces to press the friction material 
against the disk in order to achieve the same co-efficient of friction.  
The amount of friction generated by an unpressurized pad draging on 
the disk is negligible.  The 914 is the first car that I ever HEARD of 
that worries about retracting the pads from the disks.
  
				Good Luck,
