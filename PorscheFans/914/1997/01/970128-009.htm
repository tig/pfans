Dion Dunn answers

>>I don't know how the Boxster will handle, but it will be interesting at our
local autocross club this year.  We had our awards party the other night
and one of my fiance's 'friendly' competition (drives a Miata and my fiance
smokes her every time in a Neon) came up and announced that she should be
receiving her new silver Boxster at the beginning of May.

Dion, tell your fiancee to be afraid, be very afraid. I tested the Boxster
for Autoweek and it set an absolute record in our slalom test. There's never
been any other car (and we test them all) that got through the cones quicker.
