Hi 914-er's!

  "  When looking under the car I notice there is surface rust on the 
rotors.  What is the best way to clean them up temporarily?   "

  Gary Helbig has said it all... I have a 7 or 8 year accumulation on my 
914, which I suppose is a worst case... I intend to do exactly as Gary 
suggests... I'll let you know how it turns out.  The only caveat is that I 
assume that I'll have to readjust the venting clearance after they 
clean themselves up.

"   When I do the main   job I'll have them turned...  "

  My advice may be worth no more than what it costs; ask around for 
other opinions, but I NEVER, NEVER turn rotors.
  I had a Toyota truck once, when I was rich and single, and used to 
take it to the dealer for servicing.  About every 12 K miles or so, 
they'd say something like "Your rotors are looking pretty rough... you 
should let us turn them." or words to that effect.  And I said sure, go 
ahead.    About the third time they were due, the mechanic said 
"Well, they're too thin to turn again; you'll have to buy new disks."  At 
over $100. a pop, I might add.
  I then asked myself: why should I leave all that metal (read mileage) 
on the machine shop floor?  I have never turned a rotor since.  If the 
groves get really bad, the pads wear a little faster, but pads are 
cheap; rotors are expensive.  
  Back when I had my MG, it had a disk that was out of true; you 
could feel the oscillations in the pedal.  That car took me a lot of 
miles with an oscillating pedal, and still stopped so well that once 
some detroit iron had to take to the center divider to keep from 
rear-ending me in the wet.
  If you turn them, do it only in extreme cases like the one above; for 
surface roughness, forget it.  You'll save a bundle.
