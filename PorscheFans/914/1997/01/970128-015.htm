Brian,

	Stop driving the car! And disconnect the battery. That would be my
first suggestion. Step one: check for gas leaking somewhere in the
engine compartment, in and around the injectors is common. Step two:
pull the interior carpeting, and poke your nose into the tunnel. Check
for gas in the tunnel, sniff and use an inspection mirror if neccessary.
Check the hoses at the top of the gas tank and if you can, poke around
the base of the tank where the lines are. If they've never been
replaced, they might be due. If the car is a 75 or 76 then lift the
front of the car up and check for gas leaking from the fuel pump. If the
car is before 75 then look for leaks around the fuel pump (front left
lower corner of the engine compartment). That's about the extent of
where you'll find fuel leaks, that's about the whole fuel system. Of
course the evaporative lines may have come loose, but that's only vapor.
If you're smelling a strong gas smell, I'd say there's a fluid leak. Was
the smell stronger with the heat on or off?
