Well, first off .010" isn't going to get you anywhere near 8.5:1.  I 
don't have my calculations readily available, but I remember taking a lot 
more to get my compression up.  I'll work on trying to get the correct 
numbers; although my engine is a 1.8 liter and report back later tonight 
or tommorrow.

Secondly, yes you will have to take some material off of of the cylinders
also if you want to take as much as possible.  I think the "real" racers
shoot for clearence of about .030" minimum between top of piston and
bottom of valve when both close on each other.  We use clay to measure
this after assembling the cylinders and then torqueing the heads
correctly.  Yes, it takes patience and time because you almost always have
to repeat this procedure a few times to get the most out of your engine. 
For a street motor though, I wouldn't go closer than about .070". 

Joshua is correct in talking about the pushrods.  If you start taking 
toooo much off the heads and then the cylinders, you have to purchase the 
VW pushrods (racing) that allow you to make your own pushrods.  The kit 
comes with eight pieces of tubing and 16 finished ends.  After you have 
measured the correct length, then you have to cut the tubing to your 
desired length (calculated withou ends)  and then install the ends.  I 
think the stock motor comes with about .140" or so of clearence; maybe 
more.  If you don't, you will find that you probably won't be able to 
adjust the valves if more than .050" is removed.  Even then the valves 
look fun and the geometry is ackward.
