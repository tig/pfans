>Hearing all the carping about 914's brings to mind this little anecdotal (sp?)
>tale circa 1993, the year Byron drove his 1.7 VW bus powered model in DS.

>I first saw and ran against the car at the Little Rock Pro.  All us
>Honda and Nissan standard bearers from the east had quite a chuckle
>"sounds like a Bug, goes like a Bug...", at least off the light.
>Byron was in like 4th or something Sunday morning, until a bearing
>spun.  These were third gear courses, however.  (then he jumped in
>Paul Brown's 88 CRX Si, and ended up something like second.., but
>that's another story.)

>Next time, we were in Salina, on nice curvy speed maintenance courses,
>the kind once you're up to speed, he who keeps the most speed up wins.
>Even though the Nissans had twice the power, turns and transients were
>what mattered.  We all got spanked by a total of like two and a half
>seconds.  ON ONE DAY.  The next 10 cars were on like the same second.
>The whole humbling experience gave me great respect for old 914's.
>IMHO, they are all on greater plane than the cars left behind in the
