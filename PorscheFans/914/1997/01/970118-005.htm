Since I haven't even seen the car, I have know way of knowing the real 
condition. Besides, I live far away from where the car is (Austin TX?).  
There's also no way of knowing if any of the parts are good. Rusty chrome 
bumpers and a burned out relay board aren't worth much to anybody. But, 
it wouldbe a shame to let another 914/6 bite the dust as a parts car. 
Hell, I've read of cars in worse shape than this being rescued, some even 
had trees growing up through the floor. Where there's a will, there's a 
way. OK, you've got me interested, 1,000$, tops. ;)
