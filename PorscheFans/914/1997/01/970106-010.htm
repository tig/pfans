I was in Milpitas,CA this morning, and came across a guy selling
his 914.  I told him I was not really interested, but that I'ld
pass it along.

'72 914
Black & Silver
Rebuilt 1.7 (out of car)
new P&C 
new clutch
2 transmissions
spare hood
$1000 firm

408-253-7851 hm
408-577-3106 wk

I did not see the car.  He said that the car was good shape, stock,
and running until he decided to replace the clutch.  At that time
he started an engine rebuild then ran out of time.  He just wants
to free up space in his garage now.

I have absolutely no interest in this matter.  I just thought that
it might be of interest to someone even if it's only a box of parts.
