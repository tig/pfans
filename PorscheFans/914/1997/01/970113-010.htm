914!? 

Did you see the posting from Ralph Ricks? The 914 has a great Cd (for a 
car designed in the '60's) of between .34 and .35. This is better than 
the 911 or 928. (hey - something to crow about!). The new Boxster is .31. 
I think most air dams and wings are not intended to reduce the Cd, but to 
provide downforce and high speed stability. Adding wings, fenderflares, 
etc., is a tradeoff between aerodynamic effeiciency (as expressed by a 
low Cd) and low (or no) lift at high speeds. Sure, or P car has a low Cd, 
but with the stock front valence and no wings, I'm sure it has plenty of 
lift at high speeds. Since I don't drive this fast (over 70, usually), 
these add ons won't do much for me. Most wings on street cars are just 
for looks, anyway.
