To Bill Newlin

I finally got your address correct in my system.

Did you receive the picture of your car at Parade, I cyber-sent you?  Were you
able to load it so you could view it?

I just sent a couple of my 914 work-in-progress dedicated autocrosser (actually
they are old shots, but I don't have real current stuff, so that'll have to do)
to the dude who's the sysop for the PFans stuff.  We'll see if it gets on there
next week.  Can you believe that there are only 2 pictures of 914s on the whole
PFans gallery of pictures, when there are over three hundred (914) subscribers.

If you want, when you register in the roster, I can convert that picture of your
car, that I have, to a jpeg file and send it so all can see that pic of your
car.  Let me know.

Looks like the thread ran out on our aerodynamics discussion, but I got enough
to support my thoughts (i.e. most people stick stuff on their cars without
knowing the REAL aerodynamic value).  The last engineering manual I mentioned
has been a real resource for research at our level.  I'm going to be pouring
over it for some time.

Yeah, I saw the neo Olds Aurora (shortened wheelbase, looks like a two-door)
wing in RACER.  It reminded me of Joe Cogbills 968 wing, built by Fabcar.  Do
you do your own fabrication, or do you have it built by anyone in particular?

TAFN.  I hadn't heard from you in a while, so I thought I'd check to see if you
were still ticking the second hand on the timer :-)

Jebby :-]
