In a message dated 97-01-26 05:09:55 EST, you write:

<< 
   I have been reading the mail regarding this spacer/gasket/dohickey 
 that supposedly goes in the rear calipers between the caliper halves, 
 and all I can say is "Huh?"
 
   It is my understanding that the 914-6 had different rear brakes  (not 
 absolutely sure about that... maybe someone on the list can set me 
 straight), and perhaps it is these that have the mystical part.

914/6 calipers are different.  They have bigger pistons and the caliper
inself is slightly bigger.  However all 914 calipers are SUPPOSED to have a
square cut o ring, top and bottom, between the two caliper halves.  It sits
in a recess in one of the calper halves.  If your calipers don't have the o
ring, it eother fell out when you took the calipers apart, or the calipers
have been apart in the past and the oring was lost then.  The ring is
critical to keep the calipers from leaking.  Otherwise you are trusting the
flat surfaces of the two halves to perfectly mate and keep from leaking.  The
good news is that the rebuild kits that AutoAtlanta sells has the o ring in
them, although the ring is round in cross section which should work ok.  The
original square ones are available as I described in an earlier post.
