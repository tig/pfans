I don't think it's in the way at all, the only real problem is that the
engine lid is heavyer. But a screwdriver (which no 914 should be
without) makes a good impromptu prop. At least untill I can make one of
my own. 
I mounted the cooler on the engine lid for a couple of reasons. One:
it's an easy place to mount to. Two: The rules in my class don't allow
for cutting of sheet metal which I would have to do to mount in or on
the front bumper. Three: It's a daily driver, and as such I don't want
the cooler sticking out somewhere where road debris can damage it.
