Bill,

	First thing is what club are you autocrossing with? Second, what kind
of mods does your car have, besides the engine and carb. The reason why
I ask is that some club rules have rules that dissallow DOT race tires
in "stock" classes, and some have no such restriction. What region are
you in?

	As for the suggestion of running narrower tires than will fit under the
wheel wells? PHOEY! Yes, there is such a thing as over doing it with
tires for an autocrosser, but your car (with stock fenders?) has a LONG
way to go before you go to far on tire width. The best tire for a 914/4
using stock wheels under stock fenders is a 205/50-15. Anyone who tells
you that you should be running narrower tires than that either wants you
to have a handicap, or doesn't quite know what they're talking about.
The more tire you have, the more speed you can ultimately hold thru a
turn. The 1.8 sure wont do anything for straightaway speed. The 914
really shines in the tight sections. Speed maintenance is the most
subtle lesson you'll need to learn, and it's the one that will make a
914 competetive against cars with much more power. 

	Keep in mind however, that a 205/50-15 will just barely fit under the
rear fenders with the fuchs alloys. Pedrinis and other wheels that have
different backspacing may not work. Good luck!
