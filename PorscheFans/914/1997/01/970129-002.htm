For all persons contemplating a  rebuild of 914 rear brake calipers:

  There has been a thread running on the list regarding a "Phantom 
Rear Caliper Part".  It has been pointed out to me by Jon Lowe that 
there is some confusion over the necessary parts to rebuild the rear 
calipers on the 914, and that clearing this up is a safety issue.

  Several persons mentioned this part in the singular, and mentioning 
that it was difficult or impossible to obtain, leading me to draw an 
erroneous conclusion that they were talking about some other part 
than the subject of this posting:

                    FLUID CHANNEL O-RINGS"

  There are two O-rings, called "fluid channel O-rings that are 
required to correctly re-assemble the two halves of the rear brake 
calipers on the 914.  These two O-rings are better termed rubber 
washers, because they have aproximately the same cross-sectional 
shape as a garden hose washer, i.e. they are of square 
cross-section.  They fit into recesed wells in one of the caliper 
halves, which have fluid passages drilled in their centers.  They mate 
with fluid passages drilled directly into the flat face of the opposite 
caliper half.

  These two washers, or O-rings, are commonly available.  They 
come in the re-build kits supplied by GPR, of San Luis Obispo, CA.  
Phone for orders: (800) 321-5432.

  Jon also states:

"  They are listed in early to mid 70's 911 parts manuals for both front 
and rear calipers. They are also listed for the front brakes of the 914 
and the rings are the same.  "

  Therefore, they are probably also available from Porsche Dealers.

NOTE:  It is extremely important that NEW O-rings be fitted whenever 
the calipers are split.  The fluid pressures in the rear brake system are 
in excess of 70 Kg/ square cm...
that translates to roughly 1000 PSI !

  With pressures like this, you can see that fluid seal is extremely 
important, therefore ALWAYS fit NEW fluid channel O-rings after 
splitting the brake calipers.

  To further explain, the ONLY parts between the caliper halves on 
the 914 (4-cylinder cars) are the aforementioned fluid channel 
O-rings.  There are NO spacer plates, gaskets, shims, or any other 
magic widgets.

  I hope that this clears up any miss-understandings on what I and 
others were talking about.

				Thanks,
				Jim T.
