Hi 914ers:

Since it has gotten cold, I have started to use the heater in our 914 (73 
2.0L).

It sure smells bad, like exhaust. It did not smell like this last Feb and 
March.(1996)

The system looks like it is all in place, we replaced the full heater 
system a few years ago carefully, and while it smelled like this briefly 
after the heater parts were put in place then, the bad smell is not going 
away now. Again, all parts appear to be in place.

Two things have changed though:

1. I cleaned up the relay board and replaced all three relays -- which 
   fixed our intermittent fuel pump problems. I also think the heater 
   blower wasn't always working. It blows very hard now, whenever turned on.

2. We had a new Bursch muffler put in about one month ago. I simply do 
   not remember a smell before, but then I don't think I turned on the heat
   before the new muffler either.

Any ideas what to look for? Is this a rotten heat exchanger? The muffler was
put in place by my local shop, and the guy there is very competent, but 
could he have messed  something up?

thanks in advance.

Mark
