Possibly, but I would more likely suspest a fuel line connection on the
rail rather than the o-ring seals. The o-rings won't cause a fuel leak,
rather they'll leak air _into_ to intake runner making the cylinder run
lean, and the engine run lousy.

"Bowed"? It sounds like you're refering to negative camber. I can't
imagine what else you could be refering to. A good alignment shop with a
full set of shims should be able to remedy that problem.
