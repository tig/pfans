No, this is not a 914 story for the most part, but read on..

'81 Vangon, 180K miles, 40K miles on Canadian reman of unknown age.
Compression on front two cyl 10% low.  May be burning some oil.

Biennial smog check due:  checked and gapped Bosch platinum plugs,
tried to adjust idle without reading my new Bentley manual.  
Mistake #1 - not RTFM (reading the manual).

Took to local Arco where I found new people since last year when the
guy had put me through hell because he hadn't read the manual on my
914.  He didn't know how to check the EGR.  Had to show him the manual
after wasting a full day fiddling with EGR plumbing.

Former owners were on the run.  It was something about selling guns in
the station.  Smog check guy had not yet arrived, so the manager fired
up the machine and let me do a pre-check:  thanks for the tip  from
this somebody to ask for a pre-check.

CO was 2% and HC was off-scale.  He showed me a chart that says 1981
model max is 1% CO and 120 HC.  Fiddled the idle adjustments and got it
down to 0.5% CO and 140 HC; not quite good enough.

Went home and installed new Bosch platinums and rotor and cap.  Went
back and ran a new pre-test.  Smog check guy had never seen an
aircooled VW, but let me run one more quick test.  HC was off-scale
again.

Went back home, fiddled everything, read the manual where I learned you
gotta disconnect the oxy sensor and idle stabilizer before setting
idle.  Did that; still rough idle.  Pulled the injectors and did flow
checks on my workbench.  All were about 2.5 cc per second, but the
spray pattern was not a good cone.  Not bad, but not perfect.

Decided maybe it was time to check the CAT converter.  Found the 
innards were a pile of rubble.  Went to buy a new one, but the only 
thing on the shelf was a universal one without flanges for $60-100.  
Checked their catalog, and found the Porsche 924 unit was 3/4" shorter 
than the Vangon unit, which meant it would fit my 914 even better than 
the Vangon unit I had put on the 914 last year.  Stole the one off my 
'76 914 that was a substitute for the $1K original (if available.) 
Installed the 924 unit on my 914, and moved the Vangon unit over to
the Vangon.  Serendipity, or something.

924 unit was $90+ from Auto Parts Club in Torrance.  Prices at other 
places go way up from there.

New (10K miles) CAT, mediocre injectors:  Vangon still idling funny, 
but worth another try.  Took it to a Mobil, where the guy was 
knowledgable on VW & Porsche.  

CO and HC were zero!  He had never seen a VW this clean, 
but recently installed a new CAT on a Ford and got the same result.

He richened the mixture to get just a little HC, and ran the test.
Limits for an '81 Vangon are really 2% CO and 250 HC, due to its gross
weight of 5093.  I could have passed without the new CAT and other crap
if I had gone to the right place the first time.  New plugs rotor and
cap were wasted, as was all the hassle testing injectors, etc. 
However, I'm glad I installed the new CAT.  It seems to have more
power, and I know I won't get nailed with a drive-by smog check.  

BTW, I checked my 914 last year, and found that the new CAT has only
about 1 1/2" backpressure at WOT, 5.8K rpm, so it is not robbing power.
You can make up for it by putting a glasspak in place of the final 
muffler.  Sounds good, too.

Hope this experience helps you.
