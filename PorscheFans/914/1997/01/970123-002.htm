    Well, maybe... But all the "English-speaking" friends I know
    would use "drophead" to refer to any car whose roof can be
    lowered or removed (and they'd call the roof a "hood", too).

    My Merriam-Webster dictionary says that a "convertible" is any
    car whose roof can be lowered or removed, and that a "roadster"
    is "an automobile with an open body that seats two and has a
    folding fabric top and a luggage compartment in the rear".

    By this definition, the 914 doesn't qualify as a roadster, no
    matter WHAT the classified ads in Pano say.

    If you parked a 911 coupe, a 911 Cabriolet, and a 911 Targa in
    front of someone and asked him to pick out the "convertible",
    there's no chance that he'd pick the Targa.

    The 914, with the same removable hard roof panel as the Targa, is
    similarly not a "convertible", so the answer to Brad's question
    is:

    "Neither.  The 914 (if we may use the Porsche-trademarked name in
    a generic sense) is a targa."
