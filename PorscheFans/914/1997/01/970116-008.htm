This is _the_ most commmon leak for the 901 gear box. The fix will wind
up costing you about 20 to 30 bucks. Most of that cost is the gear oil
that you'll be replacing. The o-ring is easy to replace, requires no
special tools, and is really cheap. You will need to drain the tranny
first and then pull the speedo drive and replace the o-ring.

When doing a gear oil change, you need the mondo 17mm allen wrench and a
word of caution, remove the fill plug FIRST. I say this because if you
remove the drain plug first, draining the oil out of the tranny, and
then discover that the fill plug is frozen or stripped, you're up the
proverbial creek. Make sure you will be able to refill the tranny before
you drain it.

Yes, the vent is small protrusion just behind the bellhousing on the top
of the tranny, and it's vaguely bolt-shaped. It's always good to just
confirm that the vent is clear of debris.
