The performance plastic bushings are stiffer than the "street" bushings.
But not like the street bushings are stiffer from stock. The difference
between the two plastic bushings isn't that much compared to the
original rubber bushings. The material is essentially the same, but the
compunds are slightly different. I went for the perfomance bushings.
They are noticeably stiffer than stock, but it didn't make the ride so
unpleasant. And it improved the handling noticably.

Leave the heat exchangers alone. Disconnect the half-shafts, the e-brake
cables, the brake lines and remove the arm. I took the arms w/shaft to
the machine shop and they had no problem at all.

The stuff called plastic bushing grease, it's silicon based grease. But
the nick-name involved a somewhat different substance...
It's really a mess to work with and it's really sticky.

The sticking is possibly the piston, not the bore. BTDT
