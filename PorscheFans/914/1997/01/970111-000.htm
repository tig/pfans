Regarding boosting CR... have just reassembled 2.0 with (i hope) about
8.5 cr & new stock 7.6 pistons.  It all started 2 teardowns ago when
there were 4 near new jugs... rerung w/ total seal & read the back
issues enuf to learn that heads could be flycut about .050 inch (about
2mm) for higher cr.  Local vw shop said SURE we can... then they
discovered that heads had been cut before, and stopped at .025, becuz
much more would get near or into the exh stud holes and mess up things a
lot... so lesson 1 is hope ya have virgin heads, lesson 2 is that at
beyond 070 cut you may have big trubl. (joys of unknown historical
atrocities, ch 1.)  

That rebuild died when it dropped a valve head (3 yrs ago) My 55 yr old
memory is now having trubl w// where all the pieces are, and what goes
where... but I digress.... upshot was that I needed new set of p&c's...
the prices have shot up, since last nov... and supplies are thin... so I
opted for stock set from Mark Stephens Performance... they also redid
the heads w/ new ss valves and drop=proof seats & fixed the dents the
looose valve head made ... all for about $300 ( i know, the sodium
valves are gone, but will it really make any difference in a hyd cam
street motor?)... the P&c's (KS) were another 700, about 200 less than
anyone else quoted...

Partsman Bill at MSP seems very knowledgeable, and can reel off deck
heights $ head volumes from memory... he says stock deck ht (distance
between piston top & head top is about 070 in.  914 2 heads should have
about 62-65 cc volume, whereas mine now cc about 52.... my deck ht is
about 035 in.  All this "...is about.." measuring is as best I can do at
home, even with a real cc setup and using Ray Litz' (Competition
Engineering) info sheet on deck ht (easier than clay)...

anyway I chose stock p&c partly for price & availability & partly 'cuz I
was worried about getting the cr too high for street gas... and not
being too certain about some of the measurements at the time .... all
the gurus say 9:1 is max on pump 92 in chevies & fords.  Add to that the
apparent phenomenom that 914's always re'q premi fuell even at low
cr's... (?? would somebody explain this to me please) 

  Bill says the dish in stock pistons varies frm 5-7cc, and best I can
measr, my new 7.6's have 4cc.  Then there's the head seal (gskt)... my
new kit from EBS in Sparks has .77mm gskts, whereas my old squished
gskts measr 1mm.  After much calculating I decided to leave the gskts
out and go for 8.5 cr and see how it works.  Rich Bontempi, Bill & the
guys at German Parts all say that the head gskts are superflous, so ya
can figure they will make about a 9-12cc variance in cr calculations and
this is the cheapest boost there is 

(this is a new hydr cam motor Web-91h).  Bill says the web lifters are
troublsome (can anyone share experience w/ those?), and sold me a new
set of eden lifters which have a larger oil feed hole, $100, (what can I
say, I'm easy..)  Setting up the clearance with these buggers is
apparently something of a black art.  Unless you have a good press, ya
can't fill them w/oil (as per the vw bus manual), and it looks like
several hour of fiddling is expected once the engine is running... and
ya all know how easy it is to set the valves with the engine in
place.... I'm having second tho'ts about this... esp when the how to
instructions from MSP & Web are vastly different.  Bill says put em in
"dry" and follow the instructions... I'll let ya know how it goes...

....the pushrod issue s already been covered by others, but let me add
that the difference between a solid & hyd rod is 10mm .  there is also
an INSTALLED length difference between stock vw bus hyd pushrods and the
replacement rods which have inserted  ball ends (they seat deeper)..
about 2mm... bus steel hyd pushrods actually weigh a bit less than the
alum solid ones

Incidentally, on the subject of tuning the Injection system, the bus
manuals are vastly superior to the 914 manuals.

end result is that my flycut heads installed w/o gskts seat about 2mm
closer to the case as compared to a newly acquired 2.0 used motor that I
just bought (dunno if it has been apart befor either, 2nd owner says
no... but... Ch 3)... initial valve adjuster screw pos'n appears
"normal" w/ vw rods 

so now I have a leftover set of new Web lifters!  and also a stock vw
bus hyd cam...maybe I'll put that other engine together for the tractor
pull or maybe the hillclimb, and then there's also that new web 93 solid
cam & lifters, I think its time to go to the swap meet....

You can use a 1.7/1.8 case w/ 2.0 stuff, but be sure to block off the
side oil relief valve if using hyd cam.  Can any one enlighten me as to
why vw/p did away with the side gallery relief valve anyway?  What if ya
block it off in a stock 1.7 motor?

Back to heads... Bill says stock vw have about 50cc vol, and use deeper
dish.. I suspect 1.7/1.8 heads also have less vol, but haven't cc'd any
yet,  ... given the 2.0 head situation, a set of older or vw heads on a
2.0 may yield just the right performance CR, and the vw shops can put in
big valves, etc... I may try that for a "race" motor... vw bus 2.0 heads
have about 50cc but have a different exh port, so ya'd hafta fab an
exhaust system... ok for a track car, but no good for smog inspection or
winter heat.   I once built a 2.0 914 w/ bus p&c's (very cheap) and it
ran pretty good, but that was my first 914 project when I knew a lot
less...

also note that 2.0 vs other flywheel & fan timing marks are different
due to dif't stroke, so don't mix 'em up, ar at least remark 'em...
these are the joyous discoveries one makes when acquiring 914's with
unknown histories...(ch 2.) ... "geez,  no wonder the thing wouldn't run
when set to spec timing!"

I know "they" say the 2.0 head is superior, but that was 25 years ago,
and would a rebuilt vw hi-po big valve, extrude honed older style head
REALLY be noticeably different??   tho stock FI  might not work  at all
w/ big valves.... I recall Rich Bontempi saying that the D-jet FI
doesn't like cams & other air-flow/pressure mods, but that the LJet 1.8
was the hot ticket back when scca ran w/ FI 'cuz it will tolerate
radical cam (& prob'ly any other cheater stuff ya can slip in there!) 
Weber says the 93 stage 1 solid cam will work w/ FI, but does anyone
have experiences to report? ..esp related to passing smog test...

Problem here in CA is that SMOG rules require visual inspect and
everything must be stock appearing... Carburetors are verboten, whereas
the vw performance guys can run carbs and stroker type 4's, so they have
more performanc leeway than we do... lately some smog shops are even
rejecting cars with chrome air cleaners and aftermarket exhausts...
totally dopey, but the objectiv is not clean air, it is to get rid of
all older cars and anything that even looks like "performance" becuz
everyone knows they must be making NOx... so getting too far away from
stock setup & FI may mean no license plates... higher CR should actually
improve the burn, but the next shoe to drop will probly be official
4-gas analysis at which point our high CR engines wil peg the NOx
meter....(put in TWO head gskts!)(better yet keep a spare bus motor)  so
the hot ticket to a performance ride in CA is a '65 or older car which
is smog exemp (for now) or we can register any 25 yr old car (914'S TOO)
as "historic" and use it for anything EXCEPT as a daily driver, unless
of course you are going to & from an event every day and your office
just happens to be on the route.. 

calculations look something like this:  94mm bore X 71mm stroke = 493cc
swept volume, add cyl head vol = 52cc, add dish vol = 5cc, add gskt vol
= 5cc, add deck clearance = 9cc, = 564cc total vol @bdc, 71cc @tdc for
CR = 564/71= 7.95 or leave out the gskt  for 559/66= 8.47 CR;

 you can see that small errors in cc'ing & measuring can lead to
significant real CR differences, so i decided to try to err on the low
side and round off toward the safety margin.   measure everything 3
times. and if yhr results change, do it 3 times more.. QUESTION THE
ANSWERS.

OTHER SUBJECT: i also have a real VW-Porsche six-gt (9140430919) bo't 23
yrs ago as a discarded race car near Stuttgart, I'd like some help in
tracing its german history if anyone has those talents... I have the
orig'l german title w/ ownership history...
