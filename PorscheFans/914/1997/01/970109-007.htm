torch, chainsaw, nuclear, whatever..."

Jebby's $.02 =  Dirk, I know you were genuinely serious, but at the same time
you crack me up.  My hilarious mind can picture a caricature of you, hovering
over car parts with a torch, like an old ship's boilerplate-maker in a junk yard
:-)    (my mind runs rampant sometimes).  On a more serious note, to add to
Dirk's thoughts, just remember the recent conversation we all bantered about,
regarding possible harm from breathing heated (above 400 degrees F)
Polytetraflouroethelynes (PTFE) a.k.a. Teflon (R).  Even when you are certain of
the composition of the substance you're about to torch, a rule of thumb is, if
it's rubber or plastic, it doesn't matter, protect yourself from what you may
inhale.  Ventilate/blow the fumes away from yourself, and wear an appropriate
mask.

I agree with Josh Hadler's advice, I think I'd rather find a way to have them
machine-pressed out and in.  If the boogers don't press out easily, then you
revert to Mike Lee's advice of slightly heating up the housing, which should
ease the removal (but the machine shop will know that anyway), and he's right,
that Whale KY Jelly really works.  The "TORCH IT OUT" technique is a last
resort, when ALL else fails.  Avoid the drippey plastic goo and stink.

Remember the difference between a Sears and a Midas muffler shop.  You will
never see a torch in a Sears shop - they lost one ONCE, and learned their
lesson.  Midas still hasn't learned, and at last count they lose quite a few
shops every year.  Learn how to apply mechanical intelligence, without the use
of a torch, whenever possible.  Don't get me wrong, I have and use one.  It's a
matter of training.  I know how to do shock, muffler, and machining work
utilizing the mechanical techniques they'd even teach a "Sears" employee, and
they work.  Having a torch available can lull you into laziness and eventually
burning down your pride and joy if you're not very careful.  Use it wisely.
