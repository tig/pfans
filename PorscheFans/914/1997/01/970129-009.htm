My car's swaybar was installed by the PO but I'm pretty sure it's a 22mm
Weltmeister. Jason at Paragon Products (1-800-200-9366) seems to be a good
source (also for information).

Mine goes through the body under the gas tank. The location where the bar
comes through has welded-in reinforcements. The adjustable drops connect
directly to the flanges on the A-arms.

BTW, last year I was questioning whether or not to go with a smaller bar
because I didn't want to compromise the comfort of the ride. I have come to
like the big bar and the flat cornering that comes with it. I don't think
the ride suffers at all except going over potholes, etc.
