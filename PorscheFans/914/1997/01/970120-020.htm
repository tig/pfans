Hi folks,

I'm trying to install a Weltmeister through-body front sway bar
on a '73 914 that originally came without any sway bars.  I bought
the triangular re-inforcing mounting plates, and am trying to figure
out the best way to locate them in place.  There is a indent where
the plate is supposed to go, but there's quite a bit of leeway in
placement.  How accurately must this plate be located (the instructions
are not clear at all)?  And once I have everything located correctly,
should these brackets be welded in, or are the bolts sufficient?

Thanks,
Mike

P.S.
For all those asking about whether or not it is worth converting a /4 to
a /6; let me say that it is a major project (both time and $$$), and
a *hell* of a lot more complicated than AA's $15 booklet would suggest.
Also, FWIW, Motor Meister sells a kit @ ~$6k to convert a /4 to a /6.
Supposedly, this is complete and includes everything needed.  I've never
dealt with them before, and just passing along ad info; YMMV, std.
disclaimers, yadda, yadda, yadda.......
