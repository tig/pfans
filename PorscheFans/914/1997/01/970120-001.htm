For those of you commenting on the value of the parts of this car let me
inform you further about its condition.

I saw this car abut 3.5 months ago when the guy was asking $5000.  There is
no engine sheetmetal, axels, oil tank hoses, transaxel, footpad, ect.  I
dont even remember if bumpers were on the car.  I am sure the oil tank is
shot like the rest of the car.  The only thing of value are the four
fenders.  There is nothing there to part out.
