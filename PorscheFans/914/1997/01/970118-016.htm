Larry,

I ran across a guy who did a pretty slick oil cooler installation on his
beautiful 914, so I'm having him do it to mine. He mounts the cooler under
the car next to the transmission. A NACA duct is cut into the left rocker
panel, and air from this is ducted to the cooler. He claims his car never
gets hot, and he does live in Texas and autocrosses in PCA events.

Obviously, the disadvantage is cutting the sheet metal of the rocker panel,
but I find the duct there far less obtrusive tha a front mounted oil
cooler. 

Fellow's name is Ed Mayo. Has a very nice, clean, roomy shop near Fort
Worth, TX called Mayo Performance.
