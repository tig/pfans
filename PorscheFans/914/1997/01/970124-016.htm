Anyone else see the article in the latest (March '97)
European Car?

Mark Stephens High Performance (805) 822-5678 has
a way to remake a 1.8L head into a 2.0L head.

1) The intake flange - all holes are welded up, the split
between the ports is welded and filled in, intake flange
is machined to 2.0L specs, redrilled and new studs
installed (3-stud pattern).

2) The spark plug holes - plug holes and fin area below the
holes are welded up, new plug holes are indexed, drilled,
and tapped to Porsche specs.  According to EC, because
of the welded area under the head, the "copy" is actually
stronger around the plug and more crack resistant.

3) Valves and seats - seat pockets are bored to 2.0L size.
New 55 cc Rockwell hardness SuperSeats are installed
using a proprietary technique.  ec says it's so good that
a 5 year, 100,000 mile warrenty against dropping a seat
is offered, regardless of use.  The ports and bowl area is
machine blended to the new seat size.  The chamber is
reworked to the 2.0L shape.  Valve guides are replaced
with Mangansese Bronze guides.  New valves are one
piece stainless steel.

Cost $349 each.

European Car tends to treat everything they review as
the greatest thing since sliced bread.  I wonder if that is
the case here, or are these new heads a "good thing"?
I do wonder about the SS valves rather than sodium filled.

Comments?
