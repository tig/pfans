I just completed replacing the drivers side pan and cleaning the sound
proofing "goo" from the passangers pan and center tunnel on my car.  I have
discovered a method for quickly removing the sound proofing that should be
shared.

Your better half sould not be at home for this.  Go into the bathroom and
procure the "heat gun" that women (and all you long haired 914's) use to
dry hair with.  Take this to your garage (you now understand why this has
to be done when she is out) and warm the sound proofing slightly.  A putty
knife will then very easily remove this warmed material in large pieces.

I have used this method on two different 914's and works well until you are
discovered with the "heat gun" in the garage.
