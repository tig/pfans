>But, but, I know looks arent as important as cooling but under the
engine lid ? It Looks like crap there, is in the way, you have oil lines
running over the engine, and makes the lid heavy. There has to be a
better way ? It reminds me of the VW bus owner who mounts his oil cooler
on the side of his bus because his can/wont find a better place. hey ,
you can always mount that sucker on that big rear trunk. Just my
..02.........Don<

I have a copy of the 914-6GT front cooler duct work and a rather large RX-7
cooler.  I was thinking about mounting up front.  But I did not want to cut the
car up to install it.  So it started me thinking, which is dangerous, <G>, but
why not use a 911 style front cooler.  So now my plans are to mount the cooler
in the front fender well, drivers side, since that is where the tank is located,
and everything is the opposite of the 911.  I do believe if Porsche continued
production into the 80s, they would have done the same thing.  My plans include
a small duct just below the bumper cut into the valance to scoop the air into
the cooler, and use as much 911 hardware as possible.  I will post details
somewhere when I get the system installed.

Parts I am using,

914-6 oil tank,
911 oil thermostat.
911 style oil lines, have to be made, I feel 911 solid pipes, actually help as a
cooler also.  As long as you don't under coat them.
930s front cooler, with new seals to fit he 914 fender, and will be reusing an
new washer board.  If needed I can mount a small electric fan, to pull more air,
but then I don't think it will be needed.
And some serious duct work, but then no real big problem.
Dry sump oil pump, maybe.

But then it may wait until the six goes in, time will tell.  But the basics will
be in place.

But then my 914 is still in body work stages, so now is the time to do these
things.
