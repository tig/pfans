	Josh2 talked about the Optima battery.  Definitely has its
good points.  I remember seeing one sitting upside-down on top of
a 914 motor at one point; try doing *that* with your conventional
battery!
	The down-side is that they really, really *HATE* to be deep-
cycled.  My mechanic mentioned it to me, and I know two people who
have backed that up with personal experience.  One said that his
Optima was noticeably weaker after only *two* drains.
	The good news is that both of those people have gotten re-
placement batteries under warranty.
	Oh, they're also kinda heavy.

	To the person with the rotten battery tray:  This is a very
common 914 ailment.  Repair panels are available from a variety of
sources (Auto Atlanta, Doc and Cy's, probably GPR, even AutoMashin').
The tray should be welded on, as should the other repair panels.  If
you let the rust go for long enough, the part of the car that the
right-rear suspension bolts to can break off, which can ruin your
whole day.  Also, the part of the body the fuel pump mounts to can
rust away, leaving your pump flopping in the breeze.
	Warning:  Significant rust repairs can easily cost several
thousand dollars if you pay someone to do them!  I am told that they
are not repairs to be done by a first-time welder.  Don't know myself,
as I am a non-welder.

	Good luck!
