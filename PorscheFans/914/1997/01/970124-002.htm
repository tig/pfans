Jeff:

Not exactly... While it's true that a car's roll resistance can come 
from either the springs or the sway bars, increasing the spring rate 
to limit roll isn't such a good idea.

Here's why:

Let's say that you can live with a HUGE amount of roll... Like 10
degrees or so.  How far does the outboard spring compress when the
chassis rolls that much?  An inch, maybe?

You mentioned that your car has 165-pound-per-inch "progressive"
springs.  I would expect that those springs have a rate of something
like 100 pounds/inch for the first few inches of compression, but
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and say that they offer 165
pounds per inch throughout their range.

Ok... This means that, at 10 degrees of roll (which compresses the
spring an inch), your springs are only contributing 165 pounds of
roll resistance to the chassis.

Your car wants a whole lot more than 165 pounds of roll-resistance,
especially if you want to limit roll to a more-reasonable value,
like 5 degrees or less.  To get those roll-resistance numbers from
the springs alone, your springs will be so stiff that the tires will
hardly spend any time on the ground; every little bump on the track 
will send them into the air.

If, on the other hand, you put relatively soft springs on the car
and use a stiff sway bar, you'll get good tire compliance AND good
roll resistance.  You'll also be able to quickly adjust the car's
over/understeer balance, since it's a whole lot easier to move a
swaybar droplink than to replace springs and torsion bars.

In general, it's best NOT to use one suspension component (the
springs, in this case) to perform multiple tasks... If you can split
the suspension control among multiple components (springs for keeping
the car off the ground, sway bars for limiting roll, etc.), you don't
have to compromise one aspect of the car's handling for another. 

Well... You don't have to compromise MUCH, anyway.
