Hi 914-er's!

  I have been following the money in vs. money out argument with 
some interest.  I agree that you should never EXPECT to get all your 
money back, but one never knows for sure.  
  Remember when Cobras were $8K or so?  What are they now?  
There is a definite market for exotic cars.  During the '80's, the market 
was over-bought, driving prices unrealistically high.  With later 
economic tough times, the market adjusted, and is still adjusting.  Some 
people who bought collector's cars during the tail end of the boom lost 
their shirts.  
  However, every time a 914 is turned into a parts car, or totaled and 
hauled off for scrap, that increases the value of the remaining cars.  I 
used to own an MGA Twincam, which I bought for $450.  I sold it a few 
years later (after installing an MGB engine, so that it would be a reliable 
daily driver), for $800. and thought I did all right, although I certainly 
didn't get back the cost of the engine swap.  Today, a Twincam will 
cost you at least $15K, and I don't think that condition even enters into 
it!
  It is my belief that the 914 is near the bottom of it's valuation curve.  
That is, the curve that all exotic machinery goes through.  When it's 
first sold, it depreciates as do most cars, until it reaches some sort of 
bottom value, about 10 - 20 years after new.  (My twincam was about 7 
yrs old when I bought it, and 10 when I sold it.)
  After this, due to rarity, collectors interest, and the fact that good old 
sports cars just aren't made any more,  the exotic car will start to 
appreciate.  By the time the average 914 is 40 years old, it will probably 
be worth something like $100K per copy.  (Which, after inflation, might 
mean that you can almost recover your investment!)  So, just hang in 
there!

				Regards,
				Jim T.
