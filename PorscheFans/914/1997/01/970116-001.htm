it would be nice if we could get back the cost in restoring or upgrading
our cars but I've never seen that happen in any of the marques i've
played with.... but if you are not a home mechanic and want a really
nice car for a lot less than it would cost to do it oneself, then the
way yu arrive at value is to compare what's available at the moment and
recognize you couldn't do it yourself for anywhere near the price much
less the labor of love... so pay the price & enjoy the car...
 i've probly got close to $5000 in my 73 and it MIGHT pull $3000 from
the market... now i didn't intend to get that much into it, but things
break, and dreams of performance improvement fog our brains... 
i recently sold a decent MGB to a guy for a fair $2300, whereupon he got
the restoration fever & spent thousands to make it better, and now he
wants to sell it and expects it to be worth $8k... but the MGB market
rarely goes above $3500, no matter how nice it is... (my bro has about
7500 in his B)( i sold a "oughta be worth 3500" hot rod 65 ranchero
recently for 2k 'cuz i neeeded the cash for the 914's)   I see this all
the time with project cars... we'ere talking about cult cars here, with
very limited followings, unfinancable except by VISA, and usually seen
as less than the most important use of $$ by one's significant other...
if we don't HAVE TO sell them it's irrelevant.  We enjoy them and drive
the value out of them.
  When the divorce, job loss or other "I NEED CASH" dynamic occurs, the
real sale price is often about 1/2 that advertised... & 1/3 of the
"investment" ... a parallel in the used car market is that real nice
late model cars go for about 1/2 the LOW or wholesale book value at the
dealer auctions...
