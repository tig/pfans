You're very correct there. In an autocrosser, the lower profile tires
have a distinct advantage. They respond quicker, and are less prone to
rolling onto the sidewalls. In this respect, you want the _shortest_
tire that you can get. I plan on experimenting to see if I can fit 13"
wheels over the brakes in my 914. I would like to get the gearing
advantage that gives me. I don't know if 13s will fit though. Something
like a 
225/50-13 would be nice for a street prepared autoxer. But that means a
few $k in fender flares to allow the tires to fit.

Don't try this yourself untill you know what class you want to race in.
Most if not all clubs will not allow you to change wheel sizes in stock
classes. I would avoid 14" wheels as the selection of race rubber in 14"
is pretty limited.

Nope, you're not wrong.
