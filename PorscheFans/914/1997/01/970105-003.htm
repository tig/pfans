Hi everyone!

 My name is Steve, from Yukon Canada where I am the only 914 owner for a
couple thousand miles.
 I own a computer shop, write HTML stuff & am a radio announcer, audio
producer and crazed fly fisher.
 My wife runs a daycare and the oldest of our three sons is about to get his
drivers license.
 Enough bio, on to the pleading... 

 I made the mistake of having some shop do the clutch instead of myself,
 (at -40 C ya can't blame me) 
 and $1300.00 Canadian later it shifts again, but they totally messed up the
vacuum & other hoses.
 Currently blowing blue (since the shop got to it).

 Does anyone have an accurate description of how the vacuum and other lines
are connected in the engine 
 compartment ? A clear photo would be a great help, the manual is, well, you
know...

  I wish to do a bit of rebody work in a couple of months and am looking for
any tried and true
   suggestions. Especially if any one has experience with the RAYCO rebody.
It is attractive.
  I understand that this is a glue-on kit?  Hence additional weight.

 Automotion has some 916 fibreglass that looks okay in the catalogue, anyone
have a comment?

  Any good used wider-than-stock wheels out there?

  Anyone have a tight running turnkey engine with all electrics and hoses
attached? 
  Performance extras would be nice but not imperative, must be injected, no
carbs thanks.
  Exhaust system also a plus.
  Can offer up to $2000.00 Canadian for the right unit. 

Please contact me at my E-mail address   netshop@polarcom.com


                                            Thanks,        Steve
