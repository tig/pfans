Andrew:

You're absolutely right, but I was answering a different question.
Whether it was Barry's intended question or not, I can't say. I should
have quoted the original message:

I agree with your premise that thicker sway bars are probably the first
thing to consider for the track. But as I read it, Barry was talking
about balance (and with linear springs). My point was that regardless of
its effect on lap times, increasing spring rates, if done
proportionately at each end, should not require re-balancing with a
change in the sway bars. The other half of my response was that its hard
to comment on Barry's set up without knowing what size torsion bars he
has installed.

By the way, I'm saving your post in my reference files.
