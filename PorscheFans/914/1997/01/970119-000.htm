I have one, homebuilt I believe, that works pretty well.  Consists of
two pieces, a angle bar which bolts to the front torsion bar mountings,
and a removable tow bar.  Comes out from the car very low to clear
oem-style spoilers.  I got it years ago from a friend.  Works on both
914 and 911, and I've used it for both, but mostly to move the cars back
and forth between body shops when I was putting them back together.  The
removeable bar part is very handy, allowing you to haul it somewhere &
quick disconnect.  I wouldn't drive a car at the track with the cross
bar in place, however, because obviously, there isn't a lot of ground
clearance.  And trailers are much better for any long-distance hauling,
but that should be obvious.

I don't know if the original parts were based on a VDub bar.

If you end up trying to make one, I could measure/sketch this one for
you.
