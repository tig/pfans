Part I - In which I have a question:

I've read a few places about a program from Mr. Gasket called "Desktop
Dyno".  The new Classic Motorbooks catalog that was just delivered in the
mail has a book/disk package of the same name (assume it's the same thing).
Has anyone used this thing?  Is it any good (fun)?

Part II - In which I have an idea:

A while back, someone (sorry, I don't remember whom) mentioned a program
called "CarTest" which can be downloaded on the net (sorry, I don't remember
where).  Well, I did and it's a fun program.

(Here's the idea part) Since we all had so much fun recently introducing
ourselves recently, why don't we list our favorite AUTOMOTIVE RELATED
software (I've never seen any 914 related software per se).

Jeff D.

PS - Yes, I've been reading Pooh to my daughter at bedtime.
