I somehow think I'm going to regret asking this but
given certain criteria what are the good and bad points about
a modern (say v8 either a Porsche or a new dohc Americian v8) vs a 
standard pushrod v8 vs a Porsche 6 I'm thinking 3 liter.

Givens 
1) this is a toy to go out an have fun with I'm not that concerned
   with resale.
2) ease of maintance is a good thing
3) I can drive a car at a reasonable rate but since I'm entering 
   middleage I don't need a car to scare the hell out of me. 
4) I realize there will be a price difference to do each but Really how  
  much.  (this isn't a big concern)
5) I don't want to destroy the handling of the car.
6) I've already made an number of upgrades (911 suspension brakes        
  strengthing the chassis ect. 5 bolt patterns and fenders flairs (that  
  I made myself with a English wheel a hammer and a weilder brag brag..I 
   am really proud of those flairs they were my first sheet metal    
project.)
7) I can rebuild an engine or can afford to have one built.
8) I have a fairly complete machineshop (Bridgeport Mill S/b lath mig tig 
   ect.)
9) I realize I'll probable have to get rid of the orginal trans ???
   The car was a 75 so the sideshifter is nice.


Ok I respect your opions so any advice is apreciated.

thanks 

Joe Davis
