Well here's the results....Thanks to all who responded and Mike Feeser the
confidence to go ahead and try the manual method...IMHO the following will work:

A) Have pressed out at a shop...probably the easiest....but you pay...

B) Heat up with a torch....holy cow..can only imagine this one on a Cheech
and Chong movie...God knows which end would come out first...please don't
try this one at home...find a large field before doing..

C) Manual Method...this is how I did it and it really did work....just take
your time doing it...

1: Take a good pocket knife and cut straight in to the rod to cut the
lip/top off of the bushing.
    this will make a big rubber washer...
2: Now the end  of the bushing side is exposed..Take a drill approx 1/8" and
drill a number of holes             down into the rubber...this is the messy
part and if you pace yourself no smoke will appear....
    Be careful to drill straight and not nick the metal parts..
3: Pick some of the rubber out with needle nose or hemostats...and repeat
step #2
4: Spray down the crevice liberally with WD40 and give the rod/nut a twist
with rachet....
   You can also whack the rod with a rubber hammer(rubber ONLY)
5: After approx 30 minutes the rod will come out...

Takes time but was free and I did it myself......Yes Virginia it can be
done.....
