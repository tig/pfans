Hello P fans, 
 
 Hope everyone is well and there 914's are running ( I wish 8 (   )
 Well this is probibly a waste of bandwith but I'll tell you anyway.
 Here in Southern California we are lucky enough to have a Porsche swap
meet almost every month (Pomona fair grounds) and as Im looking for that
good 914 part deal , I also keep my eye out for Fuchs if the price is
right, I just love these wheels. Anyway, I once saw a fuchs wheel clock
and has to have one.I made one and it came out very nice but, a friend
wanted it so I sold it. I started to notice (at the swap meet) there
where a lot of damaged fuchs ( hit curbs ?) for sale cheap. Even cheaper
to make a clock out of a damaged wheel.  This last clock started out as
a $20 14in fuch with a dent and a crack. Took the wheel to a machinist
buddy with a mill and had him cut the back off (right behind the face)
for $10 bucks and had him notch the center for the clock, took it to the
alum weilder and had the crack fixed for $20 bucks. A little hammering a
little filing and it was good as new. Since this wheel had a nasty dent
to start with I painted the wheel the color of my car instead of polish.
I looks great hanging on the garage wall,and it was cheap $60 bucks.
Just something for you Porsche nuts to think about, we (I) need to have
my garage/workshop look good too. If you do the clock thing the 7in
alloys look even better with that deeper look but, try not to waste a
good Fuch. Have fun, 
                      Don
