Hi Jeff.

You can order MSD's "universal kit" for 4-cylinder motors, from Summit, for
example.  They're 8mm, spiral core, basically indestructable (sp?).

However, it is difficult (though not impossible) to fit the OEM (brown)
plug wire ends (the ceramic-phenolic thingies) to an 8mm wire -- it's very
tight, and you'll cuss a lot :-) Or, you could use the supplied (more
flexible) ends, but it may be difficult getting them onto the forward two
plugs, as they're shrouded by the engine's sheet metal.

I have both an old(er) Jacobs set and a new(er) MSD set on 2 different
914/4-2.0 motors -- the quality of the Jacobs stuff did not impress me, the
MSD stuff is fine. All the supposedly correct plug wire sets I've seen from
Germany have been too short -- I guess they were really for the 1.7/1.8.
YMMV.
