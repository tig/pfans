Thought some of you Porsche-nuts might be interested in hearing about 
this, especially if you live in Austin, Texas....

Subject: Warning regarding Dealership and Service Center Towing

I have quite a story for you.  

I live in Austin, Texas. and, until Wednesday November 20th
I was the proud owner of a mint condition Red 1990 Carrera
2 with really low miles. 

I had a fender bender and took it to Lipshy Motorcars,
the only franchised Porsche Dealership in Austin as far
as I know. I thought that I was doing the best thing I 
could since it looked liked there would probably be
some painting involved, etc). The Service Advisor at 
Lipshy informed me that they do not have their own
body shop but that they always deal with a reputable
place in Austin.

I said that they should do whatever they normally do.

I got a call on November 21st from the Lipshy Service
Advisor who proceeds to tell me that my car was 
involved in another accident while being towed to the 
body shop. The car actually came off the straps as the 
wrecker turned into the body shop. The car continued 
through an intersection and was broad-sided by
a pickup truck going about 45 mph ! 

I went and looked at what was left of my once beautiful 
car, and believe me, it was not a pretty sight. 
Everything was bent and dented. I asked the body shop 
guy what would NOT have to be replaced and he replied, 
"the hood and a fender might make it".  I was pretty sure
the entire frame was twisted as well.

Well, it all gets worse. 

The good news (I guess you can call it that) is
that the car turned out to be a total loss. 
They are not going to attempt to repair it.

But the dealership, Lipshy Motorcars, is
completely shrugging off all responsibility
in my opinion!

It turns out that the wrecker company (Finger
Towing, Inc., also in Austin, TX) only had $10,000 
worth of coverage for the "cargo" they tow.  Now
this is alarming since Lipshy's Service Advisor
informed me that they have used this towing 
company exclusively for years.  By the way, they
put my car in a sling (as opposed to a flatbed
towtruck) !! I can only assume that mine was 
not the first Porsche they had submitted to 
such torture.

How many of you own Porsche's that are worth
less than $10,000?  That's what I thought.

Then, Lipshy Motorcars went and called MY INSURANCE
COMPANY without my permission and told them that 
my insurance would have to cover the car!  Yes,
I thought this was completely ludicrous also. But
it seems that my insurance company (State Farm)
has turned out to be, in my opinion, the only
party involved in this mess with a bit of ethics, 
not to mention business sense.

Speaking of, you would think that it would just 
make good business sense try and keep a customer 
happy, especially in this kind of situation were 
they obviously screwed up and didn't do their 
homework when it came to choosing a wrecker service.
But do you think they have gone out of their way 
to see that I am happy?  Hell no. I doubt they 
plan on ever calling me again to tell you the truth.

I had to go through my own insurance company just
to get a rental car. Since my insurance only covers
$20 a day,I thought the least Lipshy Motorcars could
do was to pick up the tab for a nice Volvo or
something. 

But NO!  The Lipshy Service Manager haggled with
me on the phone for 30 minutes as I sat at an
Enterprise Rent-a-car regarding the price of the
car I had rented.  As it turns out, he was willing
to pay $9 a day over what my insurance would pay
but not $18 a day to put me in a little nicer car.
He said that he felt that it was $9 a day they
weren't responsible for paying!  Hey, I mean even
the Volvo isn't my Porsche that was wrecked after
I dropped it off at Lipshy Motorcars.  It made me
want to puke to hear that guy wiggle on the
phone over $9 a day.  I wanted to ask him "This
is a PORSCHE DEALERSHIP I'm talking to, isn't it??!!"

At one point I mentioned that I had talked to an
attorney for advice who had told me that I was 
entitled to a comparable temporary car.  At this, 
the Lipshy Service Manager went and talked to the
General Manager of Lipshy Motorcars and when 
he came back  he  said that if I got an Attorney 
involved they would stop paying anything toward 
a rental and would have to stop talking with me.  
Sounded a bit like a threat to me.  Not to mention 
the part when he went on to say that "Mr. Lipshy
is involved in a lot more than just this dealership, 
he's very involved in Texas politics and he's very 
connected".

I didn't bother to ask what that was supposed to
mean.  Or how it was in any way related to the 
fact that I was still without my Porsche
that I had left in the care of Lipshy Motorcars.
Or the fact that it has now been taken to the scrap
yard.

He called me back a few days later and left a message
on my answering machine just to make sure that I 
had switched to the cheaper car.  I haven't heard
anything else from Lipshy Motorcars. 

Feel free to post this message where ever you think
it might serve as a good warning against dealerships
and service centers that haven't done their homework
and might not be willing to accept responsibility
for their actions.
