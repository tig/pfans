    Yes.

    Your objectives are admirable, but you may find it very
    difficult and/or expensive to achieve them.

    The area behind the roll bar is really nasty from an aerodynamic
    point of view... There's a strong low-pressure area over the
    engine lid and turbulent flow all the way back.

    I lobbied an SCCA tech inspector once to allow a GT-2 914/6 to
    run with its small rear spoiler (the only aerodynamic aid
    allowed in that class) mounted on top of the rollbar, rather
    than at the trailing edge of the rear trunk.

    The rules only stated that the spoiler must be mounted "behind
    the rear window", and the trailing edge of the rollbar is indeed
    behind the rear window, but I got a "Hell, no" response, anyway.

    Oh, well... I didn't really expect it to be allowed.

    Anyway...

    If I were in your place, had a limitless budget, and my car's
    bodywork were unconstrained by any rules, I'd cut the windshield
    and rollbar off the 914 and graft the top of a 911 in its place
    (or keep the 914 windshield -- maybe raking it back a little --
    and rollbar and just fabricate a gently-sloping and -tapering
    cover for the area between the back of the rollbar and the back
    of the trunk).  Then I'd spend some money for a real wing and
    hang it off the back of the car.

    Some means for getting air into the now-fully-enclosed engine bay
    would be necessary.  This would probably be accomplished through
    ducts cut in front of the rear fenders, but the really trick
    setup would be a duct on the roof (a la the 911 GT1 or McLaren
    F1)... Aside from looking really bitchin', such an arrangement
    might suck the boundary layer off the top of the car and keep it
    from getting real thick toward the rear.

    A couple of notes:

        1.  Aerodynamic tuning is real tricky and is extremely
            sensitive to seemingly-small details.  Having a set of
            wind-tunnel photos of a stock 914 is unlikely to be real
            productive; what you really need is a model of YOUR car
            that you can test in a tunnel yourself.

        2.  Your signature says "I'd rather be autocrossing".  If
            that's the intended use for your car, most of the
            passive aerodynamic aids will be somewhat less than
            useful, since they really don't start working until
            you've reached speeds well in excess of what you're
            likely to encounter in an autocross.

    Good luck... Let us know what you end up doing and whether you
    get any useful results.
