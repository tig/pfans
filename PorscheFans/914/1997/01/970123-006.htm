	Not amiss, they have not arived and I have been lazy about 
getting bills out. Pushing to get car ready for Serbering race.

I have found that the post office will ship the books for $3.00 2nd day, 
and include the packing, so if the book stays under 2 lbs. thats about as 
nice as it gets.  
My mail man said to expect 1 month from UK via "Surface" so the may be 
here soon
