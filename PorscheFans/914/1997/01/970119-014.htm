Jeff:

While it's true that the STOCK 2.7-liter motors have a deservedly bad 
reputation for pulling their head studs out, this problem can easily 
be remedied by installing either Raceware studs or -- although 
there's been some controversy about them lately -- the factory 
Dilivar studs.

The 3-liter and 3.2-liter engines are real nice, of course, but a 
914/6 conversion using either of those motors is likely to be VERY 
expensive... Especially if you live in a state (like California) that 
requires the finished conversion to meet the emissions requirements 
for the year of the ENGINE if it's newer than the car.

Even if emissions regulations aren't a problem for you, the 3.2-liter 
Motronic engines requires a lot of auxiliary hardware that's 
difficult and expensive to adapt to a 914.

The 2.0- and 2.2-liter engines are ok, but they don't make much
power even with mechanical injection... And the mechanical-injection
components don't fit very well under the 914 engine lid.

A drivable 2.0- or 2.2-liter engine making over 180 horsepower is a
real rarity.  2.7-liter motors, on the other hand, can easily make
210-240 horsepower with very few mods, and 260 HP is possible if you
don't mind a little peakiness in your powerband.

All the 914/6s running in the SCCA's GT-2 class use 2.9-liter engines
that are essentially bored-out 2.7's.  Built properly (with the new
studs, Carrera tensioners, and internal cooling mods), they're pretty
bulletproof even though they make in the area of 300 horsepower.

It costs just as much to build a 2.7-liter 914/6 conversion as to
build a 2-liter conversion... Why not go for the gusto?
