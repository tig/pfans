First, I have not received a digest for days now.  Anybody out there?

Second, I earlier posted a query about identifying some heads I have.  I 
got some responses, but they don't seem to match exactly.

The intake has two studs at each end and a hole in the center - which may 
have threads in it (I forgot to check).  It is clearly not 4 bolts of the 
VW or 1.7 or 1.8.

Yet, the exhaust ports are at the ends with long rectangular holes with 
two holes for bolts - thus suggesting back to the VW/1.7/1.8 - but no 4 
bolt intake.

Lastly, the heads are very rectangular.  That is each of the sides are 
perfectly straight and the corners are just slightly curved (like 1/4" 
deep).  I thought the VW heads I have seen were a little more rounded. 

Any more thoughts?  356?
