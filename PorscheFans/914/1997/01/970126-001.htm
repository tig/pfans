Hi 914-er's!

  In an issue of Aviation Week that I got a few weeks ago, there was 
an article in the new products section concerning a new oil additive.  
This additive was suggested for use in diesel engines powering ground 
support equipment at airports.
  This happened in the midst of the smog discussion, and I perked up 
my ears because the claimed benefit of this additive was not only 
reduced wear, but reduced emissions!  
  The additive in question was not PTFE, but our old friend, MoS2 
(Molybdenum DiSulphide).  The claim was that the MoS2 filled in 
microscopic gaps in the cylinder walls, improving sealing and reducing 
lubricating oil burn.

  I sent for more data using the reader service card, but I have not 
heard from them... it is possible that the request fell through the cracks, 
and so I guess I'll have to sort through the mess, find the right back 
issue, and get off a direct request.

  The question is, has anyone out there heard of anyone making or 
using an MoS2 oil additive in automobile engines?  What results?  Is 
the stuff applicable to the 914?

				Thanks in Advance,
				Jim T.
