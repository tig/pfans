I am looking at purchasing a '71 914-6 that doesn't run. 
The broker claims that it's complete and has "minimal" rust, 
mostly around the rear quarter panels.  The broker doesn't
seem to be sure of the selling price, but I have heard him
mention both $2200 and $2500, which seems to be a very good
price for this car.

I plan to put in a larger or modified six, or more likely trade 
the car for a 914-6 conversion (any Pfan interest?).   I'm not 
really interested in the restoring the car to its original condition, 
I just want to have something fun that's a lot faster than my 944, 
and I don't want to spend more than around $6k total (if that's 
possible).

Is it correct to say that some of the original 914-6 pieces 
can be expensive?  If so, what specific pieces should I be 
looking for when I go to inspect the car (besides looking
for rust)? 

Here's what I've got so far (please correct me if I'm wrong,
I feel a bit clueless here):

single engine mount
oil tank (where is it?)
exhaust
hubs
brakes
heat exchangers (what does it look like?)
engine sheet metal?


Thanks,
