Hello Once Again, Midminded ones:

On the running subject of 914 aerodynamics, Mike Cooley was so kind as to give
me a reference of a book.  Thanks Mike, I'll look that one up and order it from
Brooklands.

Regarding a rear wing, Andy Warren writes back, "What options are you
considering?"

I've seen everything from straight up over the rear axle line, all the way
around to hanging off the back, parallel with the trunk line.  Huge and small.

What I'm thinking of?  In reference to what I DO have (books mentioned
previously and a litlle more)  my supposition is that a full width wing,
multiple-element, large full fence, starting just above the end of the rear
trunk lid, LOOKS like the logical correctness.  Remember this Andy, paradigm
shift.  I understand the rules, but when I make the decision to bump up to a
more modified class, restrictions tend to go away, and the
wallet-filling-material becomes the restriction (not saying that mine is
limitless).  I'd also like to see what corner turning vanes mounted on the front
corners of the bumper area would do.

I'm obviously going to have to do some tuft testing with video camera and chase
car, to find actual effects on my car.  Especially in areas of low pressure
relief, when cutting relief slots in the WIDE fenders to stop the stall and move
the boundary layer along.

One other item for you, I'm working with a sixer, soon to be in my garage, which
will stay mostly near the GT-2 trim and regs you and I know about.  The one I'm
working on is a bare roll-cage, all out monster.

Regarding the roof.  My thoughts there are that multiple NASA ducts cut into the
rear of the roofline/lip may deflect downward and be helpful.  I'd like to know.
I have an extra roof to experiment with.  This is slightly different than your
proposal to "mount" a spoiler.  The NASA ductwork could be almost unseen,
artful, AND effective.  There's plenty of room to work with, clearance-wise,
back there.
