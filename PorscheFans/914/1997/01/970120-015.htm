  Finally out of wanne-be mode, had a 73 1.7L total rust out basket case
  that I took apart and stored/sold/junked this summer.  Finally found my
  73 2.0L project car this weekend.

  What kind of temps do those of you with gauges, original or add on, see.

  Oil temp
  Cylinder head temp
  also Oil pressure

  I have center console but only the voltmeter seems to be working. Oil
  temp gauge has no markings.

  The engine was suppose to be rebuild only about 200 miles ago, with 96mm
  P&C's.  It is clean enough that I believe it.  Want to get gauges
  working, add others but want to know what to expect.


  The car has 911 alloys on it, using wheel adapters.  I don't like
  adapters and would like to look into getting the hubs drilled for the 911
  pattern.  Anyone know a good place in Los Angeles to get this done, I'm
  in Pasadena.  Any other issues I should know about if switching from
  adapters to drilled hubs?

  Also need to replace the cracked windshield, any places near Pasadena?
  Price I can expect?

  Rims are painted to match car, a horrible shade of fuchsia, but that's
  another story ;-), original color was Alaska Blue Metallic.   For $2000 I
  can't complain too much.

  Now to track down all stuff to replace the FI system, it currently has
  Weber 44's.
