I second Gary's opinion to not go to carbs.  FI is where it's at.  

The motor mounts and whatnot might be a bit of a headache, if I remember
correctly.  The early 70-72 mounts are at the ends of the mount bar, and
the later mounts are in the middle between the motor and the bar.  However,
I'm sure the bar+mounts will bolt up to either case, since the cases are
identical. 

If you do the side-shifter conversion (highly recommended) then go with the
76 mounts+bar & linkage, and get the firewall adapter bushing from one of
the mail-order sources.

If it were my car, I would make sure I get the 2.0 FI and install it.  You
can keep the same fuel pump, but almost everything else is different, if I
remember correctly.  The injectors, MAP sensor, etc. are all different from
1.7 to 2.0

Cheers, Brian Ng
73 2.0 almost complete :)

ps keep the old motor for a core, and build it into a screaming 2.0:
counterweight the crank, add a mild FI cam, euro p&c and vrooom.
use the new heads & rods of course.

---------------

1. Are there any changes to the fuel system other than fuel pump?

2. If the 2.0L engine has been converted to non-FI, are there any
changes to the ignition system other than elimination of the FI brain?

3.  Will a '76 2.0L engine bolt to the engine supports without
modification?

4.  What difference in motor mounts between the 72 1.7L engine and a '76
2.0L?

5.  Any suggestions or opinions are welcome.
