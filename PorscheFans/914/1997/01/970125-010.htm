my euro gt came with a rear sway bar which i dutifully left connected
for 2 vintage racing seasons and i always marvelled at how the car would
spin unpredictably but as if it had a pole driven thru the center ...
then after an offtrack excursion at Thunderhill, i finally read the book
where it said "induces oversteer", popped off one link and haven't spun
out since.... wonder if connected could be an ADVANTAGE in autocrossing
when tossing the car around with throttle ?????  (of course I spun w/o
leaving course several times in autocross school under that theory...) 
anyway car is lots more predictable w/o it, but then i'm also running
original bushings that are now 27 yrs old..

a couple years back I noticed cracks in the panels around the stock
front bar mounts, so i converted to later sc control arms w/underslung
swaybar, keeping the as-purchased euro struts which Ken Mack says are
"trick" b'cuz they are apparently decambered enuf that the front can
barely be  positive cambered enuf to meet his "autocross" specs.. which
i use in racing since i also drive this critter on the street on nice
days

i run 7&8 by 16 BBS w/ 225/50 & 245/45 A008's per Ken's suggestion, and
find 26psi front, 27 rear to work about right, whereas 2psi more makes
the tires feel "greasy" & let go sooner
