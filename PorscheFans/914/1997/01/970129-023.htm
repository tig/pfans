I just got off the phone with the parts guy at Stoddard. VERY HELPFUL.

First, he was able to look up the recall bulletin for Campaign HO July
1977. It included the new battery cover and a number of items related to
fuel lines in the engine compartment. Sounds like they replaced all of the
lines from the fuel filter, fuel pump, cold start valve, fuel ring,
injectors, etc. NO mention of the fuel lines going through the tunnel to
the tank in front. Also items about keeping lines away from sheet metal.

Second, he looked up the two lines running through the tunnel. I had
previously posted the 9mm line 914.356.062.01 $74.75, and 7mm
914.356.063.00 $71.60. These were for up to '74 models. I had him look for
'75-76 models in the fiche and the part numbers are: 9mm 914.356.062.02
$74.75, and 7mm 914.356.063.01 $46.75. We couldn't tell if anything (such
as plastic vs metal) was different but the 9mm lines are the same price, so
I assume they are the same plastic but somehow different for the front
mounted fuel pump. The smaller line is different and a lower price. All
parts are current in the computer and should be available.

SO...

Sounds like the later lines for front mounted pumps and good high pressure
hose for the engine compartment lines is the answer. That is unless you
want to go with metal lines in the tunnel as was suggested in an earlier
posting.
