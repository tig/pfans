The ideal, save for a little added weight, would be to send them out 
for powder coating.  It adds a little helpful insulation as well as 
rust prevention.  My neighbor is in the powder coat business, so I had 
him do all the upper tin and fan housing on my '73 in white.  It sure 
makes for better visibility in that dark hole..  I was in too much a 
hurry to have him do it for my '76 when I rebuilt it a couple of years 
ago.  Now that you remind me, I will ask him to do an extra set of tin 
I have.
