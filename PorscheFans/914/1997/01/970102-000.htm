I once had a crusty old customer who would call in a dither and ask for 
Rick, or Dick, or who knows what.  He finally settled on calling me 
Rickydick.  I would have let it die, but my wife gets a kick out of it 
(don't know just why.)  When I first signed on to the net 18 months 
ago, it asked for an 8 character username, which I did not know would 
go to the world.  Once it got there, I just left it.  This will come in 
handy when I change service provider in the coming month, as I'm sure 
there is no other rickydik.  

Netcom is going out of the consumer business.  Does anybody know a good 
ISP with local phone lines all over the country?  I travel a lot.

I post with abandon to some ng, so the name RD Rick is not quite right.
My opinions need to be kept from being construed as being those my 
employer, which is a large supplier of avionics in the airliners.

As a Field Engineer, my duty is to keep the airlines happy with the 
equipment of ours they are flying.  I cover the West from Alaska to 
Panama.  It is a great career, but I pay more for parking at LAX than 
fuel and repairs for my 914.  I have worked in electronics or sales 
ever since beginning ham radio at age 15.  My job for the last 20 years 
combines both.

Finally speaking of 914's, it is very interesting learning about the 
individuals and types who own and repair them.  Why the prevalence of 
long hair?  Is it a total throwback to the seventies?  Even my 29 year 
old son who is a student at Cal State Montery Bay has long hair more 
often than not.  He drives my '73 HiPerf Commuter 914.  I'm glad there 
is a good representation of us pre-war types in the group; I'm 56.

I thank you all for responding.  It took me forever to get through them 
all.  The co. sent me a new Gateway 2000 laptop the day before Xmas 
break, so I spent days getting it loaded with 16,000 files.  I hate W95 
so far.  Like so many things, they did the hard parts good, and the 
simple parts are neglected.  I ended up using dos Xtree to load the 
last 300 files that were dropped from the backup tapes.  Yes Tim, that 
was your competitor's sw.  The co. provided it before I met you last 
year.

Bought my first 914 in '79.  Got rearended in '93 and replace with 
what?  Another '73 914.
I am not generally outgoing, or a clubbie, but I have met a few of you 
fine folks in my travels, and even had one guest here at my home on Old 
Pirate Lane in Huntington Beach, Calif.  Been here 23 years with my 
first wife of 34 years.  I keep telling her she is my first wife, just 
to keep her on her toes and tolerant of my projects, which include:

    76 914 2.0 stock commuter - my present commuter
    73 914 2.1 hiperf commuter - at CSUMB with #1 son
    81 Vanagon: general hauler and daily use by #2 son

The following are in some state of incapacitation and awaiting 
attention:
    46 Bellanca Cruisair; low wing retractible taildragger with 165hp   
        Franklin aircooled engine.
    34 Franklin Olympic sedan with 100hp inline six aircooled.
    51 VW pan covered by a 58 Devin kit body: one of the very first.

I could go on, but I think you get the picture..
Happy New Year
RD
