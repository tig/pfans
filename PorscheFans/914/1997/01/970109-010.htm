Well, I managed to take my 75 914 1.8 to the shop just before New Years
to get the smog dealt with as my adjustments resulted in failure the
first time thru. I did valves adjusting, new plugs, new points,
condenser, rotor and cap. Wires were great. 
At German Auto Clinic (seattle) they told me I needed a new throttle
switch which they replaced and put it all back together. It passed and I
got it registered and switched the title to me. The cost: $187 for the
repairs and $152 for the title transfer, tabs and new plates.
A couple of days later, it started to die at idle at intersections and
the like. Since my alternator and battery are strong, I had no problem
getting it started each time, but how annoying! So I cranked the screw
on the throttle body housing while the car was warm and got it to idle a
little faster and know it doesn't die, but I wonder if this was the right
thing to do. I also replaced the vacuum line from the throttle housing to
the vacuum advance on the distributer with a good quality rubber hose
(Don't you hate that cloth stuff?) The car runs well at speed, but the
idle still bounces the tack up and down a bit and I'm not even sure all
the vacuum lines are in the right place. Any insights or advice?

My only other problem is the gas smell in the car. I replaced the
deteriated cloth lines under the fuel tank with high pressure rubber
types and still no good. The tank itself is not leaking and I'm starting
to wonder if the "breather" line from the top of the tank that exits the
car underneath might be at fault.The fuel pump is sealed well and the
filter is one of those square ones and it does not leak. I cleaned up
under the tank and left the hood open all day to vent the fumes after
ward. The engine compartment has no gas leaks (thank the gods) and the
smell is only bad in the morning when the car has been sitting by it's
lonesome all night. Has anyone had this problem? I need to know where
all the lines go--they exit the tank underneath. There is one line to
the pump/ filter and the other one goes where? I'm guessing under the
driver side rocker panel. 

Thanx in advance,
Nick@Samsar@juno.com
