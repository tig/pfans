Hi 914-er's!

  I seem to remember a Tech Tip in Automotion's catalog regarding a 
fuel line recall, and I just found it, on page 142.
  It is reproduced below:

  "The 914 fuel line recall program is still active.  It is designed to 
prevent fuel line failure and a very dangerous fire hazzard.  We urge 
any 914 owner who has not had his fuel lines upgraded to call his local 
Porsche dealer about this program.  As long as your engine's hoses 
have never been upgraded, you're eligible.  If the dealer doesn't know 
about it, tell them to call the Factory representative."

  Now, I'm at a loss to know exactly what this is all about.  They 
mention the word "line(s) three times, and the word "hoses" once.  I 
wonder which they mean?
  I would assume that they mean the rubber hoses that interconnect the 
fuel injection rails, the fuel pressure regulator, etc.... But, just in case 
they mean the plastic lines... why spend all that money and do all that 
work when Porsche might do it for you for free?
  Does anyone know in detail what this recall is all about?

				Thanks in Advance,
				Jim T.
