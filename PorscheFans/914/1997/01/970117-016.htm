For Dirk Wright and other interested parties:

  $29. / qt!!!   OUCH!!!   I don't know about the outside of the car, 
where one has to take paint adherance and such into consideration, 
but when it comes to just plain excluding the water from chassis repairs 
in hidden areas, I'm sure that any good laytex caulk will work just fine. 
  I used an entire tube of it to fill in the area around my right tail light, 
because the light fixture itself is missing most of it's rim, and I don't want 
any more rust.  I'll probably have to destroy the light completely to 
remove it, but by that time, it will need replacement anyway.   
  Most of this stuff is rated to last 25 - 40 years, and thats in U.V. 
exposure, freezing, summer heat, etc.  Once it's cured, I doubt that any 
common automotive fluid will faze it.  As for fumes, if the stuff stands up 
to California smog and sunlight simultaneously on a house, it ought to 
do just fine in a car.
  The only thing that I would avoid is the RTV based stuff... this stuff 
has acetic acid in it, which comes off during the curing process, and 
can cause further rust.  Get the laytex stuff... it isn't rated to last quite 
as long, but it won't harm the metal.
				Good Luck,
				Jim T.
