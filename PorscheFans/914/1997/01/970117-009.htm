On 1-16-97, Bill Newlin writes, "I have the fastest 914 around. Overall track
record at Buttonwillow, class track records for last 14 years at Sears Point,
Laguna Seca, Thunderhill, and TTOD 1992 Porsche Parade by 4 sec over "914-6
monsters" and 450 other cars.  1500 lbs, 67" X 12" chord wing. Currently have a
72" X 12" brand new fiberglass (guards red) for sale $400.00 F.O.B.  Weighs
approx 7 lbs. Has gloss black fences similar to WSC designs. Also have 25lb
1-piece front end available at $650.00 each. Similar to 962 design but fits a
914!
Interested?  
Why are you fussing with the roof. Aero bummer and heavy junk. Ditch it. Bugs in
your teeth, wind in your hair, and faster lap times should be your basic goals."

You. Yyyooooooouu.  I knew you'd surface sooner or later.  You've gotta like a
guy with so much humbleness :-)  I'm going to scan a pic of your car into my
screen saver right now, I'm so impressed :-)

I grabbed your post as I left work last night, I ran home and pulled out my SEP
92 Pano.  There's our little humble post-person (Bill Newlin), stomping the
competition, on page 24, and smiling about it on page 34, and what a big grin he
has :-)

OK, you have a mind similar to mine.  As a starting point, to avoid confusing
you, I've stated to the other responders that I'm talking about two vehicles
simultaneously.

I am in the process of getting a GT-2 914-6, before winter is out, I believe
I'll have it here (purchasing it from a friend in the Carolinas).  I don't plan
on doing any more than utilizing it to get in my fix of a need for speed (I've
been away long enough to fund a growing family, and we're about to become
empty-nesters - back to slab time at the track :-]  ).

The other 914, I've had for too long (and have been taking that amount of time),
to build into something like yours.  My original sketches and engineering
drawings were done in '89, after I purchased the heap in '88.  I am building up
a fully triangulated frame, which will look similar to the tube versions you see
under the likes of 908s, 917s and such.  I lopped of the WHOLE roof immediately.
In fact, it looks like YOU have excess roll bar material - a matter of opinion
:-)  .  Less roll bar, more bugs in the teeth, that's the goal, right Bill !?
My rear section is a one-piece affair, and looks similar to the shape of yours.
More on my one-piece nose later.  I'm just hooking up my TIG welder in the
garage, and I have the frame cut down to the BARE minimum.  I'll talk about
engine & tranny (another paradigm shift) as I get nearer completion.

Your winning record is certainly admirable.  Just because you've won, doesn't
mean the aerodynamic applications are correct, or to someone else's
liking/abilities.  BTW, the car may be good, but you make up a big part of the
equation.  And it IS a car set up to suit your particular finger print of
driving abilities.  We have all read the stories of how other drivers can't
handle the set up of say an A. Senna or M. Schumacher and visa versa.  So you
have a good set up for YOU.  Could you go out and duplicate Kevin Buckler's or
Larry Schumacher's record in their cars, or would you need to change them to fit
your style/ability?  My question remains, how did you arrive at the wing you
have, where you placed it exactly, and how do you know it works?  Why isn't it
multi-element?  How do you know it isn't a real stone?  How do you know you
placed it in the right place, relative to the rest of the bodywork?

The front-end nose that I see on page 24, is not the optimum that designers look
for. Why?  It is convex in shape (a little less blunt, but essentially the same
curve as a 914 nose), instead of concave.  Did you do some testing to arrive at
a shape that does work, and which defies initial observation (that IS possible,
it happens all of the time).  Or, did you just do a nice piece of fiberglass
layup that met your artistic palate?

The only pic I have of your car is page 24.  Did you lop off the back of the
rear wheel well for pressure relief advantages, and you have proof that there is
an advantage to doing that?  Why did you go to a non-sliding fence for a boxed
running board?

Did you ever consider that the stock shape of the roll bar could incorporate a
mid-body multiple-element adjustable wing?  I'm not going that direction, I want
that smooth across-the-top flow, like you have.  But it's a thought, for those
who do have to, or want to keep the original looking roll bar.  For those HAVING
to keep the stock category original roof line, the multiple NASA ducts cut into
the rear of the roof is a possible new move to change the poor pressure
situation around the engine lid.

To answer your question about your front nose piece, I have an original Kremer
K5 one-piece, I pulled out of the original bucks.  If you have Joseph Katz's
"New Dimensions in Race Car Aerodynamics", look on page 19, Figure 1-30.  That
is a good friend of mine's car (Sam Shalala, with Frank Beard driving).  Other
pics can be found in the Jun 93 "Excellence Magazine", on pages 88 & 89.  I have
a nose, from the same bucks he used to make that nose, he bought the bucks.  In
that pic, you'll notice that IMSA made him remove the bottom front horizontal
lip, the curling fences going up over the fender line, and they didn't let him
cut out the relief slots over the wheel arches.  IMSA knew what downforce could
be generated by this nose and they trimmed Sam way back.

I however have all of those features and more.  No, I will not divulge the exact
numbers (claiming ignorance) but I do know that this nose really works the
downforce numbers.  For instance, you know what pressure levels that springs are
at on a full race car like this.  Well, when Sam came in after the first laps
with this nose on, he said that the nose was firmly planted down on its stops,
and still pushing down more.  We got seven guys in the shop to stand huddled on
top of the frame, back at the shop, and we couldn't get it to bottom out like
that, standing still.

I am so glad you came out of the woodwork.  There are a couple others I've
noticed over the years, but you're the only other nut I've seen who lopped off
the WHOLE top.
Let's keep talking.  Can you send me any other pics?  What have you updated
since that page 24 picture?

Your 2 wings sound interesting, but I have the ability to fabricate, thank you
for the offer.


Gotta get back to work.
