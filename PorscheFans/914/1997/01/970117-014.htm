You probably made the right decision, but for the right person, this could
be a bonanza. Anyone who has converted a four into a six soon learns the
value of the genuine six parts. When you account for things like the five
bolt suspension parts (including the elusive stub axles) , the oil tank and
piping system, the engine sheet metal, Webers, (unrusted real six heat
exchangers? ... not very likely...) $2,500 may not be too bad. Use this
bucket for the parts, find a solid no-rust 1.7 or 1.8 California car and
many man-hours of work and you might have just saved some money.
