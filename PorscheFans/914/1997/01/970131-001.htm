James.....As a member of The Porsche 914 Club I will be happy to clairify the
event information posted on the club's web site.  The omission of dates was
an oversight and I can understand how confusing that might be for a new
member or non-member.  Details of all of the Clubs activities are published
in the Twin Trunks Tribune.  Please accept my appology for the Club and
thanks for letting us know.  We will be happy to update the Event & Club News
postings.
As you know, The Porsche 914 Club is a non-profitt organization and the club
members are the organizers of the quarterly madazine, put togather events on
the West Coast and Mid West and develop and maintain the Club's web site.
 They are contributing their time because they want to for the love of the
914, not because it puts income in their pocket.  The club would like to see
more members involved in organizational support and I personally would love
to see an East Coast event developed.
My past involvement with other clubs was soured by a lack of interrest from
the proprietor and an absence of member involvement.  Hopefully the Porsche
914 Club will be filled with involved members such as youself.   
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the Club, becomming a
member or findind out more about the Clubs event plans for '97.  I can be
reached at (972) 517-1167 or e-mailed at A914Guy@aol.com.  Currently members
are voting on locations for this years events.  Many have already cast their
votes for the Mid West Renegade Festivals location and time.  I look forward
to meeting you and possibly some of the other Porschefans at one or both of
these events.
