Hi 914-er's!

  Regretably, I must post a criticism:  The following is a classic example 
of how NOT to post a notice of an event... I downloaded it from the 
Renegade Porsche web page.

The Porsche 914 Club's
Sixth Annual 914 Renegade Festival

California

"The Porsche 914 Club convenes for its annual tribute to Dr. Porsche's 
mid-engine classic in the central coast town of San Luis Obispo, 
California. Enjoy the car show Saturday, continental breakfast, fun 
ralley, tech session, parade and awards banquet, or just lounge around 
by the pool and spa. Festival headquarters and check-in on Friday 
evening (or Thursday evening for the Thursday night local farmers' 
market and BBQ) is at the Sands Motel at 1930 Monterey Street in San 
Luis Obispo. 
Friday daytime activities (for those who arrive Thursday) will include a 
surprise tour. Please call the Sands Motel directly for reservations at 
(800) 441 - 4657. Rooms are made available to the 914 Club at special 
rates between $58 to $72*. Hope to see all of you with your shiny 
914s!"
Please bring a Porsche-Related item for the silent auction.
* This price is held only through May 15 so please reserve early.
Registration: $30 Late Registration: Additional $10 
Saturday Night Dinner:
___prime rib, ___ BBQ chicken, ___ char-broiled salmon X $25/dinner
BBQ lunch Sunday at winery, tri-tips ___ X $9/lunch

E-mail:  johnp@outright.com


  You will notice the absence of any sort of date... there is a deadline 
date of May 15 for motel reservations, and that's it.  Note that entries in 
the events sections of the various web pages tend to hang around for 
awhile after the event occurs; not posting an event date, with the year 
means that no one, with the possible exception of the event organizers, 
has the slightest idea of when the get-together is supposed to take 
place.

  I have no idea whether this event is past history, or scheduled to 
occur sometime around May of '97 (or May of 2001, for that matter!).

  I have sent a request to the E-mail address given without any reply for 
 going on two weeks now.  Does anyone on the list know whether this 
event is past or future?  If future, exactly when is it?

  I think I might like to attend, provided I don't have to trade my 914 in 
for a DeLorean time machine (as in Back to the Future!).

				Thanks,
				Jim T.
