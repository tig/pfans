Subject: Boxter?=20

I've been reading a bunch of posts on the other lists
from 911 driver's who've just discovered that putting the engine
in the middle isn't so bad after all.  But, I'm not a 911 driver
so I can't relate very well. =20

	I'd really like to hear how it compares to a 914.  Any of
you's-guys driven a Boxter?  Is the handling similar to a 914? =20

	Thanks! =20


	Wishing I could afford one,

So do I, wishing i could afford one or two or=85=85=85..

Hi all 914 friends, for some days ago Anand asked if anyone has driven the=
=20
Boxster, I must say that I have. In the first week in November 96, I had a=
=20
Boxster for testing in Sweden, I dove it on the high way (220 Km/h), on the=
=20
"Porsche road" (my "own" testing road), normally 90 km/h road and last but=
=20
not least on the racing track. Normally I  drive my Chevy Pick UP, S10-95 or=
=20
my 914/4-71 on this road/track.  I must say that I have never drove anything=
=20
like it, it feels like my 914 but faster. It had the same handling. On the=
=20
race track I provoked the Boxster to spin, just to see if the handling were=
=20
the same, oh yes it was. Put something through the middle of the car and=20
here we go, this was fun as ride on the roundabout. The day on the race=20
track, was it wet, but after one hour in the Boxster, we had the same time,=
=20
that my friend has in his 944 Turbo Cup 1988, so now I just wait to the new=
=20
Boxster with the 3.0 l engine, 18" of wheels, yellow, sport packet and=20
rollbars. We shall see, I=92m just starting to save some money, and then I=
=20
have my 914-6 GT 1971 in restoration also.

The Boxster that I and my son drove was a standard with the only option TC,=
=20
(Traction control). The only fault that I fond was at high speed 170 km/h=20
and over the Boxster was understeer, But this thing I can Live whit.
