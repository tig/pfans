	Very good first step when chasing a fuel system problem--make
sure the ignition system is up to snuff.  Double check the timing and
dwell, too--if you can.

	The idle bouncing up and down is called a "lean hunt".  It indi-
cates a lean fuel mixture (not enough gasoline), at least at idle.  The
most popular cause of it in 1.8L 914s (with the stock fuel injection
system) is vaccuum leaks.  The L-Jetronic FI system figures out how much
fuel to squirt in by measuring directly how much air comes into the
engine.  This is done with the air-flow meter that is bolted to the air
cleaner housing.  Any air that comes into the intake after the meter is
air that the FI system doesn't know about, and doesn't add fuel for.
This is also called "false air", BTW.
	Possible areas for vaccuum leaks include:  All the vaccuum hoses.
This includes the four big ones (AKA "manifold boots") that connect the
Intake Air Distributor to the intake runners.  The rubber "donuts" around
the fuel injectors.  The seal from the intake runners to the heads.  The
gasket (I think there is one) between the throttle body and the Intake Air
Distributor.  The oil filler cap seals.  The cork gasket between the oil
filler/breather thing and the crankcase.  Probably more that I'm forget-
ting.
	You may be able to compensate for this false air at the air-flow
meter.  However, this would just be masking the real problem and would be
a temporary "band-aid" at best.  There's a screw in the top surface of the
air-flow meter (may be covered by a cap of some sort) that tweaks the
mixture.  It mostly effects idle mixture, but may effect part-throttle mix
as well.  The screw works by letting more or less air past the sensor
mechanism without affecting the sensor.  Tighten the screw for less air
bypassing the sensor (richer mixture).  Loosen the screw for more air by-
passing the sensor (leaner mixture).

	As for where the vaccuum lines "really" go, that is a bit more
problematical.  Auto Atlanta sells diagrams for a moderately small amount
of money, or will throw in the diagram when you buy a kit of pre-cut hose
for your car.  That will probably cost more than buying all the hose for
yourself, but you don't have to cut and measure and you do get the diagram.
I have a text description of the layout of someone's 74 1.8L.  I don't know
what the differences are (if any) between 74 and 75, and I don't know for
sure that the layout as described is correct--but you can have it regard-
less.  It will be in a direct-mail message to spare the list the bandwidth.

	I don't know for sure on the 75-6 models, but I *think* they're
like the 70-74 ones.  The fuel lines eventually connect to "hard" plastic
lines that run through the center tunnel of the car.  One is for fuel de-
livery from the pump, and the other returns excess fuel from the engine to
the fuel tank.
	Replacing these is a fairly major undertaking.

	Don't know about your leak.  In other cars (911, 944) I've heard
of the sender for the gas gauge leaking sometimes, or the gasket around it.
I think that's pretty tough to get to in our cars, though.
	You're starting off right by checking out the rubber hoses.  When
you replace them, make sure that whatever hose you use is rated for AT
LEAST 50 PSI.  Normal operating range is about 35 PSI (and varies with the
manifold pressure), but you *do* want a safety margin.

	Good luck!
