> According the "factory window sticker" for my 73 2.0 it is a "914
Convertable"

According to the American Heritage Dictionary (1992 edition):

   roadster -- An open automobile having a single seat in the front for two
or three people and a rumble seat or luggage compartment in the back.

   convertible -- Having a top that can be folded back or removed: a
convertible automobile.

So, both convertible and roadster are correct when referring to a 914.
Convertible is most likely used in the official model descriptions because
that is the more general description. The distinction of calling it a
roadster over just a convertible is more for the nostalgic, romantic image
than a practical difference. For those poor saps with only one luggage
compartment, who really cares if it is in the front or back!

This also explains why cars like the 914 and Z3 are called 'roadsters,' but
other small open top two seaters like 911 Targa or Cabriolet are not --
they don't have a luggage compartment in the rear.

For an interesting perspective, I also checked the 1938 edition of the
Twentieth Century Dictionary Unabridged. 1938 is the year Ferdinand Porsche
began manual production of the Beetle and the cornerstone was laid for the
Volkswagen factory in Wolfsburg (where 30 years later the 914 would go into
production). It did not have any automobile related definition for
convertible, but it defines a roadster as 'A bicycle, tricycle, or
automobile built for road use instead of racing or exhibition purposes.'
