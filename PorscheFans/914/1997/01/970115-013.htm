Dirk:

You could use adhesive caulk but speaking from experience, it will seal the
seams but it just might seal in water.  Seam sealers have special chemicals
that somehow remove water while sealing.  Some of them are fairly
expensive, but in the long run isn't your 914 worth it?  Call one of many
Porsche parts aftermarket places.  The best stuff you can get is Wurth's
Brushable Seam Sealer (about $29 for a quart).  Order it and have it
shipped.  No hassle man!
