I have just liability on my car right now, but I'll add comprehensive 
when it gets back on the road. I want to keep it insured so I can check 
that box on my state tags yearly renewal. Anyway, my usual insurance 
company, NationWide, won't even insure Porsches - none of them. I had to 
go through a state run insurance program to even get liability. To 
simplify my life, I only want to deal with one insurance agent, so I was 
stuck buying this insurance. I did call around and the price was about 
the same, so I'm not gettign ripped. The strange part is that my 
insurance is higher because of my wife (really fiancee). She has a ticket 
and had an accident in my old truck. She's not listed as a co-driver or 
co-owner, either. According to the insurance agents, the fact that we 
live together makes her record affect my insurance rates. Insurance is a 
racket, sanctioned by the state. It's just about the only industry not 
subject to the anti-monopoly and colusion laws passed in the early part 
of this century.
