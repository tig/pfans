Hello! I am new to the porsche world (actually dont have a porsche yet, 
but I'm trying!) but I have been reading this list for a while now. I 
have decided that a 914 is what I want. I am, however kind of cash poor 
at the moment. What I would like to do is trade my last project for a 
914. I have a 1946 Willys CJ-2a jeep. I have almost completed an 
extensive re-build on the jeep. It has been converted to a Buick 231 
V-6, 12 volts , has a Warn O.D. unit, all new body (white) modern 
steering with tilt column and modern switchgear. The only thing left to 
do is re-build the transmission. I have lost interest in the project, 
european cars are my true love anyway. Anyway, I think I want a 914. 
Ideally, I would like a 73-74 2.0 but I would entertain any offers.
wanna trade or know someone who might ? reply here or email to 
Brian@deirks.org 
Help a guy enter the porsche world!
thanks!
Brian Dierks
