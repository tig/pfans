Again, thanks for all the advice. Not only was it a big help with the
immediate problem, but it also taught me a lot more about my car!

As of tonight, my 914 is running again.  Still no idea what caused the
original problem -- maybe it was water condensation in a bad place. But
I'll probably never know. Whatever it was has gone. Best theory is that it
was pouting because I took my *other* car to the family gathering and left
the 914 all by its lonesome on Christmas.

The lingering 'won't start' problem turned out to be simple -- I was
following poor instructions on the charger and not *fully* charging the
battery after my repeated attempts to start the car. 

My 914 needs *lots* of amps to crank when the temp is below 50 degrees and
it hasn't been driven for a week. It appears that the battery I have needs
to be at peak charge to start the car under those circumstances.

Soooooo... looks like time to upgrade to the highest amp battery that can
fit in the car. Any suggestions?

Derek (73 914 2.0 [Happy Happy Joy Joy - Its Running Again!], Atlanta GA)
