OK, there are 2 "S" shaped tubes, and 2 "J" shaped tubes. Also, each side 
has a control valve and length of flexible air hose. The control valves 
mount on the 2 heater ducts in the rocker panels, and are controlled by 
wires from the lever on the shifter tunnel inside the car. The flex hose 
connects to the control valve at one end and to the heat exchanger outer 
opening at the other. Each "S" shaped tube has 2 inlets and 1 outlet. The 
outlet connects to the heat exchanger inner opening. The "S" shaped tubes 
are different for the right and left, as are the "J" shaped tubes. The 
"J" shaped tubes connect to one of the inlets to the "S" shaped tube, and 
protrudes up throught the engine tin, where the flex hose from the 
electric fan connects to it. The other inlet for the "S" shaped tubes 
connects to the engine cooling fan at the bottom of the housing. There 
should be a one way flapper valve on each side of the housing to prevent 
the electric fan from pushing air into the engine fan, thus prevening you 
from getting any heat. The parts only assemble one way, and all of them 
are available from Stoddard (http://www.stoddard.com). The way this 
system works is liek this: when you crack the heater control valves just 
a bit (without turning on the electric fan), the output from the engine 
cooling fan is ducted throught the heat exchangers into the passenger 
compartment. When the valve is closed the heat is ducted outside, under 
the car. When you crank all the way on the lever, the electric fan turns 
on, and air from this fan then goes throught the exchanger into the 
passenger compartment. The one way flaps onthe engine cooling fan close 
from the air pressure of the electric fan. 

This complicated system has a few flaws. One of them is that hot air 
exhaust from the passenger side heater control valve exits directly on 
the fuel pump, causing vapor lock in warm weather. One solution is to 
move the pump up front under the gas tank. 

I'm planning on simplifying the system by removing the heater control
valves (80$ each - mine were extremely rusty), connecting the outlet of
the exchnagers directly to the built-in heater ducts, and closing off the
engine cooling fan outlet. The result would be that only air would blow
through the exchangers when the electric fan would be on, and that the air
pressure to cool the engine would increase (because it wouldn't be pumping
air through the exchangers all the time). This may or may not be a good 
idea. Cooling off the exhaust pipes reduces power output (due to less 
good exhaust scavanging), but runnig them hotter may either shorten thier 
life or make the exhaust valves run hotter, or both. I imagine that if 
the heat exchangers don't have any air blowing through them, then the 
trapped air inside would be a pretty good insulator, making for some 
really hot exhaust, but keeping the rest of the engine cooler. Hmmm...
