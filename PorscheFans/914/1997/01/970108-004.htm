First, I haven't seen a lot of mail either.  It's not 914 "season",
so many may be resting.  (Actually, I thought I killed it with
my get to know you message.)


I'm going to guess on the heads.  914 heads have studs at all
locations.  Yours could have had studs, and they came out.

914 exhaust ports exit down from near the ends of the heads.  912/356
exhaust ports exit out from the ends of the heads. (As memory serves)

You might want to check with the tail-engine guys to see what
you've got.  And there should be a part number somewhere
in the casting.

Gary.
