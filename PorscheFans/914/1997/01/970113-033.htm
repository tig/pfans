I have a 914-6 track car with a 2.4L motor and 915 transmission.  I'm 
using a Patrick competition cable shifter.  I'm having quite a bit of 
problem executing clean 2nd to 3rd up-shifts, and 5th to 4th 
down-shifts.  

From 2-->3 one of three things happen:

  o     I make the shift successfully (50%)
  o     I can't find any gear (25%)
  o     I get 5th instead of 3rd (the rest)

Since most tracks have their slowest turn preceding the longest 
straight, so this shifting problem is killing my lap times.  This is 
also killing me on slow rolling starts.  I've resorted to staying in 3rd 
and taking my lumps rather than missing the shift.

From 5-->4 I either hit it or end up in no-man's land (25%).  This isn't 
as big of a problem, because I usually have time to try again without 
impacting my lap time (as I coast into a high speed corner - gasp).

I live in the Phoenix area, and have already had the adjustment checked 
by Patrick Motorsports.  I have also double checked the clutch 
adjustment to ensure that it's engaging cleanly.

Is there an inherent problem with 915 transmissions or with the cable 
shifter?  Any potential problems I should be investigating?  Anyone 
having luck with a similar set-up?

Any suggestions will be appreciated...  Thanks,

Mike Schmidt
