Tommy:

This is going to sound commercial, but...  I am assisting with the planning
of this event and I believe that it is going to be the best one ever.  I
have heard some comments (from the late Porschephiles) that the West coast
reunion was really bad.  Just to let you know, some of the events planned
are: Lapping day at Road Atlanta, Tech sessions, a parade and picnic, a
wash and shine session, and a swap meet.  Some tenative events are: a road
rally in the north GA mountains, an autocross, a drivers school, and an
awards banquet and cocktail party.  We have surveyed about 18,000 914
owners on our mailing list and compiled the above results.  If you would
like to add your two cents, please feel free.  With everyones' imput, we
can make it a weekend that will be enjoyable.  If you want more details
(through snailmail) as they come, you may send me your name address and I
will include you in future mailings.

As far as the 914 Owners Association.  It is a strong group of real
enthusiasts.  In the Quarterly newsletter, there are informative articles
and specials for many parts warehouses.  For more info contact Dennis
Deeds: deeds@earthlink.com.
