Hi 914-er's!

  Tried to lite the 914 off this afternoon for the first time since last 
summer, having finally gotten it back together far enough to try.  I 
actually got it to run, BUT.... It was running really rough, so I started 
pulling plug wires to find out who was making a contribution, and who 
wasn't.  Turned out to be running on two cylinders, #'s 3 and 4.  The 
entire left bank was kaput.
  After more than a little investigation, because I didn't believe the 
answers I was getting, I finally resigned myself to the fact that BOTH 
injectors on the left side were bad.
  Now comes the interesting part.  All of the injectors were cleaned out 
with spray can style carburettor cleaner months ago, and verified for 
proper valve operation using a bench power supply.  They were then 
stored away until final engine assembly, and then waited some more 
while I got all the plumbing and other things together.
  On start-up today, both were stuck shut.  I managed to get both of 
them to leak by reverse pressurizing them with compressed air, and half 
open is where they stayed... neither passing enough air to be fully 
open, nor holding back enough to be considered shut, and no clicking 
from the armature, as if they were frozen internally.

  Now, the questions...  Has anyone else used carburettor cleaner on 
their injectors?  Were you sucessful?  Are there any plastic parts inside 
that coud be ruined by the witch's brew that passes for carb cleaner?   
If the carb cleaner is responsible for the problem, why did it affect only 
two of the four injectors; they all had the same treatment?  Has anyone 
else had an injector go bad just sitting around?  Is water intrusion a 
possible culprit?  (No signs of rust or water on the nozzle tips of the 
bloody things.)

  Any comments would be appreciated.

			Thanks in Advance,
			Jim T.
