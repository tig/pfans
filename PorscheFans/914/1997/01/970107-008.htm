Just so *everyone* knows.

A '75-'76 914 will NOT pass "Smog-II" with a Bursch muffler.

If the Cat's missing, it no pass.

The technique is to lean it out enough to get the HC down, and
let the Cat take care of the CO.

And yes it would be "rude" to put a stock muffler on once every
two years.  And never, never think about pooling a few bucks
with your friends to get one to share.
