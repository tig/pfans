>>From my Automobile Atlanta catalog, page 4, quote, "Our Porsche car=20
>>sales department sells nothing but Southern rust free vintage Porsches =

>>ready to drive to your home anywhere."  end of quote.

>The "nothing but " meaning from my World Book Dictionary is "only". So=20
>a person who purchases a 914, no matter what, should expect a rust free =

>914 from Automobile Atlanta even if it has rust in any form.

Mike, You make some good points.=20

But I would equally question a) a seller promising that a 20+ year old =
car had absolutely no rust, and b) a buyer _believing_  a 20+ year old =
car could positively have no rust.

This is another of what our parents told us about under the heading 'if =
it sounds too good to be true....' Next thing we know someone from =
Hawaii will attempt 'to drive to your home anywhere' and sink a 914 off =
the California coast.=20

Vague, sweeping marketing statement mean nothing. If you want anyone to =
guarantee (not just imply) the car you buy will be rust-free, then get =
in writing what period of time (forever, 1 year, 6 months) and what =
remedies (money back, repair or replace) in the purchase agreement.

However, a complaint is always an opportunity for a business to win back =
a customer (or more, considering how many of us are watching the drama =
unfold).
