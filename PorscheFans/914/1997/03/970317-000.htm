Uh oh.  This is something that I've never heard of.  When I rebuilt my
engine the last time, we put a thin metal ring in-between each of the
cylinders and the case, and another in-between the cylinders and the
head.  Then we just bolted everything down.  We never did any gluing.  I
haven't noticed any leaks, but I think this may become another one of
those "while I'm at it" things...  Can you give me more information on
this gluing process?

.... and yet another thing to go on the "while I'm at it" list.  Could
you give me some more information here, as well?

This I can do.  I'll let you know soon.

I have a feeling that I'm going to have to pull the barrels for one
reason or another.  I've got a friend's shop that I can use to re-hone
the cylinders, but I'll need to get some new rings.  This brings up
another question...  What're the best rings to use?  I've got Total
Seals in there right now, but I didn't have enough experience with the
previous rings (Deves?) to tell if the Total Seals were worth the extra
cash.  Any opinions?
