Don't forget that brake and hub mods are illegal for higher prep level
as well. SCCA street prepared (me) doesn't allow that either. If they
did, I'd be running SC struts and five spoke fuchs already.

Yup. And my preference is to keep the car completely legal. I'd rather
win and know that I won with a legal car. Even if it's a mod that
doesn't make much of a difference, I'd know and that'd be enough.

And wheels can be had cheaper than revolutions. UltraLight can get a
15x8 three peice alluminum wheel for about $260 each.
