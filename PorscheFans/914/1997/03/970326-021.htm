    I think it's just a warranty against manufacturing defects, not
    against normal wear and tear.

    Of course, Dave... 540 547-3288.

    Probably not, but they'll overhaul and re-valve your old shocks
    for a fee.  If they;re double-adjustable, teh re-valving fee is
    probably worthwhile; if not, it may not be cost-effective.
