agree w/ Phil that 914 has no appreciable vintage venue, altho scca
lists  70-71 in their historic rulebook, so it is eligible there, and
generally scca has a "25 yrs old or no longer competitive" slant on
vintage which is vastly more generous than most.  CSRG just raised their
elig to include 1967 cars, which is where most are at... here on the
left coast we have a lot of options for track time, and a 914 driver can
run in the pca, scca, NASA, & time trials, & autocross .. i find each
venue has an engaging social aspect & comraderie so a 914 driver can
stay busier than most of us can afford to... i figure it costs me about
$500 a track weekend no matter which venue it is.... & that's if i don't
break anything major... i tho't about the 912 option for awhile... but
instead am i building a vintage 62 mgb ... cuz it'll be more competitive
for the $$.. not a winner, but not at the back of the grid, which
translates to more fun "dicing" in mid pack & the fun of an open car...
and the whole car is cheaper than the engine in my 914-6
