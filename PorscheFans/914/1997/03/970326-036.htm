OK.  I like a good joke. Here is one for you.

                                                 3 Beers for the Irishman

                  An Irishman walks into a bar in Dublin, orders three pints
of Guinness and sits
                  in the back of the room, drinking a sip out of each one in
turn. When he
                  finishes them, he comes back to the bar and orders three
more. The
                  bartender asks him, "You know, a pint goes flat after I
draw it; it would taste
                  better if you bought one at a time." The Irishman replies,
"Well, you see, I
                  have two brothers. One is in America, the other in
Australia, and I'm here in
                  Dublin. When we all left home, we promised that we'd drink
this way to
                  remember the days when we drank together." The bartender
admits that this
                  is a nice custom, and leaves it there.

                  The Irishman becomes a regular in the bar, and always
drinks the same way:
                  He orders three pints and drinks them in turn. One day, he
comes in and
                  orders two pints. All the other regulars notice and fall
silent. When he comes
                  back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says,
"I don't want to
                  intrude on your grief, but I wanted to offer my
condolences on your great
                  loss." The Irishman looks confused for a moment, then a
light dawns in his eye
                  and he laughs. "Oh, no," he says, "everyone's fine. I've
just quit drinking."
