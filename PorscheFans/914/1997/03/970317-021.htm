Woah! Why so much toe in? With that much toe-in the car will be very
sluggish at autox speeds. I've never in my years of autoxing heard of
toe in as a desired setting. Toe _out_ in the front for turn-in, and
toe-in at the rear for high speed stability. And 1/4" is alot of toe in.
Yes, -1.5 degrees camber is a good number, but keep in mind that will
vary with tires. Especially competition tires, the BFG is very happy
with -1.5 on my car, while the Yokohama needed a good bit more. And this
will vary from driver to driver and car to car depending on other
factors such as spring and sway bar rates and driving styles.

> Rear:

A little more rear camber would probably be better, but this again
depends alot on car setup, tires, and driving style. And I would toe-in
the rear just a little to make it behave better at higher speeds. Toe
out in the rear at high speed makes for a very squirly car. 

I'll give you an idea of what I'm running and then take into account
diferent setups.

ME: 
Konis at all four corners
150# rear springs on adjustable perches
stock (but fresh) front torsion bars
19mm weltmeister adjustable front sway bar
BFG R1 race tires

Front:
I have the sway bar set approx 2/3 full stiff. I like a little more
compliance on bumpy terrain.
-1.5 degrees negative camber
6 degrees caster
1/16 toe out

Rear:
-1.25 degrees negative camber
3/16 toe in

Car has been corner balanced as well.

Now if your car still has stock springs and the stock rear sway bar, it
_will_ handle differently, and you may find more negative camber in the
rear will be better. I needed about 0.5 degrees more negative camber
when I was running the Yokohama tires, and I hadn't even had that dialed
in before I ditched 'em for R1s.

> Set all the Koni shocks to about 1/3 hard.

A good starting point. Even 1/2 will be good for starting out. But don't
stiffen 'em up too much, you'll find the car harder to deal with at full
stiff untill you get a feel for what the car wants to do. The stiffer
the suspension, the faster it'll respond to your inputs. And if it's too
stiff, the car may seem to over-react to your inputs. This applies to
all suspension components, not just shocks.

Abosolutely!! I couldn't agree more! This is really the best way to make
your car go faster. Ask questions. Ask for instruction. Ask to ride as a
passenger. The more you know, the better (and faster) you'll get.

Very true, I've see it happen too. It's not a pretty sight. If you
really want trick rotors, get some high quality slotted rotors. Trick
rotors don't do you any good if they shatter at the end of high speed
straight. Anyone see last weekends F1 race? Pow! And those are expensive
carbon fiber rotors. It happens even with the big boys. I'd say save the
money on trick rotors and get a good brake duct kit. The cooler the
rotors, the better they'll work and the longer they'll last.

And most importantly, DRIVE! DRIVE! DRIVE! And have FUN! :)
