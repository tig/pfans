J.J., You will run into the problem of removing the engine from underneath
the 914 by doing it in this manner.
The back of the 914 will have to be jacked to a dangerous height to allow
the engine to be pulled out. If you were to start and find that it will not
clear, you will have to jack higher, but only from each side. This will
create a tendency for the vehicle to shift and possibly slide off the
stands. Could hurt you and destroy your engine and tranny. The lawnmower
idea suggested has a flaw. You have to get the engine back up and bolt in.
From my point of view, which is solely my own, it won't work. I think that
the test of time will show that removing the engine with a floor jack and a
18" x 24" plywood sheet on the jack mast is the sanest method. Also remove
the rear valance before hand to ensure good clearance. Takes me about an
hour or so including removing all the necessary lines, etc. I normally leave
the heat exchangers and exhaust attached. A good habit is to have someone
assist you on lowering the engine looking into the engine compartment
verifying that you did get ALL attachments loose. Be careful.
Good luck.
