how many times I got out of the car to lower the idle after warmup. 

Weber adjustments are well documented, whereas just getting a schematic 
for the D Jet system is difficult, and it's impossible to get one for the 
ecu box. Further, 25years is a long time for phenolic circuit boards, 
which is what's inside the ecu box and the throttle switch. They will 
fail soon. 

I haven't come to my decision lightly. It was only after being frustrated 
with trying to repair the wiring harness that I started to think about 
switching. This was after being frustrated with trying to re-locate the 
fuel pump up front, which I never did find a suitable spot.
