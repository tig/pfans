OK, all here's what I found. Both heads were full of water. The valve
seats are fine, the heads are fine. When I cracked the heads loose a
large stream of water gushed onto the floor. The engine was stopped
where all the pistons were lined up with each other at mid stroke.
Apparently opposing pistons filled with water locking up the engine.
Perhaps the extra volume in the sump also served to put hydraulic
pressure on the back sides of the pistons further locking things up. 

After pulling the heads off the pistons moved in the cylinders fine. I
have pulled the pistons and liners off. The crank, rods and cam look
fine. None of the rods are bent so apparently the lockup kept the starter motor from doing any damage since the motor never turned over at all.

I'm going to take the heads, pistons and liners to a machine shop to check out and see if I need to replace the P&Ls.

Thought y'all would like to hear the latest on the wet 914. BTW Dirk
Wright mentioned "rain hats" for my carbs. What are they, how do they
work and where can I get some?

Thanks,
