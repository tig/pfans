There are repair pieces available from AA, but any 25 year old wiring 
that's been exposed to engine heat will have brittle insulation and 
corroded copper. The connectors (those tiny female spades and those 
special card edge) are not readily available, so you can't repair the 
harness yourself with a superior, modern wire. If you've ever cut the 
plastic tubing off the harness you'll know the meaning of grungy. I mean 
disgustingly gross ancient oil everywhere!

And how long are sources for rebuilt units going to be available? With 
the rest of the system deteriorating, I suspect many more people like me 
are going to switch to carbs.

I didn't get my point. I was saying that new replacement parts are 
expensive and/or unavailable, and that sources for rebuilds are not going 
to be around for much longer.

Virginia just won it's case against the EPA because EPA don't have the 
aurthority to impose california-style emission reg's on any states. I 
have been re-assured repeatedly by state officials that they are not 
changing the laws here. In fact, I got a page-and-a-half letter from my 
county supervisor expressing how livid he was with the EPA attempting to 
dictate emissions laws. We have no emission tests for cars over 20 years 
old, and for cars up to 25 years old, the emissions equipment has to be 
in place and "functioning." The only emissions equipment that I'm aware 
of in the 1974 914 are the pcv valve and the charcoal canister, which are 
easy to adapt to carburetors. I also have a letter from EPA stating that 
it is not thier intention to remove well maintained old cars from the 
road, just to remove the poorly maintained ones. California has a 
particularly nasty form of environmental zealots that are bent on killing 
off all cars. They think that riding bicycles is the answer, which is 
crazy unless you lice in a balmy climate where it never snows. Try riding 
a bike in -10 degree snow and ice!!
