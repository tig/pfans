Well, I'm at a point where I need to sell my longtime companion.  I have
owned this car for four years now, and my brother had it for another
five before that.  However, I have come to realize that I don't have the
time to work on the car -- or to even take it out for fun drives.
Working 60-70 hours a week just doesn't leave much time for a life.  And
I could use the money to replace my main car ...

Anyway, it's a '74 914 2.0L -- frame fully restored, nicely repainted
three years ago (and rust-free except for a couple of small bubbles on
the paint), and completely redone interior and trunks.  Includes almost
new Pirelli P500 195/60R15s on Cheviot 7x15s, or possibly ATS 6x15s.
The engine is essentially untouched, but I have a spare 2.0L engine,
plus pistons, cylinders, exhaust, stainless steel heater boxes etc --
ready for someone to spend the time on assembling and installing.  As it
is, the car is perfectly driveable and enjoyable ... just a bit on the
loud side (hence the exhaust). 

I'd like to get C$7500 (US$5500) for it, but I'm willing to talk.  The
car and I are located in Waterloo, Ontario, an hour west of Toronto.  A
Canadian buyer might be the easiest, but I'm also willing to help
someone export it to the U.S.

Lots more details (and photos) on my web page --
