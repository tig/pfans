>Also, 5% of 25ft-# is not much (1.25ft-#) to worry about, in my opinion. 
I used ot be concerned about torque wrench accuracy, but now I'm more 
Interested in consistancy.

Yes I understand that, and I only use a click type for certain functions, ie 225
Foot Pounds required for parts on the Ghia, nice because it is 18" long.  I also
have a beam type, for most every day uses, engine assemble, smaller nuts and
bolts.  I also have an inch pounder and a fraction of an inch pounder 1/8.  I
get all tested, the 1/8 is and was used for hard drive repairs BTW.  Yes
consistency is good, but I pointed it out for the novice who thinks that because
the wrench says it 23Flbs, there for it is.  And does not realize it could be
off by quite a good margin.  This is also why most Auto manufactures are
specifying degree of rotation for or instead of an actual torque setting now for
critical items like cyl. Head bolts.

Once you know how far off your beam is, you can have accuracy and constancy in
one unit, by adjusting for the percent it is in error.  Most I have seen are on
the low side of error, but just think of the consequence if it is on the high
side.  I need to know, most don't, or don't care, which ever, it is just a point
to be taken into consideration.
