Clemson:

If reliability is a primary concern, DO NOT buy a 914-4; they have
VW-level reliability, but use Porsche-priced parts.  A 914-6 can be
substantially more reliable, but you still need to remember that
even the NEWEST 914 is over twenty years old and will, naturally, 
require more maintenance and repair than a newer car.

With that said...

Of the 4-cylinder 914s, the almost-universal consensus is that the
1973 2-liter cars are the best; second-best is a later 2-liter or 
a '73 1.7-liter.

I'd stay away from the 1.8-liter cars; they're slow.  I'd also avoid
the '70-'72 cars; they have tail-shifter transmissions that are
difficult to shift precisely (not that the later side-shifters are
all that great, anyway).

The '75 and '76 cars have heavy, ugly bumpers, but some of them have
certain options that weren't available on the earlier cars.

How much do you want to spend?
