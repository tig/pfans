Just a guess. I thought that the cutouts might be harder to duplicate
precisely. I was also under the impression that alot of the finishing
work for the sixes was done at stutgart. Maybe it was just the
drivetrain.

That of course is an obvious start. I was thinking of body work. But
certainly there are interior parts that can be transplanted. But a tag
can be removed from a dead 6 and riveted in place.

Hmm, that's a good one. That one I didn't know.

Yup. Easy to transplant too.

The easiest to see. But a dash swap can do that too.

Uh huh. Again, transplantable.

Ah! Bingo. That's a tough one.

Still swapable. But tougher I guess because of teh transaxle
differences.

ditto.

Ooh, good one. But swapable.

Swapable, but probably hard to find. Senseless to fabricate.
 
Great list. Thanks, I was hoping someone would set me straight on that
account. I should have been more observant the last time I had my head
in the engine compartment of a 914-6GT.

I guess my intent was to try and spot an attempted forgery rather than
just a well done conversion.
