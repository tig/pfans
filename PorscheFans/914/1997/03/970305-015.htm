Imparts (800.325.9043) sells what they call it the "Suction Gun"for $12.   
It works great for filling trannies.

	Hmm...  There's a different version made by (I think) "Sta-Lub"
for their own gear oils.  I think I got it for about $10 at my FLAPS.
It is a regular pump with valves and everything.  The suction end screws
onto the top of the bottle with a tube dangling down inside.  You push
the pluger repeatedly, and it pumps the oil out the "output" tube, which
has a plastic thingie on the end that holds it in the filler hole.  You
don't need to keep re-filling it; just keep pumping.
	It doesn't fit the regular 1-qt bottles of oil (Red Line, etc.)
but you can just hold the pick-up tube in the bottle anyway.  I am told
that it fits the larger (gallon?) bottles of Swepco quite nicely.  We'll
see on that count...
