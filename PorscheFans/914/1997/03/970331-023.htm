Well, just to put my oar in the water....

A friend who is a VW bus enthusiast has rebuilt numerous busses and engines.
He currently has a '69 a '74 and an '89.  The early ones have one newer engine
in one and some newer suspension parts because the guy managed to get a 
torque wrench that was so off calibration that he first lost the suspension
part. then blew then engine before he took the wrench to get calibrated.  He
now calibrates his torque wrenches either regularly, or before critical work.
He also now buys only Craftsman, since he had the problem with non-Craftsman
tools and his Craftsman torque wrench happened to be right on calibration-wise
when tested.

So, this guy's wrench was consistent.  But, unfortunately, consistently *wrong*.
