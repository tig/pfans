 Ray, to check first /reverse grind at a standstill, first make sure your
car is idling NO HIGHER than 1100 rpm.(ideal is 950) then, with an
assistant, push the pedal to the floor and watch the throwout bearing
lever.  It should move back and almost hit the transmission case.  If it
doesm't adjust the pedal stop on the floorboard(of course make sure you
still have about a half of and inch free play in the pedal before it gets
harder to push (pulls on the cable)) If the grind goes away, you have
solved the problem.  If it does not you will have to remove the
transmission and check the clutch parts and/or the soundness of the
transmission bearings. ( if you solve the problem, with clutch adjustment,
and it returns in a short while, you then suspect the the clutch cable or
the clutch tube.)
