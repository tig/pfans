Clean the inside of the engine compartment.

JC Witless has neato aluminum-backed padding, $25 for enough
to do your car with some left over.  Not stock, but spiffy.

Replace the gasket (rubber strip) that goes around the motor.

Check for rust.......

Inspect/repair/replace trunk pivots and engine lid hinges.

Re-pack CV Joints.  ("book" says 30,000 miles)  Inspect/replace
CV boots.  (JC Witless has colored boots cheap.  Mine are blue)

Check shift linkage bushings.

Check transmission mounts.  (Everyone I know has a cracked one
because they're so expenxive....)  Motor mounts too.

Any more?  Heck, you _might_ get done before your motor's ready!
