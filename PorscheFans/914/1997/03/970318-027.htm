Thanks for the replies J.J., Josh2, and Andy.  Good information.

I think my current plan will be:

Check leakdown and compression when warm.  Keep driving it for now and keep
checking. As Andy said, with only 250 it's possible the rings haven't
seated.  If the situation seems to be improving by time I pull the engine
for the eventual rust treatment/repaint I'll leave it alone.  While out (I'
ll pull engine/tranny/exhaust as a unit) I'll start and run the engine and
do more break-in.  This is how I did my type 1 engine when built it, out of
car where can check things.

Probably be Easter weekend before I get time to work on it and do checks,
I'll post results.

If situation seems same or getting worse as J.J. described I'll pull at
least the heads and inspect things.  It is possible the cylinders were
washed down.  This engine has dual 44 webers and as previous emails said,
turned out to be timed way in advance, ran bad at idle so PO had been
pumping gas pedal at startup and when at stops to keep it running, then
reving it to get going and blasting around, not the best break-in
procedure.  (I taped over the open sections where the chokes had been
removed, retimed and then set idle speed up.  Idles fine now though still
has big bog off idle).

I don't know if the PO was using synthetic oil or not.  I changed oil and
filter when I got it. Used Castrol 10-30W,  I don't really like the idea of
synthetics in air-cooled though I know this is one of those perpetual
debates on the lists.

I'm almost hoping the situation doesn't improve so I'll have the excuse to
take heads off and inspect, find out what size P&C I actually have, cc
heads so can find out the compression ratio, etc.  I don't really trust the
(unknown) builder although it could be fine (it does rev up quickly and
without vibration so hopefully a good balance job, maybe counterweight
crank).

 J.J  when you switched to Total Seal and rehoned, did you have the
cylinders honed by someone or do it yourself with one of those 3 or 4 stone
honing tools I see in the FLAPS? Since so new I'd probably try the
honing/reringing unless way out of spec when/if I check.

I'll check the smell of the oil out of the bellhousing, it was thin as I
recall so think it is engine oil but will recheck.  Either way I'll have to
split engine/tranny to get whateven seal it is fixed.

I am switchng back to FI, Calif Smog II so I have to for visual. Ralph, who
I'm buying the FI system from and getting it installed said he knows a few
tricks that we can try to make it work with the larger cam (he has that
D-Jet tester and has been playing with the various components).  Worse case
is I'll have to split the case and change cams if still can't pass smog
with the FI.  Then comes the decision of going hydraulic lifters <grin>.

Thanks again,
Jeff
