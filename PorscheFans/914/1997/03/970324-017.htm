It all depends on what you're looking at. Rotory and two stroke motors
_easilly_ exceed the 100HP/L and normally aspirated engines can easilly
be built to exceed that limit. They just won't last very long. It's a
matter of longevity and cost, and most car manufacturers rightly belive
that a car will sell more successfully if the engine lasts more than
20-30k miles and costs less the national debt of most small countries to
build. Then again, if someone gave me the 3.0 V10 from Renault that put
out _over_ 200HP/L, I'd have to ask "where's the rest of the car?". And
then I'd kick myself and bolt that sucker into my 914 and vaporise my
tires in a heartbeat. The next F1 race is on the 13th, any bets on
Ferrari? Will Damon Hill qualify above the 107% rule?
