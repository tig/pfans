Dion, Don et al,

The 74+ 914 2.0 throttle bodies are missing the vacuum pip of which you
speak.  If you remove your throttle body (or use a mirror) you will see a
flat spot where the pip used to live. I dunno why, probably an emissions
thing.  If you really want to hook up the vacuum advance line, then you
need an early throttle body.

Unfortunately, I can't tell you if it will make more power, I don't have
anything to compare it to.

cheers, Brian
