	You knucklehead! For only $375 more, you could've bought the
	heated model made from cast di-uranium by Psylicon Technologies.
	Not only does it keep your drink warm (up to 650 degrees) but it
	also adds it's own spark to your engine (through a connector that
	fits in the cigarette lighter) which Psylicon says gives you
	an additional 35 HP at the rear wheels! How about that?? I bought
	5 of the little buggers, wired them in series, and now my 944 has
	275 HP. The best 12 grand I've ever spent! And now I can serve
	hot coffee to all the corner workers at the track to boot!
