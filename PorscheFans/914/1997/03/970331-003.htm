Yes, but remember, a feeler gauge is not a very accurate tool.  They will be off
by a  few thoundands, and when you start stacking them you multiply this
inaccuracy.  Same goes for setting end play and valve adjustments, you can use a
set of feeler gauges, or a dial indicator.  It is just that normally the
indicator will be more accurate.

Also while on the subject of accuracy, please, I stress to all, get your torque
wrench tested for accuracy. At least before your next big engine overhaul.
Local Snap-On or tool truck should be able to tell you where to have it done.  I
know Griots Garage does it for a fee, but it is a good idea, since they are know
to go south after a few uses.  I get mine done before a major rebuild, which
means about twice a year for me.  No I don't rebuild a 914 engine every 6
months, I do drive other things too.  But every time mine has been off enough
that I felt good about having it recalibrates.  This is true for any torque
wrench including the beam types.  The set and click types actually go out of
spec faster than a beam type.   But most are off, even the new ones setting on
the self.

One note even if you bought from Sears don't expect them to know where to get it
calibrated, they will not.  Flag down a tool truck, spend your lunch in the
midst of the tool gods.  And don't be surprised if your trusty torque wrench is
off by 10%, because it happens.  Another reason to prefer angle degree rotation,
for torque setting.  Which if I remember correctly RaceWare provides, but you
will not find a mention of these specs, in the Factory manual, or Hayes, Clymer,
and Chilton.
