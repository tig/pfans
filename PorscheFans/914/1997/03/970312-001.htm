My PO rigged a homemade oil cooler to the front bumper, and it makes an
enormous difference.  When I bought the car, the oil cooler was plumbed
into the system, and normal highway driving would have me up around 280
degrees in no time (That's assuming the red mark on the center-console
mounted oil temperature gauge is 290 degrees).    I plumbed the cooler
in, and my temperature dropped in half.  I haven't had a chance to
"officially" race it, but long hard runs up I-70 leave me with an
estimated temperature of 180 degrees.  I think the cooler was made out
of some old air-conditioning part (I know nothing about air conditioning
- it looks like a tiny radiator).  A plate of thick metal hangs from the
bumper down to within 2 inches of the ground.  A rectangular piece was
cut from this plate, and a thick screen installed.  The cooler attaches
to the back of the plate (so it sits under the bumper and is flush with
the front) and lets air flow through the screen and out the underside of
the car.  As Josh mentioned earlier, this has a dramatic effect on the
car as a daily driver.  The car has already been lowered a little over
an inch, so I have to be very careful entering/exiting driveways, etc.
I've scraped it many time, and on two occasions, I've bent the custom
bumper mounts terribly.  It's a bit of a pain, but with a smaller cooler
mounted a little higher, I figure you'd get close to the same efficiency
without the fear of tearing something off every time you drive over a
bump.

>One suggestion for oil starvation is an Accusump.  I've heard of them, but

I've got something similar to what Daniel mentioned (the Weltmeister
sump), but again, mine is homemade by the PO.  I don't think it holds
more than 1/3 quart, but I've never had an oil light turn on while
driving.  On the other hand, I've never had an opportunity to *really*
corner hard.  I too over-fill my oil, but only about 1/4in. on the
dipstick.

Hope some of this helps,
