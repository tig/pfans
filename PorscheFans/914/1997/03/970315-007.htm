The only place I can see would be through my K&N filters. Everything else
is tight.

I'm hoping it isn't quite as bad as you portray things. I don't think the
bottom end of the engine should be harmed as probably less than a quart
of water was in the sump. Since oil floats on water all the engine parts
in the case should have been above water. When I pulled the plug the water came out first since it was sitting on the bottom of the sump. I think the rust of the rings to the barrels will be my biggest concern. If so,
getting the dang barrels off will be a trick. Probably have to use
liberal doses of penetrating oil.

What really baffles me about this whole thing is that I was sitting on grid in Phoenix several years ago at a Pro when a huge gully washer came
through, totally flooding the track. At the time I didn't even have the
water tray in the car and I had no problems like this. Go figure!!
