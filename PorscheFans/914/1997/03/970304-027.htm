Hi Mike,

 Problem:  The car no longer has any "on-center" feel (ie. the steering 
 wheel doesn't have any inclination to stay centered)......  This makes 
 driving on the highway a 2-handed,  concentration intense 
 experience because the car wants to dart around  constantly.  Prior 
 to the affore-mentioned work, the car did not exhibit  this behavior 
 and would track nice and straight by itself.    "

Does the steering have the feel of being in a bind when it's at or near the
centered position?  If so, the problem is in the steering column.  When you
install rack spacers it raises the rack on the support necessitating the
"shortening" of the steering column.  Failure to do so puts the u-joints in a
bind, not allowing them to operate smoothly.  To do this, you need to loosen
the pinch bolts on each end of each u-joint and push the shafts as far as you
can into them without the shafts hitting the u-joint when it's rotated.  This
will take the bind out of the column allowing smooth rotation of the
assembly.
