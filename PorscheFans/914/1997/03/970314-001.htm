Hi All, 

 Last week we there talking about the Combo gauge for six conversions.
If you havent seen it already, you can read about it in the March Pano.
 The P-Fan (Stan Cooper) who made this gauge sold off all the remaining
kits to Palo Alto speedo. Palo Alto speedo has put the project on the
back burner for six months.
 Since there seems to be a want/need for this item, I have spoken to
Stan and he has given his permission for me to make them. It should take
a week or so for me to receive all the information to make the gauge.
Then track down the shops to produce the parts needed.
 Im still unsure how cost effective it will be to make such an item and
if its worth the time and money to start up a production run of gauges.
I cant even give you an idea of what a finish gauge would cost, just
yet.
 What I would like to know form you is, How many people would be
interested in such a gauge ??

 Thanks, 

  Don
