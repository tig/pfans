I agree with Rich Johnson. That a clear explanation, when what a person
purchases for their 914 is not what they paid for. $14,000 is a lot of money
for ANY 914 unless it is in AAA condition and a RARE model.

From my Automobile Atlanta catalog, page 4, quote, "Our Porsche car sales
department sells nothing but Southern rust free vintage Porsches ready to
drive to your home anywhere."  end of quote.

The "nothing but " meaning from my World Book Dictionary is "only". So a
person who purchases a 914, no matter what, should expect a rust free 914
from Automobile Atlanta even if it has rust in any form.

If this statement quoted is not true, it should be removed from the catalog. 

Most that have 914s are working people, not  wealthy, and should expect
honest service and business dealings from vendors they purchase from, no
matter what business.

Some of you will not like this post, but it is necessary to put this thread
to rest, not swept under the carpet and forgotten. Don't forget, we ALL ON
THIS LIST have different opinions which might not be the same as yours.
