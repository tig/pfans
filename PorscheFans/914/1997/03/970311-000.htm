Greetings 914-er's!

  I have a '74 914 2.0 litre... unfortunately, I also have collapsed
pistons.  My barrels are in good shape.
Does anyone have any pistons, or barrels and pistons for a 2.0 litre (94 mm
standard bore)?  Ideally, I would like
to find some used barrels that are too badly worn to be salvageable, but
that have pistons that are still
within the wear limits.   Failing that, I would like to find some barrels


and pistons that still have a reasonable
amount of life remaining.  Need to have all from same engine, or else
matched in weight.
  The pistons need to mike within .006" of new spec at the top and the ring
land area.  This would be
3.694"  (93.83 mm).  Mine are OK at the bottom up to the wrist pin area,
but shrink badly after that. (.025")
  If yours are no better than mine, I can't use them; otherwise please let
me know price and availability.

						Thanks,
						Jim T.
