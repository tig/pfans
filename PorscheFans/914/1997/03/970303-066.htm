Hi Mike!

  Sorry to hear you're having problems.  I am forwarding a copy of this 
reply to the PorscheFans list,  so you may (probably will) get two 
copies.

  Re:  Front Suspension, you wrote:

"   HELP!  I just replaced the front suspension bushings, ball joints, 
A-arms, steering rack spacers (my car is about 1 inch lower than 
stock), and installed turbo tie-rods on my 74 2.0.  I have 4 brand-new 
Yokohama A509's (195/60/15 on Fuchs), and my KYB shocks are 
only 1 year old.  I just had the car alligned at NTW and everything is 
well within their specs for the car.

Problem:  The car no longer has any "on-center" feel (ie. the steering 
wheel doesn't have any inclination to stay centered)......  This makes 
driving on the highway a 2-handed,  concentration intense 
experience because the car wants to dart around  constantly.  Prior 
to the affore-mentioned work, the car did not exhibit  this behavior 
and would track nice and straight by itself.    "

  This problem is usually attributable to castor angle.  The  
self-centering action derives from this adjustment, in exactly the way 
that a castor on a grocery cart stays aligned with the direction of 
motion of the cart (if the cart is in good shape).  This is why it's called 
castor angle.  
  I have had so many problems with alignment shops that I couldn't 
even begin to list them.  Sears has an incorrect value for the toe-in 
for my truck in their computerized data base, refuses to acknowledge 
it, and won't warranty their tires when they wear out in 1/4 mileage 
because of this problem.  Another shop did no better, and further, 
had my steering wheel cocked at a 30 degree angle going straight 
down the road.  Another insisted that the alignment was correct, 
despite a pronounced tendency to pull to one side. Etc.,etc.,etc.
  If you don't like the feel of the car, take it to a different shop.  I use 
one that does nothing but alignment and frame repair.  If you can find 
a similar specialist in your area, check him out.  Tell him the tale, and 
see if he has any suggestions.  He may just be able to adjust it 
properly the first time around.

  I don't know who "NTW" is, but if they are a Porsche dealer, they 
are probably NOT a good bet for alignment.  Dealers rarely do 
enough alignments to allow them to specialize in the procedure.  You 
will likely get someone who has a smog license, rebuilds gearboxes, 
and does an occasional alignment when the request comes in... not 
often enough to get consistently good at it.   Also, dealerships work 
by the "flat-rate" book, which usually means that their people have to 
hurry through each job.  The last thing that you want is someone who 
can't really take the time to make careful, detailed measurements on 
your Porsche.

  I hope that you can find a shop to help you out on this one.  If not, 
you might try measuring the castor angle yourself, and see if it's really 
"in spec"  as NTW says, or not.  To do this, check out:
    
	http://www.vtr.org/maintain/diy-alignment.html

  Here you will find instructions on how to do the whole job yourself, 
including castor.  Please let me know how it turns out.

				Good Luck,
				Jim T.
