I gave Mark Stephens High Performance a call today to find out about
getting my heads worked on.  I've got new sodium-filled valves and new
valve guides, but a dropped valve seat.  My exhaust studs have also
stripped so many times that they're all double-inserted.  So I asked how
much it would cost to get new valve guides, and he said that they'll do
a full inspection of the heads, put in new valve guides, and new valve
seats for $125/head.  That sounded pretty good to me, but he then went
on to explain a little known problem that I thought I'd double check
with the list.  He said that the sodium filled valves were never an
"improvement", but rather a "fix" for the inferior stock valve seats.
He explained that the new valve seats are so much harder than the stock
ones that it causes problems with the expansion rates of the sodium
filled valves.  He suggested that I get new stainless steel valves put
in with the new valve seats.  This increased the price to $169/head.
Not too bad if you think about it (~$10/valve), but still $90 more in
the end.  Has anyone else heard of this?  I think I'll probably follow
his suggestion, so is there anyone out there that wants to buy a
complete set of sodium filled valves with 3000 miles on them?  As far as
the exhaust studs go, I thought I'd get the inserts pulled, the holes
re-welded, and the studs re-tapped.  He said that they have to grind
something down to do it, which complicates the job to the tune of
$25/hole ($200 total!).  He suggested that I pull my own studs, and
they'll re-do my inserts with new hardened steel "step" studs (10mm in
the head, 8mm at the bottom) for $5.50/hole.  This sounds reasonable.
Does anyone know of any problems with this technique?

Any comments would be greatly appreciated!



Thanks,
