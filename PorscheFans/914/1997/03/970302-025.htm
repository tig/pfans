To all of the members of our porschefans list.
Subject: Repeating messages.

There is a learning curve needed by those of us who use the list for mail.
Anyone who does the Cc should be aware that by using these methods as shown
are surely causing repeating messages when responding to an AOL message or
maybe ALL site messages.Make certain that when you post to just Cc to one
area alone. NEVER AS SHOWN BELOW.

        PorscheFans-928@porschefans.com, Racing@porschefans.com

Earlier in February we all received repeating mail. I sent the WEBMASTER of
the source of those earlier messages a message asking their assistance to
stop the annoying repeat mail. For your information, it is after I sent the
webmaster, a plea for assistance, that the mail was STOPPED. Almost immediately.
Also for your information, I am not seeking credit. Just helping to stop the
PROBLEM. Sometimes, we have to step foward when all others fail in their
expertise.
 
The earlier messages were sent by someone who did not know how to
unsubscribe from the list.
If your messages repeat, then unsubscribe and then re subscribe to the list.
I am referring to the John Doe(NewName@otsega.net Messages that repeated
more than 150 times. 

Webmaster @otsega.net, Mike O'Dea responded to my webmaster assistance
message with:

Can you send the user in question EXPLICIT un subscribe directions, its
appears he has got himself stuck in the mail loop?

thanks
