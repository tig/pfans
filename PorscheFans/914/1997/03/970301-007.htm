In a message dated 97-02-26 13:18:49 EST, you write:

<< One major consideration is where are you going to run the car.  By this I
mean 
 what region or organization will you run with.  You may want to take a look
at 
 how many other 914s and 944s run in your venues.  Generally, you want to
have 
 similar cars to run with as it's just more fun.  For example, comparing GGR
in 
 No. Cal. with POC, GGR has a large contingent of 914s with 4 cyls. and POC
in 
 So.Cal. has relatively few.   
  
 I run a 944 and a 912 with GGR.  It has a growing number of 944 cars coming 
 out and I would bet a stable or declining number of 914s. The 914s are now
20+ 
 years old.  Not only is  there a camaraderie issue but parts, advice, help 
 with tools, ect. will be important to you as you start to go to events.
 BTW, 
 the last of the 356's are 32 years old.  We don't see any at time trials any

 more and I've only seen a couple at club races......Very few 914-4 cyl. cars

 have been showing up for W.coast club races.....It can get lonely out there
if 
 you're the only 924Turbo on the block.  Any reports on hot bastions of 914
or 
 356 TT and Club race activity? 
  
 Ted  >>

Ted's right about his assessment on car entry numbers - at last week's POC TT
and Cup Race at Buttonwillow, there was one 356, 5 or 6 early 911/912, and a
handful of 914s (not counting high-end 6 cyl cars). I only saw 2 of the 914s
in the cup race. Also, all of early 911/912s but one and the 356 were only
there to get time in on a new track for an upcoming VARA event and we all
left before timed runs.

Here's my usual pitch for Vintage Racing. The person that started this thread
could build a "starter" 912 for no more than the 914 he mentioned... and then
have about 100 vintage events to chose from around the country and still
enter PCA/POC/etc events whenever he desired.  The same isn't true for the
914 because most vintage organizations won't let it run.
