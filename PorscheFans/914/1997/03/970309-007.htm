Jim,

I de-rusted my 914 a couple of years back.

I tried components from the following places:

Automotion, Automobile Atlanta, Parts Werks, Tweeks, and Performance Products.

The highest quality parts were from Automobile Atlanta.  Period.

George takes a lot of bashing on this list, but darn it, his
"rustoration" parts fit, are well made, and look right.

They were also the only parts that were galvanized.

He can (will?) also provide you with assistance on how the car SHOULD
look when it's done.

Gary.
And no, I've never gotten a discount from these plugs.
