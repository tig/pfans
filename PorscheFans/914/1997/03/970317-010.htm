Mike, I have a pair of manifolds that fit my 2.0 914 (3 stud) and also my 
1.7 type 4 bus engine (4 stud).  You will find that the outter 2 holes will 
have to be drilled slightly closer in.  These 2 holes will not be mutually 
exclusive (ie. they'll overlap), but I haven't had any trouble with them on 
either engine.  If you want to see if you can do this, get a pair of gaskets 
for the 1.7/1.8 heads and compare them to the bottom of the manifolds.  I 
did find, however, that you can not use 1.7/1.8 gaskets on the 2.0 heads 
because they are not quite wide enough to encompass the wider set of outter 
holes.  If any of this is confusing, just get a pair of gaskets from each 
and you'll see what I mean.

Happy motoring.
Mike g.
