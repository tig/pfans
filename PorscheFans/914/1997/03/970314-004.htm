Thanks for the kind words Al.  Hearing from people like you makes
everything we do here worth the time we spend, and encourages us to try
even harder.  By the way, the story on Perry Kehil's 914 is interesting.
Perry is truly a nice, nice guy. The 914 deal was extremely aimacable, he
chose among several 914s and we took Perry and his wife out to dinner. It
was only SEVERAL YEARS LATER when he suddenly developed a case of buyer's
remorse when he removed both engine and interior insulator pads and saw
some firewall rust-through.
  Now, if anyone has followed our ads or looked through our catalog, (page
36) you will all remember the ad "Should This Car Be Saved"  It featured a
1973 914 that belonged to Sean until he pulled out in front of someone and
smashed the living hell out of the car.  It was truly a total.  But we
wanted to make a point about the greatness of 914s so we repaired the
collision damage, added steel flares and made the car our Road Atlanta
track car.  The ad was monsterously successful.  We did not restore the
car, nor take it apart and look into its dark recesses. The car looked good
when we finished, but come on everyone, is anyone going to totally restore
a track car? We ended up with over $20,000 in this car because, of
course,it was so badly wrecked and we new going into the project that it
was monitarily  not worth repairing.
  This radically repaired 914 is the car Perry purchased and is complaining
about!  He had the opportunity to purchase several other more pristine 914s
but I think the fact that the car had steel flares and he saw the pictures
of both the  bad wreck and the car bering repaired some how turned him on.
Now he is vice president of the Renegade Club (doing an excellent job of
promoting the 914) and frequent poster as "the 914 guy" or something.
   I say, Perry get over it!  We all share mutual love for the 914 and I am
sure we  have better things to do than spat.  It makes everyone, including
myself, look like what we call a "weenie" and none of us should stoop that
low. Perry I am sorry you had a problem with your purchase, but get over
it, get on with your life, and get back to helping the Renegade Club
promote the 914!
