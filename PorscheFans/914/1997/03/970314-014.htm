Steve Compton (with copies to other 914 people and friends),

You were here at the Hampton Tour when we had the 4" of rain. My 914 was
sitting out in it. Later, when it wouldn't turn over I assumed that it
had dropped another valve seat. That still may be the case but I have
started pulling the motor. When I pulled off the exhaust pipes water
came out of them. When I drained the oil, about a quart of water came
out first. Hmmm, I'm now sure that water got inside the motor during
that big downpour. My 914 has the water tray on the lid but with no down
pipes. Could the 4" of rain overcome the tray so that water was gushing
all over the engine? Also I have dual carbs with K&N filters. How do you
suppose the water got inside the engine? Through the carbs? Somewhere
else? I'm quite baffled.

Also, I tried to pull the spark plugs and then turn the motor over but it
won't budge. Any ideas? I'll have the engine out tomorrow and at least
pull the heads off. I'll keep you posted about what I find.

How's the karting experience working out for you? Are you getting the
bugs worked out?

Talk to you later,

Ben Thatcher
