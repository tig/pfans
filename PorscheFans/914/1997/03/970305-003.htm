assembled very wrong?  Any comments / suggestions would be appreciated.

	I have two.  First: The preload spring  is very necessary.   I had
one broken  in my 75 1.8 and either didn't know or didn't care about
it.  I went   through 2  cables in  a very short period of time including
one  of those super  Terry  ones.    Turns out both  broke  at  the
same place, right  there at the  nylon  pully.   THe cable  would  rub
on the pulley  guard with no preload and eventually cut through.  I
filed and polished  the unfinished stamped edges  of the guard, put
on  a new   pedal  spring and cheap  replacement cable.  All  has  been
well  for  40-60k mi now.

	POint 2:
	I  can't adjust the  freeplay worth  crap  either.    I think this
had caused the spring failure also.  The clutch I  had removed  from
the car when  I  got it was still  good wear-wise, but  was soaked
with oil from a  transaxle   input  shaft  seal leak.  Took  care
of  leak,  put in new (or  rebuilt ) clutch.    I  remember  the
one I took out had no gap  between  the friction surfaces, and  that
the replacement had the front  &  back seperated  by the springy gap.
I  reasoned that the spring/gap was  there to make the  take-up  more
gentle   to prevent  clutch chatter  or whatever.  The problem  is
that this makes the  necessary gap between the  pressure plate an
flywheel  much  larger  than  before with  the clutch  disengaged (
pedal  in).  I  found it impossie to use  my  unsynchonized gears
(reverse, 1st, second half the time).  The shift fork WAS hitting the
transmission case.  FOlks, dont do this at home.  This leads to tunnel
cable guide failure. (BTDTGTTS).  Replaced the little plastic cup
on the shift fork and stacked some washers under the threaded end
of the pivot ball to make it longer so it would release all of the
gears.  THe problem is that there is so  much pedal travel necessary
from clutch full off to clutch full on well there isn't enough.  I even
removed the stops at the pedal cluster.  I had hoped to burn this clutch
out so I could put a more correct one in, so I treat it like crap, but
it won't give up (this is almost 80 kmi).  Any other thoughts?
Anybody notice the differences in uninstalled clutch thicknesses?
I hate having to have some pressure on the throwout bearing all the
time (this is more than the preload spring), this is the pedal upper
stop.  I hate having no buffer except hitting the floor with pedal
to ensure the release.  Most cars 1/4, 1/2 way down the clutch is
released and the rest of the way is wasted motion.  
Thanks
