Hi gang,

With the recent thread on valve adjustments, let me add my $.02

Whenever I do a valve adjustment, I push the car onto the hoist at work, in
the late afternoon, after the beast has cooled off.  I slot the car in 5th,
and lift it into the air.
(this is when I usually drain the oil, and check trans level, adj the
clutch & rear brakes, etc)

I then turn the engine until I see the TDC mark on the flywheel through the
notch in the trans bell housing.  This puts it at BDC.   If you block one
wheel (with a 2x4 or similar) you can turn the other wheel, which will turn
the engine over.

I pop off the valve covers, and check the rockers.  There are 4 valves that
can be adjusted at this time.  There are 3 on one side, and one on the
other side that have a small amount of play.  This play is the valve
clearance.

Make sure you use the right gauge for the valves.   2L 914 engines use 008
exh and 006 intake.   I just remember that the middle 2 are 006 and the
outer 2 are 008.

After adjusting these 4 valves to your satisfaction, turn the engine one
complete revolution, until the TDC flywheel mark lines up again.   Then
adjust the other 4 valves.  That's it.  (If you're doing an oil change,
don't forget to fill 'er up)

The hardest part is getting a screwdriver in position to turn the adjusting
lugs on some of those rockers.

Have fun, and don't get oil in your hair.
