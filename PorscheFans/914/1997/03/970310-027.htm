Please remember:  For the 2.0 cars, only 1973 and early (built before
january) 1974 models had a vacuum advance port on the throttle body. Late
74, and 75/76  models had no port, but only a flat rounded place on the
throttle body.  California emmissions 75 and 76 2.0 models had a throttle
body port reinstalled where the vacuum advance port USED to be on the
earlier cars, to connect the egr valve.
  Now for all of you with a non vacuum advance throttle body 914 2.0 (or
even a 1.8) cut a 3 inch piece of hose,(3.5 mm id, black, braided) and
connect it to the vacuum advance and let it breathe into the wind.  This is
what the factory did as the cars came down the assembly line!
