Hi J.J.!

  In reply to your plans:

  
> I hadn't planned on pulling the pistons, just the heads.

  Please, DON'T do any work that you had not planed on doing... I was under
the impression that you were going to
pull the jugs off the engine anyway.  If that's not in your plans, then
PLEASE don't make any extra work or expense for
yourself on my account.

  That said, let me point out a couple of things.  When I pulled my heads,
3 of the 4 jugs stayed with the case (I think)
but the 4th one stuck to the head, and it stayed stuck all the way off and
onto the bench.  If you are sure that you
have had NO movement of the cylinders with respect to the case when you
pulled the heads, then you will be
fine, but if not, then you should think about sliding the cylinders off far
enough to clean and re-glue the cylinder-
to-case joint with Permatex.  If the cylinders moved at all during
dissassembly, you will have oil leaks around the
cylinder bases if you don't re-glue.

  Second,  it is recommended that you cc your heads; that is, measure the
combustion chamber volume (which
will change with head work), and measure the other volume (space between
piston and top edge of cylinder
seating surface) and calculate the compression ratio for each cylinder.  If
any of them exceed 8 to 1 (Euro pistons)
then you will need to put shims under the cylinders (between the cylinders
and the engine case) to reduce the 
compression ratio to safe values.  If this becomes necessary, then you will
have to pull the cylinders off to get
the shims on; no other way to do it.
  If you want more details on how to do this, I have been studying up on
it, and although I have not yet done
it, I plan to do so when I put my engine back together... I think that I
can tell you how to go about it.  The shims
are available from Mark Stephens.

  Lastly, to get the minimum data that I need, it is not necessary to pull
off your barrels.  The data that I was 
requesting was for compilation into a posting to the list and the various
web pages which would be titled:
"Principal Inspection Specifications for 914 Pistons" or something like
that.
  However, for a quick check, it is not necessary.  If you would be so kind
as to slip a feeler gauge down
inside your cylinder and measure the clearance between the piston and the
bore at the top of the piston, that will tell
me what I really need to know.  In my case, the gap is .025" to .030".  
This is big enough that the top
piston ring is easily visible between the piston and the bore... the gap on
my engine appears positively huge to even the
casual observer.  If you would try an .008" feeler gauge between the piston
and the bore, this would tell me
a lot.  .008" is the wear limit specified in both books that I have,
although this is to be measured at a different point.
However, if you have trouble getting an .008" feeler gauge down the gap
between the piston and the bore, then
I will in effect have my answer.  If an .008 goes in loose, then I would
not try anything thicker than .015" or
so because it will be too stiff to curve itself to fit the bore curvature,
and you may scratch the bore.  Anything
up to .015" or so would tell me a great deal.  The smaller your clearance
is, the more likely it is that collapsed
pistons are actually my problem.  If it is smaller than .008", then I would
appreciate knowing how much smaller.
Also, if you could try it at various places around the circumference of the
bore (say at 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock,
6 o'clock, and 9 o'clock) that will help take out any variations due to
loading wear.  In addition, it will be easier if 
you turn the engine over so the piston is near the top of the cylinder, but
not at TDC  (DON'T turn the engine 
unless  you have cylinder retainers installed (see page 35 in the Haynes
book, fig. 21.7a) or you will definitely
have broken glue joints to fix).  Just below TDC will allow you to get an
accurate clearance measurement
without worrying about the carbon ring that forms at the very top of the
cylinder.

  That's a tough call... If the rings are turned so that the gaps are in
exactly the same positions that they were
when they came out of the bore, then theoretically, you should be all
right.  The problem will be to get the
cylinders off and back on again without disturbing the ring orientation.  
The catch is that after running in the 
cylinder is no  longer perfectly round, and neither are the rings, but they
match.  Turn the rings, and they may
have to wear a great deal in order to assume a new shape.  This would make
for a long seating time (if ever) 
and poor life expectancy after that.  The rule of thumb is if you have to
pull the cylinders, you hone and put in
new rings. 
   If you are careful to rotate each piston to TDC before you move the
cylinder, you should be able to move it far 
enough out to clean up the cylinder and case and apply new glue, should
that prove necessary, without disturbing
the ring orientation.  If you have to add shims to reduce compression,
better figure on new rings.

  Boy, do I know how that is!  My wife has had to take a job to support my
Porsche (she calls it my other girlfriend)
and I'm still looking at a mountain of credit card debt!  (And that was
before I started looking at new barrels!)

  Anyway,  I think that about covers it.  I really appreciate your
willingness to help me on my quest for data.
I hope that your project goes well, and that you don't need to pull your
cylinders off the case.  That would work
out best for getting your car on the road with a minimum of expense, and on
the road is where all 914's should be!

							Thanks Again,
