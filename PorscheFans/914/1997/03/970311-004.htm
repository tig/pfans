I'm taking the liberty here of posting part of an exchange with AEK:

Hi Andrew:

port (see>below).

I have been running with the vac gauge hooked to the retard port for 
about two weeks.  It works like a switch:  throttle closed = full vac., 

regardless of rpm.  Throttle opened just a little = no vac.

Sorry, snipped too much here..

How did you determine this?  Did you drive the car with a vac gauge?
I used one gauge at different times, but noted the conditions, and 
found that the two are never operating simulataneously.  The retard 
port may be drilled at an angle to cancel venturi effects. 
Here's my estimate:

1) at idle:            retard=max, advance=0  = retarded
2) hi rpm/light load:  retard=0, max advance  = max advance
3) hi rpm/cruise load: retard=0, part advance = part advance
4) at WOT:               retard=0, advance=0  = no advance/retard     

The amount of vacuum advance is a function of both rpm and load.  
It could be plotted on a graph.                       

>Historically (as you pointed out), I think this makes sense, too:  
>First>there was only mechanical advance (for obvious reasons),

The first advance was a control on the dash or steering stalk.  
Next came centrifugal advance.

You should be able to measure the degree (pun) of movement with a 
protractor, and note the amount of vacuum required to hit the stop.

>Thanks for your input.
Likewise.

I have since that time obtained a dist. machine and have measured 
degrees of advance, but don't remember exact numbers.  Could do it
if somebody has a burning need to know.
