  As long as we're on the subject of fun to watch powered sports, I
remember seeing something on TV once about a sport that is/was popular in
South America.  It is called "Automobile Soccer".
  
   The game is played in a fairly small walled-in arena (often a bull ring)
and the object is to push a ball about 8 feet in diameter into the opposing
team's goal.  With a car.  The car of choice is, believe it or not, a
Renault Dauphine.  The reason is that they are rear engined, which
minimizes the likelihood of complete incapacitation of the car from
frequent and recurring front end collisions.  What collisions, I hear you
ask?  Well, remember that the object is to push the ball through the
opposing team's goal.  This means that the usual situation is that two cars
from opposing teams are both heading for the ball, and can't of course see
each other, because the ball is so large.  They usually meet head-on, which
causes the ball to pop out, and then someone else steers for it, and away
they go.  Dauphines are of course ideal; they keep running after hours of
this treatment, they don't cost very much, and if you total one, who cares?
 The reason for the small arena is to limit the top speed; Dauphines don't
accelerate very well, especially veterans of this sport!
  I remember one instance where a car was "T-boned" by a car on the
opposing team.  The drivers door went flying off.  The driver jumped out,
risking life and limb in the confusion, grabbed his door, threw it into the
back seat, and headed for the pit area.  A few whacks from a giant hammer
and the door was forced back into it's frame, the driver hopped in via the
passenger's door, and was back in the game!  Great sport!
