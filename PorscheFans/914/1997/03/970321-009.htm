	Seat time.  More driving.  More driving.  Driving with an
instructor.  Driving without an instructor.  Read Hank Watts'
_Secrets_of_Solo_Racing_.  More driving.  Still more driving.  And
then, just to be different, some DRIVING.
	The driver is an awful lot of how a car does on the autoX
course.  I know someone (not me, sigh!) with a 2.0 914 bone-stock
(except an added roll-bar) with STREET (read: hard) tires that can
routinely spank a number of the 911s that come out to autoX--and
that includes some well-prepared and reasonably-powered machines!
	Next in the bang-for-the-buck category are tires.  Get
either the BFG Comp T/A R1s or the Yoko A008 RS2s in 205/50-15 all
around.  Think bushings, sway bars, exhaust, et al. after that.
	The getting the body fixed is a tough call.  If it gets bad
enough (i.e., it breaks) it could be very very bad, even dangerous.
It could also be flexing enough that a stiffer suspension doesn't
do anything.  Then it might be worth just from a performance stand-
point.  However, it may be difficult to tell if it's having any
effect until you've got more driving experience.

	Good luck, go fast, apex late--and HAVE FUN!
