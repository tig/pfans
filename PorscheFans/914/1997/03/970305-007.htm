Dirk and Andrew raised serious questions. I had called Redline for their
recommendation several weeks ago and MTL was their call.

I just called them back and spoke to "the chemist" (don't remember his
name), and he did some research and said that they recommend the 75w90NS
for the 914. Since they had incorrectly told me MTL over the phone, they
are shipping me 3 quarts of the 75w90NS to replace what I bought. BTW, he
was mostly concerned about the weight as the MTL is GL4 rated.

I hope you guys aren't going to tell me to drain that too!!! :)

I'm sure glad the list is here to keep me on the straight and narrow.
