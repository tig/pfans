I contacted George immediately, he told me he would repair the rust "at
cost"
which he said was $450 and to make an appointment with Matt, which I
did.
 Two days before the scheduled trip for the repairs, I called to confirm
and
was told my appointment was cancelled.  I rescheduled, this appointment
was
also cancelled, and I was told that they were "really busy" and weren't
sure
when they would be able to fix my car.  I expressed my concerns about
customer service to a $14,000 car sales customer.  The upshot of this
situation was a engine shelf and inner fender sent to me free of
charge.  At
this point I felt that something was better than nothing, and I was only
going to get continually put off for the repairs.  Do you think it's
unreasonable for a customer of some 10 years and total purchases of
close to
$20,000 to expect not to be put off for repairs?  It was also at this
time
period, during a telephone conversation with Sean, that I was told this
car
was originally a 1.7!  By now I knew I had been taken to the cleaners,
and
figured whatever I got without paying any more would be better than
nothing. 
 
I had really wanted to convert the car to a six, and some two years
later I
was finally in a position to do so.  I had not done the rust repairs,
but
still had the repair pieces.  After removal of the engine, interior, and
firewall insulation I really got a suprise.  The firewall was just as
perforated with rust as the inner fender.  This really angered me, as I
could
tell the firewall insulation in the cabin had been removed and the rust
ignored.  Another call to George, whose attitude was not positive and
definately irritated at me for calling about this.  The upshot of this
call
was to sell me a firewall at "cost".  I decided to video chronicle the
problems with the car and send it to George, no reply was ever received
by me
from Automobile Atlanta in response to the video I sent. NOTHING!!!  The
bottom line is that your catalog states "we sell only rust free cars",
but in
private after the sale has been made you say "these cars are 20 years
old and
all 914's have rust", it's either one way or the other, but it seems as
though the policy is to play both ends to the middle.

Other "oddities" and misrepresentations
In upgrading the suspension I found that the "M" calipers on the front
of the
car never had the spacer removed (for non vented rotors) and the piston
was
almost out of the caliper bore.

The car did not have turbo tie rod ends as was stated on the spec sheet.

The rear hubs which had been converted to 5 lug pattern were not
consistant
side to side.  The studs on one side were welded to the hub, but not the
other.  The studs weren't positioned as to enable the use of the rotor
attatchment screws to the hub.  

The rear trunk has always leaked, even though the tail light housings
have
new gaskets, and don't leak there.

The wheels on the car were not Fuchs, but rather cheap repros.

The dash face was replaced, but the installer didn't bother to clean off
the
old adhesive and three months after I got the car home the dash face
started
peeling off.
