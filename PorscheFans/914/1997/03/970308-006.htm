 Hello Dion, 

 Well , this wont help any but, I had the very same problem with my '74
2.0L. Didnt know there was a problem until I went to smog it. Needless
to say , it didnt pass. Took it to my mechanic buddy for the tune up
that I should have done before the test. My mechanic swore up and down
that hose didnt go anywhere, He said there wasnt such hose, that one of
the stubs coming off the distributor was a breather, not satified with
his answer I went to the local dealer and he pulled out the book and
found the diagram, but still couldnt find where it went ? even the
dealer didnt know, guess he wasnt around there in '74.
 Since no body knew the answer and I had a smog test to pass (free
retest within so many days) I stuck a hose on the distributor and ran it
under the sheet metal and zip tied it off so it wouldnt come off. Ran
down to said smog place and ran the test, and I passed but the smog guy
wasnt done just yet, he walked over to his tool box and pulled out the 
vacuum tester ( I thought OH *$^&#@, Im in trouble now!) Well good luck
must have been smiling on me because he pulled the other line off the
distributor and checked vacuum there and it was fine (he remembered from
the first time,that one hose was missing) He Passed me ! what a long
test that was. Never did find out where that hose went ? Would still
like to know too.

 Thanks for listening, 
  Don
