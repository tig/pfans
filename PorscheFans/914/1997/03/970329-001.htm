For J.J. Slowik and other interested parties:

   I intend to use a dial caliper for this measurement.  A dial caliper
should probably be the first precision measuring tool that you  buy,
because of it's versatility.  A reasonably good one is as accurate as most
common micrometers, and is much more versatile. Mine will make  inside and
outside measurements to 6" at an accuracy of .001".  It will also measure
depth to the same extent and accuracy, which is what you will need to
measure your deck height.

  Making the measurement is merely a matter of setting the appropriate
piston to TDC with a cylinder retainer or two in place to make sure the jug
is fully seated, and then just measuring the depth from the top of the
cylinder locating flange to the top of the piston (the edge is not dished),
using the depth probe that is part of the movable jaw of the caliper.  The
distance from the tip of this probe to the square portion of the end of the
caliper frame is an identical distance to that between the jaws, and can be
read on the same scale and dial.  Be sure that your caliper long axis is
parallel to the long axis of the cylinder.  A little practice rocking the
end of the caliper frame on the cylinder ledge will enable you to feel when
the square end of the frame is flat on the top of the ridge, which is close
enough to parallel.  Then mike your OLD head gaskets, to get an idea of how
much they will contribute, and add this measurement to your depth
measurement.  (My Mitutoyo caliper says mine are .028" thick.)

  Don't forget to measure the volume of the dished area in the center of
the piston, using the calibrated water volume trick, and add this to the
volume you will calculate from the above measurements.  Add to this total
the volume given you by Mark Stephens, and divide it into the swept volume,
and that will give you the actual compression ratio.

  I find this real hard to swallow...  I suppose that there might be some
combination of factors that would add up to create higher temperatures in
the combustion chamber at somewhat lower compression, which might result in
pre-ignition and detonation, but as a general rule, the lower the
compression ratio, the cheaper gas you can burn, i.e. the more resistant
you are to detonation.  As I am taking a shortcut and not rebuilding my
bottom end at this time, I am going to reduce those Euro pistons down to
stock 7.6 to 1, or even slightly lower, to reduce overall power output and
bottom-end stress, as well as to reduce the possibility of detonation.  I
will let you know how it turns out, but I am not anticipating any problems
on that score.  I am posting this to the list also;  perhaps someone with
more experience in this area would care to comment.

  OK, you got my $.02 worth.
