Hi Andrew:
Many thanks for your .02 which is worth a LOT more to me to have the
info.  Ain't this list great!  Can you point me to information on the
"failure-detect" aspect of the master cylinder, that reinforces a
suggestion I heard, if that part of the mc is bad, chuck the unit and
get a new one.  But I'm curious to know more about the internal
workings of the 914/911 mc.

Thank you and everyone who's picked up this thread.  

Here's the current status.  Since I've got the rebuild kit, and what
seems to be a rebuildable mc, I'm going to clean, refurbish and
reinstall and will report the consequences.  Hopefully, a great, safe
result.  If careful testing (in my own driveway) shows up problems,
its time for a new unit.  I've rebuilt calipers and master cylinders
on other restorations that had sat a long time and they've been very
OK, even after a bunch of track time.  Its just been a while and I
now have the benefit of the list so I though I'd get some input.  I
do appreciate the shared wisdom.

aren't impressed, but isn't Spring fun!
