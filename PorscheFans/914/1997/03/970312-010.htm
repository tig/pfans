<pre>
awhile back there was a thread about injectors & leaks.... i discovered
2 of my 2.o injectors leaking at the seam where the plastic top fits
into the metal body... one more w/ bad pattern... also did some browsing
in a Bosch parts book 7 found that 73 2L &1.7 have same ecu (rebilt
Number is cu-13x), & that early vw 411 press sensor is same as 73 2L...
'75 injectors & ecu are different.. (but exactly HOW DIFFERENT)   does
anyone have acccess to actual flow data on injectors, since modifying
the engine might call for "fatter" injectors... & for that matter what
is the difference in injection character between the early 2L's & the
later more smog choked ones????.... and what real differences might one
expect from running the wrong ecu??  given that a lot of us are piecing
cars together at the local pick-yer-part, or have started our 914 lives
with cars that have who-knows-what parts hung on them by less careful
prior owners, getting access to real performance data on the central
parts would be real useful... (often the ecu number is unreadable)

another idea:  2.o bus has an Ljet system, which is friendlier to
performance mods, so has anyone tried adapting that setup onto a 914?
