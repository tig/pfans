The Ate rebuild kit, as well as the Haynes and other manuals, all show
exploded views of the entire M/C.

The failure circuit works like this:

There is a second bore, parallel to the primary one, in the M/C.  It's
pretty small (say, 0.375" diameter).  In it are two opposed "pistons"
w/seals, with their "heads" pointing at each other, and the seals behind
the heads. The brake fluid is on the far side of the seals, i.e. the fluid
is _not_ in the region where the piston heads are.  The fluid for one
piston comes from the front circuit, on its way to the brakes, and the
fluid for the other comes from the rear circuit, on its way to the brakes.

The idea is that if both circuits are working, these opposed pistons won't
move at all, because there's equal pressure behind each piston, at the
seals.  But if either half of the M/C fails (to build pressure), then the
"opposite" pistons will move towards the other, and in doing so it will
trip the brake warning light.

This would also happen if one of the bores ran dry. Note that it won't
detect anything if both bores run dry simultaneously.

Personally, I think this is a poor design, for several reasons:

1) More parts means a greater chance of failure,

2) A fluid-level detect in the reservoir would catch a fluid-loss problem
much earlier than this circuit, 

3) More parts means more expense (and more weight),

4) The "air pocket" where the opposed pistons face each other, and where
the safety switch intrudes into the M/C body, is silly -- why have air in
an M/C to begin with?  But it's required to protect the safety switch from
hydraulic pressure. It may even add to the spongy feeling of the M/C -- I'm
not certain of this, though.

5) and on and on ...

I've seen many Ate M/Cs on many European cars of 60-90's vintage, and none
of them use this method -- I presume it's pretty unique to Porsche. Perhaps
the thinking evolved from "It's more likely that the seals will fail, with
fluid still in there" to "It's more likely that the system will lose fluid
before the M/C seals fail." I've had M/C seals fail only once (in a Volvo
station wagon), and there was plenty of warning that something was going
South.
