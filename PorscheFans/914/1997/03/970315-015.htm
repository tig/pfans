Greetings p-nuts,

FOR SALE:
'71 2.2 ltr engine...very complete ("T" version)
-#6116170
-zenith carbs
-heat exchangers
-factory muffler
-in storage very long time, since later '70s

This engine is "supposedly low-mileage"...I've never heard it run, but it
turns over by hand just fine.  I bought it four years ago from a guy who
supposedly had been sitting on it for at least ten years, and HE bought it
from someone else who supposedly had sat on it since about '74 or so.  I
cannot verify any of this drivel...what we have here is an engine thats
needs to be fired up and used.  Physical appearance is very good...I was
going to play around with it over the winter, but haven't had the
time...so, it's for sale.
$1500 FOB Ridgecrest CA

I also have the mag-cased transmission that goes with the above...again, I
know absolutely nothing about it's actual condition, but it looks
good...I'm assuming that it's a five speed.  My price includes the CV
joints and shafts...one boot is torn, the others appear OK.
$350 FOB Ridgecrest CA

I'm hoping that these are realistic figures...please help me finish the 912
:) :)

thanks

Cheers
Thom Kuby
