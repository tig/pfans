  Mike, I hate to tell you this, but that "law"  (The Communications
Privacy Act of 198?) was, as so many laws are, enacted by a congress with
no understanding of the laws of physics, and no regard for them either.  It
was intended primarily to promote cellular telephone use, as it was common
knowledge back then that cellular telephone conversations were easily
monitered.  The cell tell companies response to their users concerns was to
lobby congress for this law.  It, of course doesn't mean that cellular
telephone conversations are any less easy to monitor, it just means that
for the first time in a free society, it is illegal to own certain types of
radio receivers, a legal precedent set principally in NAZI Germany and
Soviet Russia.
  The cell tell people, recognizing the futility of this approach, have
finally started to do what they should have done in the first place: go to
digital encryption.

  On the Internet, packets are un-encrypted, and bounce from node to node
all over the world.  There is no such thing as privacy. It is technically
not feasible, UNLESS both sender and recepient use encryption; PGP is
pretty good, you might want to check out their web site.  The problem is,
both parties have to set up an encryption scheme in advance; I don't find
it worth the trouble for the type of communication we do here, and it is
hardly compatible with a mailing list environment.  Therefore, whenever
using any electronic communications medium,  I use the simple expedient of
assuming that anyone in the entire world can read / hear what I say and
plan the content accordingly.  If I need to send something really private
(the need has not yet arisen) then I will send a floppy disk surface mail
encrypted with PGP.  

  I routinely quote others who write to this mailing list in general
postings, and often I will respond to a question that is specifically
addressed to me with a copy to the mailing list if I think that the subject
is of general interest to other Porsche owners.  I was not responsible for
repeating  the  text that you refer to, as it was not sent to me, but I
easily could have, and I think that your comments will have a chilling
effect on those of us who post to the list, if allowed to become the
general pattern.

  Therefore, I wish to publically notify the list that unless content of
any Electronic Mail that I receive is specifically labeled  "your eyes
only" or some such, it may very well be reproduced, in whole or in part, 
as part of a discussion of general interest to 914 owners.
