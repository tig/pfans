Jim, the spring is fitted to help make the pedal push easier, meaning the
spring helps you push the pedal.  You should adjust the clutch cable so it
is completely at the top of its travel, but when you push it, the top one
half inch of travel is lighter to push than the rest of the travel.  THIS
is the freeplay I am talking about. This, like you said, keeps the throwout
bearing from riding hard on the pressure plate.
