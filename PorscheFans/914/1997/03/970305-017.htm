    Andrew:

    For what it's worth, the one piece of Redline literature that I
    can find (I'm tearing my office apart and everything's in boxes)
    says:

        "75W90 Gear Oil -- Recommended for most street-driven and
        racing differentials.  Excellent performance in conventional
        and limited-slip units.  Also for limited-slip manual
        transaxles which require a 90-weight oil.  Additional
        limited-slip additives are not required.

        "75W90 NS -- Recommended for manual transmissions and
        non-limited-slip transaxles that recommend 90-weight oils.
        Can be used in racing limited-slip units to reduce wheel
        spin.  Street-driven rear-wheel-drive cars should use regular
        Redline 75W90 or 80W140."

    The upshot, I think, is that either one will work just fine in an
    open differential... The friction modifiers in 75W90 won't hurt
    anything.
