  Dion, there is no such line.  Up through 1973, there was a vacuum advance
as well as a vacuum retard, but starting in 1974, the vacuum advance was
done away with.  The second distributor vacuum port (the one on the side
farthest from the distributor proper) is left open to the atmosphere.

  The decel valve is a California emissions package item;  if you are not
trying to pass smog in california, then you can dispense with it.  To do
this, plug all ports that it connects to. 

						Good Luck,
