Thanks for all who responded to my plea for help concerning my steering (I 
got 9 responses in all!).  The general concensus was that the castor was not 
correct (causing the lack of "on-center" feel) and /or that the toe out was 
too great ("dartiness").  I checked the allignment specs against the 
recommended specs and found that both the toe and castor was at the outside 
of the recommended range, but were within spec.

camber     actual:  L =  -.3    R = .2        recommended:  -.3   to    .3
caster        actual:  L = 6.6    R = 6.5      recommended:  5.5  to  6.5
toe              actual:  L = .12    R = .11      recommended:  .04  to  .12

I talked to NTW who did the allignment, told them about the various changes 
I've made to the front end, and they suggested that the steering column 
might be binding just enough to keep the wheel from returning to center. 
 They said they'd be happy to re-allign it and decrease the toe to whatever 
I wanted - no charge (carries a 1 year warranty), but while they agreed that 
would decrease the "dartiness", it wouldn't have any effect on "on-center" 
feel.

Prior to the allignment, I installed rack spacers (by the way, I have 0 bump 
steer now!), so I suppose it is possible that I have created a "bind" on the 
steering column by pushing the rack closer to the steering wheel (I know 
that's not a very technical description, but think about it and you'll 
understand what I mean).

If my understanding is correct, I will have to remove the gas tank and 
loosen the pinch-bolt on the U-joint that attaches the steering column to 
the steering rack and can "shorten" the column at that point.

Any thoughts on any of  this?

Thanks again.
