I think it was Josh who wrote that he wanted to know if the rear left
fender was an obivios place to tell a true "6" or not.

Well no, I can duplicate the inner fender cutouts for the tank, just the
way Karmann did them.

Here is what I look for:
1) VIN r S/N starts with 914 - the rest of use got stuck with VW numbers
2) The gas tank never had an expansion tank mounted to it.
3) the washer bottle is different, only an outlet.  And they had an
electric washer pump
4) Ignition switch is on the dash
5) Hand throttel lever  by the shifter
6) The tail shifter is slightly different on a "6" than a "4" the casting
for he selector rod is not as long.  And on the other side is a bell -
crank mounts for the throtel cable.
7) the shifter mechinism bars are different.
8) the relay board is different in the engine compartment, and also
mounted different.
9) The orginal "6" engine lid has different sized torsion bars.
10) Real sixes use only a center engine mount. - I have an extra one, but
will probally use a 911 style dual mount.

My top ten list, other items are to easily added or modified to look
correct.

Take care,
