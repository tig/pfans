I don't understand a statement you made in your letter Jason, and
perhaps you
could clarify for me; >>Have you Perry, ever bought a part for your 914
simply because you have found one that is better than yours?  I have
invested
over $21,000 in the car I purchased from Automobile Atlanta, not
including
the purchase price of $14,000.  I have personally repaired any and all
rust
on the car I purchased from your company.  I have entirely corrosion
treated
the car, uprgraded the entire suspension and brakes, had the
transmission
entirely rebuilt, repainted the engine bay and rear trunk, replaced all
weather seals, installed custom gauges, custom leather interior, new
wool
carpet, coverted to a six with a rebuilt 3.0, and other things that I
can't
remember (but should!).

Just for the record Jason, I have five 914's including; three 914-6's
which
includes the conversion car, a 80,000 mile California 914-6 that is
truly
rust free in every way and non standard color, a real '74 2.0 currently
in
restoration,  a '71 parts car, and my recent aqusition of a 914-6 with
only
5864 miles.  The car I purchased from your company, and subsequently
repaired
won the best of show at the last Mid-West Renegade Festival, and won
best in
it's class at the first MWRF recieving more votes than any other car
(before
there was a best of show).  I spend a minimum of thirty hours every
quarter
working on the Club Newsletter, and countless telephone calls regarding
Club
business and activities.  I do not do this for pay, and receive no
payment
for time spent doing any Club related business.  I have spent my own
money
making improvements in our Club Newsletter, simply because I want it to
represent these cars that mean so much to so many people.  I do no know
you
Jason, have absolutely no quarrel with you, or no reason to dislike you,
do
not however, doubt my dedication to the 914.  

In reality, my personal decision to discontinue any and all transactions
with
your company has not been easy.  You do have parts that are not easily
available elsewhere.  For this you are to be commended.  For this reason
I
feel it is only fair to put the decision regarding advertising to our
Members.  Our Club is a not for profit organization, advertising we sell
helps defray expenses.  Our advertising rates are a fraction of what
other
puplications and web pages charge.  It is our intent to conduct business
in a
manner that is in the best interest of our Members, with no and for no
pecuniary gains by any individual.  Whenever possible and logistically
feasible, we put decision making to the Members.  I welcome the
opportunity
for further dialogue Jason.

Sincerely,

Perry M. Kiehl
Vice President
Porsche 914 Club
