The "feel" of 1/4" toe in? What do they normally drive? A Buick? Yoiks!
1/4" of front toe in, the car will strongly resist turning.

Toe out on the rear should be for a car that in trully intended for
autox, or for a car that understeers so badly that other suspension
changes aren't sufficient. I would not feel safe driving my car on the
freeway if I had toe out in the rear. BTDT. If it were say a dodge neon,
that's another story. But we're talking about mid engined rear drive
cars right now.

Find out what kind of equipmet they're using.

Egads! How'd you get that much camber in the front? Is there damage?
Were the strut towers modified? I've opened up the slots on my strut
towers to get me up to -2.0 degrees of camber, any more and I'd have to
open up the center hole in the tower, and that's not legal in my rule
book.

Take it to another shop. If you've got almost 1.5 degrees of stagger,
then this shop doesn't know what it's doing. They may claim to do race
cars, and that may be true. They might only do oval track cars. Either
way, take it to another shop. Contact the local PCA or SCCA, and see if
you can get recomendations for an alignment shop in your area. What area
do you live in?

> Thanks for the rest of your thoughtful feedback, Joshua.

least I can do for a fellow 'teener. Can I get a ride in your 3.0 914
someday? I know someone who has built a very well sorted 914-6SC with
stock fenders, and he says that 205/50-15 tires are simply insufficient
for the 3.0 motor.
