	There are three difficult parts to doing a valve adjust on your
914.  One is simply getting your adjusting hardware (feeler gauges,
screwdriver, wrench, hands) into where the rocker arms live.  That one
you'll have to work out on your own, from *every* angle...  I like to
pull the rear wheel off for slightly better access.
	Next is the problem of rotating the engine.  I personally put
only one side of the car in the air at a time, put the transmission in
5th, and use a lever on two of the re-installed lug bolts to turn the
hub.  Some sources recommend using a screwdriver on the fan blades.  I
think that is a very good way to wreck your fan, even if you are careful.
	The final problem is figuring out where TDC for whichever cyl-
inder is.  Putting extra paint marks on the fan is not a bad idea.
There should already be a little painted notch on the rear part of the
fan, but that can be hard to see.  You can put a paint mark on the front
part of the fan that corresponds to it.
	For 180 out from that, you can simply count blades and blocks.
There are four bigger "blocks" on the fan, where the bolts that hold the
two halves of it together go.  They are spaced 90 degrees apart, and
there are an equal number of blades between each.  Count N blades from
the nearest block, then go two blocks and count N blades again and you
have 180 degrees out from the TDC mark.
	I have done the same thing to the flywheel.  There was already a
notch for TDC, and I put a paint mark on 180 out.  This eliminates having
to get up and look at the top when turning the engine over, as I can see
both marks through the notch in the bottom of the tranny bellhousing.

	I think I'm the only one who disagrees with the method Dirk
described.  All I know is that I once checked the clearance of one valve
while its cylinder-mate was open, and the clearance was rather larger
than when that same cylinder was at TDC.  This was on a motor of unkown
age and condition.  George's reply, at the time, was that the geometry of
the whole cam-lifter-pushrod-rocker arm system *could* sometimes make it
appear as if the base circle of the cam got smaller.
	I personally feel better doing the adjust "my way".  Is it the
only "right way"?  Nope.  But it seems to have worked so far for me.
