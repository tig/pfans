I'd appreciate the lists' pooled experience on the following from either an 
experience or a theoretical viewpoint.
1. Has anybody passed a smog (HC sniffer) test with Webers on a 914?  If so, 
what was your setup (jets, timing, "tricks", etc.)?
2. Regarding 40 IDFs:
- 2a. What's the maximum engine displacement they can effectively handle?
- 2b. Venturi size is 28mm?
- 2c. I currently use F11 tubes with 125 main jets and 200 (or maybe 180) air 
jets - comments?
3. Regarding 44 IDFs:
- 3a. What's the minimum and maximum engine displacement they can effectively 
handle?
- 3b. Venturi size is 32mm?
- 3c. What are the typical tube, main and air jet sizes for street driving 
(and alternatives for performance and emissions)?
4. Can the venturis be swapped easily (versus a press fit, for instance) from 
40s to 44s and vice versa?
5. How would performance differ with 44s compared to 40s (e.g., torque peak 
higher in the rpm band)?
6. How would HC emissions differ with 44s compared to 40s (e.g., they let 30% 
more air through, would this decrease unburnt HCs if the main jets weren't 
increased proportionally)?

I'm willing to put what I get into a FAQ for others to use (so you won't be 
asked the same stuff in a few months by someone else).  Thanks greatly,
