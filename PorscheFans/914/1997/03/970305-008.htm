In response to Ken korn putting MTL in his 901 tranny, Andy Warren writes:

Careful here ... My read of their 75W90 is that it is intended for
limited-slip rear ends (primarily).  75W90NS (the "other" 75W90 from
RedLine) is intended for non-limited-slip (hence the "NS" designation, I
guess) rear ends.  To wit:

75W90: "This product is not designed for use in most manual transmissions
with copper-containing synchros, ..."

75W90NS: "... has improved copper corrosion protection which prolongs the
life of synchronizers."

The 75W90NS bottle goes on to state that  "Some autocross applications may
use mixtures of the 75W90 and 75W90NS gear oils for the best balance
between lockup and chatter."

(Personally, I think these two labels are very confusing, as there is too
much implicit information in them (e.g. transmission vs. transaxle,
sometimes explicitly mentioned, othertimes not.)).

So, my read is to use the 75W90NS in the 914's 901 tranny, assuming you
don't have a limited-slip diff.  I've been doing so for several years, w/no
problems whatsoever -- pretty smooth shifting, and no problems at all
during PCA Time Trials.

Regardless, MTL is the wrong lube for the 901 tranny -- I'd get it out of
there quick!
