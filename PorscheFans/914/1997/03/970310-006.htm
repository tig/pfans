If you have adjusted your e-brake cables as far as they will go and they 
still won't do the job, your inner pad clearance is too great and needs to 
be adjusted.  This is an adjustment that a lot of owners either don't know 
about or choose to ignore and compensate by replacing pads more frequently. 
 Tightening the e-brake as the pads wear also compensates for this, but only 
up to about 1/2 the pad wear, then you need to adjust them.  This will also 
result in a much better brake pedal feel (ever noticed how much better the 
pedal feels with the e-brake engaged?).

I don't have my manual here, but the correct clearance is pretty small (like 
..06 or something - check your manual).  To adjust it, you have to remove the 
plug from the inner side of the rear brake caliper.  Access to the plug is 
through the hole in the trailing arm.  If I remember correctly, the plug is 
a 4 or 6mm Allen-bolt and is a real bitch to get loose.  I had to remove 
each of my rear calipers, put them in a bench vise, and use every trick in 
the book to get the bastards loose.  Once removed, there is a small 
adjusting screw inside and can be turned (with a 4mm allen I think) to 
adjust the venting clearance.  Make sure the E-brake is NOT engaged and that 
it is adjusted most of the way LOOSE before adjusting the venting clearance. 


I replaced my stripped out plugs with the stainless steel hex-bolt style 
available from Automotion or Performance so I would (hopefully) be able to 
remove them easier the next time.

Hope this helps
