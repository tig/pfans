	I had a couple of people look at my piston top when the same
thing happened to me.  They told me that *this* moon-shaped divot
wasn't a problem.  It was shallow, wasn't into the ring lands (???),
and basically wasn't in an area that had "important things" going on
(like rings, wrist pins, etc.).  The consensus was to file down the
sharp edges and run it.  "It'll fill up with carbon in no time."
	So far (only a couple K miles) I've had no further problems
(with the pistons, at least!).
