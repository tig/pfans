Keith,

You will not like the answer, but here it is, what ever percent the
displacement increase is.  If that is all you do, the total seals will
help a little, but not a lot, mainly they keep your compression ratio
true, not a loss % for each piston.

So if you go from a 1.8 to a 1.9 you would cain a whole whooping 7.6 or
so HP.  If you figure the P/C will cost you lets say, $300 that would
become a $39.47 dollar per HP expenditure.

Now what can you do, to get more power?????  Lets see a injection
friendly cam, better air flow, better exhaust, make the thing breath
better, after all it is an air pump.  If you are dead set on upgrading
this engine, looking to better breathing and don't worry about a bore
kit.  We are all a long way away from 100hp per liter, the magic number
that I would love to get to.  But even the new Boxster is at best 91.67
BHP per liter.  After 25 years of evolution Porsche still has not made it
with a normally aspirated engine.  But remember this is the Boxster and
Porsche loves to pull an extra 10hp out of its hat each year just to make
up for the 100 pounds of stuff it has added.

Out on the wild end of things and engines, congrads you opened the door,
you can go with a set of 911 heads, twin plugs, and custom cams and
exhaust.  I know of a couple beetles running around with just such
engines, very interesting beasts, and very fast auto-x weapons in Europe.
 Now that I started this ball rolling somebody please note, it is not a
conversion for the weak of heart and it is not a simple bolt on.  Sure
the heads will bolt down, but then with a hammer and a big enough wrench
I can make anything BOLT together, or break a lot of bolts trying. :^) 
BTW, the above are rumored to produce 200hp, and use mechanical
injection.

Oh, you could always go with a turbo, been done a couple of times, and
well done.  It is a bolt on but requires allot of foresight and
engineering time to get correct, MSDS, used to sell a kit, don't know if
they still do.

Enjoy.
