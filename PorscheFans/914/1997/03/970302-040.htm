Frank, "Mid Engined Views" is the official publication of the 914 Owners
Association.  Dennis Deeds has been kind enough to operate this 914 owners
exchange/information/yearly reunion for years, and the club has over 5000
members worldwide. The Porsche Factory officially recognizes the club and
Dennis always seems to get the inside scoop on any 914 activity as well as
the latest Factory news.  The club is well worth joining, as, for 30.00 per
year, you receive the bimonthly news magazine, tech service and invitation
to the annual east and west coast reunions. Dennis can be called at 619 325
6583 or written at 100 South Sunrise Way Suite 116 Palm Springs, Ca. 92262.
  By the way Frank, do you have our 914 catalog?  The information is in there.
