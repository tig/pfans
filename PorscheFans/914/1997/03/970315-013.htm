In following your thoughts on valve material, I'm wondering if there is any 
substantial difference between using a 2.0 head for conversion to "big valves" 
versus using a 1.8 head.  Since the 2.0's sodium cooled valves would no longer 
be an issue, you basically have only the 3 vs. 4 intake manifold studs and 
location of spark plug to distinguish the two (if I'm incorrect, please 
inform).

The application I'm thinking of is an extra 1.8 engine (not running) I have 
that I'd like to take out to 2.5 liters (with 75mm stroke) or 2.6 liters (with 
78mm stroke) using 103mm p/c's either way.  I could use my 2.0 engine as a 
base, but it only has maybe 50 hours on the valve/ring job, great oil 
pressure, etc., so I'd rather sell it to someone looking for that since 
they're not easy to find in good condition (don't take this as an ad - I'm not 
ready to proceed with the big engine yet).

Also, do any of you know if I could simply drill two additional holes in the 
intake runners for my Webers to use them on 1.8 heads (with 1.8 gaskets, of 
course)?  Thanks for the input,
