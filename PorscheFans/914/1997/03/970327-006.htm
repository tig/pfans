	Actually, the ECU boxes appear to be interchangeable between
many of the 914s.  The 1.8s are different, of course, since they have
a different FI system.  However, the later (72+) 1.7s and the early
(73-4) 2.0s have pretty much the same ECU.  The parts manual lists a
single part number for both.
	It appears that they originally came with slightly different
boxes (at least different part #'s in the factory maint manual), but
that the replacement unit is the same for both.
	You should be able to use the same box with the early 1.7s as
well; I think the main difference is that the early ones shut off the
fuel entirely on overrun (decel, throttle closed) over ??? RPM, while
the later ones have the idle mixture tweaker on top of the box.

	You had mentioned using other 2.0 FI components as well--but
the 1.7 and 2.0 MP sensors are interchangeable as well.  You can re-
calibrate one into the other by tweaking the adjusting screw.  And
Kjell Nelin's article (previously mentioned) said that by doing this,
he found it unneccesary to go to 2.0 injectors.
	Remember, this is all free advice--and worth every penny!
