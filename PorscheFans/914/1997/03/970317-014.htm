True, but unless there was an engine fire, or it sat outside in snow and
rain for years, the existing harness should be simple enough to repair.

True as well, but rebuilding/repairing one is not difficult.

Why do you need a _new_ disributor? Did yours break in half or
something?

> Are new throttle bodies available?

Why do you need a _new_ throttle body? Egads, if a used component is so
bad that you feel the need to get completely new parts then why do you
own a 25 year old sports car. There are _plenty_ of very good to
excelent quality used parts available for a fraction of the new price
and are just as good. The 914 has quite a loyal following and there are
many suppliers of quality used parts out there.

I'm not following you here. The factory supports nothing that is 914
specific short of sheet metal. It's the rest of us that keep the breed
alive. Places like AA, Ottos's, High Performance House, and countless
other 914 parts houses that help all of us defray the cost of restoring
a vintage sports car.

But you won't be able to drive it on the street. There may only be a few
states right now that are actively enforcing the SMOG II laws. But don't
be fooled into thinking that those states that don't are going to stay
that way. If you intend on keeping your car as a street driven 914, then
you must keep the D-jet. I would guess that the parts you need are not
as numerous as it seems. 

Carbs are great for racing, if only because you have no choice in many
classes. But you will not find many carbed 914s that run anywhere near
as well as a well tuned D-jet system. Yes, it takes time, patience, and
some money to get a D-jet working well if it's been neglected. But you
will find it's worth it in the end. 
And it won't be that much different from cabs in the end.
