That's what I think. The SSIs and the Bursch made me think "Why would
you replace the entire exhaust system if there was only 8500 miles on
the car?". And "Why can't I find an engine number?". So I figure that
the car is probably a low miles car, but not _that_ low. All of the
drainage hoses are still very intact under the body, and the
undercoating looks great. But 8500 miles with a new engine and exhaust?
I don't think so. The heads are 2.0, or at least they have teh right
number of studs for the intake runners. Maybe the engine is a good 2.0,
but not original. I didn't actually talk to the owner, it's a
consignment deal. I couldn't find any rust, well a wee bit on the batery
tray, and just a wee bit. I crawled almost all the way into the engine
looking for rust (For those of you whom I havn't met, I _am_ short
enough to do it if I really tried) and only found it on the tray itself.
Would I offer $15k? Only if had a secret compartment in the bottom of
the gas tank filled with gold bars or diamonds. 

The moral? There _are_ excelent condition 914s out there, you just need
to convince the owners to sell them at reasonable prices. This one is
_beyond_ reason. Maybe they'll go down, I doubt it. That car'll never
sell except to a sucker, and we all know often they come around...
