Jeff,

I'd replace the bushings in the pedal assembly while you're at it. No telling 
what the brake fluid has done to the bushings in there.  I'm doing mine, so if 
you do yours first, you can show me the way!  :)  Besides, I've got a sticky 
brake pedal (it stays part way down after I engage the brakes) and I'd like to 
replace with bronze bushings anyway.

Don't feel bad, since I've been out of town so much (currently in Boston as I 
type), mine won't be on the road for the first autocross either.  I still have to 
paint, put the fresh engine back in, and bleed the brakes.  Last weekend I did 
put new Koni sports on the rear as well as a new set of Weltmeister 140# springs. 
 By the way, we will make the first Akron Sports Car Club autocross in April with 
the ACR.  Hopefully the 914 will be done for the May driver's school.  We're also 
running Nelson's Ledges on May 5th.  The club rented it for a day.  Again, 
probably with the ACR.

Later,

Dion
