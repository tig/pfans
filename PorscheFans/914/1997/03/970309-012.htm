OK, I'm stumped.  I'll admit that I am not a guru on air-cooled engines
(yet), but I really need the list's help naming a part protruding from my 75
2.0 engine which has been frozen and non-functional for at least a year, and
doesn't appear in any manual or catalog (that I can find).

Directly above the sight hole cover on thr rear cooling blower housing (just
in from of the oil fill), there is a part which looks like an alternator or
an air pump. The only thing coming out of it is a hose (1/4 - 1/2 inch) that
goes nowhere.

There is a pulley (2 inch, frozen) pointing toward the front, which I assume
is belt-driven from a small pulley (2 inch) sticking out from the fan.  I
don't see this fan pulley in any diagram either.

The number plate on the part has a VW emblem on the top left, followed by
the number 021.131.601. The next line reads "Bosch", and the third line
reads 0.588.002.001.  I can't seem to cross reference any of these numbers
in any catalog.

Thanks in advance,
Jeffrey Dunning
