I recently had a 4 wheel alignment done by the local P dealer and paid for
by my insurance (so I don't think they hurried it). I have the printout
showing the resulting alignment specs and they are very close to factory.
My car also doesn't have much if any inclination to return to center. The
turnin is very quick. If I turn, the car tends to continue the turn unless
I steer back. It's not particularly sensitive but you do have to keep track
of where you are going. If the road is smooth, the car continues in the
direction it's going. 

I also have the Yoko A509's in 195/60x15 on 6 1/2 inch Minilite wheels. I
like them so far. A friend with a Toyota MR2 just put a set on his car and
thinks they're not as sticky as the Pirelli P6000 he had before. Also
thinks the 509 sidewalls are stiffer.
