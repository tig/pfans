Hello Fellow 914 Fans,
 I would just like to put my 2 cents worth here. I dont know about
everyone else, but I personally, am sick and tired of 1 or 2 people out
here on the net trying to drag AA through the mud.Let me start by saying
I am not affiliated with them in anyway. I am just sick of having to read
E-mail talking about the same person with the same car that he bought 5
years ago from them. Get over it! I can not escape hearing about this
incident no matter where I go on the net, the Renegade
Page,Porschefans,anywhere I go to check out my favorite 914 spots. I
understand Perry's situation but I have also spent $20,000 on my 74 2.0.
What was the purchase price? $2,700.00! I have not stepped back and
regretted spending the money just to blame the person I bought the car
from. I love my 914 and would not trade the world for it. I too opened a
can of worms when I dissasembled my car but the person I bought it from
had no clue of the rust that was hiding. George has pulled a rabbit out
of a hat for me more than once in this project of mine and I thank him
for being here for us.
