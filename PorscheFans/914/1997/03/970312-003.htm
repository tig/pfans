>>The location is just so-so it keeps the temp down for a while but once
it 
gets up there (250-275) it stays there. The air flow is just not good. My

buddy has a mazda rx7 cooler mounted in the front trunk and popped out 
the cap plugs on the front of the trunk to get air in, and a few holes in

floor to let it out, and that works great.<<

You may also be able to get by the no holes drilled rule, if you play
your cards right.  The plugs in the front pop out.  No drilling required,
there are two plugs in the floor covered by seam sealer.  The biggest
trick is mounting the cooler, which may work off a clever mount that uses
the horn nuts or the holes/plugs for the fog light mounts.  Or take the
wiring out for the horn and the fog lights and use that hole.  No
drilling required.  For the duct work leave the tire cover board in
place.  Not as good as a direct duct, but a little better than having the
whole cavity in the air flow.  Or you may be able to vent out the cowl if
you remove the seals and the fresh air blower duct, but then, it may not
flow well enough to maintain air flow.

BTW, I got the RX-7 oil cooler at a junk yard for $10.00 you pull it
deal.  What a great cooler it is.  Quality is among the best around.

Take care,
