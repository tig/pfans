As long as the stuff is still available, we should be happy to pay whatever
it takes to get it.  I paid $200 for a new drivers armrest top two months
ago to complete my near perfect 76 2.0 driver and was happy to get it for
that price.  Remember a 914 is not a cheap car to restore, but the
satisfaction of driving it more than makes up for the cost.
