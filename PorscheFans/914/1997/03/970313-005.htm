Hello Jeff, 

 Feeling better, I hope.
  Those front rotor must have been on a car with GT flares, I have never
seen stud that long on the front before. My mechanic said to put a open
end lug (steel) on the stud then cut then with a hack saw (measure the
rear first) and then file down the cut and unscrew the lug (steel) and
your done, or

Find out hold long of a stud you need and buy new ones, the stock stud
lenth for 15X6's are 45mm, but thats if its pressed in to a 911 hat
which you dont have, but is the 914 rotor and a 911 hat the same
thickness ?????

 Thats all I know, good luck, 

 Don
 73 Six

 If I only knew then what I know now......................
