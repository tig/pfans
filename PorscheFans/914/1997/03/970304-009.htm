You've got to find out where that fluid is going before doing anything 
else. A resevoir of fluid should be easy to spot (then again maybe not 
:-)).  

Since you've decided to do the rebuild, a point to remember is that the 
seals go on the pistons in specific directions. You shouldn't hone the 
bore, but do check it for scratches. If it's scratched up, toss it and 
get a new one. Better to be safe than sorry.
