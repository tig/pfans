>= above message received and edited by me, Mike Cooley
This is posted to ALL on the list since the message I will answer was likewise.

The article NEVER said to drill a hole in the firewall.
One hole in the passenger side FOOTWELL and 2 holes in the COVER of the
steering rack pan for the bolts and nuts. That is the only holes mentioned
in the article I was reading or my post to the list.
Must be a good alternate location choice since PORSCHE did recommend it to
Automobile Atlanta.

BTW, someone posted the (snipped above) message to me as personal e-mail.
How did you get it?
When I send personal messages, they are personal. When I receive personal
e-mail, the privacy is always guaranteed no matter what the subject may be
unless the identical worded mail is also posted to the entire 914 list by
sender. Lets hope all feel as I do about privacy of e-mail no matter how how
trivial it may be.

Its not freedom of speech, its an invasion of privacy. This is not my
opinion. Its the law.
