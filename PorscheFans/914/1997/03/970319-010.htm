<< That'd be the best way to go, but in some competition classes (like
 mine), hub and brake modifications are not allowed. So converting to
 five lug hubs and wheels is a no no.

I understand that brake and hub modifications are illegal in stock
class...SCCA,PCA,PCA club racing ......With carbs already on,he is running in
an improved class where the above modifications are legal...I realize that
most all of us work our way up,piece at a time, to the limit of the rules
......trying along the way to maximize the bang for the buck theory ....and I
think for the amount of money to buy a new set of wheels you could upgrade
the suspension on the whole for the same amount of bucks . I've seen 911
struts for a couple hundred bucks .....sets of 15x6 and 15x7 Fuchs wheels for
500 bucks ........Last time I called Revolution, 15x6 4 lug wheels were about
300 to 350 plus shipping .......There's a lot 1000 bucks will buy for a 914
.........spend it wisely unless your filthy rich........
   Personally, I would build to National rules, whichever they may be
.........unless all your ever going to run is your hometown stuff....
