Hey Nick, Mike, list, 

 Thats kinda the way I see it too. By the time Im done with it about the
only item with the 74,563 miles on it will be the body, totaly rebuilt
suspension, eng, tran, bearings, you name it it will be new, so why not
start with 0 miles on the odomiter.

 But Mike dose bring up a good point about loosing the claim to being a
low mileage car, which I also believe is the original milage, though
with a 23 year old car I think most people would think it was a 174,563
anyway , no matter what the odometer said or what I told them.

 Either way, after dumping 20 grand in the car the receipts should speak
fro them selves, plus I will never recover that kinda money on a
conversion car anyway.

Thanks for the thoughts, 
 Don
