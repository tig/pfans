	Good question.  You can answer the question in a number of ways;
one is to take the car somewhere that has an exhaust gas analyzer and let
them hook it up.  Another is to get once yourself.  A third is to check
the color of the insulator near the electrode of the spark plugs.  If you
want to do this, then let the engine get nice and warm (drive it for a
while).  Then, while you're driving at part-throttle on an EMPTY STREET
(important!), turn the engine off, clutch and coast to a stop.  Remove
the plugs THEN and THERE.  If you drive into your garage and then check
them, you're only checking the idle mixture.
	If the white insulator near the electrode looks black and sooty,
you're running rich.
	If you are, possible sources include fuel pressure (defective reg-
ulator or improperly hooked up vacc hose), always-on thermo-time switch or
leaking/faulty cold start valve, a bad air flow meter, and probably more
that I can't think of.
	You could try tweaking the bypass screw in the air-flow meter.  I
am unclear on whether it affects the mixture over the full range of con-
ditions, or only at idle.  Tighten it (CW) for richer, loosen it (CCW) for
leaner.
	As Jason suggested, you can also tweak the mixture (full-range) by
putting a potentiometer (variable resistor) in series with the head temp
sensor.
	If you're not running too rich, check for binding in the brakes
or other extra drag, fuel leaks...  Other things?

	Good luck!
