I'll bet it's your smog pump.  It mounts atop your fan housing, is
driven by a pulley mounted to the fan, and the hose attaches to the air
injector pipes.  It sounds like you're missing your injector pipes,
other wise I think the connection would be fairly obvious.  The air
pipes connect to the heads on either side of the intake runners, wrap
around the back of the engine, and up to within 8 inches of the smog
pump.  If you don't need this part and plan on stripping it off, I would
love to buy the rubber mount that the smog pump's pulley uses to mount
to the fan.  I've been looking for one for ever.

Thanks,
