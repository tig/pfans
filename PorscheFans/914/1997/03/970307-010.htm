Recently I have not been receiving the 914 Digest.  Thinking that it was 
possible that my e-mial address had somehow been deleted (possibly my 
mistake) from the subscriber list, I decided to "rejoin".  I got a reply 
that I was already a member.
OK...if I'm already a member, then why am I not receiving the routine 
postings of the digest?  My system seems to be fine, since I do get the 
regular postings of the 911 and the Race Digests.
When I check the "archives", there are many recent dates with large 914 
digests for which I never received the original postings.
Am I alone, or are others having the same experience?
What can be done to begin to once again receive the regular 914 
Digest postings?
Thanks in advance for advice.
