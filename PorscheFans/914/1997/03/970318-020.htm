    Yeah, Don... Even if they're stress-relieved to remove the
    stress-risers from the drilling process, and even if the holes
    are chamfered, the metal right next to each hole cools faster
    than the metal further away.  The uneven heating/cooling makes
    them crack.

    Troutman does good work -- I just recommended them in private
    e-mail to another list-member who was looking for slotted rotors
    -- but even the best shops can't overcome the basic laws of
    physics.

    In fact, even the wildly-expensive Porsche racing rotors that
    had the holes CAST in (rather than drilled) crack... It's
    unavoidable.

    Ok, I won't tell you... But if you carefully inspect each rotor
    periodically, you MAY be able to see cracks just starting to
    form and replace the rotors before they do any serious damage.
