I to purchased a set of 2.0 L heads from Stephens. My engine has been put
back together but has not yet been installed in the car yet.  My worries
over exhaust valve temp were explained away as above.  My engine is a
little more than "stock" and will keep the group apprised of ANY problems
that are associated with these heads.
