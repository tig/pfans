Based on a thread I started earlier this winter, there are 2 schools of
thought regarding battery relocation for autocrossing.

(1) Move to the front for more even weight distribution.

(2) Move to the rear to put more weight on the drive wheels.

Since choice #2 also shortens the cables needed and does not require me to
then relocate the spare tire for road use (it's out for autocrossing), I am
opting for choice #2.

THE CHANGE HAS NOT BEEN MADE YET, SO IF YOU ARE GOING TO CONVINCE ME
OTHERWISE, DO IT NOW.

Thanks,
Jeffrey Dunning
