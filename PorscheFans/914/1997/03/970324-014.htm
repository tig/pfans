	Very well could be.  The valve may not be broken, though--it sounds
as if it could be incorrectly plumbed.
	Assumption:  The 912E decel valve is the same as the 2.0L 914 one.
Now, when you apply a high vaccuum to the small line going into the end of
the decel valve, the valve should let air through from the big hose in the
one side to the big hose on the other end.  The small hose should "see"
manifold vaccuum, as should one of the large hoses, while the other large
hose should "see" ambient air pressure (e.g., air from the air cleaner
housing).
	If you get everything hooked up, then pull the line off the air
cleaner housing, then rev up the engine to 3500 RPM or so and let off.  The
end that was disconnected (not blocked!) from the air cleaner should suck in
air.  If it does, the valve is working.
	If the valve really is dead, you'll need to check all over Helen
Back to find it; it's NLA as far as I know.  Check wrecking yards, check the
mail-order shops, check everywhere.
	http://www.automatrix.com/~skip/volkswagen/bosch-fi.html has a nice
cross-reference for some of the FI parts with various years and models of VW
Buses (and possibly other cars as well).

	Good luck!
