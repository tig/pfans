Lots of options, lots of money too. Revolution and Panasport are teh
better wheels out there for wider 4-lug wheels. And 15X7 is common
enough to find without difficulty. It's the size the ITA 914s use.
That's what I'm looking for myself.

Wider wheels _do_ help. The wider the wheel, the less sidewall flex you
will have to deal with. Idealy a 205/50-15 should be sitting on as wide
a rim as it can, namely a 15x8. It all depends on the money I guess.
Also what kind of competition you're doing. I know that in autocross,
the wider wheels are only really usefull on concrete surfaces, where
tire adhesion is so much better than on asphalt. The R1 has a very stiff
sidewall, and hence is much more resistant to flex than say the hoosier
or yokohama. So the need for wider rims is not as severe. That's why so
many of us run R1s on 5.5 inch rims.

But before making any upgrades to your car, read the rules. You don't
want to find yourself facing fire-breathing-trailer-riding-monsters
because of an ill chosen modification or upgrade.
