I really don't have a problem using 1.7 and 1.8 parts for 914-6
restoration. Cutting up a 2.0 is a shame though.

Well, seing as how all of the 914 ever made were hand built, they're
_all_ different. Different welds, different cable locations, different
holes etc. 
I know that a little more care was taken with the original 6's, but I
couldn't say that there really are differences that can't be duplicated.

I'd hazzard a guess and say that the left rear fender would be the tell
tale spot. The original oil tank installation would probably be the best
indicator. Any concours judges out there?

Generally, when one does a 6 conversion, it's not done to original 914-6
specs. Why would it? When it's easier and almost cheaper to bolt in an
SC front end and 3.0 engine, rather than build an authentic 2.0 engine
and install a (ick) tailshifter transaxle. Usually conversions are done
to 1.7s or 1.8s and when they're done, they're sooo much better than an
original 6. Not that original 6 doesn't deserve restoration, it
absolutely does. But if I were to do a conversion, I'd go all out.
Converting a car to perfect original 6 specs I think would cost more
than a modern conversion.
