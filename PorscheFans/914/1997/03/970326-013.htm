 Paul,

     This is a relatively new thing, the theory as i understand it, is the cryo
     freezing (slow cool down, hold at the -200 deg for a while, then a sloooowwww
     warm up back to room temp) somehow relieves any stress risers within the
     grain/crystalline structure of the metal. It doesn't have anything to do with
     the heat treat process, this is done on already finished parts, ie post heat treat.
     The biggest users so far are gun owners, who send in thier rifle barrels and receivers
     for this cryo process. All who use it report increases in accuracy, some marginal
     but some are substantial. Don't know, I haven't sent my rifles in :^)
     Hope this answers your question, though maybe it's all a bunch of hooey.
