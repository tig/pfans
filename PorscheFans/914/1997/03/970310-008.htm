I'm about to pull my engine for the third time, and I got to thinking
(always leads to trouble) about different methods for getting the engine
out.  The typical method is to jack the car up, support the engine with
a floor jack, disconnect it from the car, and lower the engine and roll
it out.  What if rather than that, I slid a furniture dolly under the
jacked-up car, lowered the car until the engine rested on the dolly,
disconnected the engine from the car, and then jacked the car back up
and rolled the engine out?  I realize I'd have to find a furniture dolly
that would be high enough to have the engine rest on it while the car is
lowered, but if I can, it seems like it might be a little easier.  It
also seems like it could be done by one person without any trouble.  Am
I crazy?

Thanks,
