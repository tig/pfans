Yes, you should refinish and rebuild your pedal cluster. But, be aware 
that this is what lead me to take most of my car apart! I went gonzo on 
the cluster - completely disassenble it, get parts blasted, then zinc 
chromate plated, then reassemble with bronze bushings, then cold galvanize 
painted, then painted black. It sure looks nice sitting on the shelf in my 
storage facility. 

If you have the money, and it's legal in your class, do the BMW 320i 
brake upgrade while you have the system apart.

Rack spacers are easier to do with the master cylinder out of the way, 
too. 

Once you have the pedal cluster out, sand off the rust on the floor, and 
get a sharp heavy duty scraper and hammer off the bituminus insulation 
because you'll find rust under it for sure. Refinish the floor. Also, the 
floor of the shifter tunnel will most likely be rusty, too, so it's good 
time to refinish that. Also, it's much easier to replace the fuel lines 
in the shifter tunnel with the cluster out, if you need to do that. 
Finally, unless the two supply tubes to the master cylinder come off of it 
easily, then you're going to have to pull the tank. You'll find rust in 
there too, probably, and inside the tank. Time to seal the inside of the 
tank, which means you have to disassemble it (remove filler neck, sending 
unit, nipples, etc). Of course, the etcher you need to use first will 
ruin the paint on the outside when you spill it, so you need to repaint 
the tank, too.

See what I mean? I think I'm seriously afflicted with this "while you're 
in there" disease.
