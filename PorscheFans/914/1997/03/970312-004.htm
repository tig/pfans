Mike-

Jack the car up and support with jack stands. Remove the wheel. Remove the
top nut that holds the shock shaft into the body.  If the shock shaft spins
when you try to remove the nut, hold the big washer under the nut with a
pair of channel locks.  This washer has a "tooth" on it that fits in a notch
on the shock shaft. Reach in the wheel well and grab the upper dust shield
on your strut..pull down.  This will pull the shock shaft out of the body
and allow you to compress the strut.  You should be able to compress it
enough to tilt the whole assembly past the fender lip and remove the dust
cover.  Make sure you don't put your brake line in a bind.  Your strut inser
is held into the strut tube with a screw on cap, you'll probably see a
couple threads showing.  Remove this cap by means of a pipe wrench or big
set of channel locks.  You may have to wail on it a bit, watch the brake
line.  You can block the strut housing against the fender well with a piece
of 2x4 if you need to. Once you have it unscrewed, remove the old insert.
Check for oil/water in the strut tube...you can soak it up with paper
towels.  Insert your new Koni.  If you are going to be doing some track
events you may want to get a 50/50 mix of water and antifreeze.  Put a
little in the strut tube (it won't take much because the insert will
displace most of the room in the housing).  You want to have the
antifreeze/water solution come up about half way on your insert.  This
solution will help with heat dissipation on your shock.  Don't use just
plain water as it will freeze and collapse your insert.  Install the new
screw on cap that Koni supplied you.  I like to use a little blue loctite on
the cap to keep it from backing off.  Wail on it to tighten. Install the new
bump rubber Koni supplied you.  If your car has been lowered you can shorten
the bump rubber, but always, always run a bump rubber.  Reinstall the dust
shield and aim the piston rod back up through the body.  Install the top nut
and there you go! You may also want to check our everday Koni prices next
time.  Check our ads in Pano and Excellence.  Thanks
