As a follow up to my question about wheel stud length the question of lug
nut types came up.  I've read just enough to be dangerous.

I've got the 5 lug 911 5 spoke (Fuch?) type wheels (have 911 part number so
assume not a reproduction) on my 914.  I've seen  steel lug nuts and alloy
lug nuts listed in catalogs.  Right now I have steel lug nuts on the 4 to 5
lug wheel adapter studs.  Once I get rid of the adapters and converted to 5
lug hubs and studded front rotor what type lug nut should I have?

Should I have alloy nuts for alloy wheels or does it matter?
If keep and reuse steel nuts I have, anything I should do when using them
with alloy rims?
Any torque variations with alloy/alloy or steel/alloy?

Appreciate any info on the steel/alloy issue.

Second issue, wheel locks.  Once I get converted I think I'll have 45mm
studs front and rear,  this leaves about 9 threads exposed for the lug nut.
I recall seeing a tech note in one of the catalogs that this was the
minimum number of threads/turns for lug nuts to be safe.  What type/brand
of wheel lock nuts will work with this combo/stud length?
