	Hmm...  Well, if you did as Mike Nugent speculated, and put
the cooler up high (right by the vent holes), then the likelihood of
a rock getting that high is probably pretty small.  Especially if it
has to go through some heavy-duty mesh first.
	But I agree that you could have some real visibility probs
if you ever did get a hole in it.

	On oil cooler location, one of the Renegade Club guys (Rich?)
has mentioned a fan-forced cooler either in the rear fender or by the
transmission.  It's not the greatest location, being warm to start
with and debris-prone, but he says that it cools the car pretty effec-
tively, and that with a mesh cover it has lasted three or four people
a total of about five years (I think it was) with no damage.
	I may be wrong on the details; check the Renegade Forum for
his posts.  Check out:  http://www.dgi.net/914  I think the particular
posts may be in the "Modification" section, but I'm not sure.
