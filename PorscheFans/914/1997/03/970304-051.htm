Hi 914-er's!

  I need to get a question answered.  In reply to Ray, George Hussey writes:

  Now, what George says here is exactly the way that I was taught to adjust
clutch pedal free-play, and it makes perfect sense.  You want a small gap
between the release bearing and the diaphram fingers to ensure that the
clutch is fully engaged and that the release bearing is not turning
unnecessarily.   

   Only.....  in my '74 914 2.0 litre,  there is a spring on the pedal
assembly that makes this impossible;  the adjustment has to be exactly
backwards.  The spring holds the clutch pedal down by the 3/4 inch or so of
free play, ensuring that there is ALWAYS some pressure on the release
bearing.  To check the free play, I have to grab the pedal and pull it UP,
or backwards against this spring;  I have mine adjusted so that it moves
about 3/4 - 1".  I was told by a friend of mine that he vaguely remembers
something similar from VW Beetles, and I can see a rationale for it in the
914:  The slight tension on the cable (it's not a very big spring) ensures
that the cable won't pop off the nylon roller on the side of the gearbox.
  The problem is that this is backwards from normal practice, and now, it's
backwards from what Dr914 just said, and that worries me a bit.  Still, I
don't see how it could be otherwise; the spring is so shaped that it could
not possibly be fitted so that it moves the pedal in the up direction, and
based on it's appearance, has been in it's present position forever.

   Anyone have any comments on this?  Am I doing OK, or do I have something
assembled very wrong?  Any comments / suggestions would be appreciated.

					Thanks,
					Jim T.
