Rick.....It's not necessary to replace your existing lower A-arms and torsion
bars to convert to a SC strut.  You will need to upgrade your early style
ball joints to the "Wedge pin" styles used on later 914s.  This is a direct
replacement and requires no modification.
There are also a couple of other considerations when contemplating this
conversion.  The 911s early vented rotor Boge struts setups were commonly
found on cars going back to the early '70s.  These sets use the ATE "M" style
calipers, aluminum hubs, 20mm vented rotors and are very similar in strut
tube design to your 914s Boges.  Although this 911 Boges spindles and hub
setup are different the strut tubes will match your existing 914s.  This
means you can transfer your existing strut inserts into these early units.
 The early 911 Boge struts sets are also much cheaper than the later SC Boge
or SC Bilstein struts.  Typically $150.00 to $300.00 a set.  The trade off in
choosing early vs late sturts is the SC uses a slightly larger ATE caliper.
   Lastly is the choice between the SC Boge or Bilstein strut.  In choosing
these later style Boge (as is with the early Boge) you will find many choices
for inserts.  These Boge struts will accept Koni, Boge, Bilstein, KYB and
several lesser brands of inserts where the Green Bilstein struts can only use
the Bilstein inssert without extensive modification.  One advantage the
Bilstein has is it lends itself to spindle raising (symetrical full lenght
strut tube) much easier than either of the Boge struts (fluted strut tube
just above the spindle collar).  This is important most often to racers who
are lowering their cars extensively and want to correct the increased bump
steer problem created when changeing the steering rack/tie rod relationship
to the Pitman arm on the strut.   
For a street 914 I like the Boge (early or late styles) strut with the
adjustable gas Koni "Red" insert.  This is a tuneable insert that is easily
adjusted after it is in the car.  It allows increased or decreased rebound
tuning with the simple turn of an knob located at the top of the strut.
 Paragon Products (800-200-9366) is a very competatively priced stocking Koni
distributor and they are also very knowledgeable when it comes to the entire
Koni line of products.
Good luck with the conversion.  I think you will like the change.
