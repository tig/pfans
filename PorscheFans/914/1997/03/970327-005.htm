I have the same engine in my car.  When I did my rebuild, I put the new 
big bore kit on, had the rods balanced, had the crank/flywheel/impeller
balanced,
new bearings, the melling oil pump, new valve springs, keepers and
guides, and
installed a modified FI cam from FAT performance.

>From input from this list in its prior incarnation (when Stan Hanks ran
it) I
also installed new 2.0L injectors (they are green instead of yellow) to
help
with the enrichment for the new displacement and compression ratio (the
NPR
kit bumps you about to somewhere between 8.5/9.5:1).

I'm still in the process of tuning the FI since I only have about 400
miles 
on the rebuild (it still hunts at idle and runs a bit lean).  I figure I
have
a good base to work from and you can (if you have the proper measurement 
equipment [CO meter]) tune the D-jet quite easily.

Adjustments can be made to fuel pressure, the MP-sensor and the head
temp
sensor to "tune" the FI for your particular engine.  It's basically
trial
and error until you get the car running how you want.  There is lots of 
info about tuning your FI at:

	http://www.estinc.com/porsche/techref.html

There are a few good books as well: 

	"How to Tune and Modify Bosch Fuel Injection"; and
        "Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management"

which both cover the D-Jet as well as the more modern FI systems.
