Found this from Jan. '96.  I was being a bit silly with Andrew Kalman's 
PhD.

    "The ports are so located merely as the result of evolution in a    
     changing world."   How's that for a psych explanation?

Since nobody else has replied to the group; and although I have had 
little formal training in either behavoral psychology or internal 
combustion propulsion, I offer the following intuitive perspectives:

A vacuum is created when a fluid (air in this case) flows past an  
opening that is oriented perpendicular to the flow.  The amount of 
vacuum created is propotional to the velocity of the flow.  

There are three realities with ignition in gas engines that will be 
discussed here:

Reality 1:  Ignition must occur near or after TDC (Top Dead Center) 
while at very low rpm, as in cranking to start.  Many an arm has been 
broken by trying to crank with spark in advance of TDC.  Electric 
starters don't like it much, either.

Reality 2:  For optimum power and efficiency, engines need spark to 
occur well in advance of TDC while running.  This is a fixed value of 
about 27-30 degrees in light aircraft engines, which are one 
evolutionary ancestor of Porsche engines.  The ideal spark advance 
varies with rpm and load.  Up to at least 1935, cars had a manual spark 
advance control in the cockpit.  More modern cars with mechanical 
distributors use centrifugal counter weights to increase advance, 
usually maxing out at about 3,000 rpm.  That is why the 914 timing is 
calibrated to 27 degrees BTDC at 3500 rpm, with vacuum advance removed.

There is many a time I have wished for a manual spark advance control 
in the cockpit of my '73 914 with its high compression and propensity 
for pre-ignition knock at high rpm.  Next time I get my hands on that 
car, I will try colder plugs.  But, I sort of digress here, detonation 
and pre-ignition are a related topic, however..

Vacuum advance is in series with centrifugal advance in cars of the 
vintage of the 914.  One sure sign of an early (pre-'54?) VW engine is 
the lack of a vacuum advance.  It was back in my Corvair years that I 
last measured vacuum advance, so I need to refresh that knowledge.  
To be continued..

Reality 3:  Idling engines pollute less if the spark is retarded well 
after TDC.  That is the function of vacuum retard on the 914.  The port 
is located such that full manifold vacuum is applied, but only when the 
throttle is fully closed.  

I have a vacuum gauge mounted under the dash of my '76 914, so I will 
be taking some measurements to complete this project...

    Wondering if my writings reveal a residual psychosis.
