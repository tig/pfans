While putting my nice new vacuum hoses on my 75 2.0l tonight, I was a
little baffled over one of the lines.  With Dave Darling's colored diagram
in front of me, I tried to figure out where all the hoses are supposed to
go.  All conquered except one, the little short 7" line which goes from the
distributor vacuum to what looks like the throttle body.   It looks like
two lines run this route; one from the back of the distributor to the back
of the throttle body (I figured that one out), but I can't figure where to
connect the line on top of the distributor vacuum.  I don't have anymore
vacuum stubs coming out of the throttle body.  All of the diagrams I've
found  show two stubs coming off of the throttle body, almost opposite each
other, I have one.

Is there something special on the later model throttle bodies which I'm not
getting?  Where does this line go!!!

Sorry if I sound rushed, but my employer decided to send me to Boston for
the next 5 weeks for software training, which doesn't leave me much time to
get this car back together for my targeted April autocross.  :(

I've also read that I don't need to hook up the decel valve.  If not, why
not and what do I do with the openings left by the missing vacuum hoses?

As always, any help is appreciated.

Dion
