Michael, the early rotors will not fit the late model struts as early and
late are totally different. This change was made in late 1972(from chassis
number 4722919033) and was done to fit thicker pads, an improved balljoint,
and the rotor centering circle for more precise tire balance.
    By the way Michael, we have had some problems recently with a fast but
haphazard shipper.  Some people did not receive a part and others an extra
one.  Shipping over 150 packages per day, the kid cracked under pressure.
Hopefully though, we have solved the problem, so I apologize to everyone
who may have experienced a shipping error. When errors rise to 1%, we have
a problem!(1% is really a lot)
