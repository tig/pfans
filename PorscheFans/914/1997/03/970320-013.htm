I have an 3 qt. Accusump in my PCA 914-4 2.0 TT racer. On the "skidpad" at
Buttonwillow, on a long (time-wise) left turn/circle, I can watch the oil
pressure drop as I continue to go round and round.  What I'm seeing is the
Accusump dumping its pressurized oil into the motor, all 3 qts worth,
because the oil pump is starving.  I don't recall exactly, but after
"hooking up" on the circle, I got maybe 1.5-2 complete revolutions before I
straightened out because the oil pressure had dropped from 60+ psi to 25 or
so, at 2000 rpm (oil was cold).

I did this previously without an Accusump, and without a big red warning
light, and without paying attention to my oil pressure gauge (it's where
the radio used to be), and with that pathetic stock 914-4 oil pressure
idiot light, and the result was that I lost that motor before I ever got on
the racetrack.  It was not a good weekend.

So, to put it mildly, the Accusump does work, and it works nicely.  

The unpleasant thing about the Accusump is dealing with its valve.  My
Accusump is mounted in the front trunk, along with a C/M oil filter, an oil
thermostat, and a fan-driven oil cooler.  I was able to make a special pull
cable that comes  out of the dash, so I can open and close the Accusump
while belted in place.  

Note that I can completely pressurize the system (oil at 60+ psi) prior to
starting -- this motor _never_ (unless I get out of my routine) sees 0 psi
oil pressure, not even at starting.  

I don't see the logic in using the electric valve C/M offers for the
Accusump, because you still end up starting the motor with no oil pressure,
since the valve energizes at the same instant that the starter starts
turning, and in my experience 914/4 motors start up almost instantly.
However, getting a pull cable to work with the manual valve is not trivial,
so if you can live with a second or two of 0 oil pressure when starting,
then I'd choose the electric solenoid valve.

Racer Wholoesale, Pegasus, etc. sell Accusumps, and they're not too expensive.

You can drain the unit, as long as gravity can take the oil out of it.

If you add external cooling, I would suggest trying to mount it as close to
the engine as possible -- this probably means putting the Accusump in the
rear trunk, and putting the oil cooler at the rear lip of the trunk,
directly in the airstream. This would keep the length of the required oil
lines to a minimum, and concentrate the weight towards the center of the
car.

I would suggest trying the Weltmeister oil "trap" first, and if that's not
good enough, then use the Accusump.

HTH,
