Jeff:

The most important consideration is whether you'll be racing your 
car.  If you will, your sanctioning body will REQUIRE steel lug nuts 
with some number of exposed threads.  I don't know whether your local 
PCA time-trial or "driver's-ed" events require steel lug nuts, of 
course, but you should DEFINITELY find out before shortening your 
studs so far that you can't get the minimum exposed thread-length.

Now that that's out of the way...

Your steel lug nuts will work fine with alloy wheels, but you MUST 
coat the FACE of the nut with anti-seize to keep it from galling on 
the alloy wheel.

As I recall (it's been a long time since I've used my alloy lug
nuts), torque specs for the two types of lug nuts are just about
identical.

Ok... Wheel locks:

I know of three types of wheel locks that'll fit:

    1.  The two-part locks comprised of a lens-shaped face that you
        tighten onto the stud with a special tool and an alloy "cap"
        that screws down over it so the whole assembly looks sorta
        like a stock alloy lug nut.  These SUCK; the pins on the   
        tightening tool aren't very strong and they invariably fall
        out or break off.  On top of that, the tightening tool is   
        made up of two pieces... One more thing to lose.

    2.  The McGard locks.  Again, these come in two pieces, although
        one piece is purely cosmetic.  The "key" is a one-piece
        internal-wrenching socket.  These are ok, I guess, but I
        still don't like the idea of a two-piece lock.

    3.  The kind I took off my 914/6 when I went to steel nuts.
        Unfortunately, I can't remember what they're called.  They
        work like the McGard locks, but they're just one piece; they
        don't need the cosmetic "caps" that the McGard locks come
        with.

I'll find out who made my wheel locks and let you know.
