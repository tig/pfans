Well I'm don't claim to be an aircraft engine guru. But a good friend of
mine used to own/fly/service a Piper Colt with a lycoming 4 cylinder
engine that put out 150HP at 2000rpm. Now just in case you think this is
not too diferent from a 'teener motor, this motor displaced 302 cubic
inches, that's 5 liters! That's _alot_ bigger than any four banger I've
ever seen in a car. I saw one of those pistons on his desk, it was huge.
I doubt that the valves from that motor would _ever_ fit a porsche head.
But there is something that might be adaptable from aircraft technology.
Fine-wire plugs. This takes the concept of multi-cathode plugs to a
whole new level. The anode of the plug is at the edge of the plug and a
wire stretches across the face of the plug, the wire is the cathode.
These plugs prevent fouling compeltely, and my friend said he noticed a
significant difference between these plugs and brand new standard plugs.
This test is done in the following way:  

First off, all of these engines are twin-plug design. And each set of
plugs run off an independent magneteto. During run up on the taxi way,
one switches off one magneto at a time to make sure both are working. If
the motor dies during this test, it proves that the one which was
supposed to be on is broken. The way you tell if one is stronger than


the other is that even during run up, the prop is putting a load on the
engine, and you can measure power directly from the rpms the engine
turns at a given throttle setting. More revs, more power. He had only
one set of fine-wire plugs in his motor for this test and the other set
were standard aircraft plugs.

Unfortunately, these fine-wire plugs cost $45 each. Not exactly a cheap
fix.
