This cryo process is the same thing I had presented to the list regarding 
engine components.  Many motorsport teams are using the process to help 
prevent part failure. If you want more info on the processs and what it will 
cost check out the following web site.   http://www.tecsolv.com/cryo/

OK, I'll try and give a brief history and theory.

The cold quenching process was first dabbled in during WWII (some say the
proces goes back to the '30s), then abandoned until the 60's. GM did some
experimental work on engine parts, but it is mostly used now for high
carbon steel tool bits. There's a professor in Louisiana that's an expert
in this area, can't recall his name right now. I got interested when the
Snap-On ctalog mentioned that thier screwdriver tips were dipped in LN2. 

The slow cryogenic quench does several things to materials. First, if 
it's steel, any remaining austenite is precipitated into martensite, and 
the crystaline structure is changed from cubical to a rectangular prisim 
(according to an article I read in a motorcycle mag), thus making it 
stronger (and tougher). Second, the part undergoes a deep stress relief, 
and the grain of the material becomes finer. The most dramtic results are 
obtained with high carbon tool steels, where wear resistance is often 
increased 5-8 times. Plain carbon steel increases by 2 times. The process 
alters the material all of the way through the part, not just on the 
surface. See "Cryogenics", August 1982, p 409, among others.  For irons 
and aluminums, the advantages of deep stress relief and a finer grain are 
found to be the main advantages. CryoPro claims that treated golf balls 
go 40yards farther (about 12$/doz), and panty hose last 6 months (O 
Boy!). 

Generally, the current process takes the parts down to about -100 with 
a regular refrigerator, then a LN2 mist is used to take the parts the 
rest of the way down to -300degF. This takes about a day. Then the part 
is held there for about a day, then brought back up over another day. The 
parts aren't plunged into the LN2 anymore like they used to be. They use 
a computer to control the whole process, too.

Many different racers use this on thier parts. Everyone from motorcycle 
drag bikes to NASCAR people chill thier parts. You can bet F1 people do 
it too. CryoPro has a web page if you want more info and a price sheet.
