That's the way I'm doing it.  By putting a 75 2.0 liter in my 72 chassis, it 
takes me from a half way decent, street prepared SCCA autocross class, straight 
to AP this year.   And yes, at my local club I will run up against a few 
trailered fire breathers.  But I don't car, because I have a 2 year plan for the 
car which includes learning how to DRIVE it first, then worry about the 8 inch 
wheels, roll cage, Haltech FI, etc.

But hey, I'm going to have a blast!  And in my opinion (about .02 worth), my 914 
looks a heck of a lot better going around the cones in any class than a late 
model muscle car.
