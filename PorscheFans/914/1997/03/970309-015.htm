Jeff,

This sounds to me like the smog-control air pump added to the 75 and 76 engines.  
It works by pumping air down into your heads entering where the exhaust valve 
lets out its gasses.  This adds fresh air to the exhaust helping it pass 
emmisions.  The little pump on top should be running hoses to your heads where 4 
hollow bolts enter the heads just to the right and left of the intake runners.

Since I never plan on having my car tested for emissions control, I took the 
entire assembly off of the engine.

I hope this helps.  By the way, I'm opporating off of my alternate sign-on in 
this message while I'm working in Boston for the next 4 weeks.  I can't always 
wait till I get home on the weekends to get my PorscheFans E-mail!

Dion
