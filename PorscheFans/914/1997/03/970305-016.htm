	As you may have guessed, I've been mucking about with my front
suspension recently.  One thing that I've noticed is that, on the left
(driver's) side, the inner end of my tie rod is not vertical.
	If that doesn't make sense, picture this:  The inner end of the
tie rod is kina fork-shaped, and goes around an "eye" with a bushing in
it.  There's a bolt through the sides of the fork that passes through
the hole in the eye.  Coming off the side of the eye is a shaft that
evidently screws into the end of the steering rack.
	The bolt through the eye is, I think, supposed to be horizontal.
The slot in the fork would be vertical.  This is the case on the right
side of my car, but the left is off by about 45 degrees.
	Can I just unfasten things, screw the eye-piece in all the way
(or to wherever it gets the right orientation) and then mess with the
toe until it's right?  Do I need a locknut of some sort on the shaft-end
of the eye-piece?  (There might be one that I didn't notice, but I can't
find it on the exploded diagram in the manual.)
	I'd appreciate any insight on this.
