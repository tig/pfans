Jay,

Okay I can help you on both accounts the 914-6 and 914 community does not
really care, as long as you do not pass it off as a real 6, we convert 4
into 6 and usually make it better than  the original, but then we
understand that it is a conversion, and most 914-6 conversion can be
converted back.  Now the information is really available about the
conversion and lots of people have done it or are doing it.  I am, but I
have an original 914-6 with in arms reach and now a converted 914-4, into
a 6.  They made imported a little less than 1600 of these original "6s",
my number is from memory.  Yes I need to bone up before the next tech
quiz.  Most people are not lucky enough to be able to own an original,
and it is now a big no no to cut one up and make a race car so most of us
convert a 4.

BTW, I have a friend in Dayton, that has done allot of Sunbeam to Tiger
conversions.  he has done them for years, and he told me a couple years
ago that it was now a no no.  But he continues to do them because
customers want them done.  He goes to all the steps to convert them
including welding up holes and re drilling them because that was the way
it was done.   He also works on restoring sunbeams and Tigers, does a
great job at it.

Remember I have no problem with doing it as long as it is not
misrepresented as being the real thing.  I do have a problem if the
person tries to pass it off as the real thing, and the Serial numbers are
not correct or the details are wrong.  I remember seeing a Concurs judges
car at the Cincinnati Parade that had a license plate that said "REAL 6",
when it was a 74 chassis.  Key switch was on the column, it had the
sliding passenger seat, and a set of black center gauges, yep makes it a
74.  Or  a 75-76 with converted bumpers.  Remember a set of emblems does
not make a true car only a proper serial number makes it a real 914-6.

BTW, I have even considered rebodying a real "6" because it was to far
gone to repair.  And it could be considered a valid way of doing it.  If
you look close enough, you can find a P/N for a stripped chassis to build
a race car from in the "GT" catalog, so since I could have gone to
Stoddard and ordered a tub, what is the difference. But only if you
convert everything over to "6" spec and transfer the serial numbers.  And
even then I would have to tell the next buyer that it was a rebody, but
that is me.  But then I would never sell a real "6" so it would be a moot
point.

This question gets raised in every area of motorcars.  BMW, people will
not like it if you build a 318i and make it an M3 if you represent it as
a real M3.  And a Cobra person will get a little peezed if you take an AC
Ace and convert it and try to pass it off as a Cobra even a 289.  As long
as you do not miss represent a car, you can do what ever you wish, but if
you take a Fiero and build a 512BB clone, well you better not try to sell
it as a real 512BB.  I feel it is an ethics issue, but then there will be
come a day when somebody will get up in arms because all of us have
converted a "4" to a "6", go figure.  

Remember you are entitled to do what you want with your own car, and you
will find somebody that will always disagree with you.

Take Care,
