P-Fans, 

 While just out of high school ('83) and driving around in my  914-6, I
had a friend who worked on Porsche's and he had a customer that had a
rusted/crashed 914-6 and a nice 914-4 shell, As I watched over the next
few months the took every item off the 914-6, EVERYTHING and put them on
the 914-4. They even cut out the complete inner fender well and welded
it back in, the car was outstanding when done and I really doubt Anyone
could have told, I dont know if the owner intended to pass it off as a
real six though , Im sure he did.
BTW the car was in Southen Califrnia in '85, painted white and back then
have a personal plate that read BAD 6/BAD SIX or something just like
that. Anyone know the car ??

Yes, I think what was done was wrong !! But it was for me to say back
then, Plus the guy who owned the car carried a gun/badge for a living in
you know what I mean.

 Don
