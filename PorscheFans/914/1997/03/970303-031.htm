HELP!  I just replaced the front suspension bushings, ball joints, A-arms, 
steering rack spacers (my car is about 1 inch lower than stock), and 
installed turbo tie-rods on my 74 2.0.  I have 4 brand-new Yokohama A509's 
(195/60/15 on Fuchs), and my KYB shocks are only 1 year old.  I just had the 
car alligned at NTW and everything is well within their specs for the car.

Problem:  The car no longer has any "on-center" feel (ie. the steering wheel 
doesn't have any inclination to stay centered).  If I'm driving on a nice, 
smooth street and I twitch the steering wheel left or right, the wheel stays 
turned that direction.  Any other car I've ever driven tends to want to go 
straight in the direction it is pointed while mine now prefers to maintain 
any steering input I provide.  This makes driving on the highway a 2-handed, 
concentration intense experience because the car wants to dart around 
constantly.  Prior to the affore-mentioned work, the car did not exhibit 
this behavior and would track nice and straight by itself.

I replaced the tires and front suspension at the same time so I can't 
attribute this new behavior to one or the other.  Any advice or input on 
what your 914's do would be greatly appreciated.  Anyone else running 509's? 
 Please HELP ME!!

Mike g.
