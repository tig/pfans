Don:

You don't have to spend $750 (and you certainly don't have to "bug
the hell out of" anyone) to solve this problem... Just call North
Hollywood Speedometer and tell them to:

    1.  Replace the brake warning light in the upper quadrant of
        your stock combo gauge with a calibrated, numbered
        oil-temperature gauge.

    2.  Replace your tach with one from a 911 Turbo.  Recalibrate the
        boost gauge (located just below the center of the tach) for
        oil pressure, then silkscreen oil-pressure numbering around
        it.

North Hollywood did my gauges as described above... They look 
fantastic and, personally, I REALLY like having the oil-pressure 
gauge right there in the middle of the tach where I can see it, 
rather than off in a corner of the combo gauge.

Total cost?  A couple hundred dollars, much of which you'd have to
spend anyway to recalibrate and re-silkscreen your tach for the
six-cylinder conversion.
