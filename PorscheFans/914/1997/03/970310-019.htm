Well JJ, in an ideal world this would be the way to do it. An ideal
world has a lift in it, one you can use. If you don't have a lift, it
will very hard to get the car high enough for the engine to clear a
dolly that was high enough to support the engine in the car. The
multiple times that Dave Darling and I have pulled engines, we have
found that the engine resting on a floor jack and the car jacked up as
high as we can get it, leaves about 1" of clearance for the highest
point on the engine. And this is _after_ alot of the things that stick
up on the engine have been removed. Basically, everything above the air
dist box. This includes the throttle body, the oil filler neck, and the
dipstick too.

If however, you have a lift, drop the engine onto a table with wheels
and lift the car off of it. Good luck! Don't worry, with practice,
this'll become easy.:)
From scratch, I can have the engine and tranny out in just about an
hour. And that's without a lift.
