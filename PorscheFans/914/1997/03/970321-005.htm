Hi JJ.

Well, this is what worked for me ...

I applied Eastwood's Citrus-based _paint_remover_ to the piston tops (it's
halfway between a liquid and a gel), and let it sit a day or two.  Then I
sprayed the resultant mush with Carburator cleaner, and it just washed
away. It was really amazing to see the carbon just dissolve, but you have
to be patient.

This was a couple of years ago, on a BMW big-six while I had the head off. 
I did my best to prevent the little carbon particles from flowing off the
edge of the piston and down towards the rings.  This engine has now done
another 45,000 miles and continues to be smoke-free, etc. so it looks like
no harm was done.
