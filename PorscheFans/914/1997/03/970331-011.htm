I'm not the only sufferer???  I feel much better now <grin>.

I've got my $2000 project sitting in back yard, about that same amount in
parts I want to replace sitting in boxes, trying to decide where to begin.

Course first I have to finish the storage shed behind garage, so I can get
all the spare car parts and stuff out of the garage so I can actually work
in there.  Figured I'd do something simple yesterday and put on the
slightly smaller steering wheel I have (I'm 6'4" and knee comes right
between stock wheel and shifter). I'd found the even smaller wheel I have
from another parts car and the Forza adapter in one of the boxes, figured
out the adapter fits the wheel I want to use.  Swap wheels should take
about 1/2 hour I figure.

Well right now the steering wheels are still sitting in the car and I have
the steering column turn signal/washer switch cluster out so I can clean
that up and check connections and lube it, and fix the horn,   "while I'm
in there".

And lurking in some of the boxes are a 19mm master cylinder, bump steer
kit, SS brake lines, pedal cluster bronze bushing kit, have some 320i
calipers to get rebuilt and machined, and on and on and on....

Might be quicker to build a time machine and go back and buy a new 914  ;-)

Yes, you should refinish and rebuild your pedal cluster. But, be aware that
this is what lead me to take most of my car apart! I went gonzo on the
cluster - completely disassenble it, get parts blasted, then zinc chromate
plated, then reassemble with bronze bushings, then cold galvanize painted,
then painted black. It sure looks nice sitting on the shelf in my storage
facility.

If you have the money, and it's legal in your class, do the BMW 320i
brake upgrade while you have the system apart.

Rack spacers are easier to do with the master cylinder out of the way, too.

Once you have the pedal cluster out, sand off the rust on the floor, and
get a sharp heavy duty scraper and hammer off the bituminus insulation
because you'll find rust under it for sure. Refinish the floor. Also, the
floor of the shifter tunnel will most likely be rusty, too, so it's good
time to refinish that. Also, it's much easier to replace the fuel lines
in the shifter tunnel with the cluster out, if you need to do that.
Finally, unless the two supply tubes to the master cylinder come off of it
easily, then you're going to have to pull the tank. You'll find rust in
there too, probably, and inside the tank. Time to seal the inside of the
tank, which means you have to disassemble it (remove filler neck, sending
unit, nipples, etc). Of course, the etcher you need to use first will
ruin the paint on the outside when you spill it, so you need to repaint the
tank, too.

See what I mean? I think I'm seriously afflicted with this "while you're in
there" disease.
