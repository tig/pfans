In addition to my Porsche, I also have a Sunbeam Alpine (and my dad has a 
Sunbeam Tiger).  Right now there is a raging war going on in the Sunbeam 
Tiger e-mail group about using Alpine body parts to preserve Tigers.  I 
was wondering what the Porsche community thinks about using 914 parts to 
preserve 914-6's.

Here is a little bit about the debate.  There is this group of about 6 
guys who have compiled this private list of minute differences between 
Tigers and Alpines (other than the obvious engine/trans/rear).  They will 
not tell anyone what is on the list because they do not want to provide a 
checklist for people to convert Alpines into fake Tigers.  But, for a 
nominal fee, they will come to you and inspect your Tiger to see if it is 
real.  They look for certain welds, shapes of certain bumps in the 
firewall, holes in the right places, etc.  

So, my thought was to see if there is any sort of corresponding group in 
the Porsche 914 world.  Or, are each and every factory difference between 
914's and 914-6's readily available?  And if so, how do people tell if 
they have a real 914-6 or a 914 that has had a dead 914-6's VIN pop 
riveted on and many if not all of the changes made.

Maybe it doesn't mean much to Porsche folks.  But, these Tiger folks sure 
are scared of Alpines and Tiger fakes.  Personally, I do not see why it 
matters if someone has gone to the effort of using an Alpine body shell to 
bring a Tiger back to life that otherwise would be off to the scrap yard - 
that's all the Sunbeam people did!

Thanks for any responses.  Oh, for some reason, I have not been getting 
the digest lately.  So, if you have a response, please send it to me 
directly.
