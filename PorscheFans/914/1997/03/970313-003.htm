Need the list's accumulated wisdom on what I should do with this.

Right now my car has 5 lug 911 alloys on it, using 4-5lug wheel adapters(
curtesy of PO)  which I want to get rid of.  I have a set of used parts I
picked up that I will use to replace the adapters, just started cleaning
them up. Have a 5 lug converted rear hub and rotor, and a 5 lug converted
front rotor. (also have new bearing that I'll be using with these)

The rear hub stud length is just right, I will be able to use the sealed
end lug nuts I have now.

On the front rotor the stud length is extra long.  So my options seem to
be:

Have the stud's cut shorter.  Is this even possible? While installed in the
rotor? Will it affect hardness?

Use some spacers. I assume this may have been done by PO. I could do this
though not sure I like idea of spacers, I'm trying to get rid of adapters
now since don't like stuff between wheel and rotor.

Get some open end lug nuts.  This would work but wouldn't match the rears.


Any comments on any of these options? Any I've overlooked?

Thanks for any help
