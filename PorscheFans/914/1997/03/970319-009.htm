Hi Joshua,

Hmmm....thanks for the feedback.  I guess the guys I talked to
like the "feel" of toe IN for street/autox.  As for the camber settings,
I forgot to mention we were talking about BFG tires.

Good point about the rear toe....I'd rather the shop screw up on
the side of caution (and safety!!!) with toe IN rather than toe OUT.

I haven't been able to autox my 914 yet due to a variety of reasons,
one of which is that the shop that did my alignment really
screwed it up....(well, the 3.0 conversion isn't totally sorted
out yet either....)

How does -2.9 degrees camber on the front left and -1.5 degrees
camber on the front right sound?

That's what my careful measurements produced while trying
to figure out why my car sways like a pendulum at around
60mph.  Oh yeah....this shop has a "super-accurate computer"
to perform these alignments.  :-(

Thanks for the rest of your thoughtful feedback, Joshua.
