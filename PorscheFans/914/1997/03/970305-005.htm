    Ken:

    I use it in my NSX, but not in the 914... And you shouldn't be
    using it in your 914, either.

    MTL has the viscosity of a 30-weight motor oil, so it works great
    in transmissions designed for those very lightweight oils. It
    will NOT adequately protect the gears in your 901 transmission.

    The proper Redline gear oil for you (if you have an open
    differential, anyway), is 75W90.  PLEASE go buy some and replace
    the MTL with it... Your transmission will thank you.

    -Andy

    P.S.  You don't have to take my word for this, by the way... Call 
          Redline at 707 745-6100 and they'll tell you.
