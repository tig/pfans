Hi  J.J.  !

  I, too, have been on the phone with Bill of mark Stephens High
Performance about head work,
amoung other things.

  Concerning what you wrote:

 I got the same story, although not in as much detail as you did. 
Basically, he did say that newer valve
technology had surpassed that in use at the time  the engine was built, and
that the sodium valves
were a bandaid approach to a problem that has been fixed with newer
metallurgy.  He also mentioned
something about heat transfer through the valve seat, which bothered me a
little bit, as I will explain.
  However, if you are sure that you are representing his remarks exactly, I
have a problem with what he
said to you.  Basically, the mechanism for heat transfer in a sodium filled
valve is that heat absorbed into the head
at the top and on the seating surface is conducted into the interior of the
valve.  Sodium is present in a 
hollow cavity inside the valve, which runs most of the way up the stem. 
The sodium melts and circulates
around inside the valve, from the head to the stem and back again.  
  Now, according to my CRC Handbook  of Chemistry and Physics, the specific
heat of sodium is .293, which
ranks it about 5 out of 92 elements in it's ability to absorb heat. 
(Specific heat is the amount of heat required
to raise the temperature of 1 gram of a substance 1 degree centigrade, in
small calories... water is 1.)
  This large specific heat means that the sodium is a good coolant, as is
water.  The circulating sodium picks 
up heat from the hottest part of the valve (the head) and transfers it
efficiently to the stem, where it is
transfered to the valve guide by conduction, and thence to the head casting
itself, and finally to the cooling air.
  A solid valve can dissipate heat only by conduction up the valve stem
through the steel, and unless it's made of
 some material that wouldn't last 5 seconds as an exhaust valve, that is a
pretty poor heat transfer mechanism.
The only other route is through the seat by contact with it when the valve
is closed.  But remember, the valve isn't closed all the time, and the seat
is also heated by the flow of hot exhaust gasses over it.  Depending on
conduction
of heat through the valve seat would require some phenomenonal strides in
metallurgy;  you might check with someone who knows the field, but as I
recall, stainless steel is an even poorer conductor of heat than ordinary
steel.    This means that the seating surface might run a bit cooler,
assuming the new whiz-bang seats are REALLY efficient
at transfering heat to the head itself, but the valve proper will be even
hotter.
  My understanding of the failure mechanism is that the metal of the valve
stem just below the head gets
so hot that it looses it's heat-treated hardness.  It then becomes
malleable, and begins to stretch.  As
it stretches, it of course gets thinner, which means weaker, and eventually
the head seperates from the
stem with catastrophic results.  
  All of which is not to say that sodium-filled valves are immune to this
process; but my guess is that it
would take them a lot longer to develop the failure mode.

  When I spoke to Bill at Mark Stephens, I twisted his arm a bit and got
him to agree to machine up my
sodium valves and install them with his new seats.  I have not sent him my
heads yet, for reasons which I will
go into  in another E-mail if you wish, but I would recommend that you try
to do the same.  The only way that
I would substitute is if I could get him to warranty the whole engine
against a broken valve for the same
length of time that he will warranty his seats, which I doubt that he is
willing to do.

  If you do decide to go that route, however, I would be interested in your
sodium valves as spares.

  I just went out to the garage and eye-balled a 10 mm bolt against the
existing studs in my heads.  When I
first read the above, I thought that there might not be much "meat" left on
the head for the new studs to
screw into, but upon looking at the area, I think that you'll be all right.
 It is surely worth a try, if the 
alternative is $200!

  Just two things:  I believe that it was Tom Wilson who said in his book
that one should watch for any
exhaust valve that is continually tightening up in adjustment.  If you get
one, shorten the adjustment interval,
and if you get large changes on 2 or 3 successive adjustments, park the car
until you can replace the valves.
It means one is getting ready to lose it's head.  Keep a close eye on this,
regardless of which type of
valves you opt to go with.  The second is:  torque those exhaust fasteners
with a known accurate
torque wrench, and don't over-do it!  There is no torque spec published in
the Haynes book, but I
got a friendly type at Automotion to look it up for me, and it is 13 -15
ft*lbs.  

				
							Good Luck!
