There is another failure mode besides the stem nearest the head of the
valve stretching which is the edge of the head of the valve cracking
leading to a loss of compression. The sodium is there to transfer heat
from the face and edge of the valve to the cooler stem, where it can be
transfered through the guide into the head, as you state. 

Stainless steel has less tensile strength than the carbon steel that
regular valves are made of, unless they are using a special high strength
stainless, which is expensive, so it wouldn't be a good choice for a
valve, generally. On the plus side, I think, is the fact that it doesn't
conduct heat very well as compared to carbon steel, this feature would
prevent the valve from absorbing as much heat from the hot gases in the
first place. This is the theory behind ceramic coatings for valves - they
run cooler if they have a layer if insulation applied to them. 

One point that is very important is that the poor valve layout in the VW
heads lead to hot exhaust valves because they are not washed with the cool
intake charge during the intake stroke as happens in engines with hemi
heads. Hot spots in the combustion chamber lead to pinging, which is part
of the reason these engines have low compression ratio. The application of
sodium cooled exhaust valves leads to a more uniform temperature in the
combustion chamber, thus making the engine more resistant to pinging. 

Also, the intake valves should remain plain carbon steel instead of 
stainless because the cooler running stainless would reduce fuel 
vaporisation, since the injectors fire directly on the back side of the 
valves. You would want the intakes to be somewhat warm to prevent fuel 
droplets from clinging to either the valve or the intake wall. Also, the 
warning running intake valves makes for a more temperature uniform 
combustion chamber - which is also important to prevent the area of 
aluminum between the seats from cracking (this is a reason to never 
install larger seats and valves in these heads - it makes the area 
between the seats too small, which increases the thermal stress on the 
metal - leading to cracking)

So, if it was me, I'd stick to the factory sodium cooled exhaust valves 
and the plain carbon stell intake valves, but I'd get stealite valve 
seats, if they are available.

You may also like to note that many water-cooled cars and all 
air-cooled piston engined aircraft use these valves. I just wish we could 
get those way-cool aircraft exhaust valves to fit our heads, the heads 
look sortof like an onion, with a convex face (bulges out instead of 
being flat). These would flow much better than the flat faced valves we 
use.
