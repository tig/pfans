Hi Jeffrey,

 First, I pulled the floorboard under the pedals.  My to my surprise :) I
 found another puddle and quite a bit of surface rust under the fluid.
 
 So... Should I now pull the pedal assembly so I can best mop up the puddle
 and coat the area with "Extend", or just work around the pedals?

If your pedal assembly is full of brake fluid you want to pull the pedal
assembly for 2 reasons..  

1)  To clean the general area of rust *and* brake fluid (which attacks the
paint on anything it touches).  Brake fluid is water soluble but it takes a
lot of elbow grease to get all of it mopped up and neutralized.

2)  More importantly, if the pedal assembly still has plastic bushings, you
will want to disassemble it and replace the bushings.  The brake fluid
attacks the plastic material, softening it and causing it to swell, resulting
in sticking pedals.  Even though the pedals may not be sticky now, if you
don't add this to your "while I'm in there" list it will happen later causing
you to have to pull the pedal assembly out *again*.  Although there are brass
(?) bushing kits available for pedal assemblies, I have always stuck with the
plastic.  If the master cyl. develops a leak, it always leaks into the pedal
assembly.  Most of the time it's a slow enough leak that the pedals start to
get sticky before you totally run out of brake fluid.  (That's for those who
never check their brake fluid.  I know no one on this list falls into that
catagory, though I have a great many customers who do).  With the brass
bushings, you never get that symptom of M/C failure.
