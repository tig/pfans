I don't recognize that as a Koni number, they are located in Kentucky.
Better stick with the 606-727-5028 number Dave.  Actually you can talk
directly with their Warranty person, her name is Debbie Angel and can be
reached at 606-727-5030.

Dave - Koni can rebuild the rears at a cost of $85 each.  The fronts can't
be rebuilt. You can factor in the cost of rebuild vs. purchasing new units.
