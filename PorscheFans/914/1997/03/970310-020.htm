Two things...

One:  Most cars have vacuum advance, '74 CA cars do not. This is what
I've been told by more than one source.

Two:  The decel valve is not really an emissions device. In fact, it can
be quite usefull for tuning an engine with a lightened flywheel. What it
does is add a little air while the rpms are dropping to prevent the revs
from dropping too far below idle and stalling out the motor. It is
adjustable and can be used to controll how rapidly the revs drop when
the clutch is put in. For those of you that still have one that works,
keep it. For those of you who's valves are broken or removed, it will
have an impact on how the engine runs in traffic. Specifically, the
ability of the engine to drop to 850 rpm and not below when you pull up
to a light. Removal of that little sucker can have three effects. The
engine won't stay at idle speed and will stall unless you blip the
throttle, the engine takes an eternity to get down to idle speed, or
none of the above. It's pretty much a factor of how much vacuum your
engine pulls and how intact your vacuum lines are. 

And now I have another vehicle with a nest of vacuum lines. This time
it's not engine management, but driveline controll and other asstd
controlls. The differentials lock with a vacuum actuated solenoid and
the brakes and cruise controll and other asstd dohickies are also vacuum
based.
