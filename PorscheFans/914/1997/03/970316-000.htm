Hello P-Fans, 

 Worken on the 914 today with help from buddy and fellow lister.
 I had 16X6's all around (as I HAD on my real 914-6) and deceided to put
the 16X7's on the back, and yes I need to burp the rear fender,  I like
the look if done right. I picked up a set of 6's & 7's polished and
painted and put them on today, looks good!

 If some one is local to me (LA/OC,Calif) and is interested in the set
of 6's , I'd let them go for $350. with caps. I would rather not ship
them.

 So now on to the Question, Now the engine isnt in the car, so I know it
will sit up, but the ground clearence at the front jack pad area is 9
1/2 with 16X6's and 205/55/16's but, still isnt that a little high ?? My
buddys car is 6in off the ground with good ride and handling ? Should I
lower it ? . I could lower it, put on the Turbo tie rods and the
bumpsteer kit, and the crossed drilled vented rotors all at the same
time, make a front end day of it. I have all new part already and know
how to do the work, I just dont know that a good ground clearence is ???

 Can any one help, think it should be easy ?

 Thanks for your time, 

   Don
