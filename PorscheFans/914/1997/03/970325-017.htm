.. . .    The BMW calipers are available new for $150.00 each and directly bolt 
on
the early cars.  73-76 models require shaving of the mounting loops to a
cast mark clearly visable on the caliper.  . . . 

For clarification: If you had a later model 914 and needed new rotors at the 
same time, wouldn't there be a savings (no machining needed) by using the BMW 
calipers and switching to a pair of (new) early style rotors?  

It seems the only downside would be loss of the "centering" ring to hang the 
wheel on while putting in lugbolts (i.e., there is no other advantage to later 
style rotors).  Braking performance, surface for front wheel bearings, and 
everything else is the same between early and late rotors, right?

BTW, if you have the BMW caliper part number handy, the list may benefit from 
it.

P.S.:  I ordered and received a part from AA this week without difficulty and 
at a reasonable price.  It was not even in the catalog (a side window/windwing 
guide rail), but it was available.  Since I posted my previous difficulties 
with your company, I also wanted everyone to know that this time there were no 
problems.  The long distance wasn't even too high since I wasn't put on hold.
