Mike, I've been looking for some hats too.  I've been considering swiping a 
couple of my Wife's good oblong tupperware bowl, drilling a hole in the 
center, and screwing them to the top of my filters with a sheetmetal screw. 
 I think this would work just fine, but I'd never live to tell about it. 
 She likes the car as well as the next person, but I think that'd be 
crossing the line!

More seriously though, a second incentive for my search for some hats would 
be to muffle the intake noise somewhat.  I thought my car was REALLY loud 
and always tried to leave the neighborhood as quietly as possible untill I 
let my wife autocross the car one day.  I was standing there as she roared 
off and was amazed how quiet it was (OEM syle muffler, all stock except the 
Webers)!  I have come to the conclusion therefore that the car's noise 
(can't here yourself talk under full throttle) is due primarily to the 
intake rather than the exhaust.  Anybody got any ideas?
