    Nick:

    The 914 torsion bars work fine... There's no need (or reason) to
    stiffen the suspension to rock-hard levels.

    You WILL want to put larger-than-stock bars in, though... 914s
    can accomodate up to 23 mm bars (stock is around 18 mm).

    Not necessarily... Either method will probably be fine.  The
    important thing, if you decide to drill the hubs, is to use the
    early (1970 ONLY) ones, since they're designed with large metal
    bosses in the 5-bolt locations and therefore won't be weakened
    by the drilling as much as the later hubs will.

    Or you could call John Williamson at Otto's (310 399-3221) and
    see if he has a set of proper 5-bolt rear hubs and rotors that
    he'll sell cheap... You never know.
