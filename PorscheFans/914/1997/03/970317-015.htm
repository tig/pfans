Don,

As previously mentioned, a corner balance is the "right"
thing to do....but you need the adjustable rear spring
perches in order to do that.

I did quite a bit of checking with various "people in the
know" about this and came up with the following:

Go for about 5.5" of ground clearance at the front
of the rocker (measured from the ground to the lower
part of the welded seam of the rocker)

The car should have a slight nose-down attitude of
about 1 degree (which works out to around 0.75"
over the length of the rocker).

The corner balance will alter the ride height somewhat
from front to back and even side to side.  I was told
to set the ride height about where I wanted it and then
to get a corner balance with 1/2 tank of gas and
my weight in the driver's seat.

The alignment for autox/street would be something
like this (if doing less autox then ease up on the camber
a bit - move it more closer to stock):

Front:
-1.5 degrees camber
all the castor you can dial in
1/4" toe IN

Rear:
-1.0 degrees camber
0.00000"  (Zero) toe

Set all the Koni shocks to about 1/3 hard.

Now go out and learn how to drive the car by
learning from the fast 914 drivers out there
and by attending as many autox events as
possible!!!

Oh yeah....listen to Andrew about those
cross drilled rotors...they WILL break.  I've
seen them myself.
