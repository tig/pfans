Clever, that.  Thanks, Dion.

Back to the SUBJ:  my guess is a loose valve guide.  It is more likely 
to move in both directions that a seat.  If you let it go long enough, 
it will be hammered against the back side of the valve, and peel open 
like a banana, spreading bits of brass into the pistons, etc.  
Not pretty.

Don't ask me how I know..
