 Dearest Don, 
  There are so many 914's in California I see at least one a day in my
area, I have bought many 500 dollar rollers that only needed a engine
rebuild, that hasnt been sitting out in the Nevada winters or summers.
Look in the Recycler , there's lots to pick from. Good luck if you get
this one.
 I only said this because I have bought the night mare on wheels (way
back in my early days) It can be an exspencive lesson my son, where did
I here that before.(oh yeah, dad)

 Most important though is to have fun :^)

 Don
