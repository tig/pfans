Well, the interest in this was _so_ underwelming that I am lowering the prices. 
I guess front calipers aren't all that interesting, eh?  If you are at all 
interested - please let me know.  Otherwise this stuff is just going to get 
tossed ;-(.

Also, I have one pair of halfshafts left.  They are $25 for the pair.  These 
aren't as nice as the others that I have sold, but still are servicable.
