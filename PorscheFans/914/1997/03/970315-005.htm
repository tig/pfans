Hi J.J. !

  I found your conversation with Mark Stephens illuminating... thanks for
sharing it with us.
I have only one comment to make on the question that he asked you:

>  He then queried
> me for a currently manufactured aluminum engine that uses sodium-filled
> valves (as opposed to stainless), and I was unable to provide one.

  I think that my response to that would be I can't, but I can't name one
currently manufactured aluminum
engine that is air cooled either.

  On second thought, maybe I can... how about Lycoming and Continental? 
Any airplane buffs out there
who can tell us if these manufacturers are still using sodium-filled
valves?  My bet is that they are.

P.S.  What a dummy I am... Dirk Wright already answered that question... If
I understood him correctly, in the affirmative.
  How about it Dirk... want to expound at length on aircraft engine valves?
 And why can't we make some fit?

							Regards,
							Jim T.
