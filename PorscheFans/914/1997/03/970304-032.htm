Hi Raymond.

Re:

>master cylinder.  Is it worthwhile?
etc.

It's important to note that there are two, _seperate_ rebuild kits for the
17mm and 19mm M/C's -- the main, easily-obtained one does the 17mm / 19mm
bore part of the M/C. (I don't mean to imply that the main kit is the same
for the 17mm and 19mm versions -- of course it's different -- but the
design 17mm and 19mm M/C's is identical save for the bore size). 

But there's _another_ kit that does the failure-detect side of the M/C, and
without that kit you can't safely take the entire unit apart for honing and
subsequent cleaning, flushing and drying.

I have never had one of these "other" rebuild kits, and I don't have the
P/N, or the price.

AND, neither of these kits come with the replacement "grommets" where the
lines go into the M/C from the reservoir.

My feeling is that you really are better off just buying a replacement M/C
-- it's not that much more expensive, and is probably cheaper if you factor
in your time.  And the bore(s) are guaranteed to be in spec.

Just my $.02 ....
