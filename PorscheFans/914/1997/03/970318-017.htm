There is an article in European Car magazine, issue Oct. 1991
page #76, titled "Porsche Fuel Pump Relocation- Tech Procedure.
It is by Greg Raven and he is relocating from the stock location on the 914.
He is Installing BEHIND the steering rack pan.  The pump, filter and hoses. 
He is using the fuel pump relocation kit offered by Automobile  Atlanta.
Describes it as easy to install. States location more effective than
firewall location.

BTW, this issue above has more 914 articles and is truly one you MUST aquire.
Cover is a pic of Roger Sheridan's 914-GT2.  Awesome SCCA club racer.
Pages 66 thru 87 are only 914 articles and very interesting.

Subscription Inquires shows an Illinois phone. 1-800-892-0753
I have no affiliation with Argus, the publisher and pass this info for
knowledge only.
Hope you find this info useful
