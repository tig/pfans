Not a stupid question.  To properly adjust your mixture for idle 
the basic procedure is to get a variable resister (pot) from radio
shack in the 200-1000ohm range or so.   Solder some leads to it 
so you can place it in line with your head temp. sensor.

Play with the dial on the pot until you have the desired mixture
at idle (if you can measure CO yourself) or until the idle stops
hunting.  Remember the factory put a 270ohm resistor in-line with
the temp sensor for this vary reason.  

When you have the setting you like, read the value from the pot and
get a fixed resistor from radio shack as close to that value as
possible,
wire it up in-line with the sensor and you're done.

Need to pass smog again?  Take it out of the circuit...
