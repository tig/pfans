	The 914's wheels are held on by bolts which go through holes in the
wheel into threaded holes in the hub.  In the front, the hub and rotor are
one piece.  It is possible for the holes in the hub to strip out (I've done
one; NEVER use VW Bug screw-in stud kits).
	In the rear, you have to mess with a lot of stuff, including a 200+
ft-lb nut.  The front is a *lot* simpler.  You need a big open-end wrench,
an Allen wrench for the set-screw, the sockets for the two bolts holding the
caliper onto the strut, flare-nut wrenches for disconnecting the caliper
from the car's body (for clearance), and a punch and hammer.  You need the
latter for putting the new wheel bearings into the new rotor (they're cheap
insurance).
	You basically loosen the set-screw, remove the nut (and washer behind
it), pull the rotor, clean the spindle, put new bearings in the new hub/rotor,
pack a bunch of grease in the hub, and then put it onto the spindle.  When
you have the rotor back on, you adjust the play in the bearing (very easy),
put the caliper back on, reconnect it, and bleed the brakes.
	I don't know if I'd buy it or not.  If the font hub was bad enough
for the lug bolts to pull out, there's no telling what other things may be
wrong with the car.  And, of course, bodywork can be expensive on these cars.
If you still want to go for it, check the car extra carefully.
