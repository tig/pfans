Got 'em on my car.  Any questions?  Yeah, you probably do.

I got the heavy-duty ones.  Not because I wanted them, but because
he had only one of the light-duty ones.  The rust on my car had
gone into the top of the frame rail; the "de-ruster" suggested
some form of re-inforcement, and a new rail is $1,000.00

The supports are designed for cars that are ready to snap in half
from rust.  The installer said that he had seen cars with 4x4's (!)
stuffed in the frame tube to keep them together.

They take a lot of work to install.  The rocker covers are removed,
all the sill supports cut out, and these rockers fitted in, the
sill supports re-made, and new rocker covers (or slight mods to
the old ones.)

You have to check your rear suspension alignment before starting:
These things go between the swing arm and the frame, and if there
aren't 1/8" (+) of spacers in there already, you will never get
your rear suspension in line again.

On the plus side, they make the car a _lot_ more rigid.
