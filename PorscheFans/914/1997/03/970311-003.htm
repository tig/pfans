I have gathered some emperical evidence in search of the Reality of the 
behavior of throttle bodies:  

Hooked my vacuum gauge to the retard port and verified that the vacuum 
is same as manifold vacuum when throttle is closed.  It goes to zero 
with any more than just a little throttle opening.  Used a hand pump on 
the distributor retard port, and found that the timing starts to retard 
at about 5" vacuum, going full retard at about 7".

Hooked my vacuum gauge to the advance, and found that my memory from 
Corvair days was not so bad after all.  The advance vacuum starts at 
about 2,000 rpm, and tends to increase with rpm to maybe 4,000.  There 
is no vacuum with either WOT, or closed throttle.  Partial throttle 
yields up to full manifold vacuum, or more.  It can go higher because 
it is a vacuum obtained from high velocity air flowing past an opening, 
and not from the engine's intake strokes.

This is consistent with the purpose of vacuum advance being greater 
fuel economy.  More advance at partial throttle is desirable for fuel 
economy.  It has nothing to do with increased power and only incidental 
to smog, unless you happen to be "weird" enough to believe that saving 
fuel reduces pollution.  Vacuum advance was around long before any smog 
reduction efforts.  The extra timing advance you get with the vacuum 
valve is undesirable at WOT, due to hazards of pre-ignition.

I hooked up the vacuum pump to the distributor advance, and found that 
the advance begins at about 5" vacuum and is fully advanced at 10".

The vacuum advance port depends on air flowing past its opening (or 
Porthole) into the throttle body.  Butterfly position at partial 
throttle routes most of the intake air past the porthole, which 
maximizes the vacuum.  Closed throttle kills that air flow, and WOT 
slows the air velocity past the porthole.

I understand it better now.  Do you?  Did I make it comprehensible?

    There is no better way to learn, than trying to teach.
