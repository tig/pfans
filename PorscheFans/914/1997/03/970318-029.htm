	Great ish.  A friend at work gets EC, wandered in and told
me "you gotta get this one".  So I did.
	Anyway, the article in question is not exactly what I'd call
a technical procedure.  More of the extra-length ad that we've seen
way too many times in the "car mags".  8^P   Most of what it says, if
I recall correctly, is "Wow!  This is great!  And simple!  And solves
all possible 914 problems!  Buy it from AA NOW!"  (That's one of the
problems with "car mags"...)
	BTW, it appears that the instructions call for drilling holes
in the firewall and passenger footwell to run the new wiring.  Yech.
I don't know about the front, but it is not a hideously difficult
matter to shove a few new wires alongside the main harness in that
hole through the firewall.  Done it on a pair of 74s so far.  (Hi,
Josh!)  That's why they make wire coat-hangers.
	I think the last thing that a 914 needs is more holes in
the firewall.

	Gee, I'm in a pissy mood today, ain't I?
