I recently received the following instructions from Rich (A914GUY@aol.com).
Sorry Rich, but I can't find your last name.

Subject: Re: "75/'76 Bumper change

The detail on the bumper change is pretty simple.  Remove both the front and
rear bumper (bolt access is under the bumper pads, 2 to each bumper) bolts.
 If you have fog lights remove these connections as well as the liscence
plate lights in the rear.  The bumpers should now slide out of their brackets
(the ends of the impact shocks).  You should check the sides of each bumper
to see that the rubber edges are unhooked from their respective trim retainer
clips (these clips are small strips welded to the edge of each bumper and
they are accessable by peeling back the edge of the rubber bumper cover).
 After the bumpers are removed you can inspect the impact shocks for their
mounting bolts.  Remove all of these bolts and disguard these shocks and
their brackets.  Now you need to locate the mouning holes (old style mounting
holes, two per side) in the fenders.  You may need to look from the inner
fender side to see the holes.  If they don't go through both pieces of the
fender and body pannels (usually don't) you will have to drill them out.  You
should now be good to go.  Install the new (old style) bumpers and you are
about 50-75 pounds lighter.  If you use OE bumpers remember they require a
rubber "dog-bone" type insulator that goes between the bumper and the body.
 If this isn't insatlled the correct spacing will not be achieved and the
bumper an its top will not align correctly.

Good luck......Rich
