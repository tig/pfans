P-Fans......I have to jump in and post a note concerning Perry Keihl's e-mail
response to Jason Sneed at AA.
This is the first posting of any AA complaint story detailing both
perspectives.  Al, your right about one thing....Its a shame to see a
business like AA get dragged through the mud.
I want everyone to understand this message is intended to produce a positive
outcome.
914s are the common thread that bring all of us to this forum.  Technical
information and casual 914 interaction is what I enjoy from this list's
postings and the other forums that are on-line.  I suspect thats what brings
most of us here.
In reguard to Al and George's comments and having read Perry's response to
Jason, maybe it is important to understand why the e-mail from Perry was
posted here.
There are many suppliers in the Porsche parts sales business.  Most of them
are doing a good job provideing service, repair and resoration products from
OE suppliers and private sector.  In some cases like AA, parts are even being
made for their target markets specialized needs.  I will have to say I have
purchased parts from almost all the 914 suppliers, including some of the
overseas 914 parts distibutors.  My needs have been served well by most of
these these distributors.  I also choose to exclude the businesses that I
have had problems with.
AA is, by most 914ers, a valuable source for parts and information.  This
distinction and the roles held by Mr. Hussey in our 914 community should
distinguish them from the rest of the crowd.  I am not trying to discourage
you or any of your staff George, but how is it possible this perspective
Perry Keihl has is so far off from your view of it?
George, my name is Rich Johnson and I use the address A914Guy.  I post here,
on the Porsche 914 Club's Forum and on Tim Jones 914 Fan's Forum.  Like you,
I am a great fan of the 914.  I'll have to say that I don't understand all
the details of this car deal with Perry, but suggest you approach resolution
in another way.  I for one did not take positively to your recent posting
reguarding this matter.  By making the comment of "get over it" are the rest
of the 914 list members (some being your present customers) supposed to think
this is an insignificant matter?  Or is the issue of a 914 being represented
improperly unimportant?  Maybe time is the factor here I don't understand.
 After the car leaves the lot is its condition at that time of deliverly
moot?  I just can't believe you would take that position.  
I challange you George, to personally contact Mr. Keihl and see what his
complaints are and make an honest effort to address them.  I am not
suggesting I know how to solve the problem between you two, but I think it
would be pertinent to try to provide restitution.  Jason has obviously
challenged Perry's perspective of AA and found a very unhappy past customer.
 
Don't you think provideing this type of customer service would be a positive
statement?  I do.  How about you Jason?
I guess I feel AA's reputation has everything to gain from making a satisfied
customer out of someone who seems to take issue with some of your business
practices.  Like you he seems very involved in promoting 914s.  Do the right
thing guys.  Maybe this forum can shed some light on your committment?  I
suspect Perry would be very happy to know you are still concerned.   
Parts and technical support for the 914 is important to all of us and the
strides George, Jason and the AA staff are making to improve their customer
service is commendable.  I hope everyone's purchase experience with them can
be positive ones.    
Sorry Al, for bringing this up again.  I also appologize to anyone else who
finds these issues insignificant or old news.  Like many of the folks on this
list I spend alot of time and money purseing 914 happiness.  When I do find
items I need I feel much better knowing I have been taken care of and not
taken to the cleaners.  I share Perry's expectations when dealing with
suppliers of parts and services.  Integrity means everything in my companies
business and as a Manager of Customer Service I take it to heart.  I'll close
without an adolescent note and will look forward to something good coming
from this.
