 Hi Clemson, 

 It all depends on what you want to do with the car ? restore it, autoX
it, daily driver  ??? In my opinion the 73 2.0L is the best all around
914 . With a 73 the chances of it being a 2.0L is good and with 73's it
more likely to have everything on it, ie; center console, sway bars,2L
Fuchs, fog lights.
 There are some of the most Porsche wise 914 people in the world on this
list , and you will get different takes on this question and there
really isnt a wrong answer as long as you have fun and dont buy a rusty
914 !!!!

 Tossin in my 2 pennys, 

  Don
  73 914-6 (soon to be GT flared)
