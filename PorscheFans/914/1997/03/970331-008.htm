I am in desperate need of a smog pump pulley for my '76 2.0.  I spent an
entire day cruising junkyards tearing apart VW busses looking for just
one pulley.  No luck.  I called all of the Porsche shops and dealers in
my area, and they didn't have any luck, either.  One of the Porsche
shops recommended I call the state and shoot for a waiver, since the
part is NLA.  I called, but they said that it didn't matter, I needed to
find the part to pass emissions.  So, I'm hoping that just one of the
450+ members of this list have removed their pulley and would be willing
to part with it for a little green.  In case you don't know what it
looks like, here's a description:  Starting at the bottom, there is a
metal disk about 2 inches in diameter with three holes in it.  "Glued"
to this is a rubber, 3-point star shaped piece of rubber about as thick
as a hockey puck.  Glued to the other end of the "puck" is a matching
3-point star shaped piece of metal.  The two pieces of metal form a
sandwich around the rubber star.  Welded to the center of the star
shaped piece of metal is the shaft (approx. 5 in. long) for the pulley.
On the end of the shaft is the pulley, about 3 inches in diameter.
Around the shaft is a bearing, and attached to the bearing are three
"arms", one points straight down, and the others point out to the left
and right.  The arms are about 5 inches long.  The end of the shaft with
the sandwiched rubber star bolts to the engine fan, and the three arms
bolt to the fan housing, allowing the pulley to stick about 1/2 inch out
of the fan housing and drive the smog pump which is mounted on top of
the housing.  Again, if anyone has one, or has any idea where I might be
able to find one, please let me know.  I'd hate to dump all of this time
and money into my car, only to discover that I can't drive it legally!

Thanks,
