	Big line (green) is for manifold vacuum for  the vacuum retard.
The other  line that goes in the  top  (small)  is for the  vacuum
advance.  That  is the one  that  goes to the ported  vacuum  on the
throttle body  (along  with  egr, whic year is it?).

PS: I had to disconnect my decel valve  because my idle vacuum was
so  high, it would get fooled into thinking I was  decelerating while
stopped.  SOmetimes at a stoplight, the RPMs  would go to 2500 for  
no  reason.  THe decel valvewas the cause.  I just removed and  plugged
the small vacuum  lineto  it.
