Dirk the injector, throttle switch, coldstart valve, pressure sensor, etc.
leads are available new as an assembly to crimp and then heatshrink on, and
the individual parts of each lead are available along with the injector
boots. Many used 2.0 control unit harnesses are still available and most
are easily repaired (in several hours) to look and work well enough for
most applications.  There was some chat in the last couple of months about
someone making new wiring harnesses(They advertised in Mid Engined Views)
but we have not investigated them.
