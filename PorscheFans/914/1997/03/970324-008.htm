Sorry for the bandwidth everyone else.

I've been trying to send this for several days Mike, but it keeps getting
kicked back with  "Host connect failed - destination host does not respond
correctly."   when I send to  "Mikel @ ichips.intel.com"     trying again.

Subject was:  Re: 911 front hubs with long studs

----------------------original---------------------------
Hi Mike,

I'm not sure if what I have is what you need, or viceversa.  I'll describe
my setup and what I have.

Car (73 2.0L 914)  as I got it has 5 lug 911 Fuch rims, mounted using
4-5lug adapter plates, which I want to get rid of.  For the front I had
been considering getting 911 structs, rotors, calipers from a swap meet.
Then Don picked up for me at a swap meet a set of 914 rear hub and rotors
converted to 5 lug with 45mm studs, and a set of converted front rotors
with 66mm studs. I checked with a dial caliper and the specs from
Automotion catalog, as near as I can tell (haven't cleaned surface rust off
yet so some variation with the dial caliper) the front rotors haven't been
turned, or only once, close to the 11mm spec for new. The rear rotors have
been turned at least once but still above the min spec.

I've since got a set of new bearings for the front rotors and had picked up
a set of BMW front calipers to try that conversion but haven't started
yet..

It was those front rotors I was asking about on the net, planning to cut
the studs shorter but haven't done it yet. But these are 914 rotors not
911.  When you say hubs are you talking about the rears?  Or did you mean
the front struts,hub, rotor? Not sure of the terminology.

Jeff
