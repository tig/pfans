	The numbers are in more than one place one in front, one in back, 
one in center. Ask your local insurance adj. to tell you where they are. 
I have seen more than one car with numbers not matching. It took me 8 
years to find my 6 and I looked at alot of cars, and saw alot of fakes. 

I was at the track this weekend and saw one of our list members with a 
914-6 club sticker in the window and a 47xxxxx vin number.

Dan

PS: my # is 587   The 587th 914-6 made
