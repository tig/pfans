Ah, the eternal dillema of the 914...

This is for a track car right? Not a street car. First thing is CHECK
THE RULES. This is very important for track car if you have _any_
intensions of competing with it. Some minor work to install your oil
cooling hardware may violate some rule somewhere and bump you into a
mega buck class.

o.k. now that's out of the way. I would say that the location you
mentioned is probably the simplest, but also the least effective. There
is not going to be much cold air hitting the cooler in that location.
There is heat exhaust from the RHS engine air, radiant heat from the
exchangers, and heat from the tranny as well. The best location is of
course in front of the car. Bumper mounted is usually a very popular
method. I have seen some mounted into the bumper and holes cut in the
front trunk to exhaust the heated air. Although I like the idea of
exhausting the heated air thru the fresh air intake grille and up over
the windshield. That's what alot of the modified cars do. Another
location I've seen is protuding up from the rear trunk. I have seen them
recesed and flush in a rear wing or spoiler. These all require alot of
extra oil and expensive oil lines. It all depends on your budget for
this project. An easier location is of course hanging from the engine
lid. This is the route I took. Partly because of the ease of
installation, and partly because the rules in my class dont allow
cutting of sheet metal.

On any large oil cooler you should already have upgraded the oil system
as much as bolt-in changes can be done. By this I mean higher pressure
relief pistons and a high volume oil pump. Try these first and see how
much the temp comes down. It will, but not by a huge amount. I have a
25-row fan-forced oil cooler mounted to the engine grille, and I can get
up to a 30-40 degree drop in temps from what I was running before. The
fan alone is worth 25 degrees. My whole package cost me about $700
including thermostat and aeroquip lines.

If I were you, look into mounting up front, your engine will thank you.
If it were for a street car, I'd be nervous mounting a big oil cooler up
front. Especiall if the car is lowered. One big piece of road debris,
and that's it.

The first step is usually enough. And that is the installation of
extended oil sump, or oil-trap. I have found that I no longer get oil
starvation in sweepers. And it's ALOT cheaper than an accusump, lighter
too. They're about $50 or so. It replaces the plate cover for the oil
strainer with a cup the extends down about two inches or so, and extends
the pickup tube to draw from the bottom of this cup. Works great.

You bought a 25 year old sports car and want to race it, I'd say the
question of your sanity is a moot point. But there are financialy
forgiving methods of getting these cars up to the task and still leave
money left over for race tires and registration fees. I hope this helps.
If you have any further questions don't hesitate to ask.
