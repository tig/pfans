Don:

If you really want to do it RIGHT, you should get your car 
corner-balanced... Without adjustable rear ride-height, there will be 
only one optimal front ride-height.

If you don't want to go to the trouble of corner-balancing, the
correct front ride-height is whatever you think looks good.  Be
advised that the bumpsteer-kit installation is a total pain in the
ass... Plan on spending a fair amount of time on it.

Also... Unless you've already purchased them, you may want to 
reconsider the use of drilled rotors; they ALWAYS crack.
