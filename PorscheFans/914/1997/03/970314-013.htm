Hi Nick,

What about rear hubs and CV joints?  I'm not familiar with the
"factory" 914-6 route on this....I went another route.  Hopefully
somebody else can answer this.

A friend of mine has 15x7 wheels with 205/50 tires...gentle rolling
of the fender lips was required in order to get them to fit.  You'd
probably be OK.

The 10 or 12 piece chassis stiffening kit is something you
probably will NOT need for street use.  I know of racers out
there who may need it, but street tires with "hard" street
driving doesn't tax the 914 frame that much.

I'd do that shock/spring setup...hey....I did!!!  :-)

If you are considering flares, then you've got to fill them
with something...and wide wheels and tires cost $$$.
Fiberglass flares generally suck quality-wise and
steel 914-6 GT flares cost about $1000 or more for the
set.

I believe both the Chalon and the 914-6 GT can use
15x8 for the front and 15x9 for the rear...so get some prices
on those while you're at it.

I think a 2.4 with an S cam and carbs might be too "peaky".
The FI uses the S cam better than the carbs.  You might like
the '66 Solex grind better.  You'll get more torque earlier on
which is better for street use - yet still retain the "peaky" feel
you like.

Wait a minute....2.4 from a 2.0???  If you're using the long crank
then why not build the 2.7RS engine?

(This is starting to sound like Andrew's car....why not buy his???)

The 2.4S with the stock FI is supposed to be a very nice engine.

This is a nice "comfortable" engine.  It'll make your tiny 914
move along quite well....  :-)
