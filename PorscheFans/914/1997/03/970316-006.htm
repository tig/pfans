Derek and All,
I too have been more than satisfied with AA purchases. My total being less
than a GRAND in 20 years. The point I was hoping to express is that there
are everyday ethics to follow. When a person spends $14,000 for a 914, from
someone who we take into our trust for his dedication to prolong the 914, we
would expect what was described, if not more.

Personally, I purchased a 1973 914S last year with low miles, with factory
installed Fuchs for just a $1000 from an individual locally. The rust was
there, but so well covered, it was not detected by my experienced EAGLE EYE
inspection. I am sure that this is a story that some of us on the list have
encountered. I ordered the metal from AA and it was an easy fix because of
the exactness of the parts which AA manufactured.

I have praised AA many times to others as many of us do. I was disappointed
to read that a deal like what was described could have occured involving
someone I held in my high esteem list of very FEW in the world. Only the
other day, I sent a personal note of thanks and praise for dedication to the
914 by AA. 

Doesn't matter what I think. I am not buying anything since I am broke,
retired and can't afford to ever finish my 914 anyhow. Still some other
known rust, but may cover, paint and sell. Others do. Nah, I can't do that.
I am not that desperate to compromise my integrity. Thats all I have left in
the world.  

This Internet thing sure comes in clear, and fast. Isn't it great?
