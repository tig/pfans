Very Interesting ;)

Two weekends ago I replaced the speedo drive O-ring on my transmission.
Since I needed to drain, I refilled with new stuff. I had pondered long and
hard about what to use - Swepco or RedLine MTL. I went to a local Mercedes
repair shop that had both and asked for their recommendation. I ended up
with the RedLine MTL.

Prior to changing, I have always had a problem doing the 1st to 2nd shift.
If I am careful and not too quick it doesn't make noise, but about half the
time, I get a little syncro noise. After putting in the MTL, I went for a
drive. Probably made a dozen starts and only ONE time did the shift make
any noise. I even got a little sloppy with my shifting and it almost always
shifts perfectly. That was over a week ago and my conclusion stands - the
MTL made a big difference and I don't have to wait until the tranny is
warm.

BTW, I had been using 80/90 GL5 dino gear lube with a bit of Dow GearGuard
(a molybdenum additive) in the tranny for several thousand miles prior to
this change.

Anyone else using MTL?
