	Hmmm...  Josh2's car is a 10/73 car, and it didn't have the
vacc advance when he bought it.  Mine is also a 10/73 car, and the
advance fitting on the throttle body looks home-brew.  It's kinda off-
center in the boss, and not quite perfectly perpendicular to it.  Now,
those could be replacements from later in the car's life, but it is
a rather big coincidence for *both* to have late 74 TB's retrofitted.
	It may also be that (as Josh's friends have said) the CA-smog
74 models were the ones with the line removed, or there may be some
other pattern.  (Or heck, maybe none at all!)  And, as we all know,
Karmann wasn't always the best at putting "X model year" parts on an
"X model year" car--they liked to use what they had on hand...  Aah,
the joys of owning a hand-built car!
