Hi all.

It's been a while since I've posted anything.  I've had a few weeks of on and
off job-related traveling.

I'm glad to see that the horrible message-repeater problem was cured by the
gurus of cyberspace administration.

I'm a little curious.  Over the last three weeks, I've received one post per
week.  I don't perceive that that is the normal amount of postings on the digest
mode, as there seem to be discussion missing from my posts.  The last one was
from 3-23 (only one entry), the one before that was from 3-18, and one before
that around 3-12.  I queried Jim Meyer and Bill Newlin about it, as I was going
away (sort of like a personal "Good Bye" to them) and Jim said his receiving
record has been muddled too.

Am I in a situation where I should unsubscribe and resubscribe?  Or, is there
just some weird cyber-problem and I should muddle through it? Jim told me that I
can go find all postings chronologically listed somewhere like an archives area,
but I've been too lazy to figure that part out yet (actually I've been too busy
since getting back from travels).

Any help will be appreciated.

BTW, it's clearly spring here in Dallas, and speed fever is in the air.  We even
have a new race tracj getting ready to debut in a couple weeks.  After getting
back from other parts of the country that are still in deep hibernation, I'm
glad to be a transposed northerner.  I don't miss shoveling snow, and I love the
smell of racing gas : - )  I used to be jealous of the Californians and
Floridians who published car-type magazines, and got to drive at speed year
round.  Somehow, I've become a southern speed merchant myself.  Snow's fun to
visit, but I'll take an autocross any day : - )
