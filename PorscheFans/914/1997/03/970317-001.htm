Now that I've got the heads off, I finally had a chance to see just how
bad the dropped valve seat was.  I think it could have been worse, so I
guess that's a good thing.  The seat was pinched under the valve, and
the piston whacked it a couple of times.  This resulted in a small
(~3/4in.) arch-shaped "dent" about as deep as a wood toothpick.  I
believe (hope) that if I just file the rough edges down, I'll be O.K.
What do you guys think?  It is obvious that as combustion (and contact
between the piston and the head) occurred, the head was "lifted" from
the cylinder and exhaust gasses were allowed to escape.  This has me a
little more concerned.  Other than inspecting the heads for cracks, is
there something else I should do?  Now for a general question:  On the
other head (no dropped valve seat), it appears that I've got an oil leak
at one of the case studs.  The stud doesn't appear to be loose, but
there's definitely leakage around the stud.  Can I simply back the stud
out, wrap it in Teflon, and re-install it?  I don't know any machinists
in my area (I'm sure there are some, I just haven't looked), and I'd
hate to have to take the motor apart completely.  Any advice?

Thanks again... I don't know what I'd do without this list!
