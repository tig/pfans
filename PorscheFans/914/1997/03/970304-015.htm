Ray, the downside of the decreased pedal travel is increased pedal effort
due to the fact that you are pushing more fluid with the same stroke.  The
factory installed a 19mm cylinder on the sixes because the caliper pistons
were bigger than their four brothers so "things" relitively equaled out.
Conclusion, the 19mm master cylinder on a stock four is not all it is
chaulked up to be.
