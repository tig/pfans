Well, my motto is "if it ain't broke, don't fix it.". Unless you don't
trust the rebuild and want to redo it yourself.

What does the oil smell like? It could also be transmission oil leaking
from the input shaft seal.

Unless you plan on splitting the case and installing a stock (or FI
designed) cam, forget the FI. The D-jet FI can't handle agressive cams.
Too bad, but 'dems the breaks with a 30 year old FI design.

Not too much. The cost of new pistons and jugs aren't terribly high, and
there really aren't overbore kits available. There used to be big-bore
kits, but I don't know if they're available anymore.

Yow! Those are pretty high numbers. Definately try it again when warm.

You believe it was rebuilt by a reputable builder? If not, then anything
is possible.
