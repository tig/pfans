I've seen that one, it is in the Atlanta area. I've also seen a blue
Plymouth Horizon with the plate BEYOND. Those two are the most memorable
I've encountered -- largely because the humor on each plays off both the
model and color of the cars involved.

Been trying to think of one for my 914 -- but never came up with
anything I though was clever enough to spend money on. It is hard to
make a play off of '914.' Nothing has come to me related to the car's
bright baby blue color. And Georgia is still limited to only 6
characters on custom plates. 

I ended up deciding that my car is distinctive enough as it is, so I did
not need to do anything else to distinguish it from the dozen or so
other 914's I may encounter every year (grin).

But here are a few ideas...
CMXIV            (914 in roman numerals)
2TRUNKS
911PLUS3
FSTNLOW
MIDENG
ERLYBXTR

Also, I remember in the past running across a web site devoted to
compiling a big list of custom plates. You should be able to find it via
the standard search engines. Maybe you will come across something
appealing that someone in a different state is using.
