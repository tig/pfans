	Josh2 got to try both.  His 74 2.0 didn't have the advance line,
so (after a while) he swapped throttle bodies and added it.  He said that
there was a noticeable difference in pick-up.
	I bought my 74 2.0 with the advance line already on it.  Couldn't
tell you about any difference.
	Someone told me that George H's diagram lists the advance line as
not there on "some 2.0".  Josh2's friends over at High Performance House
told him that it wasn't there on California cars only.  Me, I have no clue.
