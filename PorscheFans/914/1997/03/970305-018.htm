My $0.02:

I'm up to my elbows in a 5 bolt conversion. I've replaced the front
struts, hubs and brakes, and I'm currently with the old rear hubs and
bearings out with the replacements to go in this weekend. Along the way
I found the MC, and brake lines (both hard and soft) needed replacing as
well. If you haven't yet purchased the parts you owe yourself contacting
Rich Johnson (A914Guy@AOL.Com). For about $300 less than you quoted he
made up really nice set up for me. Up front there are powdercoated 911
struts modified for big brembos, BIG 4-pistoned 944T calipers in nicely
refurbished condition, new bearings, Bilstein struts, and new metal
master pads. For the rear he sent modified early style 914-4 hubs, new
bearings, and OEM 914-6 rotors. That also included a set of alloy lug
nuts and locks. Having driven the car with just the front changes for a
couple weeks until I could make time to do the rears I can tell you that
the big Brembos up front stop you with authority (I think it ripped some
fillings loose on the last 60-0 stop). Definitely worth looking into.
