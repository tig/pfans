Just to keep everyone posted on the "Mark Stephens Experience" (and to
ask a few questions of my own):

	Today, I spoke with Mark Stephens himself after they received my heads.
 He told me that I've got two cracks on each of the spark plug holes,
and he highly recommends re-welding and time-serting the holes.  That'll
set me back an additional $110.  I've also got damage around the head
where the intake valve seat dropped, to the tune of $25.  I've got a
cracked stud boss, but he said it wasn't super-critical that I fix it,
so I'm going to save myself the $45.  The rebuild (New guides, seats,
exhaust valves, valve job, and fly cut) is $209/head for the 2.0.  So,
the entire job is now going to cost me $553+shipping, assuming that they
find no other problems (pray for me).  This is about $200 more than the
original estimate that inspired me to send the heads to Mr. Stephens in
the first place.  Needless to say, I'll be eating a lot of Ramen over
the next few months.  
	He's going to cc the heads for me ($7.50), so I've got to figure out
the distance from the top of the piston @ TDC to the top of the cylinder
(deck height?), while bolted down.  Is there an easy way to do this?
All I personally own is a ruler... what should I get to perform this
measurement (I assume it's got to be pretty accurate)?  Just as a side
note, he said that they've found that people running a lower compression
ratio with the metal gasket (spacer?) have more problems, including
pinging, than people running a higher compression ratio without the
gasket.

Again, any and all advice will be GREATLY appreciated!

Thanks,
