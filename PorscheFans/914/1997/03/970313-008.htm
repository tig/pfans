Hello List Members, 
 Since this is an open forum and 914 related item, I feel the need to
pass this on to all of you. I have stated my feelings here in the past
and have taken some harsh words for doing so. I too feel like this is a
big family, and thats the only reason Im passing this on, we need to
watch out for each other. We all have done our far share of buisness
with AA, and I know George has done many things in the name of Porsche.
So dont e-mail me, I didnt write it and Ive heard it before. Just read
on, and you be the judge...

There has been some dialog with AA on their customer service.  This is a
response from Perry Keihl to Jason Sneed - AAs
director of customer service.

Jeff,
Here's my reply to a letter I got from Jason Sneed at Automobile
Atlanta,
please post it after his letter to me on the forum.  I know it's almost
a
manuscript, but I didn't want to leave anything out.  Thanks.  Hope you
had a
good vacation.  TTT is at printers, should be ready by this weekend. 
I've
got some photos in the works, and I'll be contacting you about the
possibility of a color cover!  Chatted a while last night, went very
well.
 Any chance you could come to the California event???  This would be a
great
time to have an executive meeting!  Talk to you later Jeff.

Jason,

You have had a tough job indeed, and I do not envy you.  As a result of
my
becoming an officer of the Club, I receive numerous calls from 914
owners all
over the country inquiring about membership, tech advice, and some just
to
talk 914.  Almost without fail some seven out of ten people that call me
have
an unsolicited gripe about Automobile Atlanta.  For awhile I actually
kept a
tally of how many people made complaints about Automobile Atlanta. 
These
complaints range from haughty attitudes by telephone staff, to
difficulties
in transactions.  I have no way in knowing the entire circumstances of
these
complaints, or when these problems may have occured.

I would like to detail for you the last major transaction I had with
Automobile Atlanta, and subsequent dissatisfaction as a result of that
purchase.  Perhaps this will provide some insight.  I realize this
occured
prior to your tenure with Automobile Atlanta.  If this is an indicator
of
standard practices before your employment, it may give you insight into
attitudes that will be difficult to change.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Thanksgiving weekend of '92 I made a trip to Automobile Atlanta to
look
at purchasing a 914.  I had been a devoted customer for several years at
that
point, and trusted George to be the "ultimate athority" on 914's.  I
beleived
the claims made in your catalog about "selling only rust-free southern
cars".
 After spending significant time and money restoring a 914 with rust
problems, I thought this would be the best way to get a real fine car,
from
what I thought to be the premier source.  My incorrect assumption was
that if
I paid top dollar for a car from George, it wouldn't have any rust.

While there, I looked at several cars, and test drove a few.  George was
more
than gregarious, and took time showing me around your comprehensive
facility,
and even took me to dinner.  There was one car in the showcase that
really
caught my eye, a '73 2.0 Marathon Blue, with steel flairs, 5 lug Fuchs
wheels, "M" front calipers, and suspension upgrades.  When I inquired
further
about this car I was told that it had been in some ads entitled "Should
this
car be saved?".  This car had been wrecked, restored, and flaired in the
process.  The asking price was $15,000 I believe.  When I asked George
why it
was so expensive, he told me "because it's a '73 2.0",  it had some
notoriety
as well.  The car had also been featured in a brief article in Grass
Roots
Motorsports.  After mulling it over, I decided to purchase this car for
the
sum of $14,000.  I have to admit to not going over this car with a fine
toothed comb, it was clean, fast, and after all this was one of
"George's"
collection, in the showcase and all, also the overlying statement in
your
catalog you sell only rust free cars.

About a month and a half after I got home with the car, the interior
light
had been left on and the battery was drained.  I went to remove the
battery,
and noticed that the engine shelf on that side was kind of rusty under
the
new paint.  While in the process of removing the battery, I dropped an
11mm
socket, that really made a funny sound as it fell.  I went to try and
grab
it, and found a hole below the battery tray (the tray and stand had been
replaced by AA) about 6" to 8" long that was 1 1/2" to 3" wide.  I
looked
under the car for the socket, and the drop light in the engine bay
revealed a
inner fender remenicent of swiss cheese.  I can't describe the sinking
feeling resultant of this discovery.  By the way, it took me three hours
to
fish that socket out!
