Hello Listers, 

 Since I have received enough mail on the topic, I will tell you all. 
 The combo gauge I referred too the other day was made for me by Fellow
914'er Stan Cooper (71154.331@compuserve.com). He and many of us doing
Six conversions have a dilema with the gauge issue, If we put the 911
temp/press gauge in the 914 fuel location, where do we put the
aftermarket VDO fuel gauge ? (hole in dash, center console ??) 
 In steps Stan, Having the same problem Stan deceided to do something
about it. He designed a front and rear plate to house a late style 911
temp/press and a early style 914 fuel gauge, all in a stock 914
housing.It looks like a 904 gauge but, with a 914 face plate.It looks
like a factory gauge ! All I can say is, its the most beautiful work of
art I have ever seen, Dr Porsche would have been proud !!!
 The down side to all of this, is Stan deceided not to make any more : (
 (kinda like me and the GT lids) He sold off everything to Palo Alto
Speedo and they are/where going to make them , I heard the other day
that they have put the gauge on the back burner for 6 months, I dont
know why with all the calls they have gottin ?? (415) 323-0243
 Today (3/9) at the Porsche swap meet in Pomona, I saw Stan and told him
about all you guys wanting the gauge and Palo Alto not making them. He
dosnt know if he would want to make any more but is thinking about it. 
 Unless you guys want to pay Hollywood speedo to make you a 904 gauge
for $750, Yes Seven Hundred and Fifty !! Call Palo Alto speedo and bug
the hell out of them ! You can try emailing Stan, but he is a busy guy
and dosent know if he wants to take it on again, But he is thinking...
 EVERYONE who has seen the gauge just has to have one, Dont let it slip
by, CAll Palo Alto (415) 323-0243 first.

 Take care and Good Luck, 

  Don
  73 Six

PS. let me know who it goes...
