No real tricks but you could do what I plan to do if you are concerned
about the cables.  Since I'll be pulling the engine and repainting car
eventually along with other restoration stuff, I plan to replace all the
cables with new ones and keeping the current working ones as the spares.
They should be good enough to use in an emergency until I get another new
one if I has a problem on the road.

Subject:  Cables




O.K., I thought of a few more things that I should do while I've got my
engine out, especially after hearing all of the horror stories regarding
broken cables.  My speedometer cable still works, but I don't know how.
It's just completely shredded.  Any recommendations as to easy
installation tricks or even where I should get a new one from?  The
clutch cable appears to be O.K., but I'm thinking that I should at least
get a spare.  Anything else I should do to the clutch (bushings, etc.)?
How about the throttle cable?  Mine appears to be O.K., but again, I
should probably get a spare.

Any recommendations would be GREATLY appreciated.

Thanks,
