I had the same problem in my '76 - until I discovered I had hooked up 
the two big hoses backwards.  If vac is hooked to the end port, it 
pulls the valve open.  Vacuum goes to the side port.  

De-cel valves have been around since long before the 914.  They are 
there to reduce pollution, and are supposedly effective.  I can't 
remember which ingredient of smog, but it's for sure that high vacuum 
will pull oil into the chamber if there is any blowby at all.  All you 
lose by having a decel valve is engine braking - which you sure don't 
need with Porsche brakes.  The three hoses also make it a bit messy.

The decel valve is typical of the cheesy efi installation.  It's like 
they tried to make it as messy as possble, rather than sanitary.
The de-cel valve, the aux air valve, and maybe some other things could 
have been mounted into the intake box, eliminating most of the hoses.
