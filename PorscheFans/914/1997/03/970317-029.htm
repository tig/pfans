Hi J.J. !

  In reply to your questions:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Uh oh.  This is something that I've never heard of.  When I rebuilt my
engine the last time, we put a thin metal ring in-between each of the
cylinders and the case, and another in-between the cylinders and the
head.  Then we just bolted everything down.  We never did any 
gluing.  I haven't noticed any leaks, but I think this may become 
another one of those "while I'm at it" things...  Can you give me more 
information on this gluing process?
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

  I quote from "How to Hotrod  VolksWagen Engines" by Bill Fisher:

 " Cylinder base gaskets - Don't use 'em unless you can get metal 
ones - which are also useful for setting deck height.  All you need is 
gasket-sealing compound between the cylinder base surface and the 
crankcase.  Paper gaskets should not be used because they can 
squash out under the holding pressure - causing oil leaks.  And, it is 
all too easy to break them during installation, which causes the same 
problem.  Permatex Aviation Form-A-Gasket No. 3, Gasgacinch or 
RTV are recommended sealants."

  I quote from "How to rebuild your VolksWagen Air-Cooled Engine" 
by Tom Wilson:
  "Apply Permatex 3H to cylinder base and any gaskets or shims that 
go there.  If you choose not to use them, Permatex 3H or silicone 
sealer alone will effectively seal the joint."

  
  Regarding "cc-ing the heads:

  This gets kind of involved... I'll give you the condensed version, as I 
understand it, and then if you have any further questions, perhaps I 
can amplify:
  Basically, you need to set the compression ratio.  Compression ratio 
is determined by dividing the fixed volume of the cylinder by the 
variable volume.  The variable volume, or "swept volume" is simply 
the area of the cylinder bore multiplied by the length of the stroke.
  For a 2.0 litre engine with stock barrels and crank, this works out as 
follows:

  Bore = 94mm
  Stroke = 71mm

  Area of circle = Pi R**2  (fortran notation for exponentiation)

  Area of bore = 3.14159*(94/2)**2   =  6939.78 mm**2

  Swept Volume = Area*Stroke  =  6939.78*71=492724 mm**3

  Fixed Volume = Combustion Chamber Volume + Top of Cylinder 
Volume.

  Combustion Chamber Volume is measured:  Get a cc calibrated 
syringe, and with valves and plugs installed, and head as ready to go 
back on engine, inject water from the syringe until it just fills the 
combustion chamber... the irregularly shaped part around the valves. 
 Do NOT fill up to where the sealing ring goes; this volume will be 
calculated from cylinder measurements.  Do several times, averaging 
measurements, and do for all four combustion chambers..  Use the 
SMALLEST volume... this is the worst case compression ratio.

  Top of Cylinder Volume:  Part of this is measured, and part is 
calculated.  If your pistons are dished (most are), use the syringe trick 
and measure the volume of the dishes; use the smallest volume as 
before.
  The rest, or "deck height" volume, is determined by measuring with 
a depth gauge, or the probe end of a caliper, the distance between 
the top (undished rim) of the piston, and the crush-ring mating surface 
at the top edge of the cylinder.  This is done with the piston at Top 
Dead Center.  Convert to mm and multiply by the  bore area above 
(6939.78 mm**2) to get the "deck volume".
  Measure the thickness of one of the crush rings that came out of 
your engine when you pulled the heads.  The new rings should be 
prety much the same thickness after they are torqued down.  Again, 
convert to mm and multiply by the bore area to get the volume added 
by the crush ring.

  Calculate the fixed volume:

  Fixed Volume = Combustion Chamber Volume + Crush Ring Volume 
+ Deck Volume + Piston Dish Volume.

  For a typical 914 running 7.6 to 1 compression, this should be in the 
neighborhood of 65 cc.  The variable, or swept volume in cc is the 
volume calculated above in mm**3 divided by 1000, or 492.7 cc.

  The compression ratio is then found by dividing the swept volume 
by the fixed volume.  492.7/65=7.6 to 1.

  The catch is that you may find that one or more of your combustion 
chambers is considerably smaller in volume than standard, because 
of machine work done on the head.  If your fixed volume works out 
to 55cc, for example, instead of 65cc, then your compression will be 
almost 9 to 1!  This will either break the engine, require you to burn 
gas that you can't get anymore, or fail smog... or all three.
  If any of the fixed volumes comes in low, then you will have to put 
shims under the cylinders to move them farther away from the crank, 
which increases the fixed volume.  The shims go between the 
cylinder base and the crankcase, and are probably the true purpose 
of what you have in your engine, rather than sealing.
  The shims come in .010" or .020" steps up to .090", so pick a 
number, calculate the volume that it provides (don't forget to convert 
inches to millimeters) and add that volume to your fixed volume.  
Then recalculate your compression ratio.  When it comes out about 
where it should be (no more than 8 to 1; 7.6 to 1 stock) then buy that 
thickness of shim (you will need 4, one for each cylinder) from Mark 
Stephens and put them in.  The reason that I suggest Mark 
Stephens is that he has the shims in any of those thicknesses in one 
piece; DON'T stack shims!  You want only one ring between the 
barrel and the crankcase.

  If you find that the compression ratio is OK without shims, then put it 
together with glue and have fun!  (You may also find that the ones 
you took out are just the right thickness; if they haven't been dinged 
up, I'd put them back in.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
I have a feeling that I'm going to have to pull the barrels for one
reason or another.  I've got a friend's shop that I can use to re-hone
the cylinders, but I'll need to get some new rings.  This brings up
another question...  What're the best rings to use?  I've got Total
Seals in there right now, but I didn't have enough experience with 
the
previous rings (Deves?) to tell if the Total Seals were worth the extra
cash.  Any opinions?
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

  I really don't have an opinion; you might ask around on the list.  I 
never heard of Total Seals until I started reading 914 catalogues...  I 
would think (no experience now) that whats good enough for 
Porsche originally (and the rest of the automotive world) would be 
good enough for me, and put gap-type rings in.

			Good Luck,
			Jim T.
