Hi Ed!

  You asked:

1.7L

> Pins 8 to 10 : 340 ohms
> Pins 8 or 10 to 7 or 15 : 35 ohms

    Before you rush out and spend money, be sure to check a few things. 
First, I ASSUME that you are making these measurements with the wiring
harness connector DISCONNECTED from the manifold pressure sensor.  If not,
you need to try again, as the electronics in the ECU will cause erroneous
readings.  I know that that sounds silly, but not everyone has an intact
rubber boot on their connector, and if the boot is missing, then it is a
temptation to stick the meter probes down inside the connector from the
back because it's easier.  If you are measuring the sensor by itself, and
get the same readings, then check the following:

  Second,  my MPS was a rebuild supplied by Automotion and was incorrectly
assembled.  The two holes that allow atmospheric pressure to enter the unit
as a reference are supposed to point down with the unit installed.  Mine
point to the side.  This allows a considerable volume of water to be
trapped inside the thing if it should see some real weather.  Since I live
in the desert, I am not too worried about it, but if your unit is similar,
and you live in a wet climate, try dismounting it from the car and turning
it so that these holes point down.  See if any water runs out.

  Last, try squirting some WD-40 into the connector  on the unit.  Use a
liberal amount, while holding the unit so the excess can run out on the
ground.  This will flush any possibly conductive dirt out of the connector.
 When I worked for the phone company, we would cure water intrusion
problems on terminal blocks in the field by the simple expedient of
drowning them in WD-40.  I have actually watched the test board ohmmeter go
from a few hundred ohms to infinity as the guy in the field was spraying. 
Don't forget to do a visual inspection of both connectors for metallic
debris that could short the pins together. 

  If all these steps fail, then your unit has an internal winding to case
short (two of them actually, since both windings seem to be affected) and
will have to be replaced.


> I bought the current sensor a few months ago brand new ,it worked
perfectly for 2k miles ,
> then the rich erratic running started. 

  Don't forget to check to see if the unit is still in warranty!  Even if
it is just out, cry on your supplier's shoulder; he may make you a deal on
a new one.

								Jim T.
