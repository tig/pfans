Wow!  This sounds exactly like my situation about a year ago.  I had
just purchased my 914, and it had just received a rebuild as well.  When
I picked the car up, it had 500 miles on the rebuild.  At the 1500 mile
point, my compression was down to 70 psi at all four cylinders, and a
leak down revealed nothing better than 22% on any of the four cylinders.
 Mine too was leaking past the rings (you could see vapor rise out of
the filler).  I carefully took the engine apart, assuming that the rings
were lined up incorrectly, only to discover that they were lined up
perfectly.  To this day I don't  know what actually caused my engine to
do this.  The two best theories were that it suffered a rich-running
condition that washed the cylinders down and ruined the seal, and that
the rings just never had a chance to seal properly (which I don't
completely buy).  If you've been using synthetic oil in your engine, I'd
stop immediately.  I wouldn't even consider starting the use of
synthetic until the engine has at least 3000-5000 miles on it.  During
my top-end rebuild, I switched to Total Seal rings and re-honed the
cylinders.  The last time I did a compression check was when my valve
seat dropped, and at that point I was reading about 120psi on all four.
I never had a chance to do a leak down, but I'm hoping that the low
readings were do in part to my altitude (~6000ft) and the dropped
seat(s).  Based on my (very limited) experience, I'd switch to Total
Seals.  I can't see anything wrong with a 1-2% leakdown, but I'd like to
hear what others have to say.
