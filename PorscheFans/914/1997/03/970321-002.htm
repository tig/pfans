No, we have had the kit for over nine years! It has been common knowledge
among the 914 racers for years.  We got the idea long ago from one of them,
Ken Price in Australia (where very few 914s exist so they have to
improvise), and we give him all of the credit!
   The BMW calipers are available new for $150.00 each and directly bolt on
the early cars.  73-76 models require shaving of the mounting loops to a
cast mark clearly visable on the caliper.  It's that simple.  The pad is
911s size and with the addition of some carbon kevlar or the new Kelated
(sp?) brake pads, tremendous 914 braking can be achieved with very little
investment!
