Greetings 914-er's!

  Trying to keep some of the oil in the crankcase where it belongs, so I
have the engine apart again to find out why compression is so low in #4 and
why there is so much oil getting past the rings.
  When I first took it apart, I thought Ah-Ha!  There is an obvious huge
gap between the piston and the cylinder wall; about .025".  I could
actually see the rings by looking down past the piston.  I thought to
myself, "No wonder this thing burns oil!".  However, when I got things
further apart, I found that all of the cylinders, even those that have good
compression have similar clearances.

  Now, the funny thing is, this is NOT due to wear on the barrels!  They
are right on spec at 94 mm with no apreciable ridges or asymetric wear, and
the hone marks are even still visible!  The pistons are pretty close if one
measures across the "tabs" that form the longest part of the skirt.  The
trouble is, the pistons are conical in shape, getting smaller in diameter
as one approaches the top.  The total change is of the order of .020" to
..025", depending on the piston and where you measure.

  Now here's another bit of info:  A friend of mine who is a pretty good
mechanic (although not a Porsche owner) says that air cooled engines have
tapered pistons on purpose, because of the expansion due to heat near the
top.  He thinks that this is of the order of .015" or so, and says that
..025" may be a bit much.  Both my Haynes book and my technical specs
booklet from Performance Products agree that the cylinder clearance limit
is .008" (max wear limit) and that new it is permissable to be slightly
under .001"!  Neither book states WHERE to measure the piston-to-bore
clearance, however, and neither book has anything to say on the subject of
conality$%^ conicity@#$  ... oh heck, you know what I mean... the variation
in piston diameter from top to bottom.

  Question:  Has anyone out there run into anything like this before?  How
much variation in piston diameter should there be, and where should the
diameter be measured?  Does anyone have a known good piston that he would
be willing to mike for me?  

  Any help and comments would be greatly appreciated.

					Thanks in Advance,
					Jim T.
