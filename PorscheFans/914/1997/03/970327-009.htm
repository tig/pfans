No, before any of you get greedy, it's not my car!

Spotted in Boulder Colorado:

1974 914 2.0. w/appearance pkg.

now catch this, the owner claims only 8500 original miles!

I crawled underneath and saw only black original undercoating. Hmm,
maybe this is the real deal. The paint is the original silver, very
clean. Even has the fuchs spare wheel. The car is damn near perfect.
Then I poked my head in the engine compartment, well, the FI plumbing
wasn't original, and the ignition has been converted to some aftermarket
non-points system. But I guess that was minor, what troubled me was that
I couldn't find an engine number anywhere on the case. So as a concourse
car I doubt it would do well. Then I asked him the price, and he said
"15", I thought "1500!! Oh my! I'll buy it myself!". Good thing I only
thought it, turns out the guy is asking $15,000, HAH! I'm sorry, but I
have never seen a 914-4 for that much, even a concourse car. But it is
in fantastic shape and if anyone wants to check it out, it's at a place
called "Smooth Motors" in Boulder on Folsom. I make no claim to the
validaty of the 8500 mile claim, so buyer beware. It is a '74 914-4 and
it has 2.0 badging, very little underbody wear, great interior, and
D-Jet fuel injection (although the hoses could use some re-routing and
replacement). Oh yeah, it also has SSIs and a Bursch. It is really
really clean. If I were to judge it solely on cosmetics, I'd give it a
9.9. 1 tenth for a few nicks near the rockers, and that's about it. Not
even one teeny crack on the dash, I looked.
