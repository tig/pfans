Hi All.

I just found (and started using) a public truck-weighing scale at the
Texaco station at 176 Gateway Blvd, South San Francisco (about 2 miles
north of the airport, on the bay side). 415-737-9800.

This is a setup that has three seperate scales, and is normally used for
weighing semi-trailers (cab front axle, cab rear axles (2), and trailer
axles (2)).

So for a car, you just drive onto the scale and put the front wheels on the
first scale and the rear wheels on the second one, and leave the third one
empty. You call in from the scale and tell them to do the weighing. Stay
off the scale while they're weighing -- you can always weigh yourself at
home.

As far as I can tell, the scale has a resolution and accuracy of roughly 20 lbs.

It costs $6 per weighing, and you want them to weigh the actual (axle?)
weights, NOT the certified weights.  With the actual weights you get a
scale-by-scale breakdown, but the certified ticket just gives you the total
weight. The prinouts are different, the actual (axle?) printout being much
bigger and more useful. They seem a little surprised if you're not a semi,
but hey, it's $6 in their pocket.

I weighed my PCA TT 914-4 2.0 racer, and it came in, wet, at 2160lbs.  I
also weighed my truck & trailer and 914 on it, and was surprised to find
the total weight at 9900 lbs (!).

Anyway, while I can't vouch for its accuracy, it is a certified scale, and
is probably reasonably consistent, so if you just want to know the weight
of your car, or if you'r doing modifications and want to know how they're
affecting the weight, this seems like $6 well spent.
