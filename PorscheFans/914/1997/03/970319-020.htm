Better check your math again.  If you bought the cup holders at $375 each 
then 5 of them only cost you $1875 (if my math is correct).  Of course, 
maybe Uncle Sam got a hold of you and figured if you were buying 
cupholders at $375 each then you could pay him more also.  And I haven't 
checked your HP multiplication but it seems low for a 944 with such a 
noted gain :-).
