	There are a couple of other things to disconnect before you
drop the engine.  The clutch cable, the speedo drive cable, the two
heater control cables...  Disconnect all the wires from the relay
board except for the big T-14 connector toward the front.  And the
oil temp sender wire, if any.  And the two charcoal cannister vacc
hoses.  And....
	Basically, disconnect one end of everything that is connected
to both the engine (and tranny) and the body.  When you think that
you've found everything, take a 15 minute break and come back and
look over everything VERY carefully.  Then check again.

	About the clunking--check your driveshafts carefully.  I
drove with one that "clunked" only when I started moving from a dead
stop for about three days.  Then the outer CV joint disconnected it-
self from the stub axle, and mangled a couple of pieces of itself in
the process.
	One CV may be going bad, or it may just be dry (it will go
bad shortly if it really is dry), or it might be loose from the flange
it mounts to.  Whatever is really going on, it's probably something to
look into.
