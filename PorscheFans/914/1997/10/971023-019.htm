1974 2.0 liter green/black, 65K miles, garaged winters, Blaupunkt, new
battery. It was repainted probably 15 years ago, otherwise its all
original.
I'm posting this for the widow of the former owner, who does not have
Internet access. Her husband passed away and at something over 65, she
doesn't want to keep it. They weren't the original owners, but they have
owned it most of its life. I haven't seen it myself so I can't give any
more details than what she has told me on the phone. There is a paint
bubble in the door strike area, but no other visible signs of rust.
She's going to try to get someone to take a peek behind the rocker
panels at my urging. She's asking $3,000 for it. It's located in
central-Ohio. E-mail me if you are interested or have any more
questions.

Frank Miller
