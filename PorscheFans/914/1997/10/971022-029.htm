This was a brief conversation on teh national autox list today.

Person 1 (who has little or no knowledge of cars, but has gotten hooked
on autoxing with his Neon) is talking about the pros and cons of
autoxing with his boss who owns lots of 60's sports cars and stuff. And
tells him that he needs a dedicated car if he's going to be competetive.
So, boss takes him to his garage and showns him around a bunch of old
MGs and stuff and then..

And person 2 responds thus:

I'll keep you all appraised as this situation develops.
