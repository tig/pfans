STOCK BODIED 914s

Although the cars will vary slightly the space between the inner fender
and the outer fender is about 9 and =BD inches.  I have experimented with
15 and 16 inch wheels and can tell you the following:
=B7 Tire diameters and overall widths are different for each
manufacturer.  Do your research and find out the mounted dimensions
before deciding on a tire wheel combination.
=B7 The factory 911, 6 by 16 inch Fuchs wheel works well with 205/45,50,5=
5
series tires up front.  Ride height and alignment may restrict some
lock-to-lock turning but in most cases these tires will be fine.  5 and
1/2s in the 15 inch size will also be fine with these tires.
=B7 7 inch factory Fuchs will not fit the rear of the 914 without some
fender or trailing arm modification.  15 and 16 inch wheels will rub the
outer fender lip unless you pull the fender (don=92t) or narrow the
trailing arms.  I am in the process of doing this (narrowing the
trailing arms) to fit the 7X16 911 Fuchs in back and I will be happy to
let everyone how it goes.=20

Sadly the tire combinations are very limited for the 16 inch wheel and
tires that would fit the 7 incher nicely are limited to 205s and 215s.=20
Additionally only two major tire makers are building a 215 in a 16 inch
tire.  As much as I would like to mount a 225 series tire the thinnest I
have found available (Pirelli P7000) is 8.7 inches.  That leaves only .8
inches to split for inner and outer clearance.   =20
My suggestion would be to stay with a 15 by 6 inch wheel and use  205s
up front with matching 215s in the rear.  A good suggestion for tire
height is to stay above 24 inches unless ride isn=92t a concern.

GT FLARED 914s

Wheel sizes for Fuchs can be 8s and 9s if you want.  I like 7 and 8s and
7s and 9s.  The reason I like 7s in front is they are easier to move and
they provide adequate tire on the ground in a 45,50 or 55 series tire.=20
You can use a 245 in the rear with 9s and they look great.  A flared 914
with 225/50/16s (on 8s) up front and 245/45/16s in the rear is a very
aggressive looking car. =20
Good luck......Rich
