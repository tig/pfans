	Hmmm...  Drilling out the screws on the rear engine tin?  I hope you
have the correct screwdriver for them, otherwise they're a real PITA.  On my
74 2.0, I had to use the LARGEST (2 feet long) flat-head screwdriver that my
local Sears sells.  I wasn't sure it was a screwdriver, at first...
	Anyway, you push the throttle cable through the engine tin because
the cable stays with the body of the car (bigger PITA to remove it from the
car body than the engine sheetmetal) and the sheetmetal (engine tin, cover
plates, whatever) stay with the engine when you take the engine out.
	It's really a lot easier to pull all the "stuff" off the motor (FI,
intake, ducting and sheetmetal, etc.) when it's out of the car than when it's
in.  If you can raise the back of the car high enough, you may not even have
to pull the air cleaner off--though I've never been able to get the car up
*that* far on my own jack-stands...

	Good luck!
