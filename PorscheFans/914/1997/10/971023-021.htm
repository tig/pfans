	This sounds just like the problem I had earlier this year.
Charging volts less than 14, but high enough not to turn the red light
on.  First it was a loose belt, then it was the voltage regulator turned
down too far.  It would sustain itself (barely) while running, but eventually
the battery would die.  I thought it was a high starter load problem because
the starter would turn ever so slowly.  I wouldn't get that "ick-click"
then silence like when most batteries die.  I decided It wasn't a load broblwhen the car would start right up with jumper cables without the other car
running.  If you saw my cables, you'd know they aren't capable of supplying
much current.  So I bought a new battery anyway.  Ran great for a week until
the life was drawn out  of it.  Same symptoms.  I don't have a voltage regulator
in the car.  If I did, It wouldn't have gone on so long.

	On the other hand.  I do have a continuous symptom where I can hear
the solenoid dropping out and picking up repeatedly during cranking.  It's
as if the voltage drops low enough on the comperssion strokes, solenoid opens,
the hold resistor is taken out of the circuit, picks back up and repeats or
the voltage comes back up, the coil picks back up and repeats.  I think a
supplemental relay might help here or a new start switch or a rewire of
the starter so that the solenoid hold feature is bypassed.
