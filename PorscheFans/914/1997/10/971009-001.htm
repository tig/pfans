Not that anybody really gives a rat's butt, but I autocrossed for the
first time since re-installing the FI on my 74 2.0 and here's what I
observed:

The last time I autocrossed was at Parade here in San Antonio.  My times
(with dual Weber 44 IDFs) were a very consistant 70.5, 70.6 and 72.6 (1
cone!).  Our local club set up the same course at the same place for an
autocross this past weekend.  Nothing else has changed on my car except
for replacing the carbs with the original FI.  My times with the FI were
69.6, 69.8, and 72.0 (1 cone).

Now this says to me that the FI gained me nearly 1 full second over my
carbs!  Granted, this isn't a scientific test or anything (read: don't
start a flame war), but it does speak well for FI on a completely stock
2.0 car.

Oh, BTW, I got 21.5 mpg out of the tank of gas that I (and my wife)
autocrossed on (also included an 80 mile rally) - not bad in my book!
