>>yeah,

       I was driving home after a hockey game the other night when my car
just flat out died while I was driving.  I was just driving up the road
like
normal, at about 30 miles per hour.  The car started "bucking" a little
(I
have an intermittent bucking problem) and then the RPM's just dropped to
0
and the car started to sputter and then died.  I tried to restart it, and
it
restarted. I drove for about 50 feet, then it bucked a little and the
RPM's
dropped and it died again.  It would not restart after this.  What the
hell
is going on?!  
       Some things to make note of are that the trigger points have never
been replaced (the car has approx. 100k on it) and the old owner
disconnected
the throttle valve switch cause it was bad (he also tweaked something
else to
compensate for no  throt val swit, increased fuel pressure or something.
 When I connected it back up, the car misfired when I coasted in
gear-fuel
mix too rich-so I disconneted it).
       I don't know what the hell to do, besides tow it to the shop.  I'd
like to do something MYSELF to try and get it running again before I blow
a
paycheck on a repair bill.  Any one who knows anything-help me out.

Thanks,

Fuel pump, fiter or UMM you ran out of GAS.  Yes that is exactly how a
914 behaves when it runs out of gas.  Get a flash light and peer into the
tank you may be suprised, hate to say I have BTDT.  Yes I did fix my gas
guage, it was the tank float, but I still don't trust the thing.  

Take Care,
