I have found both hex bolts and Torx bolts on the CVs on different cars
(whether one was stock and one wasn't, or someone had just retrofitted,
I don't know).  In both cased, I found that I had to use a socket
(either Torx or hex) with a good size handle.

I found a penetrating oil at Pep Boys that is awesome.  The can is so
cluttered it is hard to tell the name, but I think it is PB Penetrating
Catalyst.  The can looks like a joke but this stuff works.  Used it on
engine sheet metal screws that I figured would have to be drilled out,
and within 15 miniutes I could loosen them with a standard screwdriver.
 It also had the same effect on the lower rocker panel screws...
