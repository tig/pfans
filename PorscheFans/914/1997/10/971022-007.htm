Thanks for the idea, Jon, but I spent three days last month working on
nothing but grounds.  None of them looked particularly bad to begin
with, but now they're all shinny, and all of the "just O.K." connectors
have been replaced.  That's the one part that I actually feel fairly
confident that I did right.  Is there a way to verify that I do indeed
have good grounding?

Thanks,
