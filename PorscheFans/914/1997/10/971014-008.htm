914ers,

I'm looking for a set of fiberglass flares for my 914.  I plan to attach
them to the fenders using Dusz fasteners for quick and easy removal and
easier access to suspension and brake components.  I know this is an
unusual method since I've traditionally seen almost the entire fender
replaced and attached with Dusz screws (lots of examples at this years
Runoffs at Mid-Ohio), but this is the route I'd like to take for now.
Obviously, this would also require a small amount of flat space around the
outer edge of the flares and since I've never actually seen a set of
un-attached glass flares, I was wondering if this is possible and if anyone
out there has a set they'd like to sell me.  If not, where can I get a hold
of some at a resonable cost.  They do not need to resemble the traditional
steel kind, just need room for wider wheels and tires (say 225's on 7" or
8" rims).

If anyone could get back to me about this, I'd appreciate it.  By the way,
this is for a Winter project, but if I'm going to be really competitive in
AP next year, I need more RUBBER!!!  

Thanks again,

Dion

ps:  The BFG Man at the Runoff's said a new R1 would be out for next season
and would be much more competitive than the current autox version   :)
