Yes. weak spark. Get a better coil.

Did you look at the insulators on the spark plugs for color? I remember last
time that you said 2 were regular tan and 2 were white, is that right? The
cylinder with the white insulator is running lean.

Could be, but it's carbon from running rich (or having a weak spark and not
getting good combustion).

lean hunt - bad head temp sensor, wiring, or ecu box.

It could be the ecu box, also. In electronics, sometimes a component goes
bad when it heats up, but is fine when cold. Does the ecu box get warm in a
particular spot when you're having these symptoms? You may not be able to
tell, and it's probably a long shot anyway.
