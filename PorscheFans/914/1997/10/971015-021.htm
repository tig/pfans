Well, it can't hurt to have replaced 'em though.

Let's do the basics again.

Air: Are there any obstructions in the intake?

Fuel: Are the injectors firing. Test them all.

Spark: Are you getting at least _a_ spark from all four plugs?

Compression: Do a compression test.

I know how you feel. BTDTGTTS

Don't give up! There can't be much alse to check, and wouldn't it be
great to get the car running before there's snow on the ground?

Is this the mechanic who you claim bothced things up or another one? I'm
still sceptical of the ignition system though.

Ok, and timing good?

Are you sure? Remeber the little wires in the connector _to_ the FI
points. If one of those is broken, you'll only fire two injectors.

Ok.

Which HT sensor? There are two different ones commonly sold. What's the
part number of the one in there?

Ok, so it's not a likely suspect either.

Wow! In a 914, that's an impressive accomplishment!

Wouldn't effect only one set of cylinders anyway.

Where was this checked? At the brain? I know that was one of your
problem areas, but that doesn't preclude the existance of any others.

See, here's the thing that confuses me. If it's lean, then the plugs are
going to burning incredibly hot, and will exhibit conditions that are
very obvious. If they're not firing, then they'll foul. Oh, you mean the
_injectors_ aren't firing. Check that little three wire connector back
there on the FI points. Really, it's just got three tiny wires on tiny
connectors that are subjected to repeated heat and motion.

Of course, you could always ditch it all in favor of a custom
programable FI system. It'd probably have cost you the same anyway... :)
