Hi all, I just recieved a pair of re-built 1.8L heads from Mark Stephens. I
have read alot about them on the net and in VW magazines. Someone even
referred them saying that they do great head work. Well anyway I open the box
to inspect my re-built heads and was pretty disappointed. The first head that
I took out has a section notched out of the combustion chamber. It is right
next to the exhaust valve. It looks like the valve seat cutter was in the
wrong place and cut a circular wedge out of the edge of the combustion
chamber. I measured the notch with a mic. and estimate that it would probably
be equivalent to .5cc. That would make cc-ing the heads a bit more difficult.
The real issue is that I cannot believe that a reputable service would even
ship this out like this. A bright shinny fresh machine cut mistake!! There
are various pits and gouges in the rest of the chambers, probably not a big
deal , but with this other problem it makes me question the quality of the
rest of their work. I called them today and the said to send the head back
with a note explaining why I don't like it, and that they will replace it
with another. They did not seem to want to refund my money and forget the
whole thing, although I would.I guess if they put these on their re-built
engines you'd never know it unless you took it off to look at it. Anyway I
guess I'll try the exchange, I'll specify one head without any mistakes.
Anyway , Am I over reacting to this ? Is the gouge not really a big deal? 
Thanks for letting me rant a little.
