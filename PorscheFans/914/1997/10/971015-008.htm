I installed my shiny new $70 trigger points last night, and.... nothing.
Still getting the exact same behavior.  I let the car idle for about 5
minutes while I hunted for loose wires and coated the engine in carb
cleaner, hoping to find some indication of an exhaust leak.  Nothing
again.  I pulled the plugs after the five minute idle, and sure enough,
I'm still missing something on cylinders 1 & 4.  The plugs from 1 & 4
were completely white - they didn't even look like they had been in the
car at all!  The plugs from 2 & 3 are a nice golden-tan.

Aaaauuugggghhh!

I'm not sure where to head from here.  It's starting to get a bit nippy,
so I suppose there's a good chance I'll have to park the car for the
winter and try again next spring.  I really don't want that to happen.
I'll re-cap what I've done so far, and maybe someone will have a little
guiding light:

1.  The car is equipped with a Crane Cams electrical ignition, which,
according to my mechanic, checks out just fine.
2.  The coil, plugs, plug-wires, distributor cap, rotor, and trigger
points are all brand new.
3.  The wiring harness has been thoroughly inspected and any
loose/brittle wires have been replaced.
4.  The manifold pressure sensor is brand new, and checks out fine.
5.  The head temp sensor is brand new, and checks out fine.
6.  The throttle position switch is brand new, checks out fine, and the
behavior continues with it disconnected.
7.  To the best of my (and my mechanic's) knowledge, there are no vacuum
leaks anywhere.
8.  The throttle body has been replaced with a good used one (my old one
was shot).
9.  My mechanic swapped out the computer without any change in behavior.
10.  All grounds have been thoroughly cleaned, and any shabby-looking
connections were replaced.

I'm sure there's probably more, but I'm not thinking to clearly right
now.  Here's a quick re-cap of the problem:

The car hunts at idle, and occasionally misses while driving.  An
exhaust gas analyzer reveals that the mixture fluctuates with the
hunting between 3% and 1.5%.  The HCs fluctuate between 800 and 1800
ppm.  Pulling the spark plugs reveals that one "bank" of injectors (1 &
4) are either incredibly lean at idle, or not firing at all.

If anyone has any suggestions as to how I should proceed from here, or
wants to forward this message on to someone that might be able to help,
please feel free to do so.  The only good thing that I can see right now
is that there really isn't a whole lot left that could be replaced, so
maybe the fixes from this point will be a little less expensive!

Thanks again for everyone's help!
