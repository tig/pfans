Disconnect the cable from the chassis, and attack the chassis with a
stiff wire brush.  Sandpaper the cable's connection, as well.  I just
finished cleaning up all of my grounds, and you'd be surprised how much
trouble just a little corrosion can cause.  Make sure the cable is
securely attached to the battery, and bolt it to the chassis with a few
washers and a lock nut to keep it from coming loose again.

Good luck,
