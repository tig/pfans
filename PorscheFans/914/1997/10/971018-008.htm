Yes they cost more, but they are more convinent to use. And, they're
generally more comfortable. A five point setup however will entail you
drilling a hole in the floor pan to mount the sub strap, and it will not
be at the right position when you use it. Get a double sub strap and
make sure it's LONG. Then you replace the regular lower seat belt bolts,
and use large eye bolts with locking latch mounts (where the belt
connects to the car, not the buckle). This way, teh belts can be removed
without undoing any bolts. And yes, they are perfectly safe. Ultimately
you'll want to get a seat. Try 'em on for size before buying. You want
it to fit right.

That's a matter of personal preference. I'm going to a smaller wheel
soon. I'm using a 350mm, but the new seat I have raises my legs too high
and the wheel just barely clears now. Some people hate little tiny
wheels.
