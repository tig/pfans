BTW - remember to put a jack under the motor - transmission junction to
catch it.

1.	disconnect the shift rod
2.	disconnect the positive battery line
3.	disconnect the throttle cable
4.	remove bolts holding brain and place brain on to motor
5.	disconnect and plug with golf tee the fuel lines
6.	disconnect ground strap on top of transmission
7.	unbolt 4 - bolts on motor mount bar & transmission mounts
8.	catch motor, Trans, & exsaust 
9.	have fun

Takes 60 min 1st time, 30 second, 20 from then on.

	Do you mean the engine tin when you say "cover plate"?

	You don't need to remove the engine tin before dropping the
engine. You do
	have to get the throttle cable out of the way however. All you
do is undo
	the for big bolts that hold the motor and tranny in the car,
disconect the
	CV's, and out she comes, simple. Some guys got the procedure
down to
	20minutes.
