I just had a fuse blow for my fuel pump.  I replaced it and it seems fine 
but I am unsure about the correct ampere rating for the fuse.  The pair 
on the relay board of my car are 8 amp, but the only information I have 
seems to indicate they should be 25 amp.  Is this true for a 1976 2.0?

Also, there was some discussion a long time ago about restoring worn 
throttle bodies.  I know the list member that was doing this is not any 
longer and as far as I know the other person who had a couple extra does 
not have any more (at least for the 2.0).  So, has anyone gone this route 
recently?  Do you know anyone who can do the work?  Any other suggestions 
for worn throttle bodies?
