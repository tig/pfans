O.K., enough of the snow has melted out here for me to get into the
garage and maybe even take the 914 out for a spin.  As we established
last week, my ignition doesn't appear to be working quite right (all I
get is a dim orange spark from the plugs).  I'm not really familiar with
the way it all works, so I was hoping that someone could give me a
checklist.  Basically, I want to establish what is working, and what
isn't.  Here's the current setup:

Crane Cams electronic ignition (no points!)
Brand new injector trigger points
Brand new Bosch Super Blue coil
Brand new rotor
Brand new distributor cap
Brand new spark plugs (NGK)
Brand new plug wires (cheapies, but new)
Battery is two years old, but appears to be fine, and all
grounds/terminals have been cleaned.

Let's assume that I've just bought the car, and I don't actually know
the condition of any of these components... how should I track this weak
spark down?

Thanks a ton!
