I have had YEARS of trouble free daily driver, autocross, and time trial
service from my 914 and now it appears to be getting even with me. A couple
of weeks ago, when I was changing back to street wheels after a time trial,
I noticed some rubbing on the inside of a rear wheel well. Closer
inspection at home showed that a rear suspension bushing was completely
gone. I replaced the bushings on a Thursday night and the car was fine
until Saturday. My car then tried to return to a part of its early
heritage. My wife and I were heading to a rally when a fuel rail hose
burst. It's amazing how easily a 914 will come loose in a slow speed turn
because of gas being sprayed on asphalt. The hoses were about 3 years old
and yes, they were the German braided type. A quick replacement of hoses
and all is well.

Well, those problems seem to be to easy to fix for my car. It had not yet
caused me enough grief to stop me from taking its reliability for granted.
I had in the past occasionally noticed a slight whiff of gas fumes when I
opened my car's door. My fuel pump and filter are in the front of the car
as in a ''75 or '76 and after I retightened the fuel filter the problem
seemed to be solved. Wrong!

The gas odor inside my car has gotten really bad this week so the obvious
problem is a lead inside the cockpit tunnel.  This has all the earmarks of
a real PITA job. I would rather not do my usual approach of creating a
larger fiasco than necessary so I look for your input. If you have done
this repair before:

Exactly where is the most likely point of the leak?

Does the tunnel have to be cut to get to the place?

What is the best approach to enact a permanent repair?

Thanks,

Ed
