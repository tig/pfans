    Steve:

    I've seen one... The guy ran a duct from the cooler up through
    the area where the gas tank used to be (he had a fuel cell
    mounted in the front trunk), and it exited through the cowl vents
    just in front of where the windshield would be if his car still
    had one.

    Note that this won't work AT ALL if you still have a windshield,
    since the cowl ducts are located where they are because the
    windshield produces a high-pressure area right there.

    Toe-in will help keep the car stable in the presence of
    crosswinds.  Another way, if you don't mind making huge mods to
    the bodywork, is to reduce the lateral area of the front of the
    car (e.g., by cutting the fenders down and giving your car the
    "slantnose" look) or increase the lateral area of the rear of
    the car... The NSX and the new Corvette, both of which are
    extremely stable at very high speeds, have that vaguely
    wrong-looking "big butt" for just this reason.

    Of course, your "drifting" may also be due to lift at the rear...
    If the numbers that Stephen Jacobs posted earlier are correct, a
    914 at 150 MPH would be generating about 400 pounds of lift at
    the rear.  Killing the lift with a spoiler or counteracting it
    with a wing might solve the problem better than toeing-in the
    tires or cutting off the front fenders.
