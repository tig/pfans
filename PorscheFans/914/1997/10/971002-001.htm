I installed the shaft collar and shims substitute for the spring and shims
between the rocker arms yesterday, just before deciding to remove the heads
:(

They look like they would be great, though. There was absolutely zero play
in any direction after installation, but rocker arm motion was completely
unimpaired. They had about the same resistance as the old setup, but that
would probably change as the parts wear in. I anticipate that there would
be a short break in period, after which they should have less friction than
the old spring setup.

So, is anyone interested in trying these out on a real, functioning motor?
I will give you the kit and instructions if you provide me detailed real
world information.
