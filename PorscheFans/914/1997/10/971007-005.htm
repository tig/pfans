Stosh had been out of work for close to two years. Needless to say, he was
getting pretty desperate for money. He decided to go to the wealthier
neighborhoods around town and look for odd jobs as a handyman. Well, the
first house he came to, a man answered the door and told Stosh, "Yeah, I
have a job for ya. How would you like to paint the porch?"

"Sure, that sounds great!" said Stosh.

"Well, uh, how much do you want me to pay you?" said the man.

"Is fifty bucks all right?" Stosh asked. "Yeah, that's great. You'll find
all the paint and ladders you'll need in the garage."

The man went back into his house to his wife, who had been listening.
"Fifty bucks! Does he know the porch goes all the way around the house?"
asked the wife.

"Well he must, he was standing right on it!" her husband replied.

About 15 minutes later, Stosh knocked on the door. "I'm all finished," he
told the surprised homeowner.

The man was amazed. "You painted the whole porch?"

"Yeah," Stosh replied, "I even had some paint left, so I put on two coats!"

The man reached into his wallet to pay Stosh.

"Oh, by the way," said Stosh, "that's not a Porch, it's a Ferrari."
