>Business Slogans Translated
>
>From "American Demographics" magazine: 
>
>Here's a look at how shrewd American business people translate their
slogans into foreign languages: 
>
>When Braniff translated a slogan touting its upholstery, "Fly in leather,"
it came out in Spanish as "Fly naked." 
>
>Coors put its slogan, "Turn it loose," into Spanish, where it was read as
"Suffer from diarrhea." 
>
>Chicken magnate Frank Perdue's line, "It takes a tough man to make a tender
chicken," sounds much more interesting
>in Spanish: "It takes a sexually stimulated man to make a chicken
affectionate." 
>
>When Vicks first introduce its cough drops on the german market, they were
chagrined to learn that the german
>pronunciation of "v" is f - which in german is the gutteral equivalent of
"sexual penetration." 
>
>Not to be outdone, Puffs tissues tried later to introduce its product, only
to learn that "Puff" in german is a colloquial
>term for a whorehouse. The English weren't too fond of the name either, as
it's a highly derogatory term for a
>non-heterosexual. 
>
>The Chevy Nova never sold well in Spanish speaking countries. "No va" means
"it doesn't go" in Spanish. 
>
>When Pepsi started marketing its products in China a few years back, they
translated their slogan, "Pepsi Brings You
>Back to Life" pretty literally. The slogan in Chinese really meant, "Pepsi
Brings Your Ancestors Back from the Grave." 
>
>When Coca-Cola first shipped to China, they named the product something
that when pronounced sounded like
>"Coca-Cola." The only problem was that the characters used meant "Bite the
wax tadpole." They later changed to a set
>of characters that mean "Happiness in the mouth." 
>
>A hair products company, Clairol, introduced the "Mist Stick", a curling
iron, into Germany only to find out that mist is
>slang for manure. Not too many people had use for the manure stick. 
>
>When Gerber first started selling baby food in Africa, they used the same
packaging as here in the USA - with the cute
>baby on the label. Later they found out that in Africa, companies routinely
put pictures on the label of what's inside since
>most people can't read.
