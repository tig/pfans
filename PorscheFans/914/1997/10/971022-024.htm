Ed,

    The spark plug hole can be "welded" up and re-tapped by a good machine
shop.  The same guys that are re-conditioning your heads should be able to
do this relatively cheaply.  They will also check for cracks emanating from
the spark plug holes which are much worse and sometimes impossible to fix.

Dave
