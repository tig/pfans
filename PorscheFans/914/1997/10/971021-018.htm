>Ben Watson - How to Tune & Modify Bosch Fuel injection

	I recently acquired the Watson book, and I personally do
not care for it.  He does have a couple of good things to say, but
I far prefer the way that Probst says them.  I also do not care
for his modification techniques.  (F'rinstance, for L-jet cars,
he tells you to get a different air-flow meter that has a lower
spring force on the flap, and then try to mess with things until
the car runs OK...  Yech!  He also seems to think that a rising-
rate fuel pressure regulator will solve every problem in the
universe.  That function is usually reduntant.)
	Probst's "Bosch Fuel Injection and Engine Management"
(published by Bentley Books) is a *very* well-written and readable
book, that covers most of the Bosch FI systems in use.  Lots of
good theory, some general troubleshooting and modification info,
kinda weak on specific applications.  Sadly, the D-jet info is
added as something of an appendix to the L-jet section, and refers
back to the rest of the section a lot.  So both must be read to
properly absorbe the D-jet info.

>Muirs - Complete Idoits guide to keeping your VW alive.

	A must have for anyone with an air-cooled car that has not
done much car work before.  Also nice to have even if you *do*
know what you're doing.  You just have to remember that some of
what he says doesn't apply to 914s--even some of the Type IV stuff.

	"That's my opinion--oughta be yours."    ;^)
