I think I got a quote for $76 a wheel here for 7 or 8 by 14". I couldn't
imagine that 15s would be much more expensive. And that's for just four
wheels. I'll call up the guy when I get the chance, but I think that's
the price. I may still do the steel wheel thing as the experiment. But I
recently came accross a very good deal possibility for some very light
3-piece custom wheels, and may go for those as an interim before flares.
Get the 15x8 (5.5" backspace) wheels now, and then when I flare, just
get the outer halves to widen the wheels. By the way, it has been
determined that this wheel with a 205/50-15 tire can just barely fit
under a stock fender. And I'd much rather have a 205 on an 8" rim than a
225 on a 6" rim. Eventually, it'd become a 225 or 245 on a 9 or 10" rim.
