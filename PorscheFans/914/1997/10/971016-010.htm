	I've been having an intermittent problem with my starter.
The symptom for a while was that turning the key to "start" would
result in no cranking.  Turning it to "off", then trying again
would cause the car to start normally.
	Then it got a bit worse.  Twice it failed to start at all.
I checked voltage from the ignition to the starter, and from the
battery to the starter.  I seemed to have ~12v (measurement was
tough due to the location I was in) in both.  Finally, I could
feel the solenoid click by touching it when the key was turned.
	After some discussion with Jim T and others, I came to
the conclusion that either my starter was hosed, or that some part
of the mechanical solenoid/motor/pinion gear linkage was not quite
working correctly.
	The cheap solution was to remove the starter, partly dis-
assemble it, clean and re-lube it, then put it all back together
again.  (Soren: "I've had starter problems twice; this solved it
both times!")
	Removing the starter is pretty easy, once you figure out
that one of the bolts unscrews from the engine side.  Disassembly
was pretty simple, even.  Two long flat-head screws hold the sole-
noid into the rest of the assebly.  Two more screws hold the motor
onto whatever is left.  You can also remove the nut and bolt that
are the pivot for the arm that pushes the pinion gear into the
ring gear on the flywheel.
	Everything seemed pretty clean (well, the inside did!)
when I got it apart.  Put a light coating of moly grease on the
stuff that would rub (but not on electrical stuff!!) and put it
all back together again.
	After that, the motor cranked slower.  Hmmm, I think when
I cleaned off the outside of the starter, I got some guck into the
high-current contacts.  Oops.  Well, at least it hasn't failed on
me, yet!  I may have fixed the original problem.  (Fingers crossed.)
	So today I pulled the contacts apart and sprayed them down
with carb cleaner.  I know, I shoulda used contact cleaner, but the
other was handy.
	Now the motor cranks a lot easier.  Of course, the alter-
nator light now won't go out...  Hmmm...  Good thing I have a
second car.  Finally, half-way back to work in that second car, I
remember that I had forgotten to put the wire from the alternator to
the starter back on--and that's how the juice gets to the battery!!
Duuuuhhhhh....
	I'll fix that one tomorrow.
