I'm not completely sure about this but I think the 968 has a timing chain 
rather than a timing belt. if this is so get a 968. water-cooled is the way to 
go and if any of you disagree --- guess what the factory thinks so too.
because the 1998 911 0r what ever its real number is --is water cooled.

the only reason I didn't buy a 944 instead of a 914 is for two reason

1 the 944 has A timing belt that  is recommended to be changed 30-45 thousand 
miles-- RIDICULOUS

2 the 914 was cheaper-- that is until I started to fix it

I guess the best advise is don't skimp and buy a cheaper Porsche or in my case 
thinking that a college guy "me"  is the shit if he spent  2900 bucks on A 
piece of garbage 914.
