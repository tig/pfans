I had a couple real  bad boys when removing those bolts.  Even with the
correct 12 point allen wrench type bit, pounded in place, some of these
bolts are in so tight so rusted , etc, that they just don't come out even
with a breaker bar - they strip out.  (Many unhappy noises heard from
underneath car)   Two suggestions, in case the other ideas don't work,
both of which will lead to having to replace the bolts (probably a good
idea since they may be stripped/rounded out):

1. Try gripping the outer round body of the bolt head with a good pair of
vice-grips really crunched on, then whack the vice grips with a hammer. 
(This even works on engine sheet metal screws that are rusted in and
rounded off at the screwdriver slot.  Replace the sheeet metal screws
with small stainless bolts.)
2. The ultimate problem solver is take out yer high speed (10,000 rpm)
right angle grinder (borrow or rent one) and grind off the whole head of
the bolt.  Once you remove the CV joint, you can then remove the bolt
stub left, with vice grips, etc. 
(You can get a grinder like this from some tool suppliers as cheap as
$30; Harbor Freight 1-800-423-2567, item #31135-7AVB.  With a couple
cutting wheels and grinding wheels you can do a lotta metalwork & repair.
 Put on a wire wheel or cup and you can strip paint & bondo right down to
clean steel.  Be careful, wear eye & ear protection.)

Kinda destructive, but effective, and bolts are cheap (any good VW joint
will have em').  I think the 914-6s used 6 point Allen head bolts as
stock instead.

Good luck!    Mike Tarter
