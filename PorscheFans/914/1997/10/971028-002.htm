All,
    I would add that you need new bolts anyway.  The suckers are somewhat
soft and stretch like alot of other fasteners.  New hardware and the proper
tool are cheap insurance against dropping a half shaft.  Besides, this is
one of the dirtiest, greasiest maintenance items on the car.  I don't want
to be doing it more that once or twice in my life <grin>.
Dave
