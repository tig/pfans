Hi Brad,

suggestions?

You can get the proper tool from your local Snap-On tool truck.  They know
it as a volkswagen C.V. tool.  Get the one that fits on your 3/8" ratchet,
its about 3-4" long. $20.  With a long-handled ratchet, it should be no
problem to break them loose.  They are supposed to be torqued to 30 ft#.

If this tool doesn't work, or strips the inside of the bolt, you can get
some
self-biting pliers from Snap-On as well.  These 14" pliers look like
channel-locks, only they have extremely short jaws, and "cam" into the
bolt/nut that you're trying to remove.  I call them my "oh shit pliers."

If you've got one or 2 really seized bolts, you can use a chisel and hammer
to turn them loose.  Get a 1/2 or 3/4" flat chisel, and whack the bolt
top/edge at an angle to "turn" the bolts out.  You'll need to buy new cv
bolts of course, which are avail from your local vw supplier.  Also,
somebody holding the wheel so that the shaft doesn't move is really
important too.  You really have to whack them hard, and anything that gives
will reduce the impact.

cheers, Brian Ng
