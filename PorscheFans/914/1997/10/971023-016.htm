That sucks!

Well, waht did you do last to change it? I'd suspect the coil. Get your
old one and put it back in, see if that changes anything.

Good luck! Today was my last sunny day to take the 914 out for a spin.
Good thing too, looks like snow tonight. Now that I drive Der Uber-Wagen
more often than the 'teener, I keep forgetting how much damn fun this
car is! I wish it had good heat, ground clearance, and 4WD. I'd drive it
all year round! As it is, the heat is marginal, the ground clearance is
minimal, and the RWD thing on muddy snow covered roads, as fun as it can
be in a light weight car. Is pretty scarry when you look over the edge
of teh road and only see trees 50 feet or more below to break your fall
if you should go off. -Sigh- at least there's still autoxing!

And I'm starting to think about those big wheels and tires again. I may
forgo the clean, prim and proper approach to flaring and just roll up
the fenders untill I can afford to have the flares done properly. 225s
