I have had a bit of time in this area.

The points are binary, that is they work or don't. There are two of them
and some times after cleaning the are not centered on the shaft. Pull
the dist. And use a meter to see that they are both firing.

Check the wires that they plug into, yes they get dirty and break.

Once you have the wires checked  you can use a low wattage 12v light
bulb (Flashlight style) to attach to injector plugs to make sure they
are firing.

If the injectors are firing, and you KNOW the trottel body switch is
good and properly adjusted, then I would have the injectors tested.

Most likely problem areas:

1. Points not centered
2. Wire cracked or plugs dirty
3. Trottel switch dirty or out of adj.
4. One bad injector (not clogged just wearing out)

	Does anyone have any experience with these failing?  When they
fail,
	what kind of behavior would you expect?  I'm still tracking down
bugs
	and trying to get the hydrocarbons down.  I installed a new
coil,
	replaced a few more shabby connectors, installed another set of
new
	plugs, and checked the resistance of the injectors.  Everything
checked
	out, but when I pulled the plugs, only #2 and #3 were
normal-looking.
	#1 and #4 were white/ash colored.  I hooked a timing light up to
the car
	while I drove it around, and watched it carefully whenever the
car would
	start to miss.  The light didn't miss a beat, so I assume the
problem
	has to be with fuel delivery.  I feel I did a good job on the
grounds,
	so the only thing I can think of that could cause different
behavior
	between the injector pairs would be the injector trigger points.
I
	pulled them (again!), and cleaned them up (they really didn't
look
	dirty) with a little sandpaper.  Once I installed them,  the
bucking
	went away for about 45 seconds, but quickly reappeared.  I
figure that
	since cleaning them actually made a difference, they've got to
be part
	of the problem.  I'm going to order a new set today, but I'm
wondering,
	since they look fine, if there could be something wrong with the
	distributor itself that is causing the points to behave this
way.  Oh
	well, I guess I'll just have to wait and see.

	Thanks again,
