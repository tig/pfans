  Here's a little humor for a Monday:


RE:     Porsche

Subject: out for a spin


 A self-important young man goes out and buys the best car
 available: a 1997 Porsche 911 Turbo. It is one of the
 fastest and most expensive cars in the world. He takes it
 out for a spin and, while doing so, stops at a red light.
 An old man on a moped (both looking about 90 years old)
 pulls up next to him.
 
 The old man looks over the sleek, shiny surface of the
 car and asks, "What kind of car ya' got there, Sonny?"
 
 The young man replies, "a 1997 Porsche 911 Turbo. They
 cost $100,000."
 
 "That's a lot of money", replies the old man. "Why does
 it cost so much?".
 
 "Because the car can do up to 180 miles an hour!" states
 the young man proudly.
 
 The moped driver asks, "Can I take a look inside?".
 
 "Sure, " replies the owner.
 
 So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks
 around. Leaning back on his moped, the old man says,
 "That's a pretty nice car, all right!".
 
 Just then the light changes, so the young guy decides
 to show the old man what his car can do.  He floors it,
 and within 10 seconds the speedometer reads 120 mph.
 Suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear-view mirror that
 seems to be getting closer!  He slows down to see what
 it could be and suddenly, whhhoooossshhh!  Something
 whips by him, going much faster!
 
 "What on earth could be going faster than my Porsche 911
 Turbo?" the young man asks himself. Then, ahead of him,
 he sees a dot coming toward him.
 
 Whhhooossshhh!.
 
 It goes by again, heading the opposite direction! And it
 almost looked like the old man on the moped!
 
 "Couldn't be", thinks the guy. "How could a moped outrun
 a Porsche 911 Turbo?" Again, he sees a dot in the rear-view
 mirror!
 
 Whoooosh--BLAMM! It plows into the back of his car. The
 young man jumps out. It IS the old man!!! Of course, the
 moped and the old man are hurting for certain.
 
 He runs up to the old man and says, "You're hurt bad! Is
 there anything I can do for you?".
 
 The old man groans and replies, "Yes. Unhook my suspenders
 from your side mirror."
