That would be FIA, and no they're not. There are a whole bunch of seats
that are sold that aren't FIA approved. Cobra, Corbeau, Kirkey all make
non-FIA approved seats. But the seats you're refering to are simply
plastic buckets (RCi is the name of the company that makes 'em), there
is no further structural support. And the "pads" are just that, pads.
Not really comfortable. But yes, if you really don't want to spend much
on a seat, and aren't too concerned with race safety, then go for it.

Oh give me a break. If I could afford the set of race tires I was drivng
on because I bought an inexpensive seat, I'd have no problem going out
on the track and spanking any gold chain dragger that felt I had an
"inappropriate" seat. Phagh!
