JJ and all,

	I just put a "new" engine in my 914 about a month ago.  The
engine is a new rebuild I have had setting on my garage floor for 2 years
but that is another story.  I used the coil from the engine that I
removed from the car.  The previous engine was running fine except for 70
psi compression on all cylinders.  Anyway, the "new" engine  never ran
well and I attributed it to not having the carbs (yes I know!) set up
right.  Last Saturday Mike G. (list member) dropped by and we had a go
with the engine.  The problem turned out to be the coil.  

	To make a boring tale short, JJ try a new coil.
