	Nope, no poking, no rocks--not even jelly-bean-flavored ones.
I was thinking about the same thing.  There's a lot to the starting
system.
	Jim T. had a great article on starter trouble diagnostics in
the forum on Tim's Fan Page.  Unfortunately, it was lost when the forum
crashed.
	In response to an earlier query of mine about starter troubles,
he sent me the first draft of a new one.  It is very strong on theory,
and contains a lot of information.  It's not quite as good with the
step-by-step instructions as the older one was, but you should be able
to get some pretty good answers after you've read it.
