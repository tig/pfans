pads?

	Hi there,

	I just replaced the master cylinder and can't find how to
	reset the brake warning light.  I checked Haynes to no
	avail.  I know this has been discussed before but am too
	lazy to look for it.  Sorry for the wob...

	If you have the 19mm 911 Master cynlinder push in on the
pressure scensor of the left side. (Where the wires are), and it will
reset.

	Also, I recall that someone on this list compiled a survey
	of recommended pads and the popular item was Repco/Axxis/PBR
	Metal Master.  However, recently I've been reading on the
	BMW and VW lists that they're pretty much against Metal Master
	and that the Repco Deluxe pads were the better choice.  Ferodo
	being more recommended.  Any new data/opinions???  

	Thanks in advance,

	--
