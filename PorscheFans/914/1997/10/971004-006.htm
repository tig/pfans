<Has anyone had any dealings with a company by the name Logicam?  I have
looked into there stuff.  Appears to be a good deal.  What would the =
hidden
advantages be to a hydraulic valvetrain?  I know the less noise and no =
more
valve adjustments.  What would be the purpose of the straight cut timing
set.  Would I see any advantages to that?>

I've got a Logicam hydraulic setup I bought quite a while ago.  It's =
going into my engine when (if?) I get to that point in the rebuild.  I =
haven't heard of them in several years, though, where did you find them? =
 I actually have a few questions for them.
Theoretically, a hydraulic lifter will compensate for engine expansion, =
and keep the valvetrain operating closer to the ideal adjustment than a =
solid lifter will.  With the combination of aluminum, steel, and cast =
iron (at least I think the cylinders are cast iron...) in 914 engines, =
there are undoubtedly some interesting things going on as the various =
parts expand due to the engine heating up.  Hydraulic lifters should =
help keep the valves in adjustment anyway.  The Logicam lifters have a =
flapper valve instead of the ball valves found on some other lifters, =
which is supposed to let them respond faster and not "pump up" at higher =
rpms.  I'm planning on putting in somewhat stiffer valve springs just to =
make sure they close when they're supposed to.  Hydraulic lifters also =
need more oil pressure to work correctly - a higher pressure pump and =
higher pressure or removed/blocked relief valves are needed.  I suspect =
(and hope...) that most of the problems people have had with hydraulic =
setups are due to older style lifters, insufficient oil pressure, and =
insufficient valve springs.  There are plenty of high-performance cars =
on the road that can rev plenty high with them.
