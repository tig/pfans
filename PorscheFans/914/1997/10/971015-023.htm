Depends on the pump. But that's an ok price. No experience with rebuilts
however. I figure that a fuel pump is a once every 20 years kindof
thing, so I didn't skimp, I got a new one. Also, have you considered
moving your fuel pump up front when you do the swap?

  Thanks Josh,
        My pump was moved to the front by the PO. Why I'm sure the pump
   is bad is because it squeels when it first starts running. Also, it
   doesn't always spin-up when the key is turn on. I found this by putting
   a meter on it to see if it got power for the spin-up. Then purely
   by accident I found that by slapping the hoses going into the pump
   I could USUALLY get it to work. (Found when I got stranded in 10deg
   weather and was a little irritated.)
             Well, on to buying a new (used) pump after a little more 
    feedback. 

             Thanks Again,
   
             Dave Trammell
