   More likely an open; it sounds as though your battery has come
adrift from your main electrical bus.   If things pick up above 2000
RPM or so, that indicates that the alternator is carrying the load
without being floated across the battery.

   I'd look for corrosion problems on the battery positive clamp
where the car source bus is clamped on along with the heavy cable to
the starter motor.   You should also look for corrosion / bad
connections around the fuses.  A voltmeter should enable you to see
where the bus voltage goes away.... do your trouble-shooting with the
ignition on but the engine not running.   (Disconnect the wire to the
points to save burning them if you are going to do any tracing with
the voltmeter... it will take you long enough that you will do harm
to the ignition components if that circuit is not broken.   Just
don't forget to put the points wire back on the coil when you are
through!)
