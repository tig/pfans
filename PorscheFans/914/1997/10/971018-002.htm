All I could suggest is that if the union of the base of the jug and the
case were leaking, you'd see oil around that seam. Yes, it's a pain to deal
with.

At idle, you should have a nice "sewing machine" sound. The high speed
clatter could be valve guides, as you suggest. They may not be so far gone
that you'd see smoke because you're probably burning most of the oil. What
do your plugs look like?

Hey welcome back to the fold, as it were. Join us on IRC sometime (#914chat
