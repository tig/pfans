Hi all, I need some tire size advice. My 73 now has steel GT flares and
7&8 x
15 Fuchs. I would like to run 225/50 front 245/50 rear tire sizes. I
like
Yokohama (pronounced "Yo' Mama's"  around here ) AVS Intermediates, but
the
largest available is 225/50. I have seen others use 205/50 front and
225/50
rear with AVS and 008's, But I really want 225 & 245's. Could I use
225/50s
on both the 7 & 8 in. rims? Any opinions or experience with BFG Comp
T/A's? I
need a tire that is good on the street as well as autocross. Long life
is not
expected or needed, just needs to be street worthy, this means okay in
the
rain.(A friend ran his 008's in the rain on the hiway, said they were
REAL
SCARRY!!)
Thanks,
Ed Villela


First of all, I would get some 16" rims. I wish I had. My 7 & 8x15"
Fuchs dont fill up the GT wheel wells enough. Having said that, I
would go with the BFG Comp/TA ZR, to get the 245s in back.I have Yoko
A509s, which I am very satisfied with. 225 is the widest in that tire,
in 15" rim. There is not alot of difference between the 225 and 245.
The biggest difference made will be how far out you can get the
wheels.You need to do some careful measuring to see how long to get
your hub studs, to use with your spacers. I use 20mm spacers in the
rear, and 23mm in front
