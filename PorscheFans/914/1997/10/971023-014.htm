	Crap crap crap!!!
	The car just died on me.  It got me to work, but has died
at lunch.  It seemed to be idling on only three cylinders, so I
pulled one of the spark plug wires off the plug (front-right
cylinder, #3?) to see if the idle changed.  It changed, all right--
the engine stopped DEAD.
	I put it back together, and cranked the starter.  Nothing.
Well, nothing except for a bunch of gasoline fumes.
	I pulled the center wire off the distributor cap, and held
it close to a ground.  I pushed the car around in 5th gear, and
watched for a spark.  Nothing.  Grrr!
	OK, two possibilities spring to mind--my Crane/Allison
optical ignition module is dead, or the coil I installed last
night is dead.
	I checked the resistance of the output of the optical
module (with the ignition on).  That's the wire that goes where the
points wire used to.  It read 10K ohms until I rolled the car
around in 5th gear.  Then it would fluctuate periodically, which I
assume is its way of simulating the points opening.
	I still wasn't sure if this was completely correct beahvior,
so I swapped in my old points and condensor (good thing I had 'em
with me!).  The car still would not start.  At that point I gave up
and walked back to work.  I probably should have opened and closed
the points manually to see if there was a spark, but I was tired of
messing with it.
	Tentative conclusion is that the new coil has failed.  I'll
try to confirm that tonight, or over the weekend.
