Hi all,

Well thanks to fellow list memebers I came up with the following source.

Williamettes Custom Wheel
1235 South East Grand Ave.
Portland, OR   97214
(503)232-8141

I just got off the phone with John out there, and he quoted me a price of
$43.35 per wheel if you send him the centers.  In each box you ship to
him include your return address.  State that you want this wheel center
built to which ever dimension you choose and your method of payment. 
They do except visa, and they will do the wheel paint it black and ship
it back.

Bunch of very nice people seem like they are pretty easy to deal with, I
did not get into work completion time frame since I have no more auto-xs
to run this year, so I have 6 months to get them back.  BTW, if you are
thinking un-sprung weight would be to much these will weight aprox.
25lbs.  The last stock 914 Fuchs I weighed was 19 lbs so the extra 6
pounds for 1.5" of wheel worth it.  If you break it down by pounds per
inch the rim width, steel come in a 3.57lbs/in. compared to the Fuchs
3.45lbs./in. Not bad since the Fuchs if offered in a 7" would have been
24.15lbs.  To close for me to tell the difference.

Hope that helps all you out.  I am looking at >$60.00 per wheel with all
charges shipping etc..

Take Care,
