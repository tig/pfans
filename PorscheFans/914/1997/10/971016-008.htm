	As many of you know, the GT/IMSA/SportsCar/whatever cars
will be racing at Laguna Seca Raceway the weekend after this one--
on October 24, 25, 26.  I've checked into the ticket prices, and
they're quite reasonable (compared to Indy/NASCAR/etc. prices).
	Tickets are available on the Web (http://www.laguna-seca.com)
or by calling 800/327-SECA.

Day(s)  Gen Adm+Paddock  G.A. Only
Fri           $10
Sat           $25           $20
Sun           $35           $30
Sat/Sun       $40           $30
F/S/S         $50           $40

	It's extra to get into the Turn 11 Grandstands.  On
Saturday, it's $5 extra; on Sunday it's $10 extra.

	I'll probably be there all three days.  Look for long
hair, glasses, and a green backpack.

I hope the list members can help me with two questions I have regarding building 
my PCA club racer.  I'm starting with a '75 2.0L.

1.  What have people done for brake ducts?  On my 911 I had ducts that carried 
the air to the center of the vented rotors.  What can be done for a car with 
solid rotors?  Where is the best place to direct the air flow?  Are there any 
kits made for this?   What about tying the ductwork into the air dam for the air 
inlet?  Where is a good source for such an air dam?

2.  Who makes the best adapter to plumb an external oil cooler?  I would like 
one with the thermostat built in if possible.

Thanks in advance,

Jim Andrews
