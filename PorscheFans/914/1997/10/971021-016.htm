Hi Dudes,

I have been away for 3 weeks on biz trip and then vacation.  I politely
unsubscribed before I left.  I come back and I find this thread running
about digest versus nondigest and some automatic assignment, along with
Dave's restrained non-bitch.

I find it ironic because I have been the subject of repeated involuntary
unsibscribe-without-warning scenarios.  I've always figured it's just the
cyberworld figuring out all of the glitches that exist in this new e-toy
they've created.  Anyway, I re-subscribed yesterday (10-20-97) in the
non-digest mode, and all is working fine.  One of the probs I had in the
last unsubscribe/resubscribe was that getting the posts in digest mode
was an impossibility.  WHY? because I'm on Juno and Juno won't accept the
digest type of a post.  So, I HAVE to take it in non-digest.  To delete
the non-digest mode would eliminate all of us with a Juno-type of server,
and I suspect that Juno isn't the only one that is that selective. 
That's my $.02 worth.

BTW many people responded to my statement about my thoughts on the
ethical practices of Juno.  I responded to each one personally.  My
opinion still stands, and I'm contemplating a change to Hotmail.  What is
that opinion you ask?  JUNO has been the biggest of e-rip offs for me.  I
made an order; was billed on my AmExp; NEVER received the goods; e-mail
posted and called their customer service dept. numerous times; was lied
to an equal amount of times; posted the Juno president (Charles Ardai);
snail mailed the same Juno president; and, have NEVER heard a reply. 
They have been absolutely stubborn in NOT refunding my money, and NOT
delivering the product.  BEWARE OF JUNO.  The e-mail is free, the goods
they peddle (or should I say, "pretend to peddle") are a sham.  Try
Hotmail, Eudora or some other free-e-mail if you are interested.

TAFN
