Hi Steve and Teri!

 I am rather late with this, but I gather that you are still having
the problem.

   I am not sure what you mean by this.   I am not familiar with the
'72, so I don't know whether you mean that the car is not so equiped,
or if you mean that the switch is missing from it's mounting hole.  
If the latter, then it is an error to assume that the circuit is
open.   If the switch innards have been mashed down into the cross
member, then the wire is quite likely to be grounded; it will be
necessary to fish it through and fit a new switch.   
   If the car was never equipped with an E-brake warning switch in
the first place, then you will have to open the circuit a piece at a
time, working your way down the tree from the flasher to wherever the
fault is.

					Good Luck,
                                                            Jim T.
