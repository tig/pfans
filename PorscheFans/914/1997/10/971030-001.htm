My car did not have any washers on it when I bought it and the 2 spare axles
I bought also did not have washers. Nevertheless, IF I were to use a washer,
there is a nifty wavy cup type from that awesome cataolg of mine, they are
said to be the best in high vibration applications. They are made by the
Schnorr corp and are called safety spring washers for use with socket or hex
head screws. Hardness HRC 43-48. They look like a bellville spring but are
wavy instead of being uniform. When flattened, the M8 size applies a force
of 3,360# to the fastener. Man, if that dont' keep it tight, nuttin' will!
There is also a ribbed spring washer that looks like a bellville spring but
has ribs on both surfaces. same hardness as the safety spring washers. Hope
this helps.
