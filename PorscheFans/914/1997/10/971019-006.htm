Hi Steven!

You wrote:

"  My tach is receiving an input, but all rpm movements are
compressed in a narrow range between 1k and 2k (indicated).  Have
checked ground and all other instruments behave normally.   Any
ideas?   "

 Most electronic tachs (and I believe that this includes the 914
tach) consist of a pulse integration network, a D'Arsonval meter, and
an operational amplifier to drive the meter. My guess is that either
the storage capacitor in the pulse-integration network has gone bad,
or the operational amplifier has (or possibly the internal voltage
regulator, if it has one).   In any event, this puts the problem
inside the tach, so unless you are good at disassembling instruments
and good at electronics repair, the best bet would be either a
replacement tach, or an instrument repair shop.

   If you decide to replace the tach, and you don't need to send back
a core, I might possibly be interested in your old one;  I like to
open these things up and see what makes them tick, and figure out
possible repair strategies.   Obviously, the best candidate for such
a procedure is a tach with problems; I sure don't want to cut up my
one-and-only working tach just to figure out what's inside!

   					Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
