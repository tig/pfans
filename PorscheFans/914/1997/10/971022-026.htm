'teeners,
    I have a nagging problem with getting the car started.
    - New battery
    - New starter
    - JJ's patented grounds cleansing completed
    - 13.8v across the battery
    - 13.79v from the positive battery terminal to the engine block
    - 1975 2.0L
    - Cables in good shape
    - 13v (approx) on the console voltmeter at 2000+ rpm

Car starts when battery comes off of the trickle charger.
I drive it for 20 minutes or so.
Turn off the engine and try to restart...nada, zip, zero, no starter.
12.4v across the battery terminals
12.38v from pos term to eng. block
Fuel pump runs
Lights are bright

    Question:  Do I have one of those weird 914's that Automotion talks
about in the catalog ad for "914 Starter Booster Kit"?  Is there something I
can do before I part with 30 bucks for this relay deal?  The car came to me
with a 1.8L and a "funny" (Audi) relay located between the taillights.  I
removed it from the car before I took it to the painter. Anybody seen this
(felt the pain) before?
Thanks for pointers,
Dave
