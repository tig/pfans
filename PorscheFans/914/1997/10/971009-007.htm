Initially, I thought, hey what's this air flow through the heat exchangers
all the time all about? Do I really need to draw off some air from the
cooling fan and have it blowing through the heat exchangers evern when I
don't need heat in the passenger compartment? Upon reflection, the amswer
may be yes. Let me explain.

Those Thermo-Tech guys that sell that nifty exhaust header wrap tape have an
interesting product. You wrap the exhaust to keep the exhaust temp's up and
the flow faster. However, after seeing a cast iron manifold glow cherry red
with that wrap on there, I have second thoughts. Also, a friend overheated a
cheaper tube header and it split. The upshot is that insulating the headers
has both good and bad points. 

In our cars, the heat exchangers surround the header pipes. If there is no
air flowing, then the still air will insulate the pipes, making them run
hotter. This can be good, as in better flow, et al. But, the downside is
that with a hotter exhaust, the exhaust valves of course run hotter. Burned
exhaust valves are the achilles heel of these motors, as far as I know. I'm
sure this is why the stock valves are sodium cooled. So, maybe the stock
setup ain't so bad, unless you're racing or have modified the motor to take
care of the extra heat problem.
