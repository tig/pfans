What Jeff Canaday said yesterday seems to be good advice to me.  However, 
new things can be bad too.  I would look carefully at the coil after 
checking the voltage from the Crane module.  I suppose that the optical 
sensor itself could be adjusted on the borderline of not working, but the 
fact that you have any spark seems to make the whole Crane unit less 
likely to be the culprit.  I would definitely check the coil very 
carefully, perhaps it is defective or just wired incorrectly.  If you 
disconnect the wires from coil (not the HT lead, which could also be 
defective) and then turn on the ignition, you should find one is a 12+ V 
and this should be connected to the "+" terminal on the coil (terminal 
15).  Haynes says you can check this voltage with the wire still 
connected and that the minimum voltage is 9 V.  Final thought, Crane 
ignition tech service is pretty helpful, but not toll-free (904)258-6174. 
 I recently installed the Crane optical trigger,along with the HI-6 and a 
PS-91 coil and it is amazing how much smoother the engine runs.
