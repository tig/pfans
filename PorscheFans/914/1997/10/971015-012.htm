To give you an idea;

My jack can raise things to 18 inches, and when it's fully collapsed,
it's 5 inches high.  When pulling my engine, I have to place a small 2
by 4 on top of the jack to reach the bottom of the engine, and after
collapsing the jack, I have to lift the tranny and remove the 2 by 4 to
get the engine out.  This is with the throttle body on.  So, I guess you
could say that if, when jacked up, the bottom of the engine is 20 inches
off the ground, and once you've dropped it, it's 5 inches off the
ground, then you'll clear everything.
