Steve and All;

I've been following the thread of responses where you wrote, "Intuitively
I can see how it may help to dump [the front-mounted oil-cooler exhaust]
through the top of the hood, but I'm not sure I'd want to cut up my car
like this. Has anyone seen any "pretty" attempts at this?"

There are several examples in photos, from crude to smooth.  Crude - just
chopping a hole and making a makeshift lip (there's a picture in the
Excellence Magazine that just came out, in the ad for Powerhaus of a red
914, that has this "look".  Smooth - anything you see coming from RUF,
pictures abound of stuff they've done.

I have an actual Kremer K-5 one piece nose (yes for my 14), which is not
exactly what you would use for the road, but I'm lookaing at road racing
& downforce applications.  However, I like to do 'glass work, and I
decided to make the nose COMPLETELY one-piece, to include the hood (and
it all tips forward on a hinge).

Anyway, I decided to go the smooth or elegant look for hot air relief at
the nose.  My solution, or as Damp Dave Darling would say, "My $.02"?  I
found the most-utilized local body-whiz who repaired the SCCA (at that
time Renault) now Ford Spec Racers.  He had a nose piece that was really
creamed and not salvageable to reuse, just laying around.  He cut out the
relief duct work for me, for a price of course.  Find a copy of SCCA's
SportsCar Magazine and there's sure to be a pic of a SpecRacer in their. 
'Glass being 'glass, I just worked it into my 'glass hood, with a little
trimming etc..

So, you could do the same.  'Glass is actually pretty easy to work with
once you get the hang of the time it takes to set up.  Hanging around a
local boat shop will sure to net you advice on how to work with 'glass.

Let me know if you want more details.  I might have to dig, but I might
come up with a close up pic of the detail of this reliefe spot.

My body work used to be in the picture column (right under Andy Warren's
Red Chalon 6-Beast) of the PorscheFans web page that Richard Ellis used
to do, wherever that went to.  Did those pictures and bios ever get
successfully transfered to another URL,  914 guys 'n gals?
