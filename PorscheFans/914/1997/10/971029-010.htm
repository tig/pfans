Spiral lock washers????????????  Not to flame but, I did not find a
Metric, or ANSI equivalent of what you described, nor any British form. 
According to my source if the washer ANSI External Tooth Lock washer, the
only application for a convex washer is for a counter sunk hole and
fastener application.  BTW this information is form Machinery's Hand Book
23  - Industrial Press, Inc.  If you have another source let me know I
would love to read it.

Never had a problem with the triple squares, but maybe it is the tools. 
I have one from a el-cheap of VW shop and I still paid $20(1978 dollars)
for the thing.  But it fits really tight!!!!  I have never stripped one,
and have never had problems torquing them down.  Using a cross pattern
and bringing the torque up to spec in small intervals. 

 BTW, why did Porsche and VW use this special bolt?  Answer, they are
easier to torque in place and reduce the likely hood of stripping due to
greater surface contact between the tool and the bolt head.

 No it is not to make you go out an buy a new tool, who needs an excuse
to do that anyway. <g>

And it is not to keep you out of the service business, if they wanted to
do that they would have built the head with a security pin, like the
Japanese do with electronics equipment.  Look at the bottom of your
Atari, Saga or Sony Playstation.  Yes you can buy that tool also but what
a pain in the you know what.  Lift truck companies are also notorious for
doing this same thing.  If you want to keep somebody from servicing your
equipment you can (will) make a bolt to do just that.  Lets hope they
don't figure out you can interlink bolts into a electronic net and make
sure you are a certified bolt breaker of Wada Wammputh Corporation. You
are not allowed to even turn a bolt with out a rectal scan, finger and
toe prints and 27 forms of ID. (Yes I did me rectal and not retinal. :-)

Take care,
