I am about to purchase a set of SS Heat Exchangers, early style, for my
'75 2.0. I have my choice from two different sources of complete
conversion stuff, including the misc. heater plumbing, hanger, &
mufflers from a real 2.0 setup or , presumably for significantly smaller
dollars, a 1.7 setup. The purveyor of the 1.7 setup is an independent
German auto mechanic of widespread and respected reputation, who has
told me that the only difference in the setup is the length and angle of
the primary pipes, and how they attach to the muffler. The diameter,
etc. is the same, and should provide equal performance to the genuine
2.0 setup; it will require the use of a 1.7  muffler.  My question is:
does the 1.7 setup equal the 2.0 setup for performance, my motivation
being to replace the convoluted, (and heavy) '75-'76 setup for better
performance with the lighter, better flowing, early style system, and
doing this right the first time. Also, any thoughts on peformance
aftermarket mufflers: which Bursh, or Monza, or whatever works best at a
reasonable sound level, and retains the stock valance.
                                                                Jim S.
