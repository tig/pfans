I noticed the notes from Dirk Wright, Dave Darling, etc. on mixing
hardware.  I mix a bit (example; I use non-metric stainless steel
hardware for the bolts, washers, & nutz that hold the muffler to the
exhaust pipes/headers) but I found a metric solution for the "rivet
nuts".

I used whats called a "self clinching nut insert", metric ones.  To
install these, ya drill a hole, position the insert on the back side,
screw in a screw or bolt with a washer or two on it, and tighten the
screw.  No special tools.  Now you have a threaded insert (I used 2.5 mm)
in the spot to attach your outer rocker panel.  I used a stainless insert
and screw to prevent corrosion.  The insert has teeth machined into the
section that crunches into the hole (the hole is 4.5 mm, for example) and
the steel and insert moosh into each other, which makes for a nice
mechanical mount.  I used 7 for each rocker panel, took maybe an hour
each side, including some "how dis gonna work??" looking & thinkin'.  
Now I can remove the rocker panel without drilling out pop rivets.  The
only limitation to using these is you have to be able to get the insert
on the back side of the panel.  Oh, the screws are 2.5 mm pan head
phillips (has a rounded head) metric 303 stainless.

(I work for a company in the fasteners biz, so I can source some cool
stuff.  I had to buy a box of 100 each of the screws & inserts, so I
gotta buncha these puppies left over.  If you'd like to use some of em'
send me a note and I'll part with a batch at what they cost me ($10??)).

For the most part, I stick with metric fasteners cause I can get metric
hardware at reasonable cost.  I luv metric stainless.

Hope this might be of help to ya'll.  Cheers!
