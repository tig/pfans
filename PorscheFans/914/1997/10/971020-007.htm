	Hmm, missed the original message in the change-over...

	Anyway, JJ asked how to set the timing without having someone
else in the driver's seat keeping the revs at 3500.  Here's what I do:

1:  Pull advance and retard hoses off the distributor.
2:  Remove top plug on fan shroud.
3:  Using 10mm wrench, loosen distributor clamp nut.
4:  Hook up timing light--two battery connections, one on #1 plug wire.
5:  Start car.
6:  Grab the throttle lever with my other hand and turn it in the "open
throttle" direction.  (I used to pull up on the throttle cable, but then
I broke the end of the cable.  Oops.)
7:  Look through the rear window to the tach until I can see we're at
3500 RPM (about 3500-3700, actually).
8:  Hold the throttle lever so that the engine keeps making the same
sound, aim light at fan, pull trigger.
9:  Realize that the "advance" setting on the timing light is *way* off,
curse and re-set it.  Repeat steps 5-7.
10: To change the timing, I let go of the throttle, then keep the trigger
down on the timing light, and twist the distributor.  I can see how far
I'm moving the timing that way.  Then repeat steps 5-7 to see if it's
really correct.
11: Turn off the car.
12: Tighten distributor clamp nut, put everything else together, clean up.

	Hmm, I just noticed that this would be a *lot* more difficult
if I hadn't painted the whole top of the fan blade nearest the timing
mark...  Well, hopefully it's still useable.
