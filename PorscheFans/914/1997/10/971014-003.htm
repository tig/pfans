	Dirk was correct about a carbed car not having vaccuum lines.  The
three you're referring to, however, are part of the PCV (Positive Crankcase
Ventilation) system.  They will spew oil vapor all over unless you do some-
thing with them.  (One recently popped off on my 74 2.0--it was ugly.)
	I will assume that you have a 2.0L engine.  The 1.8 is different in
many ways; I'm not sure if the PCV hoses are the same or not.
	The stock (with FI) arrangement for the two hoses coming out of the
heads is that they both connect to a "flashback valve" that lives up op top
of the engine, left-front, right up against the fan shroud.  I wouldn't be
surprised if it's missing on yours.  The two lines from the heads join at
this valve, and then one line goes to the air cleaner.  All three hoses are
about 13mm ID.
	For a carbed motor, you can join the two lines at a "breather box",
which should be available from various mail-order VW Bug places.  I think it
is a box with some foam filter inside it to collect the oil vapor, then a
drain to route the collected oil back into the motor.
	The other PCV line, from the oil filler, may be more of a problem.
This is another 13mm line that goes from the oil filler "box" to the mani-
fold.  I don't know how important it is to have this connected to engine
vaccuum.  (Hopefully someone else does.)  You may be able to get away with
routing this to your breather box--but maybe not...
	You can get a look at how the stock hoses hook up by checking the
vacc hose diagram under the Tech Refs section of Tim's 914 Fan Page,
http://www.estinc.com/porsche

	If you can find the time and $$, I'd suggest converting back to FI.
("Come, join us!  Be one of us!  You'll like it!" say the Pod People...)
There are several folks on the list who have complete (some more, some less)
FI systems to sell.  But then again, we *all* (especially Dirk!  ;^)   know
my bias against carbs.
