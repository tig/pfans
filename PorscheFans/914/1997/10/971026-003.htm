Allen wrench? Are the sockets on the bolts really allen sockets
(hexagon)? Or are you trying to use an allen wrench in the absence of
the 12pt wrench that's needed for the factory style bolts? They
shouldn't have been torqued extreemly tight to begin with. If I recall,
I think it was something on the order of 30ft-lbs for those suckers. IF
they really aren't budging, then just keep soaking them and try an
impact driver. If you don't have access to an impact driver, then place
a flat peice of metal on the head of the bolt and whack it with a
hammer. The idea is you want to induce an impulse compression to break
the bond, the metal is to protect the head of the head of the bolt so it
can still be used to remove it.

Good luck.
