The problem with the 914 starter is that the solenoid is triggered by +12v. If
there is anything less than +12v, the car will not start. This is likely if the
battery is even slightly weak, or the wiring is old (20+ years). The 911 starter
fixed this problem by triggering the solenoid whenever there is a non zero volt
signal (i.e. any small voltage). AA relay kit essentially makes your 914 starter
behave like the 911 starter by using the relay to trigger the starter which is
only requires a small voltage (~+3 volts or so), and then the relay passes on a
strong +12 signal.

Instead of investing in AA relay kit, you can just purchase a standard Bosch
relay for less than $5 (most car audio shops will carry these). They have five
terminals, and you don't need to use the middle one. (They are arranged in a
cross). Ask the shop you purchase it from how to wire it. It is very simple, but
would be best to see the relay at the time. Just explain the situation. You need
the relay to pass a +12 volt signal when it is triggered by another postive
voltage signal.

I mounted the relay to the back of the starter. One wire is grounded to the
factory ground location. One wire is connected to the battery +12v on the
starter (for the signal to pass), one is connected to the yellow wire that used
to trigger your starter, and the last goes to the starter to actually signal it
(your new yellow wire essentally).

Good luck. Sorry its not too clear, but you get the idea.
