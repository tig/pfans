It's been a while since I looked at this connector, but _most_ of the
electrical terminals in European cars of that era were made by AMP, Inc.
The terminal design dates back to the mid-fifties, but it is still widely
used (and copied) today. GM refers to them as a 56 Series terminal, I can't
remember what AMP calls them. You should not have any problem locating
replacements. The push-on type of terminals tend to be self-cleaning and
pretty reliable when they are new. Over the years, they do tend to relax a
bit, so I would recommend replacing over cleaning them. You probably won't
want to invest in the cost of the special crimping tool to crimp just a
couple of terminals (AMP has a special tool for just about every terminal
they make, and they tend to be pricey) so be sure to solder the wire to the
terminal in the crimp area after crimping it. I would also recommend
putting a trace of vaseline (or contact grease if you can find it) on the
contacts first before plugging the connector to improve and protect the
electrical connection.
