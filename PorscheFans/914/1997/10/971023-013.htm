Many people scoff at this idea of applying black paint for better
radiating of heat (to achieve cooling).

I'm a believer because I personally did some thorough tests while in
automotive engineering college back in the '70s.  You jogged my ancient
memory by bringing this up.

Just go ask radiator shops why they paint their finished products black? 
Some probably will have no idea because of the level of intelligence in
our society in general, but most will probably tell you the real reason,
and it's what you were alluding to in the first place.  Black radiates
heat the best of any color.  Red is a close second.  I don't remember the
results, but it is not a myth.  The color matters.  I do remember this: 
At the extremes - White reflects light the best and absorbs heat the
best, while black absorbs light best and radiates heat the best  So much
for a 40+ longhair memory.
