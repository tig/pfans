Just a note of caution to anyone who has one of the Brazilian 050
distributors, or is thinking about getting an 050.  The center shaft on the
Brazilian 050 is smaller than the German one. (please stop laughing)
Therefore the points replacement units such as the Pertronix and the
Compufire do not fit correctly without some customizing. Also, you can't
just swap the shaft from a 009, because it's shorter (but fatter). 

Anyway, I had been running a Pertronix Ignitor for a while, but the rivets
on the base came loose. I never like the way it didn't fit well inside the
dist. and required grinding the rotor, so I switched to the Compufire. I am
pleased with it. It appears to be better engineered (from a layman's point
of view).  I still had to fix the shaft on my 050 to make the unit fit
tight. A little JB Weld and some sanding made for a perfect fit.

Next I will try attaching a Crane Hi-6 unit. Anyone have pro's or con's on
this one???
