Well I made the leap and purchased a car.  Its a 74 2.0 with the appearance
group but without the sport group (this will be remedied shortly).  I
bought it from the original owner for $4500.  It has 75,000 original miles
and 5,000 on the rebuilt original engine.  New clutch too.  Its interior is
better then the 3 year old truck I had.  I have service records dating back
to 3-74.  Most of it is recorded in the original owners manual with
"Porsche-Audi" service stamps.  I had it looked at by Otto's and they gave
it a clean bill of health except for some rust in the rear trunk (another
thing that will be remedied soon.  I also plan on purchasing some
Revolutions, autox tires, front sway-bar and a harness for Solo2 duty in
Cal Club.  Im gonna snap some pictures of it and e-mail them to anyone that
wants them.
