If yuou're being serious here, then back off the cable adjustment until it
stops slipping.

The clutch "throw" has nothing to do with the cable actuation of the clutch.
You can limit the "throw" all you want, but you will not engage the clutch
unless the cable is adjusted accordingly.

The only reason I have found for the "stop" to exist is to make it harder to
remove the floor board (wood), and to keep you from pushing the pedal
through the wood.
