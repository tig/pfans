Does anyone have any experience with these failing?  When they fail,
what kind of behavior would you expect?  I'm still tracking down bugs
and trying to get the hydrocarbons down.  I installed a new coil,
replaced a few more shabby connectors, installed another set of new
plugs, and checked the resistance of the injectors.  Everything checked
out, but when I pulled the plugs, only #2 and #3 were normal-looking.
#1 and #4 were white/ash colored.  I hooked a timing light up to the car
while I drove it around, and watched it carefully whenever the car would
start to miss.  The light didn't miss a beat, so I assume the problem
has to be with fuel delivery.  I feel I did a good job on the grounds,
so the only thing I can think of that could cause different behavior
between the injector pairs would be the injector trigger points.  I
pulled them (again!), and cleaned them up (they really didn't look
dirty) with a little sandpaper.  Once I installed them,  the bucking
went away for about 45 seconds, but quickly reappeared.  I figure that
since cleaning them actually made a difference, they've got to be part
of the problem.  I'm going to order a new set today, but I'm wondering,
since they look fine, if there could be something wrong with the
distributor itself that is causing the points to behave this way.  Oh
well, I guess I'll just have to wait and see.

Thanks again,
