Hey folks.  I thought that the digest switch was just another "glitch"
encountered with the list.

So... I sent a message to subscribe@PorscheFans.com with the body "join
914".  The list software is smart enough to know that you were already a
list member on digest mode and switches you to individual message mode.

I agree 100 pct with Dave's comments below.

Best Regards,
Jeff (an Anti-Digest guy) Dunning
