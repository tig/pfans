Yeah, really!  We could make a bundle with a book, however, it would
look something like this...

   "... did that solve the problem?  No?  O.K., get a new throttle body.
Did that solve the problem?  No?  O.K., get a new throttle positions
switch.  Did that solve the problem?  No?  O.K., get a new manifold
pressure sensor.  Did that solve the problem?  No?  O.K., get a new head
temp sensor.  Did that solve the problem?  No?  O.K., get a new set of
trigger points..."

Oh well.  Here's what I'm planning at this point:

1.  Check the spark at on four plugs
2.  "Flow-Test" all four injectors
3.  Double-check the timing

If everything looks good on those three tests, then I'll do a
compression check to see if there are any problems mechanically.  If
that pans out as well, then about the only thing left to try is swapping
out the brain again.  After that... who knows?

Thanks again... I'll keep you posted!
