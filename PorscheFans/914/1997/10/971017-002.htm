Hello PorscheFans,

Although this is my first post to the list, I have already learned so very
much via the archives.  I have a recently purchased '74 2.0 L. that has
developed a oil leak that I need help with.  I have already replaced the oil
pressure switch and cooler seals which solved the passenger side problems.
I then replaced the push-rod tube seals (Viton), did valve adjustment
(verified TDC with impeller markings) and installed new cover gaskets.

With everything cleaned up, I now can identify a driver side leak.  There is
oil present on the thermostat (pulley is dry), cyl#2 intake pushrod tube
(all pushrod tube seals are dry), deflector plate and shift rod.  The valve
cover seams are dry and have found no oil on fan nor at exit flaps on fan
housing (?main seal ok?).  As best I can tell, the oil galley plugs seem to
be sound and there are no holes in the push-rod tubes that I can detect.
There is no oil-smoke exiting the tailpipe and oil consumption is approx.
1/4 qt./100 miles.

This leads me to the unions of heads to jugs or jugs to case.  Neither
appears to be very much fun repairing.  What else needs to be eliminated as
source and how to best approach the identification and repair?

In addition, after valve adjustment (checked 3 times) there seems to be more
"bottom" clatter then before and have noticed a "top-engine" clatter after
warm-up not detected earlier (suspect valve guides, but would I notice smoke
via tailpipe?).  Engine performance seems down a bit but I'm tweaking the FI
so it's hard to make proper correlation.

Sorry for  addressing so many issues in one post but it's been 16 years
since I've owned a 914 and have now tasted that thrill again!!
