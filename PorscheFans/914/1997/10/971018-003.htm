First, you need some software. Either mIRC for pc's or Ircle for macs. They
both have web sites where you can download them. Once you've installed the
software, you have to pick a server to connect to. Choose one that ends in
....dal.net. Of course, you have to pick a nickname, like BigDave. If your
nick is use by someone else, though, you'll have to change yours. Once
you're on the server, type in /join #914chat, which should make a window
pop up. That's it, you're on.

I had a good chat with dem last night. It's nice to talk live about these
914's! It's a real "get to know you" kind of thing.

Also, what's up with porschefans? What happened to the non-digest mode? I
hate the digest mode because it makes it real hard to reply to messages.
You have to delete all the others just to respond to one, and you have to
go and change the subject field. I hate that!
