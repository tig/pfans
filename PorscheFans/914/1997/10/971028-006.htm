	It's worthwhile to note that the "Allen bolts" used on the
four-cylinder cars (I thought on the Sixes, too, but I might be wrong)
are not actually Allen bolts.  Not even 12-point Allen bolts.  They're
called "triple square" bolts, or (to most VW and Porsche folks) "CV
bolts".
	An Allen wrench has six sides and six 120-degree corners.  The
triple-square tool is three squares rotated 30 degrees to each other.
The external corners (the pointy bits) are 90 degrees, rather than 120.
So, even if you find a 12-point Allen wrench (is there such a thing?),
it is still not quite the right tool.  This is one of the reasons that
using a regular six-point Allen wrench strips the bolts very easily--
you're already fitting a too-big extrusion into a too-small hole.  (I
*hate* when that happens!!!  ;^)
	Many people replace the bolts with regular Allen bolts.  I have
no idea if this is a bad thing or not.  I won't, because I figure there
was *some* reason the factory did it that way, and because I already
have the correct tool for it.

	I know this isn't any help for the person who asked the original
question, but it might be for someone who is going to do the job soon.

	Oh--general procedure for stuck fasteners:
1)  The proper tool.
2)  Lots of Liquid Wrench.
3)  BEAT on the head of the fastener.  (Protect it with a piece of metal
as per Josh2's suggestion if you think you may damage the head.)
4)  Repeath steps 2-3 once or twice every day for a week.
5)  Try the fastener again.
6)  Let it air out for a few days, then heat the surrounding material.
Try the fastener again.
7)  More destructive means.  (Vise Grips, slotting the head for your
BIG screwdriver, grinding the head off, etc.)
8)  Give up and take it to a machine shop.
9)  EDM.  (Electron Discharge Machining.)
