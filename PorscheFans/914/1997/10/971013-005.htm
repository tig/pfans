Hi guys I have a 72 with gt flares and a custom built set of 14" wheels to go
on it. The problem is the wheels aren't to my liking and I would prefer 15"
or 16" rims... do u know any sources. I called autoatlanta and they only have
one in the 4 lug pattern but it takes 3 months to get. Tweeks has a set
coming out in 2 months that looks like the 4 lug fuchs in 16 by 7 and 16 by 9
but they are expensive (about 450 each). Do u guys have any ideas? I don't
want to convert to 5 lugs and I would be willing to buy a used set if anyone
has them to fit the 4 lug 7 in front and 8 or nine in rear. Also do u guys
know how much I might sell my 14" rims for they are 7 and 9 wide.
Thanks for letting me ramble,
Ben
