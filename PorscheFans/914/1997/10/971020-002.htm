First off, I'd like to agree with Dirk about the switching of everyone
to the digest mode.  Not only is it a pain to reply to messages, but it
requires everyone to wait a full day to receive a response to their
messages.  I spend 8 hours a day online, and though I might be the
minority, I know I'm not the only one.  It's very helpful to be able to
send a message, receive several replies, respond again, and receive
clarification - all in one day.

O.K., now that that's out of the way - here's the update.  I was pinched
for time this weekend, so I wasn't able to do everything that I wanted,
but I was able to perform a few tests.  Due the to time constraints, and
the nature of my problem, I stuck to a single side of the engine, hoping
to see a difference between cylinder #1 and cylinder #2.  I started with
spark, and sure enough, I've got equal spark at each of the two
cylinders.  The spark was small, barely visible, and distinctly orange.
Is that bad?  I checked the resistance of the plug wires, and they were
all 110 + or - 10 Ohms.  I checked the gap, and out of the box they
appeared to be pretty darn close to the book's spec (which I can't
recall right now).  I then checked the fuel injectors.  I couldn't find
anything to use but a couple of small plastic cups.  After cranking the
engine for about 10 seconds, I could tell that each of the injectors
appear to be firing correctly.  The quantity of fuel in each cup was
approximately the same, and the spray pattern looked good, but I'm no
expert.  I didn't have a chance to double check the timing, but I did
notice something else.  The PO installed a fuel pressure gauge in the
engine compartment (that's why I don't have a cold-start valve), and I
noticed a little strangeness.  With then power off, if I gently tap the
gauge, the needle will indicate a pressure of 25 psi.  Once the car is
running, it will come up to about 28.  If I stop the car, it will stay
at 28 psi, unless I tap it again.  I think it's some sort of a mild
mechanical failure in the gauge, but I thought it warranted mentioning.
Basically, here's a quick description of the behavior (I tried to pay
close attention).

Starting with a cold engine, the car starts perfectly with a simple turn
of the key.  I never give it any gas, and you just barely get to hear
the starter turn before it's got the engine running.  For about 10
seconds, the car will idle perfectly smooth.  After 10 seconds, the car
will begin to "burble" - a little at first, then progressively worse.
After about 30 seconds, the exhaust will begin to spew what appears to
be steam (it's getting colder here), with little black "splotches" in
it.  This leaves a black splatter on the floor, which, when dry, is very
powdery.  I don't think it's oil, and the emissions don't smell of
anything in particular.  I think it's just the effect of my old rusty
Bursh slowly dying.  After about a minute, the steam and black
splattering disappear completely, and there is no visible emissions at
all.  At this point, I usually begin driving the car.  It will drive
wonderfully, with gobs of power, and no misfiring or hesitation.  When
the car warms to the point where the needle is about 1/8 inch away from
the "cold" mark, the car will exhibit an occasional miss when the
throttle is floored, however, if the throttle is gently applied, this
miss happens much less frequently.  Once the car is stopped and allowed
to idle, there is a definite hunting.  I have to set the idle very high
(~2100 RPM when cold) to keep the car from dying when the hunting
begins.  If the car is turned off for about 20 minutes, then it will
restart again just fine, only it won't hunt for about 30 seconds.  My
gut feeling tells me that if I can get the hunting resolved, the
burbling and missing will also disappear.  I really do think they're all
related.  I also think that the problem is somehow temperature related,
although it could also be linked to the closing of the Auxiliary Air
Valve as well.  Because of this, I don't think that it's something like
a loose wire or bad ground.  I haven't pulled all of the tubes off of
the wires yet, but I cannot get the engine's behavior to change no
matter how much I fiddle with them or their connections.  At this point,
I think my next step will have to be the swapping of computers.  If
anyone has any theories or recommendations, I'd be more than happy to
hear them!

Thanks again,
