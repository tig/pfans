Well, I put my car stuff on my sig when I send to one of the car lists
or car oriented folks that I know. Especially with some of the racing
lists that I'm on that have a very large "readership". This way, when I
discuss car stuff, people can read the tag and get an idea of where or
what I'm refering to without always having to say "I drive a ----". When
I send professional or personal (non car) mail, I ommit the car tags.
I'll usually leave the web address on there, but for professional
related mail, I'll ommit the web address too.

see, it's car related and I leave the car tags in there.
