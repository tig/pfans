I haven't checked the injectors for flow yet, but I have checked their
resistance.  Three of them were 2.5 ohms, and one was 2.1 ohms.  Could
that be a problem?  Also, the car drives good, it just misses on
occasion.  At least most of the time, all four injectors have to be
firing.  I haven't removed all of the tubing - maybe about half.  Is
there a particular segment that I should check?  Is there a suitable
replacement tubing?  Can you think of something that could cause one
bank of injectors to fail at idle, and intermittently while driving?
What do you think the chances are that I'm not really dealing with a
"bank of injectors" problem, but rather, just a problem that is
coincidentally failing cylinder 1 and 4?  Is there a way that I could
establish this?

Thanks again!
