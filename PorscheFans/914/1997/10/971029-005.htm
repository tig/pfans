My 914 is still saddly under a blanket, and was just a white lump this
morning. I need a garage!

Well, everything is new except one thing. Yup, the ignition box. As
Sherlock Holmes was so fond of saying... "Once you've eliminated the
impossible. The only thing remaining, however unlikely, must be the
solution.". Now I won't say that it's impossible for the new stuff to
bad out of the box (we've all been there at one time), but I'd say that
it's more likely that since you've replaced everything else to no avail,
the ignition box is suspect. It would be prudent to be as thorough as
possible. Namely, get some ignition points (they're really cheap),
install them and give it a try. At this point, what have you got to
loose?

Have determined that all four of your injectors are firing properly?
 
But the weak spark really makes me think ingnition. Your spark, no
matter whose box it comes out of, should not be orange and dim.
