I took a little 400 mi round trip today to pick up a bunch of pieces for
my '75 2.0. When I got home, I noticed that my son's car was not there,
and his motorcycle was pulled out of the garage. Since this has been
basically unused since he got a '73 1.7 for his birthday, I was
curious.  He told me that there was something"majorly wrong" with his
car, and that it was parked at the bank where he went to cash a
paycheck.  It wouldn't go into gear. I went to check it out, and it's
stuck in neutral, and the shiftlever wont move except to take up the
slack in the linkage. It's apparently locked up in neutral. The clutch
seems OK. Where do you start on a problem like this. The linkage appears
to be all right.  We'll tow it home tonight, but then what?
