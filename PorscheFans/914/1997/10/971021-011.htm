Yes, fuel pressure is very important.  You see the basic computer only
adjust the  on time (pulse width) of the injector.  Now it is possible to
get more or less fuel in the camber by changing the flow rate (pressure) 
Like if you where increasing the bore by 10%, you can crank the pressure
up 10% and get close to the same air fuel ratio.  And an L-jet actually
has a diagram adjusted pressure sensor.  Which changes pressure as
different things happen in the intake.  Kind of like a accelerator pump
on a carbed car.  You can also do the same thing on a turbo car  to
adjust for boast.  But remember an injector can only flow so much for a
given pulse width.

Fuel pressure can make a tremendous difference.  I had one that was
putting out 45 psi, and I was running way rich. 

 Change (borrow) the coil out and see what you get, or check and make
sure you have the proper orientation on the wire it will work either way,
but works best when wire properly.  Dry carbon is a rich condition or a
unburned fuel charge caused by weak ignition.  

Matter of fact when Chevy see this they say it is an ignition problem,
and not an injection item.  Part of that is becuase they use a O2 sensor,
but most of there systems are really close to D-jet technologies.  Just
another piece of trival knowledge spread out into the universe.  See
D-jet is not as antiquated as you think.

Take Care,
