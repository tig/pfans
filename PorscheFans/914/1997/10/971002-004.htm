Hi all, I need some tire size advice. My 73 now has steel GT flares and 7&8 x
15 Fuchs. I would like to run 225/50 front 245/50 rear tire sizes. I like
Yokohama (pronounced "Yo' Mama's"  around here ) AVS Intermediates, but the
largest available is 225/50. I have seen others use 205/50 front and 225/50
rear with AVS and 008's, But I really want 225 & 245's. Could I use 225/50s
on both the 7 & 8 in. rims? Any opinions or experience with BFG Comp T/A's? I
need a tire that is good on the street as well as autocross. Long life is not
expected or needed, just needs to be street worthy, this means okay in the
rain.(A friend ran his 008's in the rain on the hiway, said they were REAL
SCARRY!!)
Thanks,
Ed Villela
