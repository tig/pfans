OK guys 'n gals,

I'm gonna play dummy on this one :-)  [Andy, Dirk, Damp Dave D and the
other experts needed someone to poke at today, so I oughtta be the
designee this time).  I read the response threads regarding Dave
Condreay's question (which is tagged at the end of my post here) and they
all "group think" center around the solenoid (kit) / old wiring.

First off, I don't believe that Dave C has all of the data needed, and we
all may be applying a previously-known "fix-it" when there may be other
situations needing attention.  Dave's got _some_ good data, but NOT all
that's needed to make a GOOD application of a repair solution.

For instance, I thought that a voltage regulator was supposed to maintain
a charge (while running) of 14 or so volts.  This means that Dave's
static readings after running could indicate a faulty regulator or even a
weak alternator output.  The battery should not drop it's voltage-holding
ability that much, because it has deep-draw characteristics. 

What I'm alluding to is that a more complete collection of data could be
in order.  For instance, a "VAT 40" complete charging system check (which
includes full static AND running conditions, and starter draw readings to
name a few) ought to be done, don't ya' think?

What if starter-draw is excessive (just 'cos it's new doesn't mean it
can't draw excessively); the alternator is low in output;  diodes are
screwed up; the battery has a dead or dying cell (yes - even new
battery's have such things from being banged around in shipping); or, the
voltage regulator is limiting recharging at a level like 10 volts; all
leading to a poor operating battery and one that can't initialize a
solenoid properly?

These are all conditions checked in a COMPLETE charging system check, but
not supplied in this scenario.  Fuel pump running, bright lights are not
valid measurable symptoms to check to aid final diagnosis in this case.

Maybe I'm out in left field on ths one, and you guys have a pulse beat on
the specific problem, based on the limited data given.  But, I'd want to
have the complete data before I went off and randomly applied a fix that
worked for some guys, but may not be the one I needed.  Just a thought.

You may now throw rocks <G>  I'll duck with mouth open, because one of
'em may be those jalapeno flavored ones that were being tossed around
yesterday : - ]  Oh that's right, that was jalapeno flavored glue we were
talking about!  OK then, toss jelly bean flavored rocks instead.  Wright
and Darling get the first right to toss, have at it guys :-) :-) :-)

TAFN
Jebby  :-]
