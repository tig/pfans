I think my existing fuel pressure gauge may be a little screwed up.  It
doesn't seem to respond in an instantaneous manner.  For example, if I
disconnect a fuel line (dropping the pressure to zero), the gauge will
still read 28 psi, and will only drop down once I tap it a bunch.  Once
the pressure comes back up, the gauge will increase, but not in a steady
manner.  I had always blown it off as unimportant, but now that I'm
seeing that the fuel pressure could be blamed, I might need to go out
and get a suitable replacement.

Thanks for all of the help and suggestions!
