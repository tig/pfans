Fred,
    Just finished doing this on my car.  It's straight forward. It's alot of
work.  It's really fun if you're 6'5''.  It is doable and you would kick
yourself if you paid somebody else to do the work.
-  Remove the console (if applicable)
-  Remove the screws in each end of the dash (next to the doors)
-  Grab your 1/4'' 10mm swivel socket and extention and go upside down under
the
dash.  You're looking for nylon (or metal) 10mm nuts right up next to the
underderside (metal part) of the dash.
-  When you think you've gotten all of them...take a break...you haven't
gotten all of them
-  Remove the instrument bezel making careful note of any wires you pull off
the back of instruments.
-  Reach through the opening as far as the front of the dash and you'll find
two more 10mm nuts.
-  The dash, once 20 years of crust, dust, and yuck, are broken, should feel
very loose.  If not, you've missed a nut.
-  Don't lose the nylon nuts and washers.  It's far cheaper to re-use them.

Useful options...I removed the "knee knocker" (lower dash pad), seats,  and
steering wheel from my car and it gave me just a little extra maneuvering
room under there.

Also, don't do this job in August in Texas.  Man, that was dumb.
Dave
