Welcome to the fold, as it were. You appear to have the single weber
progressive setup. The only vacuum line you may have is the one to the
distributor, unless you have the Bosch 009 mechanical advance (somewhat
likely). There is no vacuum line to the oil filter or the cylinder heads.
When you start a motor with a carburetor when it's cold, a device called a
choke is in the closed position, causing the idle to be high. The purpose
of this is to allow the motor to warm up quickly. As the motor warms up,
the choke opens, returning the engine idle speed to a lower value. You
should have a at least one electrical wire attached to the side of the
carburetor, which powers the electric choke. The procedure is to start the
car, let it fast idle for a minute or so, then blip the throttle to
disengage the choke. The idle should drop. You're then ready to drive the
car.
