I have been reading the 924-944 list about how they can reverse the CV 
joints to get some extra miles out of them before needing to replace them 
(see below).  I'm curious, are the CV's on our 914's identical and can we 
swap them so they rotate in the opposite direction?  Any coments ?

|Yep, reversing the direction (end to end swapping) of a drive shaft is a
|time-honored
|method of extending the lift of 944 halfshafts...
|
|At least, I have been doing it for 10 years and have my original shafts in
|my 83 944...

|Good Luck!
