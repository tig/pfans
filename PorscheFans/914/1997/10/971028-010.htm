At the torque pressures required for halfshafts, allen head bolts are
perfectly acceptable, as long as they are the proper hardness.  Maybe
more practical as well, because it is easier to find allen socket tools
suited for breaking rusty/tight connections. You'd be hard-pressed to
find a CV bolt that can't be loosened with a 1/2" drive allen socket and
a 24" breaker bar.  These are available at auto parts stores across the
country.
