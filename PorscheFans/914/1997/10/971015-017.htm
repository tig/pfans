	The first time it took about a day each way for me.  I was
stupid and actually performed the book's step one (remove engine).
After I got it down to a science, It was two hours each way.
I probably couldn't go that fast now, I've been out of practice.

	BTW, how is the early exhaust on the 75.   I look at the frankenstein
arrangement on my 75 and don't know how much linger it will last.  
Seems that a decent exhaust for the later cars just doesn't exist
or is really inferior.  Might have to update to the earlier heat
excangers.  I've about given up on stock class.  B stock is a joke anyway.
