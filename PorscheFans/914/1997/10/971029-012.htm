Okay, I don't know what these washers I mentioned should be called, I've
just used them whenever I install(and reinstall, and reinstall) the
drivetrain of my 914. My father is a Porsche mechanic and he regularly
gets these from suppliers such as Metric Man. I've simply been
indoctrinated to use them and my best description of them are that they
are black anodized like the bolts, somewhat conical, and with striations
in a spiral pattern. They are somewhat like spring washers except more
specialized. I think similar washers are used, at least on 911s, on the
starter bolts and perhaps the other bolts to bolt together the engine
and transmission. Has no one else seen or used these? Okay, listing
three Porsches under my name seems a bit braggart(?) even if two are
inatimate and worthy of pathos. I just wanted to say what I have to hear
from owners of similar cars.
