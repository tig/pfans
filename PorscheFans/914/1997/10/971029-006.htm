Well all I  have gathered all the info I have which is still prety
limited.  But this is what I have come up with so far.  I can not find
any info on the 74 limited edtion cars with their spoilers or, any thing
on aftermarket spoilers.

Sports Car  Graphis used to include some basic aerodynamic information. 
Which I found suprising.  Due to the design of the front hood and fender
kind of skirt the sides I thought we would generate less lift on the
front, but I am wrong.

SCG test results:

model:	Front Lift	Rear Lift	Drag total
914-4	240lbs.	175lbs.	210lbs.
914-6	230lbs.	150lbs.	225lbs.

With the head lights up it added an extra 15 pounds of drag at 100MPH.

Of course there is the article in pano, now found in Up-fix Vol 5.

Overall Cd. is 0.363 and only goes up when you roll down the windows or
take the top off pop the head lights and the like.  But Cds really don't
do much for us except tell us we have low drag.

One other note of possible interest.  My current test with aftermarket
fuel injection show a consitant change in the air pressure of the engine
compartment and the speed at which you travel.  Since I can now data log
these items, it has kind of proven what some believe, presure does drop.
It is not huge currently, but hey I only got to 65MPH in this thing
durring testng.  Also adding an air kicker or wing to the roof, may not
be the best since it would create a greater negative presure zone in this
area.  Adding an air induction hood kind of like the Feiro Pace Car may
not look nice but it does allow for positive air flow.  GT-1 roof blister
anyone?

The addition of the front spoiler may almost half the front end lift. But
may increase rear lift to a certain degree.

Now if you are wondering, no I don't know if those little kicker tails
would help the rear lift, maybe, maybe not.  If you have seen any
pictures of "GTs" going down a long straight.  You know that we do need
help.  The GT hood is thin enough to allow for some aerodynamic
modification at speed. The front of the rear hood lifts a bit, and the
middle section bows in toward the trunk.  It may help, then again, it may
not. 

 Getting it down to a balance point would be nice.  Of course if we
generated down fource we would be much better off, find clean air, but it
is all a balancing act.  With total lift not exceeding 20% of the cars
over all weight we are much better off than say a beatle owner.  Or you
could add a bunch of road hugging weight and fell like you where driving
the most stable car in the world.  

Boy that would take all the fun out of owning a 914. <G>

Take care,
