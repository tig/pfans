yeah,

I have some sort of problem, I think.  Every few times, whenever I drive the
car, that I start the car off in first, from a complete stop, I hear a
rattle.  Its kind of a clunky sound, like chattering.  It lasts for a second
or two, then once the car gets going, it immediatly stops.  It sounds like
the driveshaft area.  I heard somewhere that if you hear a clunk when
starting from a complete stop, the driveshaft needs to be repacked with
grease.  Has anyone else had this problem before?  Is it just the drive
shaft, or something else?  (NOTE:  when I give it a lot of gas and let out
the clutch sorta slow, it does not make the rattle sound.  When I give it a
little gas and let out the clutch quick,  it almost always makes the sound)

Thanks,
