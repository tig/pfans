I wouldn't cap them!!  The case needs to breathe - that's why they did
it that way in the first place.

I got my breather box from SOCAL IMPORTS (310) 633-4979.  Cost about $20
and is a metal box about 3x3x6 with 3 fittings on it and a foam filter
inside.  I mounted it to the rear, upper engine compartment wall (just
under the springs for the rear trunk) with 2 sheet metal screws.  Use a
hose that is short enough to connect the box to the PCV on the oil
filler tube so excess oil will be able to run DOWN the hose, back into
the case.  The hoses from the heads go to the other 2 fittings on the
box.

This isn't a perfect solution, but it'll keep most of the oil vapor from
blowing all over your engine compartment.  And no, it isn't important to
have vacuum for the PCV (well, I've been running my 1.7 VW bus that way
for 7 years and my 914 was that way for 3 years until I got the FI back
on it recently).
