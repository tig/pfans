You know there are two things you can check real fast:

1.	Pull the connector to one of the two not firing injectors and
insert a 3 - 6 volt flashlight bulb in line (The voltage to the
injectors is low and has almost no power so you can hold the wires on
the bulb if need be or just wrap the wire around it to make contact.
		Then run the motor. If the bulb flashs you have power.

2.	If you have power pull the injector out (1 nut is all it takes)
and let it spray on a paper towel (with motor running). If you have gas,
check the valve clearance the input may not be opening.

	A rag, some leaves, a small tool, a small dead rodent. You name
it.

	That really should be done. Is there a more pronounced effect
when you
	pull 2 or 3 as opposed to 1 and 4?

	Don't let youself get zapped. Simple really :). Hold the plug by
the
	boot and touch it to a reliable ground on the engine somewhere.
Pull the
	fuel pump relay when you do this so fuel doesn't come spraying
out of
	the spark plug hole.

	You could have lost more seats. Not a good thing I know, but it
is a
	remote possibility. Don't worry about that unless _all_ other
	possibilies have been eliminated.

	Points? I thought you had an electronic system. So you _do_ have
points
	then. So what's this electronic ignition box thing doing then?

	The plastic connector itself is loose, so's mine, I don't think
that's a
	problem, nor is it a failure prone item. The little bitty brass
	connectors inside it are what I'm refering to. And yes,
replacements can
	be found.

	Then it's close enough for now.

	There aren't many left to replace. You've just about run the
gammut now.
