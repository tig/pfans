How low is your car? The easiest, not-radical modification I made to
increase high speed stability was to lower the front of my car and
additional .5 - .75 inches. I also have a slot in the front trunk cut
(exhaust air for oil cooler) and dump air to the bottom. Intuitively I can
see how it may help to dump this air through the top of the hood, but I'm
not sure I'd want to cut up my car like this. Has anyone seen any "pretty"
attempts at this?

Don't have a lot of cars to compare it too, but I've seen 150 mph and it is
fairly comfortable. My big complaint is "drifting" left and right which may
be caused by crosswinds or not enough toe in? Suggestions?
