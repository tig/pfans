   A good guess would be exactly that... either this wire or some
other one between either of the sensors (brake fluid reservoir level
or emergency brake lever position) and the flasher module.

   If I understand the diagram correctly, the diode isolates the
brake fluid warning switch from the line that goes from the E-brake
switch to the seat-belt warning circuitry.   As I said, I am not
familiar with how the '72 is supposed to work, but the connection on
the diagram implies that failure to release the E-brake will somehow
interact with the seat belt warning system.   The diode insures that
the low fluid level switch does not have the same interaction.   
   There is a solid-state block, #67 on the Haynes book diagram,
which is described as the "Safety belt warning light".   Obviously,
from what little is shown on the diagram, it is more than that.   It
has a terminal 50a which is shown as diode-isolated, and which is
wired in parallel with the emergency brake warning switch.  The use
of a diode on this terminal implies that it has a low internal
resistance to ground under certain conditions, and will pull the
brake warning flasher line to ground in the absence of the diode.    
If the diode on 50a has become shorted,  this could be the cause of
your trouble.   The only sure thing, however, is to isolate all of
the lines that are common to the flasher control line and reconnect
them one at a time.   When you connect the culprit, the flasher will
begin operating.   Trace this back to find the ground.   Note that
this involves a number of wires, including some on the back of the
instrument cluster.   If disconnecting the seat belt warning light
doesn't do the trick, you are in for a lot of weary messing around on
your back under the dash.   

   I wish you luck.

					Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
