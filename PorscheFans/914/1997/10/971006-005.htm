I have noticed that the male three-wire plug doesn't seem to seat very
tightly in the female plug on the trigger points' plate.  The wires
themselves looked O.K., but they could be corroded/broken inside the
actual plug.  The braided copper wires look a little dull, but they're
not corroded or broken.  I have checked the points with a multi-meter,
and they appear to be working fine, but that's only when hand-spinning
the distributor shaft.  How do I "center" the points?  I've checked the
resistance on the injectors, and now feel that I should mention that 3
of them measured 2.4 ohms, but one measured 2.1.  Is that too far off?
Other than checking the flow rate and spray pattern while cranking the
engine with the coil disconnected, is there a better way to check the
injectors?  If just one injector is failing, why would both #1 and #4 be
white?

Thanks again,
