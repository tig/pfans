Hello ed and 914fans, 
 I was just about to type out the same question about tires         
(see Ed's below) but with my 73 GT flared car will
have                   16X 8's &9's Fuchs and I dont know what size
tires to run either ??
Anyone one this combo ?? (GT flares and 16X8&9's)
Thanks for the help, 
 Don
