What I am wondering is why so many of you put the cars you own or hope to
own on your sigs?

I am just curious, I have never done it.  I don't even put  my
professional certifications, titles, and degrees behind my name. Not even
in a professional forum.  I guess I am just trying to figure it out.
Maybe I should, all my German relatives think so, it shows importance,
popy cock!  It shows I  have spent allot of time doing a bunch of
research and passing a lot of tests.

Knowledge is not knowing everything in the world - Knowledge is knowing
where to find the information you are looking for.

Take care,
