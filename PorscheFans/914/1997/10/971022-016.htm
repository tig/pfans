	The 19mm M/C and some of the 17mm M/Cs have a button
on the left side, with a rubber cover.  Push the rubber bump,
and the light goes off.  You can access it with the steering
rack cover off (easiest to see/get to).  You can also get to
it just by turning the steering all the way to the right.  Use
a flashlight, and possibly a mirror, and be prepared to get a
bit dirty.
	The other 17mm M/Cs re-set on their own.  Bleed, bleed,
bleed, bleed.  Then pump the brakes.  Hopefully the light will
go off.

	I did that at one point.  I was looking for pads for my
"other" car (yellow CRX; if one waves at you wave back at me!)
and the priorities were low-dust and rotor-friendliness, with
stopping power a little ways back.  From that standpoint, the
Metal Masters came highly recommended by Porsche folks and some
of the Honda folks.
	If your priorities are different, your choice of pads
can easily be different.  For my 914, the performance was the
primary thing, closely followed by rotor-friendliness.  Dust
was an issue, but not nearly as much.  I picked up a set of
Ferodo street pads for it, and have been reasonably happy with
them so far.  (Except for the squeak in the back that I can't
seem to get rid of.  Just about time to call in the pros on it.
It became a problem with my previous pads--stock Jurids--and
has not gotten any better...)
