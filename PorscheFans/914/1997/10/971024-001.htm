Hey everyone!
    Thank you for all the input.  I will be gathering more information on
the charging system this weekend.  Need to point out that I hit the wall
pretty early in the process of "what should I check next?".
    This list is a gift...sniff sniff...group hug.
    I can't wait to let you guys know how it turns out.  Thanks again.
Dave C.
