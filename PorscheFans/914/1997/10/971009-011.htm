Mike,

I knew I should have grabed all those I found in the bone yards, when I
was looking for a few injection parts awhile back.  Of course the easy
way out would be order a speacker grill from RATSHACK, and bolt it down. 
The big metal ones for a 15" driver should do it just fine.  Maybe able
to get by with a 12", only a tape will tell.  Or of course there is metal
mesh and a pair of tin snips.

Take Care,
