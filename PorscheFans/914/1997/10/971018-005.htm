Thanks to Nick Cole for selling me these 911 front calipers for my car. He
has a very nice car, BTW.

I can't find a part number on them. On one side it has a "16" and the other
looks like "664", both sides have "ATE". They also have spacers. Anyone
have any ideas? I measured the piston diameter, which is 42mm. The old oem
914 pistons were about 32.5mm. I'd say that's one heck of an upgrade! The
distance across the opening of the calipers is the same, however, which
means that I don't have to be concerned with the pistons falling out when
the pads wear down.
