For porsche914@loop.com and other interested parties:

You asked:

wire

   It is relatively straight-forward;  the relay has a coil, which
goes where the original headlight wiring went, i.e. it is between the
headlight switch output terminal and ground.   The relay also has a
pair of normally open contacts; these should be wired so that one
contact feeds the headlights where they were disconnected from the
switch, and the other contact has a dedicated high current lead
(fused of course) directly to the battery plus terminal.  The fuse
should be located in the engine compartment as close to the battery
as possible.   
  If the headlights are 100 watt units (each), then the fuse should
be sized accordingly.   I (current in amps) = P (total power in
watts) / E (system voltage in volts).   Remember that incandescent
lamps are near shorts on startup, so you need considerable overhead
on the fuse size, or a slow-blow fuse. I'd go with about 25 amps.
