(1) I'm still trying to track down my State Rep to get involved fighting the
new EPA regulations in Ohio which eliminates exemption of my 914 from smog
testing.

(2) In the meantime, I did have to go have my car tested.

First of all, according to the State of Ohio, there is no such thing as a
914!  The testers finally decided that I owned a Pors 924 with a
non-standard 2.0L engine.  

Since as part of the test, the testers drive your car on rollers (sort of
like a wheel dyno), I had to take 5 minutes explaining the "reverse-h" shift
pattern, and how they should be careful not to shift from first to reverse.
(Boy, I had the kid scared!)

Also, Ohio tests the pressurization of the gas cap.  After letting them look
for a while, I asked if they wanted me to show them where the cap is.  After
telling them they had to pop the front trunk lid, they gladly decided to
skip this portion of the test and mark me passed.

Well, here's the results -- for a 22-year-old car with the smog pump
disconnected, the 914 is the most environmentally car I own (including 2
fairly new Detroit cars).

Test Results - 
HC: (loaded) 27.9PPM (limit 450.0PPM)
CO: (loaded) 0.13% (limit 5.00%)
CO2: (loaded) 14.4278%
HC: (Idle) 59.0PPM (limit 450.0PPM)
CO: (Idle) 0.49% (limit 5.00%)
CO2: (Idle) 13.2782%
