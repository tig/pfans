yeah,

       I was driving home after a hockey game the other night when my car
just flat out died while I was driving.  I was just driving up the road like
normal, at about 30 miles per hour.  The car started "bucking" a little (I
have an intermittent bucking problem) and then the RPM's just dropped to 0
and the car started to sputter and then died.  I tried to restart it, and it
restarted. I drove for about 50 feet, then it bucked a little and the RPM's
dropped and it died again.  It would not restart after this.  What the hell
is going on?!  
       Some things to make note of are that the trigger points have never
been replaced (the car has approx. 100k on it) and the old owner disconnected
the throttle valve switch cause it was bad (he also tweaked something else to
compensate for no  throt val swit, increased fuel pressure or something.
 When I connected it back up, the car misfired when I coasted in gear-fuel
mix too rich-so I disconneted it).
       I don't know what the hell to do, besides tow it to the shop.  I'd
like to do something MYSELF to try and get it running again before I blow a
paycheck on a repair bill.  Any one who knows anything-help me out.

Thanks,
