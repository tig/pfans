Yeah, transistor technology was real flakey back when these were new.
Anyway, what's in the ecu, among other things, are two power transistors
that are the final amplifiers that drive the injectors. There is a resistor
in series with each output to each injector. A possible senario is that one
of the output transistors has failed or is about to fail, thus only 2
injectors working. This could possibly be caused by a short to ground that
was not addressed for a long time, causing the output transistor to heat
up, and/or the output resistor to fail. If I were JJ, I'd open up the ecu
box and take a good look around, notice any burned smells, etc.
