As another 'shipwright' afflicted I plan to use them when I finally get to
the head pulling stage.  I know Bob Hoover has a sermon about using them
for the VW engines.  I haven't had much luck tracking down any for the type
4 engine yet but not sure about the correct size.  I think the VW type 1
uses 7mm seals but the t4 valve stems are bigger but I'm not sure how big,
8mm, 9mm?

I had an email from one guy on the vw list who got a box of them from a
FLAPS once he know the size and could find a place that would bother
ordering them.  I was figuring on asking Mark Stephens since I'll probably
send my heads there when I get to the pulling stage.

So I'd do it if I was you.  If you have luck actually finding the correct
size, etc. please post the info.

OK, as a "shipwright's disease" aflicted individual, I got the dang heads
off, maybe I should install some valve stem seals? What's the word on these
things? The bimmer crowd all use them, what about us?
