Basically, that's it. the starter upper bolt is one of the four that
holds the tranny on. It does help to let the motor swivel down a little.
Don't forget the clutch cable. If you were going to be replacing the
tranny, you'd want to be extra careful pulling it out, as the front
seal, if old, is pretty fragile, and can leak if the shaft is banged
much when pulling. Just did this job last week, and although Brad M says
he can do it in an hour, my first time took about 3 hours each way,
being cautious, and undoing some stuff that hadn't been undone in a
while.
