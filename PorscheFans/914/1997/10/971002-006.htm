Hey auto-xers, and others

I have found  a company to make a small run of 7x15s with 5.25"
backspacing to fit our 914-4s.  Now these are steel since I have
determined that the Byods weigh like 1.5 pounds less than the steel
wheel.

If we provide the wheel center (must be straight) it will cost $70.00
apiece.  If he provides the centers it is $85 apiece, and need a total of
20 inorder to get that pricing.  If we have fewer than 20 wheels the
price goes up to $85 we provide centers $100 he provides the centers. 
Also there will be shipping on top of that and possibly sales tax since
he is in California.

If we do a group buy we all win, if we all piece meal them well..... I
don't like lossing the $60 on the deal, that almost buys tha textra
harness I had my eye on.  Of course if I compare it to a set of
Revolutions, well then I think I may be able to buy the harness, the
cage, and maybe a window net.

And Josh and other SCCAers I think we could also do the 7x14s in the same
run.

Also note: if anybody has any info on a place that will do it for less
please drop me a line.  

But in these parts, they have all dried up.

Take care,
