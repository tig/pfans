After some of my past postings, I'm ready for all the flames that will come
from you CA folks.

[Dion, please forward this info to Greg ASAP.]

Our smog loophole in Ohio's "smog counties" has officially been closed.  In
the past, we could register as a "collector's vehicle" any vehicle that was
not used as a primary mode of transportation.  The cost of plates was a few
dollars a year higher, but was exempt from smog-testing.  (creating a lower
total cost).

This year's registration has been returned to me with a note that
collector's cars are no longer exempt from smog testing.

When asked the benefit of collector's plates now, the Ohio BMV told me "none
what-so-ever".

I'm now calling my State Rep to lead the fight against testing.

Rgds,
Jeffrey Dunning
