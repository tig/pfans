JJ-
I once sold a guy with a '75 2.0 a brain for the same car. Seems he had
a problem with two injectors not firing and another brain he borrowed
solved the problem. It was definitely not the trigger points. So I sold
it to him, telling him that if my brain didn't work to bring it back and
I'd give him his money back. The next week he brought it back explaining
(if I understood correctly) that at first it worked, but after awhile it
was exhibiting the same problems. Almost sounded like a hot/cold kinda
thing. Excuse my ignorance here, as my electrical knowledge is very
limited and my memory is almost as bad, but I believe that the brain has
two diodes(?) that control 2 injectors each. I think it is not unheard
of for the brain to be exhibiting this kind of fault as electical
components like diodes burn out with age. I don't quite concur with
Automobile Atlanta's absolute statement that the 914 brains "never
fail", though I would say that it is rare. So I would check this out. At
least check the connections to the brain to make sure all the spades or
whatever they're called are tight and corrosion-free. Just my $.02.
