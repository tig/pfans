 Hey Mike,
    No flamers from here, BUT the ambient air temperature and humidity here
last week-end were "a little" different than during PCA Parade...weren't
they?
Dave
As long as I hear VROOOM, I'm okay.

>The last time I autocrossed was at Parade here in San Antonio.  My times
>(with dual Weber 44 IDFs) were a very consistant 70.5, 70.6 and 72.6 (1

>69.6, 69.8, and 72.0 (1 cone).

>Now this says to me that the FI gained me nearly 1 full second over my

>2.0 car.

>Oh, BTW, I got 21.5 mpg out of the tank of gas that I (and my wife)
>autocrossed on (also included an 80 mile rally) - not bad in my book!
