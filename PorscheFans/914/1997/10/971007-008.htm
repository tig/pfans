Big week ahead to put heads back on after rebuild!!!  Should any medium Locktite
(sp?) be used on any of the nuts during this proceedure? Should the rocker arm
shafts be turned upside down? Should I get some stainless nuts for the exhaust?
Are the little retangular flaps at each end of the airbox needed, I'm trying to
rebuild the small aluminum tips with holes for the flap himge with JB weld but
don't know how important it is? I have a rebuild gasket set from German
Restoration Parts but I'm not sure if it would include new o-rings for injection
tips or !!! even if such seals are used (I just removed the injectors and
wrapped them up in a baggie!). Does the Temp II opening in the shroud have a
grommet? Most of the grommets on my car were removed by the POM and its hard to
know where they should be.
I know its a long list but I'm getting hyper!!!  All suggestions greatly
appreciated!!
