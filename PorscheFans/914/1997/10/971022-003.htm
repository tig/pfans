In a message dated 10/21/97 6:16:59 AM Central Daylight Time, you write:

<< Misfire or Erratic Idle
 - Confirm basic engine, intake, and ignition systems are in good shape as
 these are the most likely culprits of misses at idle.
 - Inspect temp sensor I (intake temp sensor ) and temp sensor II (
 cylinders temp sensor).
 - Check trigger points
 - check MPS for leaks from the intake manifold to the sensor and that the
 line is not collapsing under vacuum
 - Do a flow test and look at the spray pattern
 
 If all checks out, you missed something basic, go back and check basic
 engine function.
  >>
Etc, etc.  Good stuff.

JJ, and all,
The OTHER thing to look at which hasn't been mentioned in quite awhile are
the grounds for the FI at the back of the engine.  Your problem sounds like a
classic ground problem; works fine when cold, and resistance increases as the
engine gets hot, and injectors connected to the bad ground cease to work. .
 There are at least 4 ground connections attached to one of the bolts on top
of the engine attached to spade connectors.  Take off each one, clean it,
squeeze the terminal together slightly, and put it back on.  Make sure there
is zero corrosion between the wire and the spade connector; if there is,
remove the connector, and crimp a new one on.

Grounds are the bane of a 914's existance.  If they aren't PERFECT, the car
won't run right.
