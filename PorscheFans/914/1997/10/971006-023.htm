   If I remember my metric conversions properly, one inch is 25.4 mm.
Therefore, 7mm is a bit larger than 1/4 inch.   Why don't you buy
yourself some 1/4-20 connector nuts (threaded bushings, or whatever
else the hardware store calls them), an appropriate size drill, if
necessary, and a 7mm metric tap.  Clamp the 1/4-20 goodies in a vise,
punch out the inside with the drill, and run the tap through them.  
Voila!  7mm connector nuts!
