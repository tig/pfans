	Whew!!  Thank goodness we're back--I was gettin' twitchy without
my daily 914 e-mail fix!   ;^)

	I didn't do any of these.  I've only got about 7000 miles on the
last of the head R&Rs, so it may be too early to draw real conclusions,
but I haven't had any problems yet.  (Well, not with the fasteners or the
rocker shafts.)
	Use the copper-coated exhaust nuts from GPR.  They sell a less-
expensive variety than the stock ones (something like 80 cents vs. ten
bucks!) which work just fine.  They also use a smaller-sized socket, which
is a real plus for me--I find it difficult to get the 1/4" drive 13mm
socket on some of those nuts...  Hi-temp anti-sieze is your friend, too.

	I have one of them on one side only.  (I assume you mean the flaps
at the bottom of the fan shroud where the ducts to the heat exchnagers go?)
Same problem on the other side--the place where the pivot pin would go is
no more.  I don't know how important these are supposed to be, but I
suspect that they're not critical...

	Ask them.  They're great guys, they like to help out, and they want
to keep your business.  Just call them up and ask if the injector seals are
included in the gasket kit.
	I wouldn't be surprised if they aren't, but they're really easy to
come by--your local Bubba's Bug World (or whatever Bug store) should have
them.  The same seals (same size and all) are used in the FI Type III motors,
and maybe even the FI Type I's, too!  Get them in pairs, the larger outer
one that holds the injector, and the smaller inner one that goes between
the injector and the intake runner.  You've got them out, the seals are
cheap, it's good insurance.

>Does the Temp II opening in the shroud have a grommet? Most of the grommets
>on my car were removed by the POM and its hard to know where they should be.

	Yes, it does.  The Auto Atlanta catalog gives the Porsche part
number for it (which can be used at the local dealer, BTW).  As far as I
can tell, every hole through the top-side engine tin has a grommet of some
sort.
