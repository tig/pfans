Sure would love to.  Lift at the front means exactly that the amount of
lift (force ) the air moving across the front of the car generates.  As
you have noted the 914 gets lighter as speeds increase in the front. 
This lift was measured at 100 MPH.  So @ 100 MPH you have a force that
picks up the front of the car by 175lbs or what ever it was.  Lift will
continue to increase with more speed or decrease if you back off.

Take Care,
