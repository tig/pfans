Hi J.J. !

   I have been following your postings on the list for awhile now,
butI have been too busy to put much thought into replies.   Every
time I think of something, I read in your postings that you just
tried that, which means that you are one step ahead of me all the
way.   

  I can think of only one other option, and that involves gathering
data that just isn't available yet.   I have a rough design for a
D-Jetronic test set kicking around, and maybe I'll have time to build
it over Christmas.   It will have provisions for connecting an
oscilloscope to the various points of interest, including the
manifold pressure sensor lines, the trigger point lines, and the four
injector outputs.   I will then have to gather data from my car (may
or not be a good standard) and preferably some other cars as well,
and then we can see what the injector pulse length looks like under
various conditions.
   Once we know this, it remains for you to beg / borrow a scope and
look at the pulses being delivered to your injectors, and then we may
have some idea of where to look.   Sorry I can't come up with
anything sooner or more definite, but that's the best that I can do. 
It is to be hoped that you will have your problem solved before then,
but if not, I will try to make the data available as soon as I get
it... but I strongly advise you not to hold your breath!   

  I wish you the best of sucess on finding your problem.   When you
do find it, you may well be the list's foremost expert on D-Jetronic
injection.  That ought to make you feel good!

					Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
