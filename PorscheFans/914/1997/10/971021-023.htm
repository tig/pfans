Woah! Something's wrong with your throttle there friend. The throttle
pedal is supposed to go all the way to the floor, that's where it
belongs! AT ALL TIMES! ;). But seriously, your throttle travel and
clutch travel should be similar.

BTDT-GTTS. I know what you mean. Before I installed my cobra seat, I had
the seat all the way forward and flat with a 1.5" felt pad behind my
back just so I could get teh clutch pedal (and gas pedal) to the floor.

You want pedal down to be just far enough to open the throttle valve
-all the way-. So what I'd recomend, is setting the throttle pedal where
you think you might want it, and then adjusting the cable at the
throttle body. Then go back and see if the throttle has enough room or
if you've pulled the cable too tight.
