I think the problem is no one makes what I would consider the best plug
wires.  No one makes a correct length set for the T4 2.0L that I have
found.  I'm going to make my own set, you could probably have this done if
you  want to.

I've got a set of MSD 8mm universal plug wires so I can make them the exact
length I need.  The standard VW type air seals aren't much good.  I'm going
to use the Corvair type air seals which are much better (see the Bob Hoover
Sermons on the net about these).  These  are like a large grommet that
snaps into the hole.  Since these weren't designed for the VW type engines
the holes in the tin aren't  quite right.  Either the grommets have to be
modified slightly (Hoover Sermons tell how)  or the tin holes have to be
enlarged (I plan to do this since I'll be pulling the engine at some point
to work on it).

I got the Jacobs wires with the OmniPak I put on my Thing.  They had
problems getting the standard VW type air seals on in the correct
direction.  They also permanently seal the wire ends on so when the VW
seals get old and hard you can't easily change them (the corvair type
basically last forever).  When I bougtht an Omni Pak from Performance
Products I originally called Jacobs about wires.  They said they didn't
have a wire set for the 914 and suggested the Firebraid? from Performance
Products.  Then I decided to get the MSD set and make my own.

I think Jacobs may be willing to make you a set. Or maybe Hastings.
