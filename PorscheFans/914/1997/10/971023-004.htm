Craig,

Of course they are reversible, what I do is swap them side to side this
reverses the direction.

Just follow simple directions:

1.	Mark the inner side of the shafts with tape or fingernail
polish.
2.	Un-bolt the CV-shafts from the trans and hubs.
3.	Take the left shaft and move it to the right side and install
with marked side to the hub (wheel).
4.	Repeat for other side (Yes you will need to drop them both
before reinstalling one.
5.	Toque the bolts back to18 # or what ever the factory setting is.

What you will get when done is the inner CV will now be on the outer of
other side or car. 6 months later you can repeat the procedure just
moving the marked side to the inside.

While I am doing this I usual PACK the joints with Mobil 1 syn grease. I
do this by just filling the whole joint and boot with grease.

I now have 140k on the current set.

Dan

	I have been reading the 924-944 list about how they can reverse
the CV 
	joints to get some extra miles out of them before needing to
replace them 
	(see below).  I'm curious, are the CV's on our 914's identical
and can we 
	swap them so they rotate in the opposite direction?  Any coments
?

	Craig Z.

	|Yep, reversing the direction (end to end swapping) of a drive
shaft is a
	|time-honored
	|method of extending the lift of 944 halfshafts...
	|
	|At least, I have been doing it for 10 years and have my
original shafts in
	|my 83 944...

	|Good Luck!
