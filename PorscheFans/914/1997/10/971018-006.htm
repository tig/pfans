I had a similar experience when returning from Peoria to my home in
Cedar Rapids this summer, It was August, 95+ Degrees and my car started
bucking and missing, wouldn't start at a gas station, Finally did, then
quit for good next to a goat farm that was mighty ripe and upwind. I
tried everything I could think of, and a little knowledge is dangerous.
Finally, about three hours into this, I went back to basics: fuel,
ignition, and compression. I replaced the points- still no, then checked
for fuel by releasing one of the lines to the injectors, putting it into
a empty coke bottle, then clicking the ignition on- Voila! no fuel. I
wasn't sure which relay fed the fuel pump, so I swapped them around one
at a time. Checked fuses, etc. Finally, I opened the acess port in the
trunk (mine is a late model) pulled the pump out, and checked for
voltage by putting a meter across the two terminals. The voltage was way
low, so I started really digging into the wiring diagram and going point
to point- everything checked out ok when I read from the + lead on the
pump wiring to the nearest ground at any point. I thought , what the
hell and gave it a try, varoom, it starts right up. Great,  What did I
do? Anyway I shut it down and put everything back together. Started the
car and got about 15 feet before it quit again. Shhhhhhucks. Started
over with tracking the problem down, and discovered that the fuel pump
ran when the access plate that the pump mounts to was pulled out, with
the pump lying across the sill at the back of the trunk. Turns out that
the ground side wire to the pump, the brown one, was not hooked to a
good ground. They use these little metal tabs brazed to the body to
ground through .250 faston tabs to the brown wires, and those tabs
corrode. Turn signals, headlights, a myriad of ground points all over
the car, all corroded, just waiting to make your life miserable. I
grounded the pump with an alligator test lead, it got me home, and I
have been on a little crusade to clean and protect those ground tabs
whenever I come across one. Anyway the message here is check the basics
before you start worrying about the more exotic elements of your 914.
Good Luck                                            Jim S.
