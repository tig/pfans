A potentiometer will INCREASE the resistance so if you're already
reading high, this won't help you.  You might want to verify that
there's not already a resistor spliced into the wire between the sensor
and the FI wiring harness.  My old sensor and my brand-new one (not yet
installed) both read about 2200 ohms cold (80 degrees ambient temp.) and
my old one drops as low as 75 ohms when (very) hot.  I installed a pot
and run it at about 500 - seems to work pretty well there.  If I
remember right, there are a couple of different model numbers for the
temp sensors for different years (I don't have any references handy -
can someone else verify/discredit that?) so maybe there are different
readings that are correct.
