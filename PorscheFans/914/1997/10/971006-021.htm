914er's
I have a 1976 914 2.0 ltr. I have been having problems with the 
engine flooding. Enough gasoline to shoot out the tail pipe about six 
feet. I have drained the oil and changed the oil filter. The oil 
in the engine had a lot of gas in it. I had to find a gas/oil waste 
disposal site to get rid of it. I have checked out the ignition 
system. Everything is ok. Car will run. I changed the temp sensor II 
(Head), I have changed the pressure sensor. I have also changed the 
cold start valve (5th Injector).When I had the engine rebuilt, I also 
had the injectors tuned. The gas injected by the injector is cone 
shaped.  Removed fuel injectors and placed injectors in four 
identical size glass jars. Cranked the engine and three injectors 
ejected the same amount of gas into the jars. There was one injector 
that didn't eject any fuel. I checked the end of the injector where 
the pin is, I could press the pin and the fuel would be injected. I 
changed the injector and the replacment injector worked fine when I 
performed the test again, each of the four jars had the same amount 
of fuel in them.  I set up a battery charger and connected it to the 
fuel pump. The fuel line was pressurized. The pressure is 30 psi, 
the injectors are not leaking. The cold start valve was disconnected 
both times I checked the injectors and when I started the engine.. 
There was residue left in the heat exchangers and muffler. I started
the car and blew most of that stuff out. This afternoon I checked the 
oil level and the oil is above the full mark. I smelled the oil and 
it has gasoline in it.I also run my finger along the dip stick and 
the oil is very thin. I run 20w50 in the car. Can this gas in the 
oil, be from before? I left the drain plug out over night to ensure 
that all the old oil and gas drained. Unless things have changed, 
fuel is delivered to the engine by four fuel injectors and the cold 
start valve when the engine is cold. The injectors don't leak. The 
injectors put out the same amount of fuel. The cold start valve was 
disconnected.   I guess it could have been the fuel injector I 
replaced. But it would not work when it was suppose to the spraying
fuel into the cylinder. But I guess it could leak. Anyone have any 
ideas.
Thanks
