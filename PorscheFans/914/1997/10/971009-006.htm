Yes glad it is back, I was starting to wonder. I tried resubscribing twice,
saw messages in the archive but nothing here.

Just wanted to clarify a couple things.  Those little rectangular flaps.
If like my car, you don't have the heat exchanger ducting back on then tape
them or the opening closed. Otherwise you have a big cooling air leak that
should be going to the heads.  I think there purpose is to seal the hole
when you have the heater blower turned on.  Then you don't need the air
from the impeller and it can all go to the heads.

I doubt the rebuild gasket set from GPR has the injector orings either.  I
have a gasket set for my 1.7L spare engine I got when Perfornance Products
had a 20% off sale and it doesn't have the injector seals.  It also has the
regular type pushrod tube seals.   I bought the injector seals and the
Viton pushrod seals from GPR to use on the 2.0L.  I agree that GPR is
great, I've bought a lot of stuff from them.  Only a couple minor problem
ever and a phone call cleared them up.  Also got their copper exhaust nuts
like Dave did, good ones.

Yes the Temp II sensor grommet looks like a standard hole grommet, with a
thin rubber membrane across the center.  You cut a small hole in it for the
wire.  These are the same as used on the VW type 4 and probably cheaper
from a VW FLAPS than from a place with the Porsche name attached.  I agree
with Dave, every opening in the shrouding had and should have a grommet or
seal.  Otherwise you're wasting cooling air.  The air in the shrouding is
under pressure from the fan so it is forced down through the heads.  ANY
other opening is a path of lower resistance and the cooling air goes partly
that way.  Sometimes you have to get creative, I'm still trying to find a
good way to seal around the oil pressure sensor. That seal is NLA.   I'm
adding a VDO extension hose and oil pressure gauge so think I'll try a Temp
II seal or something similar.  Right now duct tape works.

Oh I also discovered that the NLA rubber boot for the early FI pump
electrical connection can be replaced with the rubber boot for the back up
switch on the tranny.  Works fine.

 Whew!!  Thank goodness we're back--I was gettin' twitchy without
my daily 914 e-mail fix!   ;^^)

 I didn't do any of these.  I've only got about 7000 miles on the
last of the head R&Rs, so it may be too early to draw real conclusions,
but I haven't had any problems yet.  (Well, not with the fasteners or the
rocker shafts.)
 Use the copper-coated exhaust nuts from GPR.  They sell a less-
expensive variety than the stock ones (something like 80 cents vs. ten
bucks!) which work just fine.  They also use a smaller-sized socket, which
is a real plus for me--I find it difficult to get the 1/4" drive 13mm
socket on some of those nuts...  Hi-temp anti-sieze is your friend, too.

 I have one of them on one side only.  (I assume you mean the flaps
at the bottom of the fan shroud where the ducts to the heat exchnagers go?)
Same problem on the other side--the place where the pivot pin would go is
no more.  I don't know how important these are supposed to be, but I
suspect that they're not critical...

baggie!).

 Ask them.  They're great guys, they like to help out, and they want
to keep your business.  Just call them up and ask if the injector seals are
included in the gasket kit.
 I wouldn't be surprised if they aren't, but they're really easy to
come by--your local Bubba's Bug World (or whatever Bug store) should have
them.  The same seals (same size and all) are used in the FI Type III
motors, and maybe even the FI Type I's, too!  Get them in pairs, the larger
outer one that holds the injector, and the smaller inner one that goes
between the injector and the intake runner.  You've got them out, the seals
are cheap, it's good insurance.

>Does the Temp II opening in the shroud have a grommet? Most of the
grommets >on my car were removed by the POM and its hard to know where they
should be.

 Yes, it does.  The Auto Atlanta catalog gives the Porsche part
number for it (which can be used at the local dealer, BTW).  As far as I
can tell, every hole through the top-side engine tin has a grommet of some
sort.
