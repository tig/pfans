This is a subject area where some of us get a little wiggly.

Home Deopt doesn't have the right size copper tubing you need. You'll need
5/16 and 3/8, which are very close to the original. These are availabel
either at automotive supply shops or refrigeration parts wholesalers. The
supply line is thicker than the return line, depending on if your pump is
up front or in the rear. The 2 tubes coming out of the tank are 3/8 and
5/16 (actually whatever matric equivalent), so you'll need some rubber hose
in those sizes, too. You'll need a tubing bender, some unions, and maybe a
"T", depending on whether you want to use the original or not.

You'll have to remove the shift and the pedal cluster to gain access to the
holes and to release the metal tie down in the shifter tunnel. If you have
shipwright's disease, you could be in for a long haul....
