	Yes, Dirk--but I think you're looking at the question from the wrong
end.  DMER is looking to buy an already-restored car, not looking to restore
one that he already owns.
	Your argument makes a lot of sense if you are trying to justify a
very messy and rather expensive hobby--especially to your family members. ;^)
However, it doesn't hold much water with prospective car buyers.
	You can't really compare a 25+ year-old car to a new one, even if the
older car has many new parts.  A new car is a brand-new car, and has all that
wonderful depreciation built right in.  It also has absolutely *no* old parts.
Try finding a 914 with a completely-new body sometime.
	In general, you compare a driveable example of a car (I'm not talking
about concours-quality stuff, here!) to other driveable examples.  Even if
one of them has lots of new stuff, they are still pretty close to equivalent.
(At least, if one assumes nothing is falling apart on the "other" car.)  You
are also taking a chance that a car is not what it is represented to be--I
assume we all know of "no rust, never-hit" 914s that are about 90% Bondo,
right?  It doesn't happen all the time, but it is a risk.  There is also no
warranty on most used vehicles.
	These are all reasons that old cars are usually sold for less than
new cars.
	Your point about new parts becoming used the instant you open the
package is also well-taken.

	The unfortunate part about owning these old cars is that it will be
a loooooong time (if ever) before they are worth much more than you paid for
them.  You can buy a pretty-good example for $3K, and rebuild the engine and
transmission for $4K.  Then you have a car that is worth about $5K.
	Hey, if I was looking for an investment, I'd have bought Intel stock.
I wanted a car that was fun to drive, and relatively easy to work on.  The
914 has that in spades.
