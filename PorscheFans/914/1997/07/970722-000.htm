  Disk brakes do make noise, depending on what kind of pads etc., but
they should be quiet when not applied.

 I understand that the pads are supposed to touch (I think) the
rotor, but should it make enough contact to howl? 

  Nope... they are not supposed to touch.  If you check the Haynes
manual, you will see an illustration on page 115 where a guy is
sticking a feeler gauge between the pad and the disk. This is the
"venting clearance" measurement, and the pads are supposed to clear
the disk by .008".

  If you observe fig. 18.6a on page 117, you will see the lever that
sticks out of the inboard cylinder on the rear caliper and the
attachment point for the handbrake cable.  The opposite end of this
lever pivots on a shaft that goes into the inboard  cylinder of the
rear caliper.  On the opposite end of this lever from where the cable
connects is a notched-out area, with a pin sticking out of the
caliper body into the notch. This forms a travel-limiter for the
lever.  With a little careful examination, you can determine which
direction that the lever will be in when the tension is off the hand
brake cable.  The caliper lever should be positioned so that the
relaxed end of the notch is contacting the travel-limiting pin.  If
the pin is in the middle of the notch, you can move the lever so that
it travels further in the direction opposite to the pull of the
cable.  (This is the direction that that big spring on the caliper
lever tries to make it move.)  This should free up the caliper,
provided the venting clearance is properly adjusted.
  If the lever is already fully relaxed, you will have to perform the
venting clearance adjustment.

					Good Luck,
                                                            Jim T.
