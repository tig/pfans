From an objective viewpoint I can't call the rules totally oppressive,
at least not deliberately. Yes, the 914 seems outclassed in almost every
placement. But not all of them have been fully exploited. The 914 is in
B/S now because it has won the lower stock classes so often that it was
considered a bit of an overdog. Maybe, but only at the hands of a
Reitmier, Compton or Short. But once the Miata came out, the 914 was
hard pressed to keep up. The 914 was moved into the new B/S with the
miata because they -knew- that the 914 would clean up in teh
restructured C/S, so teh car is now caught inbetween. Too fast for C/S,
and too slow for B/S.

To date, there are very few examples of a "fully prepared" Srteet
Prepared 914. Mostly because it hasn't been in a position of contention
untill the last few years or so. It wasn't long ago that the 914 2.0 was
in A-Stock and A-Street Prepared. Why? Well, it had the same
displacement as the six I guess. I don't really know why, but I'm glad
it has been moved down. I would like to develop a 100% C/SP 914. But
that is a long term goal. It will never have enough power in SP trim to
out launch its competitors. But maybe with a great driver and suspension
design and big meaty tires, it maight be able to do well on speed
maintenance courses. Forget about Pro Solo2, the RX-7 and M3 will walk
away from the 914, and there's a CRX out there that I hear can pull away
from an M3 on a pro launch. And the M3 was driven by Bob Tunnell, one of
the best drivers in the country. The CRX was protested heavilly, the
engine and transaxle were torn down completely and found to be 100%
LEGAL. Somebody did their work right. Yikes. So, maybe, the 914 can
handle C/SP but I doubt it. D/SP may be a good spot for the car,
especially if the 180hp RX-3 stays in D/SP.

A Prepared? I don't think it maters _what_ you do, the Loti are simply
too good. Light, powerfull and telepathic handling. They just can't be
beat.

The 914 2.0 dominated C/S from it's transfer out of A/S untill the
arival of the Miata, which wasn't so long ago. As for other categories,
the 914 really hasn't been found dominant anywhere. Competetive
sometimes, but never dominant. But we'll see what happens in SP. I would
like to think that another $10k could get my car up to national level.
But the driver right now still has alot to work on.
