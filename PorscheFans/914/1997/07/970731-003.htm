Yes.  As you drop the front, the arm that connects the wheel axle to the
torsion bar raises.  This rotation changes the toe setting,  you can
adjust for some of it. If you modify the plate in the tower you can get
more adjustment and drop it another half inch or so.  I had a welder cut
the rim off the plate cut as much of the plate as possible and then weld
the rim back on.  I would make you a drawing if I knew how.
I would drop it to where I wanted it and then when the alignment guy
can't get the tow right have him raise it until it is right with the
adjustment as far out as possible.  You may also want to put a spacer
between the steering rack and the body to take up a little bump steer,
about 3/8" or see an after market parts catalogue.
Good Luck   Bill S.
