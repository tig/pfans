Teeners,

After Saturdays visit to the Historic/ Vintage Races at Seattle
International Raceway this weekend, all I could think about was the
rarity of Wade Clarks 906 Carrera 6 and saving the dough for a MOMO
wheel. They had their complete display truck, complete with outrageous
prices and limited hub collection. But one wheel, the MOMO Monte Carlo is
a popular leather clad 914 accessory. 
Well, I could not afford or justify the $189 plus hub (another $59) that
seemed one of the lower prices around. My previous 73 914 had a GRANT
Challenger I transfered to the new car (75 1.8) when I got it. I like the
13" for street driving. Since I had the Grant hub, I went and purchased (
at my local Schuck's) a very nice leather wrapped GRANT CORSA GT.
Virtually identical to the MOMO Monte Carlo/ DINO FORZA for $85!!!! I
would highly advise this option to others of limited resources. I only
paid $25 about a year ago at the junkyard for the Challenger and hub. 
There is no "official" GRANT hub--I believe mine is off the Volks. You
have to mount the hub slightly clockwise to get the self cancelling
right, but the wheel lines up fine.

Could someone with a MOMO or DINO measure the horn button hole for me? I
would like to add a button with the Porsche crest instead of the GT that
came stock. I guess I could use a wheel center sticker.

Can't recall who was wondering, but HAMMERITE makes a "Hammered Black"
paint that works wonderfully for targa tops and wiper arms. Good Texture
look, beads water well and just the right blend of shine and dull.
