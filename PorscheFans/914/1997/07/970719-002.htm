 The following is the reply that I posted to the Renegade 914 page in
all the places where the above appears:

 G.P.R. has a great bunch of guys, who are both
courteous and helpful.
  I would never have known about Viton oil seals and
O-rings if Jim at G.P.R. hadn't put me wise.  Dave at G.P.R.
is the original source of the data about the necessary
modifications to the after-market oversize oil pumps for
the 914-4 engines that I have posted on this web page.
  I find G.P.R.'s prices to be some of the best around,
and if I place my orders in a timely fashion, I get next-
day service (although I am < 200 miles away).
  I would not hesitate to recommend G.P.R. to anyone
on the net.

                                                 Regards,
                                                 Jim T.
