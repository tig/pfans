 I dont' know about anyone else, but I'm sure as hell not getting much out
of those articles (infomercials?). If I installed a set of Raceware case
bolts and torqued them to the specified torque spec and the crank froze, I
certainly would want to know *why* the crank froze. Obviously, something's
wrong somewhere. 

These articles just gloss over so many things and then don't mention the
others. The simple use of a straight-edge can reveal so many things about a
pair of mating case halves that I would consider it's use manditory.
Likewise plastigauge. I'd rather read a haynes manual (or a factory manual
if I had one) than these little "infotainment" articles.

It's the same in HotVW's and VW Trends - fluff and very little substance.
