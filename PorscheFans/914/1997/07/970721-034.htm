In a message dated 97-07-21 16:18:49 EDT, you write:

<< bolt-in cage	$500?  used?

Expect $650 or so for a good one, with side braces, PLUS installation.  A
"bolt in" cage still requires the mouning points to be welded in.  If someone
does it for you, count on $350 to install.

 battery cut-off	?

Simple, $40, plus a couple of cables.  Get the one with the alternator
protector.  And don't forget the spillproof battery (Optima), $130

 window net	?  Get from Racer Wholesale, cheap!  If you don't have one of
their catalogs, get it!

 brake pads	$200

Yep. I use Hawks.  Plus, check your lines, and allow money for brake fluid to
flush before every race.  CarboTech makes the rears with the Hawk material.
 If your disks are anywhere near the minimum thickness, buy new ones.

 R1s		$500 - have 205/60R15 but 205/50 still stock? 

 Must run 205/60s or 195/60's to say stock.  Yoko has both, BF Goodrich only
has 205/60's.  Count on getting 3 or so races out of a set.  And R1's have
risen in price if shaved.  Probably $550 plus mounting and balancing, unless
Goodrich is at the track; they'll do new tire mounting for free.

 Springs		$100  

Too low.  Count on Sport Konis with the adjustable coil overs from
Automotion.

 T-bars		$100 

Way too low for 22 or 23 mm's.  You'll never find them used.  Count on at
least $200-250.

 Shocks		$200  Count on $450 for Koni's or Bilsteins.  Forget anything else.

 Harnesses	already have - can long 911 harness be dual-use
 		for both cars?  i.e. some way of attaching to cage?  

Probably work, or buy attachments from Racer Wholesale.

 Extinguisher	have
 OMP race seat	already have

You forgot 15x6.5" wheels, the driver suit, spares (CV joint, wheel bearings,
FI parts, gaskets, etc.).  Oh, you'll also need an external oil cooler for a
2.0-$400 to $450 from BAT.  Also need a GOOD exhaust system, $600 or so.  

Numbers and class stickers-$50.

You also forgot plastic bushings for the suspension, $100, and monoballs for
the upper front strut mounts, $175.  After insalling all of those suspension
pieces, that car needs to be realigned and corner balanced, $200. How about
rain tires and wheels?  Do you have sway bars?  Do you have a trailer to haul
it?  Spare gas cans (you don't want to pay track prices for gas).

Don't forget the license fees, entry fees ($250 per race), your race physical
every two years, hotel and travel expenses.

I'm NOT trying to discourage you, just making sure you are aware.  Nancy and
I WANT more competition in class J!
