914ers,

I'm finally feeling like my 4 year long 914 journey is starting to payoff.
Maybe the turning point was tonight.

After going through two unsuccessful 1.7 liter rebuilds, a recent 2.0 liter
rebuild which went from stock F.I to bumped up compression, competition
valves and brand new Weber 40's and numerous small things like broken fuel
pumps, replaced fuel lines (through the tunnel), bad brake calipers and
frozen torsion bar adjuster bolts, the car is finally starting to come
around.  

My little 4 year list of improvements:

75 2.0 liter engine with lots of mods
factory 'sport' heat exchangers and Bursch extractor
22 mm Weltmeister swaybar (front)
new adjustable Koni's
140 lb. Weltmeister rear springs
fiberglass hood
ultra-thin front windshield (imported from Denmark - 3/16")
new front calipers
new fuel lines everywhere
new Carter fuel pump (up front)
new VDO guages
beautiful 89 VW Chrome Yellow paint (of course it has to be yellow)
and to top it off, a really cool, thick wooden BOAT steering wheel that
took me a while to convert to the hub.

It isn't all that much considering what some of you have done to your cars,
but working on a limited budget and not being home half of the time to work
on it (I'm a Big 6 consultant), it feels good to finally take it out and
put it through some corners, and boy does it like to go through the
corners!  But thanks to many of you, it makes it through the corners...

To finalize this little story, I got to wash it for the first time in 4
years tonight.  What a feeling  :)

Later,
