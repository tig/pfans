	I wonder, is the above concept just too much for some people?
Today was the FIFTH time so far this year that someone has decided to
turn left from the right lane while I was in the left lane.  Happily,
this particular doofus signalled his intent, so I was able to stomp
on my brakes and avoid plowing into him.
	Heck, even if I'd hit him it wouldn't have done anything--he
was driving a big pickup truck (I'm trying not to let this bias me
against pickups!  Really I am!) and I was in my little yellow CRX.  I
would have wound up wearing my engine, while he would have had to un-
bend the steps up to the driver's seat.
	Does anyone know where I can get a bunch of "NO LEFT TURN FROM
RIGHT LANE" signs or bumper stickers made up?  For the bumper stickers,
I want the glue to be on the printed side, and I want glue that bonds
to glass PERMANENTLY.  Just so they'll always have a reminder right in
front of their face....
	That, and the "I sure hope you f*** better than you park"
business-type cards, and maybe people will attempt to pull their heads
out of their nether extremities before they get behind the wheel...

	Sometimes I just wish I could telecommute.
