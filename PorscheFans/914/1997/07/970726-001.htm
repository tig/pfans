"The Brake Saga Continues...

Having eliminated all other possibilities (or so I thought), I
replaced my master cylinder (with one from GPR no less!)

Still don't have any real pedal pressure.  The pedal goes down until
the master cylinder bottoms on the stop.  There are some brakes at
that point.  There are no leaks, I ran ridiculous amounts of fluid
through the system when bleeding it, venting clearance has been
checked about 4 times.

Is anyone else running a 19mm MC, BMW front calipers and no
proportioning valve?  Is there some reason this wouldn't work?"

  I should insert a caveat here... what I learned about brake
bleeding (the sucessful technique, that is) I learned from Josh
Hadler... I did discover a number of things that didn't work all on
my own.  At any rate, Josh is the final authority, and what I tell
you is mostly third hand from him, so if anything doesn't make sense,
I have probably distorted it and you should check with Josh.

  First, fluid quantity... as I said, I used up a lot of brake fluid
discovering what DIDN'T work, but even so, the 914 takes a LOT of
fluid to bleed correctly.   I would imagine that my total consumption
(mistakes included) was of the order of 5 gallons.  That's right you
read it correctly... 5 GALLONS!!

  Second, the things that don't work.   Vacuum bleeders, i.e.
mighty-vac, etc.  These merely invert the seals on the calipers, and
suck air into the caliper past the piston.    Rule one: NO VACUUM!

  Rule two:  No pressure bleeders.  The air collects in the master
cylinder.  Ideally, the master cylinder should be pre-bled on the
bench before installation.   If not, you will be able to get most of
the air out of it, but there is only one way to do it.   That way is
NOT pressure bleeding.   Any attempt to force fluid through the
system from the reservoir causes the fluid to percolate through the
master cylinder without sweeping the air out of it.   I got beautiful
trails of bubbles that finally subsided into clear fluid, and still
no pedal.   So, repeating rule two:  NO PRESSURE BLEEDERS!

  Rule three:   Pump The Pedal !!   This is the method given to me by
Josh, and it is the ONLY thing that  worked at all.   Briefly, the
technique is this:  It takes two people; one to pump the pedal, and
the other to manipulate the bleed screws on the calipers.  Be sure
the brake fluid reservoir is full and kept full, or else you will
have to start all over.  Have the person in the car press down on the
pedal.   Go to the caliper farthest from the master cylinder.  Open
the bleed screw.  Close the bleed screw.   Have the person in the car
lift their foot, and then press down again.  Open the bleed screw
only with pressure in the system.  If possible, try to close it on
the last part of the down stroke of the pedal when fluid is still
moving.   Repeat until all bubbles dissapear.  Use a 1 quart catch
jar.  If you have not moved a quart of fluid through each caliper,
you have not caught all the air yet. Keep going.   Bleed both bleed
screws if your calipers have two.  Notice I said a QUART of fluid per
caliper.  This may be a slight exageration, but ONLY slight.  I would
lay in AT LEAST ONE GALLON of brake fluid before starting to bleed. 
Chances are, you will need more than that.

  Once you start, don't stop!   If you break for dinner, the air will
move backwards into the least accessible part of the system (Murphy's
law) and you will need to run a lot more fluid through to where you
can sweep it out again.

  One last hint:  When you finish up, the brake warning light will be
blinking at you.  There is a push-button switch under a rubber boot
that sticks out sideways from the master cylinder.  It is off-center
on the pressure switch... the widget that has the two wires connected
to it. Press in on this small rubber boot to reset the brake warning
light.

 I have stock brakes all around, but I am guessing that it is the 914
hydraulic system layout that is responsible for your problems, and
not the 320i brakes.

					Good Luck,
                                                            Jim T.
