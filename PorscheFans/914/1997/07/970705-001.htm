I made a bad diagnostic check on my 75 1.8 . None of the regular 
injectors are working. I pulled all the injectors out and turned motor 
over several times (with the fuel pump turned on by the air flow 
meter], no fuel was coming out of the injectors. I read that the 
injectors open every time the contact in the dist. opens and closes but 
how is the brain getting the signal. Is there a way to by pass for 
testing.? Could I run voltage staight to the injectors to open them up, 
and if so how much voltage and which pin for which polarity?
thanks
