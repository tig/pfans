Actually I just got the stock FI back on.  Had dual Weber 44's and the 009
from the PO.  I like FI better, plus have the CA smog to deal with.  The
Jacobs is CARB approved.

Those large plug gaps sounded too big to me at first but works fine on the
Thing.  I guess the variable coil deals with it, bigger spark.  My seat of
the pants test on the Thing showed much smoother start and idle and a bit
more power.

If you're ditching the fuel injection, then you can use the compufire coil
pack ignition for about 200$. You'll need a 009 distributor, also, for
about 45$. The compufire replaces the cap, rotor, coil, wires and points.
It has two coils on a slab with an umbilical to a circular part that mounts
on the distributor. Each coil has two ignition wires coming off of it (2
coils total). This is what I'm putting into my 914 someday.

0.050" plug gap - whoeee!!
