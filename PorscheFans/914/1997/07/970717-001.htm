Ok,  spent some time trying to find out why the buzzer on the fuse panel
buzzes as soon as I put the #11 fuse in.  This is a 73 and I'm using the
Haynes wiring diagram for the 73 USA version.  This is weird.  The buzzer
is in a circuit for the door switches, the seat belt switches, and the
Fasten Seat Belt lite.  After testing things, going in a few circles, and
just as it was getting dark I finally determined that it seems to be fine
if I have the key on.  Then the buzzer works properly, buzzing if door
switch open or if the emergency brake is released and the seat belts aren't
buckled.

However when the key is off it just buzzes, opening a door switch will make
a sound change in the buzzer.  I went back over the wiring diagram and I
need to know a few things if anyone can help.  See the Haynes Fig. 9.78
1973, USA - Part 1 and Fig. 9.79 1973, USA - Part 2.

When the power is off, on the buzzer (item 66, part 2)  87a still has 12v
from the always powered fuse #11.  Term 86 seems to be grounded so it
buzzes.   This terminal goes to term. 86 on the Fasten Seat Belt lite (item
67, part 2) and also to a number 52 which takes it to the part 1 diagram
and the door switches (item 33, part 1)  goes through the door switches and
to the  Su terminal on the Steering Column switch (item 26, part 1).

I'm trying to figure out what is going on.  Will be testing a few more
things tonight, see if I can isolate the problem to the seat belt lite side
or the door switch side.

What is the terminal 'Su' on the Steering Column switch do, is it an input
or an output and it's exact functionality?

Is there any part in the Fasten Seat belt light that could go out to cause
this but still let it function ok with power from the keyed 12v applied to
term 15? Diagram shows a transistor,  couple diodes and 3 resistors?

Also there is a wire from the Fasten Seat Belt lite, term 50a that goes to
the emergency brake switches and the combo gauge (item 21).   The diagram
shows an item 34 as Parking Brake contact and an item 32 as Brake Warning
light switch.  Not sure about these.  Which is the switch that the
emergency brake hits when released and is that switch a normally open or
closed, i.e. does the emergency brake hitting the switch open the circuit
or close it?  What is the other switch shown on the diagram and where is
it.

This is a bit weird to figure out. Since the buzzer always has 12v to it,
I'm assuming that the term 86 on it going to ground or not controls the
buzzer.  So with the key off and term 86 being grounded it buzzes.  I
assume it shouldn't be grounded at this point so either the connection
through the Fasten Seat Belt lite or the door switches to that Su terminal
is the problem.

Appreciate any suggestions.

Thanks,
Jeff
