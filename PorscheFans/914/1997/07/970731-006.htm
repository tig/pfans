Hi Jim,

Yes, I think these two types of ignition upgrades get confused.  The
Pertronix and Compufire point replacement units, usually about $50-$75, are
just for points replacement.  I understand the advantage is no readjustment
due to wear of the rubbing block, no points bounce at higher rpm etc.

The more expensive electronic ignitions may or may not replace the points,
the coil, etc.  I only have direct experience with the Jacobs one but
understand others like the MSD units are also good.  There are Capacitive
Discharge systems, multiple sparking systems, combinations of these, etc.

I bought the one for the Thing as the Jacobs Bugpak directly from Jacobs.
This is their Omnipak unit that combines a variable coil and the ignition
into a big 4" square cube.  Also a set of their plug wires made up for a
type 1 VW with the correct length and air seals.  Paid $220 about 16 months
ago.  I wouldn't buy directly from Jacobs again.  I like the unit but when
you call you get the high pressure sales tactics.  I also had some problems
with the plug wires, seals installed wrong, one had the boot pull off.
They are warranted for life and they replaced ones quickly but a pain to
deal with.

With the Jacobs, probably others, you can reduce the point gap since just a
signal provider now.  I think to about .009 so this reduces the point
bounce. You have to retime after changing the gap.  You also increase the
spark plug gap with these units.  I have the Thing at .050 gap and will
start the 914 at .045 then widen to find best gap.

When interested in one for the 914 I bought one from Performance Products
during their 20% sale.  Paid about $140 for just the Omnipak cube.  I
bought a set of universal MSD 8mm plug wires (V8 set so will get 2 sets of
custom length wires out of it, $44 from Summit Racing catalog).  I'm going
to use the better Corvair type air seals ( I forwarded some emails from Bob
Hoover on the VW lists about them to 914 list awhile back) on these.  I had
called Jacobs about the plug wires initially and they didn't have a set,
they recommended the sets that Performance Products carried.  I got the
idea for the MSD wires from someone on the lists.

Even though the Jacobs has its own built in coil it needs a signal from the
old coil so you have to keep it mounted on the 914.  There is a special
cable included that goes to the center of stock coil then to ground.  Not
sure why the unit needs this, something to do with FI systems.  The Thing
has carbs and the unit with that doesn't need the old coil but I left it
mounted.  The advantage is if ever a problem, just unhook a few things and
regap a few and back to stock.

There is also a Capacitive Discharge unit, point triggered, not
multi-sparking,  that Bob Hoover had recommended on the VW list.  It is
about $100 as I recall.  I think it will work for FI systems also with a
minor modification. Don't know more about this one, just passing on what
I've learned from emails on the VW lists and reading the Hoover Sermons on
the web.

Hope this helps,
Jeff

Hi Jeff!

  That's what I've been waiting to hear!  I hear people talking about
Pertronix and how they have to modify things with a file, and I was
remembering the 60's when typical electronic ignitions used the
points and just prolonged their life with lower current.
  That means to me that the Jacobs Omnipak that you mentioned does
not require a modified distributor.

  Now the only question is:  where does one procure these things, and
how much do they cost?

     Thanks in Advance,
                                                            Jim T.
