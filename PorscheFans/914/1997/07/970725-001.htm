About a year or more ago I saw a very very nice 914-6 at the swapmeet. It was
silver, in concourse condition, had all the original stuff (paperwork, factory
Becker radio, tool kit etc), a fresh motor, and a $21,700 price tag. Needless to
say I'm not interested in a perfect car to cut and modify. But I do recall that
the guy was from the San Diego Region, first name was Rich and the car had won a
series of concours awards.

Well yesterday, I got buzzed by what I believe was that same car. He came from
behind and passed me like a bullet. I managed to catch up, but was doing over a
110 on  El Camino Real with my wife in the passenger seat and asking "Why are
you going so fast?". After a  right turn and about a mile or so of sfternoon
traffic he managed to slalom thru some slower cars and was lost from view. 

At the next light he was not to be seen and therefore I believe that he must
have turned into one of the streets in my neighborhood. I seem to remember that
he lived in the area around Palomar Airport (ie La Costa).

Do you know the guy? Maybe I've got a local that I can crack a Beck's with while
kicking 14-6 tires.
