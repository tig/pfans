John,

For about $275 H&H Specialties in MA has a great tow bar.  3/8" x 2 1/2"
stamped steel (stores in a bag in 10 minutes if you'd like), hardware
and mounting plates for your '14 included.  Uses a Fulton coupler, class
2, 2" ball.  You have to drill through your pan under the spare for the
mounting plates.  My car is slightly lowered, but I don't have to remove
the brackets for driving (street or track, but look out for potholes). 
Attaches to car with clevis pins and clears the front valence.

Maiden voyage over the 4th to the Glen: over 1000 miles at 75 mph and
better, no sweat.

Ask for 
Leigh Houseman
20 Reid Road
Chelmsford, MA 01824

508.256.9465

I'd seen one in use by an old timer and finally got ahold of Leigh. 
Took about a month and a half of convincing (calling every 3 days!) to
get him to order steel and make one up for me.  When I spoke to him a
couple weeks ago he'd made 10 sets.

Good luck!
Tell him that persistent kid with the 914 in Michigan sent you.
