<< What do other people do
 about working on cars in the summer? Do you work at night only? I wound up
 after about 3-4 hours near heat exhaustion, even with drinking plenty of
 water and dosing myself over the head with plenty of cold water. It takes me
 hours to recover from these work sessions. Anyone have an answer? >>

Hi Dirk, I also do a lot of work in the heat, I'm in south east PA and we're
having the same stinking humidity that you guys have.  The heat index
yesterday was 104degrees, and I worked out in the garage from 7:45am
to 4:30pm with a lunch break only.

I have the fortunate position of working in a garage so I'm out of the sun,
but it gets plenty hot in the garage too.  I know it's a bad when the sweat
keeps dripping down on what I'm working on.  

What I have done is to buy one of those commercial type high volume fans
for the garage & outside.  It is still hot but the fan pointed on you will
make 
it somewhat more bearable.  We're not talking a cheap $19.00 fan but believe
me $50 or $60 is worth it.    

Drink a lot of water while you are working, and tie a wet towel around your
neck.  

Take care/keep cool.
