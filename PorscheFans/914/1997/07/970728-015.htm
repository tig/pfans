A bad condensor can cause points to fail. It can also cause a host of
other weird ignition type problems. They're cheap enough to replace, but
a PITA 'cause you'll probably need to retime the motor when you do it.

I would like to know what the prices of other aftermarket ignition
systems is. Someone I know is developing (and selling) a fully
programable ignition w/external input optional for about $400. This
includes box, wires, coil and plugs. I have talked to a few local
autoxers here who have voulanteered their motor as test platforms and
they all agree that mid-range response has improved significantly. No
dyno-numbers yet, in a couple of months though. And no, this was not a
blind swap either. All of the test cars had thoroughly tuned and
refreshed Bosch ignition systems.
