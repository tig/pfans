	If you're paying that much for AVSs, you're either not putting
tires on a stock 914, or you're paying too much.  I bought four AVS-i's
for my 914 (195/50-15) for less than $500.  I previously had 509s on it,
same size.  The price delta was about $150 for all four, if I remember
correctly.  ($85 each vs. $120+ each.)  Talk to Tire Rack (800/428-8355)
and Discount Tire Direct (800/831-3456).  The trick there is to find some-
one locally who will mount and balance the tires for reasonable $$.
	I haven't driven the AVSs in the rain yet, but I will say that
they are noticeably better in the dry than the 509s.  Just barely.  This
is based on memory of how the 509s were when fresh, as I switched from old,
dead, hard, bald 509s to fresh new AVS-i's.
	If the i's had been $100 more per tire (that's double the price!)
I wouldn't have bothered.  I'd say try the 509s, if you don't like them,
you only have to live with them for six months.  Just approach the limits
carefully, like you would with any unknown.
	Hope this helps!
