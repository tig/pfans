This doesn't make sense - most VDO gauges will have 5 connections:
	+/- backlight,  +/- gauge, and signal

If you have two connections (no light in gauge) for power and ground
where is the gauge going to get its signal?

This is how all my VDO gauges look on the backside.  The "S" connection
is
for the signal wire from the sending unit (in your case the CHT sender).

It's a feature.  The CHT sender is a termisitor which is attached to
chassis
ground (by screwing into the head) and its signal wire.  The resistance
can
be measured by attaching a multimeter to the signal wire and any place
on
the car you can find a good ground.  Check it with the car warm.  The
resistance
should go down as the tempurature goes up.
