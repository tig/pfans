<Can someone clue me in on the hows and whys to replacing rear brake
pads.>

Having just replaced rear calipers (new ones, thanks Zims) and pads on
Memorial day, I can say it's very straightforward:

1. Loosen lug nuts, jack up rear, put on jackstands, and remove lug nuts
and wheels.
2. Remove clips on the inboard side of the retaining pins.
3. Remove retaining pins, and spring piece between them.
4. Remove remove old pads.
5. (Ala Haynes) assembly is the reverse of above.

I would take the time to check rotor thickness while you're there, as
it's not a big deal to pull the caliper and replace the rotor, if needed
(although getting a new rotor on short notice could be a toughy).

Also I'd check the venting clearance on either side of the caliper. Make
sure the parking brake is released. You need to pull the two caps; it's
a 13mm plastic cap on the outboard side and either a 4mm allen or 10mm
SS plug on the inboard (for the inboard, you need to go through an
access tube in the trailing arm). If it's the 4mm allen cap and it's
frozen, a couple of medium smacks with a hammer on the allen wrench
helps. Then it's a 4mm allen wrench to adjust either side. The outside
is held in place by a 13mm locknut. The spec is 0.2mm or 0.008"

I replaced my stock pads with Metal masters from Performance products
and they required reaming the upper retaining pin holes as they were for
an OEM alfa romeo application. Obviously stock replacements wouldn't
need this. It goes quickly - took me about 3 hours to replace pads,
calipers and bleed the brakes (a one beer job, as my dad would say).

<I'd buy the beers next time you're in Seattle.>

Sold! although it'll be a while, as I'm in the D.C. area now.
Alternatively you might cut a deal on those shop manuals ;).

BTW if any one is interested in a pair of freshly rebuilt rear calipers,
I have a set available (fronts too for that matter). I rebuilt them with
a GPR kit, but could get the venting clearance right on the right side.
