When I first read Bernie's post I just breezed by it with a quik
read-through and deleted it.  Now that Jim has added to it, it caught my
attention and I thought I'd add a long bit to try and bring clarity. 
Read carefully.

You must remember that before STP came on the scene, we simply had single
grade oils.  The original STP product was, and is what they now refer to
as, a Viscosity Index Improver (VII).

First off, let's take a stray discussion for just a moment.  Remember
that additives (or as we now refer to them - additive packages) do NOT
lubricate, the oil does.  So, that dispells the first old fart's tale
that says "you build an engine using STP to hold journals etc. together
as you assemble".  If you do that, you have NO lubricating going on at
the friction contact points in the first moments of engine starting,
after the build up.  You think you are lubricating but you're not.  The
only reason to use this VII product is to have a substance that is thick
and sticky, to hold the parts that would normally, possibly, fall apart,
making it harder to assemble.  Peanut butter is thick and sticky, would
hold the parts together, and has just as LITTLE a lubricating ability as
the VII substance - but the peanut butter wouldn't assimilate (especially
if it was a chunky variety  :-]  ) into the petroleum oil the same way as
the VII would, so neither would be good in engine assembly.  For engine
assembly, choose a good lubricating product.

OK, back to the opening thoughts about straight weight oil and multi-vis
oil.  Here's a question you must ask, and answer, to have clear
understanding of this subject of engine oil viscosity; "Is a SAE 10W -
30, a 10W, or a 30, all of the time?"  I'll go the long way around to
answer that very point of understanding.  The question can be asked of
any SAE multi-vis oil, 5W - 20, 20W - 50, etc.  The first number on the
left is the cold temperature viscosity reference and the number on the
right is the hot temperature viscosity reference.  The number on the left
may have a "W" attached to it, it may not.  There is a definable
difference between a 10W and a 10, for instance.  There is a product that
is seen with some frequency called a 20W - 20.  What that means is that
the oil has the definable viscosity characteristics of a 20W at cold
temperature (32 F) and the definable viscosity characteristics of a 20 at
hot temperatures (220 F).

The reason I mentioned STP and VII is that that is what the oil companies
caught on to, to manufacture what we now know as multi-vis oils.  The oil
is always (and will always stay as) a base viscosity, with a VII added to
multi-vis oil to make it "appear" like it is a different viscosity at
high temps.  Viscosity is always measured relevant to a temperature.  It
is not just 10W, it is properly 10W at 32 degrees F (which is the
standard used for what's relatively called "cold") or 10W at 220 degrees
F (which is the standard used for what's relatively called "hot").  The
VII is added to give the oil the _appearance_ (there's the key -
"appearance") that it is some other definable viscosity at high
temperatures.

The VII under a microscope looks like a slinky toy.  When heat is
applied, the VII expands, and when it cools it contracts.  What this does
is it hinders the molecules from moving around as rapidly as they would
if the VII wasn't there.  This rapid or slow movement of the molecules is
what gives the liquid the viscosity appearance it has.

So moving back to the posed question in order to form an answer, our
example was 10W - 30, and the the answer is, "the 10W - 30 oil is ALWAYS
a 10W".  That is the base oil.  The VII is added to give it a viscosity
appearance of a 30 at 220 F, but it is always a 10W.  As the additive
package is broken down (and those slinky looking things do shear / break)
through usage, the oil loses it's multi-vis properties, but it is always
a 10W, discernable under lab viscosity testing.

That is a lengthy discussion, but it makes me look at Bernie's line of
questioning more seriously.  If his claim is that the cooler was
originally built with only SAE 30 in mind as an application, and he
switches to a SAE 10W - 30 or 10W - 40, he's effectively gone to a
thinner oil (base of 10W at 32F and the appearance of a 30 or 40 at
220F).  This makes his opening premise of discussion rather confusing. 
He doesn't discuss moving past the use of a straight SAE 30 (which he
says the cooler was designed for) on to straight SAE 40, SAE 50, SAE 60
or SAE 70.  He goes from a discussion of using 5W - 20  on to 10W - 30
and 10W - 40 (which is going from relatively thin, to relatively thicker
- for him).  He makes the statement that, "when it warms up, the oil
thins," and when discussing the multi-vis oils, that is a weak statement,
considering what we've just pointed out about relative appearances.

With the sending unit being pressure sensative (somewhat related to
temperature) you need to know the operating pressures of the specific
oils on a better-understood related basis, i.e. discuss all of them,
relative to operating at 220 F.  Don't hop back and forth between
discussing single and multi-vis without the specific temperature
relationship.

Here is a relevant discussion point:

The operating pressure of _(insert every grade of oil, single or
multi-vis)_ at the operating temperature of 220 F.  If the temp you
measure at stays constant in the discussion, you usually look for
replicating the situation with some repeatable regularity.  For instance,
use you garage as a make-shift dynamometer, measure ambient temps and
barometric pressure, start at cold-start temps every time, develop a
warm-up routine (so much idle, so much revs, etc.) and then measure the
pressure at a chosen temp.

An unscientific random discussion, like the one put forward originally,
only serves to confuse everybody.  For specific viscosity measurements
and applications, all of the major oil companies have technical support
departments which can forward that info on to those who desire it. 
Viscosity measurements are a standard set by SAE and not a sliding scale
from one oil company to the next, so any one should be accurate.  The
application is a choice between the owner's manual and the best
recommendation the oil company gives for the application.

Jim's discussion of a particular brand has relevance in that each company
has a different percentage of additive package to lubricating oil, in its
recipe.  For instance, brand A may have 60% oil & 40% additive package,
brand B may have 80% oil & 20% additive package, and brand C may have 95%
oil with 5% additive package (they do vary that much) in a given 10W - 30
product.  This affects the lubricating ability longevity versus the
longevity of the supporting additive package.  It's a delicate balance,
and it is relative to the goals the oil manufacturer sets for its oil. 
It is NOT relative to viscosity discussion.  A 10W - 30 is a 10W 30 in
the viscosity discussion.  That is measurable and not sliding scale.
