  I think that you will find that if you disconnect  the long straight "helper" spring, and 
operate the throttle, you will still (or should) have throttle return spring action.  The 
torsion spring around the throttle shaft winds up when the throttle is opened (if 
correctly installed) and provides throttle closure action.  My understanding is that 
the straight spring was added as an afterthought to help close the throttle in the 
event of a stiffer than normal throttle cable.

                                        Regards,
                                        Jim T.
