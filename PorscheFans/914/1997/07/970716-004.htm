Hi Son,

The oil drips on the bottom of the oil filter usually come from one of 2
places:  the oil pressure sender on top of the engine (near the
distributor) or else the cooler seals.  So check the oil pressure sender
first!  Remove the boot, and start the car up.  Look for signs of leakage. 
Tighten the sender, but don't overtighten it, or you'll strip the threads
to the case!

The oil cooler seals can be replaced with the engine in the car, but the
job is a PITA.  

1.  jack up car on jackstands (just the rear 2 is fine).  Drain oil, remove
filter
2.  remove the nuts that hold the bracket on the cooler (I think they're
13mm, can't remember)
3.  remove the three 10mm nuts that hold the cooler in place.  Don't lose
the 2 washers behind each nut:  a wavy one and a thick flat one.  You will
need a short 10mm wrench, and perhaps a small 1/4" ratchet and socket to
get these 3 babies.  This is the biggest pain.  Look in your Haynes manual
for a picture of where they live.  They're close to the case.  A small
magnet helps quite a bit.

4.  slide cooler towards front of car as much as possible (3/4" or so)
5.  remove old seals
6.  replace seals.  I used a long skinny screwdriver, and stuck the seal in
place with some grease.  You put the seal on the end of the screwdriver
like a lollipop, and feed the thing up there.  Do the top one first.
7.  slide cooler back in place, and replace the 10mm nuts and washers. 
This is a big PITA that took me 10 minutes each.
8.  replace end bracket nuts, replace oil filter, add oil.
9.  start engine, check for leaks (again!)

good luck.  I spent about 0.8-1.0 hours on this job, your mileage may vary.

cheers, Brian
