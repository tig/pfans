	Well, there's good news and bad news.
	The good news is that the state Referee didn't give me any
flack about not having an engine serial number.  The bad news is
that the car is running *WAY* too rich, especially at 2500 RPM.  I
guess that fixing up the wires actually hurt things...
	The emissions still aren't below GP limits (CO in particular)
so the issue of the earlier testing error never even got raised.
Bleah.
	I do get a free retest, though.  If I can make it pass, I'll
only have to pay the $8 for the certificate.  Saves me the $30 test
fee...

	Anyway, I'm gonna keep plugging away at this.  Right now, I
can't get the car to hunt at idle *at all*.  I turned the fuel pres-
sure down to 20 PSI (from 28!) and it's still too rich.  The head
temp sensor measures good (~50 ohms hot), or even over-lean!  Things
to try next are:  Unplug cold start valve--I may have inadvertently
messed up the wiring to the thermo-time switch when I went "fixing"
things.  Substitute the original manfold pressure sensor back in.  Sub-
stitute an unknown-condition ECU (or two or three, I now have spares).
Check the resistance of the head temp sensor *at the brain* connection
to see if the signal is getting all the way through.
	Of the three possibilities, I am deathly afraid that it's the
last one.  If the wire inside the harness is broken somewhere, then
I'm gonna have to figure out how to replace one wire...   Yeccch!
	Anyway, if none of that gives me results, then it's going to
the mechanic.  Hopefully he can find something simple and stupid that
I missed.  Then again, it's been a while since I made a mortgage pay-
ment for him--or maybe he has another kid to put through college...
	We'll see.  Wish me luck!
