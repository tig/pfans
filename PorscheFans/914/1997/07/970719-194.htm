Venting clearance was set, in fact the outboard pads were a little =
tight.  The fronts started out with some space, but moved up to the =
rotor and the pedal didn't change.  Looks like a new MC is in order.

My question is:  What is brake venting?  Is this the gap between the 
brake pad and rotor when the brake pedal is not pressed? 

Below is my theory of how this gap occurs:
I thought this space or gap was a funtion of the square rubber ring seal 
located in the groove inside the caliper bore. When the brake pedal is 
pressed, and the piston is pushed out to exert pressure onto the pad, I 
was under the impression that this seal was somehow twisted or strained 
slightly. As the brake pedal is released this rubber seal will return to 
its non strained state and pulls the piston back which results in the 
gap between pad and rotor.
This is only my theory on what is going on inside the caliper.  Can 
anyone clear this up for me? TIA
