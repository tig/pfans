  There are two ways that what you wrote can be interpreted, and upon re-reading 
the above paragraph, I'm not sure which interpretation to apply.
  First, a bit of theory.  The sensor is a bi-metallic junction; that is, it generates a 
voltage (with very small current capability) that is proportional to temperature.  This 
voltage, when applied across the constant resistance of the meter movement 
produces a current that is proportional to the temperature of the bi-metalic junction.  
This current causes the meter pointer to deflect, again in a manner that is 
proportional to the temperature of the sensor.
  Now, the voltages and currents involved are quite small, and for this reason, the 
VDO instruction sheet specifically warns that NEITHER wire from the sensor should 
contact any other wire in the car's electrical system, NOR chassis ground.
   Unfortunately, VDO chose to label the negative terminal of their meter as "ground" 
(with, if memory serves, a ground symbol) rather than as minus ( - ) which it actually 
is.  Therefore, you can see my difficulty in interpreting your description.... if you have 
indeed looped the sensor between the meter ( + ) and minus ( - ) terminals, 
WITHOUT any connection to vehicle ground, then it sounds as though you could 
indeed have a bad meter movement.  If you have chosen to connect the leads to 
the vehicle chassis at any point, then you may very well get some very wierd 
readings, owing to minute voltages set up in the vehicle's chassis through the 
normal circulating currents found there.

  If you have any exterraneous connections to the vehicle ground, or if you did not 
run the paired wires from the sensor to the gauge and instead used the vehicle 
chassis for your return, then that is most likely your problem.  If you do not have any 
connections to any part of the vehicle, and have a two-wire loop between the 
sensor and the gauge, then disconnect both wires from the gauge temporarily.  If 
the gauge does not return to zero with both wires lifted, then the gauge is indeed 
bad., and you will have to get a new one.

                                        Good Luck,
                                        Jim T.
