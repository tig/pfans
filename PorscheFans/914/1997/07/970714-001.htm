>I got my ride up and running (poorly).  It runs sorta.  It stumbles, stalls

Don't start looking for problems until you've done all the tune-up
basics.  You'd just be running in circles otherwise.

Adjust the valves. Inspect/adjust the points.  Check/set your timing.
Inspect/replace spark plugs and wires.  Replace your fuel filter.
Remove and flush all the jets in your carbs.  Balance the carbs.  Make
sure there are no intake manifold leaks.

When everything is setup, then you can start diagnosing things such as
head troubles or carb setup problems.  I have a lot of hands-on
experience with dual Webers so let me know if you need help with them.
