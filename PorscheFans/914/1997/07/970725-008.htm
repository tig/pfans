What is the deal Matt Wiesendunk?  Is this a complaint on a major purchase;
engine-trans-car, or a dispute over a $20 part?  Matt has certainly bogged
down the system, making it hard on everyone else.  Matt, please explain how
much money was involved here!  It must be thousands for as much trouble you
have caused!  I have dealt with GPR for several years and several thousand
dollars.  I have recommended GPR to many others, without any problems.  I've
found GPR to be fair and reasonable, so Matt please explain further!!!  If
you have the balls to clog up this forum for a week, you certainly must have
the balls to lay the facts on the table for everyone else to decide!!  We of
the 914 digest readership await your reply Matt!
