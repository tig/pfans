For Mike Lee and other interested parties:

  Mike asks:

> 1) Is there an easy way to externally identify the type of chain tensioners

  A 911 expert I ain't, but I do have a suggestion that MIGHT be helpful.  The latest 
Automotion catalog has a writeup on the various chain tensioners, with pictures.   
They appear on pages 168 and 169.  Perhaps you can deduce what you have 
from this.

  The stud is, as I recall, a flat-headed thing like a rivet, that goes through the tang 
that you speak of and is welded on the back side.  I would assume that rust got to 
the weld, and it has given way.  I am not sure what to do about this.   The only things 
I can think of would be either to use a nut-cracker on the nut (if you can fit it in there) 
or do some sort of violence to the door so that you can get at the back of the tang.   
Hopefully there will be someone out there with a better suggestion than mine.

                                        Good Luck,
                                        Jim T.
