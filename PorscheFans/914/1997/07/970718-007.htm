Thanks for the post, always good to have data points.

One thing to remember though is that he seems to be talking about
water-cooled car.  Since ours are air-cooled, the oil has a larger part of
the cooling job.  In a Bob Hoover sermon from the VW list, he measured the
oil fog in the valve covers and it typically was 100F deg over the oil temp
in the sump.   You can also get a large variation in oil temp readings
based on where the oil temp sender is mounted. Some spots are better than
others.  For our Type 4 engines, the stock mounting place for the center
console gauge, in the small round plate near the oil screen plate is
suppose to be a good choice.  In a tee fitting off the oil pressure sender,
like is sometimes done on the Type 1 engines, is a bad choice.

I was doing some research on recommended oil temp's in race applications
and
got the following advice from a technical contact at Valvoline.  I
though
the list might find it useful, so...
