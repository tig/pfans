When I changed my rotors over, I had to have the rear {911 vented} rotors
turned down slightly, from 11.5" to 11" diameter, to clear the calipers.
I'm not sure which year rotors I have, but know that some are larger than
others. And since they were vented, I had to do a lot of talking to get
the machine shop to beat their lathe up with them [intermittent cuts
break tools, which means that the brake lathe had to be tended for the
entirety of the job]. Cost $60.

The kit I bought didn't have screws, pins or clips ;-{
The 7x65mm screws that are required are special,
and no longer a stocked size at any of the metric parts houses. I had
German Precision [more plugs here] convert the calipers to use 8mm bolts, which
are much easier to find. I only converted the inboard screws, and used
the old 7x50mm ones on the outboard positions.

Lastly, the pad retaining spring clips from 911SC front calipers fit nicely.
You have to drill out the caliper holes for the SC pins, but the length
is correct, and I've had no problems with them working out.
