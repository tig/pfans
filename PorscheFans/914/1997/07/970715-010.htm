Larry:

I totally agree with you, thats why I get the best of both worlds by using
"Redline" MTL in all MGAs and MGBs. It is synthetic, is GL-4 rated, has
nothing harmful to yellow metals, is a super gear lubricant, and wont cause
O/D problems. It is made especially for manual transmission use. In MGTD
and TF I use MT-90, which is one grade heavier. It is really great stuff.
