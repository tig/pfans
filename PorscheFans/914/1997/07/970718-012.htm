Just for curiosity, I called the local Bubba's Bug world, and got the
price of $39.99 new for the switch.  So for what it is worth, BTW, I
asked for a 73 Karmann Ghia head light switch, which I know is identical,
should be the same as a bug, but at least this way it was in the same
factory.

Take care,
