Hey, 'teeners,

   The following contains some material that some people may find
incendiary.  If you are one of them, please, PLEASE, throw the flames at me
(plyman@nwu.edu) and not to the list.  I am sharing this *solely* with the
914 group because I feel this is the only list likely to receive the
message in an exclusively positive way.

  A number of months ago, I was reminiscing with someone about
Porschephiles. As a result, I missed ol' Stan and decided to look him up.
A little searching and a little guessing and I got his e-mail address.

  I asked him how he was doing, and told him that we (or at least *I*)
missed him and were grateful for the legacy he left behind.  He updated me
on his personal situation (which was still dragging along badly after 1.5
years!).  He also asked me to relay his "hellos" to the group:


>I just re-joined PCA, and am starting to feel like I can see 911s without
>starting to cry... 8{) As friends keep telling me, this too shall pass.
>
>If you get a chance, say "hi" to everyone for me. It's not that I don't
>miss everyone, or even think about the guys frequently, it's just that
>it's all too painful to go back into just yet.

  I have waited until I thought this simple gesture wouldn't cause a flame
war.  Please don't prove me wrong!

Later,
Paul Lyman  plyman@nwu.edu
'82 911SC Targa
