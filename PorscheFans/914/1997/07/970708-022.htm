(1)
When balancing an engine during a rebuild, it's best to have the rods
balanced
separately (balanced and weight-matched).  Also it's best to have the
entire
rotating mass of the engine (impeller, crank, and flywheel) balanced as
a unit.
It's too late to do that in your friend's case as the engine has been
reassembled. 

(2)
It is a significant contributing to the longevity of the engine, if the
rest of
the rebuild was done properly.  It'll also help the engine tolerate high
RPM (past
spec. redline) for short periods.

(3)
You can get an end-play measurement tool from many of the aftermarket
suppliers or
use a dial-indicator if you have one.  To set the endplay correctly you
need to 
install the flywheel properly using new bolts, seals and the like - then
measure your
endplay to determine the size of shims you'll need.  Can't remember the
number, I 
think you always want to have three shims of equal thickness.  Then
order them
and R&I the flywheel with the new shims.  Check endplay again.

Hope that helps,
