>Dirk, I noticed in your note to the 2002 digest that you have a 914 P 
>car. Do you know anyone who would like an airconditioning system for one 
>of them?
>In my 27 yrs of messing with Beemers I have inevitably come up against 
>some other 'deals' and this is one of them. I have to admit I know 
>NOTHING about it except that I was told it came off a 914 and was/is 
>complete. That was several yrs ago since when it has been sitting in my 
>garage. I figured that the height of summer/simmer might be a good time 
>to find it a good home. 
>If anyone is seriously interested I will try to do an inventory on it. 
>There was some kind of dash box as I remember it.
>Whats something like that worth?.It is obviously an aftermarket affair.
>Give me your opinion would you
>Bill Proud in nice cool Seattle,where the air is ALWAYS 
>'conditioned'..and washed and running down the gutters!!
>Feel free to put this onto any P-car site etc that you know of.
