Hi all,
I have two completely unrelated questions for you.
1) I recently went through my fuel injection looking for faulty 
components, using the procedure by Kjell Nelin and relying heavily on Ben 
Watson's book, "How to Tune and ModifyBosch Fuel Injection".  Testing the 
components with a multimeter is staight-forward.  When I checked the 
"cold" (70 F in Berkeley) resistance of Temperature Sensor II (the head 
sensor) it measure 8000 ohm but it dropped below 1000 (perhaps 500) when 
warmed up.  The book says that this sensor fails it will be an open 
circuit or ground out.  Is my sensor ok?

2) A while ago, someone asked about the proper ride height in the rear of 
the 914.  I did not see any response to that inquiry, though a through 
discussion of replacement springs and shocks.  How high should the rear 
be?  How do you test the rear springs?  If they are original equipment 
and have 130k miles, are they dead?

I know I only post occasionally, but that seems to a side-effect of being 
on digest-mode.  Incidentally, someone just mentioned the plastic fuel 
lines again -- I believe my lines are OE steel (a '75 or '76 change?).

Thanks for all the help,

Clark Brown
