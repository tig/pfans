	The aux air valve doesn't affect the mixture in any significant
way.  All it does is let more air past the throttle when the engine is
cold.  That's it.  The mixture is still being controlled by the manifold
pressure sensor, which senses the extra air as a "lesser vaccuum" (or as
higher manifold pressure).  The ECU commands more fuel for that extra
air.
	At a guess, check your head temp sensor.  Do you have a resistor
in-line with it?  If so, try removing it or substituting a smaller-value
resistor (or better yet, a potentiometer!) for it.
	Check your fuel pressure.  Check the intake air temp sensor (it
lives on top of the manifold, left and forward of the throttle body).  It
doesn't have a whole lot of effect on the mixture, but there is some...
Is it disconnected?
	Check the vacc hoses, in particular the one from the manifold to
the MPS.
	Timing, dwell, good spark (probably should be first on the list
of things to check)...

	George, of course, will have replacement MPS plugs.  However, they
look like some of the plugs that I can find in a couple of electronic
supply houses locally.  Don't know if they are exactly the same (depends
on if the local ones are metric or not, and probably other stuff too) but
it could be worth checking out.
