	I know two people who have built up 2.4L four-bangers.  One of them
commented that he was going back to a 2.0 because he could get more power
out of it.
	The other guy built one up "just for fun" (I think he retained the
D-jet FI, too--but don't quote me on that!) and drove it for a number of
months before he spun the fan off the crank.  Took out quite a bit of the
rest of the motor that way...

	"Doing it right" probably involves a bit more than just bolting on a
set of Ps&Cs.  In particular, if you want durability, it will probably wind
up costing you not that much less than a Six...  (Particularly with the 3.0
SC motor being as reliable as it is.)
	It appears as if you need a long-life engine, though.  It might be
great for what you need...
	I'm sorry I don't have any real data for ya, Mike!
