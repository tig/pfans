Dan,

Besides the Mahles, don't early Pedrinis fit too?  I had a '73 with the
later hubs and had to machine out the centers of some early Pedrinis to
fit up front without rubbing or binding. I think both early and late
Pedrinis will fit in back for the later hubs, but dunno about the
earlier rear hubs.  Pedrinis are stock offset, and I believe they're
cast, not forged.  I've heard autox guys like them because they're
light.

FWIW, and please clarify if I've got it wrong.
Thwen.
