Hey everyone,

An update on the daily drive 914/914-4 to 914-6 conversion car. The
suspension update project for the summer is done. '85  carrera struts up
front 150lb springs in the back with koni sport yellows and vented discs
all around. Now the problem after all this went together over the last 4
weeks (I have been riding my bike to work and every where else and it
hotter than hell in DC right now) I got the car back from the mechanic. I=

wimped out on doing the springs with visions of the springs decapitating
me. The car came back and the rear of the car was about an inch higher th=
an
before. The tire used to actually be covered by the fender, but now it is=

all the way out. How do I adjust the spring perches at the back of the ca=
r
to correct the ride hieght?? =


Next I have all the stuff that came off the car 73 911 calipers struts
shocks springs discs stubb axles pedrinis . . . If any one wants this stu=
ff
let me know or its going in the trash.


Nick =
