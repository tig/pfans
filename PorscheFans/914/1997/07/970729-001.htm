> Which Breakerless System for the 914?

I have upgraded my car twice. The first time with a Pertronix system,
and aside from the interference fit inside the distributor(which can be
aleviated with a file) it gave me no problems. Not being able to accept
that something so small and simple could work better than a more
complicated system, I ordered the "high"grade crane system that included
dwell extension at high rpm (model 3000) from J.C. whitney (they don't
use the name, but check the picture) and saved a little money. It was
more complicated to install, and I got to replace the Bosch coil to
eliminate the internal ballast resistor, but that system also worked.
With the Crane I did detect smoother running just off idle, but it was
close.

Unless someone reports reliability problems, I'd go with the Pertronix
for that clean concour look for "normal" use(and upgrade the coil
anyway), and the Crane if the engine was modified and needed max. help
in the spark department.
