Greetings, Mike, Josh, and P-fans!

Mike writes  (and Josh echos similar sentiments):

> PLEASE check your tunnel for about 4 gallons of fluid!  
> Or were you just pumping that much through the bleeders at each
wheel? 

 Right.  I would run about 500 ml, and then, just when I thought I
was ready to move on, here would come some more air bubbles.... so
I'd run another 500 ml to make sure...  pretty soon, we're talking
one litre per wheel flushed into the recycle can, and since there are
four wheels, and there are roughly four litres in a gallon, we're
talking one gallon of fluid.  Of course, if the hose falls off, or
anything unusual happens, I start all over again... so the 1 gallon
seems minimal for a typical operation on my 914.  Because of the
quantities of fluid involved, I am running Castrol LMA which is a bit
more reasonable in cost.  

  I have not found it practical to get the air out pushing any less
fluid, and in fact, my pedal STILL feels spongey to me, although the
car stops.  I am looking forward to a 914 get-together that is within
my reliable cruising range so that I can get Josh or Dave D. or Mike
or somebody to drive my 914 and tell me if it feels normal or not.

  Josh told me about pre-bleeding the master cylinder, but I asked
him too late; it was already on the car.  I suppose if I get
desperate enough, I can remove the thing, through it in a bucket of
fluid overnight and then re-install it and start all over again, but
I would hope that that would not be necessary.

  I will say that of all the cars I have worked on, which is quite a
few, the 914 is the most difficult to get the air out of, with the
degree of extra difficulty being easily an order of magnitude.

  Thanks guys for your additional input and help.
