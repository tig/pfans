Thanks Dave. I haven't actually seen the car, even though I bought it.
My brother-in-law, another porsche nut, completed the check out and the
deal. The car has glass flares and 916 bumpers; a really sanitary
install. I'll bet your car looks terrific with those wheels on it. I can
put 7" and 8" by 16" on mine to see how it looks. I have those on an SC.
That should give me an idea of how much wider I can go, but you have
given me to outer limits of what might fit, which is what I was looking
for. What size tires do you have on those wheels?

This all depends on how the flares are put on.  My steel GT-flares fit
16x10 wheels on all four corners!

Most folks think that 7" front and 8" rear (usually 15 or 16" diameter)
is pretty easy with GT flares.
