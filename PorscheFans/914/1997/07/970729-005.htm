	Good news and Bad news

Bad news 70-72 uses a "Hub centering" rim, and from what I know the only =
ones that came that way were the Male rims. (Solid center with small =
ribs coming out (Bunch) to outer.)

Good news I have a set, I think, I got them and found that they were not =
for my 73 so I hung them in the shop. I will check if still there.

Subject:	Looking for Fuchs alloys. HELP!

I want to put some nice alloys on my just finished restoration of my
1970 914.  I would like some input of somebody with Fuchs for sale.
Also is there any other way I can put some nice alloys on with this 4
bolt pattern?   I would like to put some Porsche 5 spokes POLISHED on my
car. Is it possible?
Help from the land of the Green Bay Packers!! World Champions!!!!!
