OK guys, there was a number of years since I had mine, but this is what
I remember:

Crank shaft, can be changed for a balanced (with counterwheights). The
standard shaft is not really OK over 5000 rev's. There is a oil pump
available with better flow and slightly higher pressure. Cylinders, try
get european pistons and cylinders, so you will get 9.5 compression
ratio. A high lift cam around 300 degrees is max, if you want to have
any low power left.  

Heads are tricky, as larger valves mean that you have to shift material,
and alu welding is tricky, at best. Intake and exhaust ports can be
polished, and one of the differences between 2.0 bus heads and 914 2.0
heads are the slightly larger diameter on the exhaust port and heat
exchanger tubes. Valve springs must be in top notch condition and get
those ball jointed adjusters too. Match intake ports with intake
runners. 

Consider carburetion instead of injection for modified engines.
I used Weber 44 IDA's and got good results.    

Ignition is pretty good, but if carburators are used, change distributor
to a Bosch 009.
