I starting rebuilding my wiring harnesses yesterday, and pretty much =
every connector boot was gone, shredded, or just looking kind of sad.  I =
had ordered the FI boot kit from AA, but that only gets you the 4 =
injector boots, the MPS boot, and the TPS boot.  A brief comparison of =
connectors made it obvious that the injector boots could also work on =
the air temp sensor, the cold-start injector, and the thermo switch for =
the warmup air bypass (or whatever it's called...).  The MPS boot is the =
same size as that for the FI triggers in the distributor.  I don't know =
why AA doesn't sell a bigger kit, but everything they did send was =
either a Volvo part (injector boots), or a Mercedes part (TPS and MPS =
boots), complete with part numbers.  A call to the local Volvo and MB =
dealers turned up listings for those parts (at about $10 each).  So it =
is possible to replace every boot on the harness.  Except for the =
connector to the rev limiter (it's a '76 CA model), anybody found =
anything that will fit that?

Not to use up too much more bandwidth, but I need to replace the spade =
connectors going to the MPS (1/8"?) and the rev limiter (1/4"?), with =
some that have the prongs in the back to keep them locked into the =
connector shell.  Local Bug shops and Radio Shack don't carry them.  Any =
suggestions?

Thanks
Andy Lester
