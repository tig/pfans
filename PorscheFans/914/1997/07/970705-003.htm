Mike, 

	Don't risk destroying your injectors that way. I've heard far too many
stories of injectors getting burned out that way. Better thing to do is
test if there is any voltage getting to the injectors. I highly doubt
that you're getting voltage, or at least one of them would be working. I
doubt all four of them could get that baddly stopped up with debris so
quickly. If you have a multimeter, preferably an analog one, hook it up
to the plug that goes into the injector body, have someone turn the
engine, if the needle deflects, you've got juice. I doubt that you do
however, so check the connectors to the FI points. I had this happen
once, it was the center wire on the FI points. That is the ground wire,
and if it breaks, the cold start injector is the only injector that
works.
