Why is the list setup so that a reply sends to the subscribe address 
instead of 914@PorscheFans.com ?!?

I think that if you are patient, you can find good, cheap 914's. I paid 
$3000CDN for my 74 2.0, and it is in pretty fair condition. You can pay 
more and get one that doesn't need a thing, or you can pay less and get 
one that needs some work. I was able to talk mine down quite a bit 
because it has dual dellorto carbs (not FI). Once I tuned them up, I 
doubt that I would go back to FI, but I might piece the parts together so 
that I have everything required if I decide to. Mine also needs front and 
rear bumper strips, and some other small, but expensive (and hard to find 
used) pieces, but for the most part it is a good solid car. There are 
quite a few people that think "Porsche" means that a rusted out '71 1.7L 
is worth $5000, but it is very easy to walk away chuckling when you meet 
these people.
