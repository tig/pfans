Sort of 914 related since I'll be using it on the 914.  I'm looking at
getting a small MIG welder. Been considering a Lincoln 100 with the
addition of the gas regulator, etc. from Home Depot. Heard from several
people that these are good units.

I just noticed Price-Costco has the Century 130 MIG unit for $399.   I seem
to recall an email on a list from someone with one of these.  Looking at
it, it is basically the equal of the Lincoln and that price is the same the
Lincoln would cost me.  The Century has fully adjustable heat and wire feed
controls though which is suppose to be preferable.

Does anyone have any experience with this Century unit?
How easy is it to find parts, tips etc for it?  The Lincoln has the
advantage of getting the parts at Home Depot locally.
Any good or bad experiences with either?

I need to decide soon.

Thanks,
Jeff
