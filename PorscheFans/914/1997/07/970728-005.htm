Well, I finally broke down and had my 914 towed to a mechanic.  Those
troublesome wires that I spent 3 months re-doing were fixed in a matter
of minutes with a soldering iron.  If only my garage had power...  He
also found that my engine is plagued by vacuum leaks.  The boots (which
on my car are hoses) connecting the intake runners to the plenum, are
leaking.  Also there are leaks either between the intake runners and the
plastic blocks, or between the plastic blocks and the heads.  The new
boots should be in within the next few hours, and he's going to try a
little high-temp silicon on the plastic blocks.  I could use a little
clarification on this part... evidently there is a vacuum advance and a
vacuum retard on the distributor.  He disconnected one of them,
re-adjusted the timing, and left it disconnected.  I seem to recall
someone talking about this in the past.. why is this done?  O.K., now
here's my big concern:  I had assumed that the faulty wiring to the MPS
was causing a rich-running condition, and that was producing the smoke
at the exhaust.  Well, it looks like the smoke is oil smoke!  Remember,
this engine's top end has 0 miles on it, and has probably been running
for about 30 minutes total since I put everything back together.  My
mechanic asked if I used synthetic oil (which I didn't - just regular
Valvoline 10W30), but said he'd have to investigate some other things
before he could say what was causing the smoke.  This has me very
concerned.  Here's what I've come up with so far as possible causes,
ranking from "Hey, No Prob" to "Oh Crap...":

1.  The motor has 0 miles on it, and just needs to be broken in.
2.  During the first 20 minutes of running the engine, the mixture was
set very rich, and diluted the oil.
3.  MSHP didn't do a very good job with the valve guides, and they're
leaking like crazy.
4.  The second honing of the cylinders took off too much material, and
now the pistons and rings are just too small.

What else could it be?  I'm so close to having a driveable car... any
help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks again,
