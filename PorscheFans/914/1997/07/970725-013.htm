Greetings, 914-er's!

  I have never used a timesert; I have heard from some on the list
that they are superior to and tougher than helicoils.  If you can get
them in there, I suppose that would be the way to go... however, I
have never had a helicoil fail, and helicoils are unquestionably
stronger than the original threads into the aluminum, which was good
enough for the Porsche engineering department in the first place.

 > Can you do just one or should they all be done? 

  You should do as many as are bad, for sure.  Whether or not you do
any more depends on how you go about it.  If you are trying to do it
with the engine in place on the car, then do as many as you can
reach.  If there are some good original threads that you can't reach,
then don't worry about them.  If you have to pull the engine and send
the head off to a machine shop to get the necessary work done, then
you should do them all... it's cheap insurance at that point.

 > Is there a "best" brand?

  "Helicoil" is, I believe, a brand name, and since they have been at
it for a lot of years, they presumably know what they're talking
about. 

> What are the major concerns?  Do you use locktite? 

  Locktite is a glue that is required by certain engine manufacturers
 in certain locations as specified by the shop manual.... otherwise,
don't use it.  Especially don't use it on the end of the stud that
threads into the helicoil... it is possible that you will turn the
helicoil out of the aluminum the next time you loosen the nut. I
always oil any threads that go into aluminum, but that's just me.  I
have always had good luck doing this, but some people will tell you
that this makes for erroneous torque readings.   I find it impossible
to get accurate torque readings with the fastener "popping", and so I
just dump on the oil.  So far, so good.

  Above all, remember that most requirements for helicoils are
generated by over-torqueing the fasteners... if you use an ACCURATE
torque wrench, and stick to the low end of the specified torque range
when dealing with aluminum threads, you will do fine... these threads
are intended to last the life of the car.   A case of a fastener
actually rattling loose when properly torqued with the appropriate
washer(s) in use is extremely rare.

  I don't remember for sure, because I erased your oldest message on
this subject, but didn't you say you were torqueing the rocker arm
shaft nuts to 15 ft*lbs?  Or am I way off base?  In any event, the
specification for these is 1.4 MKgs, or 10 ft*lbs.  If anyone is
torqueing these fasteners to a 50% overtorque condition, the result
will be looser fasteners due to thread damage, not tighter.  I
reiterate, they won't shake loose at 10 ft*lbs.  They probably won't
shake loose at 6 or 7 ft*lbs.  When in aluminum, a light touch is
good.

  I  hope that you can reach into where you need to go to make your
fix... but you will need an angle drill, a short length twist drill
of the appropriate size to fit it, the appropriate tap for the
helicoil, and the insert tool.  If you can't get all that stuff in
there, then you will just have to drop the engine.

  One other thing... ESPECIALLY if you are useing a click-type torque
wrench... take it to your local tool emporium and get it CALIBRATED! 
In the aerospace industry, a torque wrench cal is good for 90 days. 
If you don't make a living with it, it should be good for a year, and
you can check it against a beam-type wrench in good condition to
extend that... but if it's never been done, now's the time.
