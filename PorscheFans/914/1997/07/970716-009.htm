I finally got the 320i calipers and the rebuilt rear calipers, new =
rotors, new stainless braided lines, etc. on the car.  For anyone having =
as much difficulty as I did in finding hard lines with the correct ISO =
flares (stock lines didn't fit the 320i calipers and took a LOT of =
bending to fit - didn't trust them), J.C. Whitney sells the same flaring =
tool that Eastwood sells, for about $45 with the normal 10% JCW =
discount.  Worked great.

Unfortunately, I can't get any pressure in the system.  The 19mm master =
cylinder was only a couple of years old when I took everything apart, =
and was working fine then.  The system sat empty for 6-8 months (dried =
out seals?).  There was enough pressure to bleed the system, and move =
the front pads up against the rotor, but the pedal still goes to the =
floor.  I've run about a 1/2 gallon of fluid through, and there was no =
more air coming out.  The proportioning valve is gone, so it can't be =
causing a problem, and there are no leaks anywhere.  I was even careful =
not to push the pedal too far in to make sure the piston seals in the =
master cylinder didn't get into any unfinished areas of the bore.  Any =
suggestions other than a new master cylinder?

TIA
