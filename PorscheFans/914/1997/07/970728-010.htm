Same here in Ohio, Dirk.  I try to do most of my work in the AM or PM, but
the heat gets to you on those projects that started as 1-2 hour jobs and
end up as 4-5 hour jobs stretching into the middle of the day.  The only
thing that keeps me going is thinking about NO DRIVING my baby on February
10th!  :)
