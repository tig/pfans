I'm fighting the electrical gremlins in my 73 2.0L+ using the wiring
diagrams in Haynes.  I blew them up to 11x17 on the copier at work and that
helps a lot.  What would really help though would be more details on the
switches.  In some cases it is obvious but others it isn't as clear.  When
the wire connects to the block for the switch on the wiring diagram is it
an input to the switch or an output from the switch for example. And how
the switches function.

Does anyone have some detailed descriptions on these switches?  Something
like for Haynes "on [26] (the steering column switch)  terminal 30 is the
............,  it puts out 12v when the key is on and  turn signal is moved
to activate the right turn signals."

That was a totally made up example.  I'd take any info I can get.  If none
out there I'll eventually compile my own as I go through this and post it
myself but don't want to if already available.  I'll take any info on the
switches I can get.  Headlight switch, emergency flasher, steering column
switch. fog light switch,  heater controls.

Another project I'm considering if none out there cheap, is to do my own
color diagrams.  I've scanned in the 2 diagrams and the relay board layout
for the 73 USA  and when have time will color the lines with paint program
and print on work color printer.  No promises on the time frame but will
post a message when I have them done. Probably be months with current
schedule.
