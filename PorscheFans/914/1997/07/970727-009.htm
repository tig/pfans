I did the same when I bought my house - towed the 914 from the old place 
using a U-Haul dolly about 15 miles.  I didn't seem to have a problem either, 
but it wasn't for a very long distance.  What's the difference between
driving 
a car 100 miles or dollying it 100 miles except that the engine isn't getting 
any where and tear on it?

I'm very interested in this question because I'd like to take my car to a
couple 
of cross-state autocross events, but don't want to run the possible hazards
of driving an AP 914 for 300+ miles.  Plus, I don't have access to a tow
vehicle strong 
enough to pull a trailer and car.  I could get by with just a dolly+car
though.

Any other thoughts out there?

Dion
