cover-up rust with any kind of overlay is a waste of time and money. Even
treated metal will rust when exposed to rust. Clamshell pieces will only
give you the illusion that the frame member has been fixed when in 6 months
the new piece will have allready started it's own rust process. The price
differance is minimal when considering the out-turn.>>

I am responding to the posting above to help clairify what the "clamshell" or
longitudinal brace will do for a 914.  I am referring to the brace that Brad
Mayeur provides and I can't speak for the AA piece as I have never seen it
and am not familiar with its design.
It is unquestionably true that if the 914 described in the posting above
didn't have the rust stopped and the infected areas repaired the repair was
doomed as only a temporarily fix.  After these pieces are added to each
longitudinal the seams and welds should be sealed and the brace should be
painted and or undercoated to ensure moisture is kept out from between the
laminated areas.
The braces I have installed have definately "permanently" repaired 914s with
lower longitudinal problems and also restored lateral strength.  One car
(914-8) with good longitudinals received these pieces to provide additional
strength.  I would recommend them as a nice addition to cars that are
regularily taken to the track or have large displacement engines with
complimenting tires and wheels.
In closing the pieces I have used that are provided by Brad Mayeur are
definately not intended to be rust "coverups".  I guess it goes back to
fundamentals and I believe the correct installation of these parts can be a
definate benefit when restoring your 914 or adding some longitudinal support.
