Apparently hard to track down info.  I learned of them from the Bob Hoover
Sermons.  Most places ignored them on rebuild because a fresh head with new
guides doesn't really need them.  It is after the valve guides get some
wear and start to let some oil by that they help. See the Hoover Sermons
about them.

Some guys on the VW list have gotten them from local FLAPS by ordering the
size for the type 1 valves which I think was 7mm.  Our engines are
basically the type 4 though the 2.0L was not a stock VW head.  Still should
be able to find some if I knew the actual stem size.  I get a lot of cross
info being on both VW and 914 lists since the engines have so much in
common.

 Anyone out there with heads apart who could measure the valve stem size
for 2.0L?  George H.  any ideas?

I wasn't even aware that stem seals were available for our engines. They
aren't listed in automotion, for example.
