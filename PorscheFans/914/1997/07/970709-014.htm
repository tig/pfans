Cheaper fix:  borrow someone's underpowered, overweight clunker for several 
days.  You'll be amazed at how much more power your 914 has after a few days 
of not driving it!

Seriously, though, it sounds like you have a solution in search of a problem.

I,m trying to decide about having my 74 1.8 rebuilt. The engine  has 85K
miles and shows 120-125-125-125 compression. Doesn't seem to burn much oil.
Was thinking about Big Bore P/c's but now getting worried about cost v power
increase and possible problems with the fuel injection. Any thoughts?. Also I
don't have the time to do the rebuild and have been checking adds in
Excellence etc. It seems there is a wide variety of prices for a rebuild.
Some one mentioned that there are no "standards" in CA for a rebuild so you
don't know if they are going to replace all of the bearings, valves, etc. Is
this true? Do some places just put in new P/C's  and rod bearings?
Thanks
