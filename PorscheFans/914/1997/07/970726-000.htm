  Thanks for that info Dave.  I myself have never had one fail, but
I'm sure that it can happen, and your example is a case in point.

  I should also point out that I have never HAD to helicoil a spark
plug hole... I am a fanatic about oiling the threads and not
over-torqueing.  Even if I am caught by the side of the road, I will
pull the dipstick and get some oil to put on the plug threads.
   Of course, it only takes one "grease-monkey" to undo all of the
most cautious and dilligent efforts by the owner, so your point is
well-taken.

					Thanks,
                                                            Jim T.
