914ers,

The 914 died the other night.  After a little investigation along side the
road, I determined that the points were bad.  A little rubbing between the
contacts with a pocket knife, and I was on my way.  Luckily, I was only
about 3 miles from home.  

I removed the points tonight, and low and behold, they had a two little
burn nubs on both contacts.  What would be the cause of this?  The car is
dead-on 27 degrees BTDC and the dwell was perfect at 48 degrees (even at
3500 rpms).

Just more ammo for a pointless ignition.  Upon the suggestion of Jeff
Dunning, has anybody any experience with the Crane setup which includes
both pointless unit and coil?  Sorry, don't know the exact numbers.

Thanks,

Dion
