	The factory resistor is 270 Ohms, wattage unknown (but probably
pretty small, 1W should be more than enough).  If I remember the wording
of the ad correctly, they call it a "secret Factory fix", so I assume
that they use the resistor above, which was part of the early 2.0 (most
73, some 74) set-up.
	By itself, it will make the mixture a little richer throughout
the RPM & throttle range.  It will probably have more effect when the
engine is warm than when the engine is cool.  Unknown what effect that
will have on power, etc.
	I have one acquaintance who has used the AA kit on his 1.7, and
he said that it made a noticeable difference.  This on the "seat-of-the-
pants" dyno, of course.  I'm a little skeptical (on general principle)
because I know that the location of that dyno is very close to that of
the wallet that just shelled out for go-fast parts.
	If you're truly interested in more power from these sort of
tweaks, invest the $235 in a $2 Radio Shack potentiometer (0-500 Ohms or
so) and some dyno time.  Tweak away until the dyno says you're getting
max power, then measure the resistance across the pot.  Be sure to post
it here for the rest of us--especially if you have any of your race com-
petition here on the list!   ;^)
