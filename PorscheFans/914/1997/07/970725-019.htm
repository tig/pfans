Here's a long shot to think about for the weekend.  My rear window is
loose. Planned on remounting it when pull the interior for that part of the
project.  Back when I was having my 320i calipers machined, George Wright
and I were talking about the 914's and he mentioned the bad design of the
rear window, how they should have used a regular type rubber channel like
most other car windows use, with glass on the outside.  Just started
thinking since I was looking at the various rubber channels in the
JCWhitney catalog.

Anyone ever try to modify the rear window and use some type of rubber
channel to mount it?  Any details, proper type and source of the channel.

Any other creative ways of mounting it.  I've rear the instructions on the
914 Fan web page and that's what I was planning to do.  Just wondering how
long it will last since this car seems to have a fairly stiff ride.
