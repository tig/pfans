Gerard:
The words "overheating" and "914" are almost synonymous.  These cars don't
like to be kept sitting in traffic, or even waiting in a drive through line.
 Depending on the way your car is configured, you may notice several side
effects such as starting, idleing, or vapor locking problems.  The first
thing you need to do is make sure your
engine has all the necessary sheet metal and that all the insulating seals
are present and in good shape.  The principal to keep in mind with air cooled
engines is that there is a "hot side" and a "cool side".  Fresh air is drawn
into the engine compartment from the grill (cool side) and drawn through over
the cylinders and heads, and finally ejected  at the bottom of the car (hot
side).  The sheet metal and the rubber seals are what help keep these two
temperature regions thermodynamically isolated.  If there are any bad or
missing seals, the hot air and cold air mix, and the cooling becomes less
efficient - (sorta like running the A/C in your house with some of the
windows open).  Next, if it hasn't been done already,  relocate your fuel
pump to the front of the car (like the factory did in 75) - this helps
tremendously.  Finally - throw a couple of temperature gauges on the car for
insurance and peace of mind.  These are things
which I consider to be the basics for 914 overheating control.
