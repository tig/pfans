Yeh, It's Summer time - the season the 914 was designed for!  Anyone
that's got one that runs is driving the willies outta it right now.
Later this year, a lot of them will get moth-balled for the Winter, then
when Spring starts peaking around the corner, a lot of them won't run
anymore and the owner won't have the time/money/will power/whatever to
fix it up for another season so it goes up for sale.  Supply is always
higher in the Winter/early Spring months.

Depends on what you consider a 'basketcase'.  To me a 'basketcase' is a
car that is so far gone from rust or severe wreck-damage that it can not
be safely driven anymore (if at all!).  These are worth $500 - $1500
depending on engine, interior, accessories - good for parts only.  $3500
cars are fairly solid cars that you can buy and drive around and enjoy
without too much up-front work - straight bodies, not too much rust,
decent interiors.  $5-7k cars are rust-free with rebuilt engines,
restored interiors, re-done suspension and brakes, and great paint, and
all new rubber seals.

When you get ready to relinquish ownership of your 2 914s you'll find
that if you price them too high, lots of people will call, a few will
come and look, but the only person who's really interested is the 16year
old kid down the road who has $50 in savings and just has to figure out
how to come up with the other $3950.

Just my opinion.
