Here's what happened to me in my stupidity -- which caused the same problem.

Are you removing the screen cover on the mc reservoir?  If not, it sure
looks like you are filling the reservoir -- but you're not.  Thus you are
pumping bubbles INTO your brake system.

Once I realized what I was doing, and removed the screen (to see the actual
fluid in the reservoir), I had the entire system bled within 10 minutes.
