Wow Dirk you added a Barvarian to your fleet, cool.

Back on subject here, the articles are entertainment, that is it, most of
the info I had seen 27 times before.  I was hoping for details on the dry
sump install and some real HP numbers and the like. Maybe the case is not
as good as he hoped, but it should have been bolted together with the
raceware studs and see what is going on.

In the VW performance handbook, written way back in the early 70s the
engine build section states you will take the engine apart several times
to get everything correct.

Which brings up this tidbit of information.  VW oil pumps the gear is
pressed onto the shaft, and you have to adjust the shaft spacing to the
cam gear or else the gear will not have the correct clearance with the
cover.  You can press the shaft in and out of the gear, to set the proper
clearance depth.  This could also be the case with the High volume oil
pumps out there.

In my younger days I never gave the VW high performance book much
thought, it was contradictory to everything I ever read in a VW mag.  But
since I have matured a little, and searched for VW truth, this book is
spot on and is now a must read for me, before a rebuild.  Along with the
VW aircooled rebuild book.  Anyway, borrow it from the library and read
it, does not cover allot of the new technology, but does have a lot of
good info, still valid.  And would you know actually supports some
thoughts of Bob Hoover.

What I find interesting is the 914 Project theme comes back every 10
years or so.  They did one way back when in the 70s, painted it red, with
rivera mags and a ski rack, and a hella lights under the 2.0L limited
edition spoiler.

In the 80s the covered a 914 project which showed the latest offerings
including a set of 7x15s under stock fenders, with then a new custom
wheel.  And did actually test the items, it was a progressive project.

In the 90s it seems the projects have changed flavor, for the 914. But
then they are just show in each case the products of their advertisers. 
Only know the ads and the articles are not as far apart as they once
where.

Take care,
