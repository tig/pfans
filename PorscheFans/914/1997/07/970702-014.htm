STOCK BODIED 914s

Although the cars will vary slightly the space between the inner fender and
the outer fender is about 9 and 1/2 inches.  I have experimented with 15 and
16 inch wheels and can tell you the following:
- Tire diameters and overall widths are different for each manufacturor.  Do
your research and find out the mounted dimensions before deciding on a tire
wheel combination.
- The factory 911, 6 by 16 inch Fuchs wheel works well with 205/45,50,55
series tires up front.  Ride height and alignment may restrict some
lock-to-lock turning but in most cases these tires will be fine.  5 and 1/2s
in the 15 inch size will also be fine with these tires.
- 7 inch factory Fuchs will not fit the rear of the 914 without some fender
or trailing arm modification.  15 and 16 inch wheels will rub the outer
fender lip unless you pull the fender (don't) or narrow the trailing arms.
I am in the process of doing this (narrowing the trailing arms) to fit the
7X16 911 Fuchs in back and I will be happy to let everyone how it goes.
 Sadly the tire combinations are very limited for the 16 inch wheel and tires
that would fit the 7 incher nicely are limited to 205s and 215s.
 Additionally only two major tire makers are building a 215 in a 16 inch
tire.  As much as I would like to mount a 225 series tire the thinnest I have
found available (Pirelli P7000) is 8.7 inches.  That leaves only .8 inches to
split for inner and outer clearance.    
My suggestion would be to stay with a 15 by 6 inch wheel and use  205s up
front with matching 215s in the rear.  A good suggestion for tire height is
to stay above 24 inches unless ride isn't a concern.

GT FLARED 914s

Wheel sizes for Fuchs can be 8s and 9s if you want.  I like 7 and 8s and 7s
and 9s.  The reason I like 7s in front is they are easier to move and they
provide adequate tire on the ground in a 45,50 or 55 series tire.  You can
use a 245 in the rear with 9s and they look great.  A flared 914 with
225/50/16s (on 8s) up front and 245/45/16s in the rear is a very aggressive
looking car.  

Good luck......Rich
