James:

I just love the universality of the 914 ownership experience. I don't
know what causes YOUR low idle, I've caused it a number of ways in my
own car. I've learned to look for broken wires to the temp sensors Head
and intake, etc. whenever I get unexplained changes that are not
supposed to happen (like no start after replacing a fuel hose!). The
wires are brittle and easily broken when you push stuff aside to get at
something.

Did you check the timing? Timing has a much bigger effect on idle than
the mixture setting. Something tells me it might be the manifold temp
sender connection, the one by the distributor, but it's so vague I can't
remember why. Everything has failed on my car at least once, and it's
hard to keep all the symptoms and cures straight in my head.

Finally, yes you need a CO meter to adjust the mixture setting, but you
can come real close by backing it off until the idle hunts up and down
then enrich it until the idle just smooths out, then a little more.

I hope somebody has better advice than this.
