Today I went to start the car, and it made the same "clunk" as before
when I tried to "bump" it.  I pulled the dip stick, and sure enough,
there was gas in the oil...lots.

So I never left the key on as I thought, but somehow gas is pouring
itself into the engine, as well as oil leaking past some type of seal.

I did forget to mention that there's a Holley 5200 on the car.  I
thought it had leaked a little fuel from the main gasket (which I plan
to replace), but I have no clue.

Thanks for any help
