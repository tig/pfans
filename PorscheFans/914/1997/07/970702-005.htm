Having driven both, and currently owning both, I go for the 914 as a track car, for the following reasons:
1. Stock 944 class is very full
2. Cost to repair on 944 is a lot more than 914
3. If you bend body on 914, you can take all the good stuff off and swap to a new roller (Body) cheaply
4. You can do all the work on a 914 yourself with over the counter tools. (The belt adj. Tool for 944 is $350)
5. You can put 911 motor in 914 as big as your pocket book will buy, if you Feel the need for speed.
6. It is easy to tow (Flat tow is workable)

That's my $.02, plus we can always use another J stock racer

Howdy,

I am considering a track car for driving schools and PCA events, and
possibly SCCA or NASA events in the future.  I like the 944 and 914s prices
as an inexpensive platform to begin with.  Does one car out perform the
other?  Are they equally competitive?  I might also consider BMW 2002s
(obviously not for PCA events, but BMW CCA.)  So what advice can you folks
offer me?

One other thing, I need to be able to drive this car on the street!  I
don't see a truck in my near future....

TIA (please reply directly),
