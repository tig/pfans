Gosh, I feel honored. :) I think.... :}

WOAH!!!

You should not need to use more than maybe 1.5L of brake fluid for a
complete and thorough flushing.

Even mopre simply than that, they draw air in around the bleed nipple.
It's very hard to get a very good seal on the nipple for these things to
work well. As a result, it's nearly impossible to tell if teh air you're
drawing in is coming from the brake system or not. But yes, vacuum
bleeders, in my experience, are unreliable.

I have had mixed results with pressure bleeders. My conclusion was that
they too were unreliable.

Ok, lets define some terms here. At least how _I_ define them. 

Bleeding: extracting air and water contaminated fluid that resides NEAR
the calipers. 
Flushing: complete exchange of old fluid for new fluid in the entire
system. 

When bleeing OR flushing, definately start at the furthest caliper
first. Right Rear, then Left Rear, then Right Front, and then Left
Front.

My technique for flushing may be a bit weird, but it has proven
extreemly effective. I buy two types of fluid, one is Motul 600 degree
racing fluid (yellow), and the other is Ate super blue. Both are very
high temp fluids, and require frequent exchanges because of the
hydophilic nature of high temp brake fluids. Anyway, I alternate the two
brands and because one is yellow and the other blue, I can tell when the
line has been thoroughly flushed. It goes from yellow, to green, to
blue, and presto! No excess fluid used on guesswork. And as a result I
use significantly less than a _gallon_ of brake fluid. And this is
expensive brake fluid here, so I'm inclined to save as much of my money
as I can. Also, draw out as much of the old fluid from the reseviour as
you can and replace it with new stuff, this will mean less time bleeding
to get the new fluid down to the master.

Yup. Once you start however, it should not take very long to get all
four corners anyway.

Anoying little sucker. Very easy to get to when the front left wheel is
still off. A PITA when the wheel is on and the car is back on the
ground, meaning you forgot about it untill you went to start the car.

Can't rule out the brakes, but I'd suspect the master cyl. But if the
master provides pressure when pumping the pedal and bleeding the system,
then it's working at least reasonably well.
