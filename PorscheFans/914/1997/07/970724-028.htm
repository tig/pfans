	The Helicoil is simply a coil which you screw into the
stripped hole after tapping new threads into that hole.  The coil
acts as the threads for whatever you put in there next.
	[Vast oversimplification:]
	You can think of a Timesert as a nut that you put *into* the
piece of metal that you've stripped the hole in.  Almost as if you
took a big hammer and pounded the nut in so that its hole is where
the now-stripped hole was.  Of course, the real thing differs from
a nut in many ways, and if you try just buying one and whacking it
with a hammer it will do you more harm than good...
	The "time" part of the name supposedly comes from the fact
that the threads in the insert are not completely uniform (they're
"timed", get it?  No, I don't either.), and are supposed to hold the
stud or nut better than regular-cut threads.  Sort of like a lock
nut.
