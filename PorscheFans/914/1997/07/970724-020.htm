Not to flame, but is what you report below firsthand (we know who had the 
problems and they could be contacted for additional info) or "urban legend?"

I wouldn't be using this engine for daily driving, just to, from, and at 
autocrosses.

The cost differential between a set of p/c's and a six conversion is just too 
great in my world to consider them both as "apples."  Going to carbs is doable 
in a lot of states and in 5-10 years (with luck) more states won't bother 
testing our "historics."

Anyway, I'd like more actual data if anyone has any.

I have no direct experience, but I can tell you what I've learned.
Basically, 103mm P&C's are a bad idea for the street for several reasons.
These include the fact that it is difficult/impossible to increase the
cooling capacity of the engine, if you install larger valves to match the
larger pistons, the head will crack, and others that I can't think of right 
now. . . .
