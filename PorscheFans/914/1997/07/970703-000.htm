  My FI handy hints book says that a 680 ohm resistor is a good (engine warm) 
substitute for the temp sensor II in the head near #3 cylinder, which sounds like your 
trouble.   My suggestion would be to go to Radio Shack and procure a 680 ohm 
(color code blue-gray-brown) 1 watt resistor (half watt would probably be OK but 1 
watt resistors are sturdier) and fit it (best if soldered) with an appropriate connector 
to connect to the wiring harness in place of the temp sensor II wire.  Ground the 
other end to a GOOD ground (battery negative terminal is fine, but will require that 
you solder a long enough wire to get there onto the other end of the resistor) and try 
starting the engine.  Of course, warm the car up  before you do this.  If it won't start 
with the temp sensor II connected, but will with the resistor,  replace temp sensor II.  

  Alternatively, you could measure the value of the resistance of temp sensor II to 
ground using a good ohmmeter when the engine is hot.   It should be in the 
neighborhood of 500 to 800 ohms.  Much more than this and it is bad.

                                        Good Luck,
                                        Jim T.
