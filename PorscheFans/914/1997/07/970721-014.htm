On a 914-4 and 6 and some others the rear calipers have adjusting screws
to set the initial pad to disc clearance.  But the fronts are of a more
conventional design, much like your 912 calipers.  See the 914 uses a
rear caliper with a built in mechanical parking brake, where the 911
series used a set of drum brake pads for the parking brake.  So much like
a drum brake you have to set the venting clearance in order for proper
operation of the rear disc system.
