<pre>
a lot more 1.7 & 2.0 people than us 1.8er's. Well I reached a fellow 
member who helped out tremendously, both parts and advice (thanks Pat ) 
I hooked the white signal wire for the injectors to the 15 or hot side 
of coil, thats where the trouble was  . Of couse I found out this 
information after I fried two injectors by running 12 volts staight up. 
I was going to run a reheistat (sp?) to lower the voltage but got lazy 
.. Now I am lighter in the wallet. Well time to finish some small 
details and drive my 914 for the first time. (The car was given to me 
with a blown motor) 
P.S. It is amazing how much a free car can end up costing you, I have 
yet to smog it and I feel the wallet start to open up spillng out more 
of my hard earned cash.
