Greetings Jeff and 914-er's!

  Jeff asks:

> What are the common wire sizes

  I finally got around to this after the second posting by Dave D...
he set me to thinking about what would be required.... his table idea
was much better than than what I was originally going to post, and
when he asked for refinements, I posted another table.  It should be
on the list by the time you get this.

> Also recall someone mentioning the best type of wire, something
about
> teflon? lined or coated. Something like that? 

  Teflon wire (the chemical name in front of a wire, or a designation
like THHN refers to the insulation)  is good stuff.  Also hard to
find... only at the better stocked electronic supply houses.   It may
be hard to find in gauges suitable for automotive use.  It is
difficult to find a wide variety of colors.  It also requires a
precision stripper (or a thermal stripper) to strip well without
nicking.  If you go the thermal stripper route (VERY expensive tool,
by the way) be sure to have lots of ventilation....    by the time
you get teflon insulation hot enough to melt / cut, it is decomposing
into phosgene gas (WW I  chemical agent).  Last but not least, teflon
wire is EXPENSIVE!   
   Other than the drawbacks I have just mentioned, it's fabulous
stuff.  It is practically impervious to heat (requires in excess of
800 degrees F to decompose) so that you can lay a soldering iron
right on it and it won't melt.  It is also impervious to chemical
attack... of course most modern plastics are pretty resistant to oil
and battery acid, but teflon is for sure... and it does not seem to
decay with age, as so many other plastics do.  This is why they use
it in the space program... and not in cars.

  It's up to you... to paraphrase... Fancy wire costs money... how
fancy do you want to get?

					Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
