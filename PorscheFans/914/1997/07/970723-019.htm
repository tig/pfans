Subject: re: Texas emissions laws (repost)

I too live in Dallas county and have to get the test.

I had my 89 Nissan PU (108K) pass, but I doped the gas with a product
made
by Slick 50 advertizing passing emissions.  The year before, the
inspector,
who was cool, fooled around with different things and made it pass by
the
skin of it's teeth.  The year before that, I failed.

After doping the gas, it put out less hydrocarbons then when it was new.
Amazing stuff.

I learned from the cool inspector a few things to do before taking in
for a
inspection:

1.  Change the oil and oil filter.  (This makes a big difference.  Go to
Synthetic if possible, it's even cleaner.)

2.  Change the air filter, fuel filter, PCV Valve and blast the thoats
with
Carb cleaner.

3.  Tank up with the highest octane fuel for more oxygenation, which
produces cleaner exhaust.

4.  Idle up the idle speed to just under 1200 RPM.  (Anything higher is
not
low RPM idle, thats where most people fail during the phases of the
test.
The higher the idle, under 1200, the more the pellets in the cat
converter
move around and remove bad stuff from the exhast helping a pass
situation.)

5.  Retard the timing.

6.  My personal favorite, dope the gas.
