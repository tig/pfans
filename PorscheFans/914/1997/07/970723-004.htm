Yeah, my wife twisted my arm to buy it. I really wanted another Porsche (a
912), but this car is in great shape and it was only 1,500$. Now I just need
to pay down my credit card so I can have enough room to take a deep breath
and order a pair of webers for the straight six. It still has those Zeniths
on it. It's a really nice car, from california, restored and with only
120,000 miles on it. Engine was rebuilt, too. Interior is nearly perfect. It
has a few rust bubbles and couple of dings, also. The bad part is that this
new car is going to take away from "face time" with my 914. But, we needed
wheels while the 2002 is in the body shop, so I neede to buy *something*.
Bavarias are so undervalued that I couldn't walk away. Plus, the people in
the bavaria club have a wacky sense of humor. Bavs are mechanically
identical to the highly prized CS coupes and only weigh hundred pounds more.

Yeah, Raceware should have said to the guy "whoa dude, take it apart and
find the problem!" The article kindof makes Raceware look foolish, in my
opinion. I should email them about it, probably. I guess I expect too much
from these rags. What's the name of the VW high performance book you
referred too?
