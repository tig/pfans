Jeff,

Thanks for the congrats.  I didn't plan on replacing the fuel lines through
the tunnel,
after what happened one day, I sorta had to.

A friend of mine came over to reweld my clutch tube back up to the rear
firewall, when one of the lines caught on fire.  There was no fuel in the
tank, but the residuals in the line were still there causing the small
burn.  From what we could tell, it was the return line, and since I don't
have it hooked up with a carbed car, we didn't worry.  Well it was the
supply line, and I quickly found out after putting the tank back in and
pouring my first gallon of fuel in.

I pulled the hard plastic line back through the inside of the firewall,
attempting the fix it through one of the access holes.  The problem was the
age of the lines.  Everytime I would try to bend it up through the access
hole to repair it, the line would kink and split.  I finally got
frustrated, pulled the tank back out, removed the rubber grommet which
holds the lines through the front bulhead, and pulled the old plastic lines
right through the tunnel.  I replaced the line with high pressure braided
rubber hose and used the existing clips in the tunnel to hold it secure.
It seems to be working just fine.

If you attempt to do this, pull the shift lever out.  You'd be surprised
how much more access it gives you.
Total time = 1 to 1.5 hours.
Good luck,

Dion
