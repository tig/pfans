That's about the price for a nice 86-944T, maybe a bit lower.

The interesting information is the 944's are on the bottom side of the 
price curve (that is they are dirt cheap) and the 914's are going back up. 
 Time cures all (old stock market tip).

As an owner of both cars, I can tell you that the 944 is a great car to 
drive, and the motor is solid. BUT every thing on the 944 cost a lot more 
than a 914 part, body work is not cheap, etc..

BEST REASON to start with a 914 is the brain, yours !

When you start racing, you have a lot to learn. Any fool can drive a car 
around a track at speed. But racing is learning to drive the sh-t out of a 
car, keeping it and yourself together, while you plot and scheme to get by 
that son_of_bit- who qualified ahead of you, or who snuck under you in the 
last turn, or out broke you and got you on the inside.

This is not an easy sport, and it is very dangerous, people die racing ! I 
think the best way to learn is with a car that is not real fast, 
predictable, and cheap to repair. The 944T is none of the above.

Give up the ideal of a buying a fast car to start with and learn your craft 
and then move into the big boys, and don't give me any of that "but I have 
been drivers Ed'ing for years" it ain't even close.

Subject:	Price of 944T

Hello,

I am planning on puchasing a 944 in the next two months or so.  I figured
I'd just get a standard 944, but I saw something in the Auto Trader, that
has given me additional hope.  There was an '86 944T for only $6K.  Is this
a reasonable price, or should I expect this car was thrashed?  What does
one usually sell for?  I want to get one for PCA club racing, so the
interior isn't too important, but good mechanicals are.  Good paint is
always a bonus!  So, how much should I expect to pay for a 944T.  I assume
I can get a nice 944 (non-turbo) for under $5K.

Now, what about the 914?

TIA,
