Back in '91, we were taking our stock '74 914 ("Schnell Kurbis") out for a 
warm summer evening's drive with the top off.  It's wasn't the 4th, really, 
but a day or two before.

As we neared a stopsign, we noticed several teenage boys across the 
intersection.  We had almost come to a stop when they lit off a "helicopter" 
firework which spins its way up 30-40' on a ball of flame.  I was stopped at 
the sign when I looked up and saw it coming straight down at me, but I hadn't 
checked traffic to know if I could turn safely.  As I was proceeding around 
the corner slowly with my head forward so it didn't hit me in the face, the 
firework fell between my back and the seat.

Having the 914's seatbelts on - as always - proved "dangerous."  I leaned 
forward to keep the hot cinder off my back, but this engaged the inertia reel 
which made it impossible to move farther forward or to release the catch.  I 
remember shouting almost nonstop to my wife, "Get it out!  Get it out!"  She 
was doing her darndest to reach between me and the seat to fling it out, but I 
couldn't move forward much and when I did the hot coal fell farther down.  I 
could smell something burning and was in a genuine full-bore adreneline panic.

I got to the side of the street and dumped the clutch with my foot on the 
brake to quickly kill the motor.  I leaned back enough to disengage the belt 
and hopped out.  By that time what was left was barely warm, but I was still 
going ballistic.  I remember running over to the kids and giving my impression 
of the scariest drill sargeant I'd ever met - hands stiffly down at my side, 
leaning forward so my arms were pointed rearward (I wasn't going to hit them), 
and using every ounce of "command voice" I could muster.  I don't remember 
what I said, but a lot of it was rhetorical - "What's the MATTER with YOU?" 
and "You think that was FUNNY?" kind of stuff.

It must have taken me a full thirty minutes to resume normal breathing.  I was 
still pumped when the cops got there and that took at least twenty.

The damage wasn't as great as the fear, however.  There was one 1/4" hole in 
the seat and several other places the pattern had melted, and I had a 
corresponding 1/4" hole in my shirt.  My skin was slightly burned (no 
blisters), but subsequent drives down that same street still makes my heart 
beat hard and fast.  And although I never was a fireworks nut, I have even 
less interest in being around them since then.

Looking for a morale?  How about, "Never go topless near the 4th of July?"  I 
don't really have a morale to offer, but the story is true and it's about a 
914 experience - and it may be considered by some to be too long - so I 
thought I'd share it.  Consider it the guest editorial for this month's 
virtual magazine.

Best wishes for a safe 4th.

P.S.:  Somebody should be archiving this stuff for a "Best of 914 Email" book. 
 There must be at least a hundred of us crazy enough to buy anything with 914 
in the title, right?
