  I had the same concerns when I first fired up my 914 after a top-end-only overhaul, 
and so I ran straight 30 weight (Castrol) which is what Porsche recommends in their 
914 owner's manual.   Unfortunately, the oil pressure descended practically to 
nothing when the engine warmed up.   I switched to Castrol GTX 20-50, and that 
helped the pressure quite a bit; it's not fabulous, but there's enough showing on the 
gauge that I'm fairly sure that everything is getting lubricated.

  The viscosity change had no effect whatsoever on either the oil temperature or the 
CHT... the oil temp is the stock uncalibrated gauge, but it never seems to get more 
than 1/8" or so above the lower end of the scale.  CHT has been running 
325 to 350 F  both before and after.  I am in the high desert of California with ambient 
air temperatures in the high 90's during the day (summertime).

  My guess is that at Porsche engine temperatures, the oil is thin enough to go 
through the cooler circuit no matter what you run, unless maybe you put Swepco in 
the crankcase!

                              Regards,
                              Jim T.
