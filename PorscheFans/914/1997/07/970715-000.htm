This is rather interesting.  I wouldn't think that leaving the key in
the "On" position could flood the engine.  Isn't there a little relay
that controls just how long the fuel pump runs when the key is turned to
the "On" position?  Maybe it's blown, but if that were the case, then I
would figure that the fuel pump wouldn't run at all.  I would get the
car hooked up to an exhaust gas analyzer so you could make sure that the
smoke isn't a result of a super-rich running condition first.  Is the
smoke continuous, or does it only appear when you blip the throttle, or
when you let off?  I can't imagine that you did any major damage, since
the car probably wouldn't run very well right now.  Also, if you had
broken any rings, I would imagine that there would be remnants of them
in the oil/gas combo you drained from the car.  Maybe I'm just being a
little too optimistic, but I think you'll be O.K.  You may just need to
drive it for a while to get all of the oil to burn out of the exhaust.
You could pull the exhaust and clean in yourself, but after several
problems with my exhaust, I wouldn't recommend pulling it unless you're
certain that you can get it to re-seal without stripping any studs.

Good luck, and keep us posted!
