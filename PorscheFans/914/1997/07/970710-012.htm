HAH! <snicker>. No seriously, I'm glad that you're planning on cometing
in Solo2 with a 914. We need more 914s back in the SCCA.

But before I set off on this, I have to preface anything I say regarding
competition designs on a car with "READ THE RULES!". If you are buying a
car, or madifying an existing one, for the intended purpose of competing
with it. Read the rules that apply to your car and class that you are
choosing. Seeimingly minor modifications may bump you into a class where
you had no intentions of going or paying for.

> What is the best car for this?

Any car driven by Jeff Reitmier or Bob Tunnell. ;) 

Actually, what class do you plan on competing in? B-Stock? C-Street
Prepared? A-Prepared? D-Prepared? Or D or E-Mod? This is important to
consider before you go ahead and buy a car that might not be the best
one for what you will have to do to it.  

You emphasised _competetive_, so I'll assume that means on the national
level. Before you have dreams of grandure of hopping into a "sleeper"
car and winning nationals, realise this. The 914 has been competetive in
Solo2 since the national program was first started in the 70s. And since
then, it has been moved from class to class more than any other model.
That's because someone hops in the car and spanks the competition so
badly that the car gets moved into a more difficult stock class. -Or- it
is so feared that it is placed in a class where there is no chance for
it to be an overdog, and it'll have to struggle terribly hard to just be
competetive. So, let's look at the national level.

B-Stock: You will be beset upon by Miatas on all sides. The 914 was
bumped into B-stock last year along with the Miatas. Unfortunately,
B-stock has pretty much become a spec car class at national levels. The
spec car being a 1.8L Miata. You will need to be a seriously good, make
that great, driver to compete with the Miata on a national level. And
just to give you an idea, Steve Compton, a long time 914 die hard and
SCCA autoxer, feels that the 914 is hard pressed to keep up with the
Miatas at the national level. And he _is_ a great driver.

C-Street Prepared: The 914 may have potential here, but not without
cost. A nationally competetive 914 _may_ be possible in this class, but
only with alot of time and money. I started down this particular road a
few years ago and am still going, with quite a bit more to go. On the
local level (depending on where you live) the 914 may have a pretty good
chance in C/SP. On the national level, the 914 is out powered, Sometimes
by well over 100hp. The 914s advantage is speed maintenance, and getting
that down is a matter of driver skill _and_ experience. Not to mention
car prep. C-Street Prepared is potentially a very expensive class. But
it's a h*ll of alot of fun to play in. I'd be delighted to see a new
C/SP 914 out there.

A or D Prepared: The 914 2.0 was moved into AP, a death blow as far as I
can tell. AP is the realm of the Lotus, none save a Loti may pass the
gates of the class guardian. Lotus (Loti?) have pretty much dominated AP
on the national level since the 70s. DP on the other hand may very well
be the place for a 1.8L 914 to shine. But don't go into Prepared unless
you have a -big- bank account that you're willing to make very small. A
fully built Prepared class motor will cost you significantly more than
the car did.

And then there's Modified: Major Bigus Buckus! 'nuff said?

> I was first told that a 70 is best because its so much lighter.

If you're building for Prepared or Modified, then an earlier car isn't a
bad idea. Keep in mind that if you do this, the only thing you will wind
up keeping from the original car is the bare chassis. Otherwise...

> Others told me the 2.0 was the car to have.

If you're going for Stock then get a '73 2.0, or a '74 2.0 with the
sport option. If you're going for Street Prepared, any 2.0 will do and
then you can backdate to lighter bumpers and ditch the smog stuff if
it's legal to do so in your state. If you live in CA, get a '73 or '74
as the '75 and '76 914s come with smog pumps and catalytic converters
that you will not (yet) be able to remove legally.

> 2.      What years were the 2.0s built?  Ive found several here in SoCal and
> they range in year from 71-76.  71 seemed kind of early to me...

1970-1976.  The 2.0s were built only from 1973-1976, that's it. I'm sure
someone will point you to Dave Darling's FAQ on the 914. It should help
answer alot of your 914 questions.

> 3.      What prices are fair for a 914 2.0 and 1.7 in daily driver condition?

Depends on how much you're willing to invest in prepping and restoring
the car.
A '73 or '74 2.0 will fetch considerably more money than a 1.7 or 1.8. I
bought my '74 2.0 for $3500 and it still needed a good bit of work, but
the chassis was straight and pretty much rust free, and the engine had
good compression and leakdown. That was all I was concerned with at the
time. There is very little left on that car that was there when I bought
the car over 3 years ago, body panels as well.

> Thanks for all the help...

Anytime. Feel free to ask any questions you need. That's what's great
about this list. :)

BTW, I am resonably competetive in my region in the CSP open class. But
that's only because the nationally competetive "hot-shoes" run in their
own "handicapped" class, appart from the open classes.
