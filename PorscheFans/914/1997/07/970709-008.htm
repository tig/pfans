Hi guys,

Hope everyone had a good 4th; it's taking me quite a while to get back
into the swing of things.  I've got some more questions; hopefully
these will be easy to answer.

1) Is there an easy way to externally identify the type of chain tensioners
   on a 911 engine.  I'm playing around a bit with the engine I plan to plug
   into my conversion, and I notice some oil lines running to the tensioner
   covers; I'm hoping that means they are the late style Carrera hydraulic
   tensioners.  Is there anyway to visually distinguish these from the other
   older types?

2) I was trying to remove some spare exterior door handles from a parts car
   so I could get at the locks for re-keying.  In the process, I broke the
   stud that holds the door handle "tang" to the door skin; this is the stud
   that is right near the edge of the door.  The nut is still tightly fastened
   to the bolt, but any attempts to turn it just result in turning the stud,
   which appears to be just spinning in the tang (must be some weld or casting
   that broke).  Any ideas on how to get the handle off?

TIA,
Mike
