I can share a bit of recent experience with my 2.0 rebuild: the intent
was a combo street & weekend for-fun "racer" 

(it WAS a $2500 car when i bought it 4 yrs ago)

used a webcam 91H (hydraulic) which has good low end torque but really
"comes on" about 3500 & will rev to 6800, using MSHP reconditioned heads
w/ HD valve springs & SS valves, stock crank, balanced the rods,  new
"stock" 7.6 p&c's & 8.5 CR, so IT RUNS ON STREET GAS... 

created a 9 lb flywheel per Rich Bontempi model & balanced it w/clutch
assy AFTER the engine was together (not every shop has the eqpt to bal
these flywheels)(expect to spend at least $150 to get the machine & bal
work done) .. used a new carbon clutch disk & PP from automotion which i
had orig'ly bought for the sixer, (the combo of the machined flywheel &
PP was W-A-A-Y off balance...) (just lightening & balancing these 2
pieces will make ANY engine rev better & smoother & last longer)

downside: the cam has so much overlap that idle vacuum is low & the
d-jet runs rich which means it will never pass a CA smog test, but it
goes like H...! ... the fan belt leaves, somewhere up there around
6500...

i've also done many suspension mods, bmw brakes, etc, & somedays i think
it might be as fun as my sixer on the track... (in which, I have been
lapped by Glenn Hills' 4-cyl !!) ( but I'll never drive as well as
Glenn, no matter what my ride...)(.. cheers here for Dan Freedman's
comments about "craft"!)

It's NOT a $2500 car anymore. like most of you, I just love to drive it
& i built it with the intention of driving my "investment" out of it..
(but $4500 might get my attention only cuz now i need to rebuild or
replace the sixer motor..) i've never had any other sportscar that is as
much "toss it around" fun & i live 17 miles of twisty-mountain-road off
the interstate... AND

 time seems to have healed the "ugly duckling" affliction the 914 once
had... my S.O. (who drives a Shelby GT350 vintage racer) has noted that
the 914 "turns heads" when we drive it... now, in a world of jellybean
cars, it stands out as crisp & "racy" looking & i find a surprising
number of people recognize it as a "Porsche" & ask about it... this is
almost nirvana!

MY answer to the question about how to improve the 914 & where to spend
the $$$ is....   the question you get asked when you go into the
computer store...."What do you want to do with it...?"  & second: "how
soon do you want it to be on the street???" & third: "are you doing the
work yourself or have you got deep pockets?"
