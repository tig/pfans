	I tried to send this direct, but my mail system couldn't get
through to the original sender.

	Otto's is an outfit down in Southern California that does a lot
of 914 work.  They have *lots* of parts, are very knowledgeable, etc.
They advertise in "the usual places", including Panorama (national PCA
magazine; if you're not a PCA member you should become one!), Excellence,
and European Car (formerly VW & Porsche Magazine).
	If you can get on the Web, Tim's Fan Page has a bit about them--
Tim bought a complete car from them and was quite impressed.
