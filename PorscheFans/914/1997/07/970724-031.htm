	Yes, Virginia, there *is* life after Smog II.  Me and my Gross
Polluter are now officially registered.  YAAAY!
	You may recall that I had been monkeying around with my FI to
see if I could get the car to pass.  After the first failure, I fixed
up a couple of wires in the FI harness and replaced the manifold pres-
sure sensor with one from my "Big Box o' FI Parts".  I also did a valve
adjust, an ignition system tune-up, and replaced every vaccuum hose on
the low-pressure side.  The new sensor seemed to make the car run better.
	Unfortunately, it was the wrong part--it also made the car run
very VERY rich.  That was a major culprit in failing the second check.
	After substituting the original sensor back in (both of the two
from the "Big Box" were the wrong part!) I tinkered with everything for
a while.  I still could not get the car to "feel" correct.
	So I took Baby on in to Tony, my mechanic.  He replaced two of
my FI wiring fixes (two of the ground connections), and gave the car a
tune-up.  Adjusted the valves, and among other things, replaced the
points.  Which were fairly pitted.  Hmmm...  And those were just about
new!
	After he was done, the idle CO was right on the Porsche spec
(3%), which is lower than the state limit (5%).  Idle HC was good as
well, and 2500 RPM emissions were half or less of the allowed numbers.
	Yeah!  You gotta love a competent mechanic with the right tools!
I wish I could afford the $20,000 or so for one of those exhaust gas
analyzers.  (Of course, if I could, I'd put it down on a Boxster...)
	The good news is that the Referee didn't give me any flack about
not having any engine serial number.  Either they don't bother checking,
or they give up looking after a little while if the engine "looks"
correct.
	Now I can drive it again!  Yeah!
