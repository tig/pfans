I have probably done the dumbest thing I have ever done....

I got up one day last weekend (the day after I finally passed
inspection), and proceeded to try to start my '70 914.  

It didn't want to turn over.  I thought I had left something on, and
being a dumb-ass, I attempted to bump start it down my rather steep
driveway.  No luck.  Also, I smelt gas.

To make a long story short...I had left something on...the key in the
"on" position, and the fuel pump dumped a quater tank of gas into the
oil and out the exhaust, etc.  I dumped the oil(gas), took out the
plugs, turned it over to blow out the engine, changed the filter, spark
plugs, put in new oil, and started it up.  It ran, but now it blows
smoke like a mother, and oil is literally dripping out of the exhaust.  
I'm afraid I blew something pretty bad.  I drove the car, and the funny
thing is that it drove great; it pulled real nice and seemed to
accelerate better than ever.  That's before I looked in the rear view
mirror and saw the cloud.  

Would anyone have an idea of the kind of damage I did?  I would think
that if the rings were blown, and compression were bad, I could tell by
driving it...but like I said, it seemed to have more power than usual. 
The only other thing I did is install a Weltmister oil trap...but that
doesn't seem like it could be the cause.

Thanks for any help.
