  There's an old saying:  "If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"   Your engine doesn't sound 
broken to me.

  There are a few places that do sterling quality work;  I think that we have a couple 
of people on this list who work on Porsches for a living, but otherwise, one never 
knows just exactly  what one is going to get.   There is one known value in the 
equation:  your engine currently runs, and seems OK.   I would think long and hard 
before I turned a functional engine over to someone with whom I had no experience 
and told him to overhaul it.

  If you have the bucks, buy a core engine and get that overhauled / upgraded.  
Then, if it doesn't work out, or the next time that you have to pass smog, you can just 
drop your original back in and you have a known quantity.

  Just my  $.02 worth.

                                        Regards,
                                        Jim T.
