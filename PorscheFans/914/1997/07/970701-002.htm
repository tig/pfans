I was out of town for a while, and then the garage was packed with
camping equipment, so I haven't had a chance to work on my 914's wiring
problems... until last night.  I re-did the connection from the head
temp sensor to the brain, and traced the four wires from the brain to
the MPS just to make sure that I fixed them correctly when they broke
last year, and that I didn't have the connection backwards.  Well,
everything with the MPS checked out (all of the wires are in the right
order).  I started the car, and was not greeted by a cloud of smoke.
Blipping the throttle resulted in a small amount of smoke, but nothing
like the clouds I mentioned before.  Unfortunately, moving the wires
around still results in erratic engine behavior including misfiring.  I
inspected everything I could see, and I cannot see any loose or poor
connections anywhere.  After the engine warmed up a bit (about 5
minutes), the smoke progressively got worse until the large clouds were
once again filling my garage.  I'm guessing that this is because the
engine is running way rich, and when the Aux. Air Regulator was open (I
don't have the cold start valve hooked up), the mixture wasn't as rich.
However, once it closed, the mixture lacked that additional air and
became quite rich.  Does this theory make sense?  After moving the wires
around, it doesn't appear that it's just one loose connection.  It
almost seems like 4 or 5 of the wires are broken inside their casings.
The other thing that concerns me is how tight the plug fits into the
MPS.  I'm suspicious of this replacement plug and its ability to make a
solid connection with the MPS.  Can someone give me a source for
replacement MPS plugs?  Short of replacing the entire harness (anyone
have one?), I'm not sure what else I can do...

Thanks again for everyone's help!
