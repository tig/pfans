That all depends on what you want to do with the car. Is this just for
fun and occasional drivers ed events? Then do what you want. If you
intend on actuall competition, then read the rules for the club and
class you want to run in. A seemingly minor mod can put you into a class
with (as I like to call them) trailer-riding-fire-breathing-monsters.

Sure, why not. A street 914 can handle up to 9.0:1 CR with additional
oil cooling.

Yup, but that really does do you any good if you don't have a race cam
and crank in there. The cam poops out at around 5,500rpm and there's
really no power past that. Venturi grind is not a bad way to go, better
flow. Next best is a 5-angle cut that will still give you better flow
while retaining some turbulence for low rpm efficiency.

Figure out what you intend to do with the car, then go from there.
