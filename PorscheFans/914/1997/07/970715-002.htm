Yesterday I posted the message that is tagged at the end, in response to
a comment Bernie made back on 7-10, regarding VII (Viscosity Index
Improvers) in a specific Mobil product.

I would now like to update my comment.  I have it on excellent authority
(read - from Mobil's expert engineers) that there is NO multi viscosity
oil produced, synthetic / conventional / blend etc. that lacks VIIs. 
Yes, that includes their products.  If it's a multi-vis it has VIIs (if
you don't understand what I'm saying, go back and look for my previous
discussion on the VIIs and their inportance in multi-vis blend recipes). 
If it's a single-grade then it very possibly doesn't have VII's, or has a
very low volume of VII.  

So, the statement that their multi-vis product(s) lack VIIs is totally
incorrect.

They were pretty hot when I forwarded that little quote/statement on to
them, and they were emphatic with me, wanting me to set straight a group
like ours, which CAN have great influence on the general buying public. 
Believe it or not, a specialized group like ours (Porsche Nuts in
general, possibly racing oriented, and then the 914 Nuts in particular)
holds much influence because our peers look at us as if we are THE gurus
because they assume we do much research to know what is THE latest and
THE best.  The people who run the marketing segments of these big
companies know that we're looked at that way, AND they tend to cater
their advertising toward us, to influence us, to buy, and to then
influence our friends/peers.

Remember, I don't claim to be an expert, I just look for technical
correctness :-)  I represent a collection (association) of retail /
service businesses involved in the oil & filter changing arena, and I try
to get the correct technical information for them, so they in turn train
and perform to the highest levels of integrity and professionalism. 
Hopefully, as a side benefit, when applicable, I can pass along that
integrity to you all also.

multiviscosity properties so there is nothing to break down..."

That's a very interesting statement Bernie.  In my position as Director
of Education at the Automotive Oil Change Association, I am always
interested in technical correctness (not to be confused with political
correctness  : -) .  Your statement creates a type of dare for me, that
is to find out if what you state is true.

As you can imagine, all of the oil companies belong to my association, as
vendors / suppliers, because they serve the end users who are my
dues-paying regular members.

For those reasons, I am very careful when I make statements about items
like this that are in my purview, and I try ever so hard not to make a
mis-statement.

Putting in calls to the technical gurus I know, I find out that that
statement is NOT true for any of the synthetic oils (with Mobil as a
possible one exception), and Mobil is very cagey about making any
statement.  The only thing the majority use to create multi-vis
properties is VII's.  The Mobil reps I talked to refused to admit that
there were "NO" VIIs in the recipe for Mobil 1's different blends, and I
was referred to some obscure guru who I was not allowed to talk to, and I
must communicate by written letter only, in Fairfax, VA.  Speaking with
several of my members who are distributors of this product, they in turn
speaking with their regional reps, I am told that they all believe that
there is indeed a quantity of VII in any of their products.

So, the quest continues.  Before I would go so far as to say that there
is NO VII in a Mobil 1 synthetic product, I'd be real careful.  If I get
anywhere with Mr. Obscure, I'll post to all, as I did this time.

Your partial statement about breakdown is correct in that it is the
additives that break down.  The oil never breaks down.  Just a point of
clarity, and I wanted to point out your correctness.  To reinforce; it is
always, and always will be, oil (chemical composition speaking).  It may
have other contamination added, may be baked/oxidized and solid, may be
thinned with some fuels, but the oil is still oil, and it doesn't break
down and become something else as in an alternate form of compost, and it
doesn't turn into a  tree, or a diamond, by magic.

Sorry about the length of some of the responses, but in the interest of
technical correctness, we try to make the full statement.  Partial
statements tend to get us in trouble.  Some of the other technical
statements are more easily handled with brevity, and I try to be brief
when I can.
