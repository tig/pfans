When I was driving to Perioa the other day to visit Brad Mayeur's shop
and get the longitudinal frame repair sections discussed recently on the
list, I ran into a problem on the way home with the car cutting out. I
boneheaded my way to the repair(took three hours to find a bad ground
connection to the fuel pump), and in so doing I did something that has
marginalized the engine idle behavior. Before, it had an almost always
steady idle of 900 to 1,000 RPMs. At the end of the trip, it wouldn't
idle hardly at all, but after readjusting the dwell ( I put new points
in during the bonehead play) Now it idles at barely 5oo or so when
slightly warmed up. I have tried the idle air screw on the butterfly
body of the injection, and have it set to the best spot(highest without
dying) and have diddled the mixture control on the brain, (lost the
original value, and don't have a CO meter)What's the right approach to
coordinating these two adjustments? Haynes doesn't talk about it. Must
the brain adjust be done with a CO meter? Does this adjustment lag, or
have an immediate effect? What's the starting point for the air bleed
(all the way closed then out 1 and 1/2 turns) or what? Just trying to
idle away the summer. PS the reinforcements came out great, and the new
outer rocker panels look great. It's nice to have new jack points, even
if the scissors jack is still the better way to lift the car.
