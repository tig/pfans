Greetings, 914-er's!

Please find enclosed a reply from Carole Migden, chair of the CA.
assembly appropriations committee to my E-mail to her re SB 42.   I
have written... have you?

 (Apologies for use of bandwidth to those of you on this list who do
not live in CA.) 

Reproduction follows:

Dear Mr. Thorusen,

Thank you for your letter to let me know about your position in
support
of Senate Bill 42 regarding classic cars and emission regulations. 
The
bill was recently the subject of a hearing before the Assembly
Committee
on Appropriations on July 16, and will be voted on by the committee
in
late August.  Contrary to some postings I have read, I have not taken
a
position in opposition to the bill, nor is the bill dead.  The bill,
along with hundreds of other legislative proposals, is continuing
through
the legislative process.  I am continuing to study many aspects of
the
Smog Check 2 program quite extensively, including the proposal
included
within Senate Bill 42.  I certainly appreciate hearing your insights
on
the need for the SB 42, as I will review your note (along with many
others I've received) before next month's vote.

Sincerely,

Assemblywoman Carole Migden
