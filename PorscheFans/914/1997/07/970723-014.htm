Just yesterday I registered my "new" '76 914 here in Calif.  Sales tax
and a 
year's license totalled $190.

Blue book on a '76 (2.0 only)
     low  $2250         high $4200
ctr cons    100		       135

I am asking the woman's ins co for $4750 for my blue one, as it was in
prime 
condition.  She was cutting the corner on a blind curve and collided
head-on 
with my son.  Both have minor injuries.  Fortunately, he remembered the 
disposable camera in the glovebox and took lots of pictures for proof. 
The CHP arrived two hours later and reported that she should be
prosecuted
for driving on the wrong side of the road, which had no centerline.

A disposable camera is more important to carry than a spare tire.

Cheers,
