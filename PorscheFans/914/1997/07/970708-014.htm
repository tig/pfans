Hi guys, first i'd like to thank everyone who offered buying advice on the
$4000 914 I was looking at. Thanks to all the advice you guys proved right...
not to buy it.
Here's my question, "Does the decent $2500 914 exist?" I'm not even talking
about a 73-74 2litre. I've been searching across Louisiana and some of
Florida /Alabama looking for a decent sometime driver 3rd car in that price
range and can't find one. Every person who has a 914 thinks they're made of
gold and the last one. I have a 72 I could reassemble, bought it in boxes,
but don't have the time with new son and new business so I'm looking for one
that runs and drives. What do you guys think... Imean I've even seen 4cyl
cars going for more than 6cyl cars. And by the way, many people are asking
CPI book proces for 914's... It frustrates me because if those prices were
real my 944 Turbo would be worth close to 20grand not the 7500 I'll probably
get for it.

Thanks for letting me vent... please send in your opinions on this.

Ben

P.S. I've never recovered all the money I've put into a car has anyone? The
reason I ask is some ads recently say "$5000 in new parts and I'm only asking
$1 an hour for my labor." My experience I get nothing for labor and lose my
ass on parts.
