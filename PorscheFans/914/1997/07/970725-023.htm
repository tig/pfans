I think that ther first and most usual thing to look for is rust. Since
you're at Cal Poly, there's a good chance that you will be looking at a
relatively rust free example, but my experience tells me that they all
have some. The battery tray is the most notorious, due to leaking
battery juice causing rust of the tray and suspension console when the
rain comes in through the engine compartment lid. Other rust prone
areas, well, what areas do you have? The longitudinals (inner rockers):
loosen the screws securing the lower edge of the outer rockers (liable
to be rusted in) and check the jacking points and along the length of
the inner rockers. Probe with an awl or small screwdriver for thin
spots, if the rust spots are not gaping holes. You may encounter rust
repairs in this area, a piece of metal overlayed over the inner rocker
and welded in. Check at the back of the front wheel wells. On the inside
of the passenger caompartment, lift out the center carpet section, and
then pick up the lower edge of the outer side piece of carpet and
examine the inner area of the longitudinal, probing here as well. Other
places are at the extreme front corners of the engine compartment,
especially if the drain holes are plugged. Check under the headlight
buckets as well.
    All the usual mechanical checks should be made, compression, oils
leaks, condition of the exhaust system and shocks. All of these things
can cost surprisingly high amounts of money becasue of the Porsche name
and the old rule of supply and demand. Does it have the original Fuel
Injection? If its carb'ed it will have trouble passing smog, and could
cost big bucks to restore the FI. Look at the condition ofg the fuel
lines, as many of these leak, or deteriorate, and require proper
selection of high pressure metric line.  The Riveria wheels are
originally  VW fittings, and the offset limits your tire size to 195-60
15, and likely to be tight on one side or the other at that. Check the
action of the Transmission and shift linkage. It's not unusual to have
weak 1st gear synchros. Interior parts canb also be tough, with things
like sun visors tagged at stunning values, unless you're adept at
searching out good deals. I am sure that you'll hear about all of the
things that I overlooked.

                                                                  Been
all over there
                                                                  Done
most of that.
