I hope some of you can find the time to join this gathering of fellow 914ers.
 The Table Rock Lake area is part of the Diamond Lakes region and is a
wonderful recreation lake.  From fishing, swimming, jet-skiing, sailing
aboard the Lodges catamaran (capable of holding 40 people) to Silver Dollar
City or the famous Branson night life, this area can provide something for
everyone.
Feel free to call if you have questions.  

Happy trails.......Rich
