I have no direct experience, but I can tell you what I've learned.
Basically, 103mm P&C's are a bad idea for the street for several reasons.
These include the fact that it is difficult/impossible to increase the
cooling capacity of the engine, if you install larger valves to match the
larger pistons, the head will crack, and others that I can't think of right now.

Doing this is just too expensive and unreliable to be worth the trouble, in
my opinion. You have to use carbs, for example, which rules out registering
the car in many states. Most people seem to just go for the 6 conversion if
they want more power and have the money to do it.
