Glad it helped.  Sending this to the list also in case anyone else needs
the info.

The unit that Bob Hoover mentioned is probably the least expensive one I've
heard of after the Pertronix/Compufire  point replacement units.   I recall
seeing a message where someone asked about building their own, I think by
the time they totaled up the large heat sink, power transistors, special
transformer, they were getting close to the cost of a built one.   Just
went web surfing, here is the info from the Hoover site:

>I (and a few others on the vintagvw mailing list) are interested in
>building our a CDI system for use on our bugs. I was wondering if it would
>be possible for you to describe how to build a CDI system suitable for a
VW
bug.

Joe,

It would cost less to buy one from Universal Corp. Their address & phone
number is in one of the 'sermons'. Present cost
of the units I use is about $90. The problem with building a unit yourself
is availability of a proper transformer and heat-sink.
By the time you've worked up a suitable circuit board, tracked down a
transformer and figured out how to keep the
switching transistors cool, you will have invested far more than the cost
of a purchased unit.

Heathkit, Radio Shack and others sold the identical module in both kit and
assembled form. Common brand names were
Delta and Archer. All used the same circuit and components, the most
critical of which was the special transformer used in
the inverter.

If you can obtain a back issue of "Nuts & Volts" magazine for February,
1995, you'll find a schematic and parts list for the
Delta Mark 10 CDI module on page 43.

Here is the address for the place that makes the unit.  I think the part
numbers for the VW use were  (Part number 73XX4959N,
or its waterproof cousin 73XX7080X)

Building your own would be an interesting project though.

Hi Jeff!

  Your info was most complete and helpful.  Thank you very much for
your efforts.  I think that the Jacobs system is out of my price
range at the moment, and I would prefer something that used the
original coil as well.   I will have to dig out my circuits manual
and see if anyone has a generic do-it-yourself circuit for a
points-controlled electronic ignition.  If so, I might just try
building one.  Anyway, thanks a bunch for the info.

     Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
