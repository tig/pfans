Thanx for the advice on the VDO. I've got it hooked up now as you
described. I went back to Bow Wow to look at the new kit and re read the
instructions. Now, it still doen't work ! It seems pretty obvious now
that the gauge itself if kindo screwed up. It does not return to 0 if it
it not hooked up, just hovers at 300 all the time. The needle will move
if I shake it, though. The new guage had two connections (+ and ground).
My "old" gauge, which is virtually identical in face, size and housing,
has three connections (+ and ground and "S"). Have you seen this style?
The ground connection is a spade connected to the screw in the center
between "S" and +. 
I am also wondering how the sender can attach to a bolt or spark plug and
not be grounding out? Wouln't this change the resistance, or is that part
of the calibration built in. 
Another thought--is there a way to open this housing, add a new resistor
and fix the thing? Anyone ever look inside of one of these?
I am trying to locate a source for buying just the gauge. All the people
I talked to only sell the kit. Are you listening, Doc?
