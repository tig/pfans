OK, fellow ninefourteeners, I was crawling around the disemboweled rear 
half of my car when I noticed that there was no seam seal on the welded 
joints that hold the suspension console and other parts together. Since 
these are directly under the open rear seam of the engine lid when it's 
closed, the get rain on them. Whereas in the upper corners of the engine 
bay where the firewall meets the side panels, there is plenty of seam 
seal, but no rain would ever get there. It's no wonder our cars rust 
away, what with rain getting into the interior portions of the body! Not 
only that, but there's a U shaped crossmember spot welded to the trunk 
bulkhead at the rear of the engine bay that not only has a couple of 
holes init, but since the trunk bulkhead is corrugated, the U shaped 
member only seals at the flat portions of the bulkhead. This aear is also 
exposed to rain. So, where does the rain go when it gets into this 
crossmember? it dribbles down inside the sheetmetal and comes out at a 
weep hole next to the suspension console! How do I know this? I squirted 
a bunch of Eastwood's cavity wax in to the holes of the crossmember and 
waited. A little while later, wax was coming out by the console. Like I 
said, why in the world would someone design water channels on purpose 
inside body panels? I can undersatnd the need to handle condensation 
ventilation, but this is rediculous! Also, if you run your finger up the 
long seam that runs on top of the inner fender inside the engine bay, 
you'll find at the top very near the trunk bulkhead (the rear of the 
engine bay) a couple of holes (or buckles) in the seam. I checked to make 
sure these were actual holes in the seam by inserting a long thin object 
inthere. These holes are close enough to the rear of the engine lid 
opening to get rained on. So, why did they figure the insides of the body 
panels needed occasional flushing from rain? (I'm not seriously asking 
that question)

So, I got out my version of seam seal and sealed up just about every seam 
I could find in the engine bay. I left the weep hole, however. I don't 
know what to do about that crossmember.

Oh yeah, tell my why they decided to not top coat the upper part of the 
trunk bulkhead. It only had white primer on it and overspray from the 
rest of the paint job. Is this a feature??

Karmin - house of rust!
