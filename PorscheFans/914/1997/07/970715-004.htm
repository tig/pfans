I'm feeling a little foolish right now, but I've got to ask anyway.
When I bought my car, I knew 100 times less about 914s than I do now,
and I still don't know a whole lot.  The PO was telling me about all of
the things that he had done to the car, but I was still too giddy from
the test drive to pay attention.  I just nodded and handed the man a
check so I could drive my new car home.  Now that I've calmed down a
bit, I'm curious about the modifications that have been done, but can't
get a hold of the PO.  I know the car has been lowered, but I'm not sure
how much, and I'm pretty sure that it's got front and rear sway bars,
but I don't know how big they are.  I'm positive that the springs are
stiffer, but I don't know how much.  I don't know if the torsion bars
are bigger, but it feels like it.  I remember him telling me that
something on the car was made by Weltmeister, and I'm guessing its one
or both of the sway bars, but again, I'm not sure.  I really don't know
anything about suspensions, so I can't even be certain that what I'm
looking at under the car is a sway bar.  Is there a difference between a
sway bar and an anti-roll bar?  Any advice on how would I go about
checking this stuff out?  Do I need any special measuring equipment
(calipers, etc)?

Thanks again,
