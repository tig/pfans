Very nice ... I'm definitely impressed!

For anyone looking to buy on a rather smaller budget, I have dropped the
price on my '74 914 2.0L (well, 2.1L if you count the big bore pistons)
to US$3500, given that my A4 is due to arrive very soon now.  A similar
idea to Craig's car, but obviously not taken nearly as far -- but,
still, it's a very clean, rust-free 914 2.0L.

For details:	http://www.metrics.com/staff/tomh/914.html

It's up in Canada, near Toronto, but if you're not too far away ...
