The 1.7 and 1.8 were consolidated with the 2.0 for the '95 or '96
season, and then the lot of 'em were moved up into the newly
restructured B/S for '97 along with the miatas. SCCA is currently under
a BoB method of classing. That is "Best Of Breed". I argued a bit over
this but finally just decided it wasn't worth it to waste my breath on
the SCAC anymore. As for Street Prepared? The catch all definitions of
the classes prevents 914s from moving down into D/SP, but that battle
I've just started, and I vow to emerge vicorious some day!
