For Sam M. and any other interested parties:

Sam asks:

  I towed my 914 about 90 miles with a tow dolly to get it home after
I bought it. No problems with the 914.  I don't see why it wouldn't
go as far as you want, just be sure that the rear wheel bearings, CV
joints, and rear tires are in good shape.
  Since the gearbox will be spinning, make sure that it has adequate
oil in it.

  Then again,  if you can make it fit, you can always lash the
steering wheel and put the rear end on the tow dolly, and tow it
backwards.

 Anyone on else on the list have experience?
