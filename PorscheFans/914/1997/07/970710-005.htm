Hi Im new to the list...

Im looking to buy a 914 pretty soon.  Ive got a couple questions though.

1.	Im going to autocross the car (competitively) in SCCA Solo2.  What is
the best car for this?  I was first told that a 70 is best because its so
much lighter.  Others told me the 2.0 was the car to have.  As far as a
914/6 goes, I dont have that kind of money so Im sticking with either a 1.7
or 2.0.

2.	What years were the 2.0s built?  Ive found several here in SoCal and
they range in year from 71-76.  71 seemed kind of early to me...

3.	What prices are fair for a 914 2.0 and 1.7 in daily driver condition?

Thanks for all the help...
