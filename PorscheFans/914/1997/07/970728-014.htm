Probably a wise move. Don't count it out, but give it thought, it's a
relative unknown (aren't thery all?).

This is either a very good sign, or a warning. Good: He is a 914
enthusiast and wants the car to find a good home. He's probably done
considerable upkeep on the car and it's probably equiped with some
updates as well. Bad: He just buys junker 914s and fixes 'em up so he
can resell them. The engine is actually a cheap knock-off bus motor and
will possibly even be carbed. The paint job may just be a spray over to
hide the rust and bondo. I'm not saying either one of these is true,
just looking at extreems. 

What makes you say this fellow is "Posche Person"? Did you see his other
cars? Does he race? And most importantly, where is the engine being
built? If the car is clean, minimal rust, and brand-new well-built 2.0
with FI, then I guess there's only one thing to do. RUN! RUN! Don't
walk, to your nearest bank and have a check drawn for $4k and BUY IT!

If he _is_ a racer, mention that to him. But if the car really is that
clean and has a brand new motor with FI in it, $4k is a deal and a half.
Mention it to him, but don't balk at $4k. I was lucky to get mine for
$3,300 and it still needed a good deal of work to get set up to my
satisfaction. But find out who did the motor and what's been done to it.
If the motor has been modified it may not be the thing you want if
you're buying the car for competition. For the main reason that some of
the mods may bump your car into a very highly prepared category.
