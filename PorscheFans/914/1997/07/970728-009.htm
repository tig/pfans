After looking at a Silver/gray (depending on your point of view) 73 2.0
this past Saturday I really truly know that I want a 914.  It was a real
2.0 with no rust (except for the battery tray and even then only surface),
and no dents.  It seemed to have an oil leak from an undetermined spot and
an aftermarket exhaust.  It also had Rivierras and not the original alloys.
 His asking price was 3900 bucks... which seemed a little steep so I walked
away to think about it.

Now Im going to look at another 1973 2.0L.  This car is blue (painted
2years ago) and rust free (again except for the battery tray).  It has the
correct alloys, and is completely stock.  As of now there is not an engine
in it but the new 2.0 is being picked up today to be dropped in.  The owner
is a Porsche person who is selling this car because he has too many 914s
(Is that possible?).  His asking price is $4000.

Now my dilemma:  I felt that the person with the silver car was asking too
much at $3900.  This car with a new engine has an asking price of $4000. 
Assuming the car is in better condition that the silver one, should I even
bother bargaining on price?  I dont want to insult the man, but a couple
hundred off would go a long ways towards some R1s.

Any advice is again appreciated.
