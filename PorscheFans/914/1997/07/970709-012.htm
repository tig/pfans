Jeff,

Check and see if either of them also includes the solenoid for using
gas.  Figure another $100 if it doesn't....  The fully adjustable
controls are nice; I have those on my SP125+, and it makes life much
easier for a novice like me.  Also consider which one the local welding
shops sell; it's real nice to get the little parts locally when/if
you need them.

Mike
