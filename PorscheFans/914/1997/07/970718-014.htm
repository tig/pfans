Greetings, 914-er's!

  Murphy is alive and well!  I just got a new HP pentium machine, and =
have been setting up the E-mail, so when the PorscheFans list went dark =
at the same time, I just naturally assumed that I still didn't have =
everything set up right.  Then, I just now got around to looking at the =
archives, and discovered that there were some messages there after all!  =


  I just un-subscribed, and re-subscribed, and the confirming messages =
stated that my un-subscription didn't work, because I was not a member =
of the list.  The new subscription took, however, and I hope to once =
again receive mail.

  I read Josh Hadler's comment about the list dumping everyone, and it =
looks as though he was correct.

  I find it amazing that everytime I make a hardware or software change, =
the list seems to hiccup at about the same time, so I always miss a week =
or more of mail before I figure out that it isn't me.  As I said, =
Murphey is alive and well!
