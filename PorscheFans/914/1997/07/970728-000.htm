The only thing that I can think of is that the differential may be starved
of oil if the car is towed by the front with the front tilted in the air. I
haven't seen a tow dolly in a while, so I can't say for sure if it would be
problem. Anyway, the tow truck companies around here tow by the driven
wheels (tow backwards for rear wheel drive cars, front wards for front wheel
drive cars). In other words, the driven wheels are off the ground in both cases.
