Mike,

The Lincoln is the weld pac 100 model.

It's the Century that has the fully adjustable volt and speed settings.
Since both units about the same price that is the tradeoff I'm considering.
The Lincoln is a well known brand and tips etc available from Home Depot.
The Century has the preferable fully adjustable features but is a lessor
known quantity.  Got some replies that the Century uses parts for Tweco
which can be found at most supply houses so will check that out.

Pretty sure I'm going to go with the Century to get the fully adjustable
controls.

Also, I tried replying directly to you but the messages get bounced saying
"Host connect failed - destination does not respond correctly"   Seems like
I've tried to copy you on other emails and gotten that.  I've asked our IS
guys, you might want to check with you service provider.

Jeff

What you just said implies that you are looking at a Weld-Pak100.  Is
that right?  If so, it doesn't have fully adjustable voltage settings...
