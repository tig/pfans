Guys,

Thanks for the tips and pics about the tensioners and door handles.
Jim's suggestion and Dave's pic made me pause for a moment.  I went to
my bookcase and grabbed my 911 handbook.  Lo and behold, there were
pic's of all the different tensioners in there.  Now, assuming the 
PO didn't simply change covers, it looks like I have the Carrera tensioners
And some further icing on the cake is that it looks like the motor has
the updated 930 valve covers as well.  Yee-haw.

On a less joyous note though, I still have not managed to get the farging
door handles out of the doors.  Spinning the nut with an electric drill
for about 10 minutes didn't seem to faze anything; they don't build 'em
like they used to....  I'm going to break out the trusty Dremel sometime
this week and see what havoc I can wreak with that....

Mike
