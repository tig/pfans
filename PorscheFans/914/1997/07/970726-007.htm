Greetings, 914-er's!

  Just thought I'd share an electrical trouble-shooting experience
with the list.  

  I  had a problem with my '74 914 2.0 litre ever since I got it back
together and running:  If the turn signal lever was deflected to
either the  left  or the right with the ignition off, there was power
applied to both the turn signal lamps and the side marker lights on
the affected side.  No flashing, and no green arrows in the tach,
just lights on about half brilliance (I suspect they were in series
somehow).

  Since the automatic cancellation feature on the turn signal switch
has gone the way of the dinosaur, it was very easy to pull into the
driveway, get out of the car with the turn signal lever still
operated from the last turn, and find out the next day that the
battery was nearly flat.  A very frustrating experience.

  I spent several hours poking around today, and finally fixed the
problem.  I didn't do a thorough analysis on it to figure out exactly
what was happening, but I do have a fix if anyone out there has
similar dificulties.

  Briefly, there is a gray wire that comes off the back of the
ignition switch that provides the +12 volts to the turn signal switch
when the ignition is off.  I'm not sure exactly what this wire did
originally, but I'm guessing that it had to do with the
key-in-the-ignition anti-theft buzzer.   At any rate, all that
garbage was de-activated by the previous owner, which is fine with
me, but somehow, a sneak circuit got left that enabled the
turn-signal problem.

  The fix?  I pulled the terminal for the gray wire out of the
ignition switch connector body, taped it up, and tucked it away with
the rest of the wiring harness.  Now, I can leave the turn signal
lever in any position I desire, and with the ignition off, there's no
drain.

  Now all I need to do is find a replacement turn-signal switch
assembly with working auto-cancel.  Anyone on the list have one for
sale?

					Regards,
                                                            Jim T.
