Hello Steve, 

 I believe I gave you his number before, but try           Scott Sanford
at Auto Tech (909) 981-5843. He had dont a a lot of conversions and I've
seen his front bumpers and they are really nice. He will be doing my
sooner or later. He also has a good chrome guy and there both local for
you.

Later, 
 Don




Hello PorscheFans!

   Well, my 914/6 conversion is wrapping up and I'll be putting the
finishing
touches on in a couple weeks. Have a couple front bumper/oil cooler
questions
for everyone out there:
   Has anyone modified their front bumper for the GT look that has the
cut out
for the oil cooler air flow? I'm not refering to the 916 bumper, but the
style
that has a notch in the bottom of the bumper and another notch in the
top of the
valence just to let air into the front mounted cooler.
   How much does it cost to chrome the front 914 bumper? Rear? Any
recommendations
of where to send it?

Thanks in advance,
Steve Iverson
914 3.6 (almost)
