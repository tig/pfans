The following is an update on SB 42 in California.  If you are a
California resident, I urge you to call the Assembly Appropriations
office and voice your support.

                                   MEMORANDUM
        
        From:          Senator Quentin L. Kopp
        
        To:              Supporters of SB 42
        
        Subject:      Assembly Appropriations Committee hearing on 
                                July 16, 1997
        
        
        
        Your continued expressions of support for SB 42 to me and 
        Members of the Assembly are greatly appreciated.  Your letters 
        and calls have been crucial in moving the bill through the 
        legislative process.  In addition, many of you were gracious 
        enough to attend the hearing of the Assembly Transportation 
        Committee on the bill and show your strong support.  Your 
        support helped secure passage of the bill by the Transportation 
        Committee on a 17-0 vote.
        
        SB 42 is now scheduled to be heard by the Assembly 
        Appropriations Committee on Wednesday July 16, 1997.  The 
        hearing will commence at 9:30 a.m. in Room 4202 in the State 
        Capitol, Sacramento.  
        
        I would like to invite and strongly encourage your attendance at 
        the Appropriations Committee hearing on July 16th to further 
        evidence your support for the enactment of SB 42.   Such support 
        will be needed to overcome the objections of the Air Resources 
        Board and Bureau of Automotive Repair to the bill's passage.  If 
        you cannot attend, I invite you to call the Appropriations 
        Committee at (916)  322-4323 to express your support of the 
        bill.
        
        Thank you again for your considerable efforts to secure passage 
        of SB 42.
