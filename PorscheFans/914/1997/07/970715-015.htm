>> you're either not putting tires on a stock 914 <<

Your right, Dave, I'm not putting them on a 914 at all. But the question =
of
perceived differences between the two tires is what I was interested in. =
As
a matter of fact, I went back to the Tirerack web site after your e-mail
and realized that I wasn't even comparing the same size tires. The
differential in the size I was looking at, 225/50 16, was only about $65.=
 I
usually get them mounted and balanced at the tire place by Carrera Tech,
oops, CT Engineering in Campbell. They don't do well with painted wheels,=

but the stock 911 fuchs they handle fine. Chipped the paint on my white R=
S
wheels. Any way, yours is the only response I've seen so far, and I
appreciate it. No digests the last couple of days, maybe they are having
trouble with the list again. =
