I think my parking brake cable is corroded enough that it doesn't
release after being used.  I don't use it.  But the other day a friend
pulled it.  At the ensuing autox I found that once the pads/rotors
heated up and I was rolling up to the starting line I would get a bit of
resonance/howl from the brakes (rears, I think).  I asked a couple 914
guys there what they thought and they said it was normal, and that once
things cooled down they wouldn't drag.  I understand that the pads are
supposed to touch (I think) the rotor, but should it make enough contact
to howl?  Or is my parking brake not releasing properly?  I took vice
grips and tried to pull the p-brake cables back, but no change.  Don't
hear the resonance howl all the time, just when things warm up.

Thanks.  Thwen.
