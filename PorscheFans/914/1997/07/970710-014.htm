Greetings, 914-er's!

  I find that I must respectfully disagree with Jerry Brady's description of the VDO 
CHT gauge technology.

  This is simply not correct, at least, not with my VDO gauge.  The sensor is a 
bi-metallic junction, NOT a thermistor.   The difference is, a thermistor is a resistor 
that changes it's resistance with temperature.  To use such a device to operate a 
temperature gauge, an external source of regulated DC voltage is required.  This 
voltage source is connected to one side of the meter movement in the gauge, and 
the other side of the gauge then returns to ground through the thermistor which is 
attached to the engine, a suitable ground.  The varying resistance of the thermistor 
controls the current through the meter movement (gauge) which then deflects 
according to the applied current.   This system requires that vehicle power be 
supplied to the gauge, which must contain a voltage regulator chip internally to 
prevent changes in the car's electrical system voltage from showing up as 
changes in engine temperature.   Only a single wire is needed to connect to the 
sensor, but the internal regulator in the gauge housing requires both switched +12 
volts and ground for proper operation.  This is exactly the scheme used with the 
VDO oil pressure gauge, except that it has a PRESSURE dependent resistor 
instead of a TEMPERATURE dependent resistor.

  The VDO CHT gauge, however, operates on a different principle.  The sensor 
contains a bi-metallic junction.  This junction is the equivalent of the "thermocouple" 
that is found in the common gas water heater.   In the case of the water heater, the 
junction is positioned in the pilot flame, and the electrical current that it generates is 
used to hold open a solenoid operated valve in the main gas line.  Should the pilot 
light go out, the junction cools off, no current is generated, and the solenoid valve 
closes, preventing natural gas from being dumped into the house.
   The VDO sensor operates on exactly the same principle;  it is a VOLTAGE 
SOURCE, not a temperature dependent resistor.  It therefore requires two wires to 
form a complete circuit to the gauge, and these wires are crimped into the ring 
terminal of the sensor in such a way that that they are normally coupled only 
thermally, NOT electrically, to the cylinder head.   In a normally operating VDO 
system, the CHT can be read with the ignition off, and all vehicle power removed 
from the gauge... at least mine can.   This would be impossible with a thermistor 
type system, because the thermistor can only control the flow of an externally 
supplied current; not generate it's own.

  There should be, as I said, TWO wires, not just one.  There may be continuity 
between one of these wires and ground, but you should get some extremely 
strange readings if you go across both wires.  Most ohmmeters don't like to be 
connected to voltage sources; if you do, the reading will be meaningless.
  A better check would be to use a good low range (millivolt) meter and look for 
voltage that is proportional to the temperature of the sensor.   This voltage should 
be measured across the two wires comming from the sensor, and NOT with 
respect to ground.

   I hope that this clears things up

                                        Regards,
                                        Jim T.
