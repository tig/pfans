I'd suspect a leak somewhere upstream of the calipers. Possibly the hard
lines connecting to the master. Seeing as how you claim to see this much
air in all four caliper lines, suspect whatever they all have in common.
I suspect either the hard lines, the soft lines to/from the resevior, or
the master itself. What else would there be? If it's just the rear, then
maybe the proportioning valve is a possible culprit.

But before you tear apart your braking system. It might behove you to
re-eximne your bleeding technique. No flame or insult intended, but if
you're finding that much air in you lines, it's possible you're letting
air back into to lines between pedal pumps.

I used LMA for a while until I started running with race pads. Boiled
the fluid in 20 minutes of spirited driving in the hills (NO BRAKES!
Definate shorts check there). 914s are notorious for hot brakes, and at
the time, brake ducts were still not legal in my class (they are now),
so I did all I could to prevent boiled brake fluid. If you're looking
for a high-temp brake fluid, Ford heavy duty brake fluid is a cheap way
to go. It's the high temp castrol stuff repackaged for ford truck use,
and it's alot cheaper than the actual castrol SRF fluid.

Well, my pedal _still_ is not as firm as _I'd_ like it to be. But it's
pretty good. And I'm running the 19mm master, SS lines, and Porterfield
pads. The pads help firm up the pedal because they're so damn thick,
reducing piston travel. They _barely_ fit into the caliper. As for
looking at your car? I live in Colorado, Dave D. is in California, and
Mike I believe lives furhter up north. So where might we find this
critter? 

BTW, I plan to be in Portland, OR mid august, any P-fans there want to
get together for a beer or somethin'?

It's a possibility, but look for leaking fluid. You're pulling in air
from somewhere. And I doubt you're driving the car hard enough to boil
that much fluid. UNLESS, your calipers are dragging and hence heating up
incredibly.

The car is just testing you. "Do you _really_ like me?".

Anytime...
