>2.	What years were the 2.0s built?

	As Dirk mentioned, check the FAQ.  There's other info about what
kind of equipment came with which year cars.

>3.	What prices are fair for a 914 2.0 and 1.7 in daily driver condition?

	When I was last looking, several years ago in the Bay Area, the
"driver" 2.0s were going for up to $5K.  I know some people who walked into
absolutely killer deals (one guy got a 73 2.0 with a dead clutch for $2750),
and some people who paid $7K + for the "right" car.
	The early 1.7s were going for up to $2K-$2500.  The 72-3 ones were
a bit higher, maybe up to $3K+.
	However, you'll always have people who think they've got the "best"
914 that is worth *much* more than that, and you'll always have some people
who don't know what they've got.

	Current SoCal market prices may be different.  Check the local Auto
Trader rags, newspapers, etc.  Make sure to have the car checked out by a
competent mechanic who is familiar with 914s!
	Or, you could go to Otto's and pay top dollar for a completed resto
project.  I think one listmember got a 74 2.0 with fresh rebuilds on the
engine and tranny for about $7K.  If you go early 1.7, it might be a couple
thou less.

	Good luck!
