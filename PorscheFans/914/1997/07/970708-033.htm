There is, but how brave are you? When my MPS diaphram went south, I
ordered a rebuilt unit from Automotion. I didn't like the fact that they
rebuilt it with the vent holes on the top rather than the bottom (sort
of defeats the purpose) so I rebuuilt my old one with parts from the
rebuilt unit. 
Here's what I found. For a rebuild, they replace the four case-half
rivets with 6 mm (I think) screws and nuts, so you ONLY! need to drill
out the rivets to separate the MPS case halves. When you do, you will
have the pre-tension adjuster in the top half and the diaphram and the
coil and wiring connections in the other half. (Or maybe the diaphram
was in the top, I don't remember, anyway, it wasn't like taking apart a
computer or a pocket watch.) There was an O-ring to seal the two halves,
but maybe only in the rebuilt unit. No dangers in disassembly/reassembly
if you draw pictures first and observe the relative position of the case
halves, but it takes a big emotional leap to drill out those rivets.
