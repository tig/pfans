Greetings, 914-er's!

  The following inserts are courtesy of Senator Quentin Kopp's
office.  They give the status of SB 42 (rolling smog exemption for 25
year-old + cars). This legislation is well worth supporting, and
although it has sailed through all previous committees, the
money-grubbing appropriations committee is trying to kill it.  The
details follow, as well as how to contact the appropriations
committee members.  Let's hold their feet to the fire on this one.

        SB 42 had no NO votes in the Assembly Transportation
Committee.  
        The vote was 17-0.  The Assembly Appropriations Committee
vote 
        on the motion to pass the bill and not place it on suspense
8-8.
        Voting to by-pass Suspense were:
        	
        Assm. Poochigian, Ackerman, Aguiar, Bordonaro, Brewer,
Granlund, 
        Olberg and Thompson.
        
        Voting to keep hold the bill in Suspense until August:
        	Migden, Baca, Kuehl, Martinez, Perata, Sweeney, 
        Villarigosa and Washington.
        
        11 votes would have been required to pass the bill.  Not
voting 
        were:  Cardenas, Machado, Papan, Shelley and Thomson	
        
        
        Thanks for your continued support of SB 42.

PorscheFans lists without starting another dreaded mail bounce?
