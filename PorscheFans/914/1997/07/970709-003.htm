I guess what I was trying to say was that buying new and restoring old are
both losing propositions financially, but that restoring old was possibly
less of a losing proposition. I figure that since you have to have wheels,
then it's better to restore an old car than to buy a new one from a
financial perspective. The cars I've bought are still worth pretty much what
I paid for them, which no one can say about any new car. Those poor 928 guys
have really taken a bath with the plumeting prices on thier cars, for example.
