Hi, I have been running a J-stock racer for the past 4 years (914-2.0 
Stock) and I can tell you it is fun and frustrating at the same time. I am 
in the east and there are people here with money, and J is an easy target. 
The 914-2.0 runs against 68-69 -911's and 924 (not S). The 911's should 
beat you hands down, and the 924 is faster on the long straight, but you 
can beat them in the corners so it is a fun class.

Most of the cars out here are well prepared, and you should plan on 
spending $1k per race on the whole deal, more if you screw up.

The next class up is I and you don't have a chance there. (911's. 914/6, 
etc.) The winner should be a well prepared lightweight 911, and there will 
be lots of them.

To keep the car in J you will need to keep the Fuel Injection on it, make 
no changes to motor other than balancing it and making sure the heads are 
in good shape. (You can make no changes other than lighting for balancing 
from intake to exsaust ports. The tires will need to be 205 x 60 - 15's. 
The weight must be over 2139# and you must have all the interior that is 
not required to be removed for the roll cage/bar.

I recommend the auto-power cage from O-G racing, it must be a bolt in type, 
and it weights about what the spare tire, jack and sound suppression on 
fire wall combined come in at. Given the cost difference between a crossed 
braced roll bar and a cage I will take the cage and walk away from what 
ever I hit.

I drive my car to the track and back, so it is street legal but has no 
heat. I have yet to win a race but have lots of  seconds and thirds. (BTW: 
second is first loser)

Get the rule book and stick to it !  Many people "cheat" (oh my mechanic 
must have done that!) and though they win sometimes, I view them as losers. 

All in All the class is fun and the compitors are good. Come on in the 
tracks fine.

bolt-in cage	$800 installed  (used never!)
battery cut-off	$75 with the cables
window net	$75 (net is 20 mount will add 50)
brake pads	figure on a set of fronts every race weekend at $90 rears every 
third
R1s		$500 - have 205/60R15  (That the tire)  (205/50 are not stock)
Springs		$100
T-bars		$100
Shocks		$200
Harnesses	You need to have a nice new set (3 year life) and it is cheap 
insurance See Summit racing should come in under $120. The eye bolts just 
mount through the body to plates or real big washers. Keep you 911 harness 
in it.

Extinguisher	have
OMP race seat	already have

	Add in an oil cooler and lines
	Good 3 layer driving suite ( see O-G again)
	Nice full face snell 95 helmet
	Gloves & shoes

	Figure $3 to 5k to get to 1st race and $1k per and its is worth it all the 
way.

Subject:	914-2.0 Club racer

Hi 914-Pfans,

I've done my share of Driver's Ed and am considering the purchase of a
'74 914-2.0 for PCA Club Racing.   I need to budget  initial car prep
with myself
doing all the labor.   This will be a stock or improved class car which 
will
not be competitive but I don't care once I'm actually racing and having 
fun.

So far I've thought of the following other than $3k purchase price,
assuming a relatively rust-free car w/o engine work needed:

bolt-in cage	$500?  used?
battery cut-off	?
window net	?
brake pads	$200
R1s		$500 - have 205/60R15 but 205/50 still stock?
Springs		$100
T-bars		$100
Shocks		$200
Harnesses	already have - can long 911 harness be dual-use
		for both cars?  i.e. some way of attaching to cage?
Extinguisher	have
OMP race seat	already have

Are the prices realistic assuming sourcing some used stuff?
So what else did I forget?  Any interest in forming a race team in
the North-East to share driving/expenses?  Am I nuts - my family
thinks so!   Yes, I know I have to contact Ruth Harte to get the official
PCA Club race rules - so far I'm still day-dreaming but I'd like to buy
a car now, prep over the winter for the '98 season.

Thanks for any input,

Steve Jagernauth   jagernauth_stephen@bns.att.com
'74 911/3.0 and maybe '74 914-2.0 soon
