Patrick Motorsports makes a lot of this stuff.  Look in Pano
or Excellence (or ask Andrew) for the phone number.

My memory has been swiss cheese lately, but I think the
915 tranny mount was about $189 and the 915 cable
shifter was about $700.

If they don't have G50 914-6 conversion stuff you could always
sell the G50 to someone who could use it (it's probably overkill
for your application) and go with the 915 tranny for the 3.6 which
should be fine for almost any job.  Patrick Motorsports makes
a special flywheel to mate the 3.6 to the 915 tranny so the stock
FI will work for about $590.

You also get to buy dual mufflers since the 911 muffler won't
fit with the cable shifter.  In order to avoid having the mufflers
stick out beyond the rear bumper, you need VERY short
mufflers....or you could get some custom headers made which
are about 6" shorter than factory ones.  This'll increase the
variety of mufflers you can buy.

Then you get to make custom muffler hangers and deal
with the clutch....and then the CV/half shaft issue...and
then.....BTDT.  Feel free to e-mail me privately if you
have more questions.

....or you could just buy Andrew's car.  It isn't a 3.6 but
at least it's all finished and sorted out.

Good luck!
