In case i forgot to mention it, the car that i would like to get from BBR
is going to have a body kit put on it.  It will also be changed over from
targa to a full convertible.  That in itself is running around $4500 with
new windows, windshield rake, top, etc...  But on the up side, when i get
finished with this car it will be practically brand new.  The engine i
plan on putting in is a euro 2.0l with FI cause I'm in Cali right now.  
Another $3000.   Then there's the price of the kit and since i don't have
a garage the cost of them doing all the work for me!  I knew it was gonna
cost me, but the more i'm thinking about it the more i'm liking the looks
of the stock 914. Maybe just go with the convertible top as i've always
wanted a convertible, especially now that i'm out here!  I'll let you
guys know what happens.  I found a company that finances Street Rods and
Kitcars so all i have to do is put down 30%.  
Check ya laters,

PS Still lookin' for a 914!  Did i forget to mention the suspension will
also be upgraded to 911 spec with new 993 style 17x8 and 17x9 rims?  Bout
another $1500!
