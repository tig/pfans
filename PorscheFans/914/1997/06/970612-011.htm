        To:         Supporters of SB 42-  Classic Car Smog Check  
        Exemption 
         
        Subject:  -Support at Assembly Transportation Committee  
        Hearing 
         
         
        Thank you again for your support of my SB 42 which would exempt  
        all vehicles 25 or more model years old from the biennial smog  
        check requirement.  I would like to elicit your further support  
        through attendance at the Monday, June 16, 1997 hearing on the  
        bill by the Assembly Transportation Committee.  The hearing will  
        commence at 1:30 p.m. in Room 4202 in the State Capitol in  
        Sacramento. 
         
        It is vitally important that supporters of SB 42 show their  
        support in order to overcome the opposition to the bill by the  
        Air Resources Board and Bureau of Automotive Repair.  Those of  
        you who have written to me in support of the legislation are  
        uniquely qualified to articulate the merits of the proposal and  
        answer questions with regard to the vehicles which would be  
        affected and benefit from the bill. 
         
        I look forward to your attendance at the hearing and that of  
        others who support SB 42.  Your further dissemination of this  
        memorandum and request is also appreciated very much.
