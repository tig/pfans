Since i am not that mechanically knowledged (YET), i was hoping to get
your opinion on a few things.  Would you consider the 914 a high
maintance car?  I know any car 20+ years old will need more maintance
than your average car, but how would the 914 compare to other older cars?
 I am very limited to what i can do myself with an oil change being about
as far as i would trust myself to keep the car in running shape.  And
being on this list with all the questions i see you guys post, i'm
starting to get worried that the 914 might be too much of a car for me to
take care of.  I luv the 914 dearly and hope to own one still, but with
all this about changing CV-joints and even the simple stuff like doing a
tune-up being beyond me, i'd hate to get into a car that i can't even
keep on the road without the assistance of Mr. Goodwrench every other
weekend.  I'd appreciate everyone's opinion on this as it will seriously
affect my desicion on wether to buy or not.  Maybe i'll a little skilled,
just from being on the list.  I know where most of the places are to
check for rust.  I know the little door trick with the top off and sit in
the passenger side and with the window up, if it sticks, that means bad
body flex (major rust usually).  So, i do know a little.  But very
little.  I have know clue about  the D-jets or whatever they are called,
tuning carbs, and dealing with what i feel you guys consider small
problems.  Not to mention the problems that are so easy you don't even
post them on the list.  Anyway, enough babble; please let me know what
you think as i'd hate to put another 914 to death!
Thanx,
