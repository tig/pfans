Having worked on the inner bodies of 914's, I offer this debate:

I have a 4X8 lite utility trailer and two 914's.  I weld and wrangle steel,
but I have not jumped on the idear of mounting a A class hitch to one of my
beloved's and hauling ass to colorado.  (but I have considered it)

-probably the best place to mount a hitch would be the rear tranny
to body mounts, but jeez, there would have to be a large hoop
to clear the exhaust.  Or, remove the exhaust and somehow plumb
the structure along the lower trunk panel and thru the bumper.
That will make it a Serious Undertaking (read: expensive).

This, to me is similar to the butchery exacted upon some 914's to
install air conditioning.  Wouldnt you rather just remove the passenger
seat and pack your stuff on the starboard side?  BTDI

A real problem will be tongue height and weight.  It wont take much
to bottom out the rear of a 914, unless it has stiffer springs. . .
The static load on the trailer will have effect on acceleration and braking,
but if your car's body has rust. . .its a crapshoot as to how safe the run
will be and probability is that something will happen if Murphy has
anything to do with it.

Mountain roads will also pose a threat.  I've had one of my 914's
loaded to the max payload and blitzed around the rockies, but I had
a fresh motor, tires, and Webers (what a heady experience -and
sunburn. . .)

You might want to keep in mind that the body is 30 plus years old. .

-Just my shitassed ruminations. . .
