Hi there,

I am new to this list, and I am planning to build a track car in the near
future out of a 914.  I think my current plan is to buy a '74 or earlier
914-4.  I would like to get a car that is SMOG legal in CA.  Then I plan to
upgrade the brakes, suspension, and add a roll-cage.  From there I will
begin PCA racing, and I eventually hope to add a 6 to my 914.  I am curious
what cost these stages should cost me.

I am guessing I can get a solid 914-4 for under $3K.  Suspension and brakes
should cost me how much?  I believe I can get a cage from Frey Racing in
Mountain View, CA for about $800 ($400 for the cage, $400 labor.)  

OK, so how much will the jump to a 6 cost?  What is actually needed?  How
much fabrication?  Welding?  Finally, is it possibly to do the 6 swap, BUT
still be able to relatively quickly put the 4 back in it?  This would be
especially good for passing SMOG, because there is no way that a converted
914-4 to 6 will pass SMOG, right?

Thanks!
