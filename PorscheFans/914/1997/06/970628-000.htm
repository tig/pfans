Hey Jerry,

I'll offer two possibles for leaks at the front of the engine.
-that are hard to pinpoint.
1)  Oil cooler.
2)  Oil gallery plugs
You might check the oil gallery plugs at the front of the motor just below the 
oil
pump.  These are just pressed in plugs that tend to leak the most when under
pressure, like when running.  Hard to spot when not running, eh?
Fortunately, lower plug

The fix for this is to remove the plug (I used a punch and KO'd a hole in it, 
then
pried the bastard out)  and have a friend lathe out a nice new tapered plug 
with
a threaded hole to pull on next time you want it out.  Or, you could have the 
hole
and plug threaded and screw it together. (tough to do with the engine in the 
car tho')

As for the oil cooler, they dont normally leak, but the seals at the block 
interface
might when under pressure. . .I've never had the problem, so I wont try to 
offer
a solution.

Either way, letting it leak oil might be bad for the motor, but its good for 
the body
-it tends to reduce rust.
