I've got another question about wheel spacers again.  I want
to space out my wheels a bit to better fill out the GT flares
(I admit this is mainly for cosmetic reasons); the wheels are
7"&8"x15 Fuchs.  I've currently got a Carrera front end which
I believe increases the front track 1" over stock.  I was
originally going to use some longer studs and Al wheel spacers,
but have now think I want to use the Weltmeister bolt-on wheel
spacers.  Each one is basically an Al wheel spacer with recesses
so it can be bolted on, plus a set of studs so the wheel can be
bolted to it.
This will primarily be a streetcar, though I may take it out for
track days and the occasional autox (just for fun, not for TTOD,
so I don't care if the car is competitive in class or not).
I call our local ORPCA track committee contact, and he said
that they would be legal for track use, so I think they should
be pretty safe.  Does anyone have any pros/cons about using
these that I should consider?

Thanks,
Mike
