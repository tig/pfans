I'm not any good about writing up stuff like this so don't expect too
much here, but I can say there are some fantastic cars down here!  And
there is nothing like coming around a corner in a parking lot and
finding yourself looking out across a virtual sea of Porsche's.
Everything from a 1954 356 to brand-new Boxters.  911's of all colors,
conditions, years - Turbos, Carrera 4 S's, SC's, RSR's, RS America's,
you name it.  928's, 944's, 924's, and yes, lots and lots of our own
beloved 914's.

I didn't see the final results for the concours (ie, don't know who one
best-of-show), but out of the 8 class winners, 3 of them were 914's - an
orange 914-6, a white/orange special edition, and the most beautiful 6
conversion I've ever seen (steel flares, windmills, 3.4 litre engine
with a custom designed FI system, flawless paint and interior, etc. etc
- and the guy did all the work himself and is very friendly in talking
about his car).  So our marque was certainly well represented there!

They rally was a blast!  My wife and I took 1st place in the
'unequipped' class and 6th overall - we were both very excited as this
was our first rally ever.  The overall winner received a set of tires
from Yokohama - any tire, any size up to 17"!  If only they had given a
set to each of the class winners....  Oh well, we did get a pair of nice
jackets from them.  And the trophies were beer steins!

The autocross started Wed. morning and will continue through Fri.
afternoon.  I haven't had a chance to see any of it yet 'cause I'm stuck
in here at work right now, but my wife and I run tomorrow morning (class
I-1 because of the carbs on our otherwise very stock 914) and then will
be working the event the rest of the day.

We also drove over to Texas World Speedway on Saturday to watch the last
of the club race - it was awesome.  The sound of 15 Porsches screaming
by at 150mph is indescribable!  There was a little excitement when
Norwood Racing's $400,000 race car's left front wheel left the car on
the straight away.  The car is apparently so stiff, that the driver
didn't even notice it until halfway around the track when he had to make
a right-hand curve.  He drove it the rest of the way around and back
into the pit area - I wonder if a crewman got fired over that one?

I'm gonna put a plug in here for Paragon Products so if you don't want
to read advertisement, skip this paragraph.  I'm not associated with
them and barely know Jason Burkett, but I'm really impressed with their
obvious commitment to the Porsche world.  They've donated several $100
gift certificates for door prizes and Jason is walking around talking
shop with anyone who wants to.  If any of you guys need anything that
they can get for you, give them a call.  They've got good prices, a
small catalog, tons of expertise and experience both on and off the
track, and, if I remember correctly, free shipping on any order over
$50.  Jason's also a regular on this list and drives/races a 914
himself.

Have a good one.
