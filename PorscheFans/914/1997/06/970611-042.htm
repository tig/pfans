Kerry's systems are pretty much the industry standard for 914-4 headers.
And I'm closer than ever to getting a set of headers for my little car.
The Hunter system is a 4 into 1, 1-5/8 tube setup. I've always wanted to
get a 4 into 2 into 1 system, to help out the midrange as well. A 4-2-1
sould yeild slightly better torque than a 4-1. I may have a line on a
used Webber (not the carb manufacturer) system, the kind I've always
wanted but couldn't afford. Stub pipes that mount to the heads and the
headers mount to the stub pipes, nickel plated stainless (it's a demo
show piece) and all mandril bent tubing. I havn't heard back on the
asking price though. The Hunter system sells for about $450 including a
supertrapp muffler.

For those planning on removing their heat exchangers for possibly the
first time ever, I recomend "kroyil" penetrant. Actually, it was
recomended to me by a number of top notch P-car tweakers, the legendary
H.G. Bieker amoung them.

Who was it that said they were installing Stainless Steel exhaust studs?
I made some off the cuff calculations and figured that thermal expansion
would not really be a problem. So, where did you get them? Are there any
more available? How much were they? BTW, if you're installing SS studs,
DO NOT use SS nuts as well. They may have a tendancy to gall unless one
or the other is plated with something. Carbon steel on stainless is
fine, silver plating (or zinc) on stainless is fine too. But SS on SS
may cause some galling problems.
