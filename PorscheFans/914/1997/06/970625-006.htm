I also collect die-cast models and I'm certainly interested any other =
914's!

What is the mail-order place that has these?

Your idea of a bulk order has some appeal, but I don't see how a mere =
savings of 10% ($2.80 each) is going to be worth the hassle of a group =
order. By the time you get boxes and packing material to reship each =
suborder, plus pay a couple of bucks postage, plus charge everyone their =
fair share of the shipping cost from the mail-order place to you -- the =
savings to us would be nominal at best, but you'd have gone to a lot of =
effort. The group book orders that have been done before were worth it =
because they saved people 60% ($30) per book over the regular sources.
