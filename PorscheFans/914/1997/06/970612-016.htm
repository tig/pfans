Mark, There is no substitute for a proper factory replacement of rusted
parts, but many 914s are too labor intensive and therefore too costly to
repair.  Since virtually all 914s "get it" in the rocker sections
especially on the battery side (and unfortunatlly on a 914 this causes body
sag), we devised a method by which a good driving but sagging 914 could be
kept road worthy on a budget-  that is by reinforcing the chassis.
Howecver we have to deal with two problems:  First that the body, sagging,
was out of alignment, and secondly that there was not much to weld to.  The
way we overcome the problems were as follows:
1:  We cut perfect rust free rocker sections out of straight 914s and
carefully measured them.(we could not use new parts as the rocker clamshell
encompasses several of these pieces and since they could not be welded
together on a factory jig, we could not get an accurate measurement.) We
had to measure at least eight different sections and get an average measure
as they were all slightly different! This enabled us to sculpt a piece that
reached from the front of the inner rocker, around the jack post, to the
front middle of the wheelhouse where the outer rear suspension console is
attached, and also attached to the door frame seal pinch joint and down to
the bottom of the inner rocker where the screw holes are for the rocker
cover.  The piece exactly mimmicks the original configuration of the four
original parts it covers, so it fits precisely-  precisely enough to align
the body shell back to its presagging condition.
2. To allow enough to weld the clamshell to a rusty, allow easy
installation, and cover enough to support the weakened chassis, the piece
entails removal of the sill plate(most of them are rusty anyway and the
piece is easily removed by drilling the spotwelds) drilling many small
holes and spot welding (or riviting you riviters!) and seam welding onto
the car.  Since many 914s will also have a rusty longitudinal, the piece is
a heavier gauge than the factory metal and coated stock as to inhibit rust.
The unit is so long it takes a special press to stamp and therefore costs a
bit to produce.
  This project has been going on for over four years and we are producing
the parts I write.  We have seen too many 914s go by the wayside that were
perfectly drivable but unable to open the doors and much too expensive to
repair in the conventional way.  When installed, the rocker clamshells
exactly mimmick the original configuration so that at first glance one
believes the 914 has never been rusted! Finally as an added benefit, the
racers will like the shells because they reinforce a good
chassis-especially in the area of the front door piller where the 914 is a
notorious  flexer!
  Jim I hope this is a good explaination.  There should be an upcoming
product release in both European Car and Kit Car magazine, and we are doing
a tech article that will be featured in the magazines as well as be
included as an instruction pamphlet with each kit
