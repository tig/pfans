Hello again.

Another issue is that the oil temp. gauge is not working.
Wired correctly (not difficult), but I need to test it 
out in a boiling water bath as I think the sender may be
mismatched with the gauge.  The gauge is a VDO that reads
to 300F - can't remember what the sender is marked but it
is in degrees C.

I know in principle it is a termistor, but how does it get 
it's ground signal?   Mine is mounted at the cover on the
bottom of the crankcase.  The sender sticks up into the
case with a connector at the end, but seems to be insulated
otherwise.  Perhaps - I'll just fiddle with it and see if 
I can get it working for a watertest.  Just wondering where
the sender connects to ground as it seems the cover plate 
keeps is isolated from the case and therefore chassis ground.
