I must be missing something.  My owners manual for my 914 says 155R 15's were
standard for early 4's and 165 R 15's were an option, and standard on 2.0's.
 Never seen 175 R 15's on a stock 914 from the factory.  The stock size for
the 14x5.5 wheel for the 6 was a 185 R 14, which has about the same rolling
diameter as the 165 R 15.
