Thanks Dave, I have the fuel pump going just fine.

What I was wondering about was if  anybody had any recommendations on
weather or not to run a fuel pump shut off switch that is activated upon
an impact, example if for some reason I toast into an Armco.  I would
like the fuel pump to shut off in case of an accident.  Just wanting to
be a little safer that is all. 

I have seen these in Pano and was looking for experience personnel or
second hand. 

Take care,
