Hi all can u help me? I need to know if this is a good deal. Please if you
have the time respond to me at dmer@aol.com because I have to give an answer
on whether or not I'm buying sometime today.

I'm looking at a 74 2 litre for $4000. It has dealer installed air, it works
but fan doesn't work on highest setting. It needs a shift coupler between the
firewall and the shift rod. (So I can't drive it but it sounds great... has a
bursch exhaust.) It has 5 original fuchs alloys with comp TAs 205 60/15 and
the engine has been modified to a big valve head (with chevy valves) and dual
webers and has been reringed. It may also have a cam... the owner passed away
so I'm dealing with his wife and she's not 100% sure. The car she tells me is
sometimes tempermental due to the modified engine and doesn't make a good
daily driver but, "is one hell of an autocross car" her words. It has koni's
on the rear and 140lb springs with swaybars front and rear.

The car was painted about 2 years ago and I can see some rust coming up in a
spot or two and the battery tray area was repaired. The paint is 7 out of 10
and the interior has a couple small tears and non-original carpets and is 7
out of 10 condition also.

I've never owned a 2 liter, always 1.7s, so any advice you can give as what
to look for etc would be appreceiated... price is non-negotiable. She says
she has other people wanting it if I don't. Should I buy it? It would
strictly be a third car in our house fun autocross and weekend driver.

Thanks again,
ben aka dmer@aol.com
