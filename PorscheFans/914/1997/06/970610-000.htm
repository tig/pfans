Hello everyone,

I bought another 914 a couple of weeks ago a 74 1.8L that was side
swiped, but it ran, drives and all the good things.  It was a steal  I
could not pass it up.  But anyway, when I got it, I was told the number 4
injector was bad.  It was hard to start but did run and leaked liked a
sieve.  But I got it onto the trailer under its own power amazing.  
The trip home was uneventful except all the looks I got going thru a
drive thru with the trailer and car.

I got home and started to check it out, I have a few extra 1.8L injectors
around so I thought simple enough.  Took the items off, pulled the whole
intake on that side.  And the took off the injector.  And instantly found
the problem, the hose had dried out on the bottom and cracked causing a
fuel leak.  Fixed it and now the car purrs along like a kitten, start
almost instantly if the battery is fully charged.

Moral to the story:  Check the fuel lines, and replace them at the first
signs of cracking.  It is not a bad idea to do it just because it is
there.  Fire is a bad thing to have happen to your 914.  

Anybody got a tech paper on any of those fuel system cut off swatches
that turn off the  fuel pump in the event of a major accident?

Also if you just bought a car check everything out or have it done,
before going anywhere with it.  I found this car was 2 quarts low on oil.
 The tranny was okay, but very dirty lube, properly changed that.  And
will be giving the car a complete tune-up and vac hoses this weekend,
just because I am here.  Rerouting al the wires so they make sense and I
don't have ignition wires going to every corner of the compartment.  They
used some generic 8mm wires that look like they came for a V-8, but they
are blue. I think that was the selling factor.  Adjusted the clutch,
checked the tire pressures, and adjusted the valves.  And did a bunch of
minor things just to make it right.

Take care,
Stephen Jacobs
