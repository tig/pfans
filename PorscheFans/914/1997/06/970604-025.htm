Hi Mike!  (and anyone else that may be interested)

   Yikes!  Drill a hole in a fragile (and expensive) 2.0 litre head??  Not me!  

  I don't know what type of cylinder head temperature sensor you have; mine is the VDO aftermarket 
one that recommends that the sensor ( it is a simple bi-metalic thermocouple crimped into a giant 
eyelet terminal ) be mounted under a spark plug, or alternatively, under a head bolt.  I mounted mine 
under the FI Temp Sensor II, which screws into the right side head above #3 cylinder.  If you have a 
Haynes book, check out fig. 21.10 on page 35.  I'm not sure that it is a 2.0 litre head pictured, but the 
2.0 has a sensor in the same general location.   This mounting allows the electrical leads to exit the 
engine sheetmetal via the same seal as the regular Temp Sensor II wire, making for a neat 
installation.  It seems to work fine in this location, showing typical CHT's of between 325 and 350 
degrees F.

  I hope that this is of some help.

                                                  Regards,
                                                  Jim T.
