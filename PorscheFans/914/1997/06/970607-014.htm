Keith, my feelings are hurt that you do not like my 2nd grade artwork!  I
drew that diagram myself in desperation and everone seems amused by it!(we
actually need someone to draw many technical pictures for our new catalog
and the 914 technical manual we are compiling).  I cannot quite answer your
question, but as you know the 3.5 hose is used for vacuum advance on early
74 1.8 models as well as fuel pressure regulator and decel valve.  On late
74 models it is also used for the engine bay mounted charcoal cannister.
The line for the regulator runs at the back of the engine and tees with a
connection to the decel valve and the plentum. The vacuum advance(early 74
models only) connects to the back of the throttle body, and the engine
mounted charcoal cannister connects the the small cathiter coming out of
the firewall(late 74 and 75 models only)
