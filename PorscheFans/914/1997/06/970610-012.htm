I have a 944 Turbo I am trying to sell.  I enjoy the car a great deal,
but have decided that it will be too expensive for me to prepare it for
track, and so am selling it in favor of a 914.
This car is mechanically in excellent condition.  It was hit lightly in
the rear quarter panel.  All body work has been done, but the subsequent
paint job was not very good.  The paint has begun to peal in a couple of
places.  The frame is very straight, and the car drives very straight. 
I
have replaced the water pump, and the belts/rollers within 6 months.
 Other info - Black, Tan lthr, Sony 10 CD, New Dunlops, 84K mi., 1988
(not S), BBS 16" Alloys. New York Area.

I will take $9K for the car.  This is good $3-5K cheaper than market.
This car would be an ideal track car, or a great performance car for
someone not overly concerned with appearance.

I also have a set of factory 16" 993 alloys (with spacers for 944T) that
I would sell for $1.5K which is exactly what I paid for them, in place
of
the BBSs or separately.

Any interested parties, please e-mail me at
