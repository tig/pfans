I didn't have a compressor handy when I removed mine, and I was too scared
to just simply remove the top nut without some way of preventing the spring
from shooting through the wall, so I used a pair of tie-down straps to sinch
the spring in place.  That worked just dandy, and was better than waking the
neighbor at 1AM.....

I'd like to hear what you find out; I'll need to do that same with the 911
engine pretty soon.  Dunno that I want to heat up the heads with a torch
though....
