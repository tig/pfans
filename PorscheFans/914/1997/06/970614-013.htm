Hi, J.J.!

to blame.

  You're right!

  I am not sure from this whether or not you have removed all the gray 
jacket around the wire bundles or not.  If you have, it should be a simple 
matter to locate the problem, by flexing one wire at a time.  If the jackets 
are still in place, do this:  grab each wire group where it goes to a 
specific sensor, and wiggle the groups one at a time.  See if you can 
isolate the problem to a particular sensor.  If the problem seems not to 
be on the ends, grab the harness in both hands, and flex only a few 
inches between your hands, trying to keep the rest of the harness as 
still as possible.  Pulling is a good thing to do;  if a wire is broken 
beneath the insulation, this will cause it to seperate.  Work your way 
down the harness, and see if you can't isolate the problem this way.

  Can't hurt.

  This is extremely important; I'm surprised that you haven't cleaned this 
up already.

  Two more things:  Grounds!  Check the 4 push-on terminals that attach 
to the through-bolt on the engine case.  Make sure that the wires are in 
good shape, with no broken strands, and no corrosion.  Strip back to 
clean wire and crimp on new ends if there is any doubt.  Also check the 
grounding strap on the gearbox for tightness, cleanliness and all 
strands present.

>  Is there any "professional" way to fix those seven whittled wires? 

  There is such a thing as "liquid tape" which, if applied in several light 
coats can be neater than Scotch 33... otherwise, the only way to fix this 
is to cut the wires, slip some shrink tube over them, splice them back 
together with solder, and shrink the shrink-tube over the splices.  This is 
probably more trouble than it's worth.  A good neat tape job should be 
adequate.

  You don't say what color smoke... too rich will not hurt for awhile; too 
lean can cause over-temp problems and possibly burnt valves.

  This might be a solution, but be sure to ask whether or not they have a 
D-Jetronic test set (or L-Jet if that's what you've got)... if they don't have 
a test set, and smog equipment besides, so that they can see what's 
happening to the mixture while they are poking and prodding, they are 
just groping around, the same way you are, and why pay someone 
else to do something that you can do just as well yourself?


  I wish you the best of luck in getting your 914 up and running.
