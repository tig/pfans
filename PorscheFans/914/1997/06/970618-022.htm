Hello 914ers......I have seen several people discussing chassis integrity,
"GT" style chassis reinforcements and the longitudinal "clamshell" repair
pieces.  Its great to see the discussions of owners taking care of their 914s
chassis.  I agree with everyone (you too George) concerned with keeping these
old roadsters straight and safe to use.    
To answere one question recently posted - I have used Brad Mayeurs'
longitudinal pieces (clamshells).  I would also recommend them, especially
for longitudinal rust repairs.  I understand that Brad has been working on
914s since they were first being sold.  He is very knowledgable and has a
obvious commitment to keeping our favorite Porsche alive.  Because he is in
the north (Salt-belt) many of the cars he has been serviceing have been
attacked by excelelrated rusting in the longitudinals.  Hence the idea of
these repair pieces became a reality.  Each longitudinal is a piece that runs
full length of the rocker pannel and extends past the jack point into the
outer, rear suspension console area.  It can be used in full length or
trimmed to suit specific repair needs. 
I bought a pair of these longitudinals to add support to a car that is going
to be used in a V-8 conversion (disclaimer - not my idea!).  This car has
very good longitudinals but with the added HP and weight some additional
strenghtening was in order and these pieces did the trick.  A cage wasn't
desireable as street use and access were important considerations.  Their
installation requires rear suspension removal and careful welding.
 Instructions are included to help understand how to do the job correctly.
 They even addresses 914s that are sagging and how to sopport them while
installing these pieces to ensure the correct door gaps are regained.  There
are pictures of the longitudinal at http://www.why.net/users/a914drvr/.
The chassis kits are modeled after the Porsche 914-6 GT pieces.  They were
designed as a fix on the 914-6 racers that were flexing badly.  In fact some
of these cars were twisting and braking windshields.  These 12 piece kits do
require a lot of welding and if cosmetic perfection is in order, grinding,
seam sealing and undercoating or painting will add aditional time.  I have
gone through several installations recently so feel free to ask questions.
 To help with the kits installation I have prepared instructions and
pictorial references.
For any of you that were at the St. Louis track June 7th and 8th for the
national SCCA races you may remember an orange 914-4 GT3, car (#17).  This
vintage racer was on of 27 SCCA GT cars racing that weekend.  It is a
semi-tube 914 that has just added this kit.  The owner/driver will tell you
his success in beating ALL the GT2 cars and setting a fast lap for all but
the three GT1 cars is partly due to the improved handling this kit afforded.
 Driving skill and luck helped also!  My point is there is value in adding
these pieces which help strengthen the 914s chassis.  They certainly don't
need to be on all 914s but might be good additions to cars intended for dual
purpose use, dedicated racers or conversion cars.  If you are curious about
installation details feel free to e-mail me and I'll send you a copy of the
text instructions.
Both kits will greatly improve the cars stiffness which is important for
longevity and safety as well as great handling.
