These are mounted on 914 Fuchs alloys (15x5.5).  I don't have any info
about the offset for the ATSs, but on the Fuchs, they fit really nice.
At full lock they do rub the inner front fender well at the back of the
tire just slightly, but not enough to be a problem.  I suppose if you
cranked the steering all the way over and ran 100 miles in as tight a
turn as the 914 can do then you might start seeing a problem, but
really, how often and for how long a duration and at what speed do you
really drive with your wheel turned all the way?
