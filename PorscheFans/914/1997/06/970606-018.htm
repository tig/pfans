 Kevin, 

 The deals are here, you cant find a much better market than California.
Well as far as finding a none rusty 914, compared to an east coast car.
 Conversions of any kind will run big bucks ! thats way so many of us
out here are doing projects, and remember when you buy or pay to have a
car done it will cost you at least 30% more than if you did it your
self.
 As far as Pomona go's there should be a few nice 914's out there and
like I said, if you get your butt out of bed and meet me at the gate,
you can ride in with me for free.

 Later, 
 Don
