Amusing isn't it? The lowly 914 has been seen as such a threat in SCCA
that it's been bumped through three classes in the last, what, 4 or so
years. Geez, we must the ultimate autox car or somethin' huh? :) :)

Bernie, one reason that the 914 has been bumped so much is that in the
eyes of SCCA, "there is no such thing as a STOCK 914 anymore". There is
truth in that, but I don't buy it as a reason to bump the car. Enforce
the rules or don't. But simply bumping the car so far up in the class
structure that people won't even bring their 914s out is counter
productive, and smacks of marque-bigotry.

On that note, good luck on finding fresh stock springs for your 914.
Steve Compton, one of the top 914 drivers in SCCA, told me an amusing
tale about stock springs. At one point he searched far and wide and
finally found never-used stock springs still in the plastic in some
storage house somewhere. He installed the springs and then left the car
in the garrage due to snow. Over the course of two weeks, without ever
touching the car in any way, the springs sagged over 1/2". So for
finding stock springs, good luck. 

So what is this about different size springs? If you have ANY
documentation to prove it, I'm sure there are a few 914 stock drivers
that would LOVE to get ahold of that info.
