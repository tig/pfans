Your original premise is based on an ideal situation where either all
four wheels are sticking optimally or all four are sliding completely.
In this case we _are_ in free space. The car might as well be floating
in space or on a sheet of ice or teflon more appropriately.

PMI (Polar Moment of Inertia) is the inertia of an object as it relates
to its rotation (i.e. a car spinning). The mass of the bumper has just
as much weight (mathematically speaking) in calculating the PMI as the
mass of the motor. You need to take into account _all_ mass of the car,
not just that between the front and rear wheels. Hell, there are alot of
high performance cars, 911s included, that place the engine outside the
wheelbase while the CM remains inside the wheelbase. If we were to
exclude all mass that was outside the wheelbase when the center of mass
is between the wheels in our calculations, we'd be making a grevious
error. And scaring the piss out of our poor test driver the first time
he/she took the car out on the test track. =8-O

My example above yields two very different PMIs, but the CM (Center of
Mass) remains the same, in the middle. Here's one way of looking at it.
What is easier to get spinning, a bicycle wheel with a very heavy solid
rubber tire? Or the same bicycle wheel with the same amount of rubber
concentrated about the hub instead? Both wheels have the same center of
mass, but the later example is going to be alot easier to initiate
spinning and equally so to halt its spinning. Think of it as the rubber
wheel mass having a much larger lever arm to exert on _your_ force, be
it acceleration or braking, than the equally massive rubber hub. This is
why we are much more interested in shaving off every little bit weight
from the wheels, while weight off the hubs has noticably less
consequence where it comes to how rapidly we can get the car to
accelerate. So, get the engine (the singly most massive part of the car)
as close to the hub (or center of the car) if we want a car that can
change direction as rapidly as possible. But we have to be prepared for
the consequences of making a "wheel" able to change states so easilly,
it will also tend to be much more difficult to coax back into a straight
line if it gets away from us. We've all been there at one point or
another, where our 914 has gotten away from us, havn't we? :)

Unfortunately, the real world doesn't lend itself very readilly to basic
analyses. I remember once, a friend of mine went through a great deal of
effort over the course of over a year to produce a thesis on billiard
ball mechanics. Forget modeling a combination shot, or for that matter a
cue hitting another ball. It was phenomenally complex to just model,
accurately, the mechanics of just a single ball rolling along an
infinite felt surface if the directional component of the spin vector
wasn't _exactly_ equal to that of the velocity vector. Even if it was an
ideal roll, the felt alone had quite a significant effect on the ball.
Over short distances, a simple classical model still worked ok. But over
distance, the model became more and more complex as more and more higher
order terms became significant. Sadly, his seminar was shot full of
holes by one of the profs at the time, it was a greusome sight. But he
was able to recover in time for his final draft. 
 
BTW Dirk, this is in no way meant as a flame. I'm just having fun
spouting physics for the first time in ages. And hopefully shed some
more light on the voodoo we call "handling characteristics". You can
tell I'm kinda bored, can't you? :)
