Yes I have heard of several and seen a  few of them in person.
Sure it will work, but there is a lot more to a turbo engine install than
just a turbo.  On the 914 the  2.0 has low enough compression that it
will work, but your injection system is now where near being up to the
task.  The D-jet is not  good choice in a turbo application, but again
can be made to work.  Another short fall the a turbo 914 is the oil drain
back to the tank.  MSDS used a pump in some of there kits, to get the oil
back up hill to the sump.  Air charge temps become a concern, as do
leaning out the fuel mixture. You will also run into problems with the
head lifting off the barrels in a modest boast situation 15 psi or so,
3-7 is practical.  More than this start digging into your pocket book. 
If this is a daily driver you will have to run some custom header or heat
exchangers.  If this is a race car, well read your rule book.  In PCA
auto-x this little change bumps you into M5 (not the BMW) alone.  Like
anything it can be done, but you may be better off putting you money
somewhere else.  A 2.0L eurospec engine can be a fun car.  And the little
2.0 have been know to make pretty good HP with slight modifications. 
European car is currently doing an article on a 2.0L rebuild/performance
hop ups.  And GRM (Grass Roots Motorsports) has just picked up a 74 914
2.0 to run as a project car / PCA J class car.  Hey all you J classers
will have another car to run with next year.  

I suggest you read up on the engine and what it is capable of, and get
some seat time in the car then make the engine mods.  You will find the
engine is not the place this cr shines it is the handling.  And a bigger
smile will come to your face going around a corner than will ever happen
in a straight line.  If you are going to proceed drop me a note I have
several past articles that may be of some use to you.  And you may want
to call MSDS and see if they still produce there kit for the 4cly
engines.

>Can I add strut tower braces without to much problem. 

Which end of the car front or rear?  Oh well, if you ment the front
forget it, it is already a standard feature.  That piece of metal holding
your carpet in a vertical plane is a structured strut tower brace. 
Batter than any tube you can buy.  Yes again you can do it, but why, just
to say you have one.  We all do unless you are running a fuel cell and
cut out that section of the fire wall.

Now if it is the back, I say forget it and get some seat time.  Very few
run with a strut brace out back, a stiffing kit (Rich Johnson's
A914Guy@AOL.com) is a very good piece, and it stiffens the rear strut
towers as well.. plus the front mount area for the suspension arm and the
rear box section to just behind the jack post. The center cockpit section
is in need of stiffening also.  A cage, bolt down top, or a rocker panel
kit will do that job well.  If using a bolt down top you also need to
stiffening the windshield posts.

> Any info would be greatly appreciated.

I hope that was enough, welcome to the list and enjoy your 914.

Take care,
