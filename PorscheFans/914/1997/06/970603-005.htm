Hi Josh and Dirk (and the rest of the list)

  I have been following this discussion with interest... sounds like there's an opportunity here for Dave 
D. to set up a simulation at his lab... maybe a virtual 914 can answer our questions; who knows... it 
might even be more fun than the real thing!  (But I doubt it!)  (Just cheaper!)

  I was just digging through some old notes and I remember a classic problem from high school 
physics.  Two identical masses are placed side by side on an inclined plane and are released 
simultaneously (within the relativistic limitations of that word).  One mass is in the form of a rolling ring, 
and the other is in the form of a thick disk.  The diameters are identical.  Which gets to the bottom of 
the inclined plane first?  As I recall, the disk does, because of the definition of angular momentum.  
  Hey Josh, lecture us a bit more, if you please... wouldn't Polar Moment of Inertia simply equate to 
Rotational Inertia (according to my notes:  I=mr^2 for ring ;  I=2/3mr^2 for disk.  Of course, I suppose 
one would have to integrate all the masses and their distribution using calculus to get a formula for a 
914, but is this the general idea?  Or am I way off base?

  My notes also show that rotational acceleration, alpha (sorry... no greek letters in this font) is = 
average torque / I  (rotational inertia from above).

  And, if this crude analysis has some validity, I don't understand why it is difficult to stop the rotation 
of the car once it starts.  The torque is proportional to the lever arm of the wheels with respect to the 
center of mass (right?), while the rotational inertia is less for mass concentrated in the center.  So... if  
one assumes the exact same tires and wheels, the torque tending to stop a spin ought to be 
identical for a car with any mass distribution (so long as the weight bias remained 50-50), but if the 
rotational inertia is greater, then the rotational acceleration, alpha, (in our case, negative 
acceleration, because we are trying to stop a spin) is greater for a car with smaller I.  Therefore, the 
914 ought to be easier to spin, but also easier to recover.  Or is this all wet?

  Please spout some more physics, Josh... a free education is a wonderful thing!

                                        Thanks,
                                        Jim T.
