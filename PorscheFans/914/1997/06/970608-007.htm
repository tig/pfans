Hello all,

More 914 stuff out of the stash in the barn!

I have a rear reflector kit, you know the one "PORSCHE" across it to go
between the lights in the rear, and eliminates the trunk lock.  This one
has an electric silonode and bracket.  Used but in excellent condition
with all hardware... $75 with shipping in the continental USA.

Also an excellent center console for an A/C equipped car.  Pulled with
only 28,000 original miles includes the shift boot leather, and heater
control different form stock unit.  No gauges sorry!  ....  $75 with
shipping in the continental USA.

And while we are on the subject of center consoles, I have another
excellent unit full size with gauges, boot, and heater controls.  And the
clock seems to work, amazing but true, not sure of the accuracy because
the parts car it is coming out of has a drastic battery drain, like over
night, dead battery.  But it moved from 6:00 to 9:30 the last time I
checked I have since been disconnecting the battery. ..... $100 with
shipping in the continental USA.  All other instruments work as well.

914 Dash cap with no cracks, chips, or other maladies, very nice piece
.....  $150 with shipping in the continental USA.

Rear bumper cap in very nice condition, needs some TLC to bring back to
100%, but is straight, not deformed and overall nice condition, for 70-74
bumpers about a 90% piece has some marks for P.O. misuse of wax....
$85.00 with shipping in the continental USA.

Take care,
