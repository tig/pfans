Hi Dave!

  I have $.02 to put in on the matter of CO.

  I don't think that this is consistent with the chemistry that I learned in 
school...  We should get Josh Hadler to jump in on this one, no one 
gets a degree in physics without getting a fair dose of chemistry along 
the way...  Here's how I remember things:  There is a law called the Law 
of Definite Proportions, which simply states that elements combine to 
form compounds in a definite and predictable way, and that for 
example, 2 grams of H2 ought to combine with 16 grams of O2 to 
produce 18 grams of water. 
  In our case, incomplete combustion can produce CO, but CO reacts 
with O2 to form CO2 according to the following equation: 
 2(CO) + O2 -> 2(Co2)

   Therefore, I strongly doubt that richening up your mixture will result in 
reducing your CO, because you will be adding carbon, not oxygen to 
the equation.  An excessively lean mixture will result in rotten 
performance, elevated engine temperature, excess NOx, but should 
REDUCE any tendency toward excessive CO.  As I recall, one of the 
original problems in smog engine design was due to the fact that when 
unburned hydrocarbons and CO were the concerns, the solution was 
simply to run hotter and leaner, which did in fact, work.  It was then that 
somebody noticed that the elevated temperatures and oxygen rich 
environment resulting produced various oxides of nitrogen, which, 
when allowed to combine with moisture in the atmosphere, produced 
nitric acid... which isn't much fun to breathe either.   The problem then 
became one of balancing the reductions of all three types of 
emissions, while simultaneously allowing the engine to do it's original 
job: run well enough to propell the car.  This problem was not solved 
satisfactorily until the 1980's with a combination of catalytic converters, 
air pumps, and micro-processor controlled fuel injection.

  All of which, of course, the 914 lacks.  All that I can suggest is that you 
lean out as much as you can... perhaps reduce the fuel pressure a bit, 
make sure that your temp sensor II is in good shape, and connect it 
directly to the computer, bypassing your mixture adjust knob for now.  
Make sure that your air cleaner element is clean and non-restrictive, 
and you might try fudging the ignition timing a bit... I don't know which 
way... this would be a matter of cut and try.  Be sure that you have NEW 
plugs in the engine, and that the ignition system overall is in good 
shape... if you are still running the original point-type ignition, try new 
points, condenser, and plug wires.

  Lastly, shop around for a Porsche garage that has smog measuring 
equipment, and let them tweak it.  When they say go, try again.

  I wish you the best of luck, and I think that the long term solution to this 
problem is to stand around the exits from smog stations with petitions to 
qualify an initiative statue for the '98 elections that would repeal smog II, 
and require that all further tightening of the regs be submitted to the 
voters, with a 2/3 majority required for passage.

  Any lawyers on the list that want to volunteer to draft such a thing?

                                        Regards,
                                        Jim T.
