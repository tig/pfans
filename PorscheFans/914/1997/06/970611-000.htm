Hi Walker!

  Mike Lee has good advice here; the circlip will have to be removed first.  I used a gear puller on the 
outside of my inboard CV joints (after removing the circlip); they came off the half-shafts with very little 
effort.

  I have not tried this myself, but it seems to me that the half-shaft assembly should make an excellent 
slide-hammer (sometimes called a dent puller).  I'd try collapsing the outboard CV joint fully, and 
then pull on the half-shaft as hard as I could.  It should pop out pretty abruptly, and should carry the 
CV joint with it (provided that all the bolts are removed), if not on the first try, then with a few good 
whacks.    Another possibility is to ascertain where the roll pins are located, and then simply apply 
bending moment to the half-shaft in the same plane as the two roll pins.  This should seperate the 
one on the outside of the bend, and possibly, allow the entire joint to be removed.   A combination of 
the two movements should do the job, although, as I said, I have not had the outer ones apart (yet).

  I also have a couple of questions for Jeff Lorentzen:

   First, I am not sure that the roll pin mod is necessary; I had little trouble getting my inboard joints 
apart.  I have not yet tried the outboard ones, as I said, but I am rather surprised at the implication in 
your messages that the stub axel must be removed to accomplish this.  Are you sure it cannot be 
done with stub axels in place?  If I ever have to take my outboard joints apart, I will try like heck to 
avoid pulling the stub axels.

  Second,  I am most curious as to the failure mode of the wheel bearing that you mentioned.  I at first 
assumed that there were two bearings, one on the stub axel and one on the hub, which would, of 
course, put enormous bending loads on the outboard bearing if the inboard bearing were removed.  
However, in examining the pictures in the Haynes book, I can find evidence of only one bearing, and 
that bearing connects the wheel hub and the trailing arm.  Hence, the loads on the bearing should be 
identical with or without the stub axel present (less without, actually, because, of course, no power 
loading can be on the bearing with the half-shaft disconnected) and therefore, it should be perfectly 
OK to move the car under these conditions.
  One thought occurs:  if the inner race is in two parts, then there could be compressive pre-load on 
the bearing with the stub axel in place and the nut tight, and without this preload, the bearing might 
tend to come apart.  Is this correct?

                                                  Regards,
                                                  Jim T.
