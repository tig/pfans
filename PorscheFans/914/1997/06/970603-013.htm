Ahh, Now I've got it. You're interested in that actuall transition
point. That's different, and more complex as well.

I'm still not following. Why are you picking the center between the rear
wheels? And the center of rotation, in a freely spinning 914, is not
between the rear wheels. It's at the CM. And if it's sticking, it's
still not rotating about the rear wheels.

Got it! :) But a mid engined car is built that way to put the CM in the
middle of the car, not between the rear wheels. The 911 is closer to
this example. And the most dramatic would be if the CM is close to the
center of the car. The least dramatic would be with the masses of the
car concentrated more to the bumpers. Like a 911 or 944. The 911 has
it's own handling quirks as well.

I think we're both on the same page now.

Yes, in theory. But the low PMI car is going to respond so quickly that
most attempts of a human driver to recover a spin will more likely
induce an under-damped oscillation. The low PMI car responds so quickly
and can change state so quickly, that a human _may_ not be able to
respond fast enough. And may simply make a bad situation worse. Not that
it can't be done, just requires more skill and reflexes. 

I think we can put this thread to rest at this point eh?
