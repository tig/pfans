what's up

anyway I lied I just couldn't stay away  from my car and spent a good four 
hours on it today

I bought the idiot book and I am totally impressed

I did all the tests that he said to do on the F.I. system, by the way the 
author said that he didn't like the F.I. system ---- was to expensive for this 
type of car

everything checked out fine until I got to the throttle valve switch

I got the ohm meter to go to 0.00 when the butterfly was close to and 
completely closed -- anyway I wanted to see what it looked like inside so I 
took the cap off ---- it was a little weird looking as I expected
it is pretty new so I'm not worried about it being worn out yet but I think 
high performance house didn't adjust it right---- it wouldn't close all the way 
it look like the guy turned it clockwise instead of counterclock wise

anywayall the little prongs were making contact to the bottom or top of the 
thing I guess it is all in the way you look at it , except for one ---- the # 9 
one was not connecting to the base of the thing

is it sappost to be this way or did I or the guy who installed it the first 
time screw it up, the only explanation that I have is that I snagged it on the 
cap as I was taking it off

remember I do have a 1.7 so I don't know if this is different than the 2.0
but I would appreciate any info despite that.
