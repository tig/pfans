You have an external oil cooler but not an oil pressure gauge?  That'll
tell you when starvation occurs since the sender is at the end of an
oil galley directly above the oil pump itself...

Also - to everyone.  Going to start my baby up this weekend and finally
to the time to plumb and wire up my oil temperature gauge - what are
typical good operating temperatures for our cars - what is the danger
zone.  (Currently, I've got an oil pressure gauge, oil temp. and a
fuel/air LED gauge fed from an O2 sensor near #4 on my SS exchanger,
next to go in with be a clyinder head temp gauge...then maybe a vacuum
gauge....hey maybe then an altimeter and an artificial horizon!)

Cheers,
