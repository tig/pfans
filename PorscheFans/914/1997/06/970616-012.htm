So what have you done to the engine so far? How high is the compression?

Just convert your hubs to five lug and get a set of cookie cutter
wheels. You don't need to do the whole suspension change. It'll be
cheaper than getting custom 4-lug wheels made. And yes, they will have
to be custom. And for 15X7 you will wind up paying about $800 or more
for Revolutions/Panasport/DuraLight/Keiser wheels. I would expect the
cookie cutters to be cheaper. But ask the 911 list for those.

The part that rubs on the tire.

Rolled out. As far out as you care to. If this is a trailer riding
kindof car, are you concerned with cosmetics?
