YES, Rich Johnson, makes the best kit around.  And YES, if you are going
to do it yourself, make the door brackes and since you have a cage it may
not be as bad, but the doors on these well closeup if when you weld the
stiffiners in place with out the door braces.  There are pics in the
factory manual, but it is a piece that keeps the door area open to specs.
 Pretty simple but needed, also keep heat to a minium and that should be
about it.

Geee that is a lot of spring.  You need to reinforce the rear shock
towers, with that kind of spring you WILL rip the tops out of the tower.

Take care,
