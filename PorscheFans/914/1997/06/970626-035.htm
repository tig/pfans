Dan and Dave,  thanks for the info.  I hadn't realized the speedo could be
recalibrated that much.    I also have a small steering wheel, being 6'4" I
need it just so my knee can fit between the wheel and shifter.  I'd been
thinking about having the speedo face redone so I could turn it and have
the 30-60+ range visible throught the wheel.  I could go for the 195/60's
as suggested then also havespeedo recalibrated.

Although the point of just figuring out the points on the tach and using
those would be cheaper <grin>. Then I could save money for the combo gauge
(since my knee also blocks my view of the center console :-(

Speaking of the shifter and leg room.  I have a short shift kit I am going
to use.  It is the epoxy type.  Was thinking of rotating the shift lever
slightly to gain more leg room between the wheel and shift lever. Anyone
ever done that? Any problems if I do.  With long arms, reaching it won't be
a problem.

Thanks,
Jeff
