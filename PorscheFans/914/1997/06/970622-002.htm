Hi all -

Posting this for a friend whose car didn't make it to an autocross today 
becuase of some rough running.

Seems that she took it out last night to check and make sure everything 
worked and within about three or four blocks of the house, the engine 
began to run very rough and stalled frequently.  She claims it ran great 
out of the driveway.

My first idea was failed fuel pump, but that would allow the car to 
re-start and run again.  Then I began to think about the head temperature 
sensor.  Maybe it was allowing the car to run full rich and flooding the 
engine.  My Haynes mail is not accessible.  If I remember right, the 
sensor goes to no resistance upon reaching temperature...right?

Dave Darling give me a call when you get this message (408-735-1322) 
since your number isn't in the LPR roster (but your old address is!).
