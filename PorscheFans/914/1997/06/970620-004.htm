Stephen is correct.  Anyone concerned about any particular area of 914
restoration can send us well lighted 35mm pictures of the trouble areas and
15.00. Someone from our restoration department will study the pictures and
then call and discuss the problem, including what a repair shop may charge
to repair, parts needed and availability, as well as shops we may know in
your area to do the work.
