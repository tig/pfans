A question to the list if I may.

I put the engine back into my 914 ('72 1.7L) this weekend.  I replaced
the old motor mounts with new ones purchased from GRP.  The new mounts
are actually mounts for a 911 according  to Dave at GRP.  I used the
same washers above and below the mount as per the original mounts.
Looking into the engine bay, the engine appears to be approximately 1/4
inch below where it was previously.  There is a gap between the new
rubber seal at the back of the engine and the engine cover plate at the
rear.  The mounting bolts are seated properly and torqued to specified
pressure.  The transaxles bolt to the transmission and wheels without
binding and the car drives OK.  

Questions:  Should I have done something different with the motor
mounts?  Should I have not used the  old washers?  Will the air gap at
the engine cover plate rear cause overheating?

Also, thanks to the list member who posted the threaded rod method of
replacing the engine.  I could not get the engine under the car for
lifting with a jack so I used a very low dolly and placed the engine
under the car and then with the threaded rods, worked the engine into
the engine bay.  Without the rod method, my engine would be on the floor
of the garage still!
