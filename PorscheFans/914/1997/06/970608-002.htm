After "fixing" the four broken wires to my MPS three times, I
established that I do indeed have a good connection from the point of
the break to the MPS.  The problem appears much worse, though.  There
are about 20 wires coming out of the computer, and the PO (I'm guessing)
put them into a piece of thick split hose about 2 ft. long, and wrapped
that in electrical tape.  Thus, the wires are visible for about an inch
leaving the computer, then they go into this wrapped tube below the
computer (which is mounted to the fire wall in the engine compartment
just behind the passenger seat) for about 2 ft, which "dumps" them out
by the battery.  They then travel to the various sensors and grounds,
and the four wires to the MPS only travel about 2 ft. to the sensor.
Well, I discovered that while the car is running, I can gently move this
wrapped bundle around (causing the wires at the computer to move) and
cause the car to start missing, backfiring, and nearly die.  So, my best
guess at this point is that when I broke those four wires, I also
loosened at least one of their connections at the computer.  It appears,
however, that taking the computer apart to investigate this theory is
not only risky, but rather difficult.  Is it possible to pull the
computer and its harness without pulling the engine or its tin?  How (if
at all) do I take the computer apart to investigate the connections?  Is
there a better way I should approach this?  I'm getting so frustrated,
I'm tempted to just tow the car to a shop and let them figure it out,
but I know that'll just be a waste of money, because there isn't
anything they can do that I can't.  Any and all advice at this point
would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks again for everyone's help!
