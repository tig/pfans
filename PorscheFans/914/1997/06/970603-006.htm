Yes, you can replace the first speed gear pair by only removing the rear
cover. First speed drive gear has a small roll pin in the castelated nut
that has to be removed. Also, you'll need a special really deep socket
to get the stretch bolt off of the other gear. Both bolts are torqued to
something like 75ft-#, so you'll also need a way to hold the shafts still
while you remove the nut and bolt. If the transmission is still bolted =
to
the engine, you can put it in fifth and possibly use the internal
resistance of the engine to get the fasteners off. Otherwise, I take
the shift rails out and engage two speeds simultaneously to lock
up the transmission. You have to be really careful about the gaskets
between the intermediate plate and the rest of the case because
they set the pinion position relative to the ring gear. Mess that up
and the transmission will be ruined in a short time.
