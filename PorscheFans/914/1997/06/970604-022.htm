There's a reason why you caught hell for it. If you do that on a track,
you stand a good chance of collecting someone else or heading nose first
into a very unforgiving armco.

I never try to catch the wheel untill the car has recovered, I like my
fingers where they are. That's why I call it a hail mary recovery. I've
heard of alot of folks who broke fingers by trying to catch a free wheel
in a spin recovery. That's another reason for getting yelled at.

There are of course, lot's of schools of thought on how to handle the
steering wheel. The one I favor, is picking two points on the wheel, and
always keeping your hands there. If you need to turn more, shift your
hands by 180 increments. That way you have a very good idea of what
straigh ahead is without needing to look at the wheel. This school of
steering also hates the idea of the hail mary recovery. The belief, and
rightly so, is if you take your hands off the wheel and let it spin, and
something unexpected goes wrong (and it will) then you have no idea
where your wheels are pointed when you get your hands back on the wheel.
That's why I never do it unless I feel there's no way to save it, and I
have the runout room. The run is already blown, and it's alot better
than jumping on the brakes and flat spotting my race tires.

But this is just my opinion, and as usual, worth just a little bit less
than what you paid for it...
