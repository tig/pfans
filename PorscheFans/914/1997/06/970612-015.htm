Hey everyone,

First sorry I forgot abou the win.dat file the office mailer sends out.
They say the problem can't be fixed until they upgrade the mail system.



Second I bought an outdoor carcoon. I don't know if you have heard of the=

product. I say it in CLASSIC CAR and found a guy in Canada who sells them=
=2E
The basic idea is it is a bubble for a car. Drive the car onto a ground
sheet. Put the cover over the car and zip it to the ground sheet. Turn on=

the two fans and the carcoon inflates around the car. Here are some
inpressions after a months use. The Car is clean!! The air filters seem t=
o
remove all the dust that goes throught them. The car is dry. I checked
after a heavey T-Storm and now water anywhere in side the carcoon or on t=
he
car. Even in the sun the carcoon stays cool on the inside. It changes the=

air inside the cover every 20 min. =


I think this is a great solution for the garage impaired like me. Anyway =
I
would recommended this to anyone and if you have any questions let me kno=
w.
I have no connections to the sale of carcoons.
