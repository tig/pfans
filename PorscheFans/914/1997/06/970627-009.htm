Nope, just the O-ring. It's the most common leak source for the 901
gearbox, and the O-ring is cheap. The gallon of SWEPCO or AMSOIL isn't
though. That little bolt is all that holds it in place. 

Step 1]	Open the transmission _FILL_ plug first. You want to open teh
fill plug first because if you open the drain plug and drain the tranny
and _then_ discover that teh fill plug is frozen or damaged, you're SOL.

Setp 2] Yeah, drain plug, you guessed it.

Step 3] Revove that little bolt at the end of the tranny. CAREFULLY! It
is a small bole and the threads are cut into magnesium which is not the
sturdiest alloy in the world. It's likely that the O-ring has been
replaced a number of times, and those threads have been getting alot of
stress. The first tranny I did, the hole had already been heli-coiled
and the coil pulled right out with the bolt. So be careful. 

Step 4] Replace the O-ring. It's obvious once you see it.

Step 5] put it all back together and fill 'er up. Again, be careful
tightening that little bolt. The official number is 12-13 lb-ft, but I'd
say just snug is sufficient.

19mm, you can get the tool at any air-cooled VW parts house.
