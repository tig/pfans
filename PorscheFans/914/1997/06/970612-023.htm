	I am getting sick of the weak radio in the car. I guess
that goes with the engine. I pulled the original?  8 track a
couple of years ago, and put a borrowed casette player in it.
I tried not to cut anything, but had to slightly modify  the 
8track face plate to accept   the new radio.  The face plate
takes up a  large part of the dash where there is no vinyl, so
I had to keep it.  I want to upgrade but I don't want to cut.
I called crutchfield, and they said the kick panels will take
5x7 speakers, the dash will take just about any radio, but they
don't make a kit for it.  Has anybody taken this or some other
sane route to better audio?  I'd like to hear about what has 
worked (and what  has not).   Email or list is  ok.
