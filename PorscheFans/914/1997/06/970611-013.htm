	Good description, but I've got a couple of things to add:

	One IMPORTANT difference--use pliers to remove the "spring clips"
before you remove the pad retaining pins.  Each clip goes through a hole
in its associated pin.  I found out that, if you hit the pin REAL hard
with a punch, you can break the clip and push the pin out that way.  Did
we mention that new clips are kinda hard to find?
	Also, I don't think anybody makes rear pads with the right-sized
holes in them.  You will have to use a drill or reamer (I think it's a
5/16" or 3/8") to open up the top hole so the pin will slide through it.

	Aftermarket inner plugs are not uncommon.  Either look into the
hole through the trailing arm with a mirror, or poke your finger in there
to try to figure out what kind of socket/wrench you need.  My 2.0 has the
AutoMashin' (I think) plugs, with 10mm bolts epoxied onto them.  It was
several days of frustration before I figured that out...

	If you don't flush your brakes, eventually the insides of the parts
will rust from water in the fluid.  If the rust is bad enough, you get to
throw out your old calipers (etc.) and buy some nice shiny new ones.  (Did I
ever mention how much I hate the previous owners of my now-sold 1.8?)
