I've been seeing 230F-270F, even 280F (!) on my 914 2.0 that's used for
Time Trialing. That's with a fan-forced oil cooler and about 9 qts of oil
(there's an Accusump, etc.). Naturally, these numbers scare the @&#$ out of
me, especially 'cause I meet other 914 owners who say their racers (carb'd
-- I'm FI'd) are running too cool. I have yet to figure out why this motor
runs so hot.

BUT, after 6 or 7 Time Trial weekends with temperatures like this there
have been no deleterious results -- oil pressure is fine at startup and
when running, and seems quite normal when the oil's at, say, 220 degrees.
I'm using Mobil1 15W-50. I usually shut the engine down after the oil has
cooled to 210F or cooler, and the idle pressure has risen to 20+ psi.

My temps could be an aberration in that they are sensed at the stock 914
pickup point, which gets no cooling at all (it's pre-cooler, 'cause the
cooler is post-pump). These high temps remain a mystery to me ... 

While I'm at it, I'll say that even with the Accusump (and pulling
sustained 1.10+ g's) I can watch the oil pressure start to fall on long
sweepers. So it's not a cure-all, though it does work pretty well. I lost
the previous motor 'cause I missed that ridiculously small green (?!?!) oil
pressure idiot light while on a skidpad. I have a scored, fully
counterweighted crank w/Carillo rods on it to serve as a reminder.

The main thing I've learned from the experience is that a good synthetic
oil laughs at these kinds of temperatures.
