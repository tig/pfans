Hey folks, I need your help again.

As you may know, I finally got all the brakes and suspension finished last
weekend.  

Twice in the four times I've had the car ('75 2.0) out I've had the car
start revving out of control up and down between approx 5500 and 7000+ rpm.
The revving happens between shifts.  Each time, I have turned off the
ignition, waited a few seconds, and restarted the car without problems.

I have also noticed that both cold and warm idle are much higher than last
year, with about 1500 - 1800 at the bottom end, but ranging up to almost
3000 rpm.

I did rebuild the pedals, but I can't find any place where the throttle
cable is sticking.

Does anyone have an idea where I should check?  Might this be just that the
car has sat since last fall?  H E L P!

Thanks as always,
Jeffrey Dunning
