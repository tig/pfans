What can be done for a RR caliper that has a piston extended, but the
device, which should take the 4mm allen or socket is screwed up, so I can't
retract it.
My l/r caliper takes the allen, and works fine.  The RR looks to have been
hammered on or something.  I think it may have taken a 4mm socket to adjust,
originally.

View is difficult through the suspension arm.  We are going to remove the
caliper as soon as we get a good hyd line wrench, and the penetrating oils
set in.  Are they really rebuildable by amateurs?  I would rather spend and
live, then save and die, and it is my 16 yr old son's car, so ...

Invite comments on rebuilding, also should I do both LR & RR?

Invite offers of used.  Invite comments on repair of adjustment mechanism,
bearing in mind that the piston may be stuck anyway.

Thanks for the help.  Car is now Out Of Service.  Son requests use of my
Cars, daily, so I am interested in getting his back on road.  Besides, he
looks good in it!
