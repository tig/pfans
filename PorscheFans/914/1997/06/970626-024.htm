It's funny - the hose layout in the haynes manual shows both dist.
vaccumm lines connecting to the same point on the throttle.  BTW,
my distributor is a '70 1.7 so it may be different.

Since I'm just getting confused - shouldn't both need to see manifold
vaccumm to function properly?  I'm probably going to pop the 
distributor cap and do some sucking on the hoses to see which moves
the plate toward advance and which toward retard - nothing is better
than heuristic evidence.

But if they both see manifold vacuum, won't they cancel each other out?

Oh boy - someone please shoot me now......
