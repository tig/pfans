I managed to dig up this side bar article published in Car & Driver Magazine 
of April 1988.  This article accompanied a test drive comparison titled "Gee 
Force" which consisted of the '88 Toyota MR2, '88 Pontiac Fiero Formula, and 
the '88 Honda Civic Si.  It's nice to own and drive a piece of automotive 
history that was the blueprint of cars to come.  I present to all of the 914 
faithful that very article giving Car & Driver Magazine full credit for all 
that is to follow.  - Craig Z.


"Porsche's Precursor"
'The 914 revisited' 
by Rich Ceppos
Car & Driver Magazine, April 1988, pg. 45

  . The bumpy road of automotive development is littered with rusted-out 
ideas that contributed little or nothing to where we are today.  Every now 
and then, though, you come upon a gleaming machine that pointed the way to 
the future and stuck around long enough to make a difference.  The Porsche 
914 is such a car.
  The 914 was introduced here in 1970.  Though no one knew it then, the 
lightweight, mid-engined two-seater was something of a blueprint.  The Fiat 
X1/9 was a low-cost 914 clone.  Today's Fiero and MR2 are direct descendants.
  Even the front-engined CRX has spiritual ties to the little Porsche.
In 1970, no one dreamed that we'd ever regard the 914 warmly.  Its 76-hp, 1.
7-liter, air-cooled engine was puny next to the seven-liter ground pounders 
of the muscle-car era.  Its handling was quirky.  And it proved that even 
little Porsches could be expensive.
  But times change.  The 914 got better, criticism mellowed, and sales 
climbed.  The 914 hung around until 1976, when the 924 appeared, the first 
Porsche with a front engine and water cooling.  Today, we know that the 914 
was the right car at the wrong time.  It resembles the Gee Force cars more 
than the Japanese and English sports cars of its day.
  All of this encouraged us to take a ride around the block in a 914 in 
hopes of gauging our progress.  Luckily, digging up a well-preserved sample 
was as easy as walking to the parking lot.  Andre' Idzikowski, our 
Bondurant-trained road warrior, owns a lovingly refurbished 1973 914, a 2.
0-liter model.  He bought it a couple of years back from Csaba Csere, who 
had left it to oxidize when he moved up to a 911 in 1979.
  Since taking ownership, Andre' has repaired a rusty rocker panel, replaced 
a rotted door, fitted a set of Goodrich 185/70 Euro T/As, and spruced up his 
914 as much as he could on an engineering students budget.  It looks great.  
Andre' gets extra points for not flinching when we asked for the keys.
In some ways Andre's 914 doesn't feel fifteen years old. It's body is tight 
for an opened-topped car with 96,000 miles - though it's a little hard to 
tell, because the back window rattles loudly. Its steering is light and 
direct, but its ride is choppy. Most impressive is its 2222 pound curb 
weight. With so little to motivate, the never-overhauled 91-hp engine has 
enough oomph to power the 914 to 60 mph in just 8.6 seconds.
Still, there is no mistaking this car for a new design. The arms-out driving 
position is awkward, the seats are short on support and have fixed seat 
backs, and the heater is a joke. In our original 914 road test, Patrick 
Bedard wrote that the flat four-cylinder sounded like "a miniature 
sheetmetal-stamping plant." No argument there. At least it packages well. 
That, along with the space-saving front suspension, endows the 914 with 
about twice the usable trunk space of the MR2 or the Fiero.
But enough seriousness. Andre' says what he like best about his 914 is that 
"it's great for zipping around in on a warm day with the top off." And. of 
course, that it's a Porsche.    -RC
