Kevin,
If you're concerned about the cost issue of a convertible top
modification, why not try the honda civic del sol route; power rear
window.  Many times I've thought of doing this to my car using the
mechanicals out of an old bronco or blazer tailgate (electric lift).

The custom guys you mention could probably do it *relatively* cheap.  It
would be like a convertible, but with a "rollbar".

Just another suggestion...
