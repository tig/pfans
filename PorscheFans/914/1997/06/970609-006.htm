Walker,

There is a circlip which holds the "star" (the inner portion of the
joint) to the halfshaft.  Once you get the off (which is a minor PITA),
you'll still need to press/drive off the star portion.  Same thing for
the outboard end.  You know that you might have to do a bit of prying
to get the joint loose from the stub axle due to the gasket and roll
pins, right?  Oh, and I think it's a 27mm (maybe 30mm?) socket to
get off the stub axle nut.  That, and a *long* breaker bar (helps
to have the car in gear and the parking brake on, btw.).
