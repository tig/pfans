Hi Craig.

Re:

I'd be interested in "main ECU harnesses" for '74 2.0's (I have 2).

I'd also be interested in all the harnesses that plug into the relay board,
but they're not as important as that main ECU harness.

NOTE: I would only buy such a harness if it were made with multi-stranded
teflon-coated (.006" is typical/adequate)  wire.  The stuff is not horribly
expensive. 22ga. 19/34 wire (19 strands of 34ga. wire -- too small for this
application) costs $70-$90/1000', it will truly last FOREVER, being totally
unaffected by heat and moisture, it remains flexible, etc. 

I have a 16ga yellow .015"-teflon-coated wire that has been sitting on a
(non-Porsche) exhaust manifold for the past 6 years (it's connected to an
O2 sensor that I added) and it's still as good as new. Teflon-coated wire
is AWESOME! If you need info I can put you in touch w/suppliers.

OK, I'll calm down now ... ;-)
