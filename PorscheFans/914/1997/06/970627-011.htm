Hey 914 Nuts,

Thanks guys for the personal responses.

I don't know why I can't get through, when I can get onto all the other
services I access.  Oh well.  At least I haven't lost touch with the main
914 nuts.  I have the seperate addresses archived so I can go find 'em if
I need them anyway.

Just thought I'd let you know."

Thanks Dave.  Not a prob.  Juno doesn't let you use aliases, nick names
or screen names.  The original issue was whether I was going to be
directly quoted on that piece I wrote on PTFE.  Even though it sprang
from a discussion about the use / manipulation of Teflon bushings in
suspension mods, it could have been misconstrued as coming from my
organization as an endorsement (or the opposite), which I can NOT be part
of officially, in my position.  I don't care if folks utilize my real
name as opposed to my screen / nick name.  There are alot of Jeff's out
there but very few Jebby's, and that's an affectionate name my maternal
grandfather (inventor / tinkerer / engineer - like me) called me.  Thanks
for the concern Dave.

BTW - in our industry, oil change frequency is a hot topic these days,
and it is HIGHLY misunderstood by MOST people (especially including
practitioners).  I wrote a brochure to SIMPLY explain the points,
representing our association, and the industry at large.  It's entitled,
"Why Change Motor Oil".  The crux of the issue is the definition of
"Normal" versus "Severe" service, in owner's manuals.  It goes on sale
next Tuesday, $10 for 25 booklets.  Credit card orders can be placed at
800.331.0329.  Maybe not so obviously, but the association is on line at:

aoca@onramp.net
and we have a web page at:

http://www.aoca.org

All that, just in case you're curious what I do for gainful employment.
