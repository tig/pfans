Scot Douglas was kind enough to help me toss the engine back 
into my car on Saturday and everything went beautifully until...

It was time to reattach the 1/2 shafts and I found a round
bearing in the baggie I'd used to cover the left one.  I swear,
show it to Scot and he says, "Wait...", runs to engine bay, 
reaches in and exclaims, "thats what this thing was...", holding
up yet another CV bearing.  Cripes.

Time to dive into the grease-pit under the boot.  We pulled the
CV to rebuild it (damn me for not tying them in tigher) and 
learned all about how to do it in the procees.  Scot was actually
the one who figured how to twist at just the right angle to get
it back together...

Now, I've got it back together, minus some of the grease, plus
had to use a little brake cleaner to get at the c-clip.  So, 
what do I do?  I know the dangers of mixing two different types
of grease, I know I should pull the damn things off and soak
them in solvent, re-lube with molygrease and re-install.  But 
will someone come to my rescue and help me ease my conscience
by stating that I can just slap some new grease in there and
be on my way?

Need recommended solvent for soaking the grease out of the CVs
and the best way to re-pack them.  So much grease, so little
time...

Regards,
