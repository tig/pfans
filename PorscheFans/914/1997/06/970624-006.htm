Actually, it might be. Mike, Sacramento is much cheaper than San
Francisco for insurance. And Miami I was hazzard a guess is a more
expensive area. In Palo Alto, CA I was paying $1300/yr for full coverage
and low deductables on just the 914. Here in Boulder, CO I'm paying
$1200/yr for full coverage and low deductables for BOTH of my cars
total. Where you live has alot to do with how much you pay. Plus, if you
have any accidents or tickets the cost will rise accordingly.

That is a very subjective question. How much money are you _willing_ to
spend? How much do you enjoy the car? How bad off is the car to begin
with? If the car is rusted out and falling apart, then it's really hard
to say that it's worth while. If on the other hand, the chassis is
straight and the rust is minimal, then the only real limit will be how
much you _want_ to spend. Do you want a basic fun car and cosmetics are
not terribly important? Or do want to make a concourse car?
