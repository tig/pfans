hmm,  makes me think of oil cooler seals or the cooler itself.  The seals
are replaceable with the engine in the car, but it's a 1 hr job.  

1.  remove filter
2.  undo the 3 nuts (10mm) that hold the cooler in place.  they're hard to
reach, and it takes a while.
3.  slide cooler towards front of car as far as you can 1/2-3/4" or so
4.  remove old seals
5.  put new seals in place :)   I used a dab of grease and a long skinny
screwdriver to hold the seals like a lollipop and stick them up in place on
the cooler itself.  this takes a few tries.  do the upper seal first.  a
bright light usually helps a lot too.  You can try wheel bearing grease, or
white grease and a suitably bent coat hanger--straight, except for a 1/4"
90 degree bend right at the end.
6.  put cooler back, re-install washers and nuts, replace (or re-install)
filter, check oil level

I think I remember seeing oil galley plugs on the front of the engine, but
when they work loose, you usually get big gushes, not just a fast drip.  I
also don't think the front seal gets much pressure.
