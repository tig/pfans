During my "Early Days" as an engineer at a dynamometer test facility, I
wrote endurance tests for "Big Three" powertrains.c  Keep in mind these
engines were watercooled...but controlling oil temp to 270 deg F was
commonplace.  During this oil temp we ran RPM as high as 7500, 100%
load.  Oil was changed every 90 test hours; we never had an oil-related
failure (Unless it escaped after a connecting rod through a hole in the
crankcase!).

Just 2 cents more...
