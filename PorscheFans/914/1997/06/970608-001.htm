914ers,

I need to adjust the ride hieght of my front end.  I have a small problem
though, the adjusting screws are the early allen head style bolts, and both
of them are cracked.  Thus, I can't turn a wrench to get them to go up or
down.  I've got a small air-powered cutoff wheel I'm going to use to cut
the bolts and get the torsion bar caps off with, but I'm curious about
something.  What is the best way to raise the front end to accomplish this
job?  I've got a brand new set of ramps I'd like to use, but maybe I should
lift the wheels off of the ground the old fashioned way and let them hang.

What is the best correct way of pulling this off?  Oh, and any suggestions
on how to get the caps?

As always, thanks for the advice.

Dion
