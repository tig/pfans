914-6 conversion project
Due to unusual circumstances I must sell
my 914-6 conversion project. I would prefer to
sell as a package at this point rather than
parts. It comes with the following:

71 914 car, current tags and clear title
in my name, never hit, rust in battery tray
but have new tray and support for repair.
Also some rust on engine shelf, but not on
suspension console or clamshells. Some small
door dings, otherwise a solid chassis.

72 2.4l 911t engine. Recent overhaul with
the following updates Time-Cert case, Carrera tensioners,
930 lower valve covers, brand new Permatune
CD box, braided stainless plug wires, Weber
40ida-3c carbs with factory air cleaner box.
Engine has been stipped to bare block and
all tin powdercoated, all new stainless or
cad-plated fasteners used everywhere. New
flywheel,pressure plate,disc,T/O bearing.

911 front suspension: struts,hubs,rotors,
M calipers,new pads, new bearings, strut inserts.
911 master cyl

pedal assy overhauled with Welt bushings.

nice set of 4 16x6 Fuchs alloys (factory not
repro's) + stock 914 alloys car is currently
rolling on.

Factory 914-6 sheet metal, powdercoated.
Factory NEW 914-6 oil tank,filter console,
filler neck assy.
Rich Johnson's chassis stiffening kit
factory 914-6 gauges, concourse center console
with gauges.

Lots of other parts, manuals, books, factory microfiche

Car chassis has been prepared for stripping
and painting, with all parts replaced or
restored as they were removed, organized
and stored in sealed bags ready to reinstall
after painting. A nice project, with most
parts needed to complete. I have receipts
for slightly more than $8000, asking $5000
or best offer. Take note, those of you contemplating
a -6 conversion, here's an easy way to get a jump
on it and save some big bucks. email or call
for more details 503 613-8958 mfredett@ptdcs2.intel.com
