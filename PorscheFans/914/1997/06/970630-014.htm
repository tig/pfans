O.K., I need a little advice here.  I've got a friend that owns a '76
914 2.0.  The car has been sitting for the last 5 years (he's terribly
lazy), so he pulled the motor to give the top end a once-over (the P.O.
supposedly rebuilt the whole engine just before he bought it).  The
cylinders were badly rusted, and were already .020 over, so he couldn't
go any further.  He says he can't afford to buy new pistons and
cylinders, so the car has been sitting in the apartment parking lot
without an engine (that's on the floor in his apartment) for the last 6
months.  Well, the landlord is sick of it, and is going to tow it
tomorrow unless he moves it.  So, my friend is thinking about selling it
to a junk yard...  I simply cannot comprehend this at all.  He bought
the car for $1800, equipped with 44mm dual Delartos.  He scrapped the
Delartos, and bought some Webbers ($250), a new exhaust ($100), and a
few other parts like tail lens and replacement turn-signal lenses
(~$200).  The junk yard will give him about $200 for the whole thing.
Now, logic would dictate that this is a pretty bad deal, and I hope its
as obvious to you as it is to me that my friend is not all that bright.
The car is suffering from some pretty bad rocker and battery tray rust,
but nothing that would warrant trashing the whole car.  I can't seem to
get it through to him that if he'd just get himself a garage and cough
up $500 for the P&Cs that he could have the car running again (another
friend of ours cleaned up his heads for $50 - they're in good shape).
So, how do I prevent yet another 914 tragedy in this situation?

Thanks,
