Mike:

Thanks for the update on Parade.   Did you know Jason Burkett got 1st in
his class for the autocross - driving 944 TurboS? (He is building a 914-6
out of his 2.0L)  George Sargent of Houston also got first place in his 944
class.    I hope you did equally well in your race.  (Although that will be
tough with just carbs in I1!.)

Nice plug for the Lone Star Regions Club Race.   I was one of the race
committee members and racer in Group 3 driving my 74 914 2.0L.  I got third
behind a REALLY fast Jon Lowe of AL and Pat Steiger - my mentor and
nemesis.   We had sunny and hot weather.  Dry the whole weekend.   There
were approximately 70 cars and lots of Parade visitors there to watch.

Next year we are hoping to do it early in the spring instead.   It sure was
something to watch that Norwood car lose the drivers front tire right as
the green flag dropped.   I kept telling my son to watch the car "because
it was going to spin out in turn three."   I couldn't believe it made it
back to the pits!!!   Actually,  they had problems all weekend.

I second your opinion about Paragon Products.  Great guys.  Great Prices.
Great Knowledge.
