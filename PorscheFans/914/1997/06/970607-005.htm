RE my question: . . . factory tapped hole for a cylinder head temp sensor in
> 2.0 heads (if there is, please describe where it is . . . 

Thanks to all who provided clues.  I was first led astray by a sketch that 
came with the sensor showing where you drill a hole through the side of the 
head right above the bail pivot that holds the rocker arm cover on.  Turns out 
that sketch was for a Type I VW.

The next glimmer of hope was when one of you reminded me to check the pictures 
in Haynes.  That reminded me of the hole in the cooling sheet metal I had to 
seal over, so I took off the passenger side (3&4) tin to find a flat boss just 
forward of the rear sparkplug.  Then I remembered that some said it was on the 
drivers' side head, so I took that tin of and VOILA there the tapped hole was, 
just to the rear of the forward sparkplug.  Turns out that the shop that did 
my valves/rings put the right head on the left side and vice versa.

Thanks to all of you, it really took several replies for me to piece together 
this puzzle!
