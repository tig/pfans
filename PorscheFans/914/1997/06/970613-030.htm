914ers,

In my quest to get this fine piece of German engineering back on the road,
I'm finally to the stage of driving it around the block, working out bugs,
etc.  Many of you have helped me get to this stage, and once again I thank
you.

The latest problem is two-fold.  I don't know how much one is affecting the
other, probably not much, but it's hard to get one right with the other
wrong.  

Problem #1:  Let me start with the clutch first.  The current clutch in the
car is fairly new and in good condition.  I rebuilt the pedal assembly and
put in a new cable.  I took it out for its' first drive around the block
today, and the first thing I noticed was the clutch 'grabbing' when I was
in first or reverse.  By this I mean bucking badly and jerking till I
either popped into another gear or depressed the clutch pedal back in.  Per
the manuals I have, I checked the tranny and engine mounts for looseness,
but everything is good and tight.  I'm not sure if the clutch cable is
adjusted correctly or not.  What is the correct procedure for this?  How
much tension should be on the cable back at the tranny end?  It shifts fine
going into second, third, fourth, etc. To lend to the issue, I also noticed
the clutch tube being loose, at both ands.  Not a good sign, but I jambed a
small block of wood into the tunnel just ahead of the shifter to hold the
tube tight until I can get it welded.

Problem #2: I can't seem to get the shifter adjusted properly.  It is
connected to the shifting arm exactly where it is supposed to be
(side-shifter) and is connected properly at the mid-point joint near the
firewall.  The first problem I had was not being able to get it into fourth
or fifth.  I took the shifter out, positioned the shift rod (tranny end)
into fifth, and reinstalled the shifter.  Now I'm having trouble getting
into first and reverse.  I can eventually get it into gear after hunting
for a while.  The bushings are not the best in the world, as a matter of
fact, most on this list would probably say they are bad.  How much is this
lending to my adjustment frustration?  Anyone got a new set of bushings for
a side-shifter?

Sorry this is so long, but I can see the light at the end of the tunnel and
it doesn't seem to be getting any closer at this point.  I'm already going
to miss this Sunday's autocross.  Guess I'll have to drive the good old
Neon ACR again and wup some 924's   :).

Thanks for the help,

Dion
