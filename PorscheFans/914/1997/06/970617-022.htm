 Hey Stephen, 

 I really want to get it welded on, but every time I get the money to do
it, another one of those "I just gota have it" parts comes along. I
think I will just wait till I have the    GT flares welded on, and have
it all done at once...Ouch!

Guess it depends on the car...hahaha

 And they used the door braces.  Maybe with

I dont understand ?? if the car is on the lift and lifted by the jack
points, and no motor, would the back end really sag ??
Since the front and rears arent be tied together, is there a problem ??
I didnt think there was that much heat, or is that even the problem ??
What Im tring to say is if the rear end did sag and your welding piece's
onto the chassie, but none of the piece's are tied together, how could
it warp the door area that much so far away ???
 Now that where all confused........
