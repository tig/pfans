Ha, no can do man. Just for everyone's info, I lost a coupleof privlidges 
to become a patent office employee, one of which was the ability to apply 
for a patent (another was the right to strike).

But, that reminds me - I had a really big shazam yesterday. You know those
magnetic mats they stick on the doors of cars to advertise various things
(they kindof feel like mouse pads)? Well, what if someone made some fender
protectors out of that material? You know, those things people typically
drap over the fender of a front engine car to protect the fender (then rub
the thing against the fender with thier thighs and scratch the paint
anyway)? What if we had some cut to the shape of a quarter panel so we
wouldn't get krud on it when we're working on the rear wheel area? 
Magnetic fender protectors - what a concept. I know that they make the 
regular kind with embedded magnets, but this would be made of the 
magentic material instead. You could even put some really strong magnets 
on it to hold tools and fasteners.

Gee thanks, I hope someone actually is successful in using the thing.
