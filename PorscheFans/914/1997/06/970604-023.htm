Yup! Welcome to the gang! :)

Faster? Not a whole lot. The 2.0 has about a 15hp advantage over the
1.7. The low end torque is more the reason why the 2.0 is prefered over
the 1.7. Top speed, and the time it takes to get there are not going to
change that radically from a 1.7 to a 2.0.

Yes, but few if any are running them on the street. These are almost
always race built engines, and require special care and feeding to make
them last.

From the line? Forget it. The 914 was never intended as a muscle car/
But on a twisty mountain road, race track, or autocross course, the 914
will shine. The 914 was designed and built to handle better than
anything else even close to its price range. And it exceeds those goals
admirably. Yes, they can make use of alot more power than the factory
originally equiped them with, but it takes money. Sometimes alot of it.

I'm very sceptical of those claims. There's a reason why the stock FI
can't handle agressive cams, and it's not the brain. The D-jet FI works
off of the manifold pressure (vacuum) and agressive cams can confuse the
pressure sensor. If the SDS is just a replacement brain and nothing
else, I'd stay away.

Secondly, programable FI systems are great things for tuning the car to
its best. BUT, it takes a lot of time with a laptop and you may not have
the system dialed in for a long time. I know of people that have taken
years to perfect their programable systems.

If it's big power you're looking for, do a transplant. In the long run
it'll be more reliable and lower maintenance than a big thumper 4 cyl
with a trick FI. Unless you want to build your car for a specific
competition class, then do whatever it takes to make your critter the
fastest critter in the pack, if you've got the money of course.
