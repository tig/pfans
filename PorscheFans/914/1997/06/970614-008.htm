A week ago I contacted AA about the kit I bought several years ago and just
recently decided to install. My problem was that only three of the fourteen
hoses in the kit fit. The diagram from George only labled one hose with the
inside diameter. I have been referred to Dave Darlings hose diagram but it is
of a 2.0 engine. Does anyone have either a diagram with the correct lengths
and dimensions, or just a description of which diameter hose goes to what
device. 

I checked Automotion and others and they really don't list all of the hoses
that George sent me. 

Also: the Haynes manual only shows a pressure regulator on the passenger side
of the compartment and the catalogs only show a fuel pressure regulator and
an auxilary air regulator. My car has a regulator with 3.5 hoses located on
the passenger side of the engine to a "T" that connects to the plenum, and
the fuel pressure regulator which is located below the air cleaner box. Other
lines from the passenger side of the regulator are larger than 3.5 and also
go to the plenum and the  a plastic "T" that goes to the plastic air
connection between the air meter and the throttle valve. I see two hoses
running from the auxilary air regulator. Unfortunately none of the hose in
the kit fit either this valve, the hose running from the oil cap is the wrong
diameter and only one vent hose is the right length to reach the charcoal
canister. (From air box to canister) The hose of the right diameter that
should run from the blower casing to the canister is way to short as is the
3.5 that runs from the "T" to the fuel pressure regulator.

I would appreciate any help. The car runs fine, I just want to replace 23 old
hoses
