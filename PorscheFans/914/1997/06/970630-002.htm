Thanks, I will check this also.  Looking at the throttle body and the
throtlle cable linkage, I was somewhat confused over the 2 springsand their
functions.  The long return spring seems self-explanatory.  However, the
larger diameter spring that is on the linkage shaft doesn't have any
apparent use as the 2 partss of the linkage appear independant of eah other.
Thus the spring doesn't serve any purpose.

Any hints?

Thanks,
Jeff Dunning
