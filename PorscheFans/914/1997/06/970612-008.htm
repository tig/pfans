Hi Josh,

The got tons of them. Call Totally Stainless 717-337-2151. They are M8 =
set
screws with a nice 4mm hex socket in the end, I dont' recall the proper =
length,
so if you have a spare stud handy, measure the length and call them. I =
do recall
that they stick out of the head by about 40mm, so maybe 50mm is the right=
 length.
They are cheap. These people are real wrench turners, too. You might get =
lucky and

one of owners might answer the phone. They are really cool people. Thier =

catalog has a bunch of cute graphics with one that I particularly like =
of a guy
busting his knuckles on a frozen and rusted fastener. They got into the =
business
because they got frustrated with dealing with frozen nuts on thier own =

restoration projects.

Oh yeah, you know
those 6mm cheese head machine screws that are used to hold your engine
tin together and are by now "bonded as one" with either your engine or =
the
tin? Well, they have them in ss and in stock for cheap!! I had to use an =
impact
to get mine apart last time. No More!!

A word of caution: These fasteners are only about Grade 4 or so, so they
cannot be used in any high strength application. Exhaust nuts are only =

torqued to 15ft-lb so that would be a good application for ss. Totally
Stainless knows all about this, too.

About galling: Galling can easily be avoided by the use of anti-seize.
Totally Stainless sells a brand they recommend and they even include
a chart in the back of the catalog on the maximum recommended
torque for ss fasterners of various sizes. They also have a little
discussion about reducing the amount of torque applied as a result
of the use of anti-seize. Anti-seize is basically an EP lubricant so a =

reduction in applied torque of about 25% will achieve the same clamping =

force as the rated torque without anti-seize.
