For J.J. Slowik and other interested parties:

  I have been following the thread on J.J.'s D-Jet wiring problems, and would like to insert my $.02.

   Andrew Warren has been offering good advice, but it seems to me (on the sidelines) that it is not 
being quite properly understood.    Permit me to amplify:

  The cover that Andy is referring to is a gray plastic cover over the END of the box that contains the 
computer.  This cover, as he mentioned, can be removed by sliding it in the direction of the cable 
clamp after the clamp has been undone.  
  Once this cover has been removed, it will be observed that the cable connects to the lower of the 
two PC boards by means of a card edge connector with 25 pins.  This is a large white nylon 
assembly that pretty well fills the hole on the end of the box after the plastic cover is removed.  It is 
equipped with a strap to facilitate removal, but the strap is often broken, as they become brittle with 
age.  No matter, the connector can be fairly easily removed by pulling on the cable itself, together 
with some judicious use of needle-nose pliers on the opposite side of the connector from where the 
wire bundle enters.  The connector pulls straight off, and is located by two rails, one on each end.  Be 
sure to line up these rails with the grooves on the sides of the connector when re-installing it.

  The computer is NOT water tight; it should be mounted with the cable clamp DOWN.  If this 
precaution is observed, then there should be no worry about water ingress; there was never any 
sealing done by the factory on this end cover.  

  DO NOT attempt to remove the metal cover on the box.  As they say on the back of TV's, there are 
"No User Servicable Parts Inside".  Removing the metal cover will likely interfere with it's weather 
tightness, there is a risk of breaking off one or more of the bendable metal tabs that hold the cover 
on, and there is no point to it... all that you need to do, can be done through the connector access 
opening.

  It will NOT be possible to do this, PERIOD!  The connector that you have removed from the 
computer is designed to have crimp-on spring-type connector pins inserted into the nylon body, one 
for each edge foil on the main PC board.  The harness was assembled at the factory by cutting the 
wires to length on a "harness board", installing all the protective sleeving to bundle the thing 
together, and then installing the crimp-on pins on both ends of each wire with special crimp tools.  
(The crimp-on pins are different on the computer end than they are on the engine end.)   Lastly, the 
crimped-on pins are inserted into the nylon "shells", or connector bodies.  To replace the wires, you 
would have to have all the special pins, and their associated crimp tools,  before you even started.  
The only other way to do it is to retain the original crimped ends, and splice new wires on a short 
distance from each connector.  This is 50 splices, 25 on the computer end, and 25 on the engine end. 
 These splices would have to be well made, with clean wire, preferably with solder and shrink tube, 
and would have to be staggered in their locations to avoid bulging the harness to unmanageable 
proportions in the splice area.  In addition, if a wire is actually broken inside the insulation, then 9 
times out of 10, it will break close to the connector, meaning that you will probably splice the problem 
right back into your new wires.  Neither approach is practical.

  Fortunately, replacing the wires is probably not necessary, either.  I have looked at two different 914 
FI wiring harnesses now, and I have found them to be in amazingly good shape on the inside.  Most 
problems are at the ends, where the crimp pins are.  Here is how to go about correcting most 
harness troubles:   
  First, if there are any defective connectors on the engine end, they will most likely have to be 
replaced, by the expedient of splicing.  Fortunately, most of the connectors (the Injector connectors 
for sure) are available with short pigtails to enable this approach.  
  Second, if there is difficulty on the computer end (as your message relates), then the easiest fix is to 
remove the connector from the board and drown the connector in contact cleaner.  Cramoline or 
DE-OX-IT are best, but Radio Shack TV Tuner Cleaner is an acceptable substitute.  Procure a 
pencil type rubber eraser (the kind that is sharpened like a pencil, leaving a protruding pointed 
rubber tip) and employ this to scrub the gold edge foils on the computer board, top and bottom.  
Don't over-do it; the gold is a very thin plating.  Do NOT use a typewriter eraser; they are too 
abrasive.  Use one of the soft pink rubber types.  Once you have scrubbed all the edge foils, hold 
the computer so that the connector access opening is down and spray the board edge connector 
with contact cleaner.  Be sure that no flakes of rubber remain behind.  Lastly, examine the crimp pins 
in the cable edge connector.  They should have a slight curvature to the outermost end, and all 
should look alike, with none bent over, or missing one side, or mashed flat.  They are very well 
protected in the connector shell, and should be all right; if not, sometimes a bit of work with a straight 
pin or jeweler's screwdriver can restore their shape, but BE CAREFUL!  They are easily broken; use 
only the most gentle of force, and then ONLY if the pin is noticibly deformed as compared to the 
other pins.

  Lastly, install and remove the connector onto the computer several times.  An additional spray of 
contact cleaner into the cable connector in the middle of these insertions and removals wouldn't hurt. 
 This will perform the final "scrubbing" of the contacts, and should leave them making excellent 
contact.

   Also, in your case, J.J., I would loose that "hose" that is around the harness; it is nowhere near 
flexible enough and will concentrate the bending moments just where you don't want them: at the 
point where the harness enters the computer case.   Go to your FLAPS and get some of that split 
corrugated tubing that is expressly designed for wire bundles, or some spiral wrap.  Replace the 
hose with one of the above to get your flexibility back.  

  Then perform your check (where you wiggle the harness with the engine running) again, and see if 
your problem persists.  My bet is that it will be gone.

                                                  Good Luck,
                                                  Jim T.
