First things first get Bruce Anderson's book - Porsche 911 Performance
handbook.  First thing I remembered is the brake system is a signal
master cylinder, in 68 Porsche changed to a dual master cylinder design. 
If it is an "S" version the 67 came with vented rear rotors.  The rest
should be bolt on.  Just get a 19mm master cylinder off a 911 after 68,
Otto's sells them for $100.00.  I would swap out everything from the
A-arms and struts.  I would leave the cross bar and rack, unless yours
are toast.  There is no gain since the early 911s had steel crossbars and
the racks are the same.  The A-arms and adjusters should bolt right on,
and you gain more torsion bar sizes than with your 914-4 units.  19mm
bars may be in the car "they were stock" which makes a nice upgrade to
the 17.? front bars on a 914-4.

Get Bruce's Book it will answer all these questions and more!!!!!  I
could go into a chapter of this stuff. but Bruce already did it.  As with
anything Porsche, upgrades are made every year to try ad make a better
product, so the newer (to some degree) 911 you get as a donor the better.
 To some degree because larger engines can cause their own set of
problems.  But you should be able to find that debate about a month ago
on the 914 achieves.  HTTP://www.porschefans.com go down to the achieves
link, don't know if the search function is up and running yet, but if it
is, do a search.

>the engine??
>>    or the year of engine???

Again Bruce's book answers this question.

>>               Starting a major project----

Yes a major project,  things to remember, I know from personnel
experience, this can take several years to complete, and deep pockets. 
First do your research, get all the info you can, about the swap.  Read
everything you can find on the swap before you turn a nut or by anything.
 Lay it down on paper or computer, add everything up and then take on a
over budget figure, I use 30%, but 50% may be a better number.  Also
document all your work, because if you walk into a parts house 10 years
down the road and say I got a 1971 914 and I need brake pads, and you
have SC front calipers and Ferrari 308 rear calipers, you will get the
wrong pads.  And then it is another trip down to the parts store and
possibly several.  Same thing with all the other parts, stereo equipment,
and electronics, keep all the instruction manuals, diskettes, nd the
like.  And pictures are always helpful.  One thing that helps me keep
ahead of a project is to keep the changes simple nd the car on the road
as much as possible.  You can swap the suspension and brakes out in a
weekend, if you gather all the parts before hand and do all the prep work
before you put it on the car.  Advantage is you get to drive the car
which helps you enjoy the car more, and the changes are better
appreciated.  I simple item like changing a seat, or wheels, can enhance
your experience and you still get to use the car.  You can do allot of
the 6 conversion in stages, and still enjoy each one of the changes. 
Think of it as a 10 course meal, each items builds on the other to make
the whole meal an experience hopefully to remember, to the end.

My car is a tub right now and the only enjoyment I get is driving other
peoples 914s not a bad thing, but not ideal.  So I am following my advice
as soon as the rust repairs and stiffing kit are welded on and that
section painted.  My car is going out onto the road with a 1.8L four
banger.  And then I will start upgrading each component at  a time. 
Suspension, brakes, tires and wheels, interior and then finally the
engine.

Good luck, and take care.
