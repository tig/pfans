	I'm really, really glad that Dirk Bergstrom was unable to get
to the Time Trial at Laguna Seca this weekend.  Ya see, I had volun-
teered to be a corner worker on Sunday for him, and when he cancelled,
I didn't have to go...
	One reason I'm glad was because of the BBQ at a friend's house,
where I spent several hours trying not to stare *too* obviously at
several very pretty women.
	Another was that I finally got around to doing some work on
the 914 that I've been meaning to get to for a while...

	The "more blue goo on the brake pads" seems to have worked; the
brakes didn't squeal once on the way to work this morning.  I hope that
they stay quiet, now.
	Question:  What happens if the cover plug for one of the rear
brake adjustment screws is missing?  What about if the screw itself is
gone?  I'm not exactly sure that the screw was gone (there wasn't any
leakage) but I couldn't get my Allen wrench onto/into it, and I couldn't
see the plug using my mirror...

	The rear sway-bar re-install went relatively smoothly, but I
decided that you do need to remove the muffler hanger for clearance.  It
would also have been a lot easier with two floor jacks, one to jack up
each rear wheel to line up the swaybar.  I wound up using a jack-stand,
but it required more fiddling.

	Finally, I had noticed that my car didn't like to get out of 5th
gear, that it lurched a little coming off the line at stoplights, and
that the gearshift lever moved a lot under hard braking or when hitting
the rev-limiter.  Classic "motor/tranny mounts broken" symptoms.  I had
already looked at the tranny mounts, which seemed fine, so I was going to
check the motor mounts.
	What I found was that the mounts were fine.  However, each of the
brackets that connect the rubber mounts to the engine block were loose.
In fact, the right side one only had one of two bolts still in it, and
the other bolt was about 3/4 backed out!  The threads were totally man-
gled.  Yech!  So I went back in and replaced the bolts, and leaned on the
wrench when I put it all back together.  Yes, you can do the motor mounts
with the engine in the car.  Yes, it's a real pain.  I'm afraid I didn't
quite do the job right, though--I forgot to use lock-washers to ensure
that this never happens again.  I was also unable to get one of the nuts
that holds the rubber mount onto the bracket more than finger-tight; I
just could not get the socket to seat on it.  So I'm gonna have to watch
for the symptoms again, and if anything happens, I'll take it all apart
and do it *right*.
	Sigh.

	So I'm not happy for Dirk's sake for missing the Time Trial, but
I'm really very glad that I got the time to do some serious work on the
car.  It needed it.  It could have been very bad to lose the mounts on
the highway, y'know?
