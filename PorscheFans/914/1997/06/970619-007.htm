Sounds like quite a few of you guys are experienced with Brad's kits!
I talked to him a month or so ago while researching before purchase.
I think he has 2 versions, with one made of heavier gauge steel than
the other.  Which one have you guys used, and how did you find the fit?
(I assume his reinforcements are to be welded over the existing rockers,
rather than cutout the old ones first and then weld his in; pls correct
me if I am mistaken).  I'm narrowed down between his and Auto Atlanta's
(I believe the Parts Werk ones are made by Brad, so I'd rather deal with
him directly); do you guys have any recommendations between the two kits?

And Rich, will your GT kit work in conjunction with Brad's or AA's kit?
I think those will wrap into the trailing arm area; doesn't your kit
overlap in some areas?  I've already boxed the trailing arms, and plan on
getting all the reinforcement done in one fell swoop; I do not plan on
revisiting this.....(famous last words =8^).  The only other area of
concern for me in that area are the trailing arms tabs.  I'd like to
reinforce those, but Andy's approach, trick as it is, was a bit more
intensive than I can handle....

Thanks,
Mike
(with a soon-to-be stiff-as-a-board chassis, and no wooden rockers)
