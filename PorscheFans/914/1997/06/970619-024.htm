Is it surface rust, or REAL rust?

How is the battery tray?  Or the engine shelf?

Look from the top, from inside the engine compartment.  Or drop
a very bright light in the compartment, and look from underneath.

Depending on the extent, it could be a couple hundred, or several
thousand to get fixed.  An afternoon with a wire brush, some naval
jelly,
and some rust proofer, or several weeks sandblasting, cutting, and
welding.
