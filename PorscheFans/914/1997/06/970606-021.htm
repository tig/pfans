Keep in mind that the Muir book is directed at VWs, Bugs and Squarebacks
and Buses. When he refers to "this type of car" he is looking at it with
the eyes of working on a car that supplies cheap, reliable
transportation. Not a sports car.

If Larry did the work on your car, I'd be supprised if were missaligned.
He is a consumate 914 guru. And I wouldn't doubt his skill at all. Are
you saying that the valve itself wouldn't close fully? That _would_
explain your high idle.

Hmm, all of the sweeper contacts should be making contact with the
board. If not, just tweak it a little to get it to touch the contact
again. This is not an ultra high precision device. By the way, your car
can run just fine without the switch at all.

I _think_ the swithc is the same. But I'm not sure. Anyone?
