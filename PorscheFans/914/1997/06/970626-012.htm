   Oh yes... Another question I wanted to ask. Where is the best
place to route the oil lines for a front mounted oil cooler in 
a 914? Actually, the only place that is giving me problems is from
the side valence to the inside of the front trunk.

   I was planning on running up the inside of the front fender well
to the top of the front trunk and then down underneath the gas tank
to the luggage compartment. Any better solutions?

   I spoke with George Vellios and he often uses EMT tubing in the 
side "valence" to save money and increase cooling. Anybody seen these
installations? How much tubing does he use? Is the tubing bent or
just straight fit? Thanks in advance.

Sooooo many questions,
Steve Iverson
