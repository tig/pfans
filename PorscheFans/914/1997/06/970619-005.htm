This, indeed, is true.  I travelled down to see him once and purchased
my
current chassis from him a few years back.  Brad is a straight-shooter
who
has a definate love of the 914.  Apparently his family owned a Porsche 
dealership in the area and he's owned, serviced and cared for 914s ever
since they went into production.

He also rebuilds transmissions ($400 + exchange) and was kind enough to 
except my tail-shifer core for a side-shifter with the linkage and 
mounts. 

To anyone in the central IL area, it is definately worth a visit to 
talk with him even if you don't need parts service.  When I was down
there he had 3 914s at his house (one his daily-driver which he drives
year round) and a beatiful 914/6 conversation which was making a visit
to have his stiffening kit installed.

He places regular ads in Pano and always has some classifieds on the
Renegade 914 web site....
