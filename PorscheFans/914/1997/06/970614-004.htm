It doesn't seem to be lean ... but I can't get my Cyberdyne O2 sensor to
work in the car -- it works fine on a test bench ;-)  A DMM hooked up to it
a long time ago suggested 0.4-0.6V values, so I wasn't concerned. BTW, I
welded an O2-sensor nut to the Bursch unit a couple of inches prior to the
entrance of the muffler itself. There's plenty of power, etc.

Also, I have a 1kOhm 10-turn rotary pot in series with the Head Temp
Sensor, and running it to either extreme has little or no effect on
temperatures.

I will admit, though, that enough pieces of data are missing that I'm not
about to rule out any one cause, e.g. running too lean or something unusual
in the fan's cooling.
