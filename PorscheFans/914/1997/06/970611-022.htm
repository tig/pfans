Good thing, or else we would all be out beating reeds to write this
stuff. :-)

Anyway my .02 cents on the subject.

We all can learn something from everyone we meet, read, or have contact
with.  No matter what intellectual level that person has attained.  There
are always at least two ways to do something, and neither are right or
wrong.  So the more prospectives we have on a procedure the chance of
doing it correctly the first time increase at an exponential rate.  We
have a broad level of knowledge here, to limit that knowledge to a
paragraph would be a shame.  Some times it is appropriate others it is
not.

If your intention was to reduce the bandwidth of the list, I don't think
you succeeded.

Take care,
Stephen Jacobs
Some times a long written person.
