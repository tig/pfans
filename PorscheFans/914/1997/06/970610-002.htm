 Howdy all, 

 Yesterday I picked up my bolt on adjustable proportioning valve kit
from George Wright. Very nice! Wilwood valve bolted to a Aluminum plate
with all the lines make up with the correct ends. Its a true bolt on (in
stock location)kit, and it comes with instruction too.
 If you need an adjustable proportioning valve you cant beat this set
up, alot of trouble saved and the price is right!

 Happy proportioning, 
 Don
