   Not that it matters too much, but I think that if the injectors are
constructed as you describe them, then the polarity WOULDN'T matter.  It
has been a long time since I played with dry cell batteries and 10-penny
nails, but I believe the iron core moves along the magnetic field gradient
into the center of the coil.  The SIGN of the magnetic field is irrelevant,
it is the gradient that matters.  Another way to say this, I believe, is
that you can't REPEL an unpolarized piece of ferromagnetic material (i.e.,
soft iron) with a magnet.

  Or I could be deluded....... or there may be grounding issues, or other
reasons not to switch the wires.
