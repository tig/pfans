I've talked to the guys at BBR and they weren't happy how the fiberglass
kits turned out.  I don't know if they recalled them or not, but the
offer a new kit with similar style, but it's done in steel and
fiberglass.  There is no part of the kit where fiberglass-to-fiberglass
connections are made.  That's where the problems were on the last kit, so
they said.  I've seen their video and they offer a few different cars,
the Speedster M.E.(mid-engine) being the most popular.  If i could afford
it, i'd luv to own one of their cars, but with the move out here and my
salary pretty much getting cut in half, i really can't afford it right
now.  Maybe next year??  Anyway, hope this helps!
Check ya laters,
