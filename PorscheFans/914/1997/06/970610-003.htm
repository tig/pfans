As a Red Wing fan and a Michigan resident, I thought I'd
pass the word that the Stanley Cup does indeed fit into
the backseat of a 993 Coupe.

Although it did take Steve Yzerman about 10 minutes to 
negotiate getting it in there...

Now for the real stuff and the continuing saga of trying
to get ready for the driving season this year...

So, spent some time under the car buttoning up the bottom
and reconnecting all the vitals - wiring, clutch, shift
linkage, etc.... spending all that time on my back, I got
to looking at my rear shocks.

They are yellow with adjustable perches which I assume 
(correct me if I am wrong) are bilsteins.  The springs
however, are flaky and rusting and don't look too hot
(which may explain the low ride height in the rear if
they are sagging and tired - which is why I had to lower
the *front*..but I digress).  

I think it's time for new rear springs - is there a test
to see if they're kaputt geworden?  The perches are set 
up pretty high already...  

Okay...let's say I get some 140# progressives or so. 
Haven't read the manuals on the procedure, but do the 
units simply unbolt and come off together and then 
the springs are changed with the shocks off of the car?

Just looking for a little insight into rear shock repair/
replacement as it's one of the few areas I haven't messed
with .....yet.  (Welding classes are this fall)

Thanks for any information, flames, horror-stories, or
rumors you can send my way...
