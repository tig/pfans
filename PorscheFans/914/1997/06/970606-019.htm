Yes, the whole front end is a bolt-on swap. It's one of the easiest ways
to beef up the 914 suspension, and it's fairly stright forward too.

Woah! Be carefull what you say there. I don't think anyone who has done
a 6 conversion would say that it's "no trouble at all". It's alot of
work, and will require some special hardware in addition. Engine mount
and oil tank for starters.

It's a 2.0L engine, and depending on the model it will have either 130,
160, or 210 hp. That is for the 911, 911S, and 911R models respectively.

Yup. But I can't give you specifics on engine numbers, I don't know
those.

Good luck. It is a major project. But usually well worth it.
