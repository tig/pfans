Which dimesnsion are you more interested in? I have found that 225/50
tires _can_ fit under the stock fenders. Just barely and with only just
the right offset. I'm now able to fit 225/50-14 tires under the stock
rear fenders with no contact (I don't know about rubbing yet), and I
have heard that some have been able to fit 225/50-15 on 15X7 wheels
under the stock fender, but like I said, it's a really tight fit. The
normally agreed on widest tire that will fit under the stock fender
without rubbing is a 205/60-15, now some say that a 205/50-16 could also
fit. I don't doubt it, but I'd never want a tire that tall, I don't have
the power to take advantage of the increased gearing to gain top speed.
So I'm going the other way and lowering my gearing as much as I can to
gain acceleration out of the turns.
