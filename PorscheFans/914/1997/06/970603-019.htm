Has anyone found a source for the seal that goes around the oil pressure
sender?
Price?  GPR said NLA when I ordered some other stuff?

For those interested in the improved grommet style Corvair spark plug air
seals
that were mentioned in the email by Bob Hoover that I forwarded to the list
the other
day, I found a local supplier of Corvair parts that makes up plug wire
sets. They don't
normally sell just the seals but I talked them out of a set of 6 ( for my
Corvair ya
know  ;-)   for $.75 each.  Check for a local supplier near you.

Also, the VW plug wire sets that JCW carries that have these seals are EMPI
brand.  You might be able to find a set near you.  JCW seems to have them
on
sale constantly for about $6.99  so if ordering something from them anyway
(their shipping charges are high)  it's worth it to order a set just for
the seals.
