Hmmm.  Good point about the window mechanism.  I'll look at that when I
remove all the interior and can see into the doors.   Interesting about the
'handcraftsmanship',  once I confirm that the body isn't rusting out
internally, I might try that if it isn't the window mechanisms.

I'll have it up on blocks soon so can get under it to do some other work.
I'll start poking around with the ice pick to confirm.

I saw a comment once, whether true or not I don't know, that the clamshells
can rust from the inside out.  They were talking about the tube inside the
clamshell for the heater and if the heater was used a lot moisture could
condense inside the clamshell and start rust.  If I had the bucks to blow
I'd get one of those couple hundred $ inspection probes like Eastwood
catalog carries now. Make a small hole into the end of the clamshell and
look inside.  Then use an undercoating wand to spray inside there.  Anyone
ever done this?

My project car spent most if not all of life in CA so little exposure to
road salt, probably not much heater use.  None not since not hooked up when
I got it.

If it's just the window and not the door, then it may just be an adjustment
on the window mechanism. Someone told me about how they adjust doors at the
Porsche factory. Imagine a big husky guy with a sledgehammer and a 2x4.
Take the the butt end of the 2x4 and put it against either the top or
bottom hinge part that is bolted to the body. Whack the other end of the
2x4 with the sledge and bend the body slightly. He said the car in the
video was a C4 Turbo. That's hand craftsmanship in action for you!

Yeah, but you gotta do the ice pick (or equivalent pointy tool thingy)
test.
