    Joshua:

    Yes, but it requires 911 front wheels.  Once you install THOSE,
    you'll probably want 911 wheels in the rear, too.  That, of
    course, requires 5-lug hubs.

    With 911 brakes, you'll probably want a 911 master cylinder and
    a Tilton proportioning valve, as well.

    ... And sheet metal, and a throttle linkage, and an exhaust, and
    oil presure/temperature gauges, etc.

    And...  Once you put the engine in the 914, you'll want stiffer
    rear springs to keep it off the ground.  Installing those springs
    will necessitate larger front torsion bars, and then you'll want
    to change out all the shocks to match your new springs.

    Next, you'll probably want to box the rear trailing arms and
    stiffen the chassis to keep the car from flexing and breaking in
    two.

    It's extraordinarily unlikely to have the 210-HP 911R engine;
    Porsche only built about two dozen of those cars.  If it's a
    911S, it WILL have 160 horsepower, but it'll also have a 9.8:1
    compression ratio... Which will require the use of high-octane
    gas.

    You can say that again.

    True, although it's best to have an idea of its scope BEFORE you
    start, so you're not surprised halfway through when you run out
    of money/energy and still have a "project".
