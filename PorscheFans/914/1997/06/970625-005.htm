Actually, you can often find Bburago and other comparable brands of 1:18 =
scale Porsches at Kay-Bee Toys for $13-16. Granted, the vintage models =
like the 356 are harder to find there -- the large toy chains like Toys =
R Us and Kay Bee carry all years of American cars, but on the European =
cars, they stick mainly to the more recent model years.

As far as I've seen, the 1:43 scale is only size die-cast 914 made. You =
can get the official Porsche version from Stoddard's for only $18 (or =
$50 from Automobile Atlanta -- go figure). =20

But you can also still get a plastic model kit of a 914 in 1:24 scale =
(about 6-7" long) along with a 928 and 911 as part of a three car kit =
called 'Revel Porsche Exotics' which was reissued last year.
