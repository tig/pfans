<pre>
a couple yrs ago a fellow had a genuine dealer-installed accessory 914
hitch at a swap meet somwhere in the Bay Area... we all rallied 'round &
much discussion ensued re: some fellow who used to tow his tires to the
autocross, etc.. the issue is tonge weight mostly & engine load secondly

I just got back from the PartsHeaven Swap & I towed a little "made-over
ford courier back-half" with my toyota corolla 1600.... the trailer has
about 20 lbs tongue weight empty & the same full of rock, it is well
balanced...  issues about load on the car's tail are a personal choice
about where the engines & elephants are placed...(also affects swaying
tendency) 

my car's hitch is bolted to the sheetmetal "crash" bumper.. it has done
a lot of towing this way, even towing a car dolly with a more-bigger car
behind.. this is not an acceleration champ in this configuration, & ya
gotta row the gears on hills, but it does work...

If you're short on cash & long on desire like me & lots of others,  I
wouldn't hesitate to invent a way to haul tires & the beer cooler to the
autocross or where-ever... for lots of us these are VINTAGE CARS &
"they" really did do stuff like this in the "vintage days"... carry on
the tradition! & share the perfect hitch design with us all PLEASE 
(somebody must still own that dealer accessory I saw at the swap)(wish
I'd bought it!!)
