	Been there, done that, have three t-shirts.  It's called
Autocrossing.  After about 3-6 months of experience, most autoXers
have enough experience to recover from getting the tail end out,
but frequently not enough to keep it from going the other way.  I
have seen many cars (914s and 911s) get sideways to the left, then
sideways to the right, then sideways to the left, then....  I think
the record for the most overcorrections that I've seen was four in
a row, with the fourth turning into a 180+ degree spin.  My own
personal best is only three.
	Yes, Josh2's trick of letting go of the wheel does work.
If you're ready to concede control of the car to the Gods of Inertia
and Friction, a 914 will often straighten itself out that way.  I
have lost my horn pad every time I've tried it, though.
