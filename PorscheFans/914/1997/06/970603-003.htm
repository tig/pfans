I also thought it might be the 009 distributor, at least in part.
Doesn't the vacuum advance on the stock 2.0 retard the timing at idle
just for the purpose of emissions? It sure doesn't hurt.

Since in my understanding retardation helps lower emissions (which ones
I can't say), I'd try retarding the timing as far as possible and still
run well enough to stay above suspicion. Next, I'd lower the fuel
pressure by swapping in the 2.O adjustible unit without the vacuum or
going to an aftermarket unit that has both vacuum and an adjustment for
baseline idle pressure. CB performance probably still sells one that in
addition to the above, has a rising rate, so there is a wider spread
between the idle fuel pressure and the wide open throttle fuel pressure.

Since the metering is on the L-system side, isn't there a way to lean it
out there?
