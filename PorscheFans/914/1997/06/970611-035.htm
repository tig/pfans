I do remember seeing a fuel additive once in a parts store that is
supposed to help you pass emissions; in fact, I think there was some
sort of guarantee.  I have no clue what this stuff was, or what was in it/how
it worked.  But it sounds like your car is pretty close to passing;
maybe this will let it squeak by.....

Good luck!
