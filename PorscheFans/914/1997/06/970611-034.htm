That sucks! And I would make a case of that being illegally biased.

MOVE! Move to another state. :) I passed with ease first time out here
in Colorado. Only one more test to go and I can register as a vintage
car and never have to get it smoged again as long as I own it. And I
plan on owning it 'till either one of us are good and dead. And even
then, I might get myself burried with it. :) Ok, maybe a little
extreem...

Find someone with a gas analyzer and pay them to let you use it a few
hours so you can tweak and tweak untill it's good. Beyond that I really
am at a loss. I wish I could be of more help. I know you know all of the
typical tweaks. Lean the sucker out as much as you can get away with.
Short out the HTS? Pour in a bottle of octane booster? Bribe the test
monkey? Maybe a drugged bannana?
