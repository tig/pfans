For Wesley Bullock (and other interested parties):

Hi Wesley!

  You asked:

  The easiest way to repack a CV joint is with a needle tip on a grease gun.  
Use a good grade of  molybdenum di-sulfide grease in the gun.  Clean all dirt off the half-shafts 
and CV joint boots with solvent (I use paint thinner).  Slip the needle under the boot where it 
contacts the half-shaft  (the manufacturer of the needle says it is for piercing the rubber boot... can be 
done, but better not to if not necessary... and pump a generous amount of grease into the boot.  
Squeeze the boot with your hands to work the new grease down into the joint.  Rotate the half shaft as 
you work the grease in.  
  That's basically all there is to it, PROVIDED that the CV joint rubber boot is intact.
If the boot has failed, allowing the ingress of dirt, then you will have to 
dis-assemble the joint, clean all parts in solvent, re-pack by hand, fit new gaskets AND new bolts, 
(and of course, a new boot) and re-install.
  The procedure in the Haynes manuals is OK, but I would make the following 
changes:

        Do not loosen the clamping strap on the rubber boot unless you are going to replace 
    the boot.  Remove the boot and protective cap together as a unit.
    
    Do not remove the roll pins, unless you are going to replace the entire 
CV joint.

  See my earlier posting (6-4-97) for how to align the innards of the CV joint so that it will work properly. 
 Remember, if the inside does not move freely in and out with respect to the outside, and if the inside 
does not freely tilt through a considerable angle, then it is not correctly assembled.  DO NOT attempt 
to install it on the car in this condition.  You probably won't be able to, but if you somehow managed 
it, you would likely break the gearbox.

                                                  Good Luck,
                                                  Jim T.
