284degF       F=C x (9/5)  +32      That is way too hot.

The temp in the heads seems to be about right.  The oil is doing it's heat
removal job.  I'd emailed with Bob Hoover about
oil temps at one point.  He mentioned doing lots of testing of some of his
engines on a test stand.  Put a probe into the valve cover through the
breather opening and measured the oil fog. Typically 100deg over the sump
oil temp.  Shows how important the valve covers and even pushrod tubes are
to oil cooling since they're in the closest contact with the hottest oil.

Not sure what temp oil will coke at.  I run regular dino juice in the Thing
and the 914 , but change at the regular intervals so
hopefully not a problem.  If I ever get all the oil leaks stopped I might
try the synthetics.  Always avoided them for air cooled since the old types
were suppose to be worse at picking up heat, I've heard the newer ones are
better at it.
