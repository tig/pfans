Ok that explains it.  Another question though.  Was the speedometer then
set up for the 165/80 or 175/80?  I want a larger profile tire, considering
the 195/65 Yoko A509's mentioned in other emails. I'd like to keep the
speedo as close to accurate as possible since this will be mainly a street
car.  The delta between a 165 and 175 is about 5%,
