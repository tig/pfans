Greetings 914-er's!

  I have a set of 4 alloy wheels on my 914 that are unknown (at least to 
me) as to manufacturer.  I would like to identify them so I can see if 
anyone has a fifth one that I can buy / trade for to mount my spare on. 
   All I can do is to describe them:  they are aluminum color and finish 
(shiny once, now dirty) and have eight holes in them in the form of 
equilateral triangles, with the point toward the hub, and the base toward 
the rim.  There is a slight outward bulge in the wheel in the area of these 
triangular holes.  I believe that the wheels are of stock width.  I believe 
that they are cheapies, but am not sure of that either.  
  If anyone can identify them from this description, please let me know 
what they are.  If not, perhaps someone will volunteer to scan in some 
pictures of them for me.  I am afraid that that is what I will have to do with 
my current spare rim, anyway... it is simply too detailed to describe 
well, and I would like to arrange a trade.

                              Thanks in Advance,
                              Jim T.
