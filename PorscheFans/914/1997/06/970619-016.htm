	I guess I don't understand the reasoning behind wanting "cheap" sticky
tires if you only do a few events per year.
	There are a few ways to put stickies on your car.  The most common is
to have a second set of rims with the stickies on them, and swap wheels either
the night before, or at the event.  Extra rims ain't all that cheap.  Or, you
could have only the one set of rims and have the tires mounted and balanced
before each event.  That ain't cheap either.  Or you could just have the race
tires on all the time, which tends to wear them out relatively quickly, unless
you only drive the car those 3-4 times per year.
	Just about any way you do it, you're looking at a moderate (at least)
amount of expense.  The $400-$500 for tires may be something of a hit, but if
you're doing so few events, the tires will last 4-5 years or more if you
store them right.
	Another option would be to locate some reasonably good street (hard
compound) tires and use them all the time--but we're still talking $400-$500+
bucks for AVS-is or the like.  Only one set of tires and rims to worry about
at that point.

	It's your car, you call the shots--but I'd suggest simply picking up
some A008 RS2s and putting them on some cheap steelies.  They're not the best
by a long shot, but they're still fun!
