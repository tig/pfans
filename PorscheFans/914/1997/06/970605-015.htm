Well, I finally figured out something that has been bugging me for years. 
I've been trying to figure out an effective way to get rid of rust. I've
tried sanding then painting, then I added cleaning with mineral spirits
between the sanding and painting part, etc. I've been developing an
effective system for years now (which is how long it's going to take me to
finish my 914), but as with all development, you make more mistakes than
successes. Like when I figured out that cleaning the part with paint
thinner, then drying it really made a big difference in whether the rusty
metal primer stuck or not and whether the rust came back or not. That was
a real shazam, for sure. Or when I figured out that using a 1" trim brush
on smooth metal left a bunch of brush marks, but using that same brush on
rough cast parts did not leave brush marks (or I couldn't see them). Then
I discovered fine ox hair brushes that worked pretty good on smooth metal
too, so for some parts I didn't have to use spray paint. Spray paint is a
pain to use if you dont' have a garage. Ever spray outdoors on a windy
day? Everything but the part gets sprayed. I hate masking stuff off, too. 
And runs, I hate runs. I use that quick-dry "professional" rustoleum when
I need spray paint, but of course the glossy stuff runs too. Of course,
that day that I got a big headache from spraying in close quarters went a
long way to turning me off to the stuff. Anyway, back to rust.

For those of us without blast cabinets (or who don't want to pay someone
to do it), we're left with either chemicals or abrasives to remove rust
before priming. I mean things like naval jelly, rust converter, etc, and
sandpaper, wirebrushes, etc. Naval jelly is prety cheap, and being
phosphoric acid, actually chemically reacts with rust to help slow it down
in addition to removing it. Anyway, I discovered that if I scrap as much
crud off the part with some impliment that was never designed to do this,
like a screw driver, and then take a small wirebrush and scrub the part
with naval jelly, it gets clean real fast and looks great after washing it
off with water. It may take 5 to 10 minutes of scrubbing, but it works a
helluva lot better than just letting the part sit there with the naval
jelly on it. The acid softens your bare hands too, for those of us that
want that :) I once let a part sit overnight outside and it rained. The
part rusted like crazy so I gave up that idea real quick. Scrubbing with 
a wirebrush full of naval jelly, with additional jelly added liberally, 
gets parts clean quick. That's my shazam for today.
