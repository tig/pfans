Interesting, all the ones I have seen done where on cars on a rotisory,
this is not a pig roast.  And they used the door braces.  Maybe with
pickup points the lift used, maybe the rear end sagged down to the proper
place.  I use that trick to get into sagging 914 to get parts out.  Set
the middle on a 4x4 with the appropiate number of cycnder blocks on the
out side.  Boy you would think all my parts cars are great, until you
pull the 4x4.

If you do this my suggestion is proceed with caution, yes it can be done
at home.  I am doing it, but I made a simple door holder, out of a 2x4
cut and taped into place.  From rear door strick to front hindge mount.. 
My car is supported on a 4x4 frame with wheels so I can move it about. 
Thsi box frame supports the center of the car only, the two ends hang
free.  I can bolt on and unbolt both suspensions with out problem, it is
nice.  So hey that gould explain the differences.  If you car sages, it
is a bad thing.

BTW, I have seen 914s with 4x4 pressure treaded boards inplace of the
inner rocker.  Must have been a previous Morgan owner.<g>
