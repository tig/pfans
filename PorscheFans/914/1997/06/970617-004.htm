Oh, boy, you've got your work cut out for you. How's the firewall? The
battery tray and suspension console?

You can get new reproduction outer clamshells for about 100$ each. If you
just have something welded over the rotted metal, it will eventually spread
to the new metal and you'll have to do it all over again. The car has to be
put into a jig to hold it true when the clamshells (inner rockers) are
replaced since they are major structural members. Since you say you're going
to race the car, welding good sheet metal over bad metal will just add
weight and not really fix the problem. You might as well get your roll cage
installed at the same time.

Check with your local racer club/friends for recommendations. Sounds like
you need to take it to a race prep shop.
