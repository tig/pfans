I know we've discussed this before, but I've thought about it some more and
found another twist on the cost of restoring old cars. (I'm not particular
about "old car" vs. "vintage" vs. "classic" like some people are)

Usually when people talk about whether a car is worth restoring they refer
to the highest possible resale value of that model of car in restored
condition. They typically say that investing more than the car is worth is
not smart or that it's better to buy somebody else's restoration project.
Also, most people say that you'll never get your investment back because it
always costs more to fix up a car than what they sell for once fixed up. 

I would disagree with this point of view. I think the comparason of the cost
of restoration to the resale value of the car is incorrect. Since after a
car is restored it is essentially a "new" car, not to say even a "hand
built" car, then the correct comparason is to a new car. So, how nice can
you make a 914 for the average new car cost of 20 thousand dollars? Assuming
that the restored 914 would begin to depreciate immediately upon completion
of the restoration, which car would have more value after 10 years, the
20,000$ Nissan or the 20,000$ Porsche. I would bet the 914 would have more
value. Further, since a restored car has been thoroughly inspected and
disassembled/reassembled, the restored car is a known quantity, whereas an
unrestored newer car is definitely an unknown "black box." (we all know that
from our initial purchases). 

Another way to look at is to compare monthly costs. So, how much bodywork
and parts can you buy for the average car payment of 400$ per month? A whole
bunch, that's for sure. Given that a "collector" will hold its value, that
400$ looks like a much wiser investment than paying off the interest and
principle on a new car that is depreciating like a rock sitting in your
driveway. Of course, if you were clarivoiant you could pick a future
"collector" and buy it now. 

Stacked on top of all this is the fact that these older cars are much easier
to work on and it tips the scale for me heavily in the direction of older
"collector" cars. The trick though is to stick with popular older cars,
preferably ones that are still raced. Racing seems to really keep cars
alive. I dont' know if it's the puplicity or the fact that the racers spend
all that money on parts, but parts availablity seems much better for cars
that are still raced than for cars that are not. 

What does everyone think? Am I crazy to own only old collector cars?
