All the responses I've read point to the same thing, but here's my
thoughts: 

If you buy an 914 for the usual 'good price' of between $2500 and $3500,
you're likely to get a decently solid car in very original condition.
This kind of car will need lots of work (and $$$) over the years to
replace, fix, renew, and rebuild everything.  To end up with a really
nice 914 that doesn't need anything other than regular oil changes and
valve adjustements, you'll end up investing around $7000 - $10,000.
This is where most of us started and few of us have achieved (or will
ever achieve) the end goal.  But this is the way to get to drive one of
the most fun automobiles in the world on a shoestring budget.

Or you can find one that has already been completely renovated.  These
are usually in the $5000 - $7500 range.  It is probably a cheaper route
in the long run, but you don't get to learn anything about the car and
don't get the satisfaction that comes from knowing that YOU did all the
work to make it that nice.  And, when something does go wrong, you don't
know how to fix it so you're at the mercy of someone else's mechanical
abilities.

I bought my 74 2.0 for $1800, put it on the road for $2800, have
finished most of the mechanical and  'underside' things for $5800, will
soon re-install the fuel injection for a total of $6300 and in the next
few years do all the cosmetic things (paint, rubber, etc.) for an
estimated total investment of $9500.  At this point, assuming I lost my
mind and sold the car, I'd be lucky to get $7000 for it - even though it
will be an completely renovated/restored car.  And if I'd had someone
else do all the work?  Probably would've cost me well over $20k!  (BTW,
those dollar amounts are running totals, not the amounts spent for each
stage.)

Just my opinion (and life story).
