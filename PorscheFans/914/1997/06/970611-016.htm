Yeah, Dave, I'm still laughing over your story about doing your rear brak=
es.
If I lived near you, I'd come over your house and fling myself on to the =
hood
of your car and yell to the heavens: "I sacrifice myself in the name
Ferdinand!!"  to protect your car from your hammer and punch.  :-)

it.

The pads I bought had somewhat square holes that were also too small.
A few intimate moments with a reamer fixed those pads right up.
