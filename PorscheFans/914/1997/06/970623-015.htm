Hello all,

I have taken over production of the 914 combo Gauge from Don Hanney. 
This is the gauge that was just recently featured in Pano and originally
made by Stan Cooper.  I have tried to up hold his excellent product and
craftsmanship.

The gauge face and back are made from .060 hot rolled steel.  Both items
are machined to a tolerance within two thousands of an inch.  I then send
the front gauge face out for powder coating, in a black that matches the
current gauges.  Could do custom colors upon request.  Then the lettering
is printed onto the face in the same font and size, in white.  The rear
face is plated in cadidium to match, closely, the original gauge back
color.  The plates are then boxed and ready for shipment along with the
instructions for the procedure and gauge numbers and senders that work
with those gauges.

This gauge is ideal for any 914-6 or conversion, or any 914-4 owner that
wants to run a oil pressure and temperature gauge along with your fuel
gauge and not have to add gauges out side the dash.

I am trying to keep the cost under a $100.00 per kit, and it may be less
than that even, including shipping with in the Continental United States.
 Still waiting on a few quotes to come back in to finalized pricing.

If you have an interest or want to be updated when final delivery date
and pricing are established please drop me a note, via private e-mail.

Take care,
Stephen Jacobs
