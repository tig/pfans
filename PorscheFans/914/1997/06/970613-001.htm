You can repair that one yourself easily if your plug is decent. Take the
back cover off of the plug and you'll see that each pin has a solder
pot for connecting the wire. Just take one pin out at a time, heat it up =
to
remove the old wire, remove the excess solder, and solder in a new
wire.

Also the wire should be tin plated to maintaint low resistance over time.
The irradiated PVC is good to 105degC and is much cheaper than
teflon if you wanted to save money.
