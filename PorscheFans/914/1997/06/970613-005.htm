The problem is this, inherent to the engine design, all VW-s, 356-912,
and our 914-4 engines.  Is that the oil under cornering force will flow
out to the outside cylinders head.  Which ever way your head leans in a
corner, your oil will flow in that directions.  If your head leans in a
straight line oil does not flow there, I am talking cornering here.  But
there are solutions, factory and what people have thought up.

Well, depending on the engine rebuilder you may be okay.  I have a friend
that runs track events, PCA club racing, drivers Ed, and auto-x.  He has
no problems with the oil "Problems" as they are know.  If your rebuilder
was good he would have installed a late model windage tray into your
engine.  Early engines do not have this item, it is a must for any 914. 
Next trick is run some extra oil in the sump, your crank is way up in the
case so it will not be whipping the oil, I believe the magic number is
3/4 to 1 extra quart.  You can do the oil trick alone for now, since the
other requires splitting the case, but I would check with the rebuilder
and see if it is in there.

What size engine do you have? Better yet first two letters off the engine
number would be exact, we could then tell you if your engine came factory
equipped with such a device.

  After that the only other thing that I do which is kind of redundant is
use some old push rod tubes and stick the case so you have about 3/4"
exposer on the interior of the case.  This with the windage tray means
that the oil has to backup 3/4" actually more do to angle of the car and
cornering force applied. before it starts to run out the pushrod tubes
and out to the head. I peen them over to match the case and seal it into
place.  Then install the real pushrod tube and seal like normal.  This
also can only really be done in a rebuild since you need to measure
everything, and make sure they do not contact with anything in the
engine.

I am not a big fan of deep sumps or cups, they just hang down to low.
Most I have seen hang down 3-4 inches.   You run the risk of hitting it
on something and loosing all your oil.  That will toast an engine
quickly.  If you do decide to run one I would add a skid plate that bolts
off the cross bar and runs back to the front of the tranny.  This adds
weights, complexity, may cause a cooling problem reduces access to the
bottom of the engine.

I would personnely like to hear if anybody has lost one of these deeps
sumps in normal use.  Example: driving down the road and hitting a curb. 
Laugh, I once lost a VW rabbit water pump that way, I got run off the
road where it narrowed from wide two lane to a narrow two lane.  I have
run a deep sump on my ghia, and I did make a difference, I would loose
oil every day on this one curve.  Turning the engine off in the middle of
the curve is not the ideal situation.  But I also raised the rear of the
car up to gain some extra ground clearance.  They make sense, but I just
don't like them hanging down there.

  Or you can run an accusump which holds an extra quart of oil and is
pressurized by your system.  But I think these have there own set of
problems.  Never tried one, but allot of people seem to use them.

Also if by chance this is a 2.0L engine that got transplanted into your
car.  You will want to consider an external oil-cooler, on the track your
engine will probably get to hot.  The 1.7L seem to be okay, but the 2.0L
will warrant you to check temps.

Yes, dry sumping will fix all the above problems, but if you want to run
the car in a PCA race under stock rules you are illegal, and PCA auto-x
does not allow for this modification either with out being in a modified
class. It comes down to reading the rule book.

Also an extra quart of dynojuice is cheaper than the following any day. 
To dry sump you will need the following items:

Oil Pump - approx. $450
914-6 Oil tank or other - new 914-6 oil tank is $450 form Rich Johnson
Oil lines - figure minimum - $100
Cap off the oil filter mount - $???? the six tank has a oil filter
Labor - 5-6 hours if they know what they are doing at $50-$75 an hour.

Chaaa Ching!!!!  I have minimum $1250 then I would tack on 30% above just
for things that happen.  This conversion would realistically be $1625.00,
just for an oil system.  compared to $3.50 for expensive oil, which means
you have to change your oil 464 times before you recoup the cost or
travel 1,392,857 miles, at 3000 mile change intervals.  I can think off a
lot of things to do to your car with that kind of coin.

Suspension, wheels, tires, seats, harness, cage if you desirer, brakes,
helmet.  Gee for that money I found a running 2.4L 911 engine.  But a six
conversion is a lot more money. Or allot of seat time at track events,
about 7 events would be covered in the above monies at Mid-Ohio.  That is
entrance fees none of the other expenses, figured in.

Sorry if it is to long!
