	Andrew (or Andrew, sometimes I confuse them!) described a dry
sump system in wonderful detail already.  As Steve Jacobs noted, it is
probably overkill for anything but a track-only car.
	As for whether or not you need some improvement to the oiling
system, I would say YES.  When I started autoXing my 914 (stock suspen-
sion and hard street tires), I noticed that my oil light came on in one
sweeper.  At 4500 RPM.  Not a reassuring sight, let me tell you.  I
found out that this was due to the pump pickup starving for oil, as
Steve described.
	$50 at AutoMashin' later, I had an "oil trap".  This replaces
the stock sump plate and screen, and extends the stock pickup tube.  I
have only seen the light come one once in a corner since then--and that
was doing about six on-ramps in a row, all right-hand turns.
	So far, no ground clearance problems.  The oil trap sticks down
about 1.5", and is (I think) at or above the bottom of the engine mount
bar.  I figure if I am gonna hit the bar on something, the engine is
probably dead anyway...
	BTW, I stopped using my AutoMashin' one, and bought an old Gar-
retson one from Bontempi.  The Garretson one uses a sump plate for the
bottom of the trap, while AutoMashin's is flat.  My first one bowed in
after a while, and the top of the pickup tube extender got mangled.  No,
I didn't overtorque the nut.

	The cooler probably won't help much if any.  It won't supply oil
to the engine unless there is oil going into it to push the oil already
in it back to the engine.
	As I said above, the oil light comes on when you get to very low
pressure (about 3-5 PSI, I think).  If it is during a long-ish turn, it is
probably because all your oil is in the cooler or in one head.  With the
trap, don't worry about it until you start zooming around off-ramps with-
out any straights in between them.
