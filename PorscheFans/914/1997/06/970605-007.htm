PFans:

I'm going to Europe next week to cover the Le Mans race, and you WON'T find
it here on PorscheFans! PCNA will carry stories, digital photos, and hourly
updates on its web site (http://www.porsche.com). The Le Mans specific pages
are not yet active, but should start going up this coming Monday.

There will be three of us covering the race -- Bob Carlson and Joe Hansen of
Porsche Cars North America, and myself. 

This promises to be an epic Le Mans for Porsche. The race entries include
last year's winner, the Joest Porsche Le Mans prototype; a two-car Porsche
factory team running the 911 GT1, plus half a dozen private teams running
GT1s. There will be strong competition from Nissan (in which Martin Brundle
set fastest time in prequalifying) and of course BMW-McLaren, which had its
collective nose severely bloodied by Porsche last year. The Dodge Vipers look
strong in GT2, and the Saleen Mustangs are a surprise to everybody. Half of
the GT2 field consists of Porsches, though, including last year's class
winner, the Roock Racing team, and anybody who has been to Le Mans knows that
sometimes, it helps to show up with an army.

We hope you'll look in on our web site during the race, and enjoy our
coverage.

Pete Albrecht
