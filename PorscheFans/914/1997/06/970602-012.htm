If you're regularly running over 230F, you're too hot. And if you hit
250 frequently, you're way too hot. Synthetics can be worth an easy 10
degrees, sometimes more. An oil cooler can sometimes be worth up to 40
or so degrees. Step one, check your fan. Are there any blades missing?
If there are, that can definately lead to cooling problems. If there are
any openings in the sheetmetal that aren't plugged, that can do it too.
The biggest culprit is usually the timing inspection port. If that
plastic cap is missing, alot of your cooling pressure is lost before the
air even makes it into the shroud. But things like spark plug seals, and
other grommets and the like can cause cooling problems as well.

Lots of 'em. Especially turbo cars. And 911s all. Most air cooled cars
for that mater, and alot of air cooled bikes too.
