Yup, and I've heard about Corrless from Eastwood. POR-15
is an isocyanide (many death warnings). Both are more
expensive than I'm willing to pay - but the real reason is
convenience. I have to be flexible about working on my
car because I never know very far in advance whether
I'll either feel up to it, the weather is good or I have some
other things that need doing. I hate not being able to do
it because I don't have the materials. Rustoleum products
are very convenient, but they are probably inferior to
these two products.

How I feel physically and attitudinally greatly effects my
performance and enjoyment when working on my 914.
I prefer to only work when I'm "up" for it, rather than
because I'm forced to. It's directly opposite to working
for money, since you have to do it regardless of how
you feel (unless you're really sick, of course). Working
on my 914 is kindofa antidote for paid work. So, to
enhance my pleasure, I go for the products that are
convenient rather than absolutley better. For the more
serious painting (as in bodywork), I'll pay someone to
do that. I'm just restoring little bits and pieces "while
I'm in there." Like, when's the last time you did a
rear brake job/repair and had a good look at your
hubs and trailing arm and saw all that rust? Well,
I can't stand to not do something about it, so since
I've got it all apart, I might as well do my best to
fix the rust and make it look pretty. But, I can only
paint when the weather is warm and dry with a
fairly low wind, so that's another reason this takes
sooo long. I waited all winter for warm weather to
get some painting done. Hell, I would take
advantage of the occasional wam day to rush out
to the storage place and get some painting done.
I'm still waiting for warm weather. We're having a
cool time right now, and the early rising sun has
been cutting short my beaty sleep. O well, I'll get
there some day.
