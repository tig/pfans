Andrew and fellow 914-folks,

They were more "half-lemon" sized.  I am actually one of those wierd people
who does actually check the pressure regularly.  (My mechanic has told me
he thinks I am his only customer to do so.)  So, I doubt this is the
culprit.  My guess is that this was a "bad batch" of P-Zeros.  I will
consider P-Zeros in the future, but the BMW Digest has MANY instances of
people having problems with the P-Zero, especially in the rather strange
225/45 ZR-16 size.  Most complaints are about them being "out-of-round"
even when band new.  So, my advice is to check you tires VERY carefully
when buying these very costly tires. (My M3 tire are MUCH more expensive
than 914 tires, but still they are expensive for all cars.)

BTW, another tire to check out are the top-of-the-line Sumitomos (HTZs?).
They make a tire that is better than the D40 M2 for less money (and in more
sizes.)  If you didn't know, Sumitomo is the Parent company of Dunlop.  I
have heard many compliments about this tire in the M3 world...

Good luck to all,
