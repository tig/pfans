  It is somewhat difficult, in my experience, to locate the position of an air 
leak by sound.  Are you sure that you were not hearing the normal 
leakage past the rings when the engine is turned over slowly?  Bear in 
mind that if the seal was perfect, you would not be able to turn the 
engine over by hand at all, or only with great difficulty.  A hiss as 
trapped air escapes past the rings is normal when turning the engine 
over slowly by hand.

                                        Regards,
                                        Jim T.
