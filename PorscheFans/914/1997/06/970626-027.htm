	Yup.  Or is that "Nope"?

	OK, OK.  RD is still probably pretty busy, so I'll repeat what
he sent to the list a number of months ago:
	The retard gets regular manifold vaccuum.  When the throttle is
closed, there's a pretty high vaccuum, and the diaphragm in the dashpot
(I *think* that's what the UFO is called) retards the timing.
	The advance gets vaccuum from just above or just at where the
throttle butterfly sits when closed.  When the throttle just starts to
open, there is a small gap between the edge of the butterfly and the bore
of the throttle body.  The small gap causes the air that's going through
that gap to flow pretty quickly, which creates a low pressure area where
the air is moving quickly (the Bernoulli effect).  That area of low pres-
sure (==high vaccuum) is what the advance mechanism taps off of.
	I don't know if the retard mechanism has started to relax by the
time the advance mechanism starts working.

	Finally, all the above info came from RD's studies of his 76 2.0,
which is not an early 1.7 as you noted.  Yours may indeed be different in
detail, but I would be surprised if the principles behind it were very
different.
	The distributors rotate in the same direction, AFAIK, so the
advance and retard should be on the same side of the dashpot as on the 2.0.

	So, is everyone confused enough now?
