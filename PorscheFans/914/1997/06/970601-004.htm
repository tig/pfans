Hey guy's what's up!  Just got off the plane a few hours ago and am
getting settled in LA.  Only 300 more messages to read and i'll be caught
back up (i hope).  Am trying to go to BBR sometime this week to check
them guys out.  Guess i'll stop by Otto's also since they are right next
door.  Did anyone get a post bout Exoticaautos(??) who finances kit cars?
 I think i got it off one of my other lists (kitcar list i think) and was
trying to get it back as the address is on my sisters computer!  She
won't have it up for a few weeks and i'd like to make some calls before
too long.  Anyway, if anyone is in the Sherman Oaks area and wants to
show off their 914, i'd be more than happy to check some local cars out! 

Check ya laters,
Kevin

PS Still lookin' for a 914!
