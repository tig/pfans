Ahhh, sometimes we forget the oblivious.   But for the tool man in all of
us....  Of course you could speed the process up with a cooler of (I mean
Bobcat bucket of) dry ice, just don't stick your tongue on the bearing.
:-'o Doahhh!
 A C02 fire extinguisher would also work for this.  A can of freeze-it
may take to long.  

So the recipe should go like this.

Place bearing in freezer over night.
Next morning when S.O. leaves the house place trailing arm in oven at 350
degrees.
Bake for 2 - 3 hours until done, or S.O. comes home.
Bast bearing with lube of choice, slide into place.
Seat bearing with a few gentle blows from object of choice - just to make
sure the bearing is where it belongs.
Toss something into the oven to coverup the smell of baking oil / paint /
crud off the trailing arms.  Usually burning something in the oven will
make enough of a stench she will never know what you did.

Note:I use an old gas grill for this, the above is just more
entertaining.  But a gas grill works well for heating the odd part,
baking on paint and the like.  And with some oven cleaner and the heat
you can get dirty parts really clean fast.  And your neighbors will know
you have flipped.  

Mine already think that I am crazy, since they see 3 914s and a Karmann
Ghia at my house, and probably were calling the Police when a few friends
should up yesterday all driving 914s.  Yep, I have started the first
chapter of a 914 Porsche gang.  We all dress in the dirty Ts with grease
marks and the torn jeans, and spend all day fixing these cars only to
terrorize this sleepy little town at dusk when we take all the american
muscle cars and leave them eating our dust on the back country twisties. 
The best part is my other friend makes a killing on towing these guys out
of the ditch every saturday night.  Just a kidding.

Or maybe it is true the X-files is considering doing an episode on us,
since the neighbors think these are low flying UFOs.  

It came out ta nowhere officer.  All a sudden like we were blinded by the
bright lights, with other multicolored lights.  Shot past us, and
disappeared as fast as it came.  Can you describe any thing else, says
the officers.  Yes Sir, it had a strange howl kind of like a combination
demon form hell, and a VW beetle.

US government press release states it was a low flying weather balloon.

Now if I could only afford the glow in the dark paint for  the car, and
an E.T. mask.  Or better yet an Elvis mask.  I saw Elvis driving that
thing,and he was grinning real big like.  Yep, that he was, and he pulled
into that dounut stand just down the road.  Got a bunch of jelly filleds
and left in a blur of powdered sugar and gas fumes.

Boy it must be late, or I have been sniffing to many paint fumes tonight.

Take care,
Stephen Jacobs
