	Two more really good ones today at lunch.  Both idiotic maneuvers
were pulled off by persons driving pick-up trucks.
	First, I'm stopped at a red light on a big (3 lanes each way)
street.  The teenager in the Honda to my right (with obligatory 8-inch
wide chrome exhaust tip on a 2-inch wide exhaust pipe) makes his car go
"vroom, vroom."  Guess he just doesn't like red lights.
	Some bozo in a pickup in the lane to my left decides this must
mean that the light is green, so why bother looking up to see if the car
in front of him has moved?  He lurches forward and smacks into the back
of the car that has been in front of him the *whole time* at this light.
WHAM!  Must have been going at least 5 MPH--thank God for 5 MPH bumpers.
He then waves his hands in front of his face, as if to say "I didn't see
you there!"  (Famous Last Words.)
	It looked like nobody got hurt, happily.  But I do wish the truck
had an airbag in it.  I'd have laughed if it had gone off and taken the
windshield with it.
	The second exhibition of Driving While Stupid happened on the
highway.  (101 South, if you must know.)  There was some woman in a sta-
tion wagon doing about 55 (in a 65 zone).  Evidently this was not nearly
fast enough for the pickup truck following about 8 feet behind her.  The
driver YANKED the wheel to move over into my lane, cutting me off pretty
badly, passed the wagon on the right (in the right-most of four lanes),
then YANKED the wheel to cut back in about 8 feet in front of the poor
clueless lady in the wagon.  He didn't quite get the right-rear wheel
airborne, but he came pretty close.
	Then he sped up to about 75 (I decided to pace him for giggles)
for the remaining mile I was on the freeway.

	Aah, ya gotta love those California drivers.
