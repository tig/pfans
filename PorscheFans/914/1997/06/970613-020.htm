Mike G's analysis of restoring 914s is right on, IMHO.
$2500-$3500 buys a nice, original, fairly solid car in So.
Cal. But not one that just needs an oil change every now
and then. I bought my 74 2.0 for $2500 (should have paid
less). It was a solid car. But the paint was bad. So I
painted it myself for $500. Then the trans wasn't shifting
like I wanted, so I took it out and had it rebuilt ($1000)
and put a new clutch in ($300). Then it started smoking
and using oil, so I pulled the engine out, bought all new
parts, and handed the short block in to FAT for a rebuild.
(total cost of engine, even buying all the parts myself at
the lowest prices I could find, and doing much of the work
myself, $3500+. New factory valves, Euro P+Cs, cam, etc
are not really cheap!). Then I replaced all of the FI
parts, redid all the engine sheetmetal, etc, new factory
muffler, new tires, rechromed bumpers, new lenses, etc.
I'd say that I now have almost $10,000 in it, and that is
doing most of the work myself. But do I think its still a
deal? Yes!! I've daily driven the car for 5 years and over
60,000 miles. I've had great fun learning how to paint,
pull the engine, diagnose the FI, etc. I've made a lot of
friends in the process. And, I've ended up with a 914 that
now looks and drives like new, and really does only need
oil changes and valve adjusts, and is ready for another
150,000+ miles (my orig engine had just turned
200,000).So, I think it has been worth it. On the other
hand, if you don't do any of the work yourself, the costs
could easily eat you up. Sorry for the ramble!
