Dudes:

A few people have asked for ISBN numbers for the books I recommended
a couple of days ago.

Mel Kay's "914/4 - 914/6 Handbook", published by Lash International,
has neither an ISBN nor a Library of Congress card-catalog number,
but I THINK it's available from Automotion and/or Tweeks (the cover's
bright yellow; maybe that information will help you find it).

I have no idea whether the Porsche factory workshop manuals have
ISBN numbers (I don't own a copy), but you won't need an ISBN to get
those, anyway... You can just buy them from your local dealer.

Ok... Here are the numbers I DO have; I've also included approximate 
retail prices (in US dollars) for all the books except the 
factory manuals (which vary in price depending upon the year and 
model of your car):

    0-89586-377-4 $17 Weber Carburetors (Braden)
    0-85696-393-3 $17 Weber Carburettors Workshop Manual
    0-87938-776-9 $20 Winning: A Race Driver's Handbook

Two notes:

Bruce Anderson's "Porsche 911 Performance Handbook" is now available 
in a second edition; the new ISBN is 0-76030-033-X.

My original book recommendations were for 914 owners, but Terry
Shugart has told me about a 911-oriented book that sounds like an
absolute must-have for everyone of the 6-cylinder persuasion:  It's
called the "74-89 911 Parts Tech Book"; it shows all parts currently
available from Porsche and includes exploded views of the
sub-assemblies as well as technical info on upgrades (tensioners,
clutch, etc.).  The best news is that it only costs $6.95 and is
available at all Porsche dealers.

Hope this helps someone...
