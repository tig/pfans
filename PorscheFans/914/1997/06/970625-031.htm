There are several ways to approach this.  My project came with 5 lug 911
Fuch's mounted using 4-5lug adapter plates.  I don't like adapters.  I was
starting to look into it then Don  (dl9146) picked up a set for me already
made up from a swap meet.  What I got was a set of 914 front rotors
modified for 5 lugs.  They drill the 5 lug pattern and add the wheel studs.
This is quick. The drawback is that when I eventually have to replace the
front rotors due to wear I'll have to pay to have the new ones studded.

The rear hub has also been drilled and studded with the 5 lug pattern and
the rotor I got had the holes for the 5 lug pattern drilled in it.  When I
have to replace the rear rotor I can get a true 5 stud hole one, I've seen
them in various catalogs from $ not much more than the stock 914/4 rotors
to $$$ so shop around.  I had to have the old 4 lug hub pressed out. Used
the opportunity to have the rear bearings replaced. Then the 'new' 5 lug
hub pressed in.

Dirk recently posted some info on procedures and tools to DIY so you may be
able to do your own hub removal and install. Just have to pay for the
studding of the hub and rotor.

This seems the easiest to do without major changes.  Another way to do the
front is get the front from a early 911 and replace the whole strut
assembly. This gets you the better 911 front brakes, possibly vented
rotors, etc.  This is what I was looking for when Don found me the deal on
this setup.  I also got a set of 320i calipers free so am going that route.
Just have to rebuild them,  already got them machined.

I'd blink my lights back but have had little project time lately and still
have a bunch of electrical gremlins to kill <grin>.

(Quick Word: Thanx to all who make this list so great. I Blink my lights
in true Porsche Tradition to you all.)

Joshua Hadler posted a while back that it would be easy enough to swap to
5 lub Hubs and add cookie cutters, phone dials or whatever else is 911
available. Can someone explain exactly how to accomplish this? Mines a
daily street machine and I don't need or want to change from stock brakes
or anything like that. Does someone make aftermarket hubs for 914 to go
from 4 to 5 bolt without wheel spacers? I've seen enough VW bugs around
here to realize that fuchs are the "thing" for all the lowered chrome
machines blasting down the road. Alot easier with 5 bolt drum hubs, huh?
