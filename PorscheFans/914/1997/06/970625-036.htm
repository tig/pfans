 . . .  Also, I was reading
on the list that when you install a front 
swaybar, you must weld the mount that 
goes on the inside of the gastank well. I 
get the feeling from the instructions from
Weltmeister that welding is not needed.
Can anybody comment on this?  . . . .

Depends upon intended use and degree of "while you're in there" you suffer 
from, I suppose, but our Ginther-style vintage racer had been raced hard for 
over ten years and none of the holes were enlarged (plates were not welded).  

Now if you don't check the bolt tightness occasionally, the plate could slip 
and start wearing away at the body, but it's not too likely any other way I 
can imagine.

The down side (minor) is that you'll have to buy new plates if you transfer 
the bar to another car at some point.
