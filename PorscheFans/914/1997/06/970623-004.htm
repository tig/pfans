All -

Okay, checked out the car myself yetserday afternoon.  Found that the car 
runs but is very rough and barely idles.  I smelled lots of gas and the 
exhaust is verrrry black and very sooty.  As you rev the engine it seems 
to get better above 3-3.5K but still seems rough and has a lot of 
black/sooty smoke.

Ignition seems fine to me (all spark plugs have good spark) and the head
temperature read about 1600 ohms when slightly warm (still has stock
resistor in place).  Trigger points are good.  And disconnecting each 
injector or spark plug to each cylinder didn't give us any clues (nothing 
changed).

Received a phone call from Joshua and we discussed the problem (all the
way from Colorado, thanks Josh!).  Maybe fuel pressure regulator has gone
bad and running to high a pressure or a cold start valve that isn't
shutting off (sounds more likely).  What do the rest of you think? 

The way things were/have been decribed to me, it seems more like a sudden
failure than something that gradually got worse. 

Thanks for all of your input.
