>Ever hear of POR-15?  Heard it's the miracle cure for rust.

Not a mircle cure all for rust, it has its place.  But it just covers
rust and seals out moisture.  Good for pouring down into seams and places
you want protected for a long period of time.  If you are going for a
nice finished surface, physical removale is ussally the best beat.  Not
that it can't be done with paint, but each item has it's place. 
 I tend to us POR - 15 for a seam pour product.  I use Eastwoods zinc
primer behind my welds patches, down side is the weld is not as nice
looking, up side is the area is proteced behind the pannel.  I then will
pour POR - 15 down into the seams, and let it flow thru the area where I
can not get to physically.  Watch out this stuff will bond to your floor,
you, and other items you never wanted to paint.  Drop cloth or pans are a
must.  I tend to use corroless another Eastwood product for my inner
fenderwells and areas in which I want to paint and have turn out nice. 
But I still remove as much rust as possible sand blast or for parts to
big for the blaster the 3M abresive impregnated discs work wonders.  Then
I coat the are with corroless, or acid etch it to get the rest of the
rust.  

Corroless is nice because it is sandable, possibilities for a nicer
finish is there.  POR - 15 is not really sandable, yes it can be done but
you are there for ever before you make a dent in the stuff.  POR - 15
also does not stick well to a smooth surface so if you are fixing just a
rock chip, it may peel right off, because the surrounding metal is too
smooth.  I also like corroles for its high build characteristics, so if
the surfance has deep pits corroless tends to fill the pits.  POR - 15
tends to leave the pitted surface.  POR - 15 does not take a top coat
very well also, with out additional steps in the process.

Also you never use POR - 15 in any spray gun you want to last, it does
not treat all the passages in the gun very well once it sets.  Everything
has it place, but I grab POR - 15 much less than Corroless, about a 4 - 1
ratio.  And I grab my sand blaster almost every night, at worst case it
is stress relief, best case is I did get something done.

To that end I built a blast cabinet, and have about $125 invested in it. 
I used Scat blast components their gun and pickup tube are great, no
surges or dryouts.  Built the whole unit large enough to hold a 914 2.0L
muffler or heat exchangers.  Have the gloves and glass bead.  Two halogen
lamps give me light and an old shop vac gives me the suction to collect
the dust.  Works very well, and I know have a blast cabinet that is big
enough to handle most of my work. 

Take care,
