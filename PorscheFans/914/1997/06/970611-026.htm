If you don't want to (can't) work on a car, don't buy ANY 20 year old
car.

If you want to learn how to work on a car, buy something cheap, and
practice.  It's a skill like any other, and you get better with
practice.

As far as maintence costs, comparing a 914 to other 20 year old sports
cars, it comes out about the same.  They all have their quirks, and
expensive spots.  And the largest (by a very large margin) difference
in the cost of ownership is "how well the previous owner (DPO) took
care of the car."

$.02,
