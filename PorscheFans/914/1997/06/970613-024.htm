I didn't ask that specifically. My impression from reading his stuff is
that it would be the stock. with original black paint or else cleaned and a
thin flat black paint for the best heat transference.  I'm not sure about
the heat transferance of the generally thicker cast ones.  Most I've seen
are also shiny for the 'kool' look, but would be worse for heat transfer.

I know that getting the aluminum ones to seal on head can be a pain.  I had
some that I tried (wire bale type)  when I first built the 1776 for the
Thing. Leaked like a sieve, put stock back and no leaks.
