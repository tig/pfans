Dave,
        I got mine to pass with flying colors.  But there is a process.  It
is "easy" to get a tuned car to pass on the idle pollutants by just
adjusting your idle adjustment screw on the "brain".  As for the high rpm
test, that's a little more difficult.  You have to pull out the pressure
sensor and remove the cover on the end.  It is put in with epoxy, so you
will either have to take a flame thrower to it or use a Dremel tool like I
did (are't Dremels great?).  The screw that you expose is the adjustment
screw for your over-all mixture.  Pay the guy at the smog check $10 and tell
him you want to adjust your mixture.  Turn your idle mixture all the way
rich (clockwise I believe which seems backwards) on the brain.  Then run the
car at the 3000 rpm (or whatever the high rpm limit is) and adjust your
newly exposed adjustment screw.  It is a little touchy, so be patient.
After your high rpm emissions are passing (try to make them pass easily so
you don't have trouble when you do the real test), go back to idle and
adjust the screw on the brain.  Then, just for grins, recheck your high rpm
limit one more time.
        After doing all this, you should be ready to pass smog.  We'll keep
our fingers crossed for you.
