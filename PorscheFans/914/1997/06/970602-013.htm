First off, a frankestein setup like that would never pass in CA. It
would fail on inspection before ever getting to the sniffer. As for
what's wrong, I can't say. But I'm fairly certain that the 009 has alot
to do with it. Also, the 2.0 injectors flow a good bit more fuel than
the 1.8 injectors and will lead to a rich condition right off the bat.
As for the 10# flywheel? Apart from risking a stall every time you let
off the gas with no load, I don't think that it should really have much
of an effect. But I could be wrong.

Anyone else out there have any clue as to how an L/D-jet hybrid like
that might run? If at all?
