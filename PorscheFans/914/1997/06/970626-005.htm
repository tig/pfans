My engine gremlin has been found.  Thwen C. came by last
night for some assistance in installing CV gaskets and 
helped out.

First, cleaning up the engine wasn't a problem - it's been
out of the car twice and only has 600 miles on it since I
completely rebuilt it two years ago.  Hell, you could of
eaten off the front parts of the engine after I mopped up.

With may car without the heating plumbing in place, I laid
down with my head basically under the battery just forward 
and then rearward of the engine carrier.  This provided a 
clear and clean view of the top of the oil pump, the front
seal area, the oil filter flange and upward to the oil cooler
and above.  I was sure the oil came from this area.

After Thwen started the car and the pressure came up it was
*immediately* apparent the leak is coming from the oil filter
flange.  I saw a ooze turn into a run and then drip from the
bottom of the cap for the pressure-relief valve on the passenger
side.  Yelled to have engine shut off and careful investiation
with an extension mirror and a flashlight confirmed that the 
leak was coming from the OIL FILTER FLANGE!

Now what?  I ask myself.  I think I can get the flange off 
without having to move the oil cooler, but it might be tight.
I wonder if the filer may be busted/clogged (but it hasn't run
more than 2 hours) causing backpressure to oooze out the flage?

I don't think the case/flange seal is available separately and
I'm not in the mood to by an entire engine gasket set to fix 
this problem - haven't seen the existing seal to see if it failed.

I'm beginning to entertain the idea of using JB Weld over the oil
filter flage sealing area to cap off the leak - I know this isn't
ideal but it should work.  Alternatively - high temp RTV red silicone
but I don't think I'd take the pressure.

As I find myself in new territory and assume not many others have 
had similar problems - I am completely open and willing to listen
to any wisdom the members of the list can provide.

The good news is that is the only oil leak, the pump area and front
seal area remained dry as a bone and there was *no* evidence of 
leaks from up top.

So, how best to address a leaking oil filter flange seal is the
question of the day!  Any answers?

Relieved in knowing what the problem is.....regards,
