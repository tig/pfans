Bill, can you describe these bubbles? I.e. where they were, how big, etc.

I ask 'cause I once (foolishly) ran my PZeros (205/55ZR16) on the front of
my E12 5-series at absurdly low pressures (18psi? 16psi? 14psi?) because,
quite frankly, they felt pretty good. 

Well, one day I crawled under the car and notice a couple of
half-apricot-sixed (!) bubbles on the inside sidewall (where is says
Pirelli, etc.).  The tires were almost worn out, so I didn't feel too bad
about replacing them. I pumped up the tires to 30psi and drove the car for
a while longer (!) until the bubbles were getting absurdly big (to the size
of a half-lemon, i.e. one cut lengthwise). SO, I cut into the tire with an
X-acto(TM) knife, only to discover that 90% of the belts (I think they're
steel in that part of the tire) were broken due to fatigue, and hence the
rubber in that area had bulged out there for lack of the steel belts
keeping it in shape. This on a car with -3 degrees front camber.

My conclusions were two-fold -- 1) running the tires at that low a pressure
was working the sidewall _way_ too hard, and is not recommended, and 2) I'm
pretty impressed that the tires never blew out despite the
near-catastrophic degradation of the belts in that area.

FWIW, I continue to use PZeros, and typically get 15,000 miles out of a set
on a daily driver w/lots of highway miles (I reduced the camber to -1.5
degrees). They are quite goo din the wet, too. The only problem I have with
PZeros is that they seem rather difficult to balance, and to keep balanced
(so says the shop I use).

PZeros are available in 195/50ZR15 (perfect for 914's) for around $95 per
tire, which I think is a great deal.
