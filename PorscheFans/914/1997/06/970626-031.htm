I think you may have a cyberproblem problem with the server. P-fans is
working fine, and Dirk has been an e-mailin' madman lately. I've been
keeping quiet here because most of my e-mail time lately has been taken
up on the national autox list. Currently engaged in some debate about
new SCCA rules that were just released this month. Also trying, maybe in
vain, to get the 914 reclassed in street prepared from C/SP to D/SP.

I don't think the digest is neccessary on the 914 list as the volume is
sufficiently low. On the 911 list, I'm sure the volume is high enough
that the digest is a better way to go.
