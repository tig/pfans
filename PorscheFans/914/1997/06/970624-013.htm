Does anyone here beside me collect die-cast cars?  Just the other day, I
got a catalog update from one of the mail-order places which had a number
of 1:43 scale die-cast 914's.  Among them were some 914/6 GT's (in '70 LeMans
and Nurburgring livery), and 914/4 targa's.  The manufacturer is Detail Cars,
and while I haven't seen the car in person, I understand the detail is
really good; it's apparently much better than the 914 die-cast that was
re-issued by Porsche/Schuco.  The cars are $28, but there's a 10% break
for 6 or more cars (of each style), up to 20% for 12.  Since I'm going to
getting at least 2 of each for myself, I'm wondering if maybe I can find
some other people on the list that may be interested (Thom, are you
listening? =8^).  I know we've done this for books and things, so I figure
why not for toys?  Anyway, please let me know if you're interested, and
I will try to put something together.  Heck, it'd be a cool toy to have
at your desk when you're bored during the day.....
Oh, there's also some shipping cost too, but that should be minimal given
the size of these things (~3"?).....

Thanks,
Mike
