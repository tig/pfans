Hello folks...

I have just this week purchased a 1970 1.7 914.  It's a great little
car.  It's got an entirely rebuilt drivetrain, with a 2 barrel Holley
carburator.  The frame is intact, and the exterior has a little rust.

For the short term, I plan to set up the car for autocross, time trials,
drivers ed, and for a short commute to work (the commute being definatly
last on the priority list).  For the long term, I would like to attend
wheel to wheel events, and eventually be towing the car.

The first thing I'd really like to do is put on a good suspension.  What
I had in mind are...
Shocks......Bilstein
Springs.....145lbs.
Sways.......Weltmeister ($$$), or Addco (cheaper)

Questions...
Are torsion bars an important componant?
My (limited) thinking is that "the stiffer, the better".  Is this true?
Does having adjustable sways important for the 914?
Am I going to have a sore ass driving to work everyday???

If I have some extra $$$, I'd like to invest in good exhaust.  One thing
I must admit I don't like about these cars (and some older 911s) is the
high pitched scream that comes out of them.  Some of the exhaust
systems  ads say that they produce a nice deep sound with good HP.  The
systems I was looking at were: Burshc, Manta, Sebring Systems(cheap)

Last but not least, I was thinking about replacing the front and rear
bumper sections, and possibly the hood and trunk, with fiberglass.  This
is because of some rust (and weight). Would this be a bad idea as far as
knocking me up in class at autocross and club racing?

Thanks for any info, and any suggestions.
