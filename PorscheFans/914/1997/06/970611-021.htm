I see Dirk and Mike have already replied and explained.  They actually knew
more than I did so I learned something also.  I was just passing on what I
was told about the rear bearings.  With the roll pins they may be fine on
your car.  Like Mike posted though I've never got the outers to easily
separate, either on my original parts car (when disassembling it), on the
spare set of half shafts/stub axles and trailing arms I got with the 5 lug
hubs I got at a swap meet, or on my current car.  It may have to do with
the positioning. The inners are easier to get to.  With the outers inside
the well of the trailing arm you can't do much other than unbolt and try to
pull straight back ( while in the very confined space under the car).

I figured it was worth it for me, cost like $40 to have the mod done while
having some other work done to it.  I'd already planned to remove them
again soon to repack the CV joints and replace the boots.  I'm use to doing
this on the VW Thing where they just have 6 CV bolts, no roll pins,  and
they do separate easily at both ends.
