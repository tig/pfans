For Alan Barrilleaux and other interested parties:

Hi Alan!  You asked:

   Yes, this is do-able, but the sucess rate depends entirely on the condition of the pins and crimp 
joints.  I just went out to the garage and extracted and re-inserted a couple of pins in my old junker 
wiring harness so that I would be up to speed on what we are talking about, and I would say this:
  The tool,  IF IT"S  THE RIGHT TOOL, will be of enormous help.  If it's the wrong tool, it will be of no 
help at all, and may damage the connector pins.  I extracted my pins using a very small alan wrench, 
but I have been an electronics tech for a lot of years, and have developed some feel for Molex type 
connectors.  
  The pins in the Porsche connectors (computer end excluded), are narrow female spade type pins, 
designed to mate with small male spades in the engine-mounted equipment.  They are retained in 
the connector body by means of a small projection which is designed to "rachet' into the hole in the 
connector body.  This projection is on the OPPOSITE side of the female pin from where the split is; in 
other words, on the back.  There is a small square recess molded into the top of the main pin hole in 
the connector to accomodate the extraction tool.  The correct tool for these connectors should be 
square in cross-section, and just big enough to fit into this recess.  It is inserted all the way down until 
resistance is felt, and then a bit more force is applied, and a sort of "over-center" feel should be 
apparent.  This is the ratchet tab being depressed into the pin, allowing removal.  Leave the tool fully 
inserted, and pull the wire out of the shell.  You may have to wiggle it around a bit, but you should be 
able to persuade it to come out.  Don't forget to mark the wires somehow so that you can get them 
back in their correct holes in the connector body.  There is no requirement for this for the injectors; as 
far as I know, they are not polarity sensitive, but the other stuff needs to go back together the same 
way it came apart.
  Which brings me to the pitfalls:  sometimes, due to improper insertion technique or later damage, 
one or more pins simply will not come out of the connector body, no matter what you do.  In this case, 
the only thing to do is to replace with splicing.  Sometimes, the ratchet tab on one or more pins will 
break off.  If this happens, the connector is UNRELIABLE!  The broken pin(s) must be replaced, or 
the whole connector.  Often, the extraction process will bend the ratchet tab down to the point where it 
will not reliably latch back into the connector body when re-inserted.  This too, will result in an 
unreliable connector.  The ratchet tab can usually be bent back up to where it will work again (a 
jeweler's screwdriver is ideal for this purpose), but sometimes the tab becomes weak or breaks off.  
In this case, you are back to splicing. 
The only exception to splicing might be if you can find the original crimp pins somewhere and crimp 
on a new one.  I believe that Dave Darling had a source and part numbers for some of the pins, but 
you will have to ask him.  If you do go this route, be sure that you have the right sort of crimp tool.  The 
wrong tool will either ruin the pins, or make an unreliable joint, or both.

   Subject to the preceding caveats, you may as well try it; it sure makes for a neater installation.  In 
my case, the only boot that I have replaced was on the #4 injector, and the battery acid had so 
damaged the connector and injector that I had to replace them both... I had a devil of a time getting 
the old wire to take solder, even several inches back because of the corrosion wicking up under the 
insulation.  However, in this case, splicing in a new connector was mandatory, and that was what I 
was thinking of when I wrote my earlier piece.

   I hope that this was of some help; please let us know how well it worked out, and if the Radio Shack 
tool is a good one for the purpose, I would be interested in having their stock number for it, and I bet 
the other list members would too.

                                                  Regards,
                                                  Jim T.
