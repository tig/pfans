Yoweee that's hot! It's a wonder we don't have heads full of coked oil! I 
guess I'll have to keep using synthetic in spite of the leaks.

On the 356 Registry home page is an article written by Dennis Jenkinson 
about driving his 356 at high revs and having the oil temperature gauge 
pegged at 140degC! That's about 280degF, is that right?
