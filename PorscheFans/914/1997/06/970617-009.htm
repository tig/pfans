All engines that sit go bad after a few years.  We have engines here that
we know have low miles but we are sure are now  bad!  I would suggest that
you perform a cylinder differential pressure test(an engine leakdown)  This
will tell if the compression is leaking at the head gasket, the exhaust
valve, the intake valve, or by the rings.  Usually if you get the engine
running, it will sometimes blow the crap out and reseal itself.
