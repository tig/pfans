O.K., a brief refresher;  I finished rebuilding the top-end of my '76
2.0 after a dropped valve seat last fall.  The car started on the first
try, but idled close to 3000 rpm, and once warm, would die.  It would
also stumble terribly at any rpm lower than 3000.  I tore my distributor
apart and cleaned it, roughed in the timing, checked every FI
component's resistance, tinkered with the idle fuel mixture, and
replaced almost every hose.  The only thing remaining was to check for
vacuum leaks, and that's where I'm picking up today.

Before I started spraying carb cleaner, I decided to pull my intake
system and inspect it first.  When I got the runners off, I could see a
very thin film of what appeared to be oil on both sides of the plastic
blocks that site between the runners and the heads.  I cleaned these up,
verified that the injectors (new seals all around) were seated properly,
and re-installed everything.  When I started it, I was disappointed to
see that the car was idling at close to 3000 rpm still, but this time,
tinkering with the idle adjustment screw actually had an affect.
Regardless, when set as low as it could go, I was still at 2800 rpms.  I
let the car warm up until the Aux. Air Regulator closed and my oil temp
registered on the gauge.  While doing this, however, I discovered
something by accident.  Simply moving the four wires that run to the
Manifold Pressure Sensor caused the car's behavior to change
dramatically.  As some of you may remember, I had to rebuild the top-end
last year, and that was the one thing I forgot to disconnect before
dropping the motor.  The result was four snapped wires that a mechanic
friend of mine repaired.  Well, I guess they weren't repaired properly.
So, last night, after a quick trip to Radio Shack, I re-repaired the
wires.  The good news is that the car now idles at 1300 when cold (this
is what it used to idle at before the rebuild, so I'm not too
concerned), but it is apparently suffering a rich-running condition.
While idling, small traces of gray smoke are visible at the tail pipe,
but blipping the throttle produces nice-sized gasoline-smelling clouds.
If I hold the rpms up around 3500, nothing is visible from the exhaust.
It's not missing, but it doesn't sound real smooth.  I can't attribute
this to something mechanical, because when the wires were still broken
and I was idling high, there was never any trace of smoke at all.
Here's the weird part;  if I adjust the mixture more rich (clockwise,
right?), then the amount of smoke decreases a little.  I'm at the end of
my rope here, and would appreciate any advice before I get the car towed
to my local p-car shop for a little $55/hr inspection.

Thanks again for everyone's help!
