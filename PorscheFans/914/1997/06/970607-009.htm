Good explanation of the theory of corner balancing.  For a real world example 
of outcome, here are my corner weights without driver (provided by the 
computerized alignment shop):
LF 380 - RF 388
LR 510 - RR 484
The empty car (4 gals fuel) thus has these corner sums:
LF-to-RR 864 - RF-to-LR 898
A very well corner balanced car in the real world.

My 218 pound body gets added thusly:
LF 76 - RF 62
LR 73 - RR 7
This reveals two "duhs" - I sit left of and forward of the center of mass.  
The car with me driving has these corner sums:
LF-to-RR 947 - RF-to-LR 1033
This reveals "duh" number three - I should lose at least 30 pounds!

More interesting to car folks might be that my car's (empty) front-to-rear 
weight bias is 43.6% to 56.4% (tail heavy even by 914 standards).  I like it, 
though, perhaps because I'm excited by oversteer but angry when I get 
understeer.  Personal preference.  

The other point: When my wife is competing, the car is extremely well corner 
balanced.  I would drop off the list (and cease breathing) if I revealed her 
weight, but you could estimate it by subtracting 5 score from my weight.  We 
didn't get data with her in the car, but it's clear the car is better balanced 
for her than for me.

Anybody else got data?
