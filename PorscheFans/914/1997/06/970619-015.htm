This is bad. Although the parts are readily available, doing the job
yourself is not easy. The throttle shafts have ball bearings, which are
realitively easy to replace. The hard part is dealing with the throttle
plates. Each one has 2 screws that are pinged in place. You either have to
take a file or a dremal tool to grind off the protruding end of the screw in
order to back them out. Installation after replacing the bearings is more
tricky. First, each throttle plate was hand adjusted at the factory to match
the others so that they uncovered the progression holes at the same time.
You're going to have to do the same. Also, you're going to have to ping the
ends of the new screws with a special tool you can get (I think) from Weber
(Pierce Manifolds). The hard part is not bending the shaft when you hit it
with a hammer. Obviously, you'll need something on the rear side of the
throttle plate to absorb the blow, but the procedure is tricky, very ticky.
Since these carbs are around one thousand dollars EACH new, you dont' want
to ruin what you have. 

>Thanks much....(looking for a winter rebuild project).

Unless he can prove that the engine has good conpression and leakdown, it
ain't worth much. I'm sure you realize how expensive rebuilding one of these
engines is. But, if you get it, it surly will be a winter (and spring and
summer and fall) project. You could also just use it as a core on a rebuilt
2.0 for 2,500$.
