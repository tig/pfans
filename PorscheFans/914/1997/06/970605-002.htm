	Right.  When you let go the wheel, you have relinquished *all*
control of the car.  You are simply telling it to go where it wants to
go.  Not something to do where there are any large objects (cars, walls,
people, etc.) around to run into.  It almost sounds as if you did this
on the exit of a turn, which is most definitely the wrong thing to do.
It can be OK as a form of spin-recovery, but is still not recommended.
	The car will usually wind up coasting in a direction close to
that which it was originally travelling--but not always.  And it *will*
bang the wheel around prety violently.  As I mentioned, the horn pad has
come off every time I've tried it.

	For tips on hand-positioning during an autoX (and lots of other
good info!), check Hank Watts' book _Secrets_of_Solo_Racing_.  Unless
you need one hand for shifting or signalling, keep both of yours on the
wheel.  If your wrists are sufficiently strong and flexible, you should
be able to not move your hands even when you turn the wheel a full half
turn (180 degrees).  It's easier on a smaller-diameter wheel than the 914
comes with...
	But I digress.
