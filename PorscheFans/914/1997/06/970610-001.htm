On the inner cv's, use a screwdriver between the cv and the transmission
flange to work it free. There are 2 roll pins that have to be worked
loose. On the outer cv's, it may be possible to simply pull real hard
after undoing all of the bolts instead of removing the stub axle. The stub
axle is a 30mm. The way I have done it is to first remove the cotter pin
and put the wheel back on with the center cap removed, then I leave the
weight of the car on the wheel, set the parking brake and put the car in
5th. Then I took a 1/2" drive 30mm socket with a short extension and 
breaker bar "enhanced" with a 3' piece of pipe. With all of my weight on 
the end of the bar, I hit the pipe with a 3# mallet. I'm going to change 
the way I do it in the future by using a 4' piece of angle iron with 2 
holes drilled in it and attach it to the hub with the lug nuts. This will 
provided the reaction to both install and remove the nut. I am also in 
the process of figuring out how to get a puller installed on the hub to 
pressout the stub axle instead of hitting it with a hammer. I want to 
graduate from the "use a bigger hammer" school of mechanics to something 
a little more refined. 

To get the cv off of the shaft, first get the boot unstuck from the cv by 
standing the axle on an end and using a punch and hammer to whack on the 
metal edge of the boot in the axial direction. Once the boot is free, 
take the punch and lightly tap the inner race of the cv. I found this 
makes it a little easier to remove the C clip. Once the C clip is 
removed, the cv may or may not slide off easily. If not, take the trustly 
punch and hammer and tap the inner race from the backside. Be careful not 
to mangle to splines, of course. The inner race should slide smoothly on 
the axle splines.
