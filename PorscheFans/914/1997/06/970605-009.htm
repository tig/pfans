Ah, now that's different, you didn't mention that it was with
competition in mind. So on that note, READ THE RULES.

What class do intend to compete in? Just about any porsche, no matter
how weird and wild, can run in a PCA event. Well, as long as it's
powered by a porsche engine I guess. But PCA has such a varied class
structure that it's nearly impossible to find a class that your car
wouldn't fit in. SCCA is another story entirely.

Why would you have to cut it up? All you're doing is installing an oil
tank for that 3.2L six. :)

Ouch, it'll be alot cheaper to buy a used 2.0 and rebuild it or get it
rebuilt. Take a look at how much that crank or the heads cost. 

Once again, read the rules. All of that will not quite equal a factory
2.0 in the eyes of a rules interpretation. If you're gonna play where
you need a stock motor, use a stock motor. If you win, it'd really suck
to get protested and disqualified.

I don't get it. What's the difference at that point? You've replaced the
heads anyway, how would a factory 2.0 differ from your homebuilt as far
as teh exhaust is concerned? Keep the 1.7 SSIs and get a used 2.0
system. It'll save you alot more money.

If you're going to run with SCCA, you're going to be running against teh
"trailer-riding-fire-breathing" Prepared class cars. The brake calipers
and modified hubs are not allowed in the lower classes. You can get away
with the five lug wheels in Street Prepared -IF- you use a 4 to 5 lug
adapter plate. But you can't modify the hubs for five lug wheels. It's a
stupid rule, but it's a rule nonetheless.

> If so, how fast and competitive are these guys?

VERY! You would run in either C-Street Prepared (sans calipers) or
A-prepared. I can tell you that both of these classes are very fast. CSP
is mostly a CRX/MR2/RX-7 dominated class, but the miatas are starting to
show up in SP and they are blindingly quick. Oh yeah, and the occasional
M3 too. And AP? It's the Louts class. Take your pick, Elan, 7 or Europa,
thy're all hellishly quick cars. Ask Mike Nugent, in his region, he has
to compete against a Lotus Elan that has helped its drivers to 13
national trophies over its history. He can certainly tell you how fast
that car can be. In local competition, if you don't live in Seattle, the
914 might still do well in AP, as AP is an undersubscribed class
compared to CSP (one of the largest).

> I've heard it's a tough league to play in.

It can be. But I feel that tough competition breeds better drivers. And
the competition and drive makes it all the more fun. And the competition
always gets left on the track. The comraderie in SCCA is great, and the
variety of cars is always fun.

My advice on the motor, get a stock 2.0. It'll save you headaches _and_
money.
