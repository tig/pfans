Mark,

You have to remove the panel under the steering rack, and undo the master
cylinder mounting nuts.  Then go back inside the car and disconnect the
throttle & clutch cables, and remove the pedal box assembly.

Now comes the fun part:  removing the pin that holds the clutch pedal to
the shaft.  Once you get that loose, you have to worry about removing the
pedal arm from the shaft itself.  Try penetrating oil, and perhaps use some
heat.  I used my *big* 4lb hammer, and beat the #$%& out of it to get it
loose.

Then clean up the various bushing surfaces with some emery cloth, or a wire
wheel if you have one.  If you're using bronze bushings, lubricate with
oil, not grease.

Have fun.  It's a tedious job, but well worth the 4 hours it took me.

cheers, Brian

Hi 914ers,

On Saturday, Fred and I started to take the squeaky pedal cluster apart 
to install new bushings.

We got everything apart except for the two bolts up against the front of
the chassis which hold the pedal mounting piece to the car. (we got the
other two bolts, further back and vertical, loose easily)

For those who have done this: Do we need to go underneath, open up the
little master cylinder cover, and get these two bolts loose from in there? 

Thanks,

Mark
