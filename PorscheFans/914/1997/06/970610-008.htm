I can't give you the comparison you're asking for, but can relate my
opinion about Yokohama A509's. I put a set (195/60/15) on my 914 early
this year, have autocrossed 3 times on them and have a total of 6000
miles on them to date.  So far, I'm VERY impressed with them.  One
driving instructor (and fellow 914 racer) at a PCA event even commented
that "for street tires, these are really responsive".  I suspect that at
the rate I'm going the tires will need to be replaced at around 15,000
miles, but that's not bad considering they'll have 15-18 autocrosses on
them by that time.

Just my opinion.
