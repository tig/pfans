I was wondering if anyone could give me some suggestions as to
procedures for getting some welding done on the rocker panels on my 914.

I picked up my 914 this weekend, and spend the rest of it removing the
interior and uncovering the rust that exists.

It's worse on the passenger side, right around the jack stand post. 
There's about a 4" hole in the floorboard as well.

What I've heard about is a clam shell kit that gets welded around the
rocker, and the price for that kit is $300 (Automobile Atlanta). 

I'm going to track it, so it's got to be safe.  Also, I'd like to know
the car isn't going to rust out from under me.

Any bodyshop recommendations and experiences in New Jersey/New York
would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Sam Matthews
