By any chance are the rear inner pads wearing faster than the rear outers?
I had the parking brake mechanism in my rear calipers go sticky on me one
time - the cable was free, but the pivoting lever on the caliper was sticky.

I actually carried a large screwdriver around with me & would pry the darn
thing back when I wanted to 'un-park'.  Made for some interesting situations
when doing that solo & parked on an incline...  Used to stick a wheel chock
under the driver's side front, pop the parking brakes, hop in, fire it up,
ease forward & lean out the door to pick up the chock.

It finally eased up to the point it would work Ok and I didn't have to do
that anymore.  Car's down for a rebuild now & will get new or rebuilt rear
calipers, assuming I can find 'em when I finally get around to putting it
back together.
