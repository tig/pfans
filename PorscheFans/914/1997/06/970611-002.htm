Matt,

_front brakes_

check your rotors for wear, big grooves, etc while you're in there. 

Use never-seize *sparingly* on the pad retaining pin where it touches the
pad.  Use never-seize *sparingly* on the top & bottom edges of the pad
backing plate where it touches the caliper.  

Pry the pistons back with a suitible tool.  If your m/c reservoir is full,
then draw some out with a turkey baster first because when your retract the
pistons, it forces fluid back up in the system, and you'll make a big mess.

Clean all the parts that are to be re-used.  Scrape off the top & bottom
inside edges of the caliper, where the pads ride.  clean the pad retaining
pins & springs.  Use a *very small amount* of never seize on the retaining
pins where they touch the holes in the pads, and use a *very small amount*
of never seize on the spreader spring where it touches the pads.  Just a
thin smear is all you'll need.

When you've got the wheels back on, _before_ you drive the car, sit in the
car and immediately pump the pedal up & down until the pads "self-adjust."

_rear brakes_
Very similar to front brakes, but use the 4mm allen key to retract the
pistons.  

The outer one, loosen the 13mm jam nut and turn the 4mm screw.  You'll see
the piston move.  Make sure you *retract* the pistons, so check to see if
you're turning it the right way.  

The inner piston requires a long 4mm allen key, or my favorite, a 4mm allen
key 1/4" dr socket that you can put an extension on.  First remove the 4mm
"cover plug" and then retract the piston in the same manner as the outer
one.

Clean the caliper/pad contact surface, and check your e-brake
operation--cable should slide freely.

When pads are installed, set the rear clearance using the retracting
screws.  I forget the spec, it's in the hayne's manual.  You can use a
feeler gauge, or just set them until you can just "hear" the pads brush the
rotor when you spin it.  You shouldn't be able to feel the pads drag, just
"hear" them rub a bit when you spin the rotor.  Don't forget to replace the
inner plug (use a touch of never-seize on the threads) and lock the outer
13mm jam nut (not *too* tight, it won't go anywhere!)

Then bed your pads in for 50-70 miles of city driving or 100-150 miles of
highway driving before you use them hard.

Never-seize, copa-slip, anti-seize compounds will be availible at your
FLAPS (Friendly Local Auto Parts Store)

You don't really have to bleed your brakes, but if the m/c fluid isn't
clean (ie looks black-ish) flushing the system at this time is a good idea.
 I do a brake flush once a year--fluid is cheep, rebuilding calipers is a
hassle.
