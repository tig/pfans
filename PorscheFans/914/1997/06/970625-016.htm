I've been poking around on the state gov sites.  SB42, the 25 year and
older exempt smog bill was approved by the assembly transportation
committee on 6/16 but referred back to the appropriations committee.
Probably because the state will lose some money from the smog certificates
for 66 to about 72-73 cars that go exempt.  They estimate about 200k cars
in this range and more each year as it slides forward.

There is some concern on other lists I'm on that this will get rolled into
a big Smog II revision law that may be coming. Not good for it passing.
I've emailed Senator Kopp (the bill author) and copied my state senator and
assemblyman.  Saying I didn't' want it rolled into a larger bill and
buried.  Sounds like Kopp wants to keep it separate also.

One interesting thing was the list of opposition. The following was
forwarded to me by someone else checking into this:

   Air Quality Products, Inc.
   California Air Resources Board
   Department of Consumer Affairs
   Western States Petroleum Association

   Notice the fourth entry?  They were not there before.  WSPA is a
   powerful (read 'rich') lobbying group who have contributed millions
   (read 'bribed') to politicians to see things go their way.  Also note
   that CARB has trotted out some fallacious statistics regarding
   failure-rates of older vehicles (most fail the visual inspection and are
   therefore never checked for emissions) and quantities of emission
   products -- based on a certain number of 'gross-pollutor' vehicles each
   driving 12,000 miles per year.




Check out the Senate and Assembly web sites.  Write your CA officials if
you want this to have a chance.  Tell them to keep it a separate bill and
to pass it.

Until the current inhabitants of the "Dumb Dome" adopt the legislation.
