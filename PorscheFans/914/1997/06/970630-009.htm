The reason I picked the 175/70 as the base tire size is that is the size 
PCA uses for its reference as stock size. The 175 was an optional size and 
we all know it was an 80 series, but it was not marked as 80 so the default 
of 70 series is used.
Given that a stock -4 2.0l runs against 911-T's and 924's it is a little 
bit of help, but we need a lot.

BTW- I came in third on a shorten race at Summit point this weekend. 
Positions were:

1- 911T (Bill Kellner) Good car & good driver
2- 914 (Sam Low) Very well setup car
3- 914 (Me)
4- 924 (Ed Moore)
5- 911T (Mike Melton)

A 944 balled up in the chute and they shut us down at 7, but I was reeling 
the upper two in, and they were head to toe, maybe I could have got them 
maybe not.

I get 137.04 revs/mi for 195/60, and 132.26 revs/mi for 175/70, which works
out to the 195/60 tire rotating 3.61% faster than the 175/70 tire. The
195/55 was about 10% faster, and the 195/50 was 18% faster.

When you add a row in Excel and do a copy & paste, you have to change the
formula for the "delta different" column to refer back to the oem row.
