I think Corroless from Eastwood is probably a safer choice than POR-15,
since POR-15 is an isocyanide. Corroless is a combination rust converter and
primer. POR-15 apparently does not stick to unrusted metal, meaning that you
have to prime over it before top coating. Eastwood also has a heavy duty
cavity wax for enclosed areas. Hirschman sells "Miracle Paint" that is
apparently a rust converter and paint combination. They also have several
other usefull products as well, like a couple of high temp paints, gas tank
sealant, etc. They are in Hemmings. 

Of course, the best way to deal with rust it to remove as much as possible
before relying on these "treatments." But, you knew that already, right? :)

Hey, somebody's go to take up the bandwidth around here. It's been awful
quiet lately. Maybe everyone's cars are finally working.....nah.
