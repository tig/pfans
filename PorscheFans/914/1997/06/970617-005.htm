Well, we sold the hyundai to a FOB (Fresh Off the Boat) egyptian last night.
Nice guy, but not knowlesgable about cars. (sometimes that's good). I got
1,700$ for it, which is a fair price considering that the AC didn't work,
the outer cv boots are torn, it needs a muffler, the brakes are marginal,
and the clutch chatters. I was hoping for 2g's, but the value of these cars
is dropping like a rock, so I wanted to bail out ASAP. 

He brought a friend with to look the car over, then we went to his friends
apartment for tea. Then he went to get another friend to look the car over.
They all drove the car and looked it over closely. Then back to the
apartment for more tea. Then they pissed me off by asking for another 100$
off for the muffler. We got up to leave and they backed off and agreed to
1,700$. Since this guy was completely unfamiliar with US laws, we wanted to
make sure that the title was officially transferred into his name. So, all 5
of us went to the DMV at the local shopping mall, which was open until 9:30
at night. After about 3/4 hour of standing in line, the deed was done and we
all shook hands and smiled and went home. They sure talked a lot. This must
be the custom in Eqypt and the rest of the middle east. Invite the seller in
for some tea, butter him up, haggle over the price, complete the
transaction. Man, that sure was time consuming. But, who else are you going
to sell an old hyundai to? He had 17 one hundred dollar bills, so I was
willing to put up with all the other stuff to get cash. 

Now it's time to test my daily driver/classic car philosophy. I wanna a buy
a 912 someday, too. The more classic/valuable cars I have the better.

I'm getting married on Friday (JP), and going on a short weekend honeymoon.
We'll pay for it with money from the hyundai sale (and have a bunch left
over, of course). The rest is going into our only running car, the BMW 2002.
I've got a hot date with my bodyman in a couple of weeks. My daughter is
coming up over the July 4th week (a really big holiday around here
(Wash.,DC)). Lots of things going on all at once. 

I'm going to get my bumpers painted body color (Zambezi Green). I've been
dreaming of green bumpers lately,...strange.

Dirk
