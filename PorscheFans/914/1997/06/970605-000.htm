Josh,thanks for the reply. I realize that you are correct about the 914 out
performing
most vehicles in its class in turns, autocross etc.. And I would like to be
able to keep
it legal and competitive in PCA autocross and track events. I've toyed with
the idea of
an engine swap, but my car is too nice to start cutting up. My other thoughts
 are to 
upgrade my 1.7L to 2.0 specs. I figure 2.0L rods, crank, p&c, big valve 1.7L
heads, and machine case. Stock cam and F.I. with 2.0 injectors are a must as
I've always hated the motors with carbs on the street. Is this a wise choice?
I would rather modify my 1.7 to retain my SS heat exchangers and F.I. set up
than find a 2.0 to rebuild. 
On another subject, my car is currently being fitted with steel GT flares,7&8
x 15
Fuchs, front sway bar, 320 brake calipers and possibly the 2.0L F.I. motor.
Am I
going to have to run in modified SCCA classes? I've never competed in SCCA
before
and I'm not familiar with their rules. If so, how fast and competitive are
these guys?
I've heard it's a tough league to play in.
Thanks,
Ed Villela
