Nothing against nifty gadgets, but there's an easier way to install rear =
wheel bearing, having just done it.  Put them in the freezer for a while =
(days), mine were in there for months, but that was just because it took =
me that long to get to them.  This shrinks them enough that they just =
dropped right in.  Lube the bores in the trailing arm first.  I did give =
them a couple of taps with the big ole pipe I used to knock the old ones =
out, just to make sure they were in all the way.
