If it's just the window and not the door, then it may just be an adjustment
on the window mechanism. Someone told me about how they adjust doors at the
Porsche factory. Imagine a big husky guy with a sledgehammer and a 2x4. Take
the the butt end of the 2x4 and put it against either the top or bottom
hinge part that is bolted to the body. Whack the other end of the 2x4 with
the sledge and bend the body slightly. He said the car in the video was a C4
Turbo. That's hand craftsmanship in action for you!

Yeah, but you gotta do the ice pick (or equivalent pointy tool thingy) test.
