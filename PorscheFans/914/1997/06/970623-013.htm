Mike,

Sounds like a cold start valve...very common with the 914 every 40-50k
miles.  It sits on top of the engine...about a 10 minute replacement, and
yes, a VW replacement works just fine.  Very std complaint...car
stutters, or stops after it gets warm, yet seems fine upon initial start.

Hope this fixes it.  Jim C.
