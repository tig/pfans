  I, too ran into the lockup problem, but I spent some time on the problem, and believe I have an 
answer.  I am able to dis-assemble and re-assemble CV joints so that they are either locked or 
normal, more or less at will.  I got good at it practicing on a VW joint that someone had tried to cobble 
onto my 914 (don't bother trying it, the roll pins don't fit and you will break the bolts), and I believe that 
I have the secret.  
  I will try to describe it, but if my description isn't understandable, then you can send me the joint, and 
I will try to free it up for you and send it back.

  The description in the Haynes book is correct, but by showing the joint edge-on, they have so 
obfuscated the issue that I had to discover what they were driving at by trial and error.  When I finally 
figured it out, I painted my old VW joint with white-out and put it on my copy machine.  I have pasted 
the result into my Haynes book over the original picture.  It shows the end position of the internals 
when correctly assembled, and with this goal in mind, the initial alignment and rotation can be left to 
the mechanic.
  
   The trick is that if you place the center of the joint (which has the splined hole for the half-shaft) flat 
side down on your bench, you will observe that there are projections which create the boundries 
between the machined grooves in which the balls ride.  These projections alternate in width at the 
outer periphery: wide, narrow, wide, narrow, wide, narrow.
  Similarly, the outer part of the CV joint, when laid down flat on your bench, will be observed to also 
have projections toward the center which form the boundaries between the grooves machined for 
the balls.  These projections also alternate wide, narrow around the inner periphery of the outer 
housing.  These changes in width are due, of course, to the fact that the ball grooves are not straight, 
but angled with respect to the axis of the half-shaft.
  Now, the trick:  When assembled, the projections on the inner and outer parts must face each other 
in such fashion that opposite types are opposite each other.  In other words, a wide projection on the 
inner hub must be opposite a narrow projection on the outer housing.  A narrow projection on the 
inner hub must be opposite a wide projection on the outer housing.  If the joint is assembled thus, it's 
inner hub will tilt and slide freely in and out with respect to the outer housing.  If it is assembled in the 
opposite manner, that is, wide projections opposite each other, and narrow projections opposite 
each other, it will still be possible to assemble the joint by rotating the hub and cage into the outer 
housing, but when so assembled, the inner hub and the outer housing will form a rigid assembly, 
capable of neither reciprocal nor angular motion.

  If you try hard enough, you should be able to start dissassembly by rotating your ball cage out of 
co-axiality with the rest of the assembly.  The hub should be able to follow somewhat.  You will need 
to use a moderate amount of force (only what you can apply with your hands, no tools) as the joint is 
somewhat more difficult to move in the incorrectly assembled position, but it should be possible.
  Once you get it apart, be sure to maintain the orientation of the pieces that I described above as 
you put it together, and you should have a working joint.

                                                  Good Luck,
                                                  Jim T.
