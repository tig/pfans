I have been told that my 71 sounds like it has a head leak somewhere, 
which would explain the 85-20-0-0 compression reading, and it dying on 
idle once it warms up. The confusing thing is that it just doesn't seem 
to be missing on 2 1/2 cylinders when it is running. I have also been 
told that you have to drop the engine to properly check for leaks. Is 
this true? And does anyone know of a reasonably priced 914 mechanic in the 
Oakland/SF area? 

Thanks!
