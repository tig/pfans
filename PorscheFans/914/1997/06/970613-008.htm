Use flare nut wrenches to remove the brake lines. Sears has a set for 20
bucks. It sounds like you've got a stuck piston. You'll have to take the
caliper off, of course, and use pliers or something to grip the end of the
piston to wiggle it free. Also penetrating oil under the dust seal helps a
bunch. Don't split the calipers unless they are leaking at the seam. Just
replace the O rings, seals and dust boots (after removing the rust from
the ends of the bores or course). You might have to work the allen wrench
and pliers at the same time to get it out. The pistons have a female
threaded insert inside them that connects to a male threaded member that
is in turn actuated by the allen key. Unless the two parts are completely
unthreaded (the piston is sticking way far out), you'll need to use the
allen tool to help get it out. Also, one piston is left hand thread and 
the other is right hand, as I recall (or was I dreaming?).
