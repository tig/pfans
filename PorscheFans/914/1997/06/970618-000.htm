They all drove the car and looked it over closely. Then back to the
apartment for more tea. Then they pissed me off by asking for another
100$
off for the muffler. We got up to leave and they backed off and agreed
to
1,700$.

must
be the custom in Eqypt and the rest of the middle east. Invite the
seller in
for some tea, butter him up, haggle over the price, complete the
transaction. Man, that sure was time consuming.

Dirk,

That IS the custom there. I spent most of last summer in Egypt (the
Sinai peninsula) as a flight surgeon to support the MFO there. I was
able to make it to some of the tourist towns while there to pick up some
some jewelry and perfume on the local economy. Gold and perfume are
really cheap there. Haggling is the rule and a pass-time there. They
chat with you, bring out cokes while you banter over price. There's
always a sales clerk along with the shopkeeper and all get involved in
the transaction. Meanwhile they ask you where in the U.S. you are from,
what you do, etc. None of my purchases was made in less than a 1/2 hour.
It reminded me of day trips to Tijuana  when I lived in San Diego.

Congrats on the wedding. Hope the weekend goes well ;).

Gary.
