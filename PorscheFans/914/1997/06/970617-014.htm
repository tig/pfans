I've been meaning to ask the same type of thing myself that Mike asks
below.  In my project car the very top of the window on the drivers side
rubs on what is left of the seal along the front of the rollbar.  I was
wondering if the doors can be out of alignment and readjusted rather than
the problem being body sag?

My previous 914 that I bought as a parts car had sever rust out and I saw
it all in the process of stripping it.  This car seems solid.  It has what
looks like a original undercoating.  No visible rustout in the places where
I can see under the undercoating, in fender wells etc.  Both jack points
look solid, I haven't pulled out the rocker panels yet but when had rear
wheels removed I could look under the fender and see the jack point through
there.  I see the original blue paint, no sign of rust on the jack point
tube.

There is some surface rust visible behind the firewall pad and down under
the battery, etc.  I'll be removing the interior, engine, etc later on and
will be checking and dealing with the surface rust and looking for
surprises but nothing obvious yet.  And since the drivers door seems to rub
more than the passenger though the passenger is typically the worst?  I
don't know.

Both doors are missing the weather seals around the bottom of the door and
the matching one on the body but I don't think these would affect the door
position?

Oh, and for those who have seen me mention that some PPO painted the
original Alaska Blue Metallic to something Icalled fuschia.  Look at a box
of Kellogg's Raisin Bran with the NASCAR drivers on it.  The top part of
the box is the shade of my car.

Okay; I've asked this question in various guises before, but since someone
else brought it up this time, I'll feed the fire.....

I'm working with a '73 that's being converted to a 6.  I've inspected for
rust, and I've found some in the engine shelf, and lower outer rear
firewall (near the control cables); the firewall area was patched by a PO.
The inner rockers (and even the jack plates, believe it or not, though
they've split due to imporper jacking) do not appear to have any rust.
This, with vigorous rapping/testing with a screwdriver.  However, when I
jack up the side of the car on the rear "donut" under the car (both wheels
off the ground, top off), an ~1/4" gap opens up between the window glass
(up), and seal.  I can open and close the door normally whether the car is
jacked up or sitting on the ground.  The car drove fine, and seemed
reasonably stiff (it have heavy springs/shocks on it) while the car was
still running (before I took it apart).

I've been told by various people both that the car should not "open" at all
when being jacked up (zilch, nada, zip), and that a little amount is okay
(it is a targa afterall, and 911's do the same).  I'm not sure who to
believe, and I've never tested a brand new 914 myself to know....  So the
possibility exists that there may be some sag in my car.  I'm interested in
getting reinforcing rockers and a GT-type rear stiffening kit, but only if
I can put it on myself, and without screwing up the car (assume that I am a
competent MIG welder).

Is the amount of deflection I am seeing normal, or is reinforcing the
chassis necessary (I'm leaning towards it anyway).  Everyone seems to say
that only a competent body shop should be installing these parts, but I'm
not willing to pay the labor rates I've been quote to do this.  Surely
there must be *someone* out there who has tried to do this at home?  I'd
like to hear what the results were, and any tips/suggestions!

It seems the biggest stumbling block is jigging up the car.  I don't have a
Dataliner, nor do I have access/plan to acquire one.  I do have the factory
manuals, and see the dimensions/plans for the door jig.  Assuming I fab up
the door jig, are there any other dimensions I need to contemplate while
doing the reinforcement?  Since mine appear to be intact, I'd want to weld
new plates on top of the existing rockers, rather than cut them out and
replace them. This should make the work easier, but it can't be as simple
as just fitting up the new plate and then welding into place, can it?

Oh, and Don has suggested stitchwelding the existing seams/spot welds.
That's a good idea, and I'll probably be doing that at some point during
this conversion.


Thanks,
Mike
