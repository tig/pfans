Ron, you want some inexpensive tires that are autocross-able?

Try Yokohama A509 195/60/15.  They are street tires with a soft rubber
compound and an aggressive tread design.  You can get them for about $67
each.  I've had mine for 3 months now and (counting my wife's win in
class I-1-L at the 1997 Porsche Parade!) have done 8 autocrosses on them
and have put a total of about 5000 miles on them.  They are starting to
show some wear - mostly around the edges, but are still in excellent
condition and I expect to get another year's worth of daily use (est.
15k miles) and at least another 15 autocrosses out of them.

I agree with the others;  there is no comparison between a street tire
(ANY street tire) and an autocross or roadrace tire, but at about half
the price of an R1 or A032 or 008RSII, they'll give a lotto bang for the
buck.  Sheese!  If you're running on 165 tires now, ANY wider,
lower-profile tire will seem like magic to you!
