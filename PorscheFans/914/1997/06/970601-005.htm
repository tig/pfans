I've got a '74 914 2.0 which had decent brakes although the pedal has
been a bit springy ever since I got it (about 2 years).  Irecently
acquired a parts car for some engine bits, but decided to replace the
right rear caliper on my car because I noticed the handbrake  would
stick on sometimes.  Since the swap I've had problems with the brake
pedal rising up until the brakes drag all the time.  I've tried putting
the original caliper back on and bleeding out the system to flush any
contaminants possibly introduced by the other caliper, all to no
effect.  The pedal still rises and retreats according to its own
desire.  All the wheels spin freely when it is cool in my driveway, but
once on the road the pedal creeps back up and I can feel it dragging.  I
have also noticed that when I push the pedal down all the way and
release it, I can hear a sort of click noise from the area of the
proportioning valve.  can it be that the new caliper put some sort of
stress on an old, weakened proportioning valve and pushed it over the
edge?  I can't think of what else it could be.
