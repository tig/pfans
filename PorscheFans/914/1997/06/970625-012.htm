Mike,

I did this stuff about 3 months ago.  If you have the Weltmeister
swaybar mounting kit you don't have to do any welding.  The original
swaybar mount was welded to the OUTside of the inner fenderwell (so the
dealers didn't have to remove the gas tank I suppose), but the
Weltmeister one has a pair of plates that 'sandwich' the fender wall
between them and are also a much heavy guage metal.  Also included in
the kit is a template to show you where to drill the holes.  You'll have
to drain and remove your gas tank to do it so you'll want a friend to
help out.  Installation is pretty straight forward, but watch out for
the wires running along the inside side of the fender well on the
driver's side - you can hit them when you drill the holes and sparks
will fly everywhere (I speak from experience here).  Also make sure your
A-arms have the U-tab on them for the droplinks.  If not, you'll have to
attach some somehow.  Be sure to seal the metal that you drilled for the
installation otherwise you'll start rusting there!

As far as the turbo tie-rods go, its a bitch of a job getting the old
ones loose and getting the new ones on good and tight (we're talking the
steering box end here), but you'll notice the difference in the
responsiveness of the steering.  Even if your old tie-rods ends aren't
shot to hell, the rubber joints in the tie-rods themselves probably are.
 When you're done, you'll need to set your toe in.  When I did mine, I
also removed both A-arms so I could install new suspension bushings.  I
don't know if having them still on the car will interfer with the
installation of the tie-rods.

Good luck!
