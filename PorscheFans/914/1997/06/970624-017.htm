Howdy 914'ers, 

 Im one of the Lucky ones to have gotten one of Stans Combo gauge kits.
Stan only did a short run of them and got out, What im trying to say is,
if you think you might want one of these gauges, Get it now before there
gone, but then again you can have Hollywood speedo make you one for
$750.00.

 I have gone to the web page that Stephen talked about, but I cant open
the first picture ??(the face) If you cant either, I have had a picture
of the gauge scaned in and I can email it to you.

 Dont let this pass you buy,

 Don
