OK, I've done this. I soaked them in kerosene (use a parts washer if
have one handy), and scrubbed them with a tooth-brush size
wirebrush. I did not dissassemble them! I tried that on one cv and
when I put it back together, it was frozen solid - now I can't get
it apart. Anyway, I work the joint to remove all the old grease with the =

wire brush and kerosene (I like kerosene because it's cheap and
relatively harmless), then finish up with brake cleen. Repacking
is tricky without the special grease gun attachments. I would extend
the joint axially in one direction, work the grease into all recesses,
then extend the joint in the other direction and repeat unitl it was
fully greased. I found that you can't just squish grease into the
joint from one side - important parts won't get greased.
