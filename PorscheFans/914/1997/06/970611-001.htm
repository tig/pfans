Nine-fourteeners:

I've recently found a very clean 914 for sale in 
Vancouver, BC

*appearance*
- white 1973 2.0 FI paint is excellent, but original
colour was "puke green."  The interior & trunks 
& engine compartment are black.  Door jambs 
are white.  Very nicely done.
- adjustible konis
- weltmeister short shift kit
- 2.0 fuchs wheels
- bra
- funky fiberglass front spoiler
- center console, smooth door panels & dash face
- aftermarket mirrors
- chrome bumpers
- stereo w/ speakers in doors :(

*mechanicals*
- The engine has an "oil trap" reservoir and also leaks
oil from the pushrod tubes, bellhousing area and oil
cooler area. 
- The clutch is just beginning to slip (due to oil)

- The heat-X are all rusted away on driver's side, 
passenger side is ok.  Aftermarket single-outlet
exhaust--quite loud.  There is a possible exhaust
leak, and I couldn't hear the valves "tick" so it's 
either hydraulic, or *way* out of adjustment.

- He has 3 new injectors in the engine.

- Spares include original side mirrors, 2 rear calipers
& broken speedo


I saw the car with a "for sale sign" and checked it
out.  What a beautiful car.  I only weigh 1/3 what 
BB Dave weighs, but the doors open & close quite
nicely with the roof off--ie glass doesn't stick, etc.

If anyone is interested, lemme know, and I can go 
back and check it more closely--under the battery,
jack up a corner & check gaps, etc.  I didn't test
drive the car, as it was out of my price range ($5300 US
or $7500 CDN) and it was dinnertime.

Please e-mail the owner directly, as I have no "interest"
in this car other than doing a favor for the owner, as the
body is very nice--quite a bit nicer than my own :(
