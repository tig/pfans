I thought of something last night, so I thought I'd run it through the
expertise of the list before I do more damage to my car.  When I
reassembled my exhaust (Stainless exchangers with a Bursch exhaust)
after having my heads rebuild by MSHP, the driver's side exchanger was
about 1/2 in too far to the left.  I loosened the exchanger a little,
shifted it so it matched, and put the bolts into the exchanger through
the exhaust.  Then, I re-tightened the exchanger (15 ft/lbs).  Now, even
though everything is tight, I'm sure that I don't have a very good seal
between the head and the exchanger.  Since I don't have access to any
equipment that would let me gently bend my exchanger, I thought of
another idea.  What if I either filed the top of the exchanger at an
angle, or filed the copper gasket at an angle?  Is this a bad idea?

Thanks for your help,
