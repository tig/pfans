Sounds great! I'll give 'em a call.

I have already replaced all of those nasty screws with M6 allen head
screws. They're ALOT easier to remove and install than those stupid
cheese heads.

I'm more concerned with removal. Any anti-sieze that is applied during
instalation will have long since burned off when time comes around to
pulling the header off at a later date. That's where my main concern is.
I thought of zincing (silver's too expensive) the nuts, but the zinc'll
probably be gone too after baking on there for however long.
