Last night was the first time in over a week that I worked on my car. I =
was sick part of last
week and I'm still getting over it.

Anyway, that rear wheel bearing install tool I made works great - piece =
of cake.
I got the other bearing in last night clean and square. Anyone local that=
 wants
to borrow it is welcome to contact me. (I'm in northern viriginia)

I also pulled the coil overs and to my amazement the towers were as clean=
 and rust
free as brand new. So out came the mild solvent, paper towels, and underc=
oating to
make sure they stayed nice and rust free. You know - it's funny the way =
undercoating
falls back on your face and neck when you spray the stuff upwards (that's=
 not raisins
stuck in my teeth dear, that's undercoating!).

Hey, does anyone know if I need a spring compressor to get stock springs =
off of the
shocks? I'd read somewhere that some springs didn't require them, so I'm =
hoping
someone can kick loose that memory fragment for me.

I could use some hints on exhaust stud removal, mine are like bonded to =
the head.
I have some stainless steel ones just jumping to get in there, but they =
have to wait
unitl the old ones come out. I tried liquid wrench and the two nut method=
, but when
I went to back out the inner nut and it started turning and nothing else =
was turning,
I figured something was up, so I quit before I busted it. I was planning =
on getting the
Snap-On stud extractor tool, but I'm not sure if it'll fit up in the area=
 where the studs
are located. I haven't tried heating the head yet, but it may be my next =
imperitative.

I'm thinking about getting a '66-'69 912. Anyone have any experience with=
 them?
No, I'm not getting rid of my 914, I just want another car, and I dont' =
think I fit into
a beetle (I'm 6'3", 210#), BMW bavarias are too complex and the parts are=
 either
too expensive or hard to get, VW squarebacks are also hard to get some =
parts
for, and I dont' want a modern front driver or an american car. I don't =
want
another 2002 either. I can't afford a 911, 944 or 928, and I have too muc=
h
pride to drive a 924. I like funky and simple air cooled cars (not VW bus=
es).
I think corvairs are too old to drive daily also. Anyway, thanks for list=
ening.

Working on cars is good therapy. Gives me a nice peaceful easy feeling. =
