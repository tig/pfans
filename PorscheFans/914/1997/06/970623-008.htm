Naturally, while I am in the middle of putting Longitudinal
reinforcements on my '75 2.0, my son comes up with a real headscratcher
electrical glitch on his '73 1.7: His alternator light is coming on when
the engine is revved over 2400 rpm, unless you have the headlights on; I
have cleaned the fuse box contacts, substituted for the voltage
regulator (twice), pulled and checked the relay board, (contacts already
soldered), cleaned the battery connections, checked the connections at
the starter solenoid(new within the last year). If you hot lead the "DF"
connector from the alternator with battery voltage, the light doesn't
come on, but the small gauge jumper that I used got extremely hot in
about 2 minutes. (As I understand it this is stimulating the field coil
in the alternator to max output). This,  and the puzzeling fact that the
alternator light does not come on when the lights are on leads me to
believe that the alternator is good, and I suspect a bad ground or
faulty connection somewhere, but where? Please help so that I can get
back to the significantly greater pleasure of working on my own car.

storage.*
