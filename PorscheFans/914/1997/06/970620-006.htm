Yes what a car, they produced one in steel then sold it as a in
fiberglass kit.  The kit was recalled, and I know of only one kit that
was installed.  It is owned by a local, who uses it for a fun SCCA auto-x
car.  This one is painted "Fly Yellow" that nice bright Ferrari color.  I
like people who drive bright yellow cars, helps keep my car cleaner as
they attract every bug in the county. <g>

 The original was up for sale a few years ago, I remember the asking
price was set at 36,000 for the car. Both cars BTW, where featured in
European Car at some point in time.  I have both articles if someone
really wants to see these, they are a very nice design, and the original
had flawless craftsmanship, good indicator to the capabilities of Beach
Boys Racing.

Take care,
