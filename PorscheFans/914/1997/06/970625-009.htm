Dirk,

	It is very common to squeeze 205s onto the 5.5" rim. But not all wheels
will allow the 205 to fit under the stocks fenders. The Fuchs are pretty
much the only ones that have the propper backspacing to allow the tire
to fit. Most of the aftermarket wheels have too little backspacing.

Then you should see what my 225/50-14s look like! >:-) <insert

165 was the technology of the early 70's. Modern tire construction can
allow much wider tires on narrow rims. Not that narrow rims are best,
wider is always better, but more tire = more stick. Plain and simple.
