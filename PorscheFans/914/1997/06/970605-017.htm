Hey Dirk, you got any pics of the tool? I almost broke down and bought
automashin's tool, but decided that I do my rear bearings so
infrequently, that it may not be worth it.

And they were clean? Dirk, you're obviously not leaking enough oil. :)
You're spraying undercoating on the shocks? Why?

Stock springs yes. But most of the non-stock upgrade springs do not
require compression. Especially if you plan to lower the car.

Penetrating oil, patience, penetrating oil, patience, and so on. Heating
the heads may work, or freezing the studs.

Stainless huh? On the plus side, there wouldn't be much in the way of
corrosion worry anymore. On the down side, the thermal expansion of SS
is much less than that of normal steel. I havn't dug out my machinists
handbook, but I'd suspect a remote possibility of the studs loosening as
the heads heat up.

'Might be too late already. I hope not.

Not personally, but I can say that they are a worthwhile investment. And
I do mean _investment_. They are not going to be cheap. As a matter of
fact, it'll cost more than a good 914. And parts are expensive. But they
are beautiful cars. And they've got the SWB chassis, so it'll be a great
little autoxer. And some of the best autoxing P-cars out there are 912s.
I know of an absolutely pristene 912 in the bay area. BRG (brittish
raceing green) and polished fuchs. Pretty little car.

If you can't afford a 944, then you can't afford a 912. A 944 (not turbo
or S2 model) can be found for fairly cheap.

How bout a Saab? Maybe an old 99 model. I think some of them had the
ford V-4 motor, and a 4-on-the-tree freewheel transmission. You want
funky, THAT'S a funky car. Looks like a snail.
