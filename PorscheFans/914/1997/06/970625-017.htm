I have a set installed they came with the car.  But I have driven others
and the difference is very minor.  I think a lot of the folklure comes
from people changing the rods when they really needed to change tie-rod
ends anyway.

>Thanks for the tips,

You can bolt them in or weld them in.  I prefer the weld in process, you
have to take the tank out each way.  But if you weld it in, you never
have to take the tank out again to change the swaybar, bushings or what
ever.  Also if the bolts back out, the plate will start to move and start
to tear the holes open.  I know it is a minor risk, but I have seen bolts
back out under stress.  I prefer to overbuild a car, and keep it light
than underbuild a car, and have it fail at the wrong time.

Take care,
