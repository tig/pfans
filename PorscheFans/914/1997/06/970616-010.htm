	Uh, no. If you're reading an email and it seems overly long
	for you, please hit the delete key and skip to the next one.
	I don't own a 914 but I read the 914 list because I'm interested
	in the car and  all the posts, not just the short ones. In fact,
	the most informative/interesting posts are often the longest ones.
	If people did as you ask, the lists would rapidly disintegrate
	to a bunch of yes/no replies with the good posts only going to
	one or two people through private email. Lots of people get
	good advice before they actually need it this way, i.e. they
	don't have to ask their question because they read someone's
	long post on the subject 2 months earlier. Just use the delete
	key.
