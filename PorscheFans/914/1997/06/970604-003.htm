Rickydick has an original Speedster?

Yeah, a 1915 Ford Model T with not even a windshield.
It has nothing but hood and firewall, bucket seats, a fuel tank
and trunk above the floor.

In case you hadn't noticed, I have fallen quiet on the 914
lists in the last month or so.  Luckily, the 914s are running
great, as they're getting no attention.

It all started seven years ago when I stumbled across a lunch
stop of the Great American Race in Moab, Utah, of all places.
The Greatrace is a timed rally for old cars that goes more than
4,000 miles across America.  I dreamed of entering that race
someday.

Then two years ago I saw a Greatrace calendar in John Foley's
office at Aero California in La Paz, Mexico.  By the way, John
is not one to shy away from adventure - he was probably the
last American to leave, re-enter, then escape from Iran after
the fall of the Shah.  John had tuned into a replay of the
Greatrace on ESPN one morning in late 1994.  He called the
number on the tv, and said, "Sign me up."

"Fine," said the person at HQ, "And what car do you have?"

"I'll get one," said John.  John's job involves long hours and
large responsibilities running Maintenance Control at AeroCal -
and La Paz is not exactly a hot bed of antique cars - so John
called his brother-in-law in Lockport, New York, and said,
"Find me a car, we're going racing."

Harold, a retired GM factory worker and expert mechanic, found
a very nice 1936 Plymouth sedan.  The 1995 race was from Ottowa
to Mexico City, the first truly North American race.  With
Harold driving and John navigating the perfectly running car,
they won the rookie class, and fifth overall in Sportsman class
in a field of 120 cars.  John was hooked.

Last year, from Tacoma to Toronto, they placed 13th - a very
respectable performance - but way out of the limelight.
Meanwhile, John and I have worked together on a few projects at
the airline, where we shared our interest in old cars and the
Greatrace in the off-hours of my visits.  Every car on the 1996
Greatrace calendar was an open car.  Even as champion rookies,
their '36 Plymouth sedan rated only a tiny shot in a corner.

John said he was wanted an open car, one more in keeping with
the spirit of the race, so I invited him to attend the old car
swapmeet in Pomona with me.  He finally made it in March of
this year.  We saw a few interesting cars, but none bowled him
over.  Two weeks later I saw an ad for a "1915 Model T Ford
race car" in the local Recycler.  I went and took a video of
this beautiful yellow Speedster, and rushed the video to John
on the next AeroCal flight.  John's only words were, "Buy it."

Suddenly I found myself in possession of a car that I knew
very little about, as I had only heard tales about the Model T,
the most popular car in the world until the VW bug.  My mother
drove one to high school - the only car she has ever driven;
and my father had a new one when they were married in 1924.

Of course, the Speedster needed work to prepare for the race
just over two months in the future - with John a thousand miles
away.  I dug in.  Fortunately, I had ten weeks vacation on the
books, but in the last 20 years of my job as an "Avionics Field
Service Engineer," I have never taken more than a few days
vacation at a time, and then to just stay home from my travels.
I cover the Rockies and west, from Alaska to Panama.

The T changed little over the years of 1909-27 that the 15
million were built.  It has a rather conventional 4 cyl upright
flathead engine, but with gravity water circulation and splash
lubrication.  No  pumps to fail - or to preserve the bearings.

The tranny is a two speed planetary affair actuated by bands.
It just has pedals for gear selection, rather than the servos
that tighten the bands in today's automatics.  You have to
train yourself that neutral is only half way down on the
clutch, and low range is full down.  Couple that with the
throttle on a hand lever, and panic stops get exciting until
you re-learn to drive.  You find yourself chugging in low,
power-on, with a foot pushing on the puny brake.

The brake is just one more band in the tranny, and with no
front brakes, you gotta plan your stops.  The T originally
had magnets on the flywheel that triggered a coil for each
sparkplug.  Isn't that about what they're doing today?
Starter, generator, and elecrified lights were added in 1919.

Greatrace safety rules allow such things as a starter,
alternator, hydraulic brakes on all fours, a modern point-type
distributor, and they require seatbelts.

Using my garage full of parts accumulated over many years, the
first thing I did to the Speedster was to mate DC-9 cockpit
jumpseat belts to Porsche 914 seatbelt receptacles.  The hot
setup for ignition is a modern Bosch distributor adapter.
I am using a 914 dist., with lower rpm centif advance, and no
vac advance.  Still to be added are pre-'68 VW master cyl and
steering gear.  I have been working day and night on this
thing, and still a long ways from finished, with 13 days to go.

The rules allow a 4" speedometer, but no odometer.  We found a
used speedo from the 1990 race, but it is 4-1/2".  Just last
night I figured out how to cut it down to 4" - allowing it to
fit in a spare 914 tach case.

With just 22 hp, the stock model T is just not up to the 50+
mph speeds of the Greatrace.  Clifford Raisbeck's was the only
one to ever finish the race, in 1990, and he had to start very
early and finish late each day.

Our Speedster has an original 1915 aftermarket body, as featured
in the book, "Model T in Speed and Sport."  Hot rodding really
started with the Model T.  Floyd Clymer of auto book fame raced
against airplanes in a stripped Model T in 1912.  Greatrace
rules allow aftermarket modifications of the era, so we are in
great shape in that regard.  For the T, other mods of the era
included a larger radiator and a water pump, which our car has.
Even its 30" x 3-1/2" wire wheels conform.

The Speedster's later engine with a Frontenac "Fronty" overhead
valve setup places the car into a 1923 classification, and out
of the pre-1920 World Class.  Its 1928 Chevy crank and rods
don't matter, because they don't show.  A stock 1918 engine
came with the car, but it needs to be rebuilt.

Rebuilding a T engine is not an overnight affair.  The main
bearings are babbit poured into the block.  Word is that a good
combo is a Model A crankshaft with domed pistons to give more


respectable compression instead of the original 4:1.  So began
the search for a 1915-appearing hot engine.  We'll use the
Fronty engine as a spare for the race.

Where do you buy parts for a Model T?  Since there are still
150,000 of T's, it is easier than buying parts for a 914.
I found a complete set of spares for the Speedster - a
1911 Roadster with a Model A crank engine, hyd brakes, and a
lightweight, early overdrive.  This car is a real cutie, and
will get restored after the race.  Meanwhile, the best
mechanical parts from the two cars will go onto the Speedster,
and the rest will go into an enclosed trailer to be pulled by
our chase car.

John and I will be sharing the driving and navigating duties
for about 12 hours - or whatever it takes to cover 300 to 450
miles each day.  It's just a question of whether the 80 year
old car will outlast the 60 year old crew.

This is the nearly correct route for this year's Greatrace:
Fri  20 June  Sonoma, Calif, Trophy dash - warmup race
Sat. 21 June  Sonoma, to Fresno for first night.

                       lunch              overnight
     22            Bakerfield           Barstow
     23            Las Vegas, NV        St. George, UT
     24            Paige, AZ            Farmington, NM
Wed  25            Rio Rancho NM        Clovis
     26            Sweetwater TX        Granbury TX
     27            Gainsville TX        Norman OK
     28            Ft. Smith AR         Springfield, MO
     29            Mt. Vernon IL        Evansville, IN
     30            rest                      "
      1 July       Lexington KY         Knoxville TN
      2            Chattanooga TN       Newman  GA
      3            Columbus GA          Tallahassee
Fri   4            Gainsville FL: Finished- Jacksonville FL

If you can make it to a Greatrace city, you won't be
disappointed.  Please find the Yellow Peril, car 77, and
introduce yourself.  If you see the race on tv news, please 
record it, and I will reimburse you.  It won't be on ESPN this year.

Cheers,
Ralph
