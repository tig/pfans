Hello everybody:

Well I finally did it.  I applied molten metal to my 914 chassis, via a
small electrode, and some inert gas.  Carbon Dioxide and Argon to be
exact, in case so of you had other visions.  And you know what it worked
and I completed my project with out destroying my car or haveing a
meltdown and watching the molten metal burn thru my concrete floor and
head for center of the earth.

Anyway I used one of Rich Johnson kits and applied it to my car.  I did
not use the door braces like I planned on doing.  Blaspheme! I know, but
as Dad always said do as I say not as I do.  So I tossed caution to the
wind and still came out ahead.  My chassis was supported in the center on
a dolly previously described, I never had a problem with this chassis
folding, and only had to repair a small amount of rust, battery tray,
engine shelf, tiny hole in firewall.  Caution your experience may differ,
it is a car by car situation.  Rich's kit when on with out a hitch,
everything fit pretty well. I did debur it before installing, just to
keep a few fingers around.  I have grown found of them.

I found with a few simple bends out side the car the rest could be made
with the plates in the car.  For me the heat of the welder helped me get
the final contour of the metal a little easier.  So in the end, my car
did not fold up, and it is now going back together at a faster pace.

Few pointers:

1) Use a gas mig welder, if you can weld or want to try this by far is
the easiest.  And the welds turn out great.  Nicest ones I have made yet,
they look great.

2) Use easy grind Mig wire, it cost about $30 for a 10lbs roll, but well
worth it when it comes time to grind your welds.

3) Take your time and fit every thing well.

4) You can get pieces to fit slightly better, when welding, taking and
the hammer and dollying the rest of the panel into place.

5) Clamps are your friend, and so are strong magnates.

6) If you have forgot hint #3, take your time, check everything at least
twice before you strike your first weld.  

Good luck to anyone that is contemplating doing this, it can be done, but
if you have the least amount of body flex, use fixtures and clamping to
support your car.

Take care,
Stephen Jacobs
