FWIW, I recently upgraded to 5 bolt hubs, bought 6X16" rims and was
faced with a similar decision. My tires also are for street only for
now. After surfing the various web sites and reading "contact patch" in
EC over the past couple years, I bought a set of Pirelli P7000s in
205/55/16. They have about 3 months and 3k miles on them now. I have
been very pleased. They fit nicely under stock fenders. The grip is
phenomenal in dry and excellent in wet. I can take a fairly tight
cloverleaf on my daily commute at 60-65 (about as fast as I care to)
with no squeal where the old stock tires started to break loose at about
50. They ride well - I notice no increased harshness vs the old stock
high profile 165HR15s. They have not shown any sig wear in this
admittedly short period of time. They are also Z-rated, which isn't much
of an issue with my 1.8, but if I ever get my 3.2....  You can get them
for $147 a piece mail order. I bought them for $159 at the local store
which includes lifetime balance and rotation. I'm told Bridgestone S-02s
are worth looking at too.

Good luck,
