Don't waste your time on turbo charging the VW 4 cylinder. The combustion
chamber design is really lame so the compression ratio has to be kept really
low. The poor combustion chamber design also makes the head run hotter,
which is another reason the compression ratio is so low. Furthermore, it's
very very difficult to add cooling capacity, so you're best off sticking
with a near stock configuration. If you add a turbo, you'll melt the engine
in no time flat. 

 Can I add strut tower braces without to much problem.  

No strut braces are required. There already is a steel bulkhead running
right between the front and back shock towers. The main weak point is in the
area where the rear suspension connects to the body. There are
re-inforcement kits available for welding in that really help. You would
only need them if you're going to race or if you add a much bigger engine,
like a chevy V8.

Unless you have deep pockets, just fix the rust and maintain what you have -
that should keep you busy enough for a long time.
