Hi Matt!

  O.K., at this point, I agree with Bill S.  If you have a good spark at the end of the coil high tension wire, 
 then the entire low-tension ignition circuit is probably OK (points, condenser, wiring, etc.).
  You are then left with four things:  bad distributor cap (unlikely... I believe you said it was new), bad 
plug wires, defective plugs, or, as Bill S. said, timing.  I had a tussle with my 914 when I first got it, 
owing to the fact that the plug wires were mixed up.  The thing refused to run, although once in a while, 
I got a tremendous backfire.

  Here's what you need to check:    As I recall, you said that you have a 1.7 litre engine.  This engine 
has three timing marks on the BASE OF THE FAN.  They are TDC, 5 degrees before TDC (static 
timing mark) and 27 degrees before TDC (dynamic timing mark).  Now, the trick is, these timing 
marks are placed where they would be useful for a type IV Volkswagen, from which the engine is 
derived.  But in a VW, the engine is in the rear of the car, behind the rear wheels.  So, the timing 
marks can be easily seen in a VW.  In a 914, they are all but invisible; you will need a small mirror to 
see them, or else you will have to crawl into the engine compartment , butt your head up against the 
sound deadener pad, and look through the hole in the fan shroud backwards in the general direction 
of your navel to see them.  They are on the end of the fan closest to the engine proper, the "base' of 
the fan. 
  I presume you have a Haynes book; if not, go buy one; they are not perfect, but they form an 
excellent starting reference.  In the Haynes book, pg 65, fig. 3.6, you will see an angle for the slot in 
the distributor drive shaft described.  This angle is also pretty much the same for the tip of the rotor 
when the distributor is installed.  Bring your engine to TDC on the compression stroke on #1 cylinder.  
This can be done by rotating the engine until the TDC timing mark lines up with the notch in the fan 
housing, and, with the left side valve cover off, check to see that both valves on cylinder #1 are 
closed (a little bit of free play in the rocker arms).  If you are on the TDC mark with either valve open, 
you need to rotate the engine one complete revolution to the next TDC and at this point, both valves 
should be closed.   I know this is a hassle, but until you do it, you will not know where you are.  Once 
you are lined up at TDC on the compression stroke on #1, check to see if the rotor is pointing toward 
the fan shroud at about the 12 degree angle depicted in the Haynes book.  If not, you will have to pull 
the distributor and rotate the distributor drive shaft to the correct alignment per paragraph 6 on pg 64 
of the Haynes book. 
  Once you have the distributor orientation correct, then check the wire orientation in the cap.  
Remember that the flat 4 engine has an unusual firing order: 1,4,3,2.  The wire connector in the cap 
directly above the #1 cylinder TDC position of the rotor is the #1 plug wire; it should go to the REAR 
cylinder on the LEFT side of the car.  The next plug wire CLOCKWISE around the distributor (as 
viewed from the top) is the #4 plug wire; it should go to the FRONT cylinder on the RIGHT side of the 
car.  The next plug wire CLOCKWISE around the distributor is #3; it should go to the REAR cylinder 
on the RIGHT side of the car.   The last remaining plug wire (just before you get back to #1 in a 
clockwise direction) is #2; it goes to the FRONT cylinder on the LEFT side of the car.

  Once you have this orientation correct, finish up by doing a static timing of the ignition system.  
Rotate the engine just slightly in the backwards direction (can be done by nudging the car 
backwards just a bit in 5th gear) until the 5 degree static timing mark is in the notch.  Remember, this 
is literally only 5 degrees of rotation of the engine, so make any movement VERY slight, or you will 
go right past it.
  Once you have the timing marks lined up, connect your voltmeter to the coil  ( - ) terminal and 
ground, ignition on, loosen the distributor clamp bolt, and rotate the distributor clockwise as viewed 
from the top.  The voltmeter should go to zero (or close to it) when the points close.  Now, rotate the 
distributor COUNTER-clockwise until the voltmeter just jumps up to 12 volts.  Rotate no farther than 
the point where the voltage just appears, indicating that the points have just opened.  You may have 
to go back and forth on the rotation until you find just the right spot, but always approach it from the 
COUNTER-clockwise direction, and stop immediately when the voltage appears.  Tighten the 
clamp bolt to lock the distributor in this position.

  Hop in the car, and crank it up.  If everything else is OK, the engine should now run.  It is best to 
perform a dynamic timing adjustment with a timing light as per paragraph 4 on page 64 of the 
Haynes book, but the above should get your car running.

                                                  Good Luck,
                                                  Jim T.
