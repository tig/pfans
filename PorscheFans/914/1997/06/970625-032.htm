I have the ultimate 914 (or 914-6) brake package for sale:

4 Bremtek Racing Brakes for 914 (or 914-6).  Fronts are freshly rebuilt 
by Bremtek (stainless pistons, all new seals and hardware), rears were 
rebuilt at the same time but have about 10 hours of use on them (ie. 
they're in excellent shape!)   

Can be used with original rotors, or you can upgrade to 911 SC or Carrera 
rotors (vented rotors front and rear).  Will fit under 15" alloy wheels.  
With these brakes my 914-6 race car was pulling about 1.1g's under 
braking.

Includes 2 sets of Cool Carbon Blue Compound pads (one set unused, one 
near new). And one set of barely used Cool Carbon Orange Compound pads.

Includes hard lines for connecting to calipers, and 4 used stainless 
steel flex lines.   Also you'll get my custom master cylinder bracket 
that will improve the pedal feel in any 914.  

I'm asking $1200 for everything (I'll pay shipping).   For those in the 
Bay Area, we can arrange to test fit to your car if you have any doubts 
about how these things fit.
