Hi,

 I'm going to pick up my new 74 914 2.0l parts car this weekend.
The car is a basket case body wise, but the P.O. had the engine
completely rebuilt and has the docs to prove it. He started to 
restore the body last year but found that he was way over his
head. Bottom line, his wife says get rid of car, I get a rebuilt 74
2.0l (that has been checked out a porsche mechanic) for $300
and all the spare parts he bought for the car to use for my 
73 2.0l.

Now to my question, my 73 body and suspension wise is very
good, but my engine needs some work. It leaks oil, compression


showes 85, 100, 125, 125, doesn't idle well, hot start problem,
etc... you get the picture. What I would like to do is take the 74s
engine and swap it into my 73. The 74 has a dual carb setup, 73s
has a single carb setup. Is there any things I should look for
when doing this swap? It should be a no brainer correct?
Any advice?

Thanks,

Garold Shaffer
