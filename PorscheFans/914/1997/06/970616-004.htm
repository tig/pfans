	Call GPR (800/321-5432) for some new bushings.  Hopefully the
one at the firewall is still good, because I'm told taking the front
shift rod out with the engine still in (which you need to do to replace
the firewall piece) is a real bear.
	The two you'll want are the "castellated" bushing that goes
through the flange on the side-shifter piece (where the rear shift rod
goes into it), and the cup bushing that goes onto the gear selector,
inside the plastic cover of the side-shifter part.
	When you install the rear shift rod, wiggle it around a lot.
You need to get the hole in the rod lined up with the hole in the part
that goes around the rod, so the set-screw will go in as far as possible.
The one on the aft part should screw in very close to flush.
	While you're under the car, put it in gear and then grab that
rear shift rod and wiggle it.  Some movement is inevitable, but the less
there is, the better.  On my car, the hole through the side-shifter
flange had been worn oval, so even a new bushing didn't eliminate slop
there.  I wound up using JB Weld to epoxy the new bushing in place.
	Haynes has a pretty good procedure for adjusting the shift
linkage inside the center tunnel.  It's not that tough to follow, give
it a try.
	Good luck!
