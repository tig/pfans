	This is on the street mind you.  I have a cyberdyne that I
checked with various voltages before I mounted it in the sump.
I use 5W30 in the winter and 10W30 or 10W40 in the summer.
The car has 170,000  miles on it and is stock as far as I know.
I have had reservations using thick oils because of the way the 
cooler bypass works.  It's not temperature dependent but pressure
based on oil thickness.  When it's cold, bypass opens and not all the
oil flows through.  When it warms up, the oil thins, pressure drops,
and more is sent through the cooler.  The thing was designed for 30
weight, i don't even know if they had multiweights in mind when they
did it.  At temperature, the 40 or 50  weight will send less through
the cooler.  My guess is that the thicker weights will MAKE your car
run hotter.  Of course, the first thing people do when the car runs
hot is put a thicker oil in it.  I wonder if that is like putting
gasolineona fire.
	Yesterday it was 97 degrees here.  I took the highway home
It shot  up to 220dF pretty fast, but I wasn't out long enough to stabilize.
THe highest temperature Ive driven anygreat distance in is low to mid
80's.
