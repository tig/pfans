Yeah, but the funny thing was that he talked with the Castrol guys about 
thier "XL" oil and the normally tested it at 150degC. They said it broke 
down at about 250degC, I think. The upshot was to use single weight 
non-detergent oil because it takes high temperatures better. I'm sure 
modern multigrades have come a long way and are plenty good enough now.

Did you ask Bob about whether stock stamped steel valve covers vs. cast 
aluminum ones made a difference in his measurements? That would be good 
to know.
