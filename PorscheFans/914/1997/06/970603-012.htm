Nope, you're doing pretty well on that. Keep going... :)

Yes, in theory. But we have to take in the human factor here, and in a
car with a low moment of inertia, like the 914. The car will respond
very rapidly to any input made by the driver and will change states so
quickly that unless the driver is incredibly fast and incredibly
talented, any inputs supplied by the driver will probably provoke an
under-damped oscillation. Yes, in theory a low PMI car should be able to
recover incredibly quick. But the driver is usually there to muck up
that recovery. ;) There is a perfect example of this, but DON'T TRY THIS
ON THE STREET, get the car into a "tank slapper" oscillation. You know,
the tail gets out to the right and you over correct left and it goes
left even farther, so you overcorrect right and so forth. When it's so
out of shape that there's no getting it back, let the car fix itself.
Both feet out, and hands OFF! The car will straighten itself out in a
hurry, so fast that if your hands or fingers get in the way of the
steering wheel you could brake some bones. It's a violent and last ditch
effort to recover a spin, and it works fairly often. This is common to
many small mid-engined cars. But this is also a way to come to stop in a
hurry. BTW, *DON'T* do this in a top heavy sedan. "Tank-slapper"
oscillations are the text book way to induce a smooth surface roll over.
The 914 has such a low CG that roll overs are incredibly unlikely as
long as it doesn't hit anything solid.

Isn't it though? But the educator's got to do it for free too! ;)

When I can get my classical texts out of storage, I'll sit down and try
and derive a fundamental model for a mid engined car. But don't hold
your breath, it might be a while.
