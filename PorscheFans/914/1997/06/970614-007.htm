OK it's time for another of Dirk's special tools courtesy of the local
hardware store. This is a hub install tool for inserting the hub into your
new rear wheel bearing. It consists of a 5" long by 5/8" thread bolt, two
5/8" cut washers, and one 5/8" nut. The bolt needs to have threads along
it's entire length. It just so happens that the 5/8" cut washer OD fits
perfectly into the washer recess on the outside of the hub. This is nice
because it makes the bolt self-centering. You'll also need a 15/16" socket
and combi wrench. Put some grease on 3/4 of the length of the bolt.  Check
your hubs for dings on the inner edge of the stub (the part that gets
inserted into the bearing). File any protrusions from hammering until they
are smooth. Take a spare stub axle and insert it into the hub. It should
go together right up to the shoulder of the stub axle with no resistance.
Put a thin layer of anti-seize on the outside of the hub stub, put one
washer on the bolt and insert the bolt from the rear of the bearing. Place
the hub on the exposed bolt, slide on a washer and insert it into the
washer recess on the hub. Thread on the nut, use the socket and suitable
extension from the rear to hold the head of the bolt still, and use the
box end of the combi wrench to tighten the nut. It should slide in no
problem. Tighten until very tight. Untighten and remove bolt. Put some
anit-seoze on the splines of a spare stub axle. Take the axle and insert
it. Install washer and nut. Tighten nut. Check for bearing play. Relax. 
Have a beer, you're done.
