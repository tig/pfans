The 914 in general? Or _my_ 914? ;)

In general, the 914 can be a very easy car to keep. The problem arises
however that the car is over 20 years old and has probably gone through
at least a couple of owners who thought "simple maintenance" meant that
they could just ignore it like a honda. Not so, and as a result many
914s at this stage will need significant rejuvination to bring back from
previous owner neglect. A 914 in good shape will only require minimal
maintenance to keep going for a long time. But it needs that minimal
maintenace at its regular intervals, and can't be ignored. Things like
valve adjustments, oil changes (both engine and tranny), filter changes,
and an attentive owner to keep an ear/eye out for problems.

Compared to a 20 year old MG or Alfa? Fantastic! Compared to a 20 year
old Mercedes? Not quite so well. If you're looking for an old open top
sports car, it's really hard to do much better than the 914 for the
price. But this is considering the average maintenace of these cars
_now_, not when they were built.

Ok. Step one. You are thinking of buying a 20 year old sports car. You
will have to accept the fact that it WILL require more maintenance than


a Honda Civic. If at this point you are willing to shoulder that
responsibility, then you have two choices. One, research all of the
available independent Porsche mechanics in your area and determine which
of them is the most qualified (not neccessarily the cheapest) to work on
your 914, and open up your wallet. Or two, roll up your sleeves and open
up your brain and get ready to learn all about the joys of back-yard
wrenching.

As you have already noticed, alot of us really enjoy doing our own work.
And some of us don't, but do anyway. Always dragging your car to a
$50-60 per hour mechanic can get expensive, and simply going on-line is
usually alot cheaper. And just so you don't think that CV joint
replacement is commonplace, it isn't. It's messy, often frustrating, but
it doesn't happen very often. It justy happens to be the topic du-jour.

We will be more than happy to help if you have a problem, and as time
goes on, alot of these questions will find their way onto the archives
and you can just search for them.

In looking for a 914, the more info you have, the better. I would
strongly recomend trying to find someone to help you in your car search.
One of us would probably be more than willing to help out if you lived
close by. Also have the car checked out by an independent Porsche
mechanic before you consider buying it.

And if you get a 914, you will no doubt learn more than you ever thought
possible. By the way, "D-Jet" is the name of the fuel injection system,
made by Bosch, that came with the 1.7L and 2.0L model 914s, as well as
with the 912E.
