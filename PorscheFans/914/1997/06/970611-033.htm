	Some further lessons about this monstrosity called Smog II...

	Lesson #1:  If you can tweak the car so that it passes in the
pre-test, don't let the smog monkey turn the engine off.  Your car was
passing when it was good and warm, and even 30 seconds of cool-off
time may be too much, at least if the aforementioned simian starts the
test right away.
	Lesson #2:  Just because your car passes a pre-test doesn't
mean that it will pass the real test.
	Lesson #3:  For pre-1980 cars, there are NO RESULTS PRINTED on
the screen until after the data is sent to DMV.  For 80+ cars, the
PASS or FAIL result is printed on the screen before the data is sent.

	Results:  I am now the proud owner of California's latest
official Gross Polluter.  Fine on Idle HC, close on Idle CO, great on
2500 RPM HC, 0.22% over the GP limit on 2500 RPM CO.
	What the hell do I do now?  My registration runs out on the
16th of this month (been trying to get it to pass for several weeks).
	Any constructive suggestions?
