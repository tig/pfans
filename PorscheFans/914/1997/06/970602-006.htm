Those could be 100# or higher springs. Are the windings equally spaced?

Can't hazzard a guess to what "HECO" means, but I'd hazard a guess and
say you've got a set of Konis there.

Good idea. Might be a goldmine in there under all that grime.

Not unless you or someone knows the exact spring rates and you can fix
the chassis solidily and push on A-arm with a measurable force. Gonna
have to pull 'em to measure 'em. 

What kind of sway bars does it have?

All 914-4s had the same gearsets. But because they're all 901 boxes,
there are a host of gearsets available for you to use if you want. If
the rules allowed me to change gearsets, I'd put in a shorter 3rd for
autoxing.

I've never actually replaced gears, so I can't say how easy it is. I'm
sure others out there know how though.
