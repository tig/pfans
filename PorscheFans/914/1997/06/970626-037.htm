I've had no trouble painting over POR-15.  Just scuff the surface with a 
Scotchbrite pad or >240 grit sandpaper to give the paint something to grip.

Okay,

I'll chew up some bandwidth here.....  Is brushing on POR-15 rather than
spraying it a problem?  I plan on using that stuff on the car after welding
in the reinforcement kits.  No new seam sealant here; I'm going to seam weld
all those joints... =8^)  I have a preference for POR mainly because the
local distributor is only about 15 minutes away....  Has anyone used them
both and can offer any direct back to back comparison?  I've basically heard
that:
	POR15
	pro				con
	more durable			more toxic
 	more flexible			can't paint over it
	less surface prep needed	UV sensitive
	can brush on  	 			needs "rough" surface to adhere to

	Corroless
	pro				con
	can paint over			less durable
	can be used for	finish work	more expensive
					should be sprayed
