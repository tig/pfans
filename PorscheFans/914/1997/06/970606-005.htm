Nope, but I posted a detailed description of it earlier. Cost me all of =
13$.
Let me know if you want me to describe it more detail.

Josh, I said the *towers* were clean (the part of the body where the
shocks are installed), and I sprayed undercoating up into the *towers*
not on my shocks!

BTW, a previous had an engine bleed to death - the little blue light
bulb in the dash was burned out. So, yes, there was plenty of grimy
oil crud under the trunk.

Well, I'll just have to keep an eye on my stud tightness.

I talked to a fella selling one in somewhat poor shape. Bad paint job (so=
me
bondo), rusty floors, needs all new rubber and a windshield. Motor blows =

smoke on startup only and the tranny leaks but has good synchros. Carpets
are bad, seats are good, dash has a glued-on cover. Ignition switch is =
bad,
has a push button instead (he has a good used one). Has Fuchs, too. Also,
mismatched  front turn signals (1 euro, 1 amer.). Before the bad paint =
job, car
had bad door jams. I haven't seen the car yet, though. He's asking 3,200$=
,
I figured it was worth half of that, at most. He drives it regularly, als=
o, which
is good.
