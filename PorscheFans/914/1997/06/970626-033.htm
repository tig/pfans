Interesting,  I also noticed while at the local Advanced Auto parts the
other day, they had a set of round lights that looked like a close to
perfect fit for $40.  I have not made it back to see if I was dreaming,
but it did make me do a double take.  I also have a set of Cibie units
that are a exact fit, which I will pull the P/N off of at some time and
see what they are.  The hold 100W H3 currently, and any H3 bulb will
work.  But I think some of you have an interest in the $40.00 units also.
 Since I know the Cibies have to be more than $40~ more like $240.  Glad
I got them in a parts car, and not paying real money for them.

Take care,
