Any info on what was done to the motor in the rebuild?

Ok, I'm gonna step up on my little soap box again. If your intention
with this car is primarilly competition, then suspension is going to be
the most important investment you'll make with the car. My personal
recomendation is if you can get something adjustable, GET IT. By that I
mean go for the externally adjustable Konis (or Tokico), the Weltmeister
sway bar(s), and if you are so inclined, the adjustable perch spring kit
as well. Why? Good question, lets look at each one. 

Adjustable vs. Non-adjustable shocks: With the Bilsteins, while you're
getting very good (if not the best) street shock. You'll find that as
your skills improve that there will be times when you want more damping
or less damping depending on the surface you're running on. A really
smooth surface and you can crank the shocks extra stiff. But on a bumpy
asphalt surface, softer shocks will help keep your tires in contact with
the ground more.

Adjustable vs. non-adjustable sway bars: If you are going from autox to
track and back, you will discover that a car ideally set up for autox is
most likely gonna be pretty loose at high speeds. An adjustable front
bar will allow you to increase or decrease the understeer of the car
without altering any of the carefully set up alignment. As for
Weltmeister vs. Addco? I prefer the weltmeister, as it retains the
factory position, through the body of the car and is a very simple,
elegant design. The Addco I thought was an under-body bar. I'd say go
for the Welt bar. IF it's in your budget.

Adjustable vs. non-adjustable spring perches. This is really a minimal
thing compared to shocks and bars, but the adjustable perches allow you
to corner balance (see Andy's most excelent description of a few days
ago) the car and still retain a fairly level car. As for spring weight?
I'd say starting out with 145# springs is a good start. You may find in
the future that you'll want stiffer springs, but they're fairly cheap
and not too hard to replace.
 
> Are torsion bars an important componant?
> My (limited) thinking is that "the stiffer, the better".  Is this true?

Not always. Just like shocks, if it's too stiff on bumpy terain, your
tires will spend more time airborne than on the ground. Not ideal. Yes,
you can certainly have a car that is too stiff to drive effectively. If
you stay with the 145# or so rear springs, leave the front torsion bars
stock.

> Does having adjustable sways important for the 914?

See above.

> Am I going to have a sore ass driving to work everyday???

With your current proposal, you'll probably be fine. I'm running 150#
springs, stock torsion bars and race Konis. My butt gets sore after
about 2 hours. But I don't have much in the way of OEM padding (5'-6"
120lbs). Whereas Dave can remove the lower cushion from his seat and
still be comfortable after a couple of hours driving. Everyone is built
differently and has different thresholds of comfort.

These all retain the original heat exchangers, and are going to sound
ok. The Bursch is hands down the best system to get. If and when you
want a more race oriented system, you'll want tuned headers and a free
flow muffler. This will sound raspy (screaming) to many. But to others,
it's simply music made by Porsche! :)

*********************************
Before you do ANYTHING to the car, Read the rules regarding what class
you want to or intend to compete in. I can tell you right now that you
will not be able to run in SCCA stock class in autocross. Carbs were
never a stock option on the car and will bump you into Street Prepared.
Where, by the way,  all the suspension mods you want to do _are_
allowed. As for PCA, it all depends on your local rules. Read 'em before
doing anything. As for body panels? Save your money if want to be
competetive in the near future. Most clubs only allow glass body panels
in the higher prep classes. The "trailer-riding-fire-breathing-monsters"
as I call 'em.
 
Read the rules, Read the rules, and oh yeah... Read the rules.

Good luck!
