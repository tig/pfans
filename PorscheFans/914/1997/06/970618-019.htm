Hi All, I just found out I'm being transferred and need to sell my collection
of 914's and parts, as of now I'm hoping to sell as a complete unit. For best
offer.
(SO FAR BEST OFFER IS $2000.)
I will follow up with a complete listing after I've had time to inventory it
all.

What I have... ( a partial listing)

CARS
-- 1 72 with gt flares engine is out and interior out was converting to a CSP
car.. only rust is in usual battery tray but suspension console is good.
-- 1 73 1.7 complete except for windshield on a scale of 1 to 10 it's a 3.5,
needs floors and work
-- 1 73 shell pretty much stripped missing driver's side fender

PARTS
-- 1 custom made set of wheels (cyclone style) made by Western to fit a 4 lug
with gt flares must be 7" and 8" or 8" and 10"previous owner was friend with
head of Western... only set known in existence
-- 1 ac system for 914 (compressor, front box, hoses etc...)
-- multiple interiors all years about 8 backs and 4 seats multiple door
panels etc...
-- multiple steel cross members suitable for welding too
-- 1 performance 1.7 and 1 regular 1.7 engine
-- 2 transmissions
-- 6 spare doors (3 sets)
-- 10 steel wheels
-- spare disassembled engine in box minus heads
-- about 6 roof panels, some sanded smooth
-- couple hoods, dented, couple trunk lids good...
-- spare door glass, spare 2 rear glasses
-- steering wheels 2 I think
-- 34ict webers
-- multiple fuel injections
-- multiple drip trays under engine cover
-- spare engine covers maybe 3
and boxes and boxes of other stuff I can't remember (rubber etc..) literally
fills 1 car garage to a height of about 6 feet would fill about 4 pickup
trucks overflowing. almost forgot, in all my boxes I have multiple fuel
injection parts (brains etc...) and who knows what else...

Please respond to dmer@aol.com as I don't always get the digested list every
day.
