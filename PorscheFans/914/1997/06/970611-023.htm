This is very sound advice.  My experience with 914s goes back about
3 years now, when I picked up a fire-bombed '70 1.7 for $250.  I'd never
done more than a brake-job and a oil change before and decided to use
this
basket case to break into a new hobby.  My wife thought I was a lunatic
-
she changed her mind when 18 months later I was driving a Sunflower
Yellow
914 around the neighborhood and breaking in the engine.

I, of course, immediately fell in love with the 914 and made alot of 
new friends locally and starting hanging out on the lists.  I decided
to pursue the "baptism by fire" approach.  In the time since, I just
dived into everything from a complete engine-rebuild, picking up a 
good chassis in Indiana, and an interior from a '73 that had broken
in half up in northern Michigan.  

I started by cleaning the firebomber up and salvaging what a could 
from it (mostly the powerplant) and learned and worked from there.
I even took the time to strip the chassis down to the suspension 
only and *by hand* stripped it and primed it myself - only to finally
realize the chassis was too rusted out to save (2k welding quote -
OUCH!).

Since that time there is little I haven't done to my current "bastard"
914 and the experience and satisfaction of doing all the work myself
is indescribable.  Especially when you spend an entire winter in the
basement rebuilding an engine from the ground up, learning and sweating
all the way, finally to have the engine fire up and run on the first
try.

To me, it's been great fun, a good hobby - however, I have about 2x the
$$$ into my car that I could get for selling it but I don't care.  There
is nothing you can't do without patience, the right tools and good 
advice from the list!

I will be driving it again soon and it sure does put a smile on my face
when we are on the road together. I'm sure I'll continue to work on this
car over the years - there is *always* something to fix, improve,
rebuild
or polish up.

Then again, I've a friend who got a solid street/track 914 for about $5k
and drives it all the time with little or no problems.  If you find the 
right car (have an experience person help you determine it is in great
shape) it would be a good way to start.  Then tackle the problems as 
they come up....if I can do it, I think anyone can.
