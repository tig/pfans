Hi,

From my type 1 experience, oil temps over about 220-230 degrees were
suppose to be into the problem zone,
could pull head studs.  I'm not sure if it is different with the T4 cases.
I'd guess it is that temp or a bit higher.  I have a stock gauge with no
numbers. I calibrated it with boiling water so I'm running about the 220230
range right now.  I don't trust the rebuilder that the PO used just before
I got the car so plan to drop the engine and check things out.  Hoping to
drop the temps a bit when finished.

I have a VDO CHT gauge under the #3 plug right now. Plan to move it to the
Temp 2 sensor when I get the FI system to put back on.  I've never seen
official numbers for the CHT, there don't seem to be any.  From my
experience and others I've asked, about 350 deg seems to be the typical
number seen.  Mine seems to run about 350-360.  I've heard from people who
say they'll back off if it gets to 400deg.

What air/fuel gauge do you use?  What O2 sensor?  Exactly where did you
mount it on the #4 exchanger.   I have a Cyberdyne gauge and a one wire
sensor (plan to get a 3 wire sensor instead) that I'm going to mount.  I
was going to put the O2 mounting bung in the merge of the four pipes to
check overall mixture.  Why did you pick #4?

You have an external oil cooler but not an oil pressure gauge?  That'll
tell you when starvation occurs since the sender is at the end of an
oil galley directly above the oil pump itself...

Also - to everyone.  Going to start my baby up this weekend and finally
to the time to plumb and wire up my oil temperature gauge - what are
typical good operating temperatures for our cars - what is the danger
zone.  (Currently, I've got an oil pressure gauge, oil temp. and a
fuel/air LED gauge fed from an O2 sensor near #4 on my SS exchanger,
next to go in with be a clyinder head temp gauge...then maybe a vacuum
gauge....hey maybe then an altimeter and an artificial horizon!)

Cheers,
