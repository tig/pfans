Bernie,

Crutchfield and I went 'round and 'round about speakers.  You
thing that they would remember!  But anyway, the speakers you
want are 4x6, NOT 5x7.  And you want a "metric" 4x6, as they
are slightly smaller.

Oh, and get the DIN plate from George.  Makes life much easier.
You can make it yourself, but you'll spend more.  (You think
that after all these plugs, I'd get a T-Shirt....)

Gary.
