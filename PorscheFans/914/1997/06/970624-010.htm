Garold:

A "110 pound" spring will compress one inch for every 110 pounds of 
weight placed on it; a "140 pound" spring will compress one inch for 
every 140 pounds of weight on it.

To measure the rate of your springs in ten easy steps:

1.  Get a big cardboard box (2 feet on a side is good) and a friend.
2.  Put the box on the floor in a well-lit room and put a bathroom 
    scale inside it.
3.  Put a towel or something on the scale in order to protect it and 
    make its surface less slippery.
4.  Stand your spring up on the scale.  Lay a straightedge across 
    the top of the sping and mark where it touches the side of the 
    box.
5.  Make another mark one inch below the first.
6.  Ask your friend to watch closely.
7.  With the straightedge still on the spring, put your foot on it 
    and slowly press downward until the straightedge points to the 
    lower mark.
8.  Ask your friend to read the number on the scale.  Call this "x".
9.  Take your foot and the straightedge off the spring and read the 
    scale again to find the weight of the spring itself.  Call this 
    "y".
10. Spring rate = x - y.

While you CAN do the test without putting your scale inside a box, I
wouldn't recommend it.  The spring will probably slip on the scale at
least once during the test; if it's not contained within a box,
it'll more than likely fly across the room into something
expensive... Like the side of a newly-painted car.

Oh... And two more things:

    1.  If you're a really big guy, you might want to compress the
    springs TWO inches and divide "x" by 2... That'll give you a
    little better accuracy.

    2.  If you've got cheap-ass non-linear springs, your measurement
    won't be accurate over the spring's entire range, since you're
    only measuring the rate over one inch of spring compression.

Hope this helps...
