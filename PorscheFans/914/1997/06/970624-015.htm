I just finished bolting 320i brake calipers to the front of my 914.  I =
managed to straighten one brake line out enought to rebend it to where =
it would fit.  Given the amount of bending it took, I really don't want =
to rely on it to stop my car (assuming the engine was in it to make it =
go, but I digress...).  I can't find any place locally that can make the =
correct bubble flares for the ends, and the only places that sell =
pre-made lines don't carry anything shorter than 10".  There was some =
discussion several months ago on some place that sold pre-made lines.  =
Can anyone tell me what the place was, where, and maybe a phone number?  =
And do they sell anything around 4"?

Thanks
Andy Lester
