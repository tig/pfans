The somewhat sad thing about owning a 914 is that they are more
difficult to work on compared to other typical cars of the period, hence =

over time they were not maintained properly, so by now most of them
need major work. Another twist is that most average mechanics are
not very familiar with them, further complicating maintainence. My
opinion is that unless you are willing to get up to your elbows in
ancient grit and grease and willing to get mechanically
competent real fast, then a 914 is a bad choice. In terms of
reliability, the lack of regular maintainence over the years has
made these cars somewhat unreliable *unless* they are brought
back up to factory spec. This being a Porsche/VW hybrid,
I would think in terms of a really expensive VW when comparing
it to other cars. Old cars are usually higher (sometimes much higher)
maintainence than newer cars. I'm a mechanical engineer, I dig
machines. When something breaks, I say: "All right! rock and roll!,
I get to take my car apart! I can't wait!!!." This is somewhat
different than your average response to a mechanical failure. So,
I'm well tailored to owning old cars. Others may not be, including
yourself.

Maybe you should get an aircooled VW and start there. They
are very easy to work on, parts are cheap and plentiful, and
they are very simple cars.

Then when you get a handle on auto mechanics and you have
some money burning a hole in your bank account, go out and
rescue a 914.
