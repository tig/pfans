Howdy,

Well, I can give you some ideas on tires from use on my BMW M3, as I don't
have a 914, YET.  Well, my car came with D40 M2s when I purchased it.  I
was quite impressed with the grip and wear. They did suck (MAJORLY) in
snowy conditions, and I thought they were only ok in the wet.  Next I got a
set of Pirelli P-Zeros.  These tires were awesome in ALL conditions...TALK
ABOUT GRIP. After 3K miles I went to my shop for some clutch work, and I
was concerned about some high speed shimmy.  I found that 3 out of 4 of my
tires had "tire bubbles".  After over 2 months of argueing with the tire
rack, they told me it was my fault, for driving into curbs or big pot
holes.  I told them I lived in California where potholes aren't a real
issue, and I've hit not curbs, but they didn't care.  They basicly told me
to, "go fly a kite."  So, I called Pirelli, they offered to reimburse me
25% of the original cost (big deal, but better than the Tire Rack!).
Anyway, I then went and got a set of SP8000s.  They are good tires, but
lack the awesome grip of the P-Zeros especially in decelleration.  

So, I would get the P-Zeros if money isn't a problem (and you don't mind
replacing them regularly.)  D40 M2s are a good value.  SP8000s are a step
up from them, but not as great at the Pirellis.  My feeling is, "use tire
mail order with caution!"  They won't do much for you once they sell you
the tires if you have a problem.  The odds of having a problem go up
considerably when getting high-performance tires.  See if you can get a
local shop to match mail order prices.  The customer service will be worth
it even if you do need to pay slightly more.

Good luck,
