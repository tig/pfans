Hi, if you are interested in SB42 passing and  you are in California and
could go to this, or at least write or email your Assemblyman do it soon.

Thanks,
Jeff

Subject:  RE: Support for SB42




        From:       Senator Quentin L. Kopp

        To:         Supporters of SB 42-  Classic Car Smog Check
        Exemption

        Subject:    Support at Assembly Transportation Committee
        Hearing


        Thank you again for your support of my SB 42 which would exempt
        all vehicles 25 or more model years old from the biennial smog
        check requirement.  I would like to elicit your further support
        through attendance at the Monday, June 16, 1997 hearing on the
        bill by the Assembly Transportation Committee.  The hearing will
        commence at 1:30 p.m. in Room 4202 in the State Capitol in
        Sacramento.

        It is vitally important that supporters of SB 42 show their
        support in order to overcome the opposition to the bill by the
        Air Resources Board and Bureau of Automotive Repair.  Those of
        you who have written to me in support of the legislation are
        uniquely qualified to articulate the merits of the proposal and
        answer questions with regard to the vehicles which would be
        affected and benefit from the bill.

        I look forward to your attendance at the hearing and that of
        others who support SB 42.  Your further dissemination of this
        memorandum and request is also appreciated very much.
