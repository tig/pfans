A local mechanic I trust said that if you replace the golf-ball-and-pocket 
part of the tailshift linkage (right behind the driver) with a u-joint from a 
spare steering shaft, you get more positive shifts than with a sideshift.  
Haven't tried it, but it's now a "public" idea.  Somebody go for it.

Steve, the transmission internals are pretty much identical. What really
differs is the linkage and accuracy of your shifts. If nothing else,
replace all of the linkage bushings. You _might_ be able to get away
with a tail shifter in much of autoxing as most of it will involve very
few shifts. But in TT, you'll be shifting alot, and one missed shift
could very well cost you an engine. So, if you can afford a new engine,
you certainly can afford a side shifter instead. It's no guarantee that
you won't miss a shift, but it certainly betters your chances. Also,
you'll be very pleased with how much better the shifting is with a side
shifter.
