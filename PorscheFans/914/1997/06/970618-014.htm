That's the usual way, I think. The inner rockers have drainage holes at the
bottom the often times get clogged, resulting in the collection of dirt and
moisture lead ign to rust.

Get the body cavity wax instead and make sure the drainage holes are clear.
Since you have a california car, most likely you're OK, so I would both
squirt cavity wax up into the clamshell from each drain hole, and also if
you remove the carpet on the inside you'll see a couple of black oval covers
that if you remove you have a little room to do some more squirting. You can
get the wax from Eastwood. Wurth also makes the stuff.
