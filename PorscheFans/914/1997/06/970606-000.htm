 74  914  1.8L  2nd owner/since 1976   many Parades and trophies.
He wants  $ 600............not a bad deal for a complete car.  Car is 
located in Pittsburgh PA.

How come now that i'm out on the West coast, the deals are popping up on
the East?  Is it some conspiracy to keep me from owning a 914?  I found
out that a completed car from BBR is gonna run me somewhere around $15K
and that's not even with the flat six engine.  Add another $10K for that!
 Damn, i didn't realize it was gonna be so much!  I might be able to cut
the costs back some, but it's still gonna be up there.  If i get the job
tomorrow i might be able to afford Pomona Sunday, if not i'm gonna have
to pass as the savings account is getting kind of bare.  I thought i
budgeted the move better than this!  Everyone keep their fingers crossed
for me!  Thanx.
Check ya laters,
