That'd probably keep you out of PCA events.

Not really different in price than doing a waterpumper conversion
properly. Emphasis on the word _properly_.

If you want to compete, you really need to start with a fairly stock car
and _then_ determine what class (or classes) you want to play in.

I'd say they're good for autox. But I wouldn't keep 'em on the street. I
was kinda thinking of just getting a set of 15X8 or so fuchs and
adapting them to my hubs for the autox. They're really no different than
wheel spacers. But I don't think I'd want 'em for track or street. Then
again, I really don't have any experience with them and all my opinions
about them are based on rumor and second hand knowledge. All I know
about 'em is that the'd be a legal way for me to use five lug wheels in
my class. Anyone else out there have more knowledge about adapters?
