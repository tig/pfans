Yes, remove all the connectors on the brain harness (label them if you
don't have any reference material) and remove the brain.

The harness that comes into the "brain" breaks out onto a spade-type 
connector if memory serves (it's been a few years).  There should be
a small plastic (white) cover over where the harness connects to the
brain.  Remove the clamp where the harness enters the brain and then
slide the plastic cover off.  You should then be able to pull the 
connector from the brain.

Using a wiring diagram and a multi-meter, you can trace all of the brain
connections to ensure they are good.  Make sure to also test for shorts
between wires in the harness - it can be time-consuming.

I was tempted to make a new harness when I first go into doing this 
myself.  I imagine there would be a market for it if anyone ever 
decided to do it.

It's difficult sometimes not to get frustrated.  I was there this 
weekend when finshing up underneath my car after putting the 
engine back in (stubborn heat exchanger + shop did bad job on 
helicoil = difficult re-fitting exchanger).  I just took a break,
thought about the it, and re-approached it with the proper solution.

Once it does run well, you'll have the satisfaction, pride and 
additional knowledge and experience to show for it....
