To summarize my "spring" project, I have acquired from list members and
installed:

(1) 19mm master cylinder
(2) front calipers
(3) front lines from the master cylinder to the calipers
(4) 15 x 7-inch "steelie" wheels

Now that everything is installed, I have spent the last 3 days attempting to
bleed the system (bringing up a whole other set of questions).  While doing
so, I have made the following observations:

(1) The Clymer manual says that the rear brakes have an "outer" and an
"inner" bleeder valve.
(2) The Haynes manual says that the rears have a single bleeder valve on the
inside near the top.

When checking MY rear calipers, the left rear caliper has 2 bleeders on the
inside (top and bottom), like a front caliper, and the right rear has a
single bleeder near the top.

Other than the bleeder locations, the rear calipers are identical.

Are any of these the correct calipers for my 75 2.0 ???

Flummoxed as always,
Jeff Dunning
