This is what I did. I don't think the bearings were ruined. The seals 
maybe, but I do know that I couldn't get the play out of them afterward 
when I put a stub axle back in and tightened the "big nut" real tight 
(but not up to spec). I don't know if the bearing was ruined, but since I 
couldn't inspect it with ruining it, I just decided to replace them. 
After I got them out, the races were fine. The grease was a little old 
and the seals had leaked, but the bearing was fine. Anyway, live and learn.
