Dirk-
When I pulled off my stock springs I...
pulled the whole unit out, 
loosened the top nut,
supported the bottom of the shock in a sidewalk crack, 
put my spare tire and wheel on top, 
and thru the center hole of the wheel I unscrewed the top nut.
It came off with just a little pop, but the spring had very little force
at that point.
A friend of mine gave me the idea.  He does all his Macphersons this way.
(Another friend broke his jaw on a Mac strut using compressers)
You can also use the spare to push the spring back down to get the nut
started.
The 140# springs I now have don't even need the spare.
Hope it works as well for you!
