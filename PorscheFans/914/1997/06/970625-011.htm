Andy,

I had asked that question.  The basic response was to either buy the
tools (~80 via Eastwood, or $100+ via Snap-On), or go to a local shop
and have them make them.  I was lucky enough to find a local shop
willing to make them for $3 each, so I opted that route.  That's about
all the info I got; I know it's not likely to help much....

Good luck...
Mike
