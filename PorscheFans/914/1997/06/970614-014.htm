  Paul Lyman is, I believe, correct... there is no reason for a polarity 
requirement in a simple solenoid, for exactly the reasons that he 
elucidates.  The reason that the connector is polarized is that there are 
many applications for standardized connectors (which these are) that 
do require polarity to be observed, so standard connectors always 
have a keying arrangement to guarantee proper insertion.  To get 
connectors which were unkeyed, would require that Porsche purchase 
(at additional cost) a specialized connector.  Hence, the keyed 
connectors are used even if the specific application does not require 
them.

  The only exception that would require polarity to be observed is if the 
armature in the injector were not soft iron, but a magnet itself.  This is 
done in some relays to make them more sensitive, or enable them to 
latch, or to alter their release time characteristics.  If the injectors were 
so constructed, then they would indeed behave as Dirk suggests, and 
would be polarity sensitive.  
  Since I have operated mine using a bench power supply without 
regard to polarity, and spliced in a replacement injector "end", again 
without paying the slightest attention to polarity, and with no ill effects, I 
must conclude that it is unlikely that Bosch D-Jet injectors are polarity 
sensitive.

  Thanks for all the input.
                              Regards,
                              Jim T.
