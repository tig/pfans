I want to thank everyone again for all of the help and advice that I've
received over the past few weeks with my car.  I'd like to reiterate
that no response is too long...  My mail server has been down, but I've
been keeping up on the web site.

I've taken the side off of my computer, and was relived to see the wires
and connector inside look brand new, with no signs of becoming brittle
or corroded.  I also stripped off the tube that has surrounded the wires
exiting the computer.  For a little while, I thought I had found the
problem.  The PO had whittled away at seven of the wires, slicing the
insulation off to measure conductivity, I assume.  The exposed wires had
been shoddily wrapped in electrical tape, but the bare wire was visible
on two of them.  I removed all of the old electrical tape, cleaned the
wires and insulation, and re-wrapped them in fresh electrical tape.
Starting the car, however, resulted in the same behavior.  My computer
is now sitting on my rear trunk, with all of the wires exposed from the
terminal in the computer down to their individual connections at the
various sensors.  If I grab the wires about a foot down from the
computer to hold them steady, and shift the computer around, it has no
effect on the engine's performance.  I feel this is good, since it
appears that the computer and its connections are not to blame.  I can,
however, move the wires anywhere between the MPS and the spot I had held
them while checking the computer, and get the same changes in
performance to occur.  I cannot describe the frustration associated with
knowing that the only reason I'm not driving my car on this beautiful
day is because of some loose wires.  The only things that I have left to
try are;

1.  Tracing the connections from the MPS back to the computer to verify
that they are correct.
2.  Re-crimping the head temp sensor to the harness (it doesn't look too
pretty)

After that, I'm not too sure what else I can do.  Is there any
"professional" way to fix those seven whittled wires?  Running my car in
this condition (continuous smoke from the exhaust) while trying to
figure this out isn't going to cause any permanent damage, is it?  If I
can't figure this out, would I be better off taking the car to my local
P-car shop, or to a shop that specializes in electrical problems?

Thanks again for all of the help, it's the only reassurance I've got
right now...
