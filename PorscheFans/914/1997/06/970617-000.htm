 First, what is the best way to remove the pistons from the rear calipers? 
You use the adjusters to back them out. If they are stuck, or get stuck
during this process, grip the end of the piston with a pair of pliers to
wiggle it free. 

 Third, I had to pull my transmission out to repair the clutch, since
re-installing it the car jumps out of first when I pull away. Is there a
chance the shifter rod is out of adjustment or is it most likely the first
gear syncro assembly worn out? 

If it didnt' do that before the clutch job, then it has to be a
maladjustment in the shifter.

Fourth, can anyone tell me the thickness of the washers used to raise the
steering rack after the front end has been lowered? 

Just buy them. They are very cheap. They are custom made and metric. You
would also need longer highstrength metric bolts. The kit is something like 15$.
