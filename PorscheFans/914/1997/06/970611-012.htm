I've tried three times on three different cars now; I couldn't get them apart without removing
the stub axle.  I've always needed to pry the axle/CV apart with a screwdriver due to the
gasket and the roll pins.  The roll pin mods sound like a good idea to me.  Maybe each car
is individual in this respect as well?

This is correct; the inner race is two-piece.  Without the stub axle in place to keep
the hub located, it is possible for the bearing to come apart by having the hub move
up/down (relative to the way it rotates).  You do not want to move the car without the
stub axle in place; of course, if you do need to move it, just stick the stub axle in
place and loosely tighten it.  That should suffice...
