Greetings Fourteeners,
Drove to Willow springs last sunday to take in what was left of the
"Tribute to Lemans" gathering...
walking around the Paddock, I came across a nicely done '73 914 2.0l.  This
guy had what appeared to be a new brand coat of green/gold metallic paint
(NOT the factory optional gold either-this was a slightly greener, much
brighter shade) fresh rubber everywhere, clean chrome and it just generally
looked real good.  Whoever painted it had the foresight to remove the front
side markers as well - that looked real tidy...anyway;

Anybody here familiar with this car?  (...Is this YOUR car I'm describing?)

You see, I am very curious about the tires that were on it...he was wearing
205/55 Goodyear Eagles mounted on the std 4-lug Fuch Alloys.  The car's
fenders all appeared stock...I don't THINK the inner lips had been rolled,
but  I really neglected to look for that...

I'm gonna need new rubber in the not-too-distant future...Does anyone have
any comments/experiences with a tire that low & wide on the Fuch Alloy?
(which is what I have)

Right now I'm driving on std junk VW Beetle tires and I would like to do a
quantum-leap upgrade when "retiring" comes around.

Any thoughts?  all are welcome, and thanks.

Cheers
Thom Kuby
