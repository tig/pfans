Keith, if you would like to return the kit I will label all of the hoses
for you. My elementary vacuum cartoon included with the kit is usually
suffice in most applications  I am sorry that it did not work for you.
Also please remember that the 1.8 needs tightly fitting hoses for a sealed
vacuum system, to the extent that some of the hoses need to be installed
with soapy water.  In fact the largest size hose is no longer available in
the states so we had to special order a minimum ten year supply from
Germany!
