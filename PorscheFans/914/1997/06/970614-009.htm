Well, After nearly one year of ownership on my '75 2.0, I was lying
under the car contemplating the pushrod tube seal renewal job when I
banged on the rocker, and a cloud of dirt, dust and mouse nest material
started to filter out of the rocker. When I finally pulled the passenger
side rocker panel I found the expected rusted out jack point, and some
thin spots near the top of the inner rocker(near and just to the rear of
the jack point) and along the middle of the sill. The rocker itself was
perforated and thin, and will have to be replaced. The driver side
appears to be about the same, with some what more rust further forward
than the passenger side. My questions: Has anyone used the reinforcing
panels that Brad Mayeur is offering out of his Peroria, Il shop, as
advertised in the 914 Renegade club's Twin Trunks magazine? How hard to
install, and how thorough a repair job is this for damage as described
above? Secondly, when replacing rocker panels, is steel the only right
way to go, or are the fiberglas rockers a sensible, invisible
alternative? Copy to the list or to me at JIm914@CCR.NET. TIA.
