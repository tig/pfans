Thanks Dirk and Dave.   I saw the body cavity wax listed with the wand in a
couple of catalogs. That's what I meant rather than the undercoating stuff.
I didn't know about the access spots in the top of the clamshell section.
I haven't removed my old carpet yet and didn't bother with the ratty stuff
in the old parts car I no longer have. Will definitely check those out in
my car.  I was thinking about using POR-15 if I see surface rusting in
there. Should be able to hit most of it, even with the heater tube in
there.  If looks ok with no visible rust then I'll use the wax.

Hopefully I'll see no rust in there (I can dream :-)  and not find much
with the ice pick test when under the car.  Then I'll be more confident
that it is window mechanism or door alignment rather than body sag and I
can adjust them.
