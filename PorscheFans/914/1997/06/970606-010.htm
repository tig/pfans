OK, the inspiriation for this tool was to not have to hammer
the rear wheel bearing into the trailing arm. It's a simple
threaded rod that "squishes" the trailing arm and bearing
so the bearing goes into the arm.

I used a 2 foot piece of 1/2" threaded rod, a 4 foot
piece of 1" square steel tubing, a couple of nuts and
a few washers. I chose 1/2" threaded rod because
the largest hole I can easily make is 1/2". When the
tool is finished, it will be an "L" shaped thing where
the short part of the "L" is the threaded rod.

Take the tubing and cut off 2 pieces, 1 about 8"
(or a little bit longer than the inner axle opening in
the trailing arm) and the other about a foot. Drill
a 1/2" hole in the middle of the 8" piece (square
to the tubing). Also drill 1/2" holes about 4" from
one end of each of the other 2 pieces. You should
have an 8" piece with a hole in the middle, a 1 foot
piece with a hole near the end, and 2'4" piece also
with a hole near the end. Take the threaded rod and
thread 1 nut about 4" up the rod. Put a washer on next.
Then the 8" piece, then the 2'4" piece. Then another
washer, then a another nut. Take a couple of 19mm
wrenches and tighten the whole stack very tight.
This is your "L" shaped piece. I needed 2 pieces of
steel tubing because just one isn't strong enough.

Prepare the bearing hole by sanding all rust, wiping
clean and applying a very thin layer of antisieze.
Prepare the tool by applying grease over a 1 foot
section approximately in the middle of the threaded
rod.

The trailing arm should be completely bare. Remove
everything including the shock bolt. Remove the disc
backing plate and the bolts from the wheel bearing
cover. Of course, the caliper is off, too.

OK, while sitting to the outside of the trailing arm, insert
the threaded rod part of the tool through the trailing arm
bearing hole from the backside. Let the tubing part extend towards the =
rear of the car and
rest on the floor. Insert the bearing with the threaded
rod extending through the hole towards the outside.
Take the last piece of tubing and slide it onto the
threaded rod. Slide at least one washer next, and then
thread on a nut, Thread the nut fairly close to the
bearing and then look around on the back side of
the trainling arm and notice that the axle tube opening
is not square with the wheel bearing mount. Find a
lump of something (I used a spare nut) to put between
the rear part of the 8" piece and the trailing arm so that
the threaded rod extends perpendicularly to the wheel
bearing mouting surface. Once you found a suitable
piece, hold it in place with one hand while you tighten
the nut on the threaded rod to take up the rest of the
slack. Once it's snug and you're confident the rod is
squared up, begin tightening the nut. Hold the outer
tubing piece to keep everything lined up while you
tighten the nut. The bearing should begin to move into
the arm in "jerks" or "pops." Keep tightening until the
wheel bearing is fully seated into the arm. Once it's
seated, undo everything and sit back and admire
your handiwork!

Let me know if anyone needs more info.
