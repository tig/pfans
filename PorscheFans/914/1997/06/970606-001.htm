WHAT!!!!! What are you looking for? A perfect 100 concourse car? Geez,
even with all the race prepping I've done to my car I doubt that I've
spent that much, including the purchase price. What are you having done
to warrant such a price tag?

Kevin, if you're patient and keep looking, especially in So Cal, you can
probably find a really good condition car for less than half that price
tag. Hell, I could probably find a nice 911E for that much. Keep
looking. They ARE out there.
