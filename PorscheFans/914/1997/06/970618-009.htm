It has become apparent to me my message may have lacked a degree of
coherency.  So here it goes again.

Don noted:  That he watched a Rich Johnson kit being installed on a car
that was placed on a lift and did not use door braces, and it came out
fine.

What I wanted to say:
This may be due to the location of the lift points.  If you lift a car
from the middle the 914 will either stay where it was chassis wise, or
the door gap will open up.  This is due to the pickup points and the
weight of the body shell its self.  Well really gravity.  If you mount
one on a rotisserie, you need to use the door bars due to the  mount
points used but the lift.

Lets look at it this way.  You have a piece of construction paper.  If
you pick it up at for distributed points from the center out (like the
lift points on a 914)  The ends will flex down by a small amount.  If you
pick it up from the four corners (like a rotisserie) it will flex down in
the middle.  Since the paper is a 914 the flex in the middle would be the
door opening, which it would close up.  There fore you need to have the
door braces to keep the chassis from flexing.

My car is in great shape, I use the 4x4 frame to move it about the
garage, but that is for convenience only.  And allows me great access to
areas I would not get to with suspension or jack stands in the way.

I tend to take every precaution I can with welding this car, I don't want
to distort it and ruin a good shell.  So I added the 2x4 door bars just
to be sure.  And then I measure everything, and recheck them all the time
during the welding process.

Now if it has a bad case of rust termites, I would build a jig and mount
the car to it.  Take the time to do it right and it will turn out
correct.  If you are going to slap it together, you might as well use
peanut butter and rubber bands.  Just my opinion of course, but then its
not worth anything. <g>

You can do it so many ways that and none are wrong each situation needs
its own solution.  Maybe all those years at college finally paid off,
nah, I must be dreaming.  

I hope this clears up what I wrote.  then again, maybe I just muddied the
waters.
