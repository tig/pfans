Thanks to those who resonded to my questions in the past, this is an =
incredibly helpful and friendly list. I`m getting down to the nitty =
gritty know and I have a few things to resolve. First, what is the best =
way to remove the pistons from the rear calipers? Second, when I started =
my engine the hoses to the injectors leaked. I removed the old hoses and =
replaced them,but I would really like to replace the hoses with molded =
fuel line hoses that have a 90 degree bend in them. Is such a hose =
available? Third, I had to pull my transmission out to repair the =
clutch, since re-installing it the car jumps out of first when I pull =
away. Is there a chance the shifter rod is out of adjustment or is it =
most likely the first gear syncro assembly worn out? Fourth, can anyone =
tell me the thickness of the washers used to raise the steering rack =
after the front end has been lowered? Lastly, has anyone out there =
installed a short shift kit on there 914? I`d like a little feeback to =
hear what you have to say about how well it did or did not work.
TIA                Mark Selkirk.
