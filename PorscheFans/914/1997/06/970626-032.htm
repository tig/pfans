The Speedo was set for neither it was set for mid point, and like most 
speeds of its time was only acuract for a narrow band. My bet is that it is 
only trustworthy between 30 - 60. I run the 205/60's and I use the gear 
chart to tell me what my speeds are based on the Tach. Anyhow I can't see 
the Speedo from 30 - 80 due to small wheel. Yes your honor I could not see 
the Speedo at 55 so I pushed it to 80 so I could see it.

The choice of tires should be based on your power band, and where you want 
to get the most out of your car.

Tall tires work fines with low end toqure, get god top end speed, and save 
gas.
Short tires move up the rpm's faster, letting you get off the line and 
corners faster.

For street tires I would use 195/60's a little shorter than stock, cheaper 
to buy (hot size), gets off the line, and keeps your top end down to 108 
mph at 5800 rpm which is plenty fast for the street, but still enough to 
get a really BIG ticket.

If I was worried about speed I would calculate the speed from gearing chart 
apply the delta % and post it on my tach for 4th & 5th.

Ok that explains it.  Another question though.  Was the speedometer then
set up for the 165/80 or 175/80?  I want a larger profile tire, considering
the 195/65 Yoko A509's mentioned in other emails. I'd like to keep the
speedo as close to accurate as possible since this will be mainly a street
car.  The delta between a 165 and 175 is about 5%,
