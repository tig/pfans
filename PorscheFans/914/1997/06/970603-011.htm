Oh man, we're still talking about different things. The pmi for a car tha=
t
is sticking to the road on all four tires is defined differently from the=
 pmi
of a car that is sliding on all four tires. The pmi in the first case is =
determined
by the distance from the cm to the point between the rear wheels because =

the center of rotation in this case is between the rear wheels. In
the second case, the pmi is determined by the distribution of mass
from the cm, which becomes the center of rotation when the car transistio=
ns
from sticking to sliding. The point I was trying to make is that when the=
 car
transistions from sticking to sliding, the location of the cm determines
how the attitude of the car changes (and whether this change is
dramatic or not), and how the least dramatic change would occur
when the cm was near the center point between the rear wheels
(as in midengined cars) I didn't mean to say anything about
anything else.

The one with the least pmi will be equally easy to stop and to start
spinning, of course. That's just simple newton's laws.

I wasn't interested in that problem. I was only discussing what happens =

during the transition from sticking to sliding and the influence of the =
cm
and pmi.

This contradicts your statement above. If the car is easy to spin, then =
it must
be just as easy to stop from spinning. Also, the type of car with large =
masses
at each end (a large free-space pmi) would be harder to start spinning =
as you
pointed out, but just as hard to stop from spinning.

Man, this thread is getting out of hand. (too much pmi :)
