	There were several different versions of the speedo over the
years.  At one point at least, the only difference between two of the
versions was that one was calibrated for 165R15 tires, while the other
was calibrated for 175R15 tires.
	If you really want to keep the speedo accurate, you can have
a good VDO shop (like N. Hollywood speedo or Palo Alto speedo) re-
calibrate yours for you.  That way you can just pick the tires you
want and change the speedo to match.
	BTW, I heard on the list a few years ago that the "assumed"
profile when no number is mentioned is 78.  Why 78?  I dunno.  But
that would make the stock tires 165/78-15.  80 is pretty close...
