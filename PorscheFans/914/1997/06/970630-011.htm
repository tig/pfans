I missed the thread that Thwen & Bernie are referring to, but I got the
gist of what was being talked about.

I gather there is something about refill of fluid in the transaxle
(pretty bright of me, Huh?   :-)    ).

Well here are a couple suggestions, to add if you want to try something
different than Thwen's liquid laundry detergent pump.

If you DON'T have an electric drill:  most auto parts houses sell a
device that looks like a one-piston shock absorber.  You're the motive
power behind it.  It has a push - pull handle on one end, operating the
piston inside the cylinder (holds between a pint and a quart), and there
is a hose at the other end.  I think you have the idea.  If you have a
difficult time finding one of these, and you want it, even after reading
about the next option, post me back, and I'll give you a name of one of
the many vendors who service the industry I work in, and I'm sure they'll
come up with one for you.  We inelligently call it a "Hand-Heald Diff
Sucker".

If you DO have an electric drill:  most any hardware store would have a
diaphram-type sypon pump that hooks into your electric drill, and to
quote Thwen "viola", it sucks and spits, depending on which hose you put
where.  I have one at home in my shop and have used it for years.  Can
get brand name if you so desire.  A trip to the hardware store would
suffice.  Your handy dandy (usually higher-priced) local tool man on a
truck probably has some such device also.
