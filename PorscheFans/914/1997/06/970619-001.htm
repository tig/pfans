Dave:

When I was faced with essentially the same dilemna last year (too
much money, not enough mid-engined sports cars in my garage), I
bought an NSX... You can find a few-years-old example with under 15K
miles for about what it'd cost to build your proposed luxo 914/3.6.

The 914's a great car and all, but it sounds as though you're going
to spend a lot of time and money trying to turn it into something
that performs as well as an NSX but is more uncomfotable, harder to
drive, and uglier... I can CERTAINLY understand the whole Porsche
mystique/elitism thing, but you might want to think about
test-driving an NSX before making the final decision on building
another 914-6.
