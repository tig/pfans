  This sounds like a defective alternator to me.  I have the advantage of 
being given an Interauto publication specifically dealing with Bosch 
electrical systems, and the simplified diagram of the Bosch alternator 
charging circuit leads me to suspect the alternator as the cause.

  If you have a Haynes book, it is much simpler to look at the '74 model 
year diagram on page 175 than to wade through the '73 diagram, but I 
am pretty sure the actual charging systems are the same.

  If you look at the diagram for item C (the alternator itself) you will note 
that there are three sets of diodes.  The ones drawn to the right of the 
3-phase star winding in the center of the "C" item section are the main 
three phase rectifier diodes that provide the main DC output of the 
alternator.  To the left of the star winding and slightly above it are three 
more diodes that connect to the "D+" terminal on the regulator.  These 
diodes, together with three of the six main diodes constitute a second 

three-phase rectifier system whose sole purpose is to supply the field 
current for the alternator.  It sounds as though you have lost one or 
more of these diodes.

  When the alternator is operating normally, the voltage at the "D+" point 
and the voltage at the "B+" point (the battery) are essentially identical, 
because they are virtually the same thing electrically: they are the + 
end of a three-phase solid-state rectifier system off the star armature 
winding of the alternator.  The alternator idiot light is connected 
between these two points, and since they are at the same potential, 
there is no potential difference across the light, and no current flows 
through it; the light is dark.
  If something happens to the main set of diodes, the efficiency of the 
alternator will decrease (markedly), a potential difference will then exist 
across the two points mentioned above, and the light illuminates.

  In your case, suppose that something happens to one or more of the 
second set of diodes, the ones that provide the "D+" field source.  For 
light load conditions, there will still be enough field current available to 
provide alternator output, but the VOLTAGE at the "D+" point will be 
LESS than the main output of the alternator, lighting the light.  (The 
alternator output will be minimal at reduced speeds, hence, even 
though the "D+" point is low in voltage, so is the battery, so there is no 
potential difference across the light, and it does not light.)

  When you turn the headlights on, the increased load on the system is 
more than the alternator can produce, because of it's diminished field 
source.  Hence, the battery voltage drops, and the voltages at the "B+" 
(battery) point and the "D+" (field source) are again equal, 
extinguishing the light.

  When you provide external field source from the battery, you of course 
completely bypass the extra set of diodes that provide the field current, 
and the alternator reaches full output.  The wire probably gets hot for 
two reasons: one is  because at least one of the extra diodes is 
shorted, producing a low resistance path to ground, and two, the 
alternator field winding is not designed to run at a full 12 volts for an 
extended period of time; as you noted, this condition is absolute 
maximum output.  The field winding is normally regulated to a lower 
voltage by the voltage regulator to control the alternator's output.

  I am sorry to have to tell you that you need to do as difficult a job as 
changing out an alternator on a 914, but it sure looks like that is the 
cause.  I also don't know how to prove it, apart from having the 
alternator tested by an auto electric shop (be sure to tell them that you 
suspect the second set of diodes, or they will probably miss it) or just 
replacing the thing.  If you go to all the trouble of removing it, I would 
suggest that you replace it anyhow, just because it is so difficult to get 
at.  Unfortunately, I do not know how to test it for sure in situ, so you will 
have to decide for yourself if you want to undertake the work.
  In other words, all the usual disclaimers apply... I think that I have 
discovered a reasonable explanation for your symptoms, but please 
don't send me a bomb in the mail if it turns out I am wrong!

  Good luck with your project.

                              Regards,
                              Jim T.
