Opinions:

	Dealer installed air deducts from the value.  I've seen the damage
	done by installation.

	Dual Webers is a bad thing.  In California, they would cost me
	almost a grand to get rid of.  Which I would have to do if I ever
	wanted to drive the car.

	It may not be the shift coupler.  I've driven (owned) 914's with
	almost NO linkage, and was still able to make them go.

	Checy valves in a 914 do NOT give me a warm and fuzzy feeling.

More opinions:

	Carpet is cheap.  And easy to install.

	These cars always have a little rust.  A lot of rust is a bad
	thing.  Was the rust repaired properly?

Bottom line:

	This is a "fair" price, but not a great, (or even good) price.  There
	will be another.  The biggest test would be the "smile on the face"
	test, which you can only get with a test ride.

	It may be a good thing that you can't test drive it.  The first time
	I drove a 2.0, I was hooked, and bought it.  "It" was a POS.
