Hey Jeff,

I think it is unfortunately going to go to the "giant smog II overhaul"
package. :(  It won't be signed individually, but combined into another
bill.

Which means they will somehow turn it into something bad for us,
I think. :(

Reuters had a brief story about it...

Monday June 16 8:01 PM EDT
Old car smog exemption bill approved
SACRAMENTO, June 16 (UPI) _ The Assembly Transportation Committee has
approved a Senate bill that
would exempt cars at least a quarter century old from California smog
inspections, which are required every
two years.
The panel voted 14-0 to advance the bill by Sen. Quentin Kopp, I-San
Francisco. It would supersede
present law, which exempts vehicles made in the 1966 model year, and
earlier. The bill is expected to eventually land in a two-house conference
committee
that is handling legislation related
to California's Smog Check program.
Supporters told lawmakers today that the program's present requirement
falls hard on collectors who drive
their cars very little, and on poor people who cannot afford newer
vehicles. The state Air Resources Board says about 200,000 cars are in the
25-
year-or older category, and are
capable of producing two tons of air- polluting emissions every day.
But proponents say the amount is negligible compared with the 1,100 tons
emitted every day in the South
Coast Air Quality Management District.
The Bureau of Automotive Repair says exempting the cars from air pollution
requirements would cost the
state $1.8 million in first fiscal year and up to $4.2 million by 1998-99.
