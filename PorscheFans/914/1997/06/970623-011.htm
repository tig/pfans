Good suggestion - I'll give it a second look.  (Easy to see - I've got
an
extension hose for the pressure sender).

Don't think so from where it is dripping - it's up front.  Besides the
rate
of the drip (no drips w/engine off) seems to indicate is in the
pressurized
part of the oil system - somewhere where there is a galley.

Good idea, and I should shoot myself for not pulling the impellor hub
and
checking when I was working on the pump (was so sure that was it). 
However,
I thought that when a front seal went, the oil gets sucked into the
impellor
and then, well, creates quite a mess up top.

I agree.  Thanks for the advice,
