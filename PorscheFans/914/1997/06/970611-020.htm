As a former VP, USA, would say, "One word: Delete Key." :P

CaliPunk, 

We're pretty specific in our Subject lines, so you should be able to
filter out threads you aren't interested in quite easily.  You could
also look into going to Digest mode.

A lot of the great info that circulates here is well beyond my current
technical ability or understanding.  But I and my P-car a) appreciate
the time someone took to type it all out for us, and b) will definitely
benefit from those (sometimes) lengthy descriptions in the long run.

And, y'know, a lengthy email doesn't really "use up" my screen.  It
ain't papyrus, after all.

Good luck!
Thwen.
