There seems to be a little confusion here. First, the outer decortive part
is called the "rocker panel" and the inner structural part is either called
the "inner rocker" or the "clamshell." You can get the outer rocker panels
in either steel or fiberglass. Fiberglas is fine for that part. But, the
structural inner rocker is only steel and must remain only steel, and yes it
is a really big job to repair it. If you can find a good bodyman at 40$ per
hour, then you can figure at least 500-1,000$ per side. The car has to be
put into a jig to hold it true while the old part is removed and a new one
is welded in. The outer clamshell rocker can be had for about 100$ each. But
that's just the part. The big part is making sure the car is straight both
before and after. At this point, your car probably is bent from the lack of
structural support. Only putting the car on a frame jig will you really know.
