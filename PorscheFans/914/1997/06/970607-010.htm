An advantage for us short and lighter weight folks! :)

With driver and 1/3 tank.

LF-502  RF-468
LR-652  RR-615

weight without driver 2106, 2237 w/driver

Cross: 50.0% 1120
Left:  51.5% 1154
Rear:  56.6% 1267

So as you can see, I have an even more rearward bias than Micheal. And I
too have a 30lb driver weight bias. Step one is moving the batery up
front and changing it to an itty bitty motorcycle batery. Hey, any
battery is legal in my class, and that's a big weight savings right
there. I've got an optima right now, and they're heavy suckers.

The car has yet to go through a thorough lightening. But there's not a
whole lot more I can do and stay legal.

Getting a header system is the very next thing I plan on doing, and that
should save me a fair bit of weight.
