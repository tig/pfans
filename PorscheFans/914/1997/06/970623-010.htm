Jerry,

I hope you've already checked the oil pressure light switch on top of the
engine to the rear of the distributor.  This thing is often the source of
mysterious
oil leaks, but the oil usually drips off the bottom of the oil filter.

Otherwise, it may be a pushrod tube.  Check by jacking car up on stands,
removing the bottom sheet metal from the engine, and running it.  You can
usually see a pushrod tube leak.  You may want to wash off the bottom of
the engine before you start it--I use brake kleen + compressed air to clean
up, you can also use engine cleaner + water.

If you can't find the leak, and it comes from the very front of the engine,
then it *might* be the front seal, which requires engine r&r.  I dunno if
*I'd* try to just lower the front of the engine--it's easier to drop the
whole thing--only 3 more bolts.  Then you can work on the sucker without
being a contortionist.  It'll be *much* faster and less stressful this way.

The main thing is to crawl under and find the leak with the engine running,
and bottom tin removed (so you can see!)

Hope this helps

cheers, Brian
