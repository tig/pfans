Dion,

There should be a recessed area directly above your brake line support
bracket.  The hard line to flex line bracket attached to the body.  It is
not very deep, but that is where it is.  Take a magnet to this area, does
it stick?  If no somebody may have covered it up, bondo, seam sealer,
fiberglass, a piece of wood you live in the Mid West after all.<g>

If that does not work, pull the gas tank, you should before you weld
anyway. Now hopefully you can see the dimpled area.  I would make a
cardboard pattern of the reinforcement plate.  Mark it with center lines,
and hole spacing.  Drill, the plate with four holes at the true center
for each mount whole and swaybar pass through hole.  Note: this is a
small hole just big enough for the point of a center punch to penetrate
and dimple the metal.  The large the whole the less accurate it will be. 
Next put it into the car and see what fits best.  Note: you will have to
notch the shelf to allow the bottom 1 nut and plate to lower down into
the area below the ledge.  In the tank well area you will see a ledge on
the front side (front of the car), it may only be on the passenger side. 
The bar is mounted above this ledge. 

Next mark the two top mount holes and the center whole for the bar to pas
thru, with a center punch.  Drill the three marked holes with a pilot bit
1/8" or what ever you have that is sharp and small. Take your pattern and
transfer the lower hole to outside marks.  Drill this one for the fender
side.  Next step up your bit sizes for the mount holes and use a hole saw
for the larger swaybar hole.  Or you can use a chassis punch, Eastwood
sells a nice basic set, less than $40.00.  Finish drilling holes to the
appropriate sizes.  Clean the metal around your welds are going to be. 
Repeat for the other side.

Do a trail fit of the swaybar, make sure it is not bound or cocked at a
weld angle.  Remove the bar, bolt down just the plates and weld into
place.  Paint the area with a good rust prevention paint.  Let that dry,
then finish the bar install.  REinstall the gas tank.

Take care,
Stephen Jacobs
