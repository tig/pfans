After engine removal to fix the melling oil pump leak and
lots of while I'm in theres, I finished buttoning up the
engine and started it this weekend.

1st crank and vrooom!  Was a pleasure to have it start 
on the first crank.  The other piece of good news is that
the engine has never run better and the new air/fuel
meter works great - running at about 14:1 just enough on 
the rich side for a little more power.  Might actually read
a voltage sometime...I've heard that .86V (14.86:1) is the
mixture for maximum power output.

So, while the engine was out I discovered that pushrod tube
keeper spring misrouting problem which probably explains why
the engine runs so well now - 

BUT: MY ENGINE IS STILL LEAKING OIL!  Not just a drip mind you
but a drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, more oil in, drip, drip, drip.

It appears to be coming from the front part of the crankcase and
during idle collects near the oil filter flange and runs down to
drip off of the slotted cover for one of the pressure relief pistons.

I AM ON A MISSION FROM GOD TO FIX THIS LEAK.  Someone earlier had
posted that they were able to drop the front of the engine down for
access in fixing a leak in such an area.  I am planning on doing the
same after to crawl under the car while its running to see if I cant
spot the exact source.

Since it'll drip, drip, drip, at idle that shouldn't be a problem.
If I have to get deeper into the engine to find it - would it be 
possible (or prudent) to drop the front of the engine remove the
fan shroud/alternator (will there be room?) and try to find the
leak by cranking (running?) the engine?

I'll find and fix this leak even if it requires me to bathe in the
dripping, hot oil......

Any insight, suggestions and/or consolations appreciated.
