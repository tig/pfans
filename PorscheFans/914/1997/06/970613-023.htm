I don't think that it is an oil break-down concern. More of a case and
ring damage kindof problem. I don't have alot of knowledge about what
hapens to aluminum case VW/Porsche wet sump motors when they get too
hot, but would suspect that if the oil is that hot, it's also
trasnfering that heat to the case. And if the case gets too hot, it
expands too much and can cause lots of problems there, also rings can
get burned and the like. But like I said, I don't know too much of what
exactly happens inside these motors when cooked too much, so I'm making
some guesses. But I do seem to remember that sustained overheating will
lead to a loss of oil pressure, compression, and leaks. And as hot as
the oil and case are, the heads are much hotter.
