Dirk:

I ran 195/55/15s (maybe only available in Japan) on my 194 with 5.5
Fuchs alloys until I switched to 205/50s. Both fit. There was some
inside rubbing at full lock on one side in front, but probably an
alignment problem. As Sean at Auto Atlanta told me, "just don't turn
full lock at speed". It's the same now on my C2, different wheels,
though :-). First, the lower the aspect ratio the better they fit, in my
experience. The big unknown is the ATS vs. Fuchs offsets.

Still can't decide which to sell.
