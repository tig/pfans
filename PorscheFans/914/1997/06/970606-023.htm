    Yes, David, BUT...

    All those pieces ae 30 years old; they'll probably need a fair
    amount of reconditioning or rebuilding.

    Also, the 1967 911 front suspension doesn't offer much that you
    don't already have; the aluminum crossmember and light alloy "S"
    calipers weren't introduced until years later.

    If I were you, I'd just put the 911 struts on the 914 and look
    for a pair of alloy "S" calipers to mount to them.  Keep in mind
    that the 911 brakes will require 5-lug 911 wheels.

    Famous last words...

    1991 cc... Usually referred to as a 2-liter.

    If it's a normal 911, 130 HP; if it's a 911S, 160.
