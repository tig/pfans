An interesting problem just fixed at Heckman & Thieman in Port. OR (good
people!).  The Pertronics wire within the distrib had cracked but wire cover was
o.k.so break didn't show.  When the retard was activated by taking foot off of
accel. pedal, it pulled the wire and the connection broke, the RPMs dropping to
zero!! and firing stopped.  When gas was applied, retard mechanism quit, no
pulling on wire and distributor was "reconnected"!! RPMs resumed and power back.
 I tried to figure this out for two days!!! I'll try points for awhile!!!!  

Question, did I hear right that the vacuum retard is not needed and decreases
efficiency of motor?
