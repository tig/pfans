Well, it looks like they changed it again.  It had been all Porsches
through =


the '74 year, but now it's only the *expensive* ones.  Us NARPs are left
out

in the cold.

Special Directive Allows Some Vehicles Failing Smog Test at 2500 rpm to

                       Receive Certificates at Referee


    A special directive was recently issued by BAR allowing certain
Porsches, and some other import models, to be

    issued a smog certificate even if they fail the emissions test at
the 2500 rpm standard. =



    The directive applies only to the following vehicles:


         1968 74 Porsche Models 911 and 912 =


         1970 71 Porsche Model 914/6; and =


         1966 67 imported models equipped with air cooled engines,
multiple carburetors or mechanical fuel

         injection. =



    "The Bureau has discovered that some of these vehicles may be unable
to meet the 2500 rpm emission standards

    due to the original design of the vehicle=92s emission control
system," said BAR=92s Smog Check Chief of Staff Leon

    Vann, Jr. =



    The affected vehicles must still pass the visual, functional and
idle portion of the tailpipe test in order to receive a

    certificate of compliance, Vann added, and they must fail an initial
inspection before the owner can make a Referee

    appointment. =



    "When these vehicles get to Referee Centers, and they pass the
visual, functional, and idle tailpipe tests, the

    special procedures we=92ve designed will allow them to be issued a
certificate," he said. =



    Even though the test results from the affected vehicles will not be
used to determine compliance, the data from the

    failed 2500 rpm tailpipe tests will be collected and reviewed by
BAR. =
