Regarding Stephen Jacobs' comment on models of 914s, if any of you guys
want a model built for you, I have a friend here who is a professional
model builder.  Great prices, and the best work I've ever seen (and I am
not biased because he's my friend).  He builds for many famous names
you'd recognize.  He'll be at the Chicago and Monterrey Historics this
year.  He was contemplating being at the Porsche Parade in San Antonio,
but it was really too small of a crowd for him.  Like I said, if you want
one built right for yourself, he will do it.  File that in your memory,
and give me a post when you need it.
