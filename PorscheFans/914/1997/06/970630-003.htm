Jeffrey:

If the situation turns out to NOT be your cable assembly, as you have
possibly guessed with the help of someone else, then here's another
possibility, as hairbrained as it may sound, this may be your problem. 
What you described didn't seem mechanical (cable) related, but more
toward fuel or electrical related (temperature affected, etc.).  So,
here's my guess at a rabbit trail you can chase, if you figure out that
your cables are fine.

I'm only passing along a guess here, but I had a problem on a '71 914 1.7
I used to own, that was similar in sound to what you're experiencing.  It
had the original F.I. in it also.

The condition was termed "hunting" by the dealership, in that the F.I.
brain was "hunting" for a proper rpm for the current ambient conditions,
but couldn't settle on one because there was a fault in the circuit which
determines such things (sensing such things as temperature, fuel
pressure, etc.).  The cause was a faulty piece in the F.I. brain /
motherboard componentry.  Now I don't remember what it is called (I'm at
my office right now - away from my workshop manuals) but once I describe
them, you can figure it out for yourself.  I believe that they were
called "relays" or some electrical term like that.  DESCRIPTION - little
black canister-looking things, about an inch high and an inch or so in
diameter.  They plug into the F.I. brain main panel panel having five or
so prongs in the bottom of them.  This board is horizontally mounted on
the left-side wall of the driver's side of engine compartment.  When you
remove the panel cover (a black bubble-ish sort of thing), you see 3 or 4
of these canister-looking thingies (great technical terms!).

Now you must remember, I had this problem back in 1977, so I'm a little
rusty on it, and my recollection may be somewhat faint, but I followed
the instructions of my dealer and the workshop manual.  I believe that I
ascertained what each of the units controlled by reading the color
electrical schematic (like one was for lighting, one was for accessories,
one was for F.I. operation, whatever etc.) and looked for one that was
good.  IMPORTANT - I put a different color dot on each one so I didn't
get them mixed up.  I believe that I was able to take one or two of them
to the dealer (VW dealer will also work as these were also used on the VW
411) to confirm my thoughts about which one was good and bad (if I took
all of them in, they would have gotten miffed at me taking up their time
as a DIYer).  It turned out that 2 of mine were bad.  I think that I was
able to switch them around, before buying a replacement, to also confirm
that the hunting condition stopped and it did.  I bought the replacements
for quite a bit less at the VW dealer.  Even so, I don't think they were
cheap.  If I remember right, I believe moisture could affect them, so the
cover was important in keeping stuff off of them, not to mention the rest
of the electricals that are involved in that board.

Dr. 914 probably has a simpler procedure / solution and a replacement
price, right Doc?  I just don't have his "Bible" with me at the office
either.
