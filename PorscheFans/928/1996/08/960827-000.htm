I don't think it's as easy as saying "Stick with brand X" and you'll
never have a problem. The plain truth (as mentioned by Judy) is you
have to inspect your wheels for signs of cracking (along with the rest
of the car) BEFORE you go out on the track.

A few years ago a Ruf wheel broke off of a 911 at Brigdgehampton's
turn 13 (last turn before the main straight). The 5 spokes were securely
mounted to the rear rotor. The outer rim part separated from the car,
and went rolling merrily on it's way into the woods. After the car stopped
spinning, the owner went into the woods and retrieved the outer part
of the wheel, with the tire still inflated. 

My $.02,
