     Hi guys,
        Posted a note about me finding a 928S(2) (Well in Europe it would 
     have been an S2.) a while ago; well it's sitting in my garage now 
     waiting for "legalization"  Drove it home on dealer plates with the 
     dealer; she drives good.
        Anyway, still haven't found a spoiler lip; I guess this means half 
     the planet that owns a 928 is looking for one...  Are there other 
     ground effects that fit and look good in its place?  Also I would be 
     interested in some other low-key ground effects such as very mild side 
     skirts.  
        I seem to have one noisy injector; is it a catastrophy to remove 
     the electrical connector to each injector in turn to establish which 
     one it is?  I just don't want to damage any controllers or brains.  It 
     is the 32 valve model with the 5 speed, so looking under the hood it 
     is a mystery how they fitted all that engine in there...  Hope I can 
     access all the injector connections without removing anything vital.
     
        Tried for ages to find an S4 for around 12k but they seem to be few 
     and far between.  The only one I found was not an honest car and 
     needed an engine rebuild (top end noisy) so I walked away; not because 
     of the engine work (although it is daunting) but because of the 
     probable price of parts needed...
     
        Anyway, if there are any other things that I should be aware of 
     with this car (apart from the $#@*?$!! alarm system "UNGO BOX") please 
     let me know.
        Cheers,  Jan
