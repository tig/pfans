In no particular order:

Tires: the stock Michelin XGT V tires were replaced with Michelin Pilot SX
MXX3 Z-rated tires in the same sizes, giving much smoother ride, much better
wet weather stick, better steering response, and even higher cornering and
braking limits. I'm contemplating moving to 17" or 18" wheels with wider
rims and using somewhat wider tires (e.g. 255-285 mm at the rear; wider
tires will fight the "Weissach axle" feature), but the stock sizes with the
new tires have yet to show practical limits (and I prefer the look of the
stock wheels).

Air intake: the stack air filter was replaced by a K&N Filtercharger. This
is a non-disposable unit (you clean and re-oil it periodically) with lower
restriction to air flow. It produced a small but seat-of-the-pants
noticeable improvement in power and response.

Oil: the crankcase is full of Amsoil Series 2000 synthetic oil in 20W50
weight. I've noticed cooler, quieter, and smoother running compared to the
case with non-synthetic oil.

Lights: all bulbs, including stop and turn signals as well as head, fog, and
driving lights, were replaced by the highest wattage units available. You
gotta see (and be seen) when you're going fast!

Comfort: a DynaMat heat reflective and sound insulating mat was installed
under the hood in place of the original foam mat, which had predictably
started to disintegrate.

Safety: a nice big fire extinguisher is mounted just behind the driver's seat.

Engine control: Autosport Designs (the place to go for service if you're
anywhere near NYC) recently did a custom reprogramming of the computers
which control fuel and ignition, with obvious results in throttle response
(even more immediate) and overall power. Custom work of this sort is a bit
more expensive, but much more effective than the generic chips sold by
Autothority and others. This is the most recent and least slight of the
enhancements. We have discussed supercharging the engine, which would
provide far more dramatic increases.

>928 is very appealing if the reliability factor is there.

This car is not just a toy; it's become my preferred touring car whenever I
don't need to carry lots of people or cargo. I turn the key, it goes. With
the work that Autosport did, it just goes faster (quite a lot actually; I
just got the raw before-and-after dyno data and need to work up equivalent
crankshaft horsepower figures, but it looks like at least another 50+ bhp
with better gas mileage and no temperament).

>928's have a reputation for being a nightmare for problems.

Not among the owners and mechanics I know. The multi-disc clutch in the
older cars can be a bit fussy, but the cars generally are known for working
and continuing to work for a long time.

The latter is quite plausible. These are complex machines (e.g., ask Richard
MIller about the electrical system) and require care, knowledge, and good
tools. The shop manual, at eight volumes and $250+, makes this very clear.
The absence of this manual (and the other requisites just mentioned) at most
garages, public and private, can lead to escalating problems of just the
sort you described with Jaguars.

Right on!

This is NOT a snob or "gold chain" issue. The 928 is flat out the least
expensive genuine supercar. Corvettes, even ZR-1s, need $50k of Callaway
engine, suspension, and brake mods to have some of what 928s come with. 911s
can be made very fast and somewhat civilized, but will never provide the
928's combination of tremendous capability and ease of operation. The
Ferrari 456 GT, a very close relative of the 928 in specifications and
performance, costs $250k+.

However, the 928 is a complex car, with expensive parts, and is expected to
perform at a very high level. This requires the continuing expenditure of
non-trivial quantities of loot, and it's a shame to get into a 928 and not
be able to put and keep it in A-1 shape.

Thanks for asking.

Regards,

LL
