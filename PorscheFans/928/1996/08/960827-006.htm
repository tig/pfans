        Hi all,
                190 mA when everything is supposedly off sounds like a single 
bulb is staying on somewhere.  What I would do is check the following, while 
having a friend or S.O check the Amps on the meter.     
        1 Get in the car (preferably in a dark garage) and shut the door, and 
open the glovebox door.  The amp reading should increase.  if it doesn't you 
have found your problem.
        2 Basically keep doing this with all the "service systems" that still 
operate with the ignition off. If you don't find it that way, then instead of 
opening things, start removing fuses one by one until the current drops; at 
least then you've found the offending circuit...
        
        The electrical "nightmares" with 928's almost stopped me from buying 
another one, I had an '83 before which had some scary faults...  The new one 
appears to be functioning correctly though, although alarm systems only seem to 
work understandably when you've installed them yourself...

Cheers,  Jan

Matt,
   Hmmm...I have been tracing every current draw I can find in the car, 
but with all the MAJOR changes done by ULTRASMITH (the car gadgeteer and 
butcher) I have only managed to get current draw including 2 alarm 
systems down t .19 AMPS Obviously this is not acceptable. Unless I am 
reading the meter wrong.(I'm Not ;-)) 
     
Guess it's back to the wiring harness to trace more draw :-( This is the 
WORST part of this car. I like the "extras", but hate the way they are 
spliced into the harness.
