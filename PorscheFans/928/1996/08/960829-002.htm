I'm strongly considering buying a 1985 or newer 928S if I can find the
right one, but
in general I know very little about the car in terms of maintenance and
what to look for in buying one. If I were to purchase one with 95K to
120K miles on it, could someone tell me what type of maintenance history
it should have (belt changes, sensors, etc...).

Also, what can I expect in terms of maintenance cost such as the cost of
        brake change:
        struts/shocks:
        tires:
        tune-ups:
        anything else that I have forgotten:

also, how would the car be on a trip covering 600 miles?.is it strictly
a curve eater or does it have some interstate comfort as well?

and finally, has anyone out there had both a 911 and a 928? I have
always wanted both but I really like the 928 better. 

I'd welcome any comments pro or con on the 928.

please send e-mail to 

rbs@iar.net

regards,
Brent
