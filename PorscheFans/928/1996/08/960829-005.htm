Timing belt/water pump deal.  The timing belt change if done by a mechanic is
around $500-900.  With a water pump, probably close to $1000.  The 32 V V8 
is an interference engine, so it's crucial the belt is OK and tensioned 
properly.

pads - really depends on type used.  Range from $30-$100+ per set.  I got
the $30 ones on the back (Repco) and the stock pads on the front ($80).

S4 Rotors (Porsche) rears each: $90
S4 Rotors (Porsche) fronts each: $120?  Haven't replaced yet - don't really 
know but they'll be more.

Rebuild kits are about $20 per piston, there are 4 pistons per caliper, so 
around $80 per caliper (potentially, but you probably won't need all 4).

If you do everything yourself, you could run upwards of $350-400 for an S4,
but that's if you need caliper rebuilds etc.  New calipers are in the $100s
of dollars.  If you have someone do it, with labor rates what they are etc,
it could easily run $400-?.  The upside is they are probably the best brakes
around, certainly when they came out they were.  ABS is on the 86 and newer 
cars.

>         struts/shocks:

As I remember, they were around $120-150 each for my S4 when I looked into it.

>         tires:

The Z rated tires (recommended) range from $120/tire for D40 M2s to $280/tire 
for latest Pirellis.  On the S4 and later, the sizes are larger in the rear - 
245-45 R16 or 275-35 R17?.  The rears are thus more expensive than fronts.
Expect <20K miles depending on driving habits.  They are unidirectional
and different size so cannot be rotated on the S4 and later.  I think I paid
around $700 for all 4 with balancing and installation etc last October, which
wasn't bad considering.  But I'll need new tires next summer ....

Rims by the way are very expensive, but they are available second hand
from Robert Wood and others although I've not dealt with them.

>         tune-ups:

"tune up kits" including air, air pump, oil, fuel filters and spark plugs
are about $80.  Dual caps/rotors on S4 and later run about $130.  Wires
(if you ever need them) are about $280.  O2 sensors are around $120-$140 
for my car.
 
Radiators are expensive (like $1000+).  New water pumps are expensive ($300
I think?). Rebuilts can be had for $110-$140.

Clutches if you happen to find a manual 32 V 928, are expensive but I've 
heard people replace them before their time alot.  The labor cost involved
is the main factor ($700+).

Racks are somewhat expensive (~$400 for a rebuilt).

Engines and transaxles are many $1000s.  I think a rebuilt 32 V 928 motor 
goes for something like $5000-7000.  Don't know about transmissions, but
I've seen ads for boneyard transmissions with prices ranging from $1500-3000.

Torque tube (rebuilts) are around $900? from 928 International.

But you shouldn't need any of those (ie don't buy one with those problems 
unless at a significant discount).

It's much better on the open road in my opinion.  It's not a nifty little
autocrosser like a 944 or 911.  It IS extremely stable at high speed and
made for it.  Comfortable on long trips for two or fewer ;).

I'd say the expense and frequent maintenance/tinkering is the biggest 
downside.  But if you consider total cost of ownership of 928 versus a 
comparable American car like a Corvette, it's in the ballpark.  OK maybe 
not the front row, but .... ;)

You can make use of mailorder also and save alot.

The other thing you can do to save alot is get a good one that won't
require major parts replacements, either because it is in good shape or
has had stuff done already.  The maintenance records are worth having.


Hope this helps with your decision!
