Paul,

I just got back from vacation and didn't see that you got a response to   
your questions.

Has anyone either converted to R-134A or to the R-12 substitutes
such as Pennzoil's FR-12?

Do either R-134A or a R-12 replacement cool as well as R-12?

R-134A is not as efficient as R-12.  I've heard reports of about a 10%   
loss in cooling.  The FR-12 product is 59% R-134A, 39% HCFC124, and 2%   
butane.  Theoretically, this combination is supposed to be more efficent,   
than Freon, but you are putting it in a system designed for Freon (R-12),   
so it won't be optimal.  The manufacturer claims that 80% of time it will   
provide cooling equal to Freon per ASE standards (plus or minus 5   
degrees).  I think that R406A will end up being a better choice, as it is   
supposed to be 11-14 % more efficient in R-12 systems, uses mineral based   
lubricant, runs at the same operating pressures so you don't have to mess   
with readjusting the TXV.

I believe most 911s  have thermal expansion valves in the a/c systems, as   
opposed to control cycle pressure switch systems.  Since the molecular   
structure of FR-12 is different than Freon, a proper charge results in   
less pressure in the system, so you have to increase the superheat spring   
tension of the expansion valve by turning the screw clockwise, otherwise   
the system won't cycle properly, and won't cool as well as it could.

I've read the Porsche tech bulletin on the R-134A conversion
(they require evacuating the R-12, then filling with R-12 without
oil, then draining this R-12 to flush the R-12 oil out of the
system--yikes); does Porsche have anything to say about any of
the R-12 substitutes?

I don't know what Porsche recommends.

After the system is evacuated properly, there should exist no more than   
about a tablespoon of mineral oil based lubricant, which can be left in   
the system.  About 2 oz. of POE lubricant is then added.  In the past,   
some shops routinely added a couple of ounces of oil every time they   
recharged a Freon system, to compensate for leakage. Not necessarily a   
good idea.  If this is the case with your car, there may be additional   
oil in the rec/dryer.

Does the FR-12 requires a new receiver-dryer as does the R-134A
conversion?

No.

Would a combined receiver/dryer and accumulator, such as the
Pro-cooler mentioned a week or so ago work better than stock with
either of these refrigerants?

Other than making the system less sensitive to loss (increasing the   
coolant volume) I don't understand how this could help.  The displacement   
of the compressor is still probably a limiting factor. Someone mentioned   
adding condensor capacity a few weeks ago.  This is probably the best way   
to gain cooling, albeit the most drastic modification you might make.

On older systems without barrier hoses, they claim FR-12 will lose 2psi   
or less per year, which is hard too believe. On new cars with barrier   
hoses, loss should be 0.1 psi per year.

The a/c on my '73 911T targa has been down (compressor out of the car)   
since I bought it almost 3 years ago, and I've been struggling with the   
decision of how exactly to resurrect it, particularly since R-12 is about   
$600 for 30lbs now.  This is the same product that sold for $30 not that   
long ago....

Since my a/c is not factory, I have the usual condensor in the engine lid   
grill, and a smaller condensor with fan in the left rear wheel well.  I   
don't have the factory condensor under the front, with the accompanying   
cut out in the trunk, so my overall condensor area is probably too small.   
 Since I really dislike hot weather (why I live in the Sacramento Valley   
is another story) I want my a/c COLD.  I'll probably try and add another   
condensor, replace all existing hoses with barrier hose, switch to a   
higher capacity rotary compressor and use R-406A.  R406A has been   
approved, and the mandatory waiting period for final publication will be   
over in September.  You have to change your charge fittings, but that's   
probably $10 in parts.

Sorry this was so long.

Bob Brewer
