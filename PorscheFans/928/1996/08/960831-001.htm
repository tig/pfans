Hi older 928 owners,

I just had an experience that scared the hell out of me!  I was backing out
of a parking space when my left lower ball joint popped out of its socket.
I had just finished making a normal 70 mph+ trip up the I-5 freeway from
Vancouver, WA to Tacoma, WA.  This car has 100K miles and both lower ball
joints are shot.  I suggest that all purchasers of older 928's take a very
close look at those parts.  If they're aluminum I'd suggest they be replaced
with the retrofit ones made out of steel.  Oh yes, I'd just recently had the
wheels aligned and the alignment guys failed to notice this problem.

Good driving,
Bob East
78 928 (with a broken limb)
