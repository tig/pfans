Hi 928 guys, I just got back from San Diego- thanks for the all of the
tourist tips.  I ended up staying right on the water at the Holliday Inn,
right across the street from the Star of India (great location).

PORSCHE/CAR content: I visited several exotic car dealers in La Jolla- saw
lots of incredible Ferraris and a couple of perfect speedsters.  One of the
places was only open by appointment, so there was no one around.  What was
interesting was that there was an open lot next to the main showroom with
a few cars sitting out- a Ford GT-40 ($1.7 Million asking price) a Ferrari
prototype Dino race car (also $1.7M) a Aston Martin DB4 racecar, etc..
Nice cars, right?  Yeah, but what really surprised me was that most of them
had the keys in the ignition or on the seat!  Can you believe that?!
I guess by the time you got one warmed up enough to steal off the lot, the
security guy would have a gun to your head, but still...

Alright, TRUE PORSCHE CONTENT: I went to one of the Indian Reservation
Casinos and managed to walk out with $150 in profits.  I decided that
this was a sign that I should rent that 930 slantnose cabriolet I saw
at the rental car place down the street.  So, I went down there and
an hour later I was on the road with the monster.  Actually, I was
amazed at how slow the car was.  Up to 4K RPM the car was WEAK.  But
after that the car completely changes attitude.  I couldn't play at
those RPM's much though because half the time I was giving rides to
family members who tended to be side-seat drivers and seemed to doubt
my ability to handle the car when the turbo kicked in...  But, part of
the deal was that I only had to pay for half of it if I drove Mom and
my brothers/sisters around some of the time...  Anyway, I couldn't
believe all of the stares I got- it was kinda unnerving- don't know if
I would want to own such a flashy car...  Still like my black 928 better
all around.

Anyways, I'm in the middle of a UNIX class and should pay attention now,
I suppose...

Talk to you guys later,

Sean '80 928
