We have this dilemma...

We want safe cars on the road.

We want people not to be driving 2-ton cars with tiny narrow wheels and no
ground clearance. Or silly little jacked-up pickup trucks with 4-foot
diameter tires. And we don't want people defeating emissions equipment and
spewing 20 times the hydrocarbons into the air we breathe.

But making the government responsible is like using a hedge trimmer for
brain surgery.

I'm glad the Germans have TUV and the Japanese the JIL. But I'm also happy
we have SEMA, a voluntary industry association instead of a government
testing bureaucracy.

And living in L.A., I accept 'smog certification' as a necessary evil.

The Southern California Air Management District also has a number you can
call to report gross polluting vehicles. This is the best way yet to catch
people who are bypassing the registration process and burning oil by the
gallon.

Since any Porsche in a normal state of tune will pass emissions testing,
this shouldn't be a problem for us... still it would be great if everybody
just complied because it was the right thing to do. (in our dreams)
