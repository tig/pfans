I just checked my copy of Performance Products catalog and it has the
asterisk next to years 78-86 for cars equipped with aluminum ball joints.
You have to get new ecentrics and some spacer piece when you make the
change.  BTW, the upper ball joints are part of the upper control arm and
that little piece is about $449 per side. UGH!!!  However, after that little
incident, my faith in the existing ball joints has been totally shattered.
(Can you say paranoia? (said using a Mr. Rogers accent.))  If that ball joint
had separated on the freeway the results would have been about as ugly as
anyone could possibly imagine!!!!  Oh well, it's only money.  

Quote of the day, "A Porsche owner and his money are soon parted!"

Good driving,
