You are correct, there is a grained plastic dash under the leather, but not padded as the later 
vinyl padded dashes were (at least in the '85 I looked at).  I considered that alternative when I 
worked on mine.  BUT, to remove all the leather and old glue for a good appearance, you will 
still need to remove the dash.  The problem is that on the edge nearest the windshield, the 
leather wraps around under the dash and is glued to the bottom.  If not all removed, there will 
be a real ygly appearance problem when looking into the car from the outside - believe me, it 
will bug you bigtime every time you clean the bugs off that windshield.  I suppose you could get 
it loose enough to peal all the leather off, but to get access to the bolts, you still will have 
to remove everything -- might just as well do it right.

In addition, the dash will no longer match the glove box cover, center console trim etc.
I think the best result is to either cover or recover it.  Furthermore, if you are going to 
replace a cracked instr cluster cover, you are part way there.  The cluster cover has to be 
removed to get the dash out.
