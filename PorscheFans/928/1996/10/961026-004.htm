Hey-
  I got my '87 928 S4 today, and it is fantastic!  The body needs a few
things, but the engine is the most solid piece of work I've ever seen.  I
am most impressed, however, with the handling.  I took it out on a nice,
winding road (one that my BMW 633 complained about at speed), and even at
70 MPH, the car begged for more...
  I LOVE THIS CAR ALREADY!

  By the way, if anyone has any good restoration tips, I'd love to hear
'em.  I also need to know where the fuse box/ relay panel is- the flasher
relay is out, and I don't have a manual.

Yours in motorsport,

John Williams
