John asked:

>> I also need to know where the fuse box/ relay panel is- the flasher
relay is out, and I don't have a manual. <<

Panel is in right (passenger) footwell.  Unsnap carpet at right front side of footwell, pull two 
rubber belt tips back through the metal loops at top of carpet in footwell, pull back carpet to 
expose plywood floorboard.  It hinges at top, can be lifted up to expose relay panel.  Check 
owners manual to find correct fuse.

BTW, although the 9 vol shop manual is expensive at $275-300, if you plan to do any of your own 
work, it is a necessity.  The 9 vol set covers all 928s from 1977-1995.  Until I got mine, I made 
a real pest of myself down at the local dealer.  The 928 expert was extremely supportive of me 
doing my own work and helpful with tips and guided looks into the manuals, but the service 
manager doesn't like me much.
