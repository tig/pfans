No, not JUST like; I can lift in a turn and not spin. I can also accelerate
NOW, rather than shifting down or waiting for the engine to come on the cam
or the turbo to spool up.

My post was a reply to a man who just bought a 928 S4 and was exulting
about it on the 928 list, to which I also sent my post. Unlike Custer, I
had no plans to invade (or even send my post to) a potentially hostile
group. You were nice enough to do that for me.

Custer was overwhelmed by huge numbers of people he'd challenged; this
sounds more like the fate of Ernst Fuhrmann and front-engined P-fans
generally, with the 911 believers and Porsche AG playing the part of the
Native Americans.

Cheers right back,

Leonard Laub
