Thanks, UB, but that's not a paraphrase. It is good advice, but it does not
deal with the matter of margin that I raised to you. No matter how skilled
you are, if your vehicle constrains your options, you're more likely to
wind up in a situation out of which you can't get.

Oh, my; another objective criterion for evaluating cars. Corvettes are
raced a lot, often finishing ahead of anything Stuttgartian, but I don't
think either of us wants one.

Why? It sounds as though you'd be deprived of the "feature" you lustfully
describe, and a nice Lincoln Mark VII or BMW 850 would give you even nicer
cruising than any 928.

Gee, I thought you just got through informing me of the reality of TTO!

Checker, check thyself.

Gak! Do you want to tell us more about this, including the nature of the
vehicle?

>TTO is *much* more actual *fun,* in my humble opinion...

There's that "feature" again.

Kumquattily yours,
