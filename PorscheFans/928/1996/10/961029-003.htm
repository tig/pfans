Aaaaahhh...  If Yer Kindly ol' Unka Bart may take the liberty of paraphrasing
the learned Leonard, "There's this little matter of actually needing to know how
to drive, and not actually doing something *stupid*..."

Quite right.  There's no question that the 911 requires a higher degree of 
mastery, of driving *skill,* than most other high performance cars in the world,
to be driven *exuberantly*.  

And one suspects we are in agreement that no one should drive outside the 
"normal" envelope who is not properly equiped with training and skill, 
regardless of the vehicle one is driving.  We are definitely in agreement with 
your observation that the 928 is much more forgiving and tolerant of fools that 
the 911.  

One could even say that "trailing throttle oversteer" is, in this respect, the 
"Sex, drugs and Rock 'N Roll" of the Automotive milleau.  I don't recommend it 
for everyone, but it sure as hell works for me...

Trailing throttle oversteer, it's not a bug, it's a *feature!*

No need to apologize, Leonard.  In fact, since you were thinking of high speed 
in turns, you might want to peruse the results of the worlds great sports car 
(and GT) races, for, say, the last 30 years.  911s and 928s are both conspicuous
in this venue.  One of them, by their (regular) *presence*...

Quite.  I happen to be a happy member of the 928 list.  I would *love* to have a
928S4, and greatly admire the beasties.  But you, Leonard, old kumquat, posted a
very ludicrous, and may I (charitably) say, uninformed put-down of the 911.

Being a notoriously comapssionate old soul, Yer Kindly ol' Unka Bart immediately
whipped out his check-book and wrote you a generous *reality-check*...

I'll have to try that sometimes, it sounds like fun.  Alas, I confess I haven't 
tried it yet.  I have, on the other hand, been in a *front* engined, V8 that 
left the road at an estimated speed in excess of 145 mph. (Got quite good 
reviews for "hang-time," BTW...). TTO is *much* more actual *fun,* in my humble 
opinion...

Yer Kindly ol' Unka Bart (who agrees, btw, with both Pat Moyle and Dave Darling)
