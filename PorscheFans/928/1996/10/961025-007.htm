I had experienced some fairly severe brake fade on my '84 at the last
couple of track events. Called Kim Crumb, the PCA 928 guru, for advice.
He said get Performance Friction or Hawk brake pads, put in a higher
temperature fluid like ATE Blue, and change the proportioning valve
from the current 33 bar one to a 55 bar job, apparently a 930 part.
I did the first two, went to a driver ed at New Hampshire Int'l
Speedway today, and it was WONDERFUL. All the brakes i could ever
want. Of course now the tires are the limiting factor, and I will
have to think about getting myself a Christmas present of a set of
R1's, but it was so nice to improve the car's capability with such
an obvious, and not too expensive, change that I had to pass it
along.
