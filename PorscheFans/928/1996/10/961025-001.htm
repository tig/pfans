I have been informed that Porsche only made one vinyl dash for the 928.
That means under the leather covering, there is a vinyl dash, complete with
leather grain finish, suitable for exposure. I have also been told that
this dash is often brown, no matter what interior color you may have, so it
may need vinyl dye.

As the leather continues ot shrink back from my defroster vents and the
concave area on the passenger side, I am temped to find out for myself.

Anyone had the guts to try this yet?
