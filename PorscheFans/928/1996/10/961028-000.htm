I got to drive the desired, at least by me, 928S4, '89, 5 speed all by
my self. First impression was the rigidness. "Hewn from solid" Jonathan
Palmer called it and he was right. 

Size
I immediately got used to size of it, "it shrinks around you" somebody
said in this list and he was right. My currently most driven car is a
Honda CRX! 

Shift
The shift pattern is different but gave no problem. First to second
ended in fourth the first time, being afraid to hit reverse! The engine
didn't complain, you still keep up with other trafic. Acceleration was
without drama from any rpm at in any gear. Glancing at the speedometer
confirmed I each time was doing twice the speed it felt. The sensation
of speed in a small jumpy car like the CRX is greater but it then apears
you are actually not going as quick as it feels. Confidence grew
quickly. The travel to second and fourth gear seemed much longer than to
the others, same as in my CRX. Just the pattern is upside down.

Clutch
It was very smooth and had quite a long travel. No trembling or clatter,
and handled the power effortless. The CRX really snaps on and off,
hardly any travel which adds to the very direct feel of the car.

Accelerator
The heavy feeling loud pedal was very progressive, the first part of
travel nothing happens but then it starts to yawn, grin and realy roar
at 5500 rpm. The revcounter can be made to jump up as quick as in the
CRX. Great, might be difficult to stick to your licence though.

Shocks
It had factory sport shocks. Felt like a rock on the road. Not harsh
though, but of course my reference is the even stiffer CRX suspension.
Despite that the light CRX is less stable. The 928 could be trown like
the CRX, it just didn't feel soo jumpy.

Brakes
Again you don't notice how good they are before you get in another car.
They effortlessly stop under any circumstance without drama. It seems so
naturally that after getting in my CRX I really though: gee someone
removed my brakes pads while I was playing with the 928.

Trip computer
I didn't play with that during my first drive. But after the trip it
read in the "average mode"  20.5 liter per 100 km  (11.5 mpUSg if I take
1 US gallon = 3.785 liter). Does anybody know how the averaging is done:
over the last trip, last x miles or ...? I was hoping for 16.5 mpUSg
(19.5 mpImpg). Is this realistic driving half town half freeway?

Overall impression
Addictive
