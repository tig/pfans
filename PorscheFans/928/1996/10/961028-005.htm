Congratulations!

>at 70 MPH, the car begged for more...

....and will continue to do so as the speed rises. Unlike a 911, your car
will not suddenly punish you when you're having such fun. However, make
sure your tires are healthy and properly inflated.

>  I LOVE THIS CAR ALREADY!

It gets better!

>I also need to know where the fuse box/ relay panel is

Remove the mat and carpet from the passenger footwell and lower the wooden
panel to find a whole lot of fuses and relays.

>I don't have a manual.

The owner's manual, which will help you navigate this electrical maze, can
be purchased from Automotion, Performance, and other mail order parts
houses, who can also sell you the factory spec book (cheap and full of
goodies) and the shop manual (not cheap, but valuable, including a complete
map of the wiring).
