Rich asked:

>> What I'm wondering is how much of a headache can these cars be? Am I better off spending alot 
more for a slightly newer one (with a known history), or more still for an S4? <<

A 928 for less than $5,000 can be a good deal only if it is in good condition. Porsche parts are 
expensive.  Remember that just recently, new 928s sold for more than $80,000.  Accordingly, new 
parts are expensive.  In addition, the 928 is a complicated car which can translate into high 
repair bills if you have to pay someone else to do a lot of work.

However, the 16 valve motors are a lot simpler, less expensive to fix and are not subject to the 
dreaded "ruined valve syndrom" if the timing belt breaks.  I would NEVER consider an undocumented 
S4 unless the price was $6,000 to 8,000 below market.

Having said that, 928s are wonderful cars and a lot of fun to drive if properly maintained.  
Periodic maintenance can be more expensive than American or Japanese cars simply because a lot of 
things need to be inspected, lubed etc. and this takes time.  Well maintanied 928s easily last in 
excess of 200,000 miles without any engine work.  Clutch may need replacing at 150,000.  I would 
expect the automatic trans may be expensive to fix.  Rebuilt 5-spds are available for under 
$2,000.  First gear synchros are a weak point.  Timing belt should be replaced every 60,000 
miles.  If I owned a 32v car, I'd replace it every 45,000 just to be safe.  Water pumps are a 
weak point on early cars.  Sometimes they go out at 60-70,000 miles.  But, used and reconditioned 
parts are readily available since the parts value of many 928s is much greater than the market 
value as a running car.  

Leather seats and interiors don't hold up if exposed to sun.  The dash and instrument cluster 
cover are almost always cracked and/or shrunken.  The leather-covered parts are VERY expensive.  
A proper repaint job is also very expensive.  So if the interior or paint is bad, either live 
with it or find a better car.  

You might want to obtain and read Bruce Anderson's articles in past issues of Excellence on 
buying a Porsche.  He wrote a series of articles on buying a $6,000 $12,000 and $18,000 Porsche.  
There is good info on all Porsches in those articles.
