| Hello fellow members! I am just recently signing up and am looking at 
| a 928, 1983 model. It is pretty basic ie. not an S4, auto. power seats,
| windows, & locks. Great shape (fresh paint $3500, white with blue
| pearl=very professional job) & black int. Also it has 116,+++ miles, 
| and a sunroof. I was told it had a new water pump, and recently was
| tuned(ignition components). Starts a little rough(maybe they all do?)
| idles fine, but I did not get to take it out on the road. What should 
| I look for? What type of questions should be asked?  I am looking for
| check this for leaks, make DAMN sure that was replaced at xx,xxx 
| miles, etc. Also the asking price is $15k. I beleive it is worth about $10k,
| but with the paint job..... Any way thanks a lot==chad

Welcome Chad,
I have an '83 with about the same mileage as the one you're looking at and can 
relate some of my experiences with it to you.  I hear the water pump is a 
problem, however, I still have the original pump on my car.  My car starts 
fine.  No roughnes on start up or any other time, so that would concern me.  
Roughness on startup could be simple stuff like cap, rotor, plugs, and wires.  
Replacement spark plug wires are relatively expensive.  The timing belt should 
have been changed a couple of times in 116k.  Check the brake rotors, they can 
be kinda expensive.  The exhaust system's mufflers are an absurd price too. 
Maintenance should have been done to the car during the 116k, but I can't 
think of anything that damn sure needs to be replaced.  If you look at the car 
and have other questions, please ask!
