Stock rotors, stock lines. Stainless lines have a bad reputation for
abrupt failure, as do drilled rotors (ones that were cast with holes
in them are OK). 

Speaking of brake failure, there was a bad incident at my driver ed
session yesterday when an experienced driver had "no brakes" and
drove his 993 into a jersey barrier wall, protected by two layers
of tires, at about 40 mph. This was at the end of a braking zone
that he would have entered at over 100, so he obviously had some
brakes, but not enough. He was just fine, the harness and the air
bag did their job, but the car is toast. He managed about 30 degrees
of a 120 degree, 25 mph turn. Knocked over the jersey barrier. Which
goes to show that even the best brakes can fail - I have no idea why
his did - and that it's worth thinking about what you will do if it
happens. I think if he had gone straight he would have been better
off; there is a little runoff space at that point on the track, not
much, but better than trying a turn you can't possibly make. No
chance to figure that out when it happens, but if you've already
thought about it you might do the right thing.
