That's the way it should feel.

Ditto.

>The shift pattern is different but gave no problem.

Apart from autocross, you should expect to use first to get underway and
then stick to the 2-5 H at which point the pattern will make sense. This is
different from most cars, but so is the 928.

Don't try to shift quickly. A brief pause in neutral and steady engagement
of the next gear (up or down) works much better.

>but then it starts to yawn, grin and realy roar at 5500 rpm.

The first plateau for torque should be about 3000-3500 rpm. From there, it
should be fairly steady.

>The revcounter can be made to jump up as quick as in the CRX.

Yes, the flywheel is not too heavy and there's plenty of torque.

>Great, might be difficult to stick to your licence though.

This is the biggest challenge of S4 ownership.

>It had factory sport shocks. Felt like a rock on the road.

This is the only real caution point I see in your report. Most people I've
spoken with about the 928 sport shocks find them too harsh in daily use. If
you haven't already, try driving the car at speed on rough or block-paved
roads and see how you feel. Since the car otherwise sounds very good, you
may put up with this or expect sometime in the future to replace the shocks
(which you'll eventually need to do anyway)

>Again you don't notice how good they [the brakes] are before you get in
another car.

A very clever way of describing this effect.

>I was hoping for 16.5 mpUSg (19.5 mpImpg). Is this realistic driving half
town >half freeway?

Probably not, unless you drive very mildly. I'm impressed if I see 14-15
mpg, and usually see 12, though my driving is mostly aggressive.

>Overall impression
>Addictive

Yes!!
