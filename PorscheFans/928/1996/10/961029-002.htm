I did drive it over badly paved roads and it didn't feel too harsh. This
of course is a very subjective matter and may also depend very much on
the condition of one's back. On the other hand, I might be positively
biased by the overall impression and already be in the stadium of
forgiving little nuisances.

Seatrails
I forgot to mention the adjustability of the rails. There were indeed
two holes, one inch apart, in the lower rail at each of the four seat
corners. It looked like an easy DIY job to mount the whole seat an inch
back, just four easy reachable bolts.
