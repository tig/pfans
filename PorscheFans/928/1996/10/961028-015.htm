Well, there's this little matter of lifting in a tight or fast turn,
something which, in a 928, produces a reduction of speed generally without
abrupt change of direction. In a 911, one uses the technological euphemism
"trailing throttle oversteer" to describe a characteristic which requires
remembering never to lift while the lateral G forces are high, which in
turn (no pun intended) requires some cooperation from the road gods in not
further reducing the radius or putting any other surprises in front of you.

Looking at my post, I see how you could draw the inference that speed qua
speed is a problem in a 911. Porsche's been pretty good at equipping all
its street cars with enough downforce encouragers so that straight line
speed is not a problem in any model. I was thinking only of high speed in
turns, as above, and apologize for not making this clearer.

>Hmmmmm...?

However, it should be noted that my post was directed only to the 928 list.
Both Thom Kuby and you have picked this up on behalf of 911 proponents, at
least a few of whom could share with you their "off the road tail first"
experiences.

Rutabegish regards,
