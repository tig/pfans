Scutter asks:

>> I alway end up with a puddle on the floor of the
left rear passenger side behind the drivers seat after it rains. <<

Do you have a sunroof?  All good sunroof designs have drain tubes. Often they get clogged or 
otherwise stopped up.  Do the doors fit up tightly? The strikers are adjustable.  Most rubber 
problems can be diagnosed by careful visual inspection.  It often helps to look at another car 
like yours.
 
>> ..he broke the thing with the triangle warning light.  I can put it back in
place but I don't know where to plug it in.  Do I have to replace the center
dash? <<

You can get good access to the plugs that go into the back of the "center indicator" by removing 
the carpetted side panels on the center console.  There is one screw at the bottom center of each 
panel.  At the footwell end, you may have to remove the package trays to free up that end, and on 
the drivers' side you may have to remove or loosen the screw at the front edge of the rubber 
shield to the right of the accellerator pedal.  There is just a push-on panel snap holding the 
end nearest the seat.  Gently pry it up with the Porsche all-purpose trim removal tool (2"" 
flexible putty knife).
 
>>  The right side power window isn't working.  Should I check the switch
first? <<

Yes.  Do this while you have the right carpetted panel removed from the console.  If the switch 
makes a clicking noise, it probably is ok.  Listen to the other door switch.  The switch plug is 
up near the front of the the console in the right footwell.  With the panel off, you will see two 
long (around 3') plastic cable tubes that run along the right side of the console towards the 
firewall.  These each have four wires and terminate in a colored plug.  One is the window, 
another is wiper or sunroof, I forget which one.  The plugs are red, green, yellow (can't 
remember which).  Just make sure they are plugged in.  When a previous owner messed with the 
radio, he probably unplugged one of these cables.  If not, the switch can be pryed up out of the 
console to expose the terminals (but that might destrony the switch).  Check for power.  New 
switches are available for around $30-35 from the dealer and come with new cable and plug.  I 
replaced all four of mine because the silk-screened symbols had worn off.  They look very nice.

>> 4.  Is it true that If anything happens to the fuel distributor i will have to replace it with  
a new one because rebuilds are not available?  <<

Performance Products shows a rebuilt for $829.  PN is 928-110-906-00 for new.  Call PCNA in Reno 
and ask.  Also, check with the other usual suspects such as Vertex, Tweeks etc.  Also consider 
used.  Is yours bad?

>> 5.  Was 7x16 Phone Dial rims available as a option in 79?  <<

I don't know.  But, I'd look around for the 16" Fuchs "Flat Dish" style wheels.  They are forged 
rather than cast and are bulletproof.  They were an option (at least in 1982).
