Last week while I was on vacation, I checked out a '84 928S (90K 
miles) that was sitting on a used car lot. The body is in good shape, 
I looked carefully for signs of a collision, nothing evident anyway. 
The interior was basically good, except for a nonoperational driver's 
power seat and power window. It accelerated well, and seemed to handle
tightly. They are (were, if they've sold it) looking for about 5K, but 
I think that they would take less. What I'm wondering is how much of a 
headache can these cars be? Am I better off spending alot more for a 
slightly newer one (with a known history), or more still for an S4? 
Also has anyone every tried one in winter with studded snows. (I'm in 
Vermont and have studded Nokia Hakapolita on all four wheels of my 
Saab 9000 turbo). Thanks for any input!
