Exsqueeze me, Leonard, old rutabega, but just exactly *how* is it that a *911*
will suddenly punish one, when one is having such fun, as it were...?

Not that Yer Kindly ol' Unka Bart would ever doubt you in the slightest, but 
he seems to recall many a mile well into tripple digits in his Carrera, and 
doesn't recall *any* unpleasant surprises in the process...

Hmmmmm...?
