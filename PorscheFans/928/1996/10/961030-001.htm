Mark Fling asks:

>> How good are the manuals for somebody like me looking at buying a 928, particularly a 91 or 
later S4?  I figure they'd be an excellent way to bone up on 928s, and after a purchase, helpful 
in daily maintenance. <<
 
The shop manual set is a real necessity for someone who is doing his own non-routine mechanical 
repair, rebuild or replacement work.  For routine maintenance I suggest the Owners' Manual which 
has schedules for suggested periodic maintenance and good photos of what Porsche considers owner 
maintainable items such as maintaining fluid levels, fuses & relay location, and general 
capacities etc.  Unfortunately, there is not a middle ground.

For the potential buyer:
The manuals do describe the different model features.  i.e. what engine and transmission code 
goes with what year.  This could be helpful in verifying that a  proffered car is in fact what it 
is claimed to be.  However, the dealer service dept can usually tell you a lot about a car if you 
give them the VIN (left windshield post) and any option codes found on the production sticker 
(under rear hatch mat to the right of spare tire well).  This would also be a good oportunity to 
get the prospect car thoroughly checked, providing you have ready access to a Porsche dealer who 
is interested in you.  If none is, you need to locate a 928 knowledgeable independent mechanic 
and you might as well start searching now.    Also get the 928 stuff from lib 19 in the CARS 
section on Compuserve (GO CARS) browse for the keyword 928.  There is a brief description of 928 
by year and the text of Bruce Anderson's articles for Excellence about buying Porsche cars.

PCA also publishes technical ref booklets describing models and equipment by year (I haven't 
studied these, yet).

After purchase:
The newly released Parts & Technical Reference Manual for 924/944/928 (PNA 000147A) is a useful 
tool and is only $9.95.  Unfortunately it only covers 1977-1988 models. I just got mine today.  
BTW, I went to the same dealer I gave my hard earned $300 to for the full manual set.  The parts 
manager didn't charge me for the parts manual!  (Your dealer may vary.)  I would also purchase 
the back issues of Excellence mag that have 924/944/928 maintenance articles by Jim Pascha.  Jim 
(JAPasha@aol.com) also is found here on the PorscheFans-944 list.  I have the issues with his 
articles on periodic maintenance, brake systems, and something else I can't remember.  Also, you 
should join PCA.  There is a resident 928 wizzard, Kim Crumb who fields tech questions.  Bruce 
Anderson, Chairman of PCA Technical advise (BrucePor@aol.com) is also found here on the 
PorscheFans-911 list.  If you decide to do more serious repair work, the manual set is almost 
required.  It can be somewhat hard to follow, hard to find what you need to know, but there is 
info in there not available elsewhere.  Personally, I use everything at my disposal.  I approach 
each project, decide who is going to do it, sometimes pay for it, sometimes do it myself.  
Anything I decide to take on myself, I read the manual, ask the list, ask over at CARS, ask the 
dealer mechanic, check parts costs from dealer and several other sources, used and new, ask a 
couple of independent mechanics etc.
