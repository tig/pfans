Just as an introduction to this list ....

My name is Chuck Olson.  I own a 87 928s4.  It's (believe it or not) my
first Porsche, but I've been around them for a while as a friend of mine
has tracked his cars for the past several years (944, 924, 944 Turbo S and 
911 S).

I've been a member of PCA and porschephiles myself since last year and
am still one of the "true believers" in the 928 (despite it's recent
demise) as the preeminent "supercar" design and all around one of the
best luxury sports cars in the world.

I'm somewhat familiar with other foreign makes like Honda, Nissan and Toyota
as well as some exposure with 12 cylinder Jag, Maserati and Range Rover 
through assisting work in a friend's garage.  I do most of my own maintanance
on my 928 but rely on a trusted mechanic for major work (just a few things
thus far).

I live in the New England area and work as a computer engineer for a 
small to medium size but growing by leaps and bounds company that sells
network switches to long distance carriers.
