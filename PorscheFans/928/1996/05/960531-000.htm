Hi!  Hey I'm here on the new list.  I wonder what'll happen when tta.com comes back?

Anyways, I'm finishing the install of a new Blaupunkt Tucson in my '84.  I'm just about done.  I have the head unit mounted and everything connected.

As previously mentioned, the wiring is set up to take L and R from the radio and run it to a passive fader knob on the left of the driver's seat.  There, I think it splits the signal to a front L and R pair and a rear L and R pair.

Of course my radio has a 4 channel amp, making the fader obsolete.

I thought I would fish for any info on bypassing this fader.  I have the factory wiring diagrams that show the radio / fader wiring, but if anyone has actually done this, I'd appreciate any advice.  I haven't physically traced the wire routing yet.  It probably won't be hard, but as with the 928, I'll probably spend all weekend debugging the setup, creating my own plan, running wires - doing it right.

I also need to determine where to connect the radio's illumination dimmer wire.  I tried the illumination dimmer connection at the clock (blk-blu), but I don't think it works for some reason.  The clock still dims nicely...

BTW, the Tucson is a nice radio.  4x20W amp built in - sufficient for most people.  It has a lot of logic (features), so I need to study the manual to be familiar with all the buttons.  An interesting frill is a programmable 16 char turn on message.  I have it saying "All systems go".

If you have any comments that'll help me this weekend, please cc me directly, since I get the digest version of the list...
