Hi all,
I recently purchased an '84 928S.  It was my next door neighbor's. It has
58,000 miles on it and it was totally babied.  The car runs great, however, I
have noticed that the oil pressure guage reads 5 for the first 20 to30
minutes of drive time.  It doesn't matter if it's idleing or if its
accelerating.  Is this normal?  My second question concerns the climate
control.  During the summer in Atlanta the Air conditioning was incredible
but now that it is getting colder out the heat does not seem to work.  It
blows as cold at the 85 setting as it did at the 60 setting.  I noticed in
the receipts the previous owner left that a mechanic would change a hose in
between seasons.  I can't find where this hose is?  Any help would be
appreciated!!!

yes it is.

Did you have it replaced recently?  Could just need retensioning, if so,
drive carefully (or have it towed like I did) to the repair shop.

If it's an old belt, definitely have it towed.   Worth the 100 bucks
to save a few thousand.

I wonder if what you experience is actually the throttle hanging open.  I
just worked on a 79 with that problem.  There are several ball-joints in the
accelerator linkage, a cable, and the throttle body itself, all of which can
wear, dry out, or whatever and develop friction.  Despite only 75000 miles,
your car is fourteen years old and will still suffer old age problems.  You
might start by going through the above items for freedom of movement.

Well, now that the warning light is on, and with 71,xxx miles on the
odometer, I will need to change the timing belt...

Does anyone have a procedure written out for this?
Any suggestion of other part that should be changed while this repair is
done (somebody mentionned the guides and the tensionner...)
Anything I should pay particular attention to?

Water pump's always a question but not necessarily required at this
point.  It's right there though so the labor is saved if it goes
before the next belt replacement.

Hello,

This is an unusual request, but I'm looking for picture similar to what
Porsche uses in their ads.  I have to make a configuration guide for
the company I work for and had a great idea for the cover page, but I
need a road that is streaked similar to the Porsche ads.  Would anyone
know (or have) any pictures like this?

I have looked at tons of clip-art and graphics, but haven't found any
as nice as the ads.

Thanks.

Farzaan.

>> Does anyone know the best way to open the hatchback on a 928 when the key
turns but 
the lock does not unlock. I think the linkage between the lock barrel and the
latch 
must have broken. <<

Have you tried pressing down on the hatch whilst turning the key?  I was
advised by a 
locksmith to always do this to keep from having the latch fail and the hatch
fly open.  
The release of pressure may be enough to allow the latch to turn.  BTW, I
have seen 
one other 928 with the lock barrel removed - obviously because of a problem -
so this 
is not an isolated incident.  I haven't tried this, but maybe if you lower
the rear 
seats, crawl back towards the rear, loosen and lower the tool cover, you
might be able 
to at least take a look at the latch.  Since later 928s had electric remote
latch 
release, there may be something there you can push or pull on the release the
hatch 
latch.

>> The speedo works but the odometer does not. Any advice? <<

There is no mechanical cable to speedo, a sender is used, and only electrical

connections exist - at least on my '82.  Must be a problem within the
instrument 
cluster unit.  I'd bet there is a mechanical linkage inside from speedo to
odometer.  
It will have to be repaired.  Removing the cluster is very tedious and time
consuming.  
Locate a speedometer shop who has fixed this problem successfully BEFORE you
start 
dowm the arduous road of instrument cluster removal.  Standard labor time is
around 
3.5 hours.

Subject: Re: Starting Problem

 Phil Tong asked for clarification:
 
>>  What you're saying is the check valve failed so the system had no
"leftover" 
pressure in it for the first fireup right?  <<
 
Well, there is some controversy as to just how long the fuel system does or
should 
stay pressurized after the engine has been shut down.  The pressure should
hold for a 
couple of hours, but surely won't hold overnight.  I believe the check valve
has two 
funtions.  Hold pressure allowing for an easy restart.  Make initial starting
faster 
by aiding the fuel pump in pressurizing the fuel system on initial starts.
 Remember 
that early 928s needed two fuel pumps - one in the gas tank and a helper.  My
guess is 
that a better pump outside the gas tank and one-way check valve was the
improvement.

In any case, anyone who has hard starting should check the usual suspects,
fuel, air, 
and spark.  I'm told that failing (weak) fuel pump or clogged filter often
show up in 
poor running or sudden death.  My car always has run great once started.  Now
it also 
starts great.

Subject: Pronounciations

Subject: German pronounciations
The comments from Peter Albrecht on the above subject are are correct.
First of all, Porsche is a two syllable word, period. That's the founder's
name,
that's how it's pronounced in Germany. As a single syllable word, it doesn't
sound quite right, does it: What do you do with the "e" on the end?

928: again, Peter is correct. "Neunachtundzwanzig" is the everyday
expression. I
have yet to hear someone in Germany refer to their 928 as a "neun zwei acht".

944: Neunvierundvierzig. Again, "neun vier vier" is a no-go.

Within Clubs or within Porsche AG, people usually refer to the models by
their
simple last two numbers, dropping the 9, hence, a Boxster is a
"Sechsundachtziger", a 911 is an "Elfer", a 944 a "Vierundvierziger", the 993
is
a "Dreiundneunziger", etc.

Serge Dubuc

Man, sounds like a nightmare!  If it were my car I'd start with the basics
first -- 
check vacuum at idle for hints, timing, test O2 sensor, cranking compression.
 What lead 
up to this?  Was something done or added recently?  You may be going down a
false 
path.  Maybe Devek can give some leads?

Good luck & keep us posted!

I am going to agree here...  So what's wrong (mechanically) with putting in a
tee and 
flushing out the block like any other V8? 

Also, I did one oil filter R&R and reused the washer with no leaks.  I put on
one of 
those "permanent" plugs with the spigot to make changes faster.  The only
thing is, the 
spigot outlet doesn't point straight down due to the placement of the drain
hole on the 
pan, but points straight out the side!  Will have to fashion some kind of
tube or shield 
so the hot oil doesn't shower my tire.

Now I woulda' never thought of that!  Seems plausible.  I am going to try it
on my car 
for my mom's FA (and she's only 5' 2" but sits on the belt by mistake)

For sure on my US car, the bottom round knob is the odo reset (push to

Now that you mention it, just where was the rear fog light mounted?  I'd like
to put a 
"third" reverse light using one of those new fangled mini halogen jobs.
