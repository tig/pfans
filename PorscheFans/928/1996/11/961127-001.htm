        I just want to thank everyone that replied to my postings regarding
the purchase of a 928.  As of four hours I became the owner of a very clean
car, just ask if anybody has any questions.

157000 miles
In the last 20,000 it has had the following
rebuilt trans
clutch
altermator
water pump
lots of minor electical things fixed, everthing works fine right now.

Other than a cracked dash the interior in perfect.  Tan leather in great
shape, front seats show a little wear but still look nice. The door panels
and carpet look like they could be two years old.  Exterior is great except
for some rock chips on the nose and hood.  NO door dings. The owner was just
what a guy is looking for very into the cars and took good care of it.  I
got all the records, a chilton manual and the 8 volume Porsche manuals, a
car cover, and all the reading material that he had collected on the cars
over the last 6 years.   Best of all NO SUNROOF!!!  Just hope the engine
will do 300K.

Price $7200
