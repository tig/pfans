CLUB RACE AT LE CIRCUIT, QUEBEC

Scott Hughes, national director of BMW CCA club racing, has reached an
agreement to hold a CCA club race at LeCircuit race track, Mt. Tremblant,
Quebec on the weekend of August 16-17, 1997. The CCA club race will be
part of a weekend of racing events at the track which is expected to
include the participation of PCA club racers, Vintage racers, and regional
road racers. This joint weekend is the brain child of the track manager, 
Vince Loughra. Each organization will hold separate events and receive 
approximately 90 minutes of track time per day. There is also the 
possibility that a challenge cup race will be run featuring CCA, PCA, and 
possibly vintage racers running under 13/13 (i.e., no contact) rules if 
time, interest, and regulations allow. Track costs per racer are expected 
to be in the range of $200 US. CCA registration for this event will be 
limited to 40 racers. If you are a CCA club racer, please let me know 
whether you are interested in participating.

DRIVING SCHOOL ON FRIDAY, AUGUST 15

There is also the possibility of holding a driving school on Friday, 
August 15 under regular school (i.e., not racing) rules. This may include 
separate margue run groups, possibly with in-car instructors, and 
classroom sessions. Cost will be approximately $100 US. If you are a CCA 
member, please let me know whether you are interested in participating.

ABOUT LE CIRCUIT

Le Circuit, a former Formula One course, is one of the premier road racing
circuits in the Northeast. The long course is 2.65 miles, includes 14
turns, and has a number of elevation changes. It lies at the foot of Mt.
Tremblant, in the heart of the Laurentian mountains, which is a year-round
vacation destination for Americans and Canadians alike. It is the ideal
location for driving enthusiasts who also wish to provide vacation
activities (e.g., golf, tennis, sailboarding, hiking, haute cusine,
fishing, boating, etc.) for friends and family. Finally, with a rate of
exchange about 1.35, there is excellent value to be had for the US dollar. 

An excellent description of each turn of the track was prepared by Russ 
Castagna of the PCA/Northeast region and can be found at their web site. 
Richard Welty's web site also contains a map of the circuit and 
information about the area. You can also pick up a copy of Mario 
Andretti's Drive to Win from Classic Motorbooks; it has extended footage 
of the track in the second half. Finally, contact me if you want further 
information about the track and the area.

CALLING ALL PCA CLUB RACERS

I would like to hear from racers and club members in the PCA who would be
interested in taking part in the weekend. In particular, I would like to
know whether this date will appear on the PCA calendar and who will
coordinate PCA involvement. Consequently, if you are a PCA member, please
bring this memo to the attention of the organizers of club racing in your
region and/or the national executive. They may wish to contact the 
manager of LeCircuit, Vince Loughra, directly at 819-425-6363 for details of 
the plan.


CALLING ALL VOLUNTEERS

Plans for the race weekend are far from complete. Scott and I can use 
your help if you or your chapter can volunteer. Please let me know 
whether and how you are willing to assist. And please feel free to 
distribute this memo to others you feel would be interested.
