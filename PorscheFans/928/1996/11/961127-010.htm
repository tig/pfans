Hello out there in 928 land.

First I would like to say thanks to David Wolf, John C. White, Leonard
Laub and Thomas Skinner for there responses to my "I'm a Virgin"
e-mail.  Thanks Especially to Leonard for his great advice and
knowledge about 928's.  

When looking at purchasing a 928 I drove a couple of S4's and I noticed
a real difference in acceleration, especially from 50-100mph.  I ended up
getting an S, because of a smashing deal that I got, but I would like to
get that same acceleration that I felt with the S4.  As far as I can find out
from my research, there is a different intake manifold and heads on a S4
motor.  Have any of you ever upgraded a S motor to and S4 motor?  If
so, was it worth?  Is there more economical was to achieve the same
power with the S engine? 

Thanks in advance for the info!!!

Happy Thanksgiving!!
