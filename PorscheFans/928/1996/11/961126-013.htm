Congratulations on your new car - I've had mine for three and a half
years and still get a kick out of it. Have you joined the Porsche
Club of America? They have various activities that you might enjoy
with your new car, like autocrosses, driver education on race tracks,
rallies, coucours, whatever your tastes call for. 

As to holding their value: I dunno, maybe 911's are an aberration for
holding their value so well. After all, yours is a ten-year-old car
now. The current Excellence magazine has an article examining the
changes in 928's over the years, both technical and economic, that
you might find interesting. Of course, even though the car is not
expensive, the parts still are, so that it seems that quite a few
have not been well-maintained.

Tuneups? What's a tuneup? Electronic ignition, electronically-
controlled fuel injection, hydraulic lifters - there's nothing
left to do. Change the oil and filter regularly, the coolant and
brake fluid every couple of years, be sure the plugs are OK...
and be very sure your timing belt is good. If you don't know when
it was changed, that is if it might be 60K miles old, you should
get it changed; if it fails pistons will meet valves with dire
results, and the car won't seem inexpensive any more. I think
you need the $pecial Porsche tool to get the timing belt tension
right; there is a tensioner which compensates for the change in
the length of the belt path as the engine heats up, but you
still need to start with the right tension.

And enjoy this mail list also.
