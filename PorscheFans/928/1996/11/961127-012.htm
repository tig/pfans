I am actively looking for my "perfect" 928. My brother down in Ft. Lauderdale, Fl has
been looking for me and my enthusiasm has rubbed off on him. I have been involved with
Porsches for the last +35yrs (356-911) and do most of my own mech work. My brother has
limited (NO) mechanical knowledge of automobiles, let alone Porsches,  (medical
research PhD type) and I feel he needs help!!!

Is there anyone in the Ft Lauderdale area who can help him with a mech check of a S4
928????  I talked to him last weekend and he had found 2 that he was going out to look
at. Is there a local individual, PCA contact or specific maintainace shop he could
call ? Since this is his first Porsche, I don't want him to get one that will be
unreliable and a endless money pit. ( I've got a couple of those !!!) I don't know how
close he is to finding one, (or one for me) but I'd like to find someone or a shop who
could help make the right purchase.

Thanks for any info -- email to me and I'll relay it to him.

p.s. Anyone have info on Holmsted for PCA events ?? I'm thinking on getting down there
this spring with one of my 911s-- If I get them back together.....
