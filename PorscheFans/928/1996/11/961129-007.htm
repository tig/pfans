I too an a recent (or soon to be)  addition to the 928 club and have greatly
enjoyed the informative dialogue on this group. A comment and 2 questions.
Comment:         To all perspective and recent 928 owners, Excellence
magazine had a very complete and useful market report on the 928(1978-1995)
in the issue still on the newstands. I found this primer very useful on the
chronology and development of this series (both US abd European).

Q1:     I found the car of my dreams ( and within my budget8)!) about 30
miles from my home at a clearance center (??). This Guards red , all
original 86 928s -90K (delivery on Monday ) was thoroughly checked by a
Porsche Mechanic and very reputiable shop( Bill Gordon , Greenboro NC) from
head to toe including compression check, etc. He has not seen a finer 86 in
recent history. However the dealer, in transporting the car back to his lot,
burned the clutch out  literally hours before I was originally due to pick
it up ( Don't ask). The dealer has, at his expense , with all new parts and
his (VW) mechanic replaced the clutch. When I went to pick it up today,
however, the car would only go into gear ( R>>1>2-5) with much resistance.
When the car warmed up for 30-40 mintues of highway driving, it worked fine
in all gears, equally. My mechanic is going to check it out and "make it
right." Any ideas on what the problem is now?  And yes, the mechanic bled
the clutch slave cylinder (twice but correctly??). Anyway, your comments
would be greatly appreciated.

Q2:     I am now thoroughly indoctrinated on the expense and heartbreak of
porsche parts, availablity and service. I think that this is what they meant
when they said "Porsche. There is no substitute." I would be interested in
knowing what people budget for yearly manitenance for their 928's, and
whether  how much they drive them (daily,weekend,etc).

Thanks and  keep driving.
