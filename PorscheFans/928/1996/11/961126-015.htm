I won't disguise my prejudice in recommending a 928 to you, particularly
anS4 or later (i.e., '87 model year or later). Since you're a e-mail guy,
you'll recognize that you have posed a FAQ, and this list does not have an
organized collection of such, along with their canonical answers.

So, I'm sending you copies of a couple of posts to others who had similar
concerns. Meanwhile, stay tuned to this list and consult its archives.

In my unbiased opinion, the latter choice is better. "87-88 cars are all
S4s; the GT came out in '89. In these years, both lines came with 5-speeds
(the S4 also with auto).

>1) 5-speeds seem really scarce during this 
>period.  Is it going to be next to impossible
>to find one?

Not according to the ads I see in Hemmings Motor News (a VERY dangerous
publication for motorheads), in Panorama (the excellent Porsche Club of
America magazine, which you'll get when you join PCA, which you can't do
until you buy a Porsche), and on the various car-sales Web sites. And do
persevere; even though the auto has remarkably good performance numbers,
nothing beats the control and involvement the stick gives you. By the way,
make sure the car you get has a limited slip differential (look for code
220 on the tag under the mat in the trunk)

>2) Is it worth paying to have a specialty used dealer
>locate one?

Not unless that dealer also takes some measure of responsibility for
getting you what you thought you were buying. Someone needs to check the
car thoroughly before your commit, and that someone will probably be a
mechanic you trust.

>Can the same be done with 928s, or do most parts have to be
>purchased Porsche direct?

There are several tiers of third-party parts sources, as you'll see by
reading the ads in Panorama (see above) and Excellence (see any good
newsstand). You can get good prices on factory parts, you can get parts
from wrecked cars, and everything in between.

>3) How is overall reliability?

Generally very high. Apart from the comfort and versatility of the car, its
dependability keeps it at the top of my list for almost any kind of touring
or trip.

>what about the biggies like water pump/timing belt problem?

You check these (and all other vital parts) frequently, replace the belt
often (and the tensioner less often), and replace the water pump as soon as
there's any suggestions that this is a Good Thing (and don't buy the least
expensive part when you do).

>4) This is a nebulous question, but your answers 
>matter: What do you like/dislike most about driving
>your 928s?

I like:

- the tremendous, instantly available power. If I want to go, I go now,
without waiting for the turbo to spool up, the engine to come on cam, the
transmission to get into the right gear, or anything else. This is why big,
high compression, naturally aspirated V8s were created, and the 928 is the
platform in which you get all the big V8 goodies without compromise in any
other respect

- the responsive and beautifully mannered handling. There's no sudden
transition to extreme oversteer, no lag in steering (especially with 17"
wheels and top-quality modern sport tires, such as the Michelin Pilot SX
MXX3 N0), and no shortage of plain old stick. Uneven roads do not upset the
car or its occupants. If you want to go fast and not have to worry or be in
contention with the car (can you say "930"?), this is the means.

- the wonderful brakes. Press the pedal and you just stop; press harder and
you stop faster; harder still and you stop faster than you ever did before.
No bad habits at all.

- the comfort of the seats and interior. It's a nice place to spend time,
either cruising or roaring.

- the looks; simple, powerful, but not ostentatious

- damn near everything else

I don't like:

- the shortage of storage space for articles small and large, particularly
when it's time for a serious trip.

>With any luck I'll have that 928

Good luck! Tell us about cars you find, and make sure your questions about
any one are answered before you put down your money.

- - - - - - -  

>This is going to be a major investment for me

What's your price range? What's your average annual maintenance tolerance
(in money or time?)

>In your opinion, what should I look for in terms of model, year, options?

More recent cars have higher performance. The first significant jump was in
'83, then a big one in '85 (the 928 S), then a very big one in '87 (the 928
S4). From that point on, very little changed; the 928 GT ('89-91) adds 10
bhp and a little bit of temperament. The 928 GTS (the last 928 model,
introduced in '93; there were no '92 928 cars in the US) adds another 20
bhp and standard 17" wheels.

You've already been advised to look for the cleanest, soundest car you can
afford, and I second this, while encouraging you to reach for an S4 or GT
if you can afford a sound one.

Automatic transmission gives remarkably good numbers, but not the involved
feel or the supreme control of the stick. Prior to '88, some cars did not
come with limited slip differential (look for code 220 on the tag under the
trunk mat); I regard LSD as vital (don't quote me out of context, now).
Sport shocks (code 474) are regarded by many as too harsh for the benefit
they offer; they may spoil the car as a daily driver and tourer, at which
roles it otherwise should excel.

>What problems should I look for when test driving a 928?

Based on examples I experienced, reject a car which hesitates in response
to full throttle, or which must be "wound up" to accelerate strongly.
Braking (a particularly strong point of all 928 models) should be powerful,
straight, progressive, and drama-free. Steering should be crisp and should
self-center without drag.

>If you were going to purchase another 928, what would you look for?

The original window sticker. Complete service and parts documentation.
