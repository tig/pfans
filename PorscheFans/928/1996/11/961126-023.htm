You're welcome. There's more to say when you get closer to shopping 928 cars.

Yes, although there are a lot of thrashed cars out there which are not
bargains at any price. You can get a superb S4 stick for no more than about
$25,000, and you'll have a car comparable to just about anything on wheels,
including Ferrari's 456 GT, which costs ten times that. A good 928 is a
stunning bargain.

>In your opinion, why have they not held their value like the 911's?

Hard to say for sure, but there are several factors which I think apply here:

- Porsche AG never did much to promote or position the car. After a few
very minor efforts, they gave up on racing the 928 altogether, and so lost
the part of the market which requires a model to be raced in order to be
taken seriously.

- Porsche AG also backed away from its initial intention for the 928, which
was to have replaced the 911, when the 911 community went berserk. This had
less to do with the merits of the 928 than the feeling that the 911 is a
"special" design and can never be replaced. Porsche shifted gears and
started replacing the less visible parts of the 911 (e.g, the 964, then the
993, soon the "911" with the water-cooled boxer engine from the Boxster) in
order to address basic issues, mostly associated with handling and stopping.

- The suppression of the 928 by Porsche AG also had to do with its having
been the idea of Ernst Fuhrmann, a brilliant man who ran Porsche AG for a
while, but was moved aside by the Porsche family. When this happened, his
projects were allowed to fade away.

- These two factors left the 928 with no firm role in the Porsche lineup.
It wasn't (relatively) inexpensive, like the 944, nor was it brutal, like
the Turbo. PCNA had no idea how to promote or advertise the car, so they
basically didn't.

- Apart from all that, I've come to feel that the 928 offers a package
which doesn't thrill the American motorist. It's a fabulous
ultra-high-speed touring car, but you can't do that here. With that aspect
taken away, it doesn't do much that a 944 or 968 can't do, and costs a lot
more. The gold-chain crowd find it too understated and unknown. Corvette
lovers love their 'Vettes. The Eldorado and Mercedes SL crowds like what
they've got. The racers find relatively little speed equipment available
and don't see others racing the cars, so they stay away.

>Also, iyo, what is going to happen to servicing and parts
>availability due to the fact these aren't in production anymore?

A nice aspect of Porsche AG's neglect of the 928 is that it changed very
little over time, particularly since 1987. The last 928 GTS made is very
little different from my car, so parts are not going away anytime soon. In
addition, Porsche AG and PCNA have been good about keeping parts for older
cars available, largely because of the steady interest in 911 cars thirty
or more years old, most of whose parts are very different from those of
recent or current 911s (see above).

Servicing has always been a problem, because 928s are not 911s, or even
944s, and most Porsche dealerships and independent shops are not generally
rich in 928 knowledge or experience. However, a good 928 shop will be busy
with that practice for a long time.
