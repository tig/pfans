Hi everybody,

       I've already posted twice, but would like to now introduce myself. My name is Angel Paredes, and i am a 
33 yr. old Mechanical Engineer.  I've had my '89GT since July 15, 1995. It's been a blast so far. I even took 
the car to a PCA Driver Education track event(April '96) at Limerock Park, CT( i live in northeastern NJ).  Not 
surprisingly i was the only 928 there, the majority being the lighter 911's and 944's.  I was extremely pleased 
with the performance of the car, being able to hold my own(novice group), despite the added weight of my car.  
A great experience overall. Hope to go to a few more tracks next year.

    Now for the question part.  A couple of months ago i started to hear a squeaking/ticking sound coming from 
the clutch housing area.  The noise disappears when i apply the slightest bit of pressure on the clutch pedal. 
 Not long after this i decided to bleed the brake and clutch(slave cylinder) fluid.  It's possible the fluid 
may not have been changed ever.  Even though the car is an '89, it only had 14,900 miles on it.  Well, right 
after this the noise went away very temporarily and the clutch action felt smoother.  Noise is back.  Could 
this be the possible beginning to clutch slave cylinder degradation/failure.  The noise seems to be due to be 
clutch assembly being vibrated while the engine is running.  Could it be that the the slave cylinder actuating 
rod at its rest state provides some amount of pressure againt the clutch actuating lever that prevents the unit 
from vibrating freely?  This would explain why light pressure on the clutch quiets the noise.  Possibly a slave 
cylinder with the first signs of degrading seals no longer holds this light pressure allowing the assembly to 
vibrate freely?? 

    Anybody have any ideas or advice?


     Thanks,

      Angel
