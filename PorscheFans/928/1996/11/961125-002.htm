Thanks Leonard for the warning.  It's nice to know somebody cares.  I guess 
your assumption is that the lower pressure in the rear results in less 
traction than the front.  On the contrary, with 32 in the front, I have found 
them to be quite well balanced with 28 in the rear.  I also believe that the 
even wear at 28 is an indication that more of the tire is in contact with the 
pavement than at higher pressures where uneven wear occurs.

Your comments and suggestions are always welcomed and appreciated.
