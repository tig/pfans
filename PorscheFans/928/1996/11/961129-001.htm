Congratulations!

Please check your records and see how recently the timing belt was
replaced, and if the belt tensioner has been replaced. Both would be
worthwhile preventive maintenance if not done recently. The same goes for
replacing the fluid in the brake and hydraulic clutch circuits, and
flushing and correctly refilling the cooling system.

What brand/model/size of tires do you have?

Congratulations (2)!

I kinda like my little tank slot, but would enjoy sitting further up.

Almost certainly, with proper care. You may want to do at least a
compression check, if not a leakdown test, to benchmark the engine right
now and spot any boo-boos.

Congratulations (3)!

Do everything you can to avoid petty distractions (e.g., work, home life)
so you can spend the maximum amount of time in your car. Best of luck!
