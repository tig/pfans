Greetings P-nuts,

After indulging in an elegant , quiet,thanksgiving meal with my wife and
daughter...I cleaned up the kitchen and sat down in time to catch the late
evening news afterwards...

The news was ugly...first thing on the screen was an account of some
dipshit in a 993 ragtop DRAG RACING down PC Highway 1 near Sunset Boulevard
(this is L.A.,)...This idiot was racing against a bike , apparently a
"crotch rocket"...which left the scene immediately, witnesses think it was
a Honda or Kaw).  anyway, the account stated that the guy in the Carrera
lost control, and spun around into the opposite lane and connected (sorta
sideways-from passenger side, judging from footage) with a minivan packed
with a family enroute somewhere.
The Toll: Porsche "driver" dead, and one minivan adult passenger dead, and
rest of the minvan  passengers injuries ranging from beat up to serious.
The footage was awful...

So, what's my point?  my point is simply to remind us all of the SHEER
STUPIDITY of racing on the street... any street.  If you want to race (and
I do)...hit the track, drag strip, whatever...just get the hell off the
street.   We are Porsche owners and enthusiasts...this doesn't mean we're
not obligated to pay attention to the constant threat of these misguided
bozos on bikes, other hi-perf cars, etc.  Porsches are a real temptation to
these people...don't get sucked in, drive carefully, pay attention and
live.

Asofar as this clown who just died and killed somebody else in the
process...the news report didn't say anything about whether this carrera
was stolen...(does that matter?)

Thanks for indulging me...

Cheers
Thom Kuby
