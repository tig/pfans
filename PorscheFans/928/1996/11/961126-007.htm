Scott: If there's anything I've ever learned from diddling around with tire
pressures is: don't diddle around with tire pressures.
So many myths and old wives' tales exist about tires and how to adjust
pressures. You know: "Drop that pressure, dear, the tires will get hot on the
highway and the pressures will climb on their own". Indeed, manufacturers
recommend different tire pressures should you have loaded the family station
wagon to the hilt...but how often is that? Furthermore, to the increase in tire
pressures due to long distance driving: tire manufacturers recommend cold
adjustments, the effects of heat are taken into consideration.
I always go from the following standpoint: manufacturers of serious cars are not
stupid. Manufacturers of serious tires are also not dumb. When these two reach a
requirement for a specific tire for a particular car, the pressures that the
tire manufacturer recommends is not a chance occurance but something mirroring
his experience. 
Here in Germany, driving on those few remaining kilometers of unlimited speed
Autobahns, where a few stints of short or long duration at 200+ km/h are not
unusual, I have yet to met anyone who does something to the tire pressures of
his sports or family car to compensate for any effects due to high speed. The
drivers here assume that the tire pressures recommended by company ABC are based
on scientific tests and are correct for his vehicle. Even participants at
driving schools at Hockenheim or Nurburgring don't adjust (but check!) pressures
before a day of driving on the track. 
OK, once you get slaloming, then you can start playing raising or lowering tire
pressures, influencing understeer or oversteer. I notice that you've drastically
reduced the rear pressures of your car. If you were to slalom that way, you'd
get quite a lot of oversteer. Also on public roads you will find that the car
seems sloppy at the rear. A psi or so is not noticeable but going from 44 to 28
is drastic. Your tire wear will certainly increase quickly. 
Again, if a manufacturer recommends 35 and 44, then, unless you're going to do
some serious motoring, or if you're a tire engineer or a test driver, then I
wouldn't play with tire pressures just to reduce noise.
