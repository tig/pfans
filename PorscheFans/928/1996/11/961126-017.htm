Jim Harriger asked:

>> -find a set of springs from a 928 that had gas shocks standard. anybody
know how to identify these? <<

My '82 928 has the "Sport Package" option which includes gas-filled Bilstein shocks.  
The Service manual says the gas-filled shocks are green in color and mine are.  I 
can't remember the color of the standard shocks.  I think some later cars and any S 
versions may have had gas shocks as standard.  I'm sure there are adapters/kits 
available.  The mail order catalog companies have special instructions and kits 
available for converting shocks.

>> (btw, anyone spoken to devek on the phone this week?, i can	never get through and 
they haven't returned my call) <<

I just called 1-800-598-0693 and also tried the Technical hotline 1-415-592-5287 and 
got recordings both times.  DEVEK is a very small company (now 2 person).  If Marc or 
Susan are away, there is likely no other person available to answer.  I met them this 
last summer at a swap meet, so I know the company is real.
