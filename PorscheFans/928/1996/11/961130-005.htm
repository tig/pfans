Definately!  Did you know that Susan came in first in the 140mph class in Nevada?  Her 
run and Mark's 165mph run are in the Devek video.  Flat out mile after mile after mile 
in an '89 S4!

Those of us lucky enough to live close to their shop can drop by and see 2 - 5 cars at 
any one time undergoing transformation.  My friend's '85 928S is getting it's first 
overbore and I keep pestering him to having Devek mill the heads and advancing cams now 
while it's apart.  

Yes please help patronize them.  Their pricing is very competitive on many items and 
services.  Plus what other 928 company welcomes you to join them for "One Lap of 
America"?

Phil
