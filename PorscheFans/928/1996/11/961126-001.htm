Good for you. How many miles? Stick or auto? What color? What brand and
model of tires? How well documented is the car and its history? What have
you been driving until now?

>What a car!!!  I love it!!!

That's what makes fans. A healthy 928 is one of the best drugs available.

>I can't believe how inexpensive this car was!!!

Curious, isn't it? Ferrari manages to get a quarter of a million for the
very similar 456 GT.

>Can anyone tell me why 928's don't hold there value better? 

Porsche AG's desertion of the model may have something to do with it. The
928 has very low recognition, courtesy of little promotion and less
development by the factory.

First, make sure the car's healthy as it stands. Unless all of the
following have been done recently, replace the timing belt, the tensioner
and the guides (new belts have a new tooth profile which can slip out of
old guides). Drain and refill the transaxle. Ditto the brakes and hydraulic
clutch. Ditto the cooling system. Have a four-wheel alignment done by
someone who knows his stuff (do this whenever replacing tires and/or
wheels). Replace all the other belts and hoses (cheap insurance).

Then, see below.

>Not that I am ready to do them, but it is always good to know.

Glad you said this. You have a car with extremely and deceptively high
performance straight out of the box. It will take you a while to get the
full measure of what the car can do, and it's worth doing this before
making any serious modifications. Drive the car smoothly and hard; let it
show just how good it is!

That disclaimer having been made, there are two broad categories of things
you can do.

The first has to do with giving you more of what you like about the car
without compromising its comfort or general utility as a touring car.

Try a K&N air filter. It drops in where your stock unit goes, you clean and
re-oil it whenever you like so you've always got a clean filter, and it
gave me (and others I've heard from) a feelable improvement in power.

Put bright bulbs in your headlights (I'm running 80/100 watt units) and
driving lights so you can see where you're going at night at speed.

If you don't have the owner's manual, get it (from Automotion, Performance,
or other mail order sources advertising in Panorama or Excellence), along
with a spec book (loads of technical details about your car).

Speaking of Panorama, join the Porsche Club of America (jump to their Web
site from the PorscheFans site). This is NOT a gold chain snob society;
rather, it is a stunningly active and competent group of interested parties
who support each other in ways it wills take you quite a while to absorb,
including autocross and track events to get you acquainted with the higher
ranges of your car's performance.

Mount a fire extinguisher in a reachable location inside the car (more
cheap insurance, and needed for those PCA track events).

Fill your crankcase with synthetic oil (I'm using Amsoil Series 2000
20W50). The engine will rev more freely, run a little cooler, start more
readily at low temperatures, and be better protected.

Tires and wheels can make a big difference. As a first step, you may want
to locate a pair of the 8x16 forged rims from the rear of the '87-88 S4. My
favorite Porsche wheel source, Wheel Enhancement's Robert Wood
(310/836-8908) says these are freely available (for reasons discussed
below), and you should be sure to get your wheels from a trustworthy
source, lest you be dramatically disappointed by a failure at speed.

On these wheels, put 245/45x16 tires (keep the 225/50x16 tires on 7x16 rims
up front). This will give you more positive handling and less wheelspin
under hard acceleration. Front and rear tires should be the same brand and
model, and there are many fine ultra-performance tires available (I like
the Michelin Pilot SX MXX3, but the Bridgestone S-02, Dunlop SP 8000,
Continental CZ 91, and Yokohama AVS Intermediate are also worthy
candidates). Porsche has worked with some tire makers to tweak their
designs; this is commemorated by Porsche's N0 or N1 spec.

The next step in rolling stock is to 17" wheels and tires. The 928 GTS came
with 225/45x17 tires on 7.5x17 rims in front, and 255/40x17 on 9x17 rear. I
went to this combination on my car earlier this year and am thrilled with
the improvement. A package in these sizes, with proper offsets (talk to
Robert) should fit on your car without modifications. Avoid the temptation
to go to 18" equipment; the ride will become too hard and you'll bend rims
on potholes.

I had very good results from a custom reprogramming of the engine's fuel
and ignition control computers. This was done by Autosport Designs
(516/248-0066; talk to Tom or Barry), a singularly competent shop who have
the requisite chassis dyno and all the knowledge and tools to do a proper
remap. This cost a few hundred dollars more than generic chips, but gave
much better results (probably another 40+ bhp, plus much crisper throttle
response).

Leave the exhaust and headers alone until such time as you choose to do a
comprehensive redo of the engine (see below). For the most part, just
replacing these parts will not give more power, and will give a lot more
noise.

The second broad category has to do with radical redos. Don't do this
before you've given the car a very good chance to show you its stuff, and
even then be careful about losing touring versatility.

If you're a very serious autocrosser, or if the car is destined for the
track, you can replace the springs and shocks with stiffer units. Porsche
supplied "sport shocks" in the M030 package for cars slightly later than
yours. The aftermarket has both progressive and non-progressive stiff
springs. Apart from hard ride, this will probably lower the car, and the
real world isn't totally flat (graunch!!).

If you want (there's an open issue about how much any of us needs) lots
more power (more than a good reprogramming of the control computers), the
limited development history of the 928 4V engine (limited, that is,
compared to the 911 engine, the Corvette engine, or even the 944/968
engine) generally says "enlarge the engine". Nothing beats cubic inches,
and there are several approaches to getting them.

Renntech in Florida are one of the few places in the US which actually
practices the art of boring and honing the silicon-rich aluminum of which
your car's cylinders are made. By boring and stroking the engine (and thus
replacing all the internal parts, for a lot of money), they've made engines
as big as 6.5 liters.

However, the cylinder walls are none too thick to start with, and the stock
engine is very oversquare, so just stroking the engine is safer and less
expensive. Porsche did this in house with the 928 GTS (5.4 liter), and
Devek now has a 6 liter package, which appears to deliver about 100 bhp
more than stock.

You can also encourage more air to enter the engine. There is at least one
healthy turbo 928 operating today (Hi, Richard!), and some solid plans to
supercharge at least one 928.

When you do engine work this serious, you'll probably replace your cams,
headers, and exhaust system.

With more power, you'll want the best brakes and rolling stock. Your car
probably already has the legendary "S4" brakes, which are more than enough
for stock/street purposes. When you go into the power ozone or onto the
track, you can further upgrade to the GTS brakes (which won't fit into 16"
wheels) or to parts from Wilwood and other race-oriented makers.

While the right cast wheels (talk to Robert) are OK for the street, you'll
want forged wheels for ultra-performance purposes. Talk to Devek, HRE,
Fikse, or others who make ultra-strong wheels (as opposed to ultra-strong
claims). Depending on how high you crank things up, you may want to flare
the rear fenders and go to real wide tires (up to 315-335 section), but
you'll need to block the "Weissach axle" feature if you do.

If you've gone this far, it's time for racing seats and 5-point harnesses.

OK, take a deep breath, return to reality, and go drive and enjoy your car.
