I will be going down the same road as you, but with my 928.  The gauge will go past the 
3/4 mark frequently, especially stop&go but sometimes even on the freeway (???).  I have 
ordered the lo-temp fan switch & thermostat.  Guess I will add hoses, fan belt and a 
flush and see where that takes me.  The car does not overheat to the red (yet) so I'll 
hold off on a new radiator, etc. just hope I am not cooking the engine!  Changing oil 
frequently as another precaution.

I saw there was some coolant additive that eats away old rust & buildup but was kinda 
hesitant (would drano hurt your pipes?) since it may accelerate having to get a new 
radiator!

A friend with a 944T had a bad story.  His had a pinhole in the lower hose which caused 
the car to overheat.  He just HAD to continue to drive the car.  Anyways, he said the 
engine suffered top end problems and burned out the thermal reactor or something.  Cost 
$4000 +   

Ouch!
Phil
