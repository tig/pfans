928 International should still have the solenoid and nozzle from the NOs
system I took out of my '81 928 convertible. It was a single nozzle into
the front of the plenum. C.A.R.B. wouldn't have liked it.

The  p.o. put a nitrous bottle in the spare wheel well and ran a braided
line up the chassis into the engine compartment. the Nitrous switch was
under the accelertor pedal at full travel. It wasn't working when I bought
the car, so I can't testify as to the efficacy.

According to 928 International, the 928 engine has a design flaw in
lubrication, so I'd be reeeeel cautious about adding horses... or
sustaining high RPMs.
