Thanks to Leonard for an excellent recap of the S4 928's development.  Just 
a couple corrections/additions:

1) The so-called "S4" brakes (304 mm front rotors) actually first appeared 
at serial number 1000 of the 1986 "S3" cars, although with slightly 
different calipers.  As Leonard says, the brakes were made yet-larger some 
time later, but I don't remember when...maybe the GTS.  My 85-89 Tech Spec 
book doesn't mention it, so it must have been '90 or later.

2) The numerically-higher rear-end ratio (2.2000-->2.7272) change occurred 
as of the 1989 model year.  Limited slip differential was standard on the 
5-speed that year.

My favorite 928 would be an '89 5-speed, because of the gearing. I never 
saw any significant value in what was added/done after that (although the 
computer would be fun). Unlike Leonard, I always found the 2.20 ratio 
absurd.  It basically made 5th gear superfluous (1,800 RPM @ 60?!?), and 
1st gear hard on the clutch and difficult on hills.  That combined with 
giving up about 20% of my available rear-wheel torque always infuriated me.

3) The '87 cars introduced a mechanically simpler and smaller induction 
system that made the engine *way* easier to work on.  This alone probably 
would have allowed me to own an '87 for the same net outlay over 4 years as 
my '86 cost.  Furthermore, since in the post-'86 cars you could actually 
*see* the cylinder heads, lifting the hood was a much more esthetically 
satisfying experience.  The '85 and '86 US cars had an engine obscured by 
massive horizontal "organ pipes" that had to be disassembled to do anything 
to the top of the engine.  There are lots of hoses, sensors, connectors, 
etc. under those pipes that need occasional replacing, etc.

4) The '87 cars introduced a simpler, tougher and less troublesome 
single-plate clutch.  All prior years had a dual-plate clutch that tended 
to wear out prematurely and to shudder until it wore out.

The only reason I'm bringing up the pre-'87 issues is just to suggest that 
anyone contemplating an '85 or '86 purchase hold out for an '87.  One might 
be tempted to buy a significantly cheaper '85 or '86, but if I had it to do 
all over again, I wouldn't.  I'd spring for an S4, *especially* an '89 or 
later 5-speed.

It's important to note that later 5-speed 928s are hard to find, because 
something like 80% or more of production was automatics.  I *absolutely* 
would hold out for a 5-speed, in fact I would get an '86 5-speed before I 
got any S4 automatic.  But once again, that's a matter of taste.
