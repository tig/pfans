Paul,
  I will investigate the questions you posed. 
Am I wrong in assuming you think this may be "normal?" 

I believe you may have hit on something with the sense lead...hmmm

The Alternator in this car is a AC-Delco 150 amp unit. Power supply is 
not a problem just when the battery is fully charged it drops to a very 
low output at low RPM.

Beginning to become enlightened.
