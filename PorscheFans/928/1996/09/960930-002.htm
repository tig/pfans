RE: S4 and later advantages

Yes that's true you can get to more stuff around the S4 intake.

Although there is still a mess of hoses under it (vacuum controls etc) which 
you have to remove the intake dome to replace.  The front passengar side 
crankcase breather hose seems a fairly common item to fail (only one they had
in stock at the dealer when I replaced my hoses).  And the intake is a dome 
versus the 8 rubber pipe (which can wear out and leak) approach used earlier.

The double disc clutch seems to be a problem for some mechanics to balance,
although if done correctly is supposedly smoother.  There may actually be a 
mistake in the manuals as to how to balance the second clutch (I think the 
tech guy said that last year) which could cause problems in its operation.

I hope I don't sound like a 928 snob (among an already supposedly snobbish 
group ;) when I say generally, the S4 is a "grown up" 928.  They seemed to 
redesign all the stuff they found problematic as well as "super sizing" 
the advantages of the car that were already there.
