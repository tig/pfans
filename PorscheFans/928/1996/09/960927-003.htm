Good idea! Check the ads in Panorama and on the various Web car sales sites.

>I'm trying to find out the differences between the S4 model years.

The 928S was replaced worldwide for the 1987 model year by the 928 S4, sold
with both manual (e.g., my car) and automatic transmissions. This was a
radical upgrade from the older cars, featuring lots more power, much bigger
and more powerful brakes (these are the "S4" brakes widely discussed in the
911 community), better aerodynamics, wider rear tires, and all kinds of
little goodies.

Because Porsche AG saw fit to abandon the 928, it received very little
development after the huge changes that produced the S4 in 1987.  In 1989,
Porsche brought out the 928 GT, with a slightly tuned engine (+10 bhp), a
more nervous temperament, wider rims (by one inch) and manual transmission
only. The 928 S4 carried on in parallel, still available with moth manual
and automatic.

Later (I think in 1990), Porsche stopped selling manual transmission S4s,
assuming that sporty customers would prefer the GT. In 1992, Porsche
replaced all previous models worldwide with the 928 GTS, with slightly
larger (+400 cc) motor, slightly bigger wheels and front brakes, and your
choice of manual or automatic transmission. This model went out of
production in 1995 (I think), ending the 928 line.

A subtle difference between '87-'88 and newer cars is the final drive
ratio. The first S4s came into the US with a 2.20:1 ratio, apparently to
improve fuel economy. Later cars have a higher ratio, which will improve
acceleration, but top speeds in intermediate gears are reduced.

The autocross guys (e.g., Kim Crumb, the 928 tech honcho for the PCA) like
the higher ratio. I prefer the lower ratio so that I can stay in a gear
(e.g 110+ in 3rd) while accelerating through a long bend or making a pass
and just use the power of the engine (which is remarkably augmentable by
simple, external, relatively inexpensive measures).

Limited slip was not standard until '89, but is necessary for stable
operation, so make sure any car you shop has it (look for code 220 on the
tag on the gas tank, under the trunk mat).

The biggest difference between an '87 S4 and a '96 GTS is the price you'll
have to pay today. Unless you really want the trip computer ('90 and
later), airbags (ditto), tire pressure sensors (which caused enough trouble
that Porsche took them off the most recent cars) or other minor changes,
look for the healthiest S4 you can find.

Prices now are in the low-to-high $20ks for good examples, and this is a
deal and half for this remarkable combination of brute performance and
touring comfort.

>I hope to find a 928 that will keep my interest and enthusiasm for just as
long !!!

You'll be amazed by how widely useable the car is, and how easily it runs
away from nearly anything on the road.

Good hunting!
