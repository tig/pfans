Hey All,
   No, not Hit Points for those of you who used to (still do) play role 
playing games!

Leonard Laub recently posted a message regarding high horsepower 928s.
While I have a highly modified motor/drivetrain, I cannot, in all 
honesty, recommend it for the non-tinkerer. It has been relatively 
trouble free over the few years i have had the car, but does require 
constant fiddling to keep it running properly. 

High Strung cars require more TLC than stock vehicles.

Not that this is a bad thing at all, but be aware that modifying your car 
away from stock will create its own set of problems. (See the Thread on 
Nitrous!)

However, the benefits can, without a doubt, pay off!
The car which used to run at a constant 11PSI of boost from Callaway now 
has been approved to run as high as 16PSI ( although I run at 14.5PSI) 
Reeves Callaway himself and Mike Zoner his head engineer agree that this 
boost level combined with the Discrete secondary fuel injection system 
and new wastegates will remain trouble free (they hope) I believe them, 
but still run the car at 14.5 ;)

Leonard, we should meet halfway so you can try the car out again. the 
difference between 11PSI and 14.5PSI is quite amazing, even to me!
And of course the lower OAT (Outside Air Temperature) Helps quite a bit 
as well, since Callaway has npt yet finished my redesigned intercoolers. 
They should be finished and installed sometime this Winter (Sigh.)

Rich
Rambling On and On and On....
