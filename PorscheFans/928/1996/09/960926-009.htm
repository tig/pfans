No, not as designed, but rather as things often work
in real life ;-)  For actual occurance rates, you will
have to ask the list.  I watch, and think about getting
a 928, but do not have one.   I am an EE, and get into
some offroading, and we offroaders run above average
loads at low RPMs, so have these problems.

I also have a Suburban, with 2 A/C units, and so the draw
can be 60A, which is a problem in stop-and-go traffic. I put
in a 120A alternator, and it only produces about 10A at idle.

As soon as I rev up a bit, the output goes up, and my lights
get white again.

If you don't have a grounding problem, I speculate that
your sense point may be effected more by the state of
charge of you battery than you want.  Especially if you have 
modified the system, and run a heavy wire directly from
the alternator output to your battery.  Many guys then also
connect the sense lead to the same heavy wire to the battery.
Now, the battery is well charged, and regulated, but the
system voltage varies.  Such is not all bad, as most of the
electronics does not care too much about the voltage,
provided it is above 10-11V.  The battery; however, does
like to be charged.

I'm going to be in Tokyo next week, so if you have questions
next week, and I don't answer, it is only because I have not
read my mail.
