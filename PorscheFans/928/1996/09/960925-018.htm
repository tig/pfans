My lovely wife, Connie, and I went to the 41st Annual Porsche Parade,
sponsored by the Cimarron and War Bonnet regions of the Porsche Club,
and held at the Shangri-La Resort at Grand Lake O' the Cherokees in 
Northeast Oklahoma (near the thriving metropoli of Grove and Afton).

Anyhow, it took a couple of days for us to drive from Eastern New York,
about 9 hours to Columbus, OH, and about 12 hours from Columbus to 
Afton.  Automap had estimated 26 hours, so I was pleased with the
transit time. (Of course, the prime concern was speed traps (few) and
breakdowns (none on our 105K 83 944 track car).

We arrived Saturday afternoon, too late to register for the parade, but 
managed to run into a couple of friends from Zone 1 and went to dinner 
together.

Sunday was registration, and, for a bit in the morning, watching some
concours prep. That was shortlived, since Hurricane Fausto managed to
park its butt over head and dump a bunch of rain on almost all of the 
cars (the exceptions being those arriving in enclosed trailers). Welcome
banquet was good (ate too much...)

Monday, up and at em, I reported to my station to do concours scoring at 
7 am, cars were already being positioned on the soggy lawn (but the rain
had stopped about midnight) and we started getting ready for the scoring.
1995 was the last year for the Manhattan trophy, so this year, the cars
were grouped into Restoration, Preparation and Preservation groups, each
with different scoring parameters.  We ended up having to reconstruct
all of the reports, and rebuild most of the database on the fly, but managed
to get it done before the judges were done, so no noticeable delay on 
our part.  The overall preparation award (the new manhattan trophy :-))
went to Linda Morse for her 1993 964 Carrera 2, which was beautifully
prepared as always. (She was also the winner of the Zone 1 Concours in June.)

Tuesday, Connie took off for Dallas and a Business Trip: I rallied (Pete
Tremper, Zone 1 Rep was my Driver; No experience necessary, just shut
up and drive; I navigated...) The rally took us for a ride around the
Grand Lake with very few traps. Our scores were good, double digits for
each of the legs. A couple of legs were protested out (two of our higher
scores) and we ended up with a score of 75 for 4 legs, good enough to 
take first place in unequipped (no jokes, please). Anyhow, sheer luck 
and following most of the instructions the first time around worked for us...


Wednesday, I took the day off and visited a friend of mine in Stillwater.
Although the trip was 150 miles each way, the 75 mph speed limit on the
interstates helped to make it tolerable. The rest of the parade was out
at Miami Airport, watching the watercooled class running the Autocross.

Thursday, Autocross at the Miami Airport.  Some rain in the morning, slowing
the early 911 class down, but the faster cars were able to get in clean,
dry runs. I now have a reason to buy lottery tickets: The twin turbo 993
is awesome!!!

Friday, Took the day off again, picked up Connie at the airport (she had
a business meeting in Dallas) and vegetated around ShangriLa, spending money
at the Goody Store, and generally cycling down.

Saturday, Tech Quiz... Very interesting format, The first 70 questions 
consisted of general questions drawn from Panorama articles, the Bosch
Automotive Handbook, and the Porsche Family Tree (booklet available from 
PCA National). The next 30 were "identify this part" from exploded diagrams
taken from 944, 924 and 968 microfiche parts catalogs. Much easier for
someone like myself who spends a lot of time researching just those kinds
of things. The last 18 questions were tie breakers, and most people only
got 4 or 5 or those...

There are a couple of people who obviously spend too much time
getting ready for these things -  the overall winner missed 3 out of 100
and 4 out of 18 tiebreakers. My own score was 22 out of 100 and 12 out of
18 (a much more well rounded person I must be), good enough for 8th place,
unfortunately, they only went 7 deep for trophies in my 944 class.

Saturday afternoon, the (volunteer) workers party, good food, lots of goodies
and door prizes. Connie won an Automotion gift Certificate, and I won a
Porsche Boutique Cooler (they gave away about 40 of those... John Takehara
jokingly said that he was going to start a Cooler Registry!)

Saturday Night, Victory Banquet (I ate too much) with Tech Quiz awards, 
sports and Art Show awards. San Antonio Parade Staff did a skit on "Why
you want to go to a parade in San Antone in June!" with the singing 
Armadillo.  Fred Schwab of PCNA did a report on the Boxster, including
the $39,980 list price (additional dealer profit not included).
And we all went back to pack up for an early departure.

Sunday: The riddle is: What has 850 bhp, carries 8 people comfortably, 
and gets 6 miles per gallon at 80 mph? 

Answer: Our caravan from the parade to Columbus Ohio.

700 miles in 12 hours during Sunday heavy traffic. A 993 (from 
New Hampshire), a 944S2 (from Massachusetts), a 944 Turbo (from Toronto)
and our 83 944 caravaned up and semi-legal speeds, and still managed
to get reasonable gas mileage, even at 80mph... Speed traps few and
far between, and the CB radio is alive and well in the midwest.

Monday: The rest of the way home. Tires getting noisier and noiser...
When I get home, the rears are gone, down to the cord. I knew they were
bad (excuse for not running the Autocross), but I sure got my money's 
worth out of them...

So, we'll do it again next year... We had a great time, met some more
wonderful people, and renewed old friendships...
