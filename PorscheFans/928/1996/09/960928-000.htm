Agreed, the S4 can be a great deal. Watch for cars that have spent their
lives in the sun, because interior damage can be a real headache--not only
the dash is affected, but the panels on either side of the rear compartment
can distort.

928s attracted a lot of one-time-only Porsche buyers whose prior experience
was Buick Rivieras or Datsun 280Zs, so one that has been properly
maintained is fairly rare. At least, that's my experience. And I've owned
four.

My favorite aspect of the 928 is that the harder you drive it, the smaller
and more agile it feels.

 P.S. One big bonus around here is that the 928 doesn't attract the
negative attention that the 911 does (envy scratches, mirror theft, etc.).
