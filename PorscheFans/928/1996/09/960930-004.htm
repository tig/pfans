Hey Gang,

	On NPR (National Public Radio) the other morning during the local
news segment they had on the guy responsible for overseeing the
emissions testing here in houston. What he said, after defending
himself that this is not Big Brother is that they are now setting up
roadside "sniffers" to monitor cars as they drive by. While this is
not new in CA it is new here. But what really bothered me was his
closing comment that the city wanted to know just how many cars were
polluting that lived in houston versus those that drove in from out
of town or state.

	Now, here in TX we do not really have our license plates divided out 
into a certain number/letters meaning that you are from a specific 
area. Soooo, how are they going to know if a car is city registered 
or not? Short of sniffing the car AND tagging the plate, and THEN 
running a check on the plate to see where he lives? This could make 
for a really nasty database.

	Trying to get an answer on this one from the city now.

take care
