I'm still looking to get myself  a S4 before spring.  I've got one more track weekend with
the 911, then it's up on blocks for the teardown and restoration. I just got a Blazer for
the boys ( and myself ) to use for the winter, so I won't be without wheels.

I'm trying to find out the differences between the S4 model years. My Porsche knowledge is
basically with 356s and early 911s. If the 928 is any thing like these, they seem to make
some small improvement each year. From what I can see, there seems to be be a big jump in
prices from 89 to 90.!!! Is this just due to the electro-hydro anti-lock, or just the lack
of avaliability of that year? When did the tire-pressure warning system first become
standard ??? What about the on-board computer ??? Since I'm looking for just the right car,
and don't seem to ever sell any (except in a moment of mental lapse when I sold my 356
Roadster !! ), I'm trying to get myself as much info as I can. I've had my 73 911 since
new, so I hope to find a 928 that will keep my interest and enthusiasm for just as long !!!

Thanks for any info...
