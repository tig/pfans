Could it be that it happens when the engine compartment & alternator
reach operating temperature? Diodes fail, contacts open, etc. when
they get hot enough?

Incidentally, that brings something to mind. Have all you 928ers taken a
look at the hose that feeds air to your alternator lately? Mine was a
wreck, with a couple of potential bad consequences:
- the alternator gets fed air that's full of road grit, instead of
relatively clean air from inside the fender,
- the wire inside the hose could spring loose and get tangled up with
the belts.
One other result could be that airflow over the outside air temperature
sensor for the climate control system would be diminished, reducing its
responsiveness. We do like our creature comforts, after all.
