Definately!  Heck, I never keep anything in the glove box anyways, plus it's air 
conditioned.  Oh wait a minute, not putting an amp in there... Well at least it's still 
good for CD's.

I have the factory eight speaker setup.  I guess there must be crossovers hidden all 
over the place.  Will probably have to bypass most of it to upgrade to a modern system 
like yours.  (BTW Your front doors don't have speakers in them?) I too thought about 
putting a sub-box in but really want the "stealth" look and need the luggage space.  I 
might check out those Panasonic sub enclosures and stick one in where the spare used to 
be, then do some creative cutting to the cover and mat. (How about motorizing the spare 
cover ehhe heh)   The amps etc. will probably go in there too?  Either that or in one of 
the under dash trays?   Gotta' plan this out right before I get started.  Not trying to 
win any SPL contests, just want better sound!  

6 1/2's fit for the rear?  Cool!  I can upgrade the same.  I have little 4's (?) also by 
the rear quarters.  Why I don't know.  I saw another 928 that the owner made plywood 
spacers and mounted 6x9's back there.  Couldn't have been enough rear volume under the 
speaker to sound right but then he didn't even take time to cover the plywood with 
anything either.

Hmm.  Maybe 6x9's or 4x10's will fit where the 6 1/2's go?  Does this make sense or 
should stick to pure component speakers?  Crutchfield doesn't even list Porsche's at 
all...
