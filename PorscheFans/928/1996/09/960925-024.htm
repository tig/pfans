Hi Phil, I put my CD changer in the glove box- it fits perfectly!  I did have
to cut out a bit of the 'box to get wires through and get the right angle,
but it is sooooo convenient in that location I've had no remorse!  It looks
REALLY cool too- the glove box light shines like a little spotlight on the
Alpine logo.  I can even lock it up, not that that would deter many theives-
but you never know.

As far as subs- I had a box custom built to fit right behind the rear seats,
taking up the trunk.  It houses two 10" JL Audio subs and a 300 Watt PPI amp
that is dedicated to the subs.  I had it covered in black speaker cloth so
it isn't very noticable- I made sure that it didn't look out of place or draw
attention.

My stereo place also managed to fit 6 & 1/2" coaxial Alpines in the rear
speaker spaces (on my 928 they are where the rear passangers' thighs hit).
The holes were only something like 5", but they prommised me that 6 & 1/2"'s
would fit before they opened up the car- so they stuck to their word and
worked overtime making the holes bigger so the Alpines would fit.

Overall the system sounds great!  I just need to add another amp and some
front speakers for propper imaging...

Hope this helped!

Sean  '80 Euro 928
