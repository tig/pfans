Inexpensive place to get parts. (Notice I didn't say cheap. We all know the 
difference: cheap costs you more later. ;) )

I have a Tweeks and an Automotion catalog. I have ordered a Devek (though I don't 
think cheap will apply there). 

I called a dealer, since Porsche's N. America home page says they are getting 
cheaper due to the Porsche Parts Express program, but the item I checked on was 
outrageous. I can get a rebuilt one from Automotion for about 25% of the cost, 
with a 6 month longer warranty. Makes sense to me...anyone have experience on 
that?

I'd be interested in hosting a 928 specific home page on my machine here. I can 
set it up to where it is very easy to manage from where you are. In exchange, you 
can send me 928 handmedown parts. ;) 

Anyone want to take on the task? I'd really like to see that sort of thing, as I 
haven't been able to find that much info. For example, a 928 FAQ. Nada.
