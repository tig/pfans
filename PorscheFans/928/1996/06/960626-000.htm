A couple friends of mine owned this car. It was an '82 928. They modified
it extensively. They ultimately brought it out to California and left it
with me for 3-1/2 months. I can assure you, it turns heads... They took it
to a D=Kruse auction in Scottsdale at the beginning of the year and sold it
for $47,000(!!!)

They are building a limited run of these cars, and the most recent one is
built on an S4 chassis and has a (beautiful) folding top.

I have attached jpegs of the car.for Sean Simmen.

Hi guys, I forget if I ever got this address through to Porschephiles before
it crashed...  In case I didn't, here are some pictures of a 928 Spyder that
I saw at the Summit Point Jefferson 500 Vintage Races.  It's pretty amazing...

Tell me what you think!
