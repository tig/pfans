Pholks,

Sorry about the flood of empty messages from Tony Lowery, 
(tlowery@seamail.nos.noaa.gov) who works in my office.  I've got him and
our sysadmin wallah trying to see what the story is, but this happened
when he sent a single message, which all received, commenting about how he
is in the market for a 928, and would like to see the various flavors
side-by-side before buying.

Unfortuantely, this message (sent through cc:mail) was sent while something
was down at Bell Atlantic this morning, something a cc:mail user has no way of 
knowing (one of many reasons I don't use my seamail account on the net).  I 
don't know if the problem is in our end or at Bell, but it *is* aggrivating!

If it is on our end, be assured that our folks are working on locating and 
correcting it even as we speak.  (Tony would be telling you this, but he's 
up to his posterior in very large reptiles at the moment, dealing with this).

Yer Kindly ol' Unka Bart
