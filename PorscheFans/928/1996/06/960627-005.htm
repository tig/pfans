PorsheFans-928,

I'm extremely interested in buying a 928, however I'm not sure which one, as 
I've only driven a ragged out 1985 with the red "!" light flashing on the 
instrument panel. Actually, I'm having trouble finding ones to look at. I missed 
Ski Round Top's meet this year (emergency) where I've been told some 928s for 
sale usually show up. I went to Carlise's Import Show a couple of months ago, 
but no luck. Only one 928 there but not for sale. What I'd really like is to go 
somewhere and see a bunch of 928, 928S, 928S4 and compare them against each 
other and talk to the owners as to the good/bad points of their year 928. I want 
see if they all have reverse where I usual shift into first, and if they do, 
I'll want to check out the auto transmission. Anyway, I'm not is a car fever 
rush on this and I'm not going to buy the first one I see. But, after I've done 
the hands the comparison, I'll be ready to buy.

Regards
Tony Lowery
Crofton, MD
