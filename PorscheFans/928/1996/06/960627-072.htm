for the manual.  This is the same for 911 and 944 I think.  There are
ALOT more automatics in 928s to choose from if you like those.

It took me a year to find a fair condition 928 to buy in my price range.
If I were to advise you I'd say find a mechanic, garage or reputable dealer
in your area who knows or sells Porsches and put the word in with him that
you're looking.  Pay a fair price for something good, not necessarily 
the lowest price car, but one with a good maintenance record.  Low miles
is a plus for selling, but the maintenance record is even more important.
Also, you might as well go for a more recent version if you can afford it
because of the improvements over the years.  Upgrading features on an older
car is possible but maybe more expensive than getting the newer one 
in the long run.

In the Northeast, there aren't many places that have multiple 928s for sale,
so it takes time to look around.  If you're in Florida or California there
are probably more to choose from.


Good luck!
