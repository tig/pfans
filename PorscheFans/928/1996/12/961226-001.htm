Hi John -

Can't remember if you were the one referring me to his book, "Bosche
Fuel Injection & Engine Management (How to Understand, Service and
Modify)" but I just got it for Christmas!  Starting to read on pulsed
systems ie. L-Jetronic!

Cool!
Phil

I also have a 1984 928 S with the same problem as you are describing, =
and
the cause seems to be the front seal.  Now, mine does not leak very bad =
and
I keep a close eye on it to ensure that the ATF level does not go below =
the
normal range. Suggest you let a mechanic take a look at it.

Good Luck
