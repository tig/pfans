On my '84 US with stock factory speakers, there isn't a speaker grill.
I just have holes in the vinyl/leather.

I don't even want to think about replacing the rear factory speakers.
(how would you get to them?)

I fully traced the maze of wiring in the '84 US stock setup.  I posted 
(but didn't save) a message to porschephiles...  The factory wiring diagrams
are correct and essential if you want to follow the wires and take out the
unnecessary stuff.

Couple points:  In the early cars (like my '84 US) the radio provides
only two powered channels out.  This either goes to the fader knob (driver's
side) or to the amp (passenger's side); can't remember exactly.  I think 
there's another set of wires that run from the fader knob, across the 
driver's seat, over the hump, to the amp. maybe.

Anyways, when I installed a new amplified head unit (Blaupunkt Tucson), 
I took out the old secondary amp, disconnected the fader knob and the small
harness connected to it.  I used the other existing harness from the radio 
to under the driver's seat.  There I found a connector for the front two 
door speakers.  Snapped them together, and it worked.  I had to run two 
pair from the head to the rear speaker connection point, ie the box on the
right of the passenger seat.
