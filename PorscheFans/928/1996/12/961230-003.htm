SCCook asks:

>> Has anyone used a dash cover kit available through mail order? <<

I've not used this BECAUSE I have seen them installed on 924/944 and in Performance 
Products' showroom. Most common product is named "CoverLay" for around $75.  I've seen 
ads for a much more expensive product ($135) which may be better, but have not seen the 
product and they didn't repond to my inquiry about 928.

>> Is it a thick vinyl? <<

No. The CoverLay is a molded styrene-type product - pretty thin. 

>> How is it installed? <<

To get a good install, you would have to peal off all the leather, then trim and fit 
the CoverLay product to the dash, maybe gluing it down. Problem area is the area near 
the windshield - space is tight here.  You may be able to get a better result by just 
removing the leather and cleaning off the adhesive.  Be sure to use a solvent that 
won't disolve the plastic/vinyl dash inderneath the leather.  3m makes a special 
solvent just for trim adhesive this is supposed to be safe for paint at least.  Test 
first.

>> How does it look? <<

I would prefer a carpetted dash cover to the CoverLay product.  I have seen three, and 
each looks cheesy.
