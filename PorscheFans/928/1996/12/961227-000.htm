Oh man, of course!  How could I have forgotten them - too excited
dreaming about MORE POWER!!!

On other notes, I just installed a new Denon head unit and was playing
around at full volume when *** the rear channels just disappeared!  They
were distorting like crazy then nothing.  Oh well, I still need to shop
for an amp, antennae & door speakers.  Heck maybe I'll exchange these
Polk coax's too and start all over.  At least the wire's pulled!  

I was going to put a tv in the glove box but no one wanted to help me at
Good Guy's tonight so I left.
