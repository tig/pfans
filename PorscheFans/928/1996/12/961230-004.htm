Benny Chong asks:

>> My dash is cracked from the leather shrinking over the years and I am considering 
sending them out to the above named outfit. They seem to do pretty good jobs on 
restoring dashes. <<

I agree.  I have visited their shop in LA and seen samples of their non-Porsche work 
(60s Cadillac, Chevy etc) much of which is way more complex than any Porsche dash.

>> My main concern is that once I remove the  dash how are they going to know how much 
gap there was between the pieces to remold the unit for a good fit? <<

I would recommend sending the glove box door along with the dash.  That is the only 
really critical opening.  Even that is not too critical.  The pod, however, is another 
story.  The six holes for the switches need enough clearance so the switch can turn 
freely without binding.  I'd suggest buying a junk shitch and sending it along if you 
are going to have the pod recovered.  BTW, I had my dash recovered with stiched vinyl 
by a local upholstry shop.  Result was outstanding, and about half the price quoted by 
Just Dashes.  I tried the same thing with the pod.  Apearance was good, but I neglected 
to have them enlarge the switch holes and the extra thickness of the vinyl made three 
of the switches bind.  I finally bought an uncracked used pod.
