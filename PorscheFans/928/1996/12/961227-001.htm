Well , my wife didn't surprise my with a 928S4 for Christmas so I've got to start 
looking again. She had one picked out for me in Indy, but I really couldn't get 
excited about it. Nothing in So. Florida hasn't panned out either. If anyone knows 
of a GREAT '89-91 S4 deal, please let me know.... The 911 is up for rebuild for next 
season, and I'm getting bored driving #2 son's Blazer (doesn't do too bad in the 
snow though-- not a good as my "old" Quattro). My oldest son brought the Quattro 
home for a couple of weeks from Alabama and I'd forgotten how much fun it is to 
throw around in the bad weather..

Back to the 928S4. Really I'm ready any time to get one. If anyone has any info on 
one for sale please let me know. I don't mind the travel, if the car is as 
represented and someone has checked it out for me. I called on one today up in 
Chicago--Anyone on the list interested in checking on it for me????? The colors 
didn't seem too great to me but it had all the equip I wanted. Since I'm looking to 
keep this one for the next 10-20 yrs, it has to be a car that REALLY want..

Thanks for hearing me out-- any help would be appreciated !!!
