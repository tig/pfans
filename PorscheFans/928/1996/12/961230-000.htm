Seriously?  Now that's overengineering!  The covers came off fairly easy
(weird speakers by ITT) - I'm gonna' take another look at them grills.  

Had fun sitting in the garage cranking the tunes and planning my sub
enclosure.  

Another item I forgot to mention regards the factory rear support for
the head unit.  This may interfere with a different head unit, depending
on depth of the new unit.  You might be able to bend it to fit (or make
a custom bracket).  It's important to support the head unit at the rear,
especially if a CD player, so don't be tempted to omit this brace!

Finally, the stock rectangular mounting for the radio may/may not fit
the slide lock(s) on a new head unit.  Mine didn't so I had to remove it
by pushing it back into the hole, then prying it out.  Note how the tabs
are bent, so you can copy it on the new mount.  On my car, only the
bottom tabs are used to hold onto the top of the plastic frame above the
ashtray (the top tabs just hit the bottom of the warning light
assembly).

I'm glad "phase I" of this install is done.  It was a big job!  The most
fun was creating an amp rack out of the tray.  I mounted a readily
accesible secondary fuse that's illuminated from above whenever the
amp's via a red LED to match the amp (my version of overengineering). 
Also on the tray is the RF crossover.  I pointed the glovebox a/c hose
to cool the amp.  My primary amp fuse is at the battery well (no pun
intended) within the 18" manufacturer recommendation.

Phase II will be the sub box, power antenna and final tuning.  It may
not win any sound-off contests, but sure looks/sounds good to me!

Thanks for the speaker tip Leonard - you've helped me out alot before. 
I am amazed at how well you know the 928!
Phil
