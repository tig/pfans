Hi all:

I found out the hard way that you do not need to remove the door skins
to change out the factory door speakers! Believe me, the abbreviated way
is alot less work:

1.  carefully pop off the stock speaker grills - use a rag underneath a
screwdriver or putty knife if you value your leather.

2.  pull the door release lever out a bit and remove the screw that
holds in the plastic release housing; remove housing.

3.  remove the leather panel that runs under the release lever.  It is
held in by two plastic standoffs opposite the lever pull, so just pull
the panel then lift up to remove.

4.  remove the black plastic caps inside the door pocket and
loosen/remove the nuts underneath.

5.  At this point you should be able to remove the armrest, leaving the
pocket in place.  Mine took a good upwards tug since it kinda' fused in
place over time.  Note the openings in the fiberboard allowing good
access to the inner door cavity!

6.  With the armrest, middle panel and factory speakers removed, you now
have a number of holes to fish cable through.  I doubled up my speaker
cable and fed it though the plastic tube just fine without a coat
hanger, etc.  That way I had two pairs in just one pull.

7.  A big caveat:  Make sure your new speakers aren't too deep - there
isn't much room behind for large magnets!  I ran into this problem and
pulled out the panel immediately surrounding the 4" to make room.  Not
very noticeable, just a slight gap between the window glass and the door
panel.  Planning on speaker spacers so I can pop the panel in flush
again.  Note if you choose to cut a hole in the sheetmetal instead, your
window might hit the speaker the magnet!!!

8.  I was unable to separate the old tweeter from it's plastic
housing.   You can make a custom mounting plate out of wood or plastic,
just cut out a circle the same size as the old tweeter and then drill
the four mounting holes.  It's your choice now whether to surface or
flush mount the new tweeter in your custom mounting plate. If you flush
mount, then you can use the old grill for a stealth install.

On rear seat speakers:

1.  the factory speaker housing is intended to go on one way only due to
the curves of the panel it mounts to.  

2.  you will have to glue the old grill back into the housing if you are
changing speakers or do some fancy mounting for new grills.  If the
former you may want to use black silicone sealer to cut down on
vibration buzzes.

3.  I found my Polk Audio 6 1/2's fit right into the stock cutout "sort
of".  The cut out is big enough, almost too big, so I only used two
screws to hold the speaker in place.  You may need to drill additional
mounting holes.  

4.  Reinstall factory grill, voila, stealth install!

5.  If you've made it this far, then you already know you cannot use the
factory wiring for your new stereo.    Trust me, I've tried following
the factory harness through all the connectors, color changes, fader,
amp, etc.  What a maze.  The wire is too thin anyways.  Do it right and
use new cable runs.

Aside:
The passenger side tray makes an ideal amp rack if yours fits.  You may
need to cut out portions of the rear.  It's only plastic lined with felt
so use a hacksaw if you need to.   Also, your amp can benefit if you
reroute the glove box a/c hose to the shelf area (my next step)!

Finally:
Anyone have a novel approach for sub mounting?  There's no way to get
good bass out of 4" or even the 6 1/2's"  so subs seem a necessity.  I
think a flat box on the passenger side of the cargo area takes up the
least room and still allows full access to the spare/battery/tools etc. 
Retains use of the spider webbing too.

All the tips I have so far - good luck and good sounds!
