     Hi Jeff,
     
     The last issue of Excellence has a complete rundown of all the details 
     on the 928.  I do not remember the month that the magazine came out, 
     but it should be at your better local magazine shops.  You should get 
     this issue!
     
     I too have an interest in these cars, but the aforementioned article 
     specifically noted that the European cars are statistically driven 
     harder in Europe.  If this car spent time in Europe prior to U.S. 
     entry, that may be true.
     
     Also, the conversion to U.S. specification (gray market cars) may not 
     be up to standards (Porsche standards) and could be a cause for 
     concern.  An experienced Porsche shop should comb this car very 
     carefully for you.
     
     The 310 hp is a nice bonus, as is the low miles, but I do not know how 
     you could document that those are the actual miles.  Does anyone know?
     
     Does this vehicle have a service record history?
     
     Marv (87 944 & 87 944S)

     I'm new to this list, although I've been on the 911 list for a while.  
     I'm
     interested in a 928 for a daily driver (about 8-10,000/yr.). 
     
     I've found an '84 Euro w/ 49,000 miles and 310 h.p.  Those of you 
     who've had
     experience w/ 928's - is the Euro model trouble?  More than the U.S. 
     models.
      Is the extra h.p. worth the difference?
     
     Opinions appreciated.
     
     Jeff
