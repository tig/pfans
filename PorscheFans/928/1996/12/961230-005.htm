Phil Tong asks:

>> What's the best way to remove the rubber knobs without damaging them? <<

Just pull straight out (towards you).  The knob will come off exposing the switch and 
it's bulb.

>> Can I get away with NOT removing the wheel to service the pod? <<

The wheel (and a bunch of other stuff) has to be removed to remove the pod.  With 
mirrors, small hands, maybe forceps and luck, you MIGHT be able to change instrument 
bulbs in the back of the instrument cluster, but not easily.  I would maybe ask some 
experienced 928 mechanic if it was even possible.  You may want to examine a junk 
cluster just to get a feel for which bulb, practice how to get it out etc.

On non-airbag 928s, pulling the steering wheel is easy.  All Porsche steering wheels 
are held onto the splined steering colume by a large bolt - 27mm as I recall for my '82 
928.  No puller is required to get it off.  Just pull of horn pad, unplugging the horn 
wire, unbolt and lift off the wheel. It's a 5 min job, even for me.
