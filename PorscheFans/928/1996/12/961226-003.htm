Hi 928 fans,

I was wondering if any of you out there have any words of advice =
removing the dash. I've been told by "Just Dashes" out in CA that one =
does not need to remove the windshield. This was a relief since I didn't =
want to pay for a new one. My dash is cracked from the leather shrinking =
over the years and I am considering sending them out to the above named =
outfit. They seem to do pretty good jobs on restoring dashes. My main =
concern is that once I remove the  dash how are they going to know how =
much gap there was between the pieces to remold the unit for a good fit?

Thanks in advance for any help.
