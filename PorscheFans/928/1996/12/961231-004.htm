Some of the differences in the '84 Euro are: higher compression (needs premium gas,
US models run on regular), different cam, lower (numerically higher) rear
end ratio. That last is a good thing; the US models have a 2.27, which
is strictly a cruise gear, in order to meet some fuel consumption regs.

Other than what was done to make it US-legal, there doesn't seem to be
any reason to think it would be more troublesome than a US model, at
least until you get to emissions testing. Bruce Anderson thinks it
should sell at a discount relative to US models, because of the potential
for regulatory hassles, especially in California.

Oh yeah, be sure the timing belt is good, failure would be fatal in this
car.
