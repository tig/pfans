When I first got my 1984 928S, auto trans, I had a leak similar to what
you described.  There were in fact two problems.  The seal at the torque
converter was immediately seen to be a problem.  After the work was
started, an additional seal internal to the automatic transmission was
found to be also bad.  

I can only relate the general info, since the work was performed by On
The Edge in Colorado Springs (they primarily do Porsche service).  The
entire repair cost was around $650, and would have been more labor
intensive (the other quote was $200 more) if the mechanic (Bill) didn't
know some shortcuts.  Seems you have to drop the rear end to do the
work, and he had some ways to cheat his away through it.

My opinion is that you should not wait to get the repair done.  The seal
thing can indicate other internal problems.  In my case, there were some
small amounts of scoring of rotating parts.  The mechanic suggested
polishing the parts instead of replacement.  The point is, this is a
good time to see what's going on inside the transmission, and maybe save
yourself a significantly more expensive repair.
