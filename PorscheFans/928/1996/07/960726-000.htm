Guys, I've got a general car question about a fix I made to my daily driver, an '88 Saab 9000 turbo.

The intake manifold is in two pieces, split across the intake plenums.  This is like the pre-85 928's where the intake plenums connect to the air distributor.

Each intake plenum is connected to the other side by a short rubber hose (~2" dia, 2" long).  The hose seals the two ends and the gap of less than 1cm.  These hoses are orange in color.  Anyway, they're cracked (vacuum leak).

When engine is cold it doesn't idle.  After the engine warms up, the pieces expand and he idle is smooth.

Saab wants ~$32 each for each segment (x 4)!  Trollhatten doesn't have 'em.

So, I bought a radiator hose, cut the proper lengths, and put it back together.

Now I'm worried that this won't hold up to big swings in vacuum/pressure, heat, and fuel vapors.  I don't care if the hose bursts - I just don't want it to disintegrate and go into the engine!

Does anyone know much about rubber hoses?  Will they stand up to the toture?  Any comments?
