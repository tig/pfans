Hi all,

I just recently subscribed to this list, and it sure seems quiet.  I 
thought I would lurk for a few days to get a feel for it, but I have yet 
to receive a message.  I was sure that if I asked a question on day one, 
that I would be told to "look it up in the archives, we've already beat 
that one to death".  So, I will introduce myself, see if anyone else is 
out there, and maybe start a thread or two.

My name is Troy Daniels.  I live in San Diego, CA.  I am a 31 year old 
Air Traffic Controller, that was recently married and got to keep the 
Porsche.  So far.  I own a 1987 928 S4.  It is venetian blue with new 
gray leather interior.  Since I plan on driving it daily and not 
trailering it to concours events, I removed the rear jump seats and 
installed a very trick (and expensive) leather covered, curved 
compartment that houses a 12" subwoofer and all the custom stereo 
components. It really turned out nice.  The car is an automatic with 
90,000 miles on it.  It runs like new.  Or, so the mechanics tell me.  It 
drips automatic transmission fluid at the rate of one or two drops per 
day on the garage floor.  Otherwise, no major leaks or problems.  It is 
completely stock except for the K&N air filter.

Now for my first attempt at starting some interaction with everyone.  I 
am considering adding a set of Autothority chips.  I have heard people 
say that, on the automatic S4 especially, they make a tremendous 
difference.   On the other hand, I have heard people say that they are a 
complete waste of money, and that you will not notice any increase.  
Autothority claims around a 10% increase in horsepower.

Does anyone have any experience or opinions on this subject?  If not, say 
hello anyway.  Let me know that there is someone else on this list.

Thanks in advance,

Troy
