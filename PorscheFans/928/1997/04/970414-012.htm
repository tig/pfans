Might detract a little but given the downward spiral of 928 prices, most
notably early cars, not a big deal.  I don't think the addition of the
sunroof affects the car much structurally.  I would miss the 'mailslot' if
it wasn't there...

A visit to your local sunroof installer is in order.  There are tons of
roofs nowadays - from manual canvas roofs to electric pop-open/slide backs.
You might want to try to adapt an aftermarket sunroof for an entirely
different car/truck even.  I am sure someone, somewhere in the world has
done what you're planning.  The key is going to be finding a competent shop
to do the install & wiring.

Good luck,
Phil
