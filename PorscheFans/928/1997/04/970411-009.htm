  I think the cost of ownership continues to be reflected by the
  original $45K-$60K cost of admission for these cars.  I've never 
  really figured a cost/year basis - I'd probably get too depressed.

  Yes. I had to deal with this issue since we originally had a car seat that 
  wouldn't fit in the back and my wife didn't take kindly to riding there 
  instead.  The Century 1000STE will fit in the back seat.  What I don't like 
  is the fact that there is quite a bit of play between the seat belt and the 
  car seat since the belts in the rear have attachment points which are 
  actually a few inches above the bottom seat cushion.  This prevents you from 
  really cinching down the seat belt to make it extremely tight against the car
  seat, but I don't consider it to be unsafe.
  
  Despite the above, the 928 sure is fun!
