Hellooo Down There ;)

I see you are another eagle-eyed 928 fan, finding my photo of Marc's car in
the Devek ad!  "NSTY 928" is their 6 liter, big-brake, full rollcage
assault vehicle.  I took that picture on the way to the dyno - and that was
the closest I ever got to his car in my '84 :)  at the tollbooth when we
had to stop to pay!  

The long story is I needed to establish a baseline on my car and it just so
happens that the Devek Performance Team was heading up to Superior Dyno in
Fairfield to check out my friend's recently blueprinted '85, as well as
their own S4 and GTS.  So I got to tag along too!  

Around 8:30am I hit the Bay Bridge feeling groovy so to speak, blame it on
coffee.  In lane number two, I spotted a white 928 just ahead a bit.  So I
nailed the throttle to catch up and maybe have some fun.  Hmm, there's
something unusual about that car - pretty wide tires, big ole single
exhaust, and what's in there a rollbar?  Then I saw the DEVEK sticker in
the rear window!   

Marc let me pull up alongside, we smiled and waved, then I played 'follow
that car'  the rest of the way!  My computer is adorned with taped-on
pictures of all the 928's that showed up that day - just about one from
every 'gen' - a Euro '78, my '84 928 S, Madison's '85 928 S, Bob's (?) '86
928 S, Marc's S4 and Susan's GTS! 

This is all kind of a lead-in to modifying your suspension geometry.  You
need a clear picture of what you want (and there's nothing wrong with
stock) or else you'll be buying tires more often and possibly fidgeting
with the steering on the straightaways.   I am intrigued on progressive
springs for the 928 - Jim's doing that install soon also.  I think we're
all getting ready to go racing sometime, somewhere !  (Buttonwillow?  Pony
Express?)

I'm glad I'm not the one showing up this friday with a new Mustang hahaha
<just joking pony fans>
