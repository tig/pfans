  I had a similar situation on my car.  A spare key I had made would fit
  the doors and ignition, but not the hatch.  I don't know whether that
  means the problem is with the key or the hatch.

If the rack is not leaking and the mechanic did not mention anything 
about leakage, why replace it?  A rebuild rack cost about $600.

My '83 928S has 198K on the odo.  Still has the factory rack.  Just my 
opinion.

Another wild guess.. Could it be that the rev limiter is cutting in/out 
sporatically?

>(wild guess) ignition coil(s)?  Can you verify that with

Have you visit your local Porsche dealer?
