Hi Richard, and welcome to the register!

Condolences on the unfortunate sale of the 911, but take heart in the fact
that the 928 is both a practical and great fun mode of transport! I have
owned my 1981 model for about a year now and uuse it as my sole form of
everyday transport and have never as yet found any reason to consider
changing it (Apart from when i see that gorgeous black S$ in town...) But I
digress. This winter we were struck by a few weeks of heavy snow in which
the car performed as well as one could expect with near-slick 245 P700Z's
on the back, though if you tend towards a lot of snow a spare set of wheels
with perhaps 205 snow tyres might be good. Cost per year probably depends
quite a lot on what you get; I would recommend as new a model as you can
stretch to (Ideally an S4!) simply because, as you will see from a lot of
the messages on this list, a lot of the expense involved in 928 ownership
comes from repairing the many many gizmos on board, and the newer your car
is the younger and less prone to breakage these gadgets will be! Sewrvicing
actually winds up being quite cheap due to the 12,000 mile intervals but do
be warned, the cars are very tough on tyres, brakes and jungle-juice,
hardly surprising with that much weight and such a glorious engine! Can you
fit child seats? I should imagine so; I frequently cart two adults in the
back of mine, admittedly the girls usually go in the back and it tends to
be for short journeys but for kids it shouldn't be a problem. Another point
in favour of our darling 928 (And there are so many!) with regards children
is that they are so damn safe! You have HUGE reserve of handling,
power and brakes to keep you out of trouble (Something you will be used to
from the 911!) but if the worst should happen there is an awful lot of
metalwork protecting your future generation!

Oh, and if drive a lot in the snow then the 928 also has something which as
an ex-911 owner you will never have experienced!
A heater that works!
(Very well, in fact.)

Good luck with the family, and I/ we hope to welcome you into the joys of
928 ownership!

Daron Townson.
