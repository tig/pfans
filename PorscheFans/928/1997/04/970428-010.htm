|  I have had VERY good experience with the Yoko A008-R on my '84 Supra,
|  although that experience has been in autocross conditions vs track 
|  conditions.   Their stickability factor is incredible and the sidewall
|  is stiff enough that steering response is very quick.

I believe you can get R1's from other sources but joining TEAM/TA is NO COST at
all and the tyres are then less than $150 each. I have no experience with Yoko
tyres but have tried Toyos (really suck!) and street tyres. NOTHING I have had
yet comes close to the sidewall stiffnes of the R1's which is needed for the
front tyres to give agility to the fronts weight. I am onto my second set of
R1's and am happy with them (depite being owned by Michelin [another story]).

I have heard good things about A008's but have no experience with them.

I beleive the number for TEAM T/A is 1-800 RACE BFG.

I have no affiliations just a happy customer.
