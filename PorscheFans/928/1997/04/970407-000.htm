Some would say the 928 didn't get 'GREAT' until the 32v engines arrived in
1985...

Hmm.  A normally aspirated 6 liter conversion gets you pretty close to this
already.  Also, there was a supercharged 928 making the rounds at
Buttonwillow.  Maybe the owner will see your post and reply with details?  


re: 928 tranny
I have heard the 928 manual transaxle was engineered with a 100% cushion,
therefore should be stout enough to handle 600hp.  This is assuming the
trans is in good mechanical condition and you are sensitive to how it
shifts (no powershifting please!).  I doubt the stock clutch would take too
many drag race starts though.

?  I think most of the V8 conversions keep the Porsche trans.  But, once
you price out the kit and the labor involved, you'll probably want to stay
with the factory engine instead.  Look at it this way, yes pumping up a 327
or 350 is easy.  Dropping in the 928 won't be.  Wouldn't you rather learn
about developing the Porsche V8, than shoehorning a Chevy in?

Renegade?  Ron Simpson Hybrids?

Of course!  I started down a similar path with my '84 (give me more
power!).  The realization finally came that I might as well kick off with
better car to begin with ie. S4 or better.  That gets you into 320 hp
range, as well as 165mph+ club.  Fast enough yet?  Those are stock figures
too!  

If you must play now, how about starting with headers as the
biggest-bang-for-the-buck at $500 ?  The install doesn't look any worse
than say a V8 Monza :)  You won't break the bank and you'll still retain
the all-round capabilities of the 928.

As you can see, I'm really trying to dissuade you from going down the
conversion path with your car.  If you happened upon a clapped out car for
cheap, hey that's a different story.  But you're talking about a nice,
running 928 S - keep the faith!  You might have more fun taking drivers/AX
schools AND buying a hyper-bike for speed thrills?
