|suspensions it also raises concerns of my own too. My inside front tires are
|wearing tremendously (yes, I enjoy driving) and am wondering if my camber
|settings are too negative. (Car is perfect original with 67,000 miles) I can
|see the top of the tires are tilted in, but was just wondering if anyone knew
|a good setting. (Spec. book says camber adjusting value and tolerance is -30'
|+10'.)  Is -30' as minimum negative as anyones tried? Also how to lower rear
|(large collar at bottom of shock?) (special tool?) Any input is appreciated.

It sounds like someone before you decided to remove some the the cars default
understeer. If you set the cars geometry (alignment) to the factory settings
you should not get significant wear on the insides. Have someone checkout the
complete alignment (including ride height!). This is something everyone ought
to do fairly frequently. All the cars geometry is adustable and as such has a
tendenecy to "change" over time.

BTW my fronts have *really* bad wear on the inside of my street tyres, but
then I have 1.8Deg. neg camber on the front ;-)

I can atest to the AUTOMOTION (aka Kims setup) springs. Although I lost nearly
an inch in ride height, the car grounds on less roads than it used to, which
is still a lot :-( . I have had about 6months experience with them and can
state that in autocrossing the springs reduce my times by 3-4 secs per minute!
This is *THE* best performance upgrade that is possible on the car.

(Stupid questions are questions that are never asked.)  I went for the 
microfiche merely because there is apparently a backlog of it 
throughout the country.  Besides, they're much cheaper.  Luckily for 
me, I managed to locate a big reader that also print out a hard copy 
for $20 from a local used office equipment company.  Believe me, you 
don't want a small reader.

By the way... HOW DO YOU SEARCH THE ARCHIVE FOLKS?
