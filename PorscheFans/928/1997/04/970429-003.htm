I copied this e-mail from the Mercedes list:

>	I called K&N and they sent me several interesting items.
>
>	1.  Statement from Automotive Filter Manufacturers Council, that says
>	that you Do Not have to use OEM Filters to meet your warranty, per
>	Moss-Magnuson Warranty Act, and that if Mercedes, or anybody else 
says
>	you do they have to provide the filter to you for free.  Interesting!
>
>	2.  Independent test from Motor Industry Research Assocition, that 
shows
>	K&N Filters meets the ISO 5011 Spec with an efficency of 99.28% (ISO 
is
>	the International Standards group, like ANSI is in the US)  
Interesting!
>
>	3.  A reprint from 1983 Car Craft test that said nice things.  
Expected,
>	but old article.
>
>	4.  A Catalog that list lots of car applications, including lots of
>	Mercedes.  Not expected, because of the extent of applications around
>	the world.
>
>	I also emailed their tech guy, and he said they have been in business
>	since 1962, and "K&N sells filters direct to OEM's such as
>	Harley-Davidson, Mopar Performance,Paxton supercharger co, Gale Banks
>	Engineering, Vortech Engineering, Stihl chainsaw co, Husquvarna, ATK
>	motorcycle co,Mikuni america, Rotax engineering, Anheuser-Busch,
>	Cerwin-Vega,Mcdonnell-Douglas, Polaris Industries,Powered by Ford. We
>	even have Ford dealerships set up to buy direct and that they do-in
>	quantity!" etc, etc, etc. 
>
>	K&N also has never heard of a Volvo test, that their filter is not
>	recommended, no good, etc, and offered incentive to individual(s) if
>	article could be provided.  No takers.
>
>	 Also said that the SAE minimum for efficency is 95%. Interesting!  I
>	wonder what Mercedes is?
>
>	I have no interest in K&N, don't sell, don't own, just don't do 
anything
>	other than look for a better way, if there is such a thing.  With the 
87
>	Vette, with no other change on daily commute, MPG went up 1.5.  I was
>	impressed!  Drove for 65K miles and still great perfornance, and no 
oil,
>	but very, very fast, and effficient.
>
>	On a road trips with 1995 SL500, at 75 mph, get 23 mpg, but that is 
what
>	it is suppost to be according to EPA.  I was getting 28.5 mpg on 
tweaked
>	(read Hot Rod) Vette at 75 mph, and no I did not drive with an egg 
under
>	the accelerator.  Good engineering, spell effenciency.
>
>	Mercedes is a great car, and I wanted to share my experience with 
you.  
>	If there is good info that says K&N  is not good, let me know, and I
>	will change in a flash.  But, if there is a better way!  Well?
