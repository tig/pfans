Anyone do a single disc clutch on late =9286 up.  Any tips would be good.=
=20
If anyone can better describe the purpose of the 2mm angle brackets in
the factory manual it=92d be really helpful.  Currently, I=92ve got the
exhaust and lower bell housing cover off and ready to go at the clutch.

Next job is the right rear wheel bearing.  Anyone been here?  Looks like
a ~30 mm axle nut that the manual says gets 220 ft-lbs is job #1.

I have fixed my seat switches - easy to do (but some tricks) and worth
it as replacements are $91.12 list each (2 per seat) for the =9287 and
later I believe.  I=92ll write it up this weekend hopefully.  I=92m also
doing the O2 sensor and I think it's a standard 3 wire that=92s under $60
(tonight=92s agenda).

Best,
Kurt

I was the one that responded with the "fuel filter" remark.  If I have 
offended anyone, I apologize.  I'm sure the person mis-typed.  I was in 
a funny mood at the time.  

Now, can someone tell me why does the 911s do not have an radiator?
