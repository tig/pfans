  Here's my $.02.  Of the tires you've listed, the D40M2 are probably 
  the best bet.  I know of someone who had them on a 944 Turbo and was
  very pleased.  The P7 is old technology and the P6000 doesn't appear
  to come in a 245/50(V or Z)-16 (according to Tire Rack's web site
  (http://www.tirerack.com)).
  
  I'm using Yoko AVS-Intermediates on my 928 as well as my wife's car, 
  and I've been very pleased with the performance - very sticky and the
  wet weather traction is fine for about the first 7K miles (starts to 
  degrade after that).  The Yoko A509 is a lesser performance tire that 
  looks very similar to the AVS-I (in fact, I have 4 A509s in my garage 
  waiting to be mounted  on my Supra), but doesn't have as soft of a tread 
  compound.  Looks like there is a $63/tire cost difference between the A509 
  and the AVS-I.
  
  Another good tire I had used on my 928 was the Bridgestone RE-71.  Overall,
  I felt that they were good tires but they seemed to get "hard" faster
  than the AVS-I which is why I switched.  The cost for the RE-71 probably
  falls between the D40M2 and the AVS-I.
  
  Of course, (I'll probably have to dodge a lot of flames after I say this)
  if the car is just for pleasure use, you could get great performance for
  a reasonable cost by going to a Yoko A-008R.  I would NEVER do that if
  you're only going to replace two, however, because the characteristics
  of that tire are unlike any "normal" high-perf tire.  I've been using them
  on my Supra for daily driving for two years now and, because of the 
  incredible fun factor, I can't stand to give them up (which is why the A509s 
  are still in the garage; used A-008Rs won't pass state inspection and I 
  know I'm going to ticketed for an out-of-date inspection sticker sooner
  or later ;) ).
  
  I'm sure you're going to get lots of advice from the rest of the group
  on this issue.

My '83 928S came with a factory Blaupunkt Montery radio.  It is dying 
on me.  I thought at one time, Porsche has an exchange program; you can 
trade in your old radio for a reconditioned one for about $100.  Now, 
my local Porsche dealer said that there was never such a program.  I'm 
confused.  Any comment?
