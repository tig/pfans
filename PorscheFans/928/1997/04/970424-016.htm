928 world that is...

Man has it been quiet.  I know some of us are still reeling over tax time
but hey, it's over for another year.

So I was reading that car mag that pitted seven supercars against each
other (all the time thinking what woulda' happened if Porsche continued the
928 to model year 1998).  Of course the Porsche Twin Turbo/all wheel drive
kicked butt most of the time, but surprised at the number of test wins the
Viper logged, and even more the new Vette lost (it won't be running away
from any S4's).

So what do you all think?  The Viper posted sub-4 second 0-60, in excess of
1.0G's (345's sure help alot) and top end of 183mph (going off memory). 
Not even the flagship TT could catch it.  How would a 'current' 928 compare
given those numbers?  Would Porsche even let it's performance surpass the
TT?  Would they have made a 6 liter the stock engine by now?

Let your imagination roam!
