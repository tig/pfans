Kurt, I think you have been mislead by the factory book.  When the belt
was off, I had to move some wire which required that I remove the 
cam drive pulley.  The rotor is connected dirrectly to the camshaft
but the pulley is not (it can move back and forth maybe 10 degree).

Because of this, it is possible to change the cam's timing relative to 
the crankshaft thus changing when the spark sill occur relative to
the piston position.  Is is meant to be change, probably not as it would
be a complicated procedure.  But it is certainly possible.

In my case, i am a little anxious to see how the engine will run as I
might have change that setting during my procedure.
