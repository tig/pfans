     Hi Everyone,
     
     I noted the discussion on the Technical Dimensions type of air filter. 
     I, like some others, would like to use this design of filter.  I had 
     that type on my Paxton supercharged 87 Vette.  Works good.  
     
     I think the reason that they don't offer a 928 application is because 
     of the need for filtered air for the PCV operation and the need for 
     cool incoming air to the induction system.  The temperature at the 
     rear of the motor (where the  conical filter would be, is very hot and 
     that is why those crafty engineers in Germany ducted the induction 
     system in the manner they have. 
     
     If anyone has any other take on this, please let the gang know. 
     
     Thanks,
     
     Don Vellenga

My '83 928S have 198K on the odo and the exterior has its share of 
repainting.  The interior is in execellent condition except the cracked 
dash.  I prefer to purchase another 928, but my wife is a very 
sentimental person and loved the car; she's the one that suggested that 
I should do some restoration work on it.  Currently, the color is 
hellbronze (light bronze) and I plan to keep it as such.  I've had some 
body/repaint experience before but its been awhile.  Last week I went 
to the local auto paint supply house and spoke to one of their sales 
people.  Paint technology has improved dramatically the past decade.  
He recommend the Dupont line; acrylic enamel.  Originally Porsche uses 
Glasurit but the formulation of Glasurit paint here in the U.S. is 
different than in Europe; this is done to comply with EPA requirements. 
 The cost of the paint and miscellaneous supplies will be about $300 to 
repaint the 928.  This is far below the price of $3,500 from a local 
shop.  The quality should equal or exceed the factory paint job.  (This 
of course, depends on the body preparation.)  I'm in the process of 
striping all trim items and preping the body right now.  I'm doing this 
in my spare time so hopefully I will start painting in about a month.

Sounds like you'll be busy for awhile.  But I'm sure the efforts will 
be very rewarding at the end.
