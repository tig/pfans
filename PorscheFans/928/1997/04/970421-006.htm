Piece of cake.

I used a footswitch from a guitar effect. There are other appliances, such as
sewing machines or dictation recorders, that use momentary contact push button
footswitches. You _could_ just go to Radio Shak [sic] and get a tiny project
box and momentary pushbutton and mount your button in that box. Get some zip
cord.  Give yourself a few feet of zip cord to work with. Solder a connector
of the footswitch to one side of the zip cord and the other connector to the
other side of the zip cord.

Unplug the connector at the kickdown switch. Its a female end which accepts
the two prongs of the switch. I found two bolts which had the correct outer
diameter (same size as the prongs of the switch) and wrapped a piece of zip
cord wire around the heads of each bolt and then shrink-wrapped them. 
Electrical tape will do. Just make sure that the heads of the bolts don't
contact each other. The bolts I used had very tiny heads. You could hacksaw 
off the heads if you were concerned about interference. Slide these bolts into
the female connector and doublecheck that everything is well insulated from
contacting anything else.

There you have it. The button under the gas pedal is now defunct. Your new
footswitch has taken its place and is convienently positioned on the left
kickpanel. I used velcro. Nothing is permenantly altered. In a pinch, all could
be reverted to stock.
