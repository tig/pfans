Hi again!

I've been reading with interest the discourse concerning the fiiting of a
secon kickdown switch along with the existing one and would like to add my
thoughts to the equation.

Firstly, the kickdown is great but am I missing the point? I generally use
the selector lever to hold-down a gear or two just before overtaking; same
idea, different execution. I suppose the only disadvantage of this is that
if the change right down to first gear is marginal I'll leave that final
jump to the kickdown; if the gearbox is happy that the revs. will cope then
who am I to argue, I'd just rather not dump it into first and risk
over-revving my engine...!

....which brings me to a secondary switch for a manual over-ride of the
kick-down. Would it be possible to wire this in parralel to the existing
switch but use a more conventional momentary/ locking switch mounted within
easy reach, perhaps even mounted on the steering wheel? This way you could
100 percent safely jump-down to your ideal gear a second before the world
erupts (They really do accelerate don't they!) without the unfortunate
pause from the transmission. Now if you could control the hold into first,
second, third and (where appropriate) fourth with wheel mounted switches;
now that would be cool! Your very own Tiptronic S! Still, one thing at a
time. Any further thoughts, guys? I think I might give it a try but would
love feedback from anyone who has already done it!

TIA,
