G'day guys, hi Phil!

Ahhh... now I know where you are coming from. Nice wheels! (Though I have
never actually seen them on any 911 but maybe that is more a foible of our
UK models.) Are they 16's or 17's? (8 and 9 inch widths I presume?) I agree
on your thoughts regards the 16V cars; I am still uncertain as to whether I
prefer the "Shark" nosed front of the 16V models or the "Aero" look which
followed, I suppose it just depends what mood I'm in!

Just checked my lil' books and you are (As usually seems the case!)
correct. Apparently the UK got two Club-Sport based models; the Club Sport
proper (201lbs lighter, hotter cams, ignition and injection and a raised
redline at 6775). This model is by all accounts as rare as the proverbial
rocking horse poop in the UK, I don't know how many exactly but they are
RARE! The other, SLIGHTLY more common version was UK specific and called
the "SE", basically the Club Sport running gear with S4 bells and whistles.
Pointless? Yup! One interesting point though is that the non-UK GT model's
equipment list was closer to that of the CS while the UK GT is spec'ed as
per the S4 so it looks like you guys got the good 'uns!

As for engine specifics on the CS officially the figures were the same as
the S4 though I suspect this was more to do with teutonic modesty than
real-world figures; as I say the engine got hotter cams, injection and
ignition as well as a raised redline and according to everything I've read
(Oh how I wish I could give you my personal opinion!!) the car felt a lot
faster... to quote Colin Chapman:"To increase speed, add lightness."

As for the GTS's suspension reverting to softer settings than the GT you
may be right; perhaps they went for something like the settings for the UK
GT? Who knows but by all accounts the GTS is still a little harsh riding.
Of course the person to ask is Adam King; what do you think, Adam? Any
thoughts on the suspension of your GTS? As for the flared arches; please
excuse me while I swoon girlishly at the mere thought of them!

>How about some nice tuned 928 headers to go?

Do you mean the Devek ones? Hmmm.... ok, so how much are they and what sort
of gains are we talking about? I'd love to give Ol'Sharky a boost but it
strikes me that there are a lot of areas where one can spend a LOT of money
with negligible results. What do you suggest? K&N? Headers? Electronics?
Advice (and charitible donations!) gratefully recieved! It's strange how
300 angry horses once seemed excessive...


Final word (No doubt to sighs of relief! Sorry, I do tend to go on a bit!)
is to recommend you all to try and track-down issue No. 41 (April 97) of
"911 and Porsche World" magazine which has a 20th anniversary retrospective
on the 928; could be longer but you've got to take what you can
get...anyway worth a look.

928; Loved by those for whom "Too much" is just barely enough.
