Will there be a physical difference between the air being pushed of
pulled??  I would not thing so but the easiest way to check would be
to compare the fuel management control between a Non-turbo Porsche
model and its Turbo version.

  If they use the same metering device, maybe with different setting, 
then the putting the ram air is just a question of adjusting the
FI.

Also, isn't there a supercharged 928 around?  What type of fuel 
management does it use?

The fuel filter for the automatic transmission can be found next to the 
coolant filter by the muffler bearing.
