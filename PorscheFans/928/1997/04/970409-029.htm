Welcome to the best list on the net, featuring the best road car Porsche
ever made - the 928!

> 
> Can I get a nice 1987 928 S4 for under $15K?

You probably wouldn't want it (too rough / undocumented / etc.) although
the automatic cars are beginning to approach this price.  You will soon
hear / learn to "stick" to finding (32v) manual trans cars as the holy
grail of true 928 performance driving / pleasure - but for everyday GT
touring the auto's are perfect (yes I have an auto car too).  I found out
the automatics are ideal for bracket racing too!

?  Haven't heard of any major things.  Maybe non-functioning electric grill
flaps?  (have you studied about the 928's yet?  you should before you buy).
 Recent water pump & t-belt change?  Everything else work?  CC?  Get a
mechanical check by a reputable 928 shop - hard data like
compression/leak-down/etc. and not foo-foo ie. wrong radio for year, blah
blah.   FWIW I hope the car has the luggage cover - those things are rare
to find in good condition and $1000 from Porsche!

> If there is an archive or a FAQ on buying a 928, please let me know.
> 

I think the 928 porschefans archives are the most extensive (if not the
only archive on the 928).  You'll find option codes, Vin codes and more to
help you through the buying search.  But there are plenty of 'porsche'
sites throughout the world, just a matter of going through each one (aren't
you glad you don't pay for connect time)

Good luck on the hunt!
