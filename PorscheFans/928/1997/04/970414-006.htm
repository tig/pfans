You have a 16-valve engine, right? If so it's the same as the '84 and
your friend is right. The US car uses a WR8DS, slightly hotter, silver
tip. (The higher the number, the hotter the plug, at least for Bosch.)
If you really like platinum tips use WR7DP.

Hot spark is good, but the heat-range of a spark plug is something
else. It measures the rate at which heat is conducted away from
the center electrode, which is mainly dependent on the length of
the center insulator. Too hot a plug and you get preignition; too
cold and you get fouling.

Incidentally, do you have a sticker under the hood with emissions
information? US cars do, and among other things it identifies
the recommended plugs.
