I've experience with an M3 in Australia - we got a decent (10% or so) horsepower-at-the-rear-wheel increase from a chip.  It needed an air box change to get the chip to work.  The increase came with extra revs and didn't sacrifice torque or driveability in bottom of the rev range.  You really won't get much extra torque and you won't feel a thing unless you use the power band.  The M3 had no rev limiter (our choice...) and would spin in fourth to 7400 rpm (this was a 2.8 litre engine with a 6 speed Getrag box) and the calculation on the gearing meant that the straight through fifth gear was too tall and the tall timber sixth was open highways only.  I think that if your engine ever sees the high side of 7000rpm, you'll be up for more than a timing belt.  The M3 engine was balanced and blued with hand shaped plastic intakes.  And yes, I loved listening to it with no catalytic converters and one resonance chamber.


I've heard tell that a chip without changing the air box to match can be a mistake.  Also US fuel Octane ratings are pretty dismal, but the S4 engine is a sweet gem of machinery when it's 'on song'.  Bottom line is, you'd be spending thousands to get any more horses out of that V8 by any means other than the chip.  If you mail order it, be very sure about the need for (and effect of) changing the air box.  You might also change the back pressure by changing the exhaust work after the cats.  You really need to follow someone else whose already got the formula right.  If you're changing the chip, doing the intake and exhaust gas flow at the same time makes sense.  Of course, the S4 with an open exhaust does sound awesome beyond belief.


BTW, we couldn't get the M3 to run properly (terribly resonance flat spot) until we did the air flow, put in the new air box and changed the air flow meter.  Of course, the M3 engine was already pretty highly strung -- unlike the US equivalent.
