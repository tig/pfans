Jeez that's a bargain!  Here's what chaps my hide - last year I bought a
handful of Churchills for $13.50 EACH - I didn't know the market price. 
Then I got this lovely mail order catalog from Thompson and saw their price
was under $4 !   I understand retail overhead due to vendor #1's location
but triple mail-order is a rip-off!   

Needless to say, I don't frequent that smoke shop very often.  When I do
it's only to pick up another favorite, unknown smoke - the Casillas, their
price $4.00, don't know of any alternate source.  The Casillas is a
relatively sweet smoke, with a chocolate like tone.  Properly humidified,
they have a squish just like a Cohiba!

When the Porsche Fans get together for microbrew night, the cutters,
Colibris and pocket humidors all come out of the woodwork!  (whew I thought
I might not make the connection to the thread!)
