Have you thought about sending the chips to Autothority and letting them
verify that the software is / is not corrupt?  It shouldn't make even a
little bit of difference that they were "old" (1990), as the information in
them has no shelf life and the chips do not lose information with time, only
with ultraviolet light.  The chip programs have no versions that would make
your old ones out of date, only versions to accomodate the cars electronics.

Just a thought.  You might save yourself a significant amount of money
returning the new chips and having them fix the old ones.
