My wires are brand new.  This was probably one of the only good thing
the PO did to this car.  Probably did not find a way around buying BERU
wires...

I actually never spent a dime in the place.  But I went there twice to
look
for a Porsche, and one in an open house, all bad experience.  I guess I
am a
sucker for bad service...

Let me explain.  On my car, there is a wiring harness that connect to
the
positive terminal on the passenger fender.  The wires goes in front of
the
engine and down to the oil pressure gauge, alternator and other misc.
component
(something like 10 or 12 wires).  In my car, this harness is in the way
of my right
side snorkel and it prevent connecting the snorkel to the timing belt
cover.

So, this is where I went wrong.  I thought that the harness should be
located behind
the timing belt housing in a similar fashion as the wires going to the
alternator.
The only way to place the wires in that position is to remove the cam
gear and rotate
the rear T-Belt housing cover.  Well, the cam gear does not have a
"woodruf"(?) key
and is only held in position with 3 screws that let you adjust the gear
position with
+- 5 degree or so.  My problem is that I did not mark the position of
the gear before I
removed it.  When I put it back on, it was kind of a guess to put it
exactly where it
was before.  My mechanics tells me that I was close but I am a little
off.

The only way of adjusting the timming is to take the t-belt off and the
valve
cover off, put the car a #6 TDC and measure the cam position.  You can
then set
the cam gear.

Well, I am not going to track the car this year and I will keep it this
way until
I need to get the belt retension.  At this point, I will get my mechanic
to take the 
belt off and fix the timing.

I only changed the pad and rotors on the rear (I bought ne pad for the 
front but opted to leave the old on on as they had more meat on them
then
I expected, Was this a lucky move??).  The 4 wheels were experiencing
the same
lockup, even the front one that was not taken apart.

The brake were bled with almost a full liter of new fluid.  I will need
to 
do some more bleeding as the fluid is still not very clean...

My next step is to adjust the brake pedal.  Hopefully, this is the
source
of my problem.

Yes, I first put all the bolts on by hand using the star pattern
followed
by torquing them in 2 step using a torque wrench.
