Yesterday, I was reading messages from the list and noticed someone =
suggested using Formula 409 as a cleaner for the leather seats.  At the =
time, I didn't think about it and just went on.  But last night while my =
fiance was cleaning the leather I happened to mention 409 was suggested. =
 She went ballistic on me.  She is a chemist and knows what the =
chemicals do.  She read to me what was in 409 and said, "See, don't use =
it."  I looked at her funny since I had no idea what any of the =
chemicals meant.  She then explained it like this, "409 is used to cut =
grease and oil, leather is cow skin, skin needs oil to keep it soft and =
supple, if you use 409 or Windex or other cleaners not meant for porous =
materials you will damage them over time by removing the oils it needs." =
 So, the moral of the story is don't use Formula 409 or other cleaner =
not meant for leather.
