Greetings,


I recently replaced the Blau in my '89 928 with my Sony DAT player, 
I made a custome cable to interface to the 928's existing amp and
speakers. Sounds good enough for what I want to spend. In any case I'm
curious about the antenna system on the 89s. Are they diversity based? It
would appear there are two antennas, one on the roof, and one in the front
windshield. My radio reception, both AM and FM is lousy, and the only
guess I can make is that the two antennas are fed into an amp, or
something that needs power and isn't getting it.


Any help is greatly appreciated.


TIA<

Lance

Cruising along on my 928S restoration until I tried to remove the 
right-hand mirror.  The hex bolt that is used to mount the mirror to 
the door is frozen.  I'm close to stripping the head in an attempt to 
remove it.  In short of hacking the mirror off with an ax, is there 
another humane way of removing it?  Can I just forget the mirrors?  I 
mean, when you're in an 928, what's behind or next to you doesn't 
matter right?   I'm seeking words of wisdom from you all.  :-)
