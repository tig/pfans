SwitchCraft

Yes, I was thinking the same thing, but there's a problem with that. Read on.

I removed the "dead" pedal and found 2 computer systems in there. Don't go in
there, man!

Yes! 

> In other words, can

Yes, but the compression braking isn't all that helpful. Not sure why. It
doesn't feel like a TH400.

Throttle not needed.
