>Take me off this fucking list

Since you knew enough to cc: your unpleasant message to the list in
question, you must have put yourself on the list. Since something seems to
be blocking your memory (as well as your manners, let alone your sense,
since I certainly did not put you on the list), point such browser as AOL
provides to http://www.porschefans.com and follow the (generally regarded
as) simple instructions.

>I don't even have a porsche

Or a shift key, it would seem. As to not having a Porsche, do us all (and
the cars) a favor and keep it that way. Stick to the BMW which West
Virginia University apparently issues to all its own.

Now go away.
