        I'm just about to buy a 1978 Porsche 928 VIN-9288200419  and I
wanted to know how many 928 were made in 1978 as well were they up for sale
in Jan of 78 or some time later in that year?  As well how many were 5 spd
like this one, and did any have limited slip diferentials in the first year?
Also does anyone know of faults that were problems for that year?  Does
anyone have any predictions if these early ones are becoming collectable?


                                                        Thanks A Lot...
                                                               James Renfrew
