Don, This could be a good thing to put into the FAQ this group is 
trying to build.  

Once I am done with my timming belt job, I planned to write down
the procedure so it can be included.

PS.  I do not have a website of my own but I do have some
free time and hard disk space.  If people want me to collect the
information for the FAQ, just send it my way and I will try to 
put it in a similar fashion as the 944 FAQ.
