There is a box called the Central Warning Unit, aka the Central
Informer, that runs all those lights. It's located under the
driver's left footrest (left side, that is) in a U. S. car.
Probably the same spot, renamed the bulge that intrudes on the
passenger's foot space, in the U. K. First thing to try would
be to just plug that in and out a few times, see if it makes
any difference. Let us know if it does (or doesn't).
