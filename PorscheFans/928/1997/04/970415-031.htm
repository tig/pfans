   Don't just use moly!  The lubricant used on the short drive-shaft 
splines and the interface between the guide tube and the release bearing 
is most definitely not just moly grease.  I ordered this lubricant 
through the parts department at my local dealer.  You can use lithium 
grease(according to dealer) for the "Solid white paste" called for on 
the bearing surface(recess) the clutch slave cylinder acutating rod 
rests in. 

  One other consideration.  While you have this assembly out, you may 
want to consider upgrading the guide sleeve, release bearing, and 
release arm.  I recently did this for my '89 because a chattering 
started to emanate from the clutch housing.  The problem, as outlined in 
a Porsche Tech Bulletin, are "unfavorable tolerance" between these 
parts.  The chatter appears to develop in the "clearance" between the 
guide sleeve and the release bearing when the Optimoly lubricant starts 
to dry up.  The natural engine vibration causes these two to "chatter" 
against each other.  The revised bearing and guide sleeve now have a 
SLIDING fit interface with no lubrication required.  If your car didn't 
have this problem before, it may never develop , but then again....  The 
upgraded release arm enhances clutch engagement.  The three must the 
used together.  The only stumbling block here maybe the price of the 
release bearing, which is about $218(Devek). The dealer sells it for 
about $275.  

  The updated parts are:

    a) Release bearing-     928 116 085 08
    b) Release bearing arm- 928 116 832 09
    c) Guide sleeve-        928 116 087 16
    
   If you'd like i can also fax the tech bulletins to you.

    Good luck,
