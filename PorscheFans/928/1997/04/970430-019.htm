Hello Gang,

Chris Trask's question about instrument lights has reminded me of another
on-going foible of my car, namely the fact that on initially turning on the
ignition the various warning lights do NOT illuminate to indicate that
everything is functioning. The strangest thing is that about a month ago,
completely out of the blue one day I turned the key and bam! There they all
were in their technicolour glory (and what a sight it was!) The only
trouble was three days later they had all ceased to function again. Now the
good news is that the actual lights themselves work fine in terms of
warnings etc, the problem seems to be in the initial "Test" phase,

I suspect probably a loose connection or bad contact but as I as yet have
not managed to track down a full set of manuals I have no idea where to
start looking! I don't suppose somebody could take a look at the wiring
diagram and give me an idea where to start? How about you, John (White)?
You appear to have a far better grasp of tthe eccentricities of our cars'
electrical systems than most; any ideas as to where I am best to start
looking?

Thanks a lot for any help you can offer on this,

All the best,

Daron Townson
