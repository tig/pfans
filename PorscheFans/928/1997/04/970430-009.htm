Chris,
  
     Before you start taking the dash pod apart, check the rheostat used
     for controlling the instrument cluster brightness.  This is located
     under the pod on the far right or left side.  My car has a very narrow
     range of adjustment, and if I turn the rheostat too far one way or
     the other (i.e. dim or bright) the whole instrument cluster goes black
     instead of changing brightness in a linear fashion.  I probably just
     need to clean this part and that may be your problem as well.  I
     think you can get to it from underneath without pulling apart the pod,
     but I haven't checked the manuals to be sure.

  Aside from going to the dealer or mailing off to a place like 928 Int'l,
  call the biggest locksmith shop in town.  That's what I did (Cothran's 
  Safe & Lock in Austin) and they cut one for me.  Just make sure you
  try the new key in the doors, ignition AND the hatch - my new one wouldn't
  open the hatch.
