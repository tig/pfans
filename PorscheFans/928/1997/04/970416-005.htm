Can't answer for Paul, but I figure it's a foregone conclusion that they're
gonna do this thing.

He asked how to win, not for my moral judgement, and he got a straight answer.

I don't have the concerns many of you do about street racing. There are
quite a few places that are reasonably safe to drive fast--maybe not at
10/10ths, but certainly at 8/10ths.  One of them is the street I live
on--the infamous Mulholland Drive.

I have owned Porsches (mainly 911s) for 26 years, have driven on track and
autocrossed and have never done 10 cents worth of damage to any innocent
party--nor to my cars. Can't say the same for some who have tried to follow
me through corners...

I'm big on personal responsibility. If I take the risk, I'll take the
consequences. I expect others to behave similarly.

Just my viewpoint. So sue me :-)

Bill Kelley
