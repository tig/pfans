Well, I am also confused.  The engine has already been turned by hand a
few time so I think I got it right but I am positive that the adjustment

If you have the service manual, go to page 15-132. They explain how to
adjust the camshaft setting.  I am not sure what the effect
of being slightly off would be.  I will consult my mechanic before
firing the engine.  More delays :-(

If you, or anyone else, has any suggestion, please let me know.
