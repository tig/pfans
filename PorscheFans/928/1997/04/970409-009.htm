In addition to Porsche Club Racing and Time Trials(944 and 912), I also have=
 a 
GT350 and track it with the Shelby Club.   We have an event on May 3&4 and I=
'd 
like to extend an invitation to any Porschefans who would like lotsa track 
time to join our Open Track and Annual Drivers School event May 3&4 at 
Thunderhill.  This is a low key, big fun type of event. 
 
We usually have 3 run groups, with the students together in one group.  This=
 
gives non students plenty of track time and we have a great Doo Dah party on=
 
Saturday night.  The mix of cars at our events crosses all marques from Shel=
by 
cars, Fords, Ferraris, Corvettes, Porsches, early British, Italian and the 
occasional Lola.   
 
The drivers school is open to anyone driving virtually anything with 4 wheel=
s 
and fenders that passes basic tech.   Whether your engine is in the front, 
back or middle, we have instructors that can get you safely around the track=
..  
Instructors are also on hand to coach experienced drivers as well..... 
 
Please go to our web site at www.norcal-saac.org for additional info and 
applications. 
 
Thanks, 
 
Hope to see you there......Ted
