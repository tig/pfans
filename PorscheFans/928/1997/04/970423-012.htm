>>
My opinion is that the stock pads are fine for the street but not for
the track. I replaced my stock pads (big-time fade on the track) with
Performance Friction Carbon Metallics, 80 compound, which work well
on both street (cold) and track (hot). They grip a little better
when hot, but the change isn't big enough to have made me nervous
in either condition. The one knock against them is that they lack the
clips that go into the pistons on the front set, and because of that
(I think), they rattle. I really have to get some of the sticky
stuff that glues them to the piston; hope that will remove the
rattle. Also, I think that any track pad will squeak a bit, sometimes.
If you're real touchy about that you have to go with street-only
pads.
