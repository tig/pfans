Good luck finding ANYONE who would part with their luggage cover!  Heard it
is a $900 replacement part from Porsche.  I think World Upholstery can redo
your old cover for $250.  

The key piece for those missing the whole sheebang is the retracting rod. 
With that, one could probably fashion their own cover, or so I've been
told.  I won't blow ____'s cover as the 'unknown' fabricator,  lest ___'s
email runneth over with tons of requests ( 'person' owes me a beer now for
this friday  :)
