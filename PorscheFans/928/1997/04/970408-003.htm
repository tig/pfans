....also, the basic 928 engine has far more potential than a basic chevy V8.
To me the thought of swapping out the 928 engine for a chevy is ludicrous.

basic U.S. 928 engine = 4.5 liter or 4.7 liter (273 cu.in.)
basic chevy V8 = ?  same year equivalent?  305 cu.in. or fairly anemic 350
- thanks but no thanks.

To include the 300hp euro 928 motor would be cheating I guess.  Let's make
sure we're comparing apples to apples as much as we can, otherwise this
won't make any sense and the skies the limit (6 liter supercharged 928's
vs. NOS'd 383 small-blocks!)(Smog controls? We don't need no stinking smog
controls!).

Yo, Phil:

No, using the 300hp euro/CIS motor would NOT be cheating.  I'm simply
comparing what is REASONABLY possible with a 305 Chevy... Assuming:
        1) The kind of assembly that both Porsche & competent aftermarket
                build-up implies
        2) Balanced crank, reasonably strong & lightweight rods & pistons
        3) Lightweight valvetrain
        4) Sensitively ported heads
        5) Appropriate carburetion with well-designed intake & exhaust manifolds

All told, this makes a 305 Chevy a roughly 265-300HP (SAE net, as per
Porsche's own HP claims) match for the 288HP of my '86 32valve 4-cam engine.
Will it last as long as a 928 engine?  Depends: 928 belts & inability to
overbore the Nikasil liners vs. the Chevy's maintenance-intensive
valvetrain.  One thing's for sure, the cost to run the Chevy 200,000 miles,
including initial cost & rebuilds, will be a fraction of the 928 engine.
Certainly, the total "$/HP/Mile" will be less.  Want 350/400+ hp?  Both
engines will do it, at substantial costs in longevity & drivability, but I
haven't speculated through this comparison.  As I noted in my previous post,
at these power levels you begin overriding the ability of streetable
suspensions, brakes & tires to actually deliver the goods, so the greater
gains come from "simplifying & adding lightness."

By the Bye, while Ed Ruiz's "ludicrous" doesn't hold IF YOU JUST COMPARE THE
ENGINES, it certainly holds if you consider how much of the 928's special
qualities (balance, traction, systems integration, etc.) would be lost in
even the most sensitive engine swap.

Phinally, Philip, WE need stinking smog controls or the cost of our private
fun becomes too high to justify publicly.  Sorta like military fighter jets:
cool machines, but you've got to be prepared to kill people to keep flying.
