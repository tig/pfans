I agree that the wire in place is sufficient, the question is how
over-sufficient is it? On a Chevy, it would be just big enough;
on a small-production car like a 928, it may be larger than
necessary, for the sake of simplicity. The four wires in question
are at M1, M2, M3, and M4 at the bottom of the relay panel in my
car; wire colors are white-blck, white, yellow-black, and yellow,
respectively. Just because I have a Ph.D. in EE doesn't mean that
I have a clue as to whether they can carry twice their 
intended current, though.
