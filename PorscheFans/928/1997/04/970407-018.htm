I think an early 300hp Euro version would do the trick. You could even take 
the windows out of the doors. You could probably get it even lower than 2800. 
An empty shell with a fiberglass seat, a 300hp motor, and some fat rubber on 
light rims! Sounds good to me! The stock suspension & brakes would be perfect 
for a car that weight! How much is an interior thrashed early euro worth? Or 
even better yet, a fire or flood victim S4! Although now that we have gone 
this far, I have seen some 914's with chevy power. Can you say 400hp and 
1800lbs?

Just my buck -three-ninety-five worth.

Jim 88 S4 (not ready to strip......yet)
