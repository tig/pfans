        To anyone who can please help ME!  Yesterday I was removing the
console from my 1978 928 and before I looked at the vacume hoses, to write
the assighnemt going into the contoller, I pulled it back about 2" and
looked at the back and found them all but one to allready be off,
AHHHHHHHHH!  There is 11 holes going into the controler, and I have fiddled
around all night right till now 1:00 am.  I'm horribly helpless and don't
know where any go, can anyone please look this up for me?  I if it is
possible tell me the assighnent in this order.  There are 3 vacume switches,
each is identified by a letter A,B and C at the right hand side of the
console in the rubber.  As well each hole has numbers at the base identifing
it, along with two vacume jumpers going from switch C(the top switch) to
switch A(the bottom switch).  Can someone please set me straight or even
just a rough look of where the different colours go?!
