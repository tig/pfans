There is this guy at work with a new 97' Targe who won't stop bugging me to
race my 85 Euro against him. I finally told him I would next month, and we
set a date at work, and even the boss will come out to watch from his
helicopter!

We will run on a 4 mile long section of two lane (coming, going) well paved
road (extremely sparse traffic, if any, it runs along a set of
office/corporate campuses that no one goes by on weekends) . There are some
formidable twisties broken up by 2 one mile straight-aways. What can I
expect, what is my car's weakness, where are his, my strenghts, etc. I know
he has a lot of new technology on his side, breaks, limited slip, traction
control, etc. I'm a better driver though, I know that, I wouldn't be
surprised if he lost control and crashed (some people can barely drive
safely in traffic and they attempt racing a car like the 911)

My car is stock except for a 3" Borla XR-1 exhaust, and it has recently
been given a major tune-up and is running as well as ever. I'm running 18"
technology wheels with Bridgestone S02s.

Any tips, I can't let this guy win, he's too damn cocky (you know the type)!

Paul
