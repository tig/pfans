I recently took my 928 into my mechanic for its annual checkup and=20
maintenance. I mentioned that there appeared to be a slight oil leak=20
somewhere. After examining the car the mechanic reported that one of=20
the head gaskets was leaking and that the other could probably stand=20
replacement as well. He didn't actually recommend replacement, but=20
indicated that the cost of replacing them would be about $3,500!=20

Is this normal for this type of repair? Are there cheaper=20
alternatives? What are the potential consequences if this goes=20
unfixed (my mechanic just indicated that I would need to check the=20
oil level with some frequency)?=20

Thanks

You can try to re-torque the heads and see if that will do it.  But 
eventually the oil will get into the cooling system.  Worse yet, the 
coolant getting into the cylinder.  You can tell when your exhaust is 
smoking white.  By that time, the cylinder wall would be scored due to 
lack of lubrication.  I would at least do a compression check in an 
attempt to locate the trouble area.  $3000-3500 sounds about right to 
me.
