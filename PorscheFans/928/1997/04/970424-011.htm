In reply to Pete Jones:

 My wipers do the same thing. If I tap the "wiper stalk" several times (down, 
for the intermittent mode) the wipers will move slightly, and then the next 
time I tap it, they will sweep all the way across. The int. feature will work 
fine. 

This could be from the contact surface corroding, or the contact spring 
loosing some tension, or both. It isn't bad enough to take it apart yet. 
Sometimes I have to tap the lever it for 30 seconds or so, but it always 
works. If I get really sideways, sometimes it stops working, and I will have 
to mess around with it for a few seconds. 

Hope this helps,

Jim 88 S4
