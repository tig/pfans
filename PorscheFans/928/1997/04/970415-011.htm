Greetings All;
I recently picked up my first 928 ('89 S4) and have been quite happy with   
it.  I do have a couple questions I wanted to ask some long-time   
drivers... My hatch frame squeaks horribly (new seal time?), and no   
amount of diddling and adjusting will get it to stop- it's quite   
annoying.  Anyone had a similar problem? The automatic tranny shift   
patterns seem to depend heavily on current speed and throttle position- I   
got the impression from a recent posting here that the kickdown switch   
does not actually make contact unless some tab on the rear of the pedal   
is bent- seems odd.  Lastly, has anyone had a positive experience with   
DME upgrades or "performance chips" from a particular mfgr.? Thanks for   
listenin'-
