I had the same concern about tire wear but I just got
the answer that they are set agressively by default
plus the tires wear out since they're Z rated.  I got 
about 8 K on mine last year (9 months?)

The other thing someone mentioned was to drive more 
aggressively so the outsides would wear the same. ;)

Now I do have something on my options list called
"sport suspension" so this may have something to do
with it.  Anyone know what this means?  I did notice 
by the color coding that the shocks were different from
the stock ones listed in the shop manuals.  The manuals
list several options - they're either the Bilsteins
or Konis vs the stock Boges - can't remember which one.

btw - anyone done any suspension conversions to factory 
options?  For example there is one setup mentioned
in the factory manual where there are two shocks per
rear wheel that looks interesting.
