From what I've seen, that's typical. Might have something to do with
the good conductivity of the aluminum engine.

My car had pretty severe brake fade on a warm day at the track. Enough
so that I couldn't have locked the brakes with all my strength. 
Changing the brake fluid to a higher boiling point fluid (Ate Blue
in my case, but there are others) and changing the pads to
Performance Friction 80 solved the problem, at least for the level
of stress I put on them (at the track, which is much higher than
any sane level of street driving). First thing to do would be
the new brake fluid, it's cheap and probably needs changing
anyway.
