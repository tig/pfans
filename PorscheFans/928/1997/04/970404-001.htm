> Leonard, I read a message that you posted to a person whom from what I
can
> tell has no understanding of how to get 700hp or what it feels like to
> drive a street car with this power level (dreamer).  Anyway, I thought
I'd
> e-mail you because you seem to have some experience with 928's.
> Problems with my 928 include a flat spot from 3000 up through 4000.  I
> understand that this is perceived as normal for this car (32v 928) .  Is
> this true?  This flat spot is more pronounced at various times, and is
not
> related to ambient air temp. In fact, sometimes the flat spot seems
> missing.  Any Ideas??? Second, there is small ( well, it actually varies
> between small surges and medium, and they are very rapid ) engine surging
> between 2700 to 3100 rpm's. This goes away at WOT. Ideas??? The car has
the
> euopean test pipe, Autothority Chips, K&N air filter. No other
> modifications.  P.S. --all of these symtoms were present before any
> modifications. Car has 46000 mi. and is a 5 speed.  thanks for any
> information! toeknee@ecom.net
