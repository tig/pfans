Once a year, normally on a Saturday, the Porsche Distributors in Oz have a Porsche
clinic; they choose a Porsche dealer in a large city, invite owners to come in
and have their cars checked over.  The list of items checked is extensive,
probes the whole car.  There may be food, drink, nintendo, and test drives
of new models available.  For last weekend, they had a Boxter and 911 Carrera
available for anyone who wished to test drive it, no obligation.  I am sure that
many of you have experienced the same event in your own country, put on by your
local distributor. eg. PCNA

A booking has to be made, and owners can seek a preferred time.  Depending on the
dealer, owners will be invited into the workshop to look at their own and other
cars, talk to the mechanics and other owners informally, and generally soak up
a lot of the atmosphere that our cars tend to generate.  From the moment I arrived,
(having sought permission to take photographs !) I just could not get enough of the
sights and sounds of the cars... on the ground, up on a hoist, or just listening
to the flat sixes scream as they conducted various tests before easing them out for
a final test run after the inspection.

Of the 40 cars inspected, about 10 were 928s of various years and type.  I think
we had every model represented except the 928 GT.  We even had 1 1982 928, with 
less than 20,000 miles on the Odometer !  The best part about this car was that it
had been lovingly maintained, had every service, and was obviously well looked after
by... I think the same owner since new.

My turn came around too soon, and I introduced myself to the inspecting mechanic.
He spent about an hour going over the car and commented that this was one of the
best 1985 models he had seen.  My car had a 60,000 mile service in January which
was the subject of another long posting to the chat board in February.

Anyway, while out on the test drive, the head mechanic and my inspecting mechanic
commented on the harshness of the drivetrain on initial acceleration and some
vibration/noise feedback in the steering.  Having owned the car for only 18 months
and only had experience with 3 other cars, I had thought the harshness indicative
of the model.  The steering I was not sure about.  Back at the workshop, and up on
the hoist, the engine mounts and steering rack were inspected; engine mounts were
found to have sagged.

The mechanics advise that tired engine mounts can often damage the steering rack,
and could possibly be the cause of the noise in the steering.

The above explanation sounds plausible but just wanted to seek any comments that
others may have about this.  To replace the mounts and rack, it appears the sub
frame assembly (not sure what this means) has to be dropped down out of the way
and the new items inserted.  Any repair to a Porsche in Oz is expensive, but this
one is extremely so.  I will definitely replace the motor mounts, but does the
rack have to be replaced too ?  I suppose it makes sense if you are spending
all that labour Dollar removing the various bits in that area.
