Hi 928 Fans. I'm new to the list, as of today. I drive a 1984 944, now with
over 190M miles on it. It's still perfect and runs like a sewing machine.
But I've always admired the gorgeous lines and streamline design of the 928,
so I've been keeping my eyes open. (All Porsche's seem to be the only cars I
can recognize from afar, nowadays. The rest all look the same.) 

I just discovered a 1991 GT 5-speed, for sale. (And I prefer the stick to an
automatic) While I haven't looked at it yet, the seller states that it's
loaded, and has less than 60,000 on the odometer. He's asking $33,975. Is
this a fair price? Does anybody really know? 

Because according to a reliable 928 spokesmen who specializes in selling
inventoried used parts for 928s over the Internet, the problem is that there
are so few 928s in existence in the U.S.today, there's no national used 928
market. There's little criteria upon which to base a fair price. That's why
few Porsche outlets or even Porsche repair services even stock 928 parts,
and why these 928 parts people referred to above are in business. (A red
flag? If you need a 928 part right away, must you order it over the Net and
have to pace back and forth waiting to receive it?) So those of us who covet
and you who drive 928s, apparently represent whatever small market exists
today. 

My question? If there's no used 928 Porsche market criteria upon which to
judge a given 928's value, other than the usual mileage and obvious body and
paint standards, and ignoring supply and demand, how are 928 values determined??

Anyone??
