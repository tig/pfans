Howdy All,

First off, let me say thanks for the great responses that everyone gave
me!!!  I think that all of my problems have been identified, I am refering to
my car of course!!!  Especially the mystery coolant leak.

As far as my breaks, I think the first place to start is the brake fluid.  I
know that my car sat pretty much idle for a couple of years before I
bought it and I am sure that a brake fluid replacement is well overdue. 
Replacing the fluid will also give me the oppertunity to take all the wheels
off and visually inspect the pads and rotors.   I have done break
bleadings before, but was warned that there are special considerations
with the ABS on the 928.  Here are my questions:

1.Is there a good tool, like a suction pump, or some trick that I should
know before I attempt the brake fluid replacement?

2.  What are good brake fluids to use?  Please indicate the manufacturer
and proper name.  I am new to this game and don't know the slang yet. 
But, I will soon enough.

3.  What are the special consideration for replacing the brake fluid?

Thanks again for the responses!!!

Matt Butler

My 928S used to squeal alot until I re-bled the entire brake system, 
including the clutch's slave cylinder.  Also, Pressure-bleeding is the 
way to go.
