Yes, repeatedly and with great pleasure!

- everything needed to resolve problems, including some sticky ones which
had baffled other shops or had caused the others to say something along the
lines of "None of our other customers drives that fast, so we don't know";
this repair work has always been done thoroughly, thoughtfully (looking for
actual causes rather than just replacing parts until something changes),
and at quite moderate cost.

- significant modification (specifically the custom reprogramming of the
fuel and ignition computers, done with the car on their chassis dyno, with
entirely positive and quite impressive results), again done knowledgeably
and thoughtfully.

- routine maintenance and "little things", done expediently and without
disdain

- advice to the sometimes nervous, sometimes overly revved-up about
potential modifications, owner; always reasonable, cost-sensitive, and
practical.

>Was it worth the price ?, How much ?


The engine reprogramming cost 50% more than buying generic chips from
Autothority, for which I got:

- more power than the generics could have given on any engine, let alone my
specific example (they all differ)

- the right torque curve for my taste and purposes

- full before-and-after documentation of actual performance

- no question of safety (full inspection before mods began)

A real bargain! 

In case it's not clear, I'm thrilled with Autosport, and I've got to drive
an hour to get to them.
