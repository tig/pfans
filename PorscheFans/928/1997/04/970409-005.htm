  The value seems to vary by area of the country, but here in Austin the
  range for '83/'84 models seems to be $8.5K - $12K depending on condition
  and mileage.  Sounds like your friend's car should be at the higher end 
  based on those two factors, although I tend to think that 5-speeds command
  a slightly higher premium since they are less plentiful.  I had searched for 
  6 months before buying my car back in '88 because there were so few 5-speed 
  cars on the market in this area.  I was amazed/appalled at how many people 
  will totally trash out such an expensive car...
