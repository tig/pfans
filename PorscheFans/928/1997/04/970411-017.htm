Speaking of the good ol Dunlop D40's..  What's wrong with them? :)
-Why- are they so cheap? I regularly see them for less than $100 in the
225/50ZR16 size we all know & love. I recall Excellence moaning & groaning
about the D40's in their article on the 87 S4, but does anyone have
anything else to
share?

I just bought a set to replace the bald, uh, Nittos, that were on the car
when I got it, so anything would be a replacement. I wonder if Im missing
something here.. 

btw, roaming around downtown San Jose the other day (actually, waiting
for my tires to be installed), I noticed a turquiose '79 928 5sp NO
sunroof on a used car lot for $5900. It looks okay, but I didnt check it
out very closely since Im quite happy with my 83. The body looked decent
(nice & clean without the extra spoilers & wings), and it had 17"
5-spokes. Couldnt tell how it ran since the dealer 'lost the keys'.
Yeah..helpful.

Now at least I can scoot up HWY 17 & not have to worry about meetingMr
