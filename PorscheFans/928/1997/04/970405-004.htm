I still am not certain with this explaination.  Would the flap really
be pegged??  I assume that you can "ram" only a certain amount of air.
The increase air flow from a turbo or a supercharger comes from
introducing "compressed" air into the cylinder, not more volume.

The FI problem if you were to install a turbo is that the brain think
it is getting a certain volume of air at atmospheric pressure and not
at 1 bar.  I would assume that a stronger spring on the flap would
solve this problem (or a different chip if you have a hot wire system
like my 85).

Still somewhat confused,
