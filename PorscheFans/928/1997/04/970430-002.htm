 Chris, on my 86 the instrument light dimmer switch (little wheel under
the dash to the left of the steering wheel) sometimes acts up and goes
from the bright setting to completely off.  If you jiggle [ I believe
that is the technical term :-)] it a little bit, it works again.  I
don't know if the 79 has the same switch, but maybe this helps.  I got a
new key through 928 International, but I think you can get them directly
from Porsche also.
