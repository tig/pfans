just 

Let's not forget that email is very impersonal and that a msg. read one way
is probably not the way it was meant, know what I mean?

I think most emails are typed with a smile or wink in mind, or, are
generally inquisitive in nature.  Like when I type "check this out" it
isn't an order or anything but more like, hey dude, check this out, how
weird!

I missed the msg on the fuel filter, am enjoying the banter / debate
regarding chevy vs. porsche V8 engines & applications and also apologize if
I've offended anyone mistakenly (who me?) with anything in my posts...  The
members of this list are a great bunch - I've corresponded since before
buying my first 928, have met many of them at shops, dyno and soon the
track and at beer night in SF, etc.

Let's continue to have fun, share the wealth of knowledge on the best road
car Porsche ever built and swap bench racing stories in between the actual
events!

Again, the only dumb questions are the ones that didn't get asked...
Rising water raises all ships!

(ie. anyone remember me wondering months back if I could polish these
wheels with a Dremel tool?  One reply was that the Dremel is toy!  And
after completing the project I wholeheartedly agree it NEVER would've
worked.  Matter of fact I burned out an electric hand drill and had to buy
a new one after the first wheel!  The point is don't worry about how silly
or 'dumb' the question is - you want to find out the answer right!?!  So
ask away...)
