Aha! I knew either you or Leonard would have the answer! Thanks a lot for
the info,Phil. That issue looks to me like a definite "Must have"! One
small problem however; from whence does one purchase said book?
Unfortunately (and having recently spent 10 days in LA and San Francisco I
really DO mean unfortunately!) I live on the other side of the pond in the
UK . Do you by any chance have an address where I can order this from? I
don't intend to race her, I simply like a "Tight" car (Earlier this evening
I went for a blast after having adjusted the rear spring heights: Gods! The
way she handles now!

Is it true you live in the San Francisco area Phil? If so you are one lucky
man! As I say I was there a couple of weeks ago and fell completely in love
with the place. *Sigh!* Anyway, thanks agin for the info Phil and I'd be
really grateful if you could let me know of an address to get this book.

Regards,
Daron
1981 928S Auto.
