Hello Porschefans,

It's time to replace the timing belt on my 87 928S4.  I was just going
to change the belt but I received a book from "Automotion" and it said
that any 928 88 and older was prone to premature belt failure due to
excessive pressure and heat build up.  They sale an updated timing belt
pulley guide and cover which is suppose to prevent this.  Have any of
you tried this product? Do you know if it is really helps or if this is
just some gimmick to try and make you think your doing right by adding
this product.

Thanks
Gavin H.
