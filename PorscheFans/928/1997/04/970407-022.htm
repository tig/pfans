   I had simiar trouble, though it was not leaking that badly.  Upon 
closer examination it turned out several of the bolts had loosened 
considerably.  The leak is now quite small, and certainly not enough to 
have to rush for a gasket replacement.  Torque value for these M6 type 
bolts is 8 + 2 Nm, or 6 + 1 ft-lb.
