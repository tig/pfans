Hi!
Recently there has been some talk about tires for 928s and what kinds to avoid.  Specific
comments were made about the undesirability of Goodyears.  I'm baffled by this and would
appreciate any insight that the list might be able to provide.  I have had Goodyear Eagle
225/50 ZR16 tires on my stock '86 928S for three years and have had no troubles or
complaints with then on either the road or at drivers education, where I routinely
turn over 130 mph.  They are reasonably priced and I have had no separations, vibrations,
etc. as I have with other tires.  
I am raising this issue because my 928 is now in the shop for a suspension upgrade of the 
kind recommended by Kim Crum.  Specifically, I am putting on Koni "Red" shocks and the
Automotion (Weltmeister) proportional spring set that Kim runs.  I have also obtained
a set of S4 wheels and intend to put the Goodyear Eagle 245/45 ZR16 tires on the rear.
What am I missing here?  Any relevant information would be appreciated.
Best regards.
