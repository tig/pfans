Dear 928 fans.

A week ago I told you guys about my car wich was loosing 
horsepower. I checked all the vacuumhoses,but that was oke.
The 928 s4 hase three fuelregulators. Can any one tell me
if the two fuelregulators ,located under the airfilterbox
return the fuel back to the tank , ore otherwise around,and let
the fuel go to the fuelinjectors.

And what should be the fuelpresure at : idle
                                        2000 rpm
                                        full pull
it is a 928 s4 1989 car.

thanks and greeting from HOLLAND.

I don't own a chipped 928 so I'm really saying this just for what it's 
worth.  EPROMs do have a data retention life; somewhere in the 50 years 
range.  This is assuming that the chip is not exposed to strong UV 
light thru the window.  I routinely erases EPROMs just by putting them 
on my car's dash to let it expose to sunlight while driving around.  It 
would be erased in about 45 minutes.  The time would be shorter if the 
EPROMs have been reused a few dozen times as well as the ability to 
retain data.  So I trash them after 40 reprogramming.

Now, if Authority uses surplus EPROMs for re-sale, (you can find them 
surplus for about 50 cents a piece...) then I would question the 
reliability of its data retention capability.  How do you know if the 
EPROMs are new?  Well, you really don't know unless a manufacturing 
date is stamped on it.  Something to think about...
