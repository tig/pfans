The back of a 928 is bigger than a 911 but not by that much.  There is
only 2 seatbelt so I don't think your local PD will like the
idea of 3 passenger back there.  Looks like you're in for a MINIVAN :0

As far as for using the car in the snow, I personaly never tried but
with 4 WINTER tires on and a light foot on the accelerator, it should
be OK.  I even heard a story where they took Porsches to Alaska and
their jeep broke down.  The 928 ended up towing the jeep back to camp.
