Hi Frank,

I just completed updating and restoring the interior on my '79 928 and came 
across the same issues.  I also installed a six speaker stereo system in the 
car.  I'll be happy to share my experiences with you.  

The rear panels do come out pretty easily *IF* you know what to remove.  

1) First raise the glass hatch, pop out the rear trunk cover (the one that 
contains the tools) and lower the seats.

2) Remove the handles just above and behind the front passenger's heads.  

3) Next remove the large nuts that hold the bottom end of the seat belts to 
the chassis.  You'll have to remove the hand brake cover on the driver's side 
and the plastic cover on the passenger's side

4) Look closely at the corners of the one piece unit and identify/remove the 
screws that hold them in place as well as the screws that hold the middle of 
the wide portion in the trunk area.  Later cars may not have as many screws.

5) Now for the hard part, using a screwdriver, ***CAREFULLY***  pry away the 
upper pylon portion of the cover by disengaging the clips that hold it to the 
chassis.  On my car, these were not the standard plastic upholstery pins but 
some weird metal notched pins.  They do come loose with enough pressure.

6) Once done, slightly raise and remove the entire one piece unit from the 
open hatch.

Replacement the reverse of removal.

FYI, there is allot of foam between that big one piece unit and the chassis in 
the rear of the car.  That foam can be cut away to accomidate a deep set 4x6 
speaker secured to the rear cover.  

FYI2, some cars have speaker holes in the front portion of the one piece rear 
cover. If your's doesn't, you can still mount a 3.5" round bass speaker there 
by ***CAREFULLY*** cutting a hole for the speaker in the upholstery and using 
using a reciprocating saw to cut a square space behind it in the well below 
the seat belt loop (you'll see what I mean when you get the cover off.  This 
doesn't weaken the chassis (according to a Porsche dealer mechanic here in 
Houston).  Anyhow, it was a pain to do but worth it in the end.  My sound 
system is great!

Good Luck!!!
