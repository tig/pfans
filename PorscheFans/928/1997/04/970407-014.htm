Subject: Chevy 928
From: Ed Ruiz <eruiz@ids2.idsonline.com>

....also, the basic 928 engine has far more potential than a basic chevy V8.
To me the thought of swapping out the 928 engine for a chevy is ludicrous.

I wouldn't necessarily agree with this.  If you are talking about an S4,
then yes, a DOHC 4-valve engine does seem to offer more *potential* than  a
simple OHV 2- valve engine.  However, once must keep in mind that the Chevy
V-8 is probably *the* most highly modified engine in history, which means
that there are many, many more performance parts available for considerably
less money than you could find for a 928.  I don't think it would be that
hard to get 400 HP out of a small block Chevy in streetable trim.  A basic
pre S4 engine does not offer more performance potential.  In fact, it most
likely has much less.  Just because it has an aluminum block and SOHC
doesn't mean it will produce more power.  One serious problem would be the
lack of any available induction system upgrades for the CIS injection and
the low compression of the US engines.  I think the 928 motor is also heavier.

I do agree that putting in a Chevy V-8 would change the character of the
car, and I would certainly not recommend it in any later model 928.
However, for the owner of an older 928 with perhaps a tired engine, a swap
like this could be very cost effective.  Old 928s aren't worth much these
days anyway, so changing the motor wouldn't negatively affect their value.

Fascinating thread, gentlemen!  One of the things we admire most about
Porsche designs is the continuous development, turning even pig's ears
(e.g., rear engine chassis... but of course I'm not posting this on the 911
digest!) into competent, even brilliant statements of the engineers' art.
For all the limitations of Chevy's engines (weight, high inertia valve
trains, inherently poor gas flow, oiling problems during high lateral-G
operation, etc.) the level of development has been astonishing.  Properly
done, these slugs will rev 7,500 to 8,500 rpm damn near forever with big
horesepower and balanced, accessible torque.

Compare the 928 engine.  Even the good folks at DEVEK will acknowledge that
928's have oiling problems at relatively low RPM, and that their clever
fixes won't allow much more than 7,500 revs after they're installed.  One
could claim that the 928's long-life design -- understressed, low piston
speed, hydraulic lifters -- contributes to the engine's size, but the GM
iron was also conceived as a low-stress powerplant and is: smaller, easier
to cool and "plumb," has none of the catastrophic consequenses of the
(relatively) short lived cam-drive belts, and can be easily rebored (no
special nikasil liners to worry about).  I don't know about weight, but it
does appear that there is a LOT more 928 aluminium than there is Chevy iron.

Yes, conversions probably bring more problems & costs than the simple
difference between a built-up Chevy & a built-up 928 engine (be it 16v or
32v)... ASSUMING that you keep the 928's transaxle... how would you mount
the clutch?  The 928's narrow central tunnel takes advantage of the compact
clutch.  How would you mount the driveshaft?  See the "Project 928" book for
a discussion of the challenges Porsche faced on eliminating/reducing
destructive vibrations -- also, see Ferrari's similar experiences with the
mid-60's 275GTB &, more recently, the 465 & 550 Maranello -- and ask any
Alfa transaxle driver (GTV-6, Milano) about driveshaft vibration & failure.
Scrap the Porsche's stout transaxle and where are you going to mount the
rear suspension (or did your conversion prices include a solid rear end with
quarter-eliptic leaf springs)?

I think Tom Pultz's economic analysis -- that there are a lot of really
tired early 928's out there with essentially nowhere to go, value wise -- is
essentially correct, and this should encourage tinkerers.  But I don't see
the payoff for these people or these cars being found in the course of
putting things ON.  TRY TAKING THINGS OFF.  The 928's only real problems
come from its weight (lots of stuff) and it's complexity (lots of stuff to
go wrong).  I think we should be encouraging people to strip these Porkers
down to their essentials.  Take off the power-everything, doors, locks,
sunroofs, mirrors, rear wipers, antennae. By the time a 928 goes below say
$6,000 this stuff is either broken or about to quit anyway.  Take off the
a/c, the cracked/warped dash, the enormous spare tire/battery pan, the torn
upholstery.  Rip out the majority of the wiring harness, the radio, the
alarm, the cell-phone connection, most of the interior lighting, the 37-way
wipers, triple washers, power seats.  Get rid of the sound deadening... most
of it has already rotted, crumbled or fallen off in any case.

Let's say this brings the car down to about 2,800# vs the roughly 3,500# stock.
with an early US 4.5L engine, the power to weight ratio of 3,500#/220hp =
15.9#/hp.  A 2,800#/220hp car = 12.7#/hp.  You would need to get 275hp -- a
55hp/25% increase, from a stock 3,500# car to match this power-to-weight
ratio.  And, as Colin Chapman said, "add power and you'll go fast in a
straight line; add lightness and you'll go fast everywhere."

Many of us will preserve our grand luxo-barges in the manner intended...
pristine, unblemished, supple & strong.  MOST 928's, however, will decay,
for all of the reasons that now make them such good used car values.  But we
know that most of the 928's high maintenance costs are based on the complex,
inaccessible electrical accessories & spectacular trim levels.  I propose we
all think about rescuing a beater 928, or considering the real future of our
current cars (as the economics of mega-depreciation make each repair more
difficult to justify).  Just look at all the guys having fun with their
beater 914's & 911's at the autocross or club race, or who park ANYWHERE
they want (my car just got comprehensively "keyed" by some miscreant).  The
insistence on maintaining the 928's "character" is precisely what's killing
most of them off!

I know that I'll probably keep my '86 for ten years.  I also know that the
last few of these it will be a barely streetable stripped beauty... hot,
noisy, bouncy & lots of fun.

Sorry for the long post, but I think we've been ignoring the "second life"
built into every 928.  Anyone car to comment on the weight of a stripper?
