| Subject: Squeaking Brakes
| 
| I'm ready to replace the brake pads on my 87S4 and wanted some ideas on how
| I could eliminate the squeaking I have experienced on my previous 2 brake
| jobs.  I've used the spray on and the brush on latex-like product that is
| supposed to silence the squeal. Note that the rotors are in great shape and
| have never been turned.  The car is up around 50K miles.

If you are using the stock pads and rotors, squeaky brakes are caused by the 
non-uniform contact of the pad to the rotor.  There are several causes of 
this:
1)  If you use new brakes too hard before they are bedded in, you can generate 
hot spots on the pad and cause them to crack.  A cracked pad will cause a 
squeak.  A good rule of thumb is, after installing new pads and/or rotors, 
brake lightly for 200 miles until the new stationary pads and rotating rotors 
get to know each other.
2)  If you have floating calipers, make sure they can float.  Lubricate the 
pins that the caliper moves on with a high temperature grease.  If one of 
these pins is sticking, it can cause a squealling noise when the brakes are 
applied.
3)  A sticking caliper piston.  Make sure each piston moves easily within its 
cylinder.  Changing the fluid once a year helps tremendously to eliminate 
sticking pistons.

I hope this helps, and I'm sure you'll get more ideas from the list.

You can only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.

At least on my '83 928S, the weatherstripping on the rear hatch is 
around the full perimeter.  I don't think that there's a difference 
between an '83 and '86 is there?
