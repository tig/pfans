>>I've suspected somewhere a water valve isn't completely shut.  By =

>>the fan full speed I can "cool down" those outlets somewhat, but as =

>>I lower the airflow the air temp goes right back up. =20

>>Today I had the lever/switch/vacuum valve assembly in the center =

air

warm.
>>Any ideas where to start checking?

>>Using it will still give me a big smile.

>>Anyway, I look forward to thoughts on my warm air blues.

My 83 had the same problem, what i found was that the water valve =
located right underneath the air cleaner assembly(you have to take the =
assembly off to see it) had a pinhole leak in the vacuum diaphragm. =
Unfortunately, the default position for it is open(heating). Allyou will =
need is a good vacuum tester, b/c you can see the little plastic arm =
move without removing the valve. If your summer is anything like =
mine(Florida) then you may just opt to unsnap the vacuum diaphragm and =
move the valve shut w/ your finger, otherwise, check for vacuum when it =
is supposed to be cool.

P.S. I too found the downshift button...You'll never stop grinning :-)
