I replaced my front S spoiler about four years ago.  The trick is 
perseverance.  That damn spoiler has 4 million nuts and bolts holding the 
thing on and you have to mold, bend, and coax the thing into position while 
trying to thread various nuts &  bolts.  Cussing and swearing helped me.  

Using current = wattage / voltage -- 100W headlight bulbs at 12 volts draw 
about 8.3 amps.  I forget what size fuse Porsche puts in that circuit.  But if 
the fuse is only 8 amps (blue?) then you need interposing relays.

I have a Clarion CD player in my 928S.  No skipping whatsoever with the stock 
suspension.

I use Splitfire plugs (I also use them in my 300E).  I swear gas mileage has 
increased with them.  Splitfire's are a way to index plugs without having to 
use shims.  Indexing, BTW, is rotating the plug by using shims so the open end 
of the ground electrode is facing the intake valve; exposing the air/fuel 
mixture to the spark and resulting flame kernel.  The theory behind all this 
good, but actual performance varies.  Splitfire currently has a $1.00 per plug 
rebate going on.  I have K&N filters on my 928 and 300E.  I just cleaned the 
300E's filter.  There was debris on the outside of the filter, but the clean 
side of the air cleaner was spotless.

The grand essentials of happiness are: something to do, something to love, and 
something to hope for.
