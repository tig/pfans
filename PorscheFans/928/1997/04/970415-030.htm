Bruce Andersen (who is really a 911 guy) does a series of "market
reports" for Excellence magazine. He gives two prices for a '91 928
as of late '96: $26955 for low wholesale, $36425 for excellent
retail. Not quite clear what that means, and his methods have been
doubted by some, but it seems to say that the asking price is in 
the ballpark for a real good car. Incidentally, at that point,
S4 means automatic and GT means manual transmission; apparently
there were not very many of the latter imported into the US.

Actually, there weren't very many of _any_ kind of late-model
928 imported into the US, or even built for that matter. There
were a lot more of the earlier years (80's). But parts
availability shouldn't be a big problem; PCNA supports the
cars, and even has a new dial-a-part scheme if you can figure
out the part number you need (see the April Panorama). Of
course, the price of those parts is another matter.

Anyway, it sounds like a helluva car. The usual advice to have
it checked over by a competent unbiased 928 mechanic, ideally
the one who would maintain it for you, applies.
