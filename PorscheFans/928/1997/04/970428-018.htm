Hello Stephane, congratulations on putting it all back together!

Not wishing to suggest the obvious bu have you checked the hand-brake
shoes? Probably a silly question but they are really simple to check and
adjust and mine were binding a while back and I suffered similar (Rear
wheels only!) syptoms until I found the shoes to be binding... just a
thought.

Commiserations on having found what appears to be the worst Porsche dealer
in history! At least after 4 attempts you need never be tempted to
return... our cars are too special to be worked on by the inept (Myself
excluded, obviously!)

Good luck with the brakes et al!
