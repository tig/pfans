     Hi Everyone,
     
     When I got home last night I fired up the Pentium MMX 200 and went to 
     the Archives page.  I am now convinced that the Archives are the best 
     thing since sliced bread.  The person that commented on the "fuel 
     pump/muffler bearing" issue apologized. ( A very classy thing to do by 
     the way).  The comments on Chev engines in 928 continue with a great 
     letter from Rob Gold.  Rob has a feel for the real world of 928's.  I 
     pretty much agree with everything he says and he makes it fun to read 
     at the same time.  I will look forward to more from Ron.
     
     I would like to share my experiences with Chev V8's and Porsche 982's.
     
     I have owned 25 Corvettes.  When it comes to Chev V8's I have "Been 
     there, done that" ..... Corvette #1 was 1954, Corvette # 25 was 1987.  
     Don Knows Chevies!!!.  When my quad cam decided to break I considered 
     a Chev 350 as a replacement.  I visited Renegade Hybrids in S.Cal and 
     looked at what they had to offer.  They are really nice folks and gave 
     me the rundown on the V8 conversion kit.  I would have cost about $ 
     5,000 to do the job right.  I estimated that it would cost about the 
     same for a 4 valve rebuild.  The determining factor was the DEQ in the 
     state of Washington.  They don't care what is under the hood but what 
     ever it is, it has to pass.  Washington state uses the C.A.R.B 
     requirements for passing emissions.  If the car has the OEM motor, 
     there is a limit on how much the owner must to spend to pass.  If you 
     go over the limit you can ultimately get you tags.  If you have an 
     alternate motor and it won't pass, you must spend money UNTIL IT DOES. 
      
     I chose the OEM rebuild.  
     
     
     
     An Aside here:
     
     A number of years ago I was visiting my mother in the SF bay area.  I 
     was driving my 1980 928 (a real slug by the way)and I ran into a guy 
     that had put an all aluminum 454 Chev big block in his 82 928S.  The 
     motor was putting out about 450 HP on pump gas and was smog legal in 
     the bay area!!!! He had upgraded the brakes, Koni's all around and did 
     some work on the 5 speed.  This car was a real road warrior.  He would 
     go looking for Vettes and Ferrari's to have some fun with.  That kind 
     of car is not my cup of tea but it is an option.  He told me he had 
     about 10K$ in the car and 10K$ in the motor and upgrades.
     
     
     
     However!!
     
     After rebuilding 2 928 motors and feeling the satisfaction of a great 
     running car, I will stick with the OEM.  The 928 is not perfect but it 
     (for me) is the best road car I have ever owned.
     
     
     Didn't mean to run on but!!!
     
     Thanks,
     
     Don Vellenga
