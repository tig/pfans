Dear Aqualux,

I don't own a 928 yet, but from the general perspective of owning and
maintaining (55) other cars, I think your problem is air-flow or timing
related.

My first guess would have been the fuel filter - but you have replaced it
already.

Your air cleaner is OK?  No vacuum leaks?  I know, dumb questions.

I would check your exhaust system.  Is it slightly plugged?  I don't know
whether Holland was using catalysts in 1989, but plugged catalytic
converters are not that uncommon in the States and will definitely affect
mid and high rpm output.  You may be able to check this from the
color/condition of the plugs - plugged exhaust will yield higher than
normal temperatures (explaining the temporary plug gap reduction fix). 
Even if you don't have catalytic converters, you could possibly have an
exhaust restriction.

Another guess is that a timing belt has jumped a tooth on a camshaft. 
This would allow starting and basic operation to be just fine with a
definite loss of mid and high rpm power output.  This would be an early
warning sign of a failing belt or tensioner, ultimately fatal on four
valvers.

Let us know your solution.
