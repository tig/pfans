Hello Fans,

My settlement is coming this week from my insurance company for the
premature death of my Ocean Blue Metallic '88 944S (I believe that all
Porsches go to heaven so nobody worry...)  I will be posting a complete
account of my dealings with the Great Large and Powerful Insurance
Company when all of the ducks are in a row (to the 924-944 group
anyway...)  Maybe it will help the rest of you deal with them if you
have an accident.
Oh...And a BIG thanks to Jim and Jerry at European Performance
Engineering for their help with my invoices (I lost a couple of the
originals...)
Anyway,
here's the dilemma.  I was pretty much decided on my choice for my next
P-car.  The 968, anything but red, with the M030 option.  Occaisionally,
the turbo S would seem like a good idea, but would inevitably yield to
the 968 again...
Now, I did something REALLY dumb.  I drove an '89 928S4 with 40k odd
miles and was struck dumb with its sheer quiet intensity.  Mammoth
torque... Wow.  they wanted 26.9k (negotiable)  which is about what I
have been seeing '93 and '94 968's for.

I know they are completely different cars, and I have the 944 FAQ, and
have owned one, and fixed one so I know about how much they cost to feed
and care for.  But,  how does it compare to a 928?  Anybody own both? I
couldn't find a 928 FAQ so I'm asking.    Should I just forget it a
stick with the 4 banger?

(I opened the S4 hood and it appeared that it was 2 944S engines stuck
together with a huge aluminum intake manifold in between.  Does this
mean the maintenance of the 944S x's2?  Say no.  Please.)

I would even put up with an automatic tranny for this car (although a 5
sp would be better, but I understand that they are hard to find and more
valuable...)

Are there  any production figures available?


Thanks for the help
