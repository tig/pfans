Add a third - Dinan Engineering in Mountain View, CA.  The catch is they'd
need your car to do the development/testing.  But that's the way to go
(individualized chipset), just ask Leonard Laub!

The K&N touts superior filtration vs. standard paper elements - and it gets
better comparatively the dirtier it gets.  I have mixed feelings regarding
the performance aspect.  The dyno test didn't show much improvement (with
other mod's) but then the car was static and not getting any
ram-air/cold-air benefit from speed.  Where I did see real improvement was
at the track - my 928 S ran 15.0's all day which is 0.50 sec faster than


manufacturer data in the manual!

In any event, the less foreign matter our engines breathe the better, so
the K&N is a definate must have for any enthusiast for sure...  Cool
sticker for the airbox too, I bet we all have 'em in the same spot!

Don't do it (Splitfires).  Those are the plugs I ran for the dyno test. 
Everyone there warned me about them possibly self-destructing in the
engine, especially in boosted engines.  I switched to Bosch platinums
immediately thereafter and felt a change in throttle crispness and went on
to do great 1/4 mile runs for a car with 145k miles!   

The price differential alone would let you have fresh plugs in your car
always.

Another 928'r claims the only plug worth investing in is those
mileage-masters with the full ring electrode not just a L-shape like usual
but I have no personal experience there.  Yet.  :)
