Hello to all!,
	I recently bought a '79 model that was kissed in the left front. The
tie-rod was broken, the steering arm bent---but after replacing those
items and throwing my Dunlop alignment guages on it, the car drove and
handled fine.Presently the car is on a frame machine to pull the
uni-body back into line (I've heard the car is kinda soft
there--especially the upper sheet metal). The frame guy pulled it and
had the impact bumper mounts on proper center----all lower measurements
like a-arm pick-up points and such panned out. My problem is the gap
between fender and hood on each side(with the hood closed) is looking
very tight. Could any of you comment on what the proper spacing is??.
I'm concerned because the spacing between the leading edge of the doors
and fenders is about twice what I'm seeing up top between fender/hood.
Is this normal?.
	Also, I've not seen many postings regarding parts and pieces for sale
by subscribers. Is there any rules or protocol on the list regarding
this?. I have to think there are a number of do-it-yourself types like
myself that have realised the bang for the buck that the 928 offers, and
may have parts available. Devek and 928 Int'l are fine sources, but the
current value of the early cars requires one to be careful in how much
he or she invests in bringing them back.
	I need a LF fender--U.S. spec. I picked up a Euro spec fender for a
song, but I'm not interested in doing all the work on it to re-locate
lights and such. Anyone have a resonably priced fender out there?.

Anyway, the engine was completely rebuilt 10K miles ago. The powder rods
were changed out for the forged ones, rotating assemblys balanced, and
the car pulls strong. Even though here in Denver we lose about 15% of
the available power due to altitude.It's sounding like one of the best
mods to make early on involve shock/springs and maybe a different front
sway bar. Anyone care to comment on which would yield the most
improvement for $$$$ spent?.

And last, anyone have experience on durability of the torque tube when
increasing power?. I'm seriously considering fitting twin
high-efficiency roots blowers to my car.

Glad I found this list!!!--it's obvious how much all of you love the
928!!---a great car!!
