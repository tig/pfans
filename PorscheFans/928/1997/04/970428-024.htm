What part are you missing?  If it is just the black rubber part, it can
be found for < $300 in the add in Excellence.  I am not sure how hard
it is to install but I will need a new one on my car.  My mechanic tells 
me he could probably find a used one for $100 to 150...

Now, I am in need to find an owner of an 85 928 S, that could send me
a picture of the wiring in their car.  My problem is that I bought my
car with the wire in the wrong position so it is hard for me to
figure out where the wires actually goes.

In particular, I am looking for pictures with the 2 snorkel removed
so to clearly show the ignition wires and a picture of each side of
the engine without the big  air intake (the one stamped 32 V).

If someone can provide me with these, I would appreciate it greatly.

TIA
