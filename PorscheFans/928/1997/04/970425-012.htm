heh heh, why yes, of course she knows ;)     Actually the first site to
post was the miata.net back in '92 when the car was new (as in the
picture).  

That ticket *should have been * mine.  I was driving at 95+ for maybe an
hour, got tired and pulled over to switch.  She had been driving not 3
minutes, when bang - CHP car!  Appears they were tracking me with a Vascar
spotter plane, but since she was driving, she got the ticket!  She was
speeding too anyways.

That of course did not deter her from much frantic arm-waving and trying to
turn me in instead!  Her pleas fell on deaf ears though, and only my
picture taking got the officer to crack a smile.

We still had a great drive and 4th of July weekend in Santa Barbara back
then...
