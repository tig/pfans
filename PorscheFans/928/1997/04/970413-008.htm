<also former 911 owner>

I have transported my baby nephew no problem with his baby seat in the back
of my 928.  But not all seats will fit so you might need to persuade the
store to let you test fit.  Make sure you try with the baby seat facing
forward and backward so you won't have to change seats over time.  (I don't
know if a two year old can ride facing forward yet - you know the deal
about their neck muscles being strong enough to survive a frontal crash
etc.)

The bonus is all the rear storage area for baby bags, etc.  The big bonus
for baby is being able to touch the rear speaker grills (never fails to
intrigue him / his fingernails), the rear window visors to block the sun
and the soothing hum of the V8.  Sometimes he hums in mimic of the engine. 
Pretty funny huh?

I have no idea about snow driving but imagine with proper snow tires the
928 should be fine - 3600 lbs. and 50/50 distribution.  Someone else needs
to comment, also about rustproofing ?  FWIW, I rather be in the 'bigger,
heavier, wider" 928 than the 911 in the event of a collision...

re: annual costs
No different than any other V8 based sportycar - oil changes, brake checks,
etc.  Of course you mentioned mid-80's cars and most of those will have a
fair amount of mileage on them by now.  So initial cost might be high as
you do any deferred maintenance the car might require.  

Good luck on the 928 hunt,
Phil Tong
