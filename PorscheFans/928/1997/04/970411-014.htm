I assume these new springs are lowered and stiffened? If so do you (or
anyone else for that matter; Phil? Leonard?) have any settings for the toe,
camber and caster with lowered suspension? I've just fitted the Eibach kit
to my '81 928S and it is great with the factory settings for normal ride
height but I would love to hear of anyone's findings to give me a bit more
"Bite" (I have always tended towards a little more neg. camber than
suggested to improve turn-in and sharpness, ok so the tyre wear is
marginally increased but hey, what price fun!?) Any pointers in this area
gratefully received!

TIA
