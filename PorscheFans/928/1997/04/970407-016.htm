Yes, this has been an exciting thread! Unfortunately, several people have
made the erroneous assumption that I had a standard tranny. Nope. It's an
automatic and that's why I was worried about 500 to 600 hp blowing it up.
I may be wrong again, but I _don't_ have the 100% over-engineering to fall 
back on. (Please, someone truthfully tell me I'm wrong and the automatic is
just as over-engineered as the standard.)

No, Leonard, I nowhere near done rationalizing! ;-)

I'm not converting it to a Chevy block, yet. Just thinking about it. 

BTW -- stripping the car down to reduce weight is a great idea, but I feel
most of the fun of driving the car is the combo of power, handling and luxury.
I'm not autocrossing...I'm commuting.
