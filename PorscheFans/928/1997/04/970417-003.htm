Howdy All,

I have had my 928 for about 5 months now and have really enjoyed it,
except for the $1800.00 repair bill that I got a couple of months ago, but
you gotta pay if you want to play.  

I have put about 10,000 on it since I purchased it and I am starting to
notice some degredation in its performance.  A lot of this seems to be
suspension related.  I just put new tires(Dunlop D40M2's) all the way
around. The tires that were on it before were a hogde podge of Dunlop's
and Perelli's, but the interesting thing is that it doesn't seem to corner as
well with the new tires.  Is it time for new shocks or springs?  My
maintenance records don't show that they have ever been replaced.  I
also notice that the car is much more willing to bottem out in the front
than it was when I first got it.  



The other day on the way home I took a wrong turn in an area of DC that
I wasn't familier with and ended up sitting in traffic for two hours.  After I
getting done telling myself to never take that turn again, I started to
notice that my car was running hotter than normal.  I have two question
related to this.

1.  Is there some part of the cooling system that is known to go bad at
this age(heater coil, small hoses that are hard to get to etc. etc.)  I can't
seem to locate a leak, but my coolant does have a slow leak.  

2.  With the car running a little warm(BTW - not so warm that I was
concerned) and sitting in traffic, the 928 was putting out a LOT of heat.  I
could see the heat waves off of the hood.   It was also about 75
degrees that day.  I did get a chance to dart through some back road and
a lot of quick starts and stops.  I notice that my braking really started to
drop off.  The pedal became soft and I felt like the POWER in the POWER
brakes just disappeared.  I did have one really hard braking experience
thanks to an unattentive biker.  Now that I am back to more normal
driving, my brakes seem to be fine.  Was my lose of braking most likely a
function of heat build up or could it be something else?

If any of you have any advice that might help me figure this out I would
appreciate it!!!
