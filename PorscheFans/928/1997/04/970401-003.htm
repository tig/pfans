I was afraid of that. I was looking at the cover a few days ago and saw
about a bazillion screws. I hoped most of them did something trivial
like hold the transmission on. Obviously I was wrong.

Yes, I can see that on one side... that's how much the bolster has
warped.

With my talents, that's the *only* way I can go!

I really hadn't thought about how to fix it. I was going to get it out
first, take it to an upholstery shop, and get some advice. Fixing it in
place just isn't an option because I can't get under the bolster to
straighten it out and re-fasten it to the cover. Plus the
metal/fiberglass (?) shell is warped, so it needs to come out to be
straightened. I do believe that I should be able to soften the leather
with leather treatment and start from there. It's in good shape (or so I
believe), no cracks or discoloration.

Thanks for the advice, and I will keep all posted!

Pete
