|17 mm spacers appeared on the rear wheels of the 928 S4 Club Sport (a
|preview of the GT, probably nonexistent in the US) in '88 and the 928 GT in
|'89. They stayed with the GT through its production run and appeared on the
|GTS as well.

Thought I would add my pedantic 2 cents also. I ordered my GTS from the factory
and it does not nor ever did have spacers. There... I feel much better ;-)

I had this arguement with someone before saying the wider rear track was
produced merely by adding spacers, this is not true!

For those interested I talk to Kim yesterday and he was working on some GTS
production figures so I thought I would share them here. I missed the one I was
interested in scribbling the numbers down, anyway here is what I have:

Total GTS production 736 (1992-1996)
model year        US imports      How many of these were Manual (stick)
1993              120             [twenty something]
1994               84             13 !
1995-6            100             28

No wonder the factory closed down production. A sad thing though for such a
thoroughbred machine.

>Anyway, who is Red McCintock?

A legendary Porsche mechanic that past away last year.  He knows 
everything that needs to know about the 928.
