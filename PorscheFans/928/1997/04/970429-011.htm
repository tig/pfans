I think that I have found my problem with the unit.  Looking at the 
replacement unit, I read a 5.2 ohm reading between the terminal (with
the sender not connected or installed in the car).  I took my
wiring harness connector apart and look at the resistance between
pin #2 and #4 and get an open circuit.

Now I just have to crawl under the car and see if I get any resistance
at the sending unit itself.

As anyone ever changed part of their wiring harness?

I was wondering if you can rebuild the harness by either getting new
pins and keeping the old plugs of even unwelding the wires from the 
plug and welding new wires in their place.  

Any advice will be welcome.

P.S.  This will do nothing to help my messy wiring system.  I guess I
could make the wires as loonf or as short as I want and make it look
neat :)
