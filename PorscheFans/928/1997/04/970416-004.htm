Okay, fine.  Join PCA or POC.  They've got lots of sanctioned events =
using real race tracks, safety inspections, rules, helmets, fire =
extinguishers, etc.

That makes perfect sense.

> There are some formidable twisties broken up by 2 one mile =
straight-aways.

strenghts, etc.

If you don't know the answer to this, please don't use a public =
thoroughfare to find out.

So there is a good probability of mayhem.  I see.

And your last brake overhaul was when?

type)!

All too well.
