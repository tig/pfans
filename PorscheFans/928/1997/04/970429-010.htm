The rear disks and pads were changed.  The front driver side was
taken apart and the guide pin lubricated, the front passenger side
was left alone.

The belt was tensioned with the right tool.  I was able to
convince my mechanic to come over and do this for me.  I was very
happy when the engine started.

I thought of taking a picture before and should have done so.  However,
the wires did look mirouted from the time I purchased the car.  One
of the thing I did was to buy ne retaining clip for the ignition
wires to ensure that the wire do not sit on the valve cover too much.
Out of 8 retainer, 7 were broken.

I used a torque wrench set at 213 ft. lb wich is the equivalent of
295 Nm as specified.  The leak is not significant as it will put some
oil on the engine block but no drip can be seen under the car.  Weeping
would be a better term for this "leak".
