Peter, I used to have a similar problem on my 86.  If I used the
windshield washer, the intermittent wiper delay would not work anymore. 
After a few days it would have fixed itself, only to stop working again
if I hit the washer.  After some list advice, I tried some switch
cleaner from Radio Shack.  It is normally used for stereo's etc.  I
squirted some into the switch area, moved the lever through all
positions, and have not had a problem since.  The stuff is about $10 I
think, certainly worth a try.  If you need the exact name, let me know,
I'll dig it out.  Does your car have the intensive windshield washer
(little button next to the speed adjust button)?  My car has it, but it
doesn't seem to work.  The wiper move, but nothing squirts out.  I was
just curious to see if it really makes a difference.
