In that case, here goes :)   

I seriously doubt the factory blau has diversity tuning.  The windshields
are probably leftover / what was in stock at build time.  The stock roof
antenna (and the windshield mounted one too) *should* be amplified.  Poor
reception is a common trait of 928's it seems, and this stems from said
antenna amp more than poor tuner specs.  Either that or the antenna isn't
making good contact against the corrosion resistant body/paint.

Note that maybe the previous owner did something wack like using a
T-connector for both antennae - in that case reception would suck for sure.
 As I understand it, the tuner *must* be designed for diversity tuning -
selecting the strongest input from either one or the other antenna and not
both concurrently.

Either way neither stock antennae aren't that fantastic to begin with. 
Maybe you can wire in your own amp.

Cool deck though!  Hows disc tracking in the 928?
