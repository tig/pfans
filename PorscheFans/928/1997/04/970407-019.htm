As is the transmission in a car Renegade may be in a position to talk about
whose engine puts out over 800 bhp. This installation was done after
sufficient research to indicate that slightly moderate use (e.g., apply
power gradually and not go full power all the time) of this large weapon
would not kill the transmission.

Not quite as over-engineered, but strong (comes from M-B) and capable of
being beefed up and protected (e.g., positive fluid cooling) to some
degree. It looks as though you can take the automatic at least into the
400-500 bhp range without having to be so careful.

Ndio, bwana; I nowhere near discouraging you.

Right on. It's just that combination of capabilities that makes 928s
interesting.
