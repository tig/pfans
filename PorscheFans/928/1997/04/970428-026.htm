Cool name!!
Hi Adam, and as for that being "More than I wanted to know" quite the
contrary! I found it rivetting (Though please do not pass this on as I have
an image to uphold!!)

Clearly you are greatly impressed by the suspension, with which I
wholeheartedly concur having just had a set of Eibach uprated, lowered and
progressive springs. The most remarkable aspect of these however was my
initial disappointment on first driving the car! Surprised? Let me explain!
All of my previous cars have had up-rated suspension fitted which without
fail had resulted in the kind of ride quality that keeps chiropractors in
business, a trait I had eventually come to be associated with
lightning-fast handling so you can imagine my disappointment on finding
virtually no difference in ride compliance! The good news however was that
I then found a favourite corner (A real beggar, tightening radius, adverse
camber etc.) and suddenly was brought to the realisation of just what
progressively rated springs have to offer! Anyway the end result is
beautifully taught handling, sharp turn-in and (Fairly!) compliant ride
quality, not to mention having the high speed stability improved no end (At
speeds above 90 she just settles down onto her springs tracks along like a
dream...allegedly!!)

One quick question for you before I go Adam, and one I seem to have asked
countless times here to no apparent avail and that is did you manage to
make a note of the suspension settings (alignment, caster camber etc.)
after fitting? I am having a devil of a job sorting out my geometry and
would be eternally grateful for any adice you might give (Especially as
regards camber as the car feels great though I fear for the life of my
tyres!

Anyway, thanks in advance for any help and thanks for your insight into the
GTS;  it really is a formidiable machine, n'est pas?

Best regards,
