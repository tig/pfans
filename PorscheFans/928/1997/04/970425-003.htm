Axel, thanks. I'll give the cleaner a try sometime next week ... in my 
Abundant Free Time.

Yes, I do have the Intensive Wash Button. Press the button and the wipers 
flail madly but, right, no squirt. So maybe all this is linked together.

Of course, buying a set of tech manuals would no doubt make this an easier 
job. Think I'll use the proceeds from selling my wife's 944 to get the 
manuals ..
<grin>

A few years ago I got a short in one of the heated washer spray heads which 
took down the whole wiper system. This happened in, of all places, 
Stuttgart. I found a Porsche dealer who could diagnose it (this was Friday 
at 1PM and most of the mechanics were already starting out on their 
weekend) and he just disconnected the heater circuit (which was enough that 
the fuse didn't blow any more) and my wife and I drove home to Italy. I'm 
speculating that there may have been a bigger problem than just the bad 
heater which has never been found or corrected. Hmmm. Should be a fun 
project.....
