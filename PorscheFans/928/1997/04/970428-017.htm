Sorry to be dense John but does this mean that if I upgrade the fuses to
suit I can upgrade to 130/ 90W H4 bulbs and 100W H3's, and that if
everything DOES go wrong (God forbid!) it will be the relay that roasts
before I fry the loom? This electrcal stuff is all greek to me I'm afraid!

Thanks in advance!

ps. I have just checked out the Tirerack web-site on your advice and nearly
had a seizure! The price of tyres in the US is unbelievable! A Bridgestone
RE71 in the US circa $160? In the UK try more like 300! Sheesh! All that
and gas at 5 bucks a gallon too...
