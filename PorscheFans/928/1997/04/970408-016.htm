Hopefully with more fuel too :)

Check this out - hold your hand around the flap and advance the throttle -
the vacuum gets strong enough to suck your hand in at high rpm's.  I would
think the high pressure ram air would slip past the flap as the engine
could take it and not be able to peg it open, even if it was sticking out
of the hood.  I mean the air's gotta go somewhere or else it just piles up?
 Doesn't the jetronic system adjust fuel for airflow too?  Maybe I got this
all wrong and need to read that Bosche book!

I think the header install is better hp gain / buck but either would
complement each other very nicely...
