Holy Mole!!!  I brought my ZX-6 to an indicated 150mph for a minute or so,
twice while racing (and outaccelerating) an NSX on ___ freeway.  In
retrospect, I will never do that again.  I have given up bikes / myself as
pilot as too dangerous for my own good.

But it's a feeling that I'll never forget - full tuck position behind the
fairing, knees in!  elbows in!  throttle WFO!  slightly off the saddle,
ever so gently countersteering for turns, WILD wind roaring by my Arai
helmet, glance at the tach below 14k redline check, glance at the side
mirror HA he's still behind me, glance at the speedo HO SHIT 150!!!  Keep
in it - GO GO GO!!!  WWWAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH-RRROOOOMMM!!!

The best parts were slowing down for him to catch up, lining up at around
90mph, seeing him downshift through the drivers window, then nailing the
bike down a gear and basically blowing his doors off again!  The second
time around the NSX even turned off his headlights to assumedly 1. hid from
CHP who'd only see my bike  2. run off my highbeams since I was in front 
and maybe 3. squeek a bit of HP from reduced alternator drag (didn't work
at all  :)

I need a smoke break now,
Phil
