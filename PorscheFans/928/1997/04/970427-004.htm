I have an '86S, and am performing my first timing belt tensioning, and have some 
questions regarding the whole thing.

 1) When you set the $$$ tool on the belt, do you support both slinding shoes 
under the belt, or do you only support the left side and allow the right side 
(the one w/the locking pin) to rest on the air pump bracket.

 2)The manual states that the setting should be 5.0.  How close should I be to 
that figure?

 3)Can anyone explain how the sensors works for the belt tension idiot light on 
the dash?  It appears that the PO had removed the wire that attaches to the 
front of the timing belt cover and grounded it to the engine; but my belt 
tension light came on anyway.

 4)How do I know if my tensioner is working properly.  The rubber boot was 
clean, with no sign of leakage.  I assume that it compensates for engine 
temperature, and engine growth.  Is this something else to worry about? Is there 
anything here to maintain.

Any help is greatly appreciated...  I've had the car about two months, and I 
would be lost without Porschefans.com.   I'm in a rural area.... It is great for 
driving but the population of 928 owners and mechanics is extremely sparse.
