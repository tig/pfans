My-Porsche is a good source for documentation.  I do have doubt that
there 
is a european factory book available.  The factory book, to my knoledge, 
are available only in the USA or maybe North-America, due to a law in
the 
US that forces company to provide anything available to the consummer as 
it is available to the dealer.  If I remember well people in Europe
are not able to get the factory book.  A good reference would be
to obtain an Owner's manual for the car (this should be available
with some research) which should include instruction on your
heating and central lock system.

I am not sure of this but the knob in a Euro model might be for
headlight adjustment.
In the Euro version, they had to include a method to remotly aim the
front
headlight (some european requirement I think).

This is less than $0.02 worth (too much info from memory, the faculty
that
forgets ;-)
