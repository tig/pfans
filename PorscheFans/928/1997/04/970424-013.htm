Hello sports fans:

I thought a brief chronology of my 6 year odessey creating a custom 928
cabrio may hold some mild interest to other 928-ophiles. I bought a
stock 1980 928 in Santa Barbara, California in 1991 from the third
owner. The car was in good shape, with 55K miles and some mild cosmetic
defects. I paid $10K for the car- probably too much in retrospect but
the I got carried away at the mere thought of owning such a fine piece
of german iron. The first three years were spent in mechanical
refurbishment- tranny; clutch; K&N air filters; new injectors etc. That
bought the car up to snuff in terms of running gear, but then the big
decision- take the car to the next level or move on to a new project?

I really liked the car so I began researching a cabrio conversion. After
a great deal of research I picked Newport Car Conversion in Norwalk,
Califoria. They offered a base cabrio conversion with a nonpower top for
$11K. For an extra $3K, they would put in a power top, but you lost the
rear seats. So I went for the base package.

The biggest concern of course was whether they would take a basically
excellent car and ruin it- especially in respects of body rigidity and
handling. Overall, they did a good job. Torsional rigidity was
maintained by means of a steel lattice in the undercarriage. It was well
designed and the weight gain was nominal due to the loss of the top and
glass.  I had new alloys custom chromed (never did care for the phone
dails too much)-  17 inch 5 spoke turbo wheels with P-0's tires. 
The interior was redone in Mercedes vinyl with a custom subwoofer in the
newly fabricated trunk. The only glitch in the entire process was the
paint- Newport did a crappy job and then refused to honor their warranty
to have it redone properly (This is still under discussion and I may
have to go after them formally.  Screwing around with this paint problem
has been the biggest hassle in the entire conversion and this vendor has
been a real weasel about it).

I finished the car by having the entire suspension upgraded to S-4  with
the the 4 piston Bembo calipers and cross driled rotors. I also had B&B
stainless pipes installed in lieu of the cat converter (legal in
Texas!), which substantially transformed the car's handling and
responsiveness. Base BHP is 220 acording to the spec sheet. With the new
pipes and K&N air filter, I surmise an extra 20-30 BHP. The car comes up
on the cam about 4000 RPM with helluva nice growl.

I've always wondered why Porsche never offered a cabrio 928. The lines
are stunning and it is a natural evolution for the car. The upshot is a
gorgeous vehicle that is an eyestopper and much nicer looking than a
factory 944 cabrio with the square rear quarter panel. Plus there is no
substitute for V-8 power.

Would I do it again? Chili Davis did- but he started with an S-4. He's
selling it in Dupont registry for $85K last I saw.

My only regrets have to do with the basic limitations of the 1980
running gear. Short of a full blueprint, there is not much more that I
can do. In the interim, it makes one sweet ride. I've kept every reciept
ever incurred from Day 1, and to date the car has cost me $55K (includes
everything but gas and insurance). Because the cost has been spread out
over 6 years, it has been a do-able project.

Regards,

Richard in Austin, Texas
