The email ID is correct - plus you only need to be a member to RECEIVE the
automated downloads of either the digest or individual msgs.   Anyone
should be able to send at will.

So the short story is that there must be something wrong with your ISP /
POP3 routing or address book.  Try contacting tech support.  If you forward
one of the rejected emails to me, I'll try to look at the header info
also...

In the meantime, you could try manually typing 928@porschefans.com in case
there's something wrong with your address book?  Maybe delete the 928 entry
and re-enter might clear the problem?

How about we try a test too, I'll send you something CC'g the 928 list and
you do a 'reply to all' and see where that takes us...
