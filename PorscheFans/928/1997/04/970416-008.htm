Market valuations are spurious at best.  I can't find a definitive
explanation of the means employed by KBB to fix their values and
adjustments, but let's assume they leverage every means available to the
market.

I question the validity of government records on the sale of any taxable
product -- one can only reasonably assume that, with some degree of
frequency, the sale price of the vehicle will be minimised to reduce the
taxable amount.  I also question statistics on the advertised values and
the average profit margin between wholesale and retail.  One could also
argue that auction prices and reserves are more heavily influenced by
spurious circumstances rather than the individual merits of each car under
the hammer.

Of course, an overriding factor is the condition of each individual
vehicle.  From this perspective I question the devaluation that KBB
attributes to mileage and yet makes _no_ mention whatsoever of the number
of previous owners or the completeness and validity of the service records.
 KBB also ignores the presence or absence of a factory or third party
warranty.  I think it preposterous to have these factors 'included in the
market averages' or otherwise ignored.  These factors should be the primary
criteria for any valuation.

As far as valuation goes, KBB is a reference point and commonly viewed as a
high water mark, not a realistic value for any given vehicle.  I found the
same attitude in Australia for the equivalent article, the Glass Dealer Guide.

As and when KBB includes factors for service history, owners and
warranties, it will become a more factual product.  For now, it's a value
point from which to negotiate and a fool proof guide for the likes car
dealers to avoid making gross errors in judgement.
