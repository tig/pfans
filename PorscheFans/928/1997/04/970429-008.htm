Maybe I missed it - did you change the pads or anything?

Try bleeding the system first (easy solution) before looking
at the components ....

Congrats on the running 928 though!  Is it properly tensioned and
everything?  Must be a feeling of accomplishment to have it running
again!

As far as wiring routing - I think my 87 is different.   I usually 
let the wires tell me by the way they're worn/bent as to how they 
should be routed.  Good idea to get a picture - better one 
to take your own before disassembly though (now you know ;).

RE: the leaky thermo housing - you did the right thing.  There's
always coolant in that area in my car.  When I shopped for the car
I thought it was some kind of problem but all of em seem to have
coolant in that area.  As long as it's not losing coolant I would
think it's OK.

RE: the crank leak

Could be from when you removed that bolt - is it torqued down
sufficiently?  Maybe just snug it up.  Or throw on a new bolt
possibly.
