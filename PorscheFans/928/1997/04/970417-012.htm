paulh-go and have your race and enjoy!  Don't let these other pompous
shi----ds deter you.  If Porsches were meant to be driven only on the
track you wouldn't be having this conversation. Rothmans talks about
being a responsible Porsche performance car driver. Isn't that a bit of
an oxymoron! Poor Kurt--his car has only track shoes.  He probably makes
an appointment to have it polished with a specailly laundered chamois
once a week also.  Folks-get a clue!  Not all of us have a track within
reasonalbe driving distance so we can do the "responsible thing." 
Porsches were meant to be driven fast on the street not just at PCA or
POC events.  By the way, Paul, you're gonna get your ass kicked all over
the place, but good luck and be as careful as possible!
