In retrospect and for the record....
 If you want to change heads, cam towers, timing belt, oil pump seals, water
pump, belt tensioner, front main seal, oil pan gasket and put on some zoomy
headers..... PULL THE MOTOR!!!
Sounds horrible, but this would have been much easier on a rotatable engine
stand with proper lighting.
With that said, I now offer:

If you need specific information, I have the factory 10 volume set of
manuals, and will scan and OCR chunks of information in responce to
precision questions...
There are hundreds of pages here, so please do not ask for "Everything about
32 valve heads" 

If someone gets a web page cranked up I'll consider doing some of the
graphics in the manuals. (Some are really excellent quality)

One more item.  I recently fabricated front sway-bar drop links with
aircraft-type heim joints to replace my worn out rubber drop links.  The
parts to construct a pair ran me $95 and I can repeat this effort easily if
anyone wants a set. I don't know yet if this will add to the handling, but
all the race cars use this type of setup!!

Well! Time to go get wrenching again!!
