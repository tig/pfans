Vince is right but I'm pretty sure you don't have to adjust the timing. 
It's all in the DME. Factory manual says all the distributor does is
distribute the spark - no timing.  (I know this is true for mine and I
believe it's for all 32 valvers at the very least.  The easy way to tell
is that on these, there is allegedly no adjustment possible of the
distributor timing.)

Hi Terry, I have an '83 928S and I don't have any difficulty removing 
any of the plugs.  I'm curious... what's getting in the way on a '78?

My 928S came with Bosch platinum plugs.  I've put over 90K miles on it; 
clean, regap and reuse it four times before replacing.  Each time, it 
performed just like new.
