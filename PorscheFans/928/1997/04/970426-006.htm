Indeed!

After shopping the generic chips, I decided to spend about $400 more than
Autothority's price to get a full custom reprogramming of both computers
(fuel and ignition) with the car on a chassis dyno. This produced:

  - a solid (ca. 50 bhp) power boost from my engine in its exact condition
and state of tune (no two engines are identical, which is why people report
widely varying results from generic chips)

  - much crisper throttle response

  - a torque curve with the shape I wanted (basically the stock curve, just
higher at all rpm > 3000); this would be difficult to get from generic chips

This was the first change I made to my car, and I like it. It produced a
noticeable improvement in "snap", and has not caused any evident problems
in several years of operation. Others on this list have had similar results.

I haven't, on advice of people I trust who told me not to bother.

Would you like to publish your car's list of M codes (the three-digit codes
on the sticker under the mat in the "trunk"? They decode into your car's
exact equipment array.

Enjoy your car!
