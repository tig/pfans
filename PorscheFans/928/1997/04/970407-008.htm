In reference to Phil's note, below, he's right... cruising at 100 MPH with 
a ram air induction system would not guarantee that the air meter would be 
"pegged open."  Instead the air meter would be open only enough to allow 
the amount of air required at that speed...which is cylinder volume times # 
of cylinders times RPM times some factor for the increased density of the 
rammed air. The backpressure from the engine, which can only "gulp" so much 
air in a unit time, would preclude full deflection of the air meter. 

It wouuld seem the biggest problem would be not driving at a constant speed 
but changes when you change the throttle position. Step on the throttle, 
and you'd have a bigger "gulp" of air than the car expects..too lean. Let 
up on the throttle and you'd go overrich. 

You'd probably have to reprogram the chip for optimum performance (duh!).
