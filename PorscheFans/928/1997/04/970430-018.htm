Hi Jim,

Reading this has reminded me that I too suffer from this problem of a
sticking sunroof though in my case the problem manifests whilst closing the
last third or so of the travel. Would you mind also copying me in on your
notes and thoughts on the re-tweaking of this as it sounds like this might
be a good project for me this weekend what with the weather getting warmer
(Well, for England anyway!!) and me still without my aircon.... but thats
another story!!

Thanks in advance.
