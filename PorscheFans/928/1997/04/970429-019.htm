Hi Greg,

I had this problem several years ago and solved it at no cost (except for a
morning's worth of work).

The pulse that the speedo uses to calculate how fast you're going comes from
a sensor on the back of the tranny.  That wire runs up to the back of the
instrument cluster in one of two connectors (I think it's the left hand
one).  The connector plugs into a circuit "foil" on the back of the
instrument housing.  The reason I say "foil" and not circuit "board" is that
it really is a flexible, plastic sort of foil with a set of circuits etched
on it and places for bulbs and instruments to connect.

Well, the speedo has a connector pin that goes into a little connector on
the foil which can get loose or just accumulate dirt and/or oxidation.  At
any rate, when I took my instrument cluster out, I measured the resistance
between the edge connector and the speedo and found 600 ohms.  When I
touched the pin/connector, the resistance dropped to zero.  I simply cleaned
the connector and squeezed it a little, then reassembled and everything has
worked perfectly since.

Now, how to take out the instrument cluster...  It's really easy, but it
helps to have the factory repair manuals as they have superbly detailed
pictures of each step.  The hardest part is getting the steering wheel off.

If you don't have access to a manual, give me a shout and I'll try to
summarize for you.

Good Luck
