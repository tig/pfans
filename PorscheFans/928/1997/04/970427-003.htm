Hiya Phil!

So you're awaiting delivery, huh? Excited yet?! It does sound gorgeous;
Baltic Blue has always been my favorite hue for thse beasts, and linen
leather? Even better! Is it pretty much stock or did Lucky have his guys
"Breath" on it?

>I wish!  But compliments appreciated.  Someone here has like FIVE 928's!!!
>I think I would go into hyperventilation just trying to choose which to
>drive - would need Jim to fabricate one of those wheel of fortune things  :

FIVE!? If it were any other car I might call that greedy but as they are
928's then I'll take it as a sign of taste of biblical proportion! In a
similar position I would require only two; a stripped out 32V road-legal
racer to scare myself with and a second day-to-day car based around a
manual GTS (Baltic Blue natch!) with the full Devek 6 litre engine along
with all of the associated suspension and braking upgrades... ah roll on my
numbers coming up!


>The soon-to-arrive GT is baltic blue (kinda' dark blue bullet lookin'

>I've never seen them before) and most importantly for me, DEVEK Performance
>stickers.  Why so?  It's the President's personal car!!!

Unusual rims? Are they not the 7-spoke alloys similarly fitted to the
Carrera 2's and the 944 turbo's? Personally I think they suit the car very
nicely (Though the GTS's Cup alloys look even better and are 17"!) Is the
car a US or European specification? Anyway, all this talk about your car is
making me insanely jealous!

>Anyways, I am waiting for delivery and will of course report back on this,

Most serious 928? Sorry but I beg to differ! For me that moniker must be
reserved for eiher the ClubSport (Not available on your shores I believe)
or especially the GTS; you've got to love those wheel-arches and I'd
sacrifice a little smoothness for all of that extra torque!

Fantastic! Where can I find some of these bulbs, the main and driving
lamps? They sound just perfect! Do you know of anywhere in southern
california that sells them (928 International?) as I will be back in the US
of A for Independance Day with my beloved and could pick them up while I am
there. Any suggestions?

You bet! Truth be told you'll probably be able to hear it from way over there!!

Happy Porschering!
(928; Never accept second best and get a heater in the bargain!)
