Just about anything with 4 wheels from the early '80's were slugs!

I am wondering how it passed smog / visual alone.  What passenger car came
with a 454 in 1982?  I was under the impression you could swap in a motor
from the like year or newer only, car to car not truck to car, etc.  Oh
well, as long as it works!

I missed the last OBD II tech session and don't know about current checks
but I still don't see how these cars get through.  I spent a small fortune
smogging an SC and it wasn't pretty and I definately never want to go
through that hassle again!

Same here without a doubt.  I wish we all could have two or three - the
project, the keeper, the Rob-special Racer - maybe we all do in just one
928!
