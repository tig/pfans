     To the enlightened few who have discovered one of the finest 
     automobiles on the planet:
     
     I'm looking for repair information from anyone who has had a similar 
     experience:
     
     
     While driving home from work yesterday, my 1982 928 decided it was 
     Christmas time (I am sure that it has cognitive abilities because 
     about every third time I unlock the doors it decides to relock them 
     for me).  Red lights began to blink merrily all across the dash 
     proclaiming "Take me to your dealer who can then charge you $700 for a 
     new master cylinder that you may or may not need - Fa La La La La La." 
     The "brake pressure" light and the two red ! lights continued to blink 
     ominously.  
     
     Of course, all the while, the brakes worked fine.  A quick check of 
     the brake fluid reservoir showed that it is still filled right to the 
     top, as always.  I could find no leaking fluid around any wheel.  The 
     pedal feels fine, and the cars stops whenever I push on it.  Basically 
     what I have is a car that shows no symptoms of brake problems other 
     than the damn flashing !.
     
     My Chilton's manual shows that there are two separate sensors on the 
     bottom of the master cylinder that trigger the brake pressure light.  
     I am curious to know if any of you have had similar symptoms and if it 
     turned out that the problem was a slowly dying master cylinder or if 
     it was just one of these sensors that quit sensing.  
     
     Also, if anyone knows of a good place to buy these sensors that might 
     be helpful.  I've found a place that sells master cylinders for $120 
     which is not too bad considering what I would pay a dealer.  However, 
     I've bled brake systems before and I'm not looking forward to that 
     chore - has anyone used those bleeder tools they sell at auto parts 
     stores?
     
     Thanks for your help,
     
     
     Ed OB

     Hi Everyone!!
   
     I would like to talk to any of the list members about 2 issues 
that I 
     would like some help with.
     
     1. Any information on interfacing with the 928 on board computers. 
 
     
        It should be possible to make a connector so that a lap top     
    
        computer could be hooked up for the purpose of analyzing the    
    
        performance of the motor.
     

The physical connection to the 928's computer is your last worry.  
Chances are that the 928 computer is a serial interface; which mean 
that you can talk to it using a UART chip (e.g. 16450).  You need to 
find out what IEEE interfacing standard it is using.  Then based on 
that standard, determine the software protocol in order to "talk" to 
the 928 brain.  (Hope it's not Burrough bi-sync)  On the laptop side, 
you need to write a low-level driver to poll the serial port; 
preferably by hardware interrupt.  The polling would intercept the 
commands sent via the 928's brain and parse it out, process it and 
display accordingly.  All this is done within your custom-written 
application.

Roughly speaking, and assuming that you have all the technical 
specifications available to do the job, you're dealing with 
approximately 6-12 months of development.

You might want to check the hood latch.  There is a plastic wedge 
(shaped like a quarter-round) that is probably worn.  You can order 
this separately from Porsche and install it yourself.
