Don't forget to retension after 1k miles - should be included..

Add "The best chip is a set of Devek headers" to your shopping list. 
Before you spend your money try to get verification of mfr claims somehow -
dyno sheets, hard data, etc.  The only person I know of that did this by
the book (before/after data) got a true, tailor made chip for HIS
particular car / engine.  

Good luck with your S4!
Phil
