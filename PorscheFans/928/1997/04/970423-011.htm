There are advertisements in Excellence magazine for places that sell all the doc for Porsche.  You should be able to have it and anything else you've lost, replaced.  Also, some mechanics keep entire electronic service histories for each car they service (mine does and the authorised Porsche dealerships are required to do so.)  Your mechanic will also be able to give you copies of his doc as far as service schedules go -- maybe you do the routine services yourself.  This is also something that is available from your regional PCA folks.

.... and possibly a set of heads worth a few thousands, maybe eight 
pistons that cost over $100 a piece...  Well, you get the picture.  :-)

Actually, the cheapest way is to call your dealer and ask.  Assuming 
the call is local... :-)

I'll take another stab at it.. could it be that your fuel tank is not 
venting properly?  That the fuel pumps are creating a vacumn which in 
turn defeating the fuel delivery?  Do you hear a "hiss" sound when you 
release the fuel cap?
