Shock absorbers became 'suspension dampers' years ago.  There have been extraordinary advances in technology, design, materials and related components (tyres, suspension bushes, variable spring rates, light alloy wheels) and the resultant reductions in unsprung weight.

Nevertheless, suspension dampers wear out.  Some would argue that they suffer permanent fatigue (worn valves, expired fluids, depressured chambers) as quickly as your tyres wear out.  Of course, these generalisation pertain to "mortal man's" car -- the average 911 or 928 tyres are hardly likely to run much past 10,000 miles in good condition (at least on the rear.)  So, let's say, your "shocks" are good for at least 10,000 miles (not what you would expect, eh?) and up to, say, 30,000 miles under minimal wear conditions (no heavy loads, no towing, no racing, no bad roads.)


No matter what you've been doing, a car as heavy as the 928 will have completely annihilated its suspension within the first 50,000 miles.  I'd recommends springs, shocks, bushes, sway bars (maybe front only) and have the car weighted and aligned  all round.  I think you'll experience a rewarding improvement in handling.


FYI, I took adjustable Koni's out of a '94 model muscle car (built in Australia, running a 350) after 40,000 _kilometres_ (25,000 miles) and they were dead -- the car was handling reasonably well, but it was definitely 'soft' and I wanted 'hard.'  We pulled the shocks and fitted the replacements (a newer model adjustable Koni if I remember correctly.)  In simple terms, the new stuff was practically rock hard (you could not move the shaft up or down in the catridge) and the old units were very loose (you could easily drive the shaft in the cannister, just by leaning a little - very little - weight on it, whereas the new unit needed sustained pressure of my full body weight to get the shaft to budge.)
