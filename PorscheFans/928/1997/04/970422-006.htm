> But,  how does it compare to a 928? 

I have an 84 928S and I've _crushed_ 2 different 944 Turbo's out of two 
meetings on the freeway. 

> I couldn't find a 928 FAQ so I'm asking.    

Start NetScape and go to http://www.porschefans.com/Archives.html

> Should I just forget it a stick with the 4 banger?

There are more after-market performance enhancements available for the 944.

I hope you're joking about the "2 944S engines stuck together"! 

> Does this mean the maintenance of the 944S x's2?  Say no.  Please.)

Read the FAQ. Make your own assessments. I know nothing about 944 maintenance,
so how can I answer? (rhetorical)


> Are there  any production figures available?
