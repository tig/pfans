All,
I am attempting to upgrade the stereo system that the previous owner
installed in my baby. Luckily he gave me the owners manual to the
unit, so I have the color codes for the wires going to/from the unit.
But I need help with the Porsche stock wiring.

In the process of taking off the side console panel some of the wires
came apart (Word to the wise - wire nuts don't make good long
term connectors in an environment where there is vibration)  So,
here's what I need to know...

There is an 8 wire, wrapped bundle that probably contained the original
wiring to the stock radio.  From these I have been able to determine
some but not all of the wires.  Can someone help with the others?

There appear to be 3 different thicknesses or wire guages. I will
call them Thick, Thin and Med.  This is my present hookup:

Brown Thick:       Ground
Brown Med:         Left Speaker Neg (-)
Red Med:           Left Speaker Pos (+)
Brown w/white Med: Right Speaker Neg (-)
Red w/white Med:   Right Speaker Pos (+)
Red Med:           Ignition switched Power
Red Thin:          ?
White Thin:        ?

I need someone to help me, as the awesome experience of driving the 928
only gets better with a good sound system!

The dimensions that you need is in the shop manual.  Maybe someone with 
a printed version can xerox just those few pages for you.  Forget the 
microfiche version.  the numbers are too hard to read.  Even with a big 
reader.

what my question was, does anyone h e in some manual the dimensions for 
the various parts, such as centerline to each inner frame where the 
fender mounts or know where I may find that imfo.

The price of repair is high unless you're a do-it-yourselfer.  But 
you're still facing high prices for parts alone.  Availability of parts 
is good.  How durable is the 928 you asked?  My '83 928S has 198K on 
the odo and I have yet to touch the engine's internal.  It's slightly 
over-engineered IMHO.  Now... if I can get those !#&*@$% door protector 
strips off the doors I'll be in fat city!

 The concerns I have, of course, are price of repairs, availability
>of parts, and how durable the 928 is.

Thanks to all that responded to my problem of not being able to remove 
the side molding and the rear quarter glass.  Its been VERY helpful.

Here's a few more.. I'm in the process of fully cleaning the interior.  
On the floor board and rear cargo area, I've noticed a thick coat of 
something. (hard, cracked rubber or plastic; used as sound deadener or 
insulation maybe? )  In some areas, it is cracked so bad that pieces of 
it is either missing or worn.  What can I do to revitalize it?  Should 
I remove ALL of them and re-rubberize? (e.g. using an undercoating 
spray?)

On to the carpet and rear seat cushion, a particular adhesive is used 
to glue it down.  Right now, its in a real gooey mess.  What can I use 
to clean it as well as re-gluing it back down?  

Believe it or not, bubble gum was used in one small area!?!  (Well, let 
me put it this way, its pink, stretchy and smells fragrant.)   Is this 
some sort of factory hi-tech adhesive that we've never heard of?
