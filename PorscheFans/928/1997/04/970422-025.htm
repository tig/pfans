Cy,

I bought my 88 S4 about 6 months ago and paid $20k, and it is in about
perfect condition...several folks on this list have seen in and I have been
told by many that it is probably the nicest 928 in Austin.  A friend Elliott
bought a S4 5spd about a year ago and his is also almost perfect and he also
paid $20k.  Seems like from everyone I have talked to the early S4's if they
don't require any work when you get them right away will cost about $20k for
one in above average cond.  I have seen them go as low as $13,750 however...

BTW how it the 300ZX?  I thought about getting a 90-91 300 2+2 instead of the
928 but you see them on every corner!  I hardly ever see another 928...in
fact I see way more 911's than 928.

Cheers,
James Morrison
