I have an '82 928S that I am ready to part with in
anticipation of getting a Boxster.  It is a lovely Red 5sp,
tan interior with 205,000 miles.  Know the best way to
advertise it to find a good new home?

Don't have to adjust the timing on a 32-valvers?  Way cool!  Kurt... 
you're tempting me real bad!!  Is the distributor 'electronic' ?
