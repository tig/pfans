My 85 928 is doing some strange things, and last night I was stranded after
leaving a club from 2 until 5 in the morning (tow truck took 3 hours to
come!).

This is what the car does, I assume they are all related:

1. Erratic performance, while accelerating car cuts out and starts as if it
is getting fuel intermittently.

2. The car cuts out completely, the tach dips down to 0 and the engine
shuts off, and the central warning light comes on.

3. Trouble starting, especially hot starting. It turns over fine, but it
doesn't start. It gets a little blip of fuel and it's about to start but
it's usually a no go.

The car has a new cap and rotor, fuel filter, plugs, etc. I assume this is
a problem with the fuel pump so I ordered a new one today. Does anyone have
any ideas, maybe electrical problem getting power to the fuel pump?

Please help, my car is in the shop again, after I had it for only *two*
days after being in the shop for 2.5 weeks.
