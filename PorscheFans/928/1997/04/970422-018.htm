  Daron (from the U.K. and another participant in this group) would 
  probably be one of the best to answer/research this question.

  There is no central lock button per se, just the round knobs at the
  top rear edge of the doors.  I believe they are electric vs vacuum.

  What do you mean be heat settings?  Being a Euro-spec car, the numerical
  temp values are likely to be in degrees Centigrade, so you'll have to
  do the conversion to get to the Farenheit scale.  The slider knob settings
  next to the fan speed rotary knob are rather cryptic; so cryptic in fact,
  that I can't remember all the different values except that ECO (Economy?)
  means the AC is NOT running and BI(?) does engage the AC.
  
  Sounds like your best be would be to get a hold of an owners manual.  You
  might try http://www.my-porsche.com/ as they seem to have a lot of
  Porsche literature available.  Maybe they can order a Euro-spec manual
  for you.

  The rotary knob should control the speaker fade (front to rear).

The quickest way to find out is to call your local Porsche dealer and 
ask.  By the way, you can get the microfiche version of the shop manual 
for less than $50.  Not including the reader. ($20-$50 used?)
