  Thanks for the info guys.  Now you can see why I was confused on
  this - I was hearing different opinions from other folks I had 
  talked to as well.
  
  John, can I assume that the parts book you're referring to is a
  Porsche OEM parts book (i.e. what the dealers would have)?  Do
  your spacers simply slip over the studs or are they attached in
  a more secure manner.
  
  I ultimately want to upgrade to the rear 8x16 wheels, so I'd hate to
  upgrade to the spacers only to have to ditch them when I eventually
  get the wheels.
