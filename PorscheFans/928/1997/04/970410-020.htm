  My Weltmeister sport springs have arrived!  What are some opinions
  about struts?  I'm using Bilsteins heavy duty struts on two of my 
  other cars and have been very pleased with them.  Does someone have 
  experience with Konis on a 928?  I'm currently running the factory Boge
  units.
  
  I thought I saw some message traffic last week that said the Weltmeister
  sport springs were developed by Kim Crumb and Eibach and that he was
  using a Koni setup during development.  Am I correct?
  
  My car is not a daily driver and it will be seeing some track time around
  Texas World Speedway and autocrosses, so I'm not extremely concerned about
  a "comfortable" ride.
  
  BTW, I'm convinced that Weltmeister is a clandestine organization.
  Automotion sent me the springs in the factory packaging, and there was
  no identification whatsoever as to where the Weltmeister factory is located
  - just plain white boxes with Weltmeister printed on them along with a
  small decal that said the same.  Even their web page has an air of mystery
  to it (http://www.weltmeister.com/).
