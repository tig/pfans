Hi all, 
 This is my first post, so please bear with me if I tend to run on...
I have a '79 Euro 5 speed that I enjoy every time I get behind the wheel.
I have tracked the car at Phoenix International Rway, and found I have racers
blood in me-  The Most Fun You Can Have With Your Clothes on!
The main reason for my post:  Every year, I plan my annual pilgrimage
to Monterey, Ca, for the Historic Races, etc, and was wondering if anyone
else has plans to go there.  It would be cool to see some of the people
who regularly post, and see some of your cars.  Although I haven't before, 
I plan on trailering my car from Tucson and maybe driving the car up PCH 
(too damn hot to drive from Tucson to LA).  I assume that all you guys from 
the SF area might be able to make it, but anyone driving from LA, any interest 
in a 928 caravan?  I did a caravan with 8 Lamborghinis 3 years ago and it was a 
total blast! BTW, I usually reserve a room at the Maraposa Inn in Monterey, but 
that can be subject to change, depending on other room availability !?!
