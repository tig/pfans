They are 16's...  Ok by me because tires are cheaper and Madison keeps
telling me how fast they're gonna' wear out, especially the rears  :)    I
wish I could keep both cars, I just got started on the '84...

They run around $600.  For details in black and white contact
DEV928@aol.com  .  They quote 30hp gain for header equipped 16v engine and
that must be crank not rear wheel measurement, you know?   I know sometimes
I must sound like a Devek nut but let me say no other company knows the 928
as well or backs their products like Devek, plus being all around nice
folks.  Independent dyno tests - Track racing - Road racing - Bench racing
even.  

You are absolutely right about money vs. results if you do not take a
'system' approach - afterall, you/we are trying to better the Porsche
engineers efforts (which started back in 1971 I think).  We, however, have
alot more leeway in regards to noise levels, fuel consumption, emissions
(yipes), modification costs (one car vs. tooling for 1000's), etc.  I'd
start with bringing the car into top-tune shape now and doing a baseline
dyno or track run.

We are also VERY fortunate not to be the first down the performance trail
and can play follow-the-leader to a point.  There are a number of modified
cars on this list and their owners' unbiased, real-world experience is
invaluable.  And the good folks at Devek have done the gamut of modified
928's so their knowledgebase is incredible.  I bet Kim lurks here and I
understand why he couldn't publish an email ID - we'd flood him with
requests!  

If you are serious, then it's time to start your library with back issues
etc. so you can see what's been done already vs. what's available now.   I
took the cautious approach and kept mod's fairly inexpensive but did
improve my car's straight-line performance measureably.  300hp would sure
be nice! (US 1984 928 S 234hp stock)

No complaints here!  This is THE spot for 928 enthusiasts worldwide!

I finally found a place in Marin county that carries that mag!  Pretty fun
reading and seeing all the different ads.  Hope to see your car in there -
owner's report section!


We're long-winded to keep up with our long-legged cars!
