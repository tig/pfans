Thank Porsche AG for that. After designing and introducing on of the best
cars ever, they decided they didn't really like it and left it to waste away.

>The plus side is that I was able to afford one

A big deal! This also leaves room for proper maintenance, which includes
the shop manual (see below)

>I purchased my 88 S4 5 months ago for $16k.

Stick or auto? How many miles? It sounds as though you got quite a deal.

>In a conversation with a dealer

Dealers are usually not reliable sources of information or services.

>out of FLA

Multiply the above by five.

>I was told that '80s 928s are only worth $6-12k.

It's a long way from 1980 to 1989, particularly for 928s. This statement
doesn't meet even the most forgiving test of logic. It also factually nuts,
in that people are clamoring as we speak for GTs, for which they expect to
pay around $30k.

>I suspect he was way off on that ...

....but hey, he's a dealer (see above).

>Does anyone on the list know of repair manuals for the S4?

Yes.

>The only thing I've run across is the $300 comprehensive service shop manual.

That's it, and you should buy it.

>I don't plan on doing anything serious that warrants that level of detail.

Doesn't matter; someone will be doing serious things to your car sooner or
later, and very few shops (let alone dealers) know enough about 928s to
relieve you completely of the responsibility of knowing how the car is put
together and what it takes to perform certain maintenance and repair tasks.

It's also a good way to get to know your car, and this is too good a car
not to take very seriously.

>I'm just looking to find a simple guidebook like the ones "Haynes" puts
>out for all other cars.

They have a book for earlier 928s, but the list is full of complaints about
factual errors and omissions. Serious, buy the shop manual!

>88 928 S4
>86 300ZX Turbo

That's an interesting mix. Want to tell us about it?
