When my cargo cover disintegrated, I took what was left of it to a boat canvas 
maker.  He used the old cover as a pattern and made a new cover out of boat 
canvas.  This was much cheaper than buying a new cover from Porsche -- and 
more durable.  The boat canvas cover has now lasted eight years.  I highly 
recommend it.
