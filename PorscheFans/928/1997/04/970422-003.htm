     LITTLE JESSICA MYDEK IS SEVEN YEARS OLD AND IS SUFFERING FROM 
AN ACUTE AND VERY RARE CASE OF CEREBRAL CARCINOMA. THIS CONDITION 
CAUSES SEVERE MALIGNANT BRAIN TUMORS AND IS A TERMINAL ILLNESS.  THE
DOCTORS HAVE GIVEN HER SIX MONTHS TO LIVE. AS PART OF HER DYING 
WISH, SHE WANTED TO START A CHAIN LETTER TO INFORM PEOPLE OF THIS 
CONDITION AND TO SEND PEOPLE THE MESSAGE TO  LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST AND
ENJOY EVERY MOMENT, A CHANCE THAT SHE WILL NEVER HAVE. FURTHERMORE, THE
AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY AND SEVERAL CORPORATE SPONSORS HAVE AGREED TO
DONATE THREE CENTS TOWARD CONTINUING CANCER RESEARCH FOR EVERY NEW PERSON
THAT GETS FORWARDED THIS MESSAGE.  PLEASE GIVE JESSICA AND ALL CANCER
VICTIMS A CHANCE.  IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS, SEND THEM TO THE AMERICAN
CANCER SOCIETY AT ACS@AOL.COM.

For every new person you forward this to, the American Cancer Society
will donate three cents toward cancer research.  Just make the first
address ACS@aol.com, and then list as many friends and colleagues as you
can.  It's for a good cause, so please don't just delete it.  Thank you.
