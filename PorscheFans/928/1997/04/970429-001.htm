Huh?  I'm having visions of those parking lot attendant commercials with
your car  - wheee!!!  At least offer some coffee!

Kind of a dorky answer and not the one you're looking for right?  On the
one hand I am doubting that any two 928's were routed exactly the same, on
the other hand I'm  thinking that the engineers could have been fanatical
about avoiding cross/misfires and specified exact routing secretly since
it's not in the manual?

FWIW and assuming (hoo boy) you're running good condition wires, they
should have adequate shielding and running them straight next to each
shouldn't be a problem at all.  Anyone else have thoughts on this?

Stop wasting your time and money at that shop!

Ignition timing right?  Is it back to spec now?  I'm a little confused as
to why move the cam gear to reroute wires...

Maybe during the pad install the caliper piston(s) got scored or nicked
when they were retracted and are sticking now?  Or during the bleed, some
grit or particals got lodged causing same?  Something is preloading the
pads - don't let your rotors warp or crack from the heat or this job will
start costing more...

Hmm speaking of warped rotors, were you careful when mounting the rims back
on?  Have heard stories of mis-torqued / mis-aligned rims causing rotor
damage as the brakes heat up with usage...

Good luck - write back with any further info you find!
