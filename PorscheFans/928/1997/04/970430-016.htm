Hi Chris!

Welcome to the best address on the 'net! (Why best? Well everyone you'll
hear from here are some of the friendliest, most helpful, informative and
wittiest you are likely to encounter; and we are all blessed with exquisite
taste!!) Still, enough of that....

I too experienced some problems with my instrument lights some time ago. As
suggested by others in this group I suspect the best place for you to start
looking it a quick "Fiddle" (Sigh! All of this technical jargon!) to see if
you may have poor contact; apparently this area is prone to trouble on
older cars (Though you don't mention the year of your car.) Might be worth
putting a voltage tester across it.

Next place to check is the fuse; do the lights in the binicle switches and
in the clock on the centre console work (these feed from the same fuse). If
none of these lights work then remove the plywood footrest in the passenger
footwell and have a long hard look at fuse number 11 as that may be the
culprit.

If all of the above look ok (As was the case with mine) then stage three is
to remove the little plastic cover under the binacle that surrounds the
rheostats etc. and look around in there for two large multiblock
connectors, one either side of the column. Check that these are all snugged
in (Might be worth taking them  on and off a couple of times to clean (Kind
of!) the contacts.

If this STILL doesn't work then try stage 4; what is stage 4? No idea I'm
afraid as stage three worked beautifully for me and I suspect that this
will also be the case with you; keep us posted!!

Incidentally, how about a few more details about the car (Age, colour,
transmission etc.)? Some of us out here are fascinated by such things...sad
I know but you've got to get your kicks where and when you can!!

>Hi everyone,
