No ISBN that I know of. Some dealers will get these for you, but you should
first check with the mail-order parts houses (e.g., Automotion,
Performance, 928 International, Devek, Tweeks, Imparts, etc.) to see who
has the best combination of price and availability.

By the way, proceed immediately to join the PCA. This will get you
Panorama, which has lost of useful information in both editorial and
advertising forms, including ads from everyone above and many more.

>I just bought my 928 a little over a week ago

Congratulations and best of luck! Lift the mat in the "trunk", note all the
three-character codes, and post them so those of us with magic decoder
rings can tell you what's on your particular car.

This agrees perfectly with my prejudices.
