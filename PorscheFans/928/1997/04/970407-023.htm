Must be catching...

This thread has pretty much been beaten to death recently.  I would say
that if you want more power (and the potential for much more), just get a
later model Turbo (S).  You will not be disappointed with the =
performance,
but you will probably miss the around town response of your S2...  so why
not have both?  I drive my son's car about once a week and I'm still
learning how to cope with it's awesome (chipped) power.  At times it
astounds me how much ground it can cover in such a short time.  It
definitely puts a smile on my face.  I'm not sure an S2 would do that for
me.

Lots of pictures of "curvaceous bodies" would be a good start.
