Pete,

You asked about a sports pipe...I got one out of Panorama for my 88 S4 and
although it did not seem to make a huge difference in the performance but is
sure sounds cool and it was only $125 (that is only for the very last section
of the muffler at the back).  It did save about 20lbs however as the stock
unit is very heavy!

As to the chip issue.  They are located behind the kick panel on the right
side of the passenger foot well.  There are two of them in seperate boxes
both conected to a railing type system that bolts up to the side of the car.
 There are two very large wire bundles that connect into the boxes.  I found
them difficult to get disconnected...then the boxes pretty easy to get out
and the chips easy to get to (Autothority chips come with very good
instructions).  Putting the whole system back together was another story all
together.  I had a very difficult time getting the frame work that the two
boxes are connected to bolted back up to the car and then I had an equally
hard time getting the connectors plugged back in.

As an aside...when I got mine taken apart I was shocked to find chips in it
with Autothority printed on them...I took the old chips out and put the new
ones in anyway (the old ones were marked 1990) and finally got the car back
together.  I am not sure what was wrong with the old ones but they did have
some problem because my car got tons faster...prior to the chip-ectomy I
swear my '95 V8 T-bird was faster than the 928.  That is clearly not the case
anymore.   I also went ahead and put in a K&N air filter since they are not
very expensive.  Now I just need to rig up that switch that Patrick has been
talking about and I will be able to hold 1st gear longer and get a down shift
whenever I want it...with out having to floor it.

Good luck,
James
