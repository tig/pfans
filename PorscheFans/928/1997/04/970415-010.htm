     Hi Everyone!!
     
     I would like to talk to any of the list members about 2 issues that I 
     would like some help with.
     
     1. Any information on interfacing with the 928 on board computers.  
     
        It should be possible to make a connector so that a lap top         
        computer could be hooked up for the purpose of analyzing the        
        performance of the motor.
     
     2. The 4 valve engine cam chains, that connect the intake/exhaust      
        cams, have a oil fed tensioning system.  The tensioners are metal   
        with a plastic shoe or glide on each end.  The plastic shoe is      
        mounted to both halves of the tensioner by screws.  The factory     
        will not sell the shoes as a piece part.  We have to spend a lot of 
        money to buy the whole assembly.  Porsche has to buy the shoes from 
        some supplier, therefore we should be able to find the source and   
        buy our own.  
     
     Any ideas on the above would be helpful to many of us.
     
     
     Thanks,

Check your heater control valve located close to the firewall, just 
below the air filter box.  Assuming that your vacumn system is in 
order, I bet that either it's leaking or the valve is perforated.  You 
need to remove the air filter box; two screws underneath the filter to 
get to it.  Good luck!
