Fellow 928ers,

I joined the 928 listserv a week ago, and I've really enjoyed the
messages and tips.  

A quick thought on the value of 928s ...  It seems odd that such a truly
wonderful automobile doesn't hold its value any better.  The plus side
is that I was able to afford one, but as an owner I sure wish they
received higher regard.  I purchased my 88 S4 5 months ago for $16k.  In
a conversation with a dealer out of FLA recently, I was told that '80s
928s are only worth $6-12k.  I suspect he was way off on that ... but
still.

Does anyone on the list know of repair manuals for the S4?  The only
thing I've run across is the $300 comprehensive service shop manual.  I
don't plan on doing anything serious that warrants that level of detail.
I'm just looking to find a simple guidebook like the ones "Haynes" puts
out for all other cars. 

Thanks.

IMHO, the dealer is right on the money.  It's unfortunate, but I'm not 
complaining since the lower value is the only way I can justify in 
owning one. (or a few more, once I get my priority straightened out..)  
My parts person at the local dealership suggest that hanging on to the 
928 is a good move.  "It'll worth some good money in the future...", he 
said to me... but I don't think so.  Not in my lifetime at least.  It 
is a great car.  Enjoy it while you can.

The only
>thing I've run across is the $300 comprehensive service shop manual. 

There's a microfiche version available for less than $50.
