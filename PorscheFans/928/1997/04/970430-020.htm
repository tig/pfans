Great stuff! Thanks a lot Adam, that'll certainly give me a good place to
start! Your settings tie in pretty well with what I have tended towards on
previous cars with one exception, namely the front caster setting. I have
always been under the impression (Perhaps wrong!) that by reducing the
caster angle to something closer to vertical, thereby making the steering a
little faster at the expense of a slight loss in straight-ahead centering
and a slightly weightier wheel; a compromise I am more than happy to accept
in my quest for razor-sharp turn-in. Any thoughts or experience in this
area Adam?

Also in the quest for "Feel" I have always found tyre choice to be critical
in this area, and in particular sidewall stiffness (Probably less so on 17"
wheels but on my budget I'll stick to 16s!) Can anyone recommend a tyre
with MAXIMUM sidewall stiffness. I've always had a passion for Yokohamas
but with my penchant fo large ammounts of negative camber I simply cannot
afford the wear-rates of these otherwise desirable tyres.

Any suggestions?

Finally Adam as I was driving home from work tonight I was followed for a
while by a graphite coloured GTS. Hoooo boy! How those things look! I
realise it would be a real wrench for you but can I suggest one day
allowing someone else to drive your car while you are a passenger in
another car ahead? You would not believe the PRESENSE the GTS has on a road
(Helped no doubt by being about 6' 2" wide!) If you ever need a volunteer
to drive your car for you (Purely so that you can admire it in motion of
course!) just give me a weeks notice and I'll book the flights!!

Thanks again for the info. and if you speak to Kim Crumb please pass on my
thanks to him too.

Regards,
