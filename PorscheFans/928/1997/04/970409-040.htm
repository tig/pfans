I talked to kim Crumb, the PCA 928 guru, and he told me that my 85
already had this modification.  

From memory:
Prior to 83, there was no roller but only a guide that rubbed on the
belt => a lot of friction.  This was replaced by a roller, I assume
(ASS U ME ;0) that all the model starting in 84 have the roller (my
85 does).
