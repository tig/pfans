  This came off of the Automotion Tech Tip page (hope I'm not violating any
  copyrights!):
  
  
"Mystery 928 coolant leak

If your 928 seems to be losing coolant but you aren't seeing a puddle underneath 
the car, check around the
heater valve. (To see a heater valve, look at part #928.574.573.03 on page 173 
of the current catalog.)

   These valves are known for developing slow leaks, which are evaporated by the 
heat of the engine and
bellhousing before they form a tell-tale puddle.

  To me, this sounds like a master cylinder that is going bad, or if you're
  lucky, old brake fluid that needs to be replaced.  Make sure you're familiar
  with the ultra-high pressures of an ABS system if you decide to tackle either
  of these jobs yourself.
