We were told at a 928 tech session (Northeast Region PCA thing) that
there is a filter in the reservoir. To change the filter, you buy
a new reservoir, list price about $26. It was suggested that it be
changed every 30K miles, as I recall. This may apply only to cars
from '83 on, with the plastic reservoir.
