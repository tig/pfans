Hi guys,

sorry for my tardy response but my mail has been off-line for a few days
being re-configured to a new address (See above) First things first, knobs
by the handbrake.

On the European model there should be TWO knobs. The forward smaller one is
a fader switch for the rear speakers (Probably by-passed if the car is
fitted with a more modern stereo) The other larger switch with the picture
of a headlight is indeed an adjuster to allow the headlamp level to be
adjusted depending on load-state etc. though I have yet to meet or speak to
ANYONE whose switch actually works. Out of interest I believe the switch
works by some sort of self-contained liquid/ hydraulic system.

Next thing; somebody was asking for an ISBN number for the 928 Performance
Portfolio? Well the number is
ISBN 1-85520-269-7, Published by Brookland's Books. If all else fails try
calling CarTech on 800 551 4754

Good luck, it is a very good book and well worth buying. Okay so you may
not learn anything new but it is a fascinating insight into the 20 year
history of this fantastic we all adore.

Happy Porschering!
