     Alan,
     
     Had the same problem after 1 year. Drove the car from New York to 
     Cinti, OH and felt the flat spots go away after about 150 miles.
     Enjoy the ride,
     
     Cheers, George

Greetings to all,
     
I drive an 87 928S4 that has been "resting" for a couple of years. I just 
got the car out of storage and had the timing belt changed and replaced a 
faulty LH brain unit.  The car runs as strong as ever but the brand new 
tires I installed on it 2 years ago have developed some flat spots that 
don't want to go away.  I've driven the car about 50 miles and have tried 
increasing the pressure to round them up, but nothing yet.
     
Any ideas???
     
Thanks,
Alan in Florida
