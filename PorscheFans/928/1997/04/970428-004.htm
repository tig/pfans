You can get them from Tire Rack or from the manufacturer themselves,
among others. The manufacturer is not B. F. Goodrich, however; it
is Michelin/Uniroyal Goodrich. Big manufacturing plant in
Tuscaloosa, Alabama (I don't know if R1's are made there). It
appears that the price is the same no matter where you buy them.
B. F. Goodrich is no longer in the tire business, but the name
lives on.

Incidentally it's not necessary to have race tires when you're
starting driver's ed. Just safe ones that can handle the speeds
you will reach; if you don't already have those on your car you
should get new street tires anyway. It's not as if you will be
competing with anybody, just learning to control the car when
it's closer to the edge than you're used to.
