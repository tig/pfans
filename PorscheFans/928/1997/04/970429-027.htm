Yes, given 130 watts / 12 volts  = 10.83 amps this is a hard and fast rule.
 I don't know how exactly they measured the bulb output but they are
killer!  

Good call,

Subject: no instrument cluster illumination

Hi everyone,
I'm new to the list and would like to introduce myself.  My name is
Chris Trask (if you think I was going to make the same mistake Speed
Racer did you're crazy).  I just bought a 79 928.  India Red and in
great condition.  What a beautiful car!  I'm beginning to experience
some of the enthusiasm that all of you have been enjoying.  I have a 76
MGB that I have restored and always thought was a sports car.  That is
until I drove this car.  What a difference!  Anyway enough gushing.  I
don't have any illumination to my instrument cluster.  When I turn the
key all of my warning lights illuminate, but when driving with the
parking or headlights on I don't have any light to the instrument
cluster.  I checked the fuse and it seems to be okay.  I've looked at
the manuals and it shows that there are 4 bulbs to light the cluster.  I
can't believe that they are all burned out.  Does anybody have any
suggestions?  Also, how do you get a new key cut for the doors and
ignition?

Thanks,
Chris Trask
