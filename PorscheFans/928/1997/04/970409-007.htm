I am new to this list, so pardon any mistakes.

I am looking at a 1987 928 S4, Automatic with 96k miles.  It is listed
for $15995.
I noticed that it is in Kelly Blue Book for between $10-11K.

Can I get a nice 1987 928 S4 for under $15K?
What kind of things should I ask/look for that were inherent problems
with the 1987's, or for this car with 96K miles?

If there is an archive or a FAQ on buying a 928, please let me know.

TIA

You've done everything that I would do in a tuneup.  One recommendation 
though... before you bring it in for emission adjustment, tighten all 
the hose clamps that you can find; especially the hoses that has to do 
with the engine vacumn, intake, etc.  The reason for this is to prevent 
any "false air" that might affect the emission adjustment.  

Don't know what year your 928 is, but I would also replace the hugh 
o-ring (130mm diameter I think..) that is between the air mass meter 
and the air plenum.  Cost about $10 from Automotion.  This area is 
another source of "false air"; causes rough idling at times and hard to 
diagnose.

On a different subject, does any one know of a cheap source for a 
three-gas analyzer?  (ok, I know... not cheap.)
