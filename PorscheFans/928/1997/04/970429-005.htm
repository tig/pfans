1.  Headlamp adjuster.  In Euro cars, the second knob is the headlamp
adjuster, as noted earlier.  If your car has been "Federalized" with US head
lamps, the adjuster will not work.  At the back of the lamp (in Euro lamps)
there is a socket for the adjuster ram to fit into.  Not on US lamps (we
don't trust our fair citizens with such a complex and legally important task
such as headlamp adjustment).

2.  Intensive windscreen wash.  The second tank is in the very front of the
car on the starboard side.  The special silicone remover solution is
available only at Porsche dealers and is unbelievably expensive.  It does,
however, really get the scum off the windscreen left by the soft rubber
wipers.  You will almost certainly discover that the hoses for this system
are nonop.  I cannot even begin to recall the number of times I had that
system put right on my 84.  The GTS doesn't have this failure prone system
(of course, we have the failure prone tire inflation sensor system in its
place).  The failure usually occurs at the point where the two systems merge,
which is just under the starboard washer nossle on the hood.  When it works,
however, it is great stuff.
