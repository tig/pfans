I had one installed about two years ago.

I don't know. For what it's worth, my car's belt has not been showing the
kind of edge wear supposed to be reduced by this part, but I don't know
that it had previously been wearing in this way. I assumed that if Porsche
saw fit to make these changes, I'd benefit from them.

Remember meanwhile that, this part notwithstanding, new belts need new
rollers to fit the new belt's profile, and that tensioner get old and
should be replaced now and then.
