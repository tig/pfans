Hi gang and a special hi to Phil!

Any man who owns TWO 928's (Even for only a few days) is clearly a GOD!
Tell us more, Phil! What colour is it? Leather? Photo's forthcoming I
presume?

You were asking about CD tracking in the 928. I've got a Pioneer CD player
in mine and the damn thing leaps all over the place on standard suspension;
needless to say the CD and my new Eibach setup detest each other! If as I
believe to be the case the GT has up-rated suspension then try for yourself
though I suspect the best route to digital audio is going to be a remote
mounted multi-changer with the associated improved vibration damping. The
other alternative of course is DAT, but then you sacrifice some of the
flexibility of the CD. Ahh... choices choices.

As for intensive washer systems; Yup on pre S4 model the intensive wash
tank is next to the bonnet catch but I believe on the 32 valve models there
is some kind of black electronicy-looking box in it's place, moving the
intensive wash to who knows where. If anyone ever fancies attacking the
pipework for the various washers then I would recommend buying the
Euroselect Parts Manual (I got mine from 928 International) which has a
great (Though intimidating!) diagram of the full extent of all of that
pipework!

 Finally Phil, do you know if standard wiring can cope with the extra
ampage of Hi-wattage (100W Full and 60W Dip) bulbs? I believe you run them
on your pide-and-joy and I'd love to know if you needed additional relays
in there somewhere...

Anyway time to go; I am meeting one of our company's stainless steel
fabricators to begin work on my new custom stainless rear exhaust box! Just
wait 'til that gets fitted, it'll sound like the four horsemen of the
apocalyse!

Happy Porschering (Go V8 or Go Home!)
