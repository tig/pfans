    I'd like to clarify/correct my previous message.  I should of checked a bit more instead on trying to 
simply rely on recollection.  First, DEVEK's coilover package is adjustable for height, so i imagine you can 
retain your original ride height while firming up ride and handling.  Secondly, the un-sprung mass reduction 
is 15 lbs total at the front, compared to the stock set-up.  Rear units weigh 14 lbs each.  Front springs are 
rated at 600 lb and the rear's at 400lb, non-progreessive, but custom spring rates are available.

  As for Automotion; they call out progressive, 400-580lb fronts, and 300-350  rear springs.  If you get the 
height adjustment kit(required for 78-'84 models), i suppose you could also adjust them to retain stock ride 
height.
