Amazing. I was noticing quite a few postings from people in Austin, TX.
Some of these were responses to a posting I made describing the taming of
the Lotus Elan. [Subject: Squiditis] I gathered e-mail addresses and started
verifying that these 928 owners were indeed from Austin. 

On Friday, April 11th, I extended a proposal that we all meet on Sunday, April
13th on the top level of a parking garage in north Austin between 6 and 7 PM. 
It was a very short notice, but a most rewarding sight as each of eight 928s
came up that last ramp to the top level! You could hear these cars comming up,
and that exhaust sound, in of itself, perked the ears of all not unlike a
bird-dog honing in. 

There were eight 928s and one M3 (forgiven because he _did_ own a 928...it
was just down with a bad head cold). There were more 84s than any other year.
One of these was an exceptional specimen which just made me envious. ;=)
Another was an experimental autocrosser that had undergone several revisions.
There was a green one, a light blue one, a champagne one, two red ones, a
dark blue one, a black one and one that was dark champagne (purple). Of course
I don't have the official names for some of these colors.

Several of us brought cameras and we got some pseudo overhead shots of 7 
cars (one owner had to leave prior to this) by parking on a ramp and shooting
from the level above. At some point in the near future one or more of us will
scan these pictures and put them on some website.

We know that there are more out there in Austin. I think our next get-together
is going to be at a local hot-rod gathering which occurs every Saturday night
in the parkinglot of a strip mall just north of Austin. We'll go in and circle
the wagons! Intimidation.

So, if you have a 928 and live in Austin or anywhere near Austin, then feel
free to join us Saturdays at the Antique Mall at the intersection of I-35 and
exit #250 (FM1325, I think) between 7PM and 10PM (at which time the cops kick
everyone out).
