Dear John,

I stand corrected, my memory remembered the short block weight.  The
block itself weighs 79 pounds.

Complete with oil, intake and exhaust systems, air filters, flywheel,
starter, main electrical cable, power-steering pump and air-conditioning
compressor the BMW M70 engine weighs 529 pounds (220 lbs less than the
Jaguar V12).

The crankshaft (a glorious work of art) is forged, has 12 counterweights
and runs in 7 main bearings.  The rocker arms pivot on hydraulically
positioned pedestals rather than hydraulic lifters - this keeps the
hydraulics out of reciprocating mass for minimal valvetrain inertia.  The
overhead camshafts are driven by a roller chain rather than belts.  Each
bank (60 degrees apart matching natural firing intervals) operates
independently of the other allowing operation on one bank as failsafe.

The 300hp (220 kW) and 332 (450Nm) pounds-feet of torque accelerate the
4233 lb. 750iL to 60mph in 6.9 seconds with an ungoverned top speed of
166 mph.  The rev limiter cuts in after 6300rpm on the stock engine
running on regular unleaded fuel.  Bore is 84mm and stroke 75mm.   The
engine uses dual Bosch LH-Jetronic M1.2 fuel injection computers using
platinum hot-wire airflow sensors.  They are self-diagnosing, have
adaptive idles and Lambda sensors and use throttle motors instead of a
throttle cable. The oil pump is tandem - suction to evacuate the oil pan
(especially under severe cornering/acceleration) and pressure for
circulation.  The oil cooler is thermostatically controlled.  The
symmetrical intake manifolds have twelve equal length runners for
resonance charging into each cylinder.

Enough of all that:  how does it work?  Awesome, with an idle so smooth
its amazing with a mighty whoosh all the way to redline (I've only had it
up to 146mph before I wouldn't look at the speedometer any more).  We
know of examples that are running perfectly at more than 250,000 miles. 
I know of V12s that have been successfully transplanted into smaller BMW
models (six and five series).  My 1990 750iL has returned 14.64 mpg in
two years of driving.
