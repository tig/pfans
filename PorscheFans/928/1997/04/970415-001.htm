I've been a bmw digest member for quite a while longer than I've been a
928 list member.  Periodically we get a post like this over there and it
gets really roasted (this isn't the only one here of late).  Since I'm
relatively new here, I'll try to be civil.

First, what are you thinking?  You've just announced to 500+ people you
intend to go out and break the law doing something that's clearly very
dangerous.

You can't guarantee it will be sparse enough.  What happens if something
goes wrong?  Clearly you planned to do this and the victim's lawyers
will have a field day with you.

Maybe the lawyers will be your coworker's.  Your boss will be really
pleased with the new workplace moral.

Certainly the best thing you can do for your car's performance is to
improve the driver and same for your coworker.  The things I like the
most about driver's ed's events at race tracks are 1) they teach you
you're not fast 2) the race track is the place to go fast 3) you learn a
lot while having a whole lot of fun.  Perhaps you've done lots driver's
ed but I'm guessing you haven't.  (You might be a much faster driver
than me, but who cares, we're both slow.)

Instead, why don't you CHALLENGE him to go to a driver's ed event with
you.  You won't kill anyone, including yourself or your cars and you'll
learn a lot.  (Certainly you'll find out who's fastest there if this is
still really important to you - it'll probably be neither of you.)

Take it to the track,
