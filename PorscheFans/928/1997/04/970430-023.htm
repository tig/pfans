Hello 928 lovers,
I,d previously posted questions and concerns regarding excessive inside front
tire wear on my 87' s-4 5spd. (I think it's due to the inside tire on the
curve going even further negative camber due to the unloading of that side
--- not a toe out problem as has been one diagnosis on this list) I've seen
this question various times but have not seen an answer (ooh this sounds like
a challenge doesn't it?) What are experiences out there regarding optimum
alignment settings--esspecially camber? Manual says
-30' +/- 10'. Has anyone tried the farthest positive setting?(-20') Also does
anyone know of a reputable place in a 1hr. radius of Lexington, Ky. to do a
proper job, beginning with setting the vehicle ride height (preferably
scaling it for equal wheel loads in the process) and ending with a proper
alignment. Oh well, enough of my rambling--oh except I wish I had more garage
space as the 90'GT in June Excellence
should be mine. (somebody's bound to jump on it) Is this the car made
reference to as Fat Albert in a previous post? Fat tires for sure!
Gotta go lexol the interior. 
Thanks in advance for input,
