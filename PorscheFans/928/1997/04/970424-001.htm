About the rotary knob next to the parking brake on Euro 928's:

M. Cameron Plato....Fader control for the stereo...NOT!!  Care to try again?

Cudos to Stephane Chabot...The rotary knob next to the parking brake does
control headlight adjustment!!  Well done.

Anyone who would like the answer to this and many other questions you might
have on 928's should buy the book:  928 Performance Portfolio...it has
nothing to do with making your car faster or handle better.  It does have
almost every article from every car magazine (english speaking) that was
written about the 928 from the day it was introduced through the GTS.  I
believe it is available from Brooklands or MotorBooks or Brooklands
Motorbooks...they have ads in the back of many car magazines.  It is an
awesome book and a great reference for the 928 afficianado!!

Cheers to all.
