Glad this turned out to your liking - I guess the key on the noise
abatement is that you kept the converter and aren't running headers!

Could you quantify loud though on a scale of 1 as stock and 10 an unmuffled
Harley?  I place my car at 2 to 3 with the cat bypass on.  While others
seem to like the sound as early musclecar-like, I kinda' miss the stock
woom-boom resonant quality.

How about your 'quality' of sound - deep, boomy, resonant?  Hollow, nasal,
gutteral?

Any spikes at certain rpm's, sound or powerwise?

Guesses on weight savings / penalties?
