I don'tknow which Eagles you are using, (ST, GS-d, GS-a, GS-c, Gatorbacks, 
etc.) but I have found Goodyears to be too pricey to be cheap tires, and too 
average to be a high end tire. In other words I think their performance isn't 
as high as their price. Some of their tire lines are very old! For bargian 
(~$120 @) tires I like (love) the Dunlop D-40's. They have a stiff sidewall 
and very soft compound. Some may say they are too harsh and wear out too 
quickly, but the performance to dollar ratio is very high. On the other hand, 
the MAX performance tires will be even better, but you will pay for it! ($300+ 
@)  Remember this is only MY .02 worth!

	Also, don't let anyone sway your ultimate decision, I think tire choice is 
purely personal preference. If you are more concerned with noise,  tracking, 
and longevity, then I would pick a harder compound, taller profile tire. To 
research this better, try The Tire Rack web page(tirerack.com). They have 
comparisons and prices, along with everything else you would ever want to know 
about tires, including feeding them. Yes FEEDING them!

Hope this helps,
