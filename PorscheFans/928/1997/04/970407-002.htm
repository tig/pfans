Wise guy answer: look at the pavement behind you; if you see a black
streak (two streaks if you have a limited-slip) it was the tires
spinning.

Somewhat more serious answer: not much back there to squeal like
that. Maybe the noise is actually from the clutch? It is very hard
to accurately locate the source of noises in a car, for me anyway.
You could crawl under the car with a flashlight and look for any
shiny spots where something had rubbed (half-shaft, CV joint,
wheel rim) when the car squats under acceleration, but that would
probably cause thumping rather than squealing. Or maybe the rear
brakes are not retracting from the discs after a stop; can you
cause it by starting up with the brake pedal slightly depressed
(good chance to practice that heel and toe).
