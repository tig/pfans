Thanks for the comments, John. I'm pretty sure it's not from the suspension 
or half-shaft, but I guess brakes or clutch ARE a possibility. I'll have my 
wife jog along side the car for a few miles to see where it's coming from 
(yeah, right!).

I was at an auto parts place and saw this universal filter assembly 
that you can place along the power steering hose and would filter the 
power steering fluid.  Has anyone ever tried using one?  I'm sure there 
has to be some benefit in using it since I don't recollect ever seeing 
a car with one as part of the power steering system.
