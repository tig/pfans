The trouble with guides is that they are like any other survey method: you
have to have a sufficient sample size. Otherwise, a trashed car or private
party sale at an under-reported price will bring the entire market down.

Generally, I find Kelley Blue Book (no relation) only a rough guide.

A '91 GTS isn't exactly collectible, but it may be worth a premium just
because it may be so long before you see another.
