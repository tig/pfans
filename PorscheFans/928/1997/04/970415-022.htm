What's wrong with running our Porsches fast? I would buy a Cadillac if all
I wanted was to cruise around all day. Besides, the road is owned by the
corporation and it loops around the offices and the manufacturing
facilities, and it will be closed that day. This is just a little "event"
at the company picnic, you guys may have gotten the wrong idea from the
post. This isn't some death duel or anything.
