Look in the Excellence Magazine.  There is an outfit that specialize
in putting chev V8 into Porsche.

But, lets think about this...  Why not put one of those new V12
Mercedes engine.  WOuld still be German and it does have a lot
of power...  An I don't think too many people would look down
at a V12 928!!
