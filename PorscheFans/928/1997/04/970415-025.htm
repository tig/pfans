ed,

	yep, my '79 did that exact thing to me about 7 years ago.
to this day, i don't know exactly what caused it, but i bought new
sensors, and a master cylinder rebuilt kit, and rebuilt the MC. when
i took it apart, the two pistons had unscrewed from each other and i
suspect
that that was the problem i rebuilt it, put it back together, and its
worked
fine ever since.

	bleeder tools: yeah, i've used the infamous might-vac, and i
think
it's a piece of shit, as a brake bleeder. a pressure bleeder will cost
no
more, and bleeds brakes much faster and in a much more satisfying
and sure manner. get one.

Well, can't you just run with 4 cylinders only?  After all, that's 
still alot of HP compared to my measly 83!!  Even while your '85 is 
standing still!  :-(
