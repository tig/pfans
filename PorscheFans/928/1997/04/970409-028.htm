No Biggie - I haven't seen the latest flamers digest, now that should be a
good read!

My God, from what you've described this must be the wildest 928 ever, even
considering that supercharged 928.  I am looking at a very innocent looking
picture of my '84 trying to imagine a bad-ass Rat motor under the hood -
what a sleeper that would be!!!  (who would need first gear with a setup
like that!)  (my lousy Yoko 403's would last all of say 2 minutes before
blowing up in the first burnout :)

I would have to get new plates that read TAZS 928  (tazmanian devil)

Phil
ps.
speaking of wild 928's, anyone know what happened to that primered
wide-body that was for sale in Sacto a few months back for $8k ($25k
invested, must sell!)
or
the other wide-body race car in Washington I think it was, owner "over his
head"?
