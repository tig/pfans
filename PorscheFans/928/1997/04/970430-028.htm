Fans:

Like many other 928 drivers, I continue to be disappointed with the amount
of shifter travel required by my transmission (or really the linkage
design). I have noticed  a number of 928PFans asking about "short shift
kits" but, as we all know, there are none available. Further, many of us
have heard about the large gears in the 928 transmission which 'like' the
delay of the long shift. In other words, the long shift is healthy for the
transmission. That said, I still don't like it. Its not that I am constantly
hammering through the gears, I just find the long throws and the tall lever
to detract from the overall driving experience. 

As a result, I have designed a shift lever with modified goemetry and an
overall length that reduces shift travel by approximately 30%. Further, the
shifter can be fabricated to accept either the factory shift knob or an
aftermarket knob. The kit consists of an all 304 stainless steel shift lever
and a Teflon spring plate that matches the shifter bushing locations. The
piece is really a work of art.

I have installed the shifter on my car with positive results. Although the
shifter does not turn the shift feel into that of say a Borg Warner T5 or
T56, it does reduce the throw and lower the actual shift knob for a much
improved feel. Shift effort is increased, but the increase is minimal.
Installation is simple.

If anyone is interested in the kit please respond and we can arrainge a trial.

Steve
