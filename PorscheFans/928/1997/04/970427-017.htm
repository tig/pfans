Hi, I'm new to this list and looking for help.  I've got an '86 928S that I
hit a possum with which cracked the front spoiler and grill.  I got the
parts and and got the old pieces off but I'm having a devil of a time
figuring out how to get the new spoiler on.  Each end of the spoiler, where
it attaches to the front quarterpanels at the wheel well, has three bolts
imbedded in the spoiler that are supposed to be inserted through holes in
the quarterpanel.  They also have shaped lips that are supposed to hook
around the edge of the wheel well.  The rubber just isn't flexible enough to
let me get the screws through the holes in the quarterpanels while at the
same time positioning the lips around the edges of the wheel well.  There
has to be a trick to this.  The factory manages to install these things
without even scratching the paint.  Maybe there is some way to make the
rubber more flexible, temporarily?  Or maybe you are supposed to disassemble
the quarterpanels or something?  Has anyone installed a new front spoiler
who can give me a hint?  Or can anyone recommend a particular bodywork
manual that covers the procedure for this?

I'd appreciate any help,
Dave 
'86 928S
