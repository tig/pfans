James,

  I've had this problem before.  I think the roof gets cocked slightly
  sideways and then jams.  I ended up taking apart the sunroof (but not the 
  motor or cables) and realigning everything and greasing the tracks.
  Beware: our mail-slot sized sunroofs are very deceptive - they weigh
  a heck of a lot for as small as they are.
  
  I recall making some notes in my service manuals about how I dealt with
  this, so give a shout before you dive into it.  BTW, I have the complete
  toolkit, so if the manual opening tool was included, you can borrow it.
  
Jim
