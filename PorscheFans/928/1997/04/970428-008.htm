  I don't have experience with the Comp T/A R1s, but I recall that you
  had to be a member of Team T/A to get them.  I had been a member
  (little or no cost to join) and was getting their newsletter periodically,
  but that has stopped showing up in the mail, so either Team T/A no
  longer exists or they just dropped me from their list.
  
  I have had VERY good experience with the Yoko A008-R on my '84 Supra,
  although that experience has been in autocross conditions vs track 
  conditions.   Their stickability factor is incredible and the sidewall
  is stiff enough that steering response is very quick.
  
  I've been dealing with Tire Rack (http://www.tirerack.com/) for over
  ten years now and would recommend them for good prices and technical 
  knowledge.
  
  Have fun at the driver's school.  After driving at the Texas World 
  Speedway road course, I've realized that you can never fully appreciate
  the 928 until you've driven it on the track.
