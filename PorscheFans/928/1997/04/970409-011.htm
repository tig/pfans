Watch out here!  The 944's and different year 928's use different
sensors.  Most are 3 wire (including mine) so that part # probably won't
do anyone any good.

What I've learned so far (it's a busy week here):
The Ford doesn't seem to work.  My O2 heater resistance (white wires) is
5 ohms whereas most I've measured are 3.8 ohms or so.  Perhaps my heater
is going (hence higher R) but I doubt it.  (Someone could check the
resistance (the closer to 87 the better for me) of their heater.  This
is done without removing the sensor.  Go into front of passenger
footwell, remove the 2 10mm nuts at bottom of fuse box cover and there
should be a wire in a grey casing for the O2 sensor under there.)

Perhaps there is a universal Bosch for our cars - more checking is
required.

Maybe I've figured out where the 2mm angle brackets go on a single disc
clutch.  Hopefully I'll see a pristine flywheel surface tonight!

Best,
Kurt
