  This isn't an answer to your question but it is something to add to the
  discussion.  My '83 doesn't shift as smoothly as I think it should, so
  I brought this up to my mechanic years ago.  He felt that a synthetic
  gear oil (Amsoil, Red Line, etc.) would definately help the situation
  BUT!!! he did not know whether that type of oil was compatible with the 
  synchros and other internals, so he recommended against that solution.  I 
  concurred and have just learned to live with the annoyance.
  
  BTW, I did have him make sure that all adjustments to the clutch were
  within spec just to eliminate the possibility that the clutch wasn't
  fully disengaging.

I had that problem also and found that my clutch pedal was cracked at 
the pivot point.  Took it to a shop and heli-arc'ed it for $10.  That 
eliminated alot of the grinding but there's still some remaining.  
Possibly damaged due to the cracked pedal originally.  Since then, I've 
been toying with the idea of swapping the transaxle with an '85 or '86 
one.
