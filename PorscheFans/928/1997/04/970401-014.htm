not have spacers..

  >>> While at the Zone 1 Tech tacticts  total GT numbers also came up 
since Kim has one exactly like mine.  Total production i believe was 300 
units, of which less than 10(?) are in the U.S.  Since the U.S. is 
Porsche's largest market that 10 doesn't make sense to me, or maybe my 
recollection is just that bad, but if not these sure are small numbers.
