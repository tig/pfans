Sorry if this is a re-post. Number one looked like it bounced.

Brian,

Yes, my car is exactly the same as yours. Yes, I too don't understand why
others have had to re-bend that actuator arm...mine is set correctly.

No, there isn't another switch...unless you do like I've described and ADD
one!

Imagine, if you will, what it would be like if you could push that button 
underneath your gas pedal WITHOUT pushing the gas pedal. The tranny would
electronically downshift. OK, now imagine if you were pushing the gas pedal
about halfway and you could push that button independently. Once again, the
tranny would electronically downshift. Woo hoo! OK, now the kicker. You're
sitting at a stop or traffic light. You push JUST the button and hold it...
not the gas pedal. The light turns green and you're guaranteed to be in 1st. 
You ease into the gas pedal about halfway as you start turning. The engine 
is doing 3500. You're turning hard. You're still in 1st. You're going 20 mph 
and climbing. You mash the gas pedal. You're still in first. You complete the
turn at full throttle. You're heading straight ahead now at full throttle
and the auto jumps to 2nd at 5500 rpm and you blast on down that road.

Now, without the ability to lock the car into 1st (ie. stock), how would you
guarantee you were holding the optimal gear [1st] as you accelerate from
anything under 5 mph around a curve? You'd have to floor it so that the pedal
pushed the button beneath it. Who's going to go faster around a curve (under
these "stop and go" circumstances) ; the guy who floors it from the start
[and ends up sideways as the ass end of the car breaks loose] or the guy that
can "play" the throttle while still being in 1st?

I simply disconnected the button under my gas pedal and Rube Goldeberg'ed a
footswitch to it. This footswitch is over on the left side kickpanel. I just
use my left heel to push this button and it does the electronic kickdown that
the gas pedal button is supposed to do. ADVANTAGE: *I* decide when the down-
shift occurs INDEPENDENT of the gas pedal position. *I* decide when I want it
to stay in 1st up until 5500 rpm, regardless of throttle position.

You know the 928 auto has two modes of downshift. Vacuum will pull it down
one gear only but vacuum AND electronic button together will downshift two
gears. There have been times that I've wanted to floor it yet only drop down
by one gear. Now, with my rig, I can do that. If I want to drop down two gears
I just floor it AND push my left footbutton.

It's all about control.
