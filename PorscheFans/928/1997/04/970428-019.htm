|As for the GTS's suspension reverting to softer settings than the GT you

Oooh, my name in print, well sort of.
Well to start with my background up to 6 yrs ago was all in the UK. I think
the "sports" suspensions for the European market are stiffer than the US on
most cars. I had an '85 944 Man Lux in the UK which I ordered with the
sports package this was definitely stiffer than the US version!
I don't know if the factory puts differing suspension between the US/Europe,
but I ordered my car (don't like this US concept of buying from an existing
selection of imports) with the sports suspension option. It still was a VERY
comfortable ride (so too soft for me). I think the ground clearance from the
factory was 4.25". When I cornered and braked (deliberately), all too often I
would hear the front spoiler grounding! I like to Autocross and on the advice
of Kim Crumb I upgraded to the Automotion springs that Kim had developed. Now I
think it is perfect. I have travelled 600miles (stopping once for petrol/gas)
the freeway ride is smooth, but you can hear the tyres a little more. The
progressive rate ensures no more grounding. The handling/response changed
immensly.

The sports suspension that is installed for the US market probably does improve
handling but it would be difficult to tell without a direct comparison.

Anyway probably more than you wanted to know so I'll stop.

I'm really saying this without looking at the diagram.  If you take 
voltage measurement on these wires in reference to ground, there's a 
good chance that the brown is common, the red is hot at all time and 
the black/blue wire is hot only when the light switch is turned on.  On 
the back of the clock, there should be stamped markings on the 
electrical terminals.  Take this for what its worth.

In my opinion, the relay contacts have to be rated well above the 
current in demand as well as the wires and fuse.

I'm sure everyone on the 928 list agrees, doing it yourself is the only 
(almost) sane way to go.  Welcome to the 928 world!
