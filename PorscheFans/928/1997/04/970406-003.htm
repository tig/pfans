I wouldn't necessarily agree with this.  If you are talking about an S4,
then yes, a DOHC 4-valve engine does seem to offer more *potential* than =
a
simple OHV 2- valve engine.  However, once must keep in mind that the
Chevy V-8 is probably *the* most highly modified engine in history, which
means that there are many, many more performance parts available for
considerably less money than you could find for a 928.  I don't think it
would be that hard to get 400 HP out of a small block Chevy in streetable
trim.

A basic pre S4 engine does not offer more performance potential.  In =
fact,
it most likely has much less.  Just because it has an aluminum block and
SOHC doesn't mean it will produce more power.  One serious problem would
be the lack of any available induction system upgrades for the CIS
injection and the low compression of the US engines.  I think the 928
motor is also heavier.

I do agree that putting in a Chevy V-8 would change the character of the
car, and I would certainly not recommend it in any later model 928.
However, for the owner of an older 928 with perhaps a tired engine, a =
swap
like this could be very cost effective.  Old 928s aren't worth much these
days anyway, so changing the motor wouldn't negatively affect their =
value.
