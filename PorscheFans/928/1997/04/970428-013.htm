Well, the baby is back on the road and I had a big grin on my face.

However, there is always something...

I took the car for its fist spin on Friday night, It felt pretty
go but seems a little sluggish.  But it was late (past midnight) and
I havn't driven the car for soo long that I did not make too much of it.

The next morning, I drive to the Porsche Clinic.  The car definetly
feel sluggish but it is on its way to be inspected by some "experts" 
so I keep on going.  When I get there, I smell something hot.  I assume
it is the new rear pad and do not make most of it.  The people a the
clinic are very well organized and my car goes in the garage right
away.  To my surprize, we are allowed in the garage to observe the
check up and talk with the mechanics.

Well, thing starts going wrong from there.  It appears that my 4 brakes
are dragging and that the wheels are hot.  The Mechanichs at first only
looks surprized and baffled.  At first, I am told that I need a new
brake master cylinder but then I am told that it could be a minor
adjustment on the brake petal.  No attempt is made to correct the 
problem...

They observe that my brake light are not operational, again, no attempt 
to correct the problem and this item is not even mentioned on the 
repair list...

They indicate that my engine is noisy but cannot identify what from.
Their suggestion ranged from a problem in the valve train to a 
problem sith the clutch, again, no mantion of this problem in the repair
list...

I am told that I have a coolant leak on the thermostat housing.  I 
cannot see that leak ($83 to repair, I just replace the thermostat and
the inner and outher O-ring)

I am told that my front crankase seal is leaking,

No one notice that my oil pressure gauge is pegged as soon as the
ignition is turned on.  No one also noticed that my AC compressor
has no belt or is held in place by a pipe clamp (subject for another
long story...)

There was no test drive of the car by any technician, actually, they 
left with the car to get it wash without saying that the inspection
was over, leaving us in the garage...

I also asked the technician on how the ignition wires are supposed to
be routed.  is answer was to find another 85 928 S, take a picure an
do the same on my car...

So, My visit at the clinic was not a good experience.  However, I do not 
blame PCA but Plaza Porcshe.  This has been the fourth time that I have
been
to that dealership and it is the fourth bad experience...

So, I get on the phone to my usual mechanic (3-D cars in St-Louis) and
lucky
for me, they are there.  I explain to them my brake problem and they
tell me
to bring the car over.  They look at the car and, for some unknown
reason, the
brake are now just barely dragging??  They recommend that I flush the
brakes again
and point out in the factory manual the procedure to adjust the brake
pedal.

They then look at the list and confirm that the thermostat housing is
not leaking,
that the crankshaft seal might be leaking but, because it is the front
one, it is not
an alarming thing, just need to check the oil more often. They took the
car for a spin
and thought it ran pretty good.  The only thing is that the timming is a
bit off due
to me moving the camshaft gear in an attempt to reroute some wires...

Well, I am done rambling, if you have any suggestion on the brake
situation, please let me know...
