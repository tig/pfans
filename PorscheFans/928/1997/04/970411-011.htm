  Speaking of rust, I found rust perforation in the bottom of the
  battery compartment on my car.  I guess I didn't see it when I bought my
  car because the undercoating hid it from view on the outside, and
  I didn't pull the battery to check the inside.  I took it to the
  dealer as a claim on the rust perforation warranty since I was still
  within the 7-year window and they told me that that location wasn't
  covered.  After a few letters to PCNA and an inspection by the
  regional warranty rep, they replaced the entire battery compartment
  under warranty - all of this within one month of the expiration date.
  
  Just something for owners of '90 or later cars to keep an eye on.

Jim, I'm curious.. did you do anything special afterward to prevent it 
from happening again?
