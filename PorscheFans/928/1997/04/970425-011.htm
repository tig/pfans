Hold it!  

The reservoir for the intensive wash system is at the nose of the car, in
front of the radiator,  as Stephane indicated!  The two 'tanks' by the hood
are: 1. radiator catch tank  and 2.  normal washer reservoir .  Make sure
you don't get them mixed up as anti-freeze will probably ruin your paint!

The manual indicates exclusive use of a "special silicone remover' cleaning
agent, "contact your Porsche dealer" for the intensive wash system.  

I see their point too (no pun intended :) as one Thanksgiving storm (in a
different car) I had my wipers going full blast for hours.  By the time I
reached the Bay Bridge, the wipers had left much of themselves smeared
across the windshield.  BAD NEWS in a downpour.  WORSE NEWS no intensive
system like in the 928 and who the heck wanted to get out in the rain. 
This was an extreme case and years ago - I hope rubber technology has
progressed since then.

Also FWIW, the first time I pushed my intensive wash button, it
disintegrated and all the pieces popped out!  A quick call to Devek and I
got another.  Whatever fluid was in my tank just spewed about under hood as
the hose was disconnected to begin with.  The wipers did their normal wipe.
  

I have not had time to sort out the wiper hoses - you guys are in for a
real treat here too.  In typical Porsche fashion, there is quite an
elaborate tubing system for the squirters which take into account the two
wash systems, as well as check valves to maintain pressure, and T-fittings
galore.  With only two small holes with which to work with (watch it there)
sorting out the system won't be fun.

Educational maybe, fun not...
