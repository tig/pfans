I see all those ram air, cone type air filter systems everywhere for other
cars, I even put one on my BMW (nice throttle sound, peppier performance),
does anyone make it for the 928? I would like to make as many non-fuel
consumption affecting changes to my car as possible, since I already spend
about $250-400 a month on gas. I called MSDS and he said that they don't
make a system for the 928, and went on to explain why, which I didn't
understand, but I did catch " and by the time you're done you've made half
a supercharger"

Anyone know about these for the 928, or maybe has one installed?
