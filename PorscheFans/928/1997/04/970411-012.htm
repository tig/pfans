  I installed one of those yellow battery mats that are supposed to absorb any
  battery acid that leaks.  Seems to me it cost around $8 and was available
  from quite a few mail-order shops.  I've also been using a Die-Hard
  sealed battery since then and haven't had any problems so far.  The sealed
  type of batteries appear to be less prone to seepage than the type with
  removable filler caps.
