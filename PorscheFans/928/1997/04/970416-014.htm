Greetings, Phil!

Thanks for your reply, sorry it has taken me so long to get backto you but
you know how it is; sometimes there just aren't enough hours! On both your
and Dick Kjellson's advice I now intend to go ahead and join PCA. One
query; do you know which region deals with the area just south of LA?
That's where my girlfriend lives so it seems to be as good a region as any!
On the club front over here in "Blighty" I'm way ahead of you. Im already a
member of PCGB, the 928 Owner's Club and the 924 to 968 Club. Every day
serems to be a joy with some new gem of info popping through the mailbox
about our wonderful cars!

I definitely agree on the quality of "Excellence" magazine; I got a couple
of copies while over there and they really are good; good enough to take
out an international subscription! The other good news is that I'll be back
over there in SoCal.seeing my girlfriend at the end of June so I'll be able
to pick up anything I might have missed. In the meantime I continue to get
our British equivalent "911 and Porsche World" magazine (which,
interestingly enough, I am about to start submitting running reports to.) I
believe this magazine is available there also and though I have to say I
prefer "Excellence" I also believe that you CAN'T get too much of a good
thing (Such as Porsches, power, speed and the like!)

I absolutely agree as regards the racing bugs's  terminal bite! Fortunately
though that particular bug is satisfied by my main pastime (by which I mean
the time when I am not working, sleeping or playing with the 928!) of Yacht
Racing. Nearly as much fun as racing cars but MUCH cheaper owing to my
boss' propensity for paying the bills! (Now if I could only convince him to
start a 928 campaign in the Intermarque Series over here...!)

Sorry to hear about the 70-80 hour week; don't kill yourselves though! I
think it was on these very "Pages" that I saw a great motto;

"You only live once, but if you do it right once is enough."
Words to live by! I don't suppose this new place of yours is anywhere near
Sausolito/ Mill Valley? I totally fell in love with that place and up in
the hills on the other side of the freeway near the look-out to the Golden
Gate Bridge is this loooooong narrow circular tunnel; ideal for taking the
928, winding down the windows, dropping down a gear or two and blast
through (single lane!) at high rpm revelling in the amplified sound of
Weisach's finest (I tried it with a V6 Chrysler Sebring; not an alloy V8
but pretty good anyway!) If you're in the area check it out!

Ever though of leaving a spare set of keys to the porsche at your mother's
place? You never know when the call of those 300 horses (+!) might hit you,
and one shouldn't be stopped by the non-availability of keys! Incidentally,
is that your car in the Devek advert. in Excellence? I noticed your name in
the photo credit and instantly thought "Aha! That must be Phil's beast!"

Final tech. query for you before I depart; front axle toe settings are
listed as being O degrees toe in/ out. Now on previous cars I have tended
to dial in about a degree or so of toe-out to try and reduce the car's
tendency towards understeer (Pardon my swearing!!). Any thoughts on this
and a similar (though less pronounced) version at the back? By the way, for
reference I would heartily recommend the Eibach suspension kit. There is
very little degradation in ride quality (Ah the joy of progressive-rated
springs!) but ye gods what it allows the car to do through corners!
Probably the best $195 I have ever spent, and no doubt there are more
improvements to come with setting up the suspension!

Right, I've rattled on long enough (apologies to those of you currently
thinking "Too long...) so I'll sign off and wish you, Phil and the rest of
the register "Happy Porschering"!

"God rides a Harley.... but when it rains he gets out his GTS and practices
his opposite-lock powerslides!

Best regards,

Daron Townson
1981 928S Auto.
