Hi 5-speed owners,

  I had posted this last Friday (Apr. 4) but didn't see any responses
  (perhaps because the digest didn't get sent that day), so I'm reposting.
  I'm still interested in hearing some thoughts on the questions about the
  torque tube (at the bottom of the message).
  
  Thanks.

  Here's something that could bite 5-speed owners rather unexpectedly:
  
  I had a problem with my 928 S 5-speed last year which left me without
  the capability to change gears.  The problem turned out to be that the
  nylon insert in the ball socket found on the end of the front guide rod of 
  the shifter linkage had become worn and cracked.  As a result, the socket 
  popped off the ball head (located on the top front of the torque tube) and 
  the shifter was left without a pivot point so I couldn't change gears.
  (Actually, I was able to figure out a "limp home" solution by removing
  the shifter boot, and manipulating the rear guide rod until I had
  "permanently" engaged 3rd gear (the best compromise for the 5 miles 
  I had to drive).)
  
  I ordered a new OEM ball socket from 928 Int'l (for half the cost the
  dealer wanted!) and went about the task of replacing the old one.
  For those of you that have not had the opportunity to check the clearance
  between the floorpan and the torque tube, I can tell you that it is probably
  no more than an inch all the way around.  Needless to say, I had to
  do some very tricky maneuvering with my hands, wrenches, extensions, etc.
  to get the job done.
  
  The workshop manuals call for some fairly precise adjustments to the 
  shift linkage, and these are very difficult to accomplish with the 
  linkage still on the car, so I'm hoping that my adjustments were close
  enough.
  
  I had recently submitted a tech tip to Automotion stating that one 
  should spend a few extra dollars and replace the ball socket when replacing
  the clutch since the job is so difficult to do while the torque tube is
  bolted in place.  I now realize that the torque tube is not removed when
  replacing the clutch, so the job may not be any easier to perform at that
  time.
  
  Here's something I was wondering about:  does the driveshaft ride in
  bearings within the torque tube, or is the torque tube simply hollow?
  If the torque tube was hollow, then conceivably it could be unbolted
  from each end and gently lowered (to a point where it almost rests on
  the driveshaft) to gain a bit more clearance.  Believe me, any little
  bit of extra clearance would make the job of replacing the ball socket
  a lot easier.  Also, is the torque tube "pre-loaded" in any way (i.e.
  if the tube were unbolted on each end, would either the engine or
  transmission twist slightly making reinstallation difficult?
  
  Sorry to take up so much bandwidth, but the extra kilobytes will be
  worth it if I can help prevent some other 5-speed owners from getting stuck.
