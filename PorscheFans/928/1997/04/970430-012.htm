You found the instrument light dimmer rheostat, right? On my car
it's under the instrument panel, to the left of the steering wheel.
Also, do any of the controls on the panel (headlight switch, foglight
switch, etc.) light up? What about the clock?

Porsche dealers can get new keys made for you. The bad news is
that it costs about $25. I had mine duplicated by a guy in
Watertown Mass, but it still cost about $25.
