Owners of 928s with the automatic:

Last night I wired up a second footswitch to the kickdown button under the
accelerator pedal. Now I can downshift anytime, regardless of the position
of the gas pedal. I can start off from a stop with my secondary button 
depressed (it's mounted for left foot actuation) and keep the car in first
up until the speed which causes an upshift and I don't have to have the gas
pedal mashed! Now the fun part of this is the "goose it" followed by engine
back-pressure braking. You remember...that snappy lurch manuever? The guys
with the 5-speeds are enjoying that as we speak. It's also fun to have the
car in the right gear prior to "bustin a move". You see a gap, you push the
button and, at just the right time, you goose it and squid on through.

Try it...you'll like it. Here I truly must say "YMMV"
