As an enthusiastic former street racer (Mulholland Drive in LA) I'd
just like to ask you one question: ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND??? Racing
is dangerous enough when done on a closed track with people who've had
some driver training, are wearing the proper gear and don't have to
deal with idiots pulling out of parking lots. Throw in a guy with a
brand new car he's probably never taken above 80 mph and you're
pretty much guaranteed that one of you will ruin the upholstery of a
perfectly good Porsche by getting it all bloody.
