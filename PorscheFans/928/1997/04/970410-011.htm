You are correct to state that a roller guide superceded the friction 
guide.  But I believe Sam is referring to another new design that 
superceded the roller guide design.  I'm trying to recollect, but I 
think this new design has an additional floating roller guide between 
the oil pump and crankshaft length of the timing belt.
