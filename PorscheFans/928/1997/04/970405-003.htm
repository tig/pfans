OK, take it easy on me. I have an 84 S and it's a GREAT car, but...
like many others, I lust for more power. I've been doing research and
have come to the conclusion that it'd take between $7.5K and $15K to make this 
car perform to my level of lust (500 to 600 HP). [Of course the tranny has
to be beefed along w/ this monster motor so I'm really going towards the
$15K end.] 

Why? Why would I do this to my 928? It would be bastardized. And if I'm
going to bastardize it, then why not bastardize it without destroying the
original motor/tranny?

Yank those and put them in storage. Then, drop in a chevy block and an M22.
(Ouch!) Stop throwing rocks at me! Listen...how much does it cost to beef
a chevy? Heck, $2K to $3K will make a monster. 

Someone else in this group eluded to this conversion. Has it been done? If
so, by who?

Hey, I'm just researching all possible venues. I love my 928 and I _should_
just leave it as is. If I did do this swap, would you still be my friend?
