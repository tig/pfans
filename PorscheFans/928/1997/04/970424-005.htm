OK, another beginner question time. But before I do, thanks to the PFan who 
(inadvertently) solved one of the biggest mysteries of 928 life: what is 
the purpose of the rotary knob mounted under the dash under the ignition 
switch in my '86 928 S? Repeated forays through the owner's manual revealed 
a picture of it, but no instructions. Finally about two days ago someone 
mentioned that it's the "wiper speed control." Huzzah! Close enough. 
Experimenting revealed that on my car it is the intermittent wiper delay 
control.

Now the question. Every now and then my intermittent wipers just flat don't 
work. The "constant" stroke works in all 3 speeds, but the "pause" doesn't. 
Also when this condition comes about, the "power wipe" button doesn't work, 
and pulling the wiper control for a wash cycle causes the wipers to flail 
wildly... as if it were on triple-speed. The wash pump does work.

Any ideas where to go next? Do I need spelunking gear to go under the dash?

Pete Jones

Ed, you probably meant to say that one of your fuel pressure regulator 
sprung a leak, right?  Not meant to nit pick... just find that your 
comments are informative and I got confused reading it.

I have an '83 so this is just an uneducated guess.  Sounds like to me 
that you need to replace the wiper control/lever assembly.  It cost 
about $130 for my year.
