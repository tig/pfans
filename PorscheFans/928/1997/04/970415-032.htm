Hello Eric,

I have a few suggestions for your fuel injection problem.

Unfortunately these systems are very hard to troubleshoot for the
symptoms of failure often mimic eachother.

Clean all contacts with a good electrical cleaner. (the brain connector,
all injector connectors, temperature sennsors, etc.)

Also make sure that you have a good ground off your main battery and
that your charging system is working properly.

Check and make sure that there are NO air leaks. ( i.e. cracked hoses by
the air flow meter, intake plenums, aux air regulator, throttle body,
etc.) Air leaks fake out the brain.

Now Ill bet that the brain is working correctly-STOP unplugging it with
the car running. the brain has som ROMs that remember what conditions
the car was in, and where it was(elev.-temp.),these get purged everytime
you disconnect your battery. So dont really mess with it, just clean the
connector.

I would start with the cylinder head temp sensor. measure resistance
values in ohms. check vs. specs. - this is an in-expensive part that
will drive the brain crazy--too hot=too lean, too cool=too rich.
13$appx. cost

Next check that the aux air regulator is working. This lets air bybass
the throttle body during the first few minutes from a cold start. Unplug
one of the hoses-with engine hot, you should not be albe to blow air
thru it-with engine cold, you should be able to blow air thru.

Check throttle position switch-located on throttle body(little black
plastic box). The switch has three positions that change the ele values
going to the brain. Take it off and clean it, its a pretty simple
switch.

Check the fuel injectors resistance values vs. mfg. spec. in Ohms.

Check the fuel pressure regulator( you need a psi meter for this)
s/b around 3 bar i think.

Check cold start injector. it may be leaking, causing extra fuel at
times to come into plenum. unplug connector with engine running and
warm. see what it does when off vs. on.

Finally, when your car is running, wiggle all wires and connectors to
aboved mentioned sensors, and see if the engine misses at all.

It may just be ONE bad connection or ONE bad sensor...

or it may be the Brain or air meter.(big$$$$$)

I wish you luck. (start with the easy cheap stuff first)
