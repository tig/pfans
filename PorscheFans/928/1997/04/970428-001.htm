I just hope I don't have a stroke when the car finally makes it here!  At
least I have all this time to stare at the pictures - believe me I won't be
outside of it much later :)     As far as I know, it's stock although notes
with the dyno sheet indicate "the engine's the strongest we've seen in a
GT".  I am prepared to have my hair set on fire at this point and look
forward to returning to Sears Point.

Funny you should mention this - I do believe Lucky is entertaining offers
on the race car still.  "Fat Albert" is a full-on, wide-body,
rollbar-equipped, race mah-chine.  I don't know if it's undergone the
displacement upgrade yet but that sounds like a fun project to be a part
of.  The price is less than what you'd think for the number of mod's.  Come
on lucky numbers!

These are five spoked like a C2 but the spokes aren't flat, they have a
scooped indentation in them.  Looks like grey/silver paint with clear coat,
very modern/modular looking.  Of course this plays havoc with the
low-pressure warning system but I've gotten used to hitting the <!> cancel
button already with the periodic tail light warning on my '84.   It is a US
spec car.  I love all 928's, especially the 16v cars as they are the
beginning of the series.

Agreed on Club Sport - was thinking of US models.  Wasn't there two Club
Sport iterations, a 'true' Club Sport and a Club Sport version for the UK
only that had the lux items in deference to local buyers?  I recall the
engine being modified from S4 spec's but not having increased output, just
different powerband spreads.  Didn't Porsche revert away from the GT sport
suspension for the GTS, again in deference to buyer wants?  I do dig those
body panels though!  I saw a GTS awhile back with the plates "LCKD IN" -
guess that means the car is NOT for sale ever...

Sometimes you find the neatest stuff in places other people overlook.  In
the H3 & H4 bulb case they can be ordered through JC Whitney!  They do a
ton of importing from all over the world and the lenses came in from
England, the bulbs somewhere in Europe.  I think the box had Italian on it
but forgot exactly.  It was green and orange if that helps.

How about some nice tuned 928 headers to go?
