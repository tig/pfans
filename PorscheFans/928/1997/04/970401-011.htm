Me again,

I am not very familiar with interior upholstery so here goes...

Do you think the upholstery shop will know how to unwarp the bolster
if it is out of the car??

Please let us know what kind of $$ is involved as there is a lot

PS.  One of the solution for this problem is to have your window
	tinted to hide the problem.
