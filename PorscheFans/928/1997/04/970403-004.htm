Every car I have ever seen other than the almost new GTS's needs or has just
had its luggage cover replaced.  I looked into it last Nov and Porsche does
charge almost $1000 for a new one.  An upolstry (sp?) shop here in Austin, TX
told me they would make one for me for $450, and I think it is 928 Intl will
have one put together for you if you supply them with all of your stock
hardware for about $250...I hated all of these options so I bought the
material (about $80 in total) and had my mother in law sew one up for me for
Christmas this past year...It looks as good as stock!!  I know also that the
cover for the '87 is the same as that in a '93, I have an '88S4 and you can
check it out at http://home.earthlink.net/~eamorr.
