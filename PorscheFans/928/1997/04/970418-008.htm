I have never tried the product bu I think it is automotion that
sells stick on padd to prevent pad noise.  Maybe someone else used
such a product.

Thanks for reminding me.  I also think it would be easier on the list 
server and on your fellow members if you just reply to the list server 
instead of cc'ing to the original poster.  I, and I'm sure others get 
redundant posting because of this.  Thanks for your consideration.
