I've had my '79 928 for over 2 years now and the air coming from the side
window vents and the windshield vents has always warmed up the same time as
the engine coolant warmed up.  That's a problem since I'd like to have cool
exterior air without resorting to rolling the window down.  

I've suspected somewhere a water valve isn't completely shut.  By running
the fan full speed I can "cool down" those outlets somewhat, but as soon as
I lower the airflow the air temp goes right back up.  

Today I had the lever/switch/vacuum valve assembly in the center console
changed to make the compressor work and had hopes the rogue warm side air
would be fixed in the process, but no, the sides and top are still warm.
Any ideas where to start checking?

Appropos of nothing written above, my greatest thrill of ownership was
discovering the downshift switch at the bottom of the accelerator pedal and


rebending the actuator arm on the footplate so it kicked in when floored.
Using it will still give me a big smile.

And truly appropos of nothing but perhaps raw luck or a state of grace, this
morning I was commuting down my regular stretch of SoCal freeway and like a
good riverboatman I was moving from one side to another as needed to catch
the swift sections which almost always appear at the same places.  I was
working my way to the right from the number one lane to the inside lane of a
right-handed sweeper which dependably is wide open for a couple dozen car
lengths, when I heard a loud voice outside my closed window say "HEY!".  I
look left, and a motorcycle cop has materialized just outside my side
window, with blue strobe flashing.  He is hailing me over his
siren/loudspeaker and he makes eye contact.  He pulls his hand off the
throttle, holds it out flat and palm down, lowers it a couple of times in a
slow-down gesture, and in his amplified voice continues "RELAX!".  Under the
circumstances that sounded like a terrific idea.  Knowing nothing to say and
having no way to say it if I did, I snapped off the best salute that Boy
Scout training had left me, at which point he goosed his throttle and
squirted away.  Go figure.  I guess that was one of life's Cheap Lessons.  

Anyway, I look forward to thoughts on my warm air blues.
