     Hi Everyone,
     
     I would like to share some experience on the oil around the head 
     gasket issue. 
     
     Due to the extreme cost in doing head gaskets on 4 valve motors, 
     please check very,very, very carefully to be sure that the leak is not 
     from some other source.
     
     1. Front and or rear cam plugs
     2. Cam cover gasket.
     
        Note: I can give detailed instructions on how I did my plugs and    
        cam cover gaskets if anyone is interested.  I can even share the    
        procedure for sealing cam cover so that you can actually get the    
        cover cap screws out with having a disaster. 
     
     Please let me know how I can help.
     
     Historical!!!!
     
     I once rebuilt an 80 928 motor because I found oil in the coolant.  
     After rebuilding the motor, I found that the root cause of the oil 
     leak was a leaking transmission fluid cooler (the cooler is integral 
     with radiator) giving the false impression that engine oil was leaking 
     into the sump.
     
     Thanks,
     
     Don Vellenga
