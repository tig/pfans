Hello Daron:

Panorama is a monthly magazine published by none other than the Porsche
Club of America, PO Box 30100, Alexandria VA  22310  703-922-9300 - by
itself worth the cost of membership ($60? I forgot).  Give them a call and
they should have a listing of all the 'Up-Fixin' volumes available.  The
current volume is vol.X  (10) I think. 

Another great source for info is 'excellence' magazine, 'The Magazine about
Porsche'.  One issue in particular comes to mind - Oct 1995, containing
featured article "A 928 in POC Racing"  (POC - Porsche Owners Club, a LA
based racing club).  Subscription info to excellence, Circulation Dept. PO
Box 1529, Ross CA  94957.  

Does the UK have a Porsche club type of thing?  If so, you might want to
check it out.  If the racing bug does bite don't say I didn't warn you!   

Yes I do live in San Francisco!  Matter of fact, the wife and I were just
patting ourselves on the back on our new home, and lamenting our 70 - 80
hour work week as well (no kidding but comes with the territory running own
business).  

Hmmm.  Your message has inspired me to make the trip cross town to see my
car.  I need to check the cooling system is my excuse (forgot the keys last
time what a dope!).  Plus say hi to my Mom :)

Good luck on the car and don't be a stranger!  
928's Forever!
Phil
