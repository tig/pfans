hallo porsche fans
I got a real big , and strange problem with my 928 s4 .
The car is loosing a lot of power in the mid range, between 4500 and 
6000 rpm. We have tried everything with the car , but nothing helps.
for example, i replaced the sparplugs,, sparkplugwires,,
two distributorcaps and rotors,, also the wires between the bobines
and distributorcaps,, the fuel pump and fuel filter,, but nothing
helps. I messured the recistant ( between plug 3 and 5 ) from the 
air-intake. it was 4.3 ohm so that was oke.
We also tested the electric generator.
The car starts just fine  and runs good to. But if we want to have some 
real action, it won,t go .I still believe that it is an electrical 
problem, because the first time i noticed the problem  i reduced the 
distance from the sparkplugs from 0.7 mm to 0.4 mm.
the problem was gone for a few weeks and than came back.
does anyone know what is wrong with my 928 ? the car is build in 1989
it is an automatic
