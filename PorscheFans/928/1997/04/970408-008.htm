For what it's worth, I just replaced the single-wire O2 sensor in my '83 
944 and it was a breeze. Bosch "universal" sensor comes with a 6" pigtail 
lead. You splice the existing wire on to the pigtail, crimp it down with a 
pair of pliers, and then shrink the included heat-shrink tubing over the 
splice with a hair dryer. Total job time: 20 minutes. Degree of difficulty: 
low. Probability of success: high. Spouse-impressing factor: above average 
(recommendation: cloak 02 sensor with air of techno-mystery).  Total cost: 
$20 and a trip to the parts store. //Pete

I would check the edge connectors on both side of the instrumentation 
cluster at the bottom for good contact.  Clean with an eraser if 
necessary.  Second, I would press tight the rivets on the flexible 
printed circuit "board".  These two areas are known problem with the 
928 instrument gauge.
