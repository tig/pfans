Greetings all,

A quick query for you; I have long considered the dipped-beam headlights on
my 1981 S to be utterly pitiful (Ok, so if I had a Skoda I'd be quite proud
of them but on a 155mph supercar? Oh come on!) Anyway, the obvious solution
is to upgrade the main bulbs from the current 55W dipped/ 60W main that is
strictly speaking the legal maximum on British soil to a more reasonable
80W dipped/ 100W main or even 90/ 130. Now, as I say both of these are
strictly speaking "Illegal" over here for use on public roads but obviously
I only intend to use them for off road use; the same place as I might
consider breaking the national speed limit... yeah right!)

Anyway, the query is a simple one; how much current can the standard wiring
handle TOTALLY RELIABLY? Can I go to the 80/ 100 with a simple bulb change
or will these need a remote-relay hooked into the system, in which case I
may as well go the next step to the 90/ 130's? I have a feeling that this
subject has been raised before so apologise if this is going over old
ground. Call me psychic but I also recall Phil (Hi Phil! How's the Bay
Area!?) having a few thoughts on the subject. The alternative is that I
have been offered a pair of S$ sealed beam units for only $75US, but these
are for LHD and therefore the deflectors would be all wrong and I don't
know if they would even fit.

Anyway, thanks in advance for any advice given, I look forward to hearing
your thoughts!

Best Regards,
Daron Townson
