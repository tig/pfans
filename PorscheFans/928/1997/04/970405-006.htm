Go for it!

I'd be curious to know what approach(es) you've found, but my own research
points to cost numbers at least this high for end results possibly not this
impressive (or should I say lust-slaking?).

>Of course the tranny has to be beefed along w/ this monster motor

Not so. After some problems with fragile gears in the earliest 928 models,
Porsche went seriously to work on the manual gearbox and made it quite
strong. So is the clutch, as long as you don't do rev-up-and-dump-it drag
starts.

In addition, your car has nice weight balance courtesy of the rear-mounted
transaxle, and that's where the gearbox should stay.

Are you done rationalizing yet?

>Yank those and put them in storage.

Per the above, just yank the engine.

Then, drop in a chevy block

It's more than just a drop, but there are well-precedented ways to do this
(see below).

>and an M22

No, keep the 928 transaxle.

>(Ouch!) Stop throwing rocks at me!

From which direction did they come?

And more will make a bigger monster. Unlike 928 hop-up, which has been
almost a blank field and is still pretty rarely done, small-block Chevy
hop-up is a major industry.

>Someone else in this group eluded to this conversion. Has it been done?

Yes, that to which you are alluding has been done a number of times at a
range of levels (toward the top of which is a very tractable, comfortable,
road-going car with over 800 bhp).

>If so, by who?

By whom (my pedant mechanism is on nitrous tonight), you ask? Talk to the
folks at:

Renegade Hybrids
610 Amigos Drive, Unit B
Redlands, CA  92373
(909) 307-2150

>Hey, I'm just researching all possible venues.

I support freedom of investigation; freedom of mutilation is another thing.

>I love my 928 and I _should_just leave it as is.

Sez who(m)?

>If I did do this swap, would you still be my friend?

I'd still take your messages, particularly if you did something interesting
and did it in balanced (e.g., if you're going to make the car much more
powerful, give it much better brakes, wheels, and tires, make sure it has
fully adequate cooling, get some competent instruction so you know what to
do when you suddenly find yourself going much faster than you thought in a
challenging situation, and other boring but responsible stuff like that)
