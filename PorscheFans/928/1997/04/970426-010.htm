Thanks.  We're all special - 928 Fans Rule!

I wish!  But compliments appreciated.  Someone here has like FIVE 928's!!! 
I think I would go into hyperventilation just trying to choose which to
drive - would need Jim to fabricate one of those wheel of fortune things  :
) 

The soon-to-arrive GT is baltic blue (kinda' dark blue bullet lookin'
thing), linen interior, tinted windows, unusual silver rims (C2 style? 
I've never seen them before) and most importantly for me, DEVEK Performance
stickers.  Why so?  It's the President's personal car!!!

Yup, to all Porschephiles who rushed to their phone when Lucky's Panorama
ad broke - sorry but I called first!  (Lucky Ekman = the EK in DEVEK).   
As some of you know, until then I had a tale of woe and despair in my
search for an S4, as it turned out running neck and neck with Sparkes even
finding decent cars.  I almost fell for a black GT at a local broker but
that car more than likely was hiding serious crash damage on the driver's
side.

Anyways, I am waiting for delivery and will of course report back on this,
the 'most serious' of 928s.  I got a recent copy of a dyno test on the car
and the GT REALLY overshadows my '84 but that's not a fair comparison at
all.  Gotta stick up for the 16v engine - mines been bulletproof for 145k!

Is the DAT format impervious to road vibration?  Also, I saw Alpine's new
screen-based control unit - man that's cool and would be even better
stuffed into the 928's glove box...  Wonder if it displays tv too?

I'm running 90/130 H4's !!!  They are some special low-drain bulbs as the
voltmeter doesn't take much of a hit like it does when I crank on the 100
watt H3 fog lamps.  Those H3's must be really inefficient.  The stock
wiring has held up to the task for both.  I wouldn't do any hi-speed night
running without the 130's blazing - they make a huge difference in
visibility!

Please let us know how this turns out.  The sound of the 928 is half the
fun and that stock muffler is half the weight ;)
