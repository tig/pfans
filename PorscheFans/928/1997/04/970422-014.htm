Hello,

		After subscribing to the list for a year or so, I finally bought my 
first water-cooled Porsche.  I have come across a few wierd things.  My 
car is titled as a '79 model.  It is a European S model (5-spd.).  If 
i'm not mistaken, I thought the 928S wasn't in production in Europe 
until '80 (Aug '79 as an '80 model).  Was this a mixup in the clerks 
office or what?  I can't seem to figure this car out.  It doesn't have 
power locks (not that I can find), so I assume that it has vacuum locks?
Also, their is no radiator fan on the front side (this may be normal, 
but I've always seen them with them).  I can't figure out the a/c, it 
does have a compressor so it is there, but there is only heat settings 
on the dash.  Anyone have any ideas?  Also, what does the rotary knob on 
the floor next to the handbrake lever do?  Thanks in advance for any 
knowledge gained.
