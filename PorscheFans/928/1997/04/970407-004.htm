     I have just finished my first week interacting with other 928 owners 
     and other interested parties.  This is great.  I hope to share some of 
     my knowledge and experiences with the group.  I do hope however, to 
     not see a lot of "putting down" of other contributers because of their 
      lack of knowledge on 928 issues. (Re: the response to the fuel 
     filter, for the engine and trans.  The reply was uncalled for and just 
     supportes the image that Porscha owners are snobs.  If someone needs 
     to get some information on these great cars, lets just pass it on.
     
     Hay!!!! Have a great week.
     
     Don Vellenga

I drove a 928 with an 350 chevy in it at one time and it was very 
disappointing.  The guy did it kinda half-ass (want the power but 
didn't want to shell out the $$; should of put in a 427 rat or 454 in 
opinion..)  Besides, even with the 350 iron, it's heavier than the 
original alum engine.  At least it feels that way to me when I was 
driving it.  That throws off the weight geometry overall.  I agree with 
you 100%.  If you're going to bastardize the 928, do it right!

Not sure about still being your friend though... :)

Can anyone tell me how to remove the rear quarter panel glass off  
safety?  (and preferably in one piece?)

My oil pan was leaking profusely at one time and I just retorque the 
bolts.  That did the trick.  Your friend might want to try this first.
