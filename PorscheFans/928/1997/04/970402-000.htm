One design might be to employ a short aluminum pipe, same diameter as the
air inlet to the meter, filter of choice, and then cowl induction type
hood.  This is alot of work/fabrication and maybe better served by swiss
cheesing the stock airbox top, then sealing to aforementioned
induction/hood scoop?  

I don't see any point to running the filter all the way to grill mouth,
might as well leave stock and cut vents/use NACA ducts like on the racing
hoods.

Lots of other cars & bikes see power gains at speed with ram-air - I'm sure
the 928 engine responds as well...
