Dave,

  Thanks for the info.  If you had to do this repair again, would you 
  try to drop down the torque tube to make the job easier, or would that 
  take just as long as doing the contortions required to work around the 
  limited space? I'm hoping that I won't have to replace the ball socket on
  my car for a LONG time, but when I have the $$ to upgrade to a 928GT, 
  I'd be tempted to replace this part right away.
  
  What about "pre-load" on the torque tube?
