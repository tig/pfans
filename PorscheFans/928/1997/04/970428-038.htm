Hi Daron.  Hi Vince.

Some things to consider:
1.  The condition of your wiring loom/harness 
2.  The condition of your battery
3.  The condition of your altenator
4.  The 90w/130w H4 bulbs are low-amp design
5.  It's the 100w H3's (or the combo of H3 + H4's on) that's the real
voltage killer on my car
6.  If I were to do this all over again, I'd skip on the H3's and wire up
mini PIAA's instead (again, low-amp design)

Still wish the lenses were full 8's though,
Phil
