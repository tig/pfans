Hi 298 owners.
My 928 s4 did run dead completly. ( I told you fellows about my problem 
with loosing power.) 
It happend with a speed of 120 mph, it just loost the ignition,but 
the injection kept going and I had big black clouds hanging behind
my car.(unburned fuel) But the fuel was catching fire, and i was still 
running 80 mph,and i tought , there goes my car.
I stopped as fast i could and took the fireextinguisher from the back of 
my car. I could extingguish the fire, but it needs a expensive paintjob.
My car is still in a porschegarage fore the repearing of the engine.
I always try to look positive agains it and and hope that this was 
the problem i was looking fore. ( again a lot of $$$$$$$)
Yes I do a lot of repearing my self, but if the sucker is catching 
fire ( imagine my wife was driving the car alone.) I will let 
expirienced people do the job. 
So you see, when you don't fix the problem and drive on with it ,
you could loose it !!!!.

greetings from HOLLAND
