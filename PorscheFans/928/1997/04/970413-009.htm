Excellence magazine has a back issue with an article on "Autocrossing the
928"...  Therein are all the gory details of tires (back then), springs,
sway bars (6-8 hr rear installs!) and track settings (YMMV!)

I'll try to dig up my copy for the exact date, otherwise, 928 on down to
your Barnes and Noble and check it out!  If you are really, REALLY serious
about racing/autocrossing, then an investment in a tire pyrometer and
making real good friends with your shop mechanic is in order :)

Does Eibach have a website or techline?  Didn't someone just say
Weltmeister has a webpage too?  Maybe there's some useful info there or
email assistance?

BRB,
Phil
