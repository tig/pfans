I can tell you that with SP8000's on, my car is an absolute
disaster in the snow. With narrower, winter tires, as
recommended by Porsche, it would probably be as good as
any other fairly heavy rear-wheel-drive car. Which is
to say, passable but not great. Most winters I've driven
a junker Toyota, but it finally gave out, so I made it
through this winter driving the 928. Not a very good
idea, really. On the other hand, it does produce lots
of interior heat, very quickly, in contrast to certain
air-cooled machines that will go un-named, and with all
the aluminum and galvanized sheet metal rust doesn't seem
to be much of a problem.

The rear seats will hold two small adults for short trips,
if the front seats are not very far back. If their hips
are narrow. Normal baby seats might not fit.

As far as maintenance costs, they are probably comparable
to those of a 911 of the same age. Some things WILL go wrong,
and the pieces to fix them will be expensive, but they are
available, and the quality is what you've come to expect
from Porsche.

I've been driving mine on a daily basis (~100 miles/day) for the past 
seven years before I started the restoration project.  And at that 
time, I allocate anywhere $500-1000 annually for maintenance.  I do all 
the work myself.  It definitely would be much higher otherwise.

(Didn't the factory build a custom 928 station wagon for Dr. Porsche's 
birthday one time? ...hmmm... now all you need to do is just chop off 
the rear hatch and then... )

My brother has an 9__ with an unreliable, rusted heat exchanger.  I 
smerked one cold winter morning when he told me that he's been driving 
around town with a heat bag tucked between his legs.
