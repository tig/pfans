   Hmmm.... I had close to the opposite experience recently with a Sears Die-Hard in my Corrado.  It leaked 
considerably and i ended up replacing it, though not before it dissolved most of the paint on the battery 
support shelf.  Way before this, not long after purchasing my GT, i had to replace a dead battery. In an 
attempt to save some cash i purchased a Die-Hard.  When i got back home i found out out the battery was too 
big,  and no i didn't pull the wrong number of the Die-Hard application chart.  Actually, the same was also 
the case with my Corrado though i hadn't noticed since the shelf will accommodate a slightly larger battery.  
It was the mechanic that pointed this out when he replaced it.  Haven't the people that make batteries for 
SEARS ever used a ruler, or can't they convert from metric to english units?

  Luckily for my Corrado a little paint was the only casualty.  I heard of a case where a leaking battery 
perforated a less fortunate owner's intercooler.  The acid dropped down through the moisture drain holes onto 
the intercooler which sits below it- Ouch.
