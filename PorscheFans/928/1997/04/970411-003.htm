Subject:       Rabbits

The rabbit and the horse were the best of buddies; had known each
other
for years; were about as close as any two woodland creatures could be.
One day they're out playing in the field and the horse falls in a pool
of quicksand. The rabbit seeing this and realizing his lifelong buddy is
in mortal danger knows it falls to him to save his somewhat larger
friend. He spies a farm a short distance away and tells his friend,
"stay very still. I'm going to race to the farmhouse and get a tractor
and pull you out. Upon arriving at the farmhouse he finds no tractor but
there is a Porsche parked out back. The rabbit races back to the
quicksand with the Porsche and pulls his buddy out. Sometime later,
recovered from the trauma of this near death situation, the rabbit and
horse are once again frolicking in the same field. This time the rabbit
falls in the quicksand. Deja vu! "Don't panic",says the horse. "I'll run
to the farmhouse, get the Porsche and pull you out". On arriving at the
farmhouse the horse finds niether tractor OR Porsche. What to do!!!! The
horse quickly devises a new plan. He races back to the quicksand and
straddling the pool tells his friend to grab hold of his dick and he'll
pull him to safety which he then proceeded to do. 
THE MORAL- If you're hung like a horse you don't need a Porsche!!!--
