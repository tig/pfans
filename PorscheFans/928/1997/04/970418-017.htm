Hi P-fans:

I am selling a friend's complete Snap-On tool collection that has been 
used very little. The tools and chests can be sold individually or as 
a set. He is taking offers starting at 20% off of Dealer's net 
pricing. E-mail or call me directly for a list. Snap-On tools are 
considered to be the best available in the trade. Here is an opportunity
to buy them at a discount!

I've been stripping my 928S in preparation of a new paint job.  And I'm 
confronted with a few roadblocks... Any suggestions?

1) How do you remove the rear quarter glass?  Preferably the glass in 
one piece, no exception. :-)  Someone suggested that I cut the rubber 
seal.  Gulp!  I can imagine how much a new replacement seal would cost 
if a single inner window seal is priced "only" at $100.  The interior 
is gutted so I do have access to the glass from the inside.  Just want 
to throw out the question before I start prying.

2) Has anyone successfully removed the side door ding-protector strip?
These suckers feel like they are bolted on from the back... but 
couldn't find any retaining nuts/clips behind the door.

Help!  I'm tempted to use a five-pound sledge hammer and a crowbar if I 
can't find a solution soon!!
