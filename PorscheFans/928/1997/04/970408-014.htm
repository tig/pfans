Good!  Let's include it as stock baseline (heh heh) vs. the stock 305 ci
chevy of the same year - that's what I meant by apples to apples and modify
from there :)  In this regard I'd rather stick with the Porsche engine,
than try to swap in a 'foreign' powerplant.  I just don't think the results
would be worth it, especially when you open the hood, unless it was a
killer small block.

Definately agree.  For ultimate HP bragging rights, the mouse motor surely
surpasses the Porsche V8 - hey it's been raced and breathed on since 1955!

Oh man especially the 928 is so limited for wheels/tire sizes unless you do
some creative bodywork.  Just had a nasty flash - imagine the sound of the
transaxle destructing as you try to do a 5k launch with even 10" slicks -
either that or clutch goes up in acrid smoke  :(

Eet vas jus a yoke Colonel !  Kinda the point too - smog legal hp (mods)
vs. smog legal hp (mods)... year vs. year.

I used to be a diehard bowtie fan myself and thought of 911's as overpriced
VW's.  Well some of 'em still are :)    Anyways, I ended up owning a 911
and will soon have two 928's even so go figure!
