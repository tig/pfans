Present problem: The speedometer reads fine but the odometer is way off. On
a 35 drive
the odometer reads 6 miles. I don't have a clue on this one.  If anyone has
any ideas I'd
really like to hear them. 

Mark,

Here is a note I posted some months ago. I think it may be the answer you need 
.........

You have to remove the instrument cluster cover (often called 'the pod') and
the cluster will come out also with the pod.  


Phil,

I did it! Following your instructions. Thanks! I wanted to investigate a failed 
odometer so I had to remove the instrument cluster completely and dismantle it. 
The removal/dismantling took me two hours (without removing the seat - I could 
not find out how to do it!).

I had no problems except that a couple of plastic bits crumbled from age when 
dismantled. Also in addition to your instructions, don't forget the two 
rheostats for the instrument lights, wiper speed and pushbutton for single wipe 
if removing the pod completely. Rather than disconnect the wiring for these, I 
unscrewed the switches from bottom of the pod after tilting it forward.

The odomteter problem was the double cog wheel which drives the odometer. It is 
a softer brown plastic than the other white cogs and several teeth had been torn 
off. It is easy to replace if I could find one, but no-one sells replacement 
parts for VDO instruments. I finally sent it to VDO in VA and they charged me 
about $65 including postage. They did a good job and also replaced the speedo 
face to show km/hr as a secondary scale (its a long story). The technician even 
took the time to hand write some guidelines on replacing the face again if I 
need to. Highly recommended service.
