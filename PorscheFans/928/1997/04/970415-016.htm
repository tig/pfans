I subscribe to the list on digest and just had to check today's postings on
the web site.  We're 2 weeks past April fools day now, but I wanted to make
sure this wasn't a joke.

Paul:  *ARE YOU F'ING NUTS??!!*
Bill:  Why are you encouraging this?

I won't be nearly as kind as Kurt was to you.  It's guys like you and your
co-worker who give responsible high performance car owners a bad name!  I
expect this attitude from your average 18 yr. old 5.0 Mustang owner, but
would hope for more from people with the good sense and judgement to choose
a fine Porsche such as yours.  Perhaps you both just have more $'s than sense?

If you want to know if your car is faster, better, so forth in a race
setting.  Sorry....you lose.  The new 993's don't have anything near the
handling "issues" that 911's have had a reputation for.  You have similar
horsepower, 993 is lighter, has vastly superior braking capability, lower
weight and probably the same or wider rubber.  If you put both cars on a
racetrack with Hans, Hurley or (name your favorite driver), the 993 will win
every time.

If you want to see who is the better driver... go to a local parking lot
autocross.  If you're half as superior as you think, you will win despite
your hardware "disadvantage".  

If you actually come to your senses and want to learn something about
driving... Join the PCA and attend some Drivers Ed events.  As Porsche
owners, you and your co-worker are both fortunate to have reasonably priced
track time and generally excellent instruction not readily available to your
average bonehead with a fast car.  If you lose the attitude, you will be
warmly welcomed and accepted as a fellow enthusiast.

If you want to wreck a car, lose your liscense, hurt or kill yourself... go
right ahead.  Maybe your boss could videotape the race and we could all see
you on the national news with the report: "A 32 year old father of 2 was
killed today by a speeding Porsche driver engaged in an illegal race with
another Porsche".  We could all say we heard about it first on Porschefans!!

OK,  I feel better now, thanks for letting me vent!

I set my number one cylinder to TDC and install the distributor so that 
the rotor points to the number one spark plug wire.  This will be 
enough to get your 928 fired up so that you can set the actual timing.
