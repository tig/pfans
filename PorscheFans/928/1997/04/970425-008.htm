It's down to $65K.  A JPEG is attached (only to rbeutel) for your viewing
pleasure.  Maybe we
could all get a look at your car?  I saw some nice pics on the Porsche Fans
web page.  But after looking at them, couldn't get back because of a hangup
in the software or links.  Jim- You should post there (I saw you were looking
for a place), but I don't know how, and the email I sent to the webmaster was
never answered.  Phil- does your wife know you have immemorialized her CHP
shame?

Ciao,

Jim, 

You probably think that the hex bolt goes thru the door and into the 
mirror from the inside-out; from a horizontal plane perspective right?  
Well, its not.  The bolt is pretty well hidden.  Stand in front of the 
right-hand mirror and hold it by its side with your hands; left hand on 
left side and right hand on right... now, with your left hand firm on 
the mirror and stationary, push the mirror with your right hand toward 
the front of the car... forward a few inches.  You'll see the hex bolt 
head exposed.  Amazingly, this is the ONLY bolt used to hold down the 
mirror to the door!  I find this to be quite contrary to Porsche's 
over-engineering style!

Anyway, its interesting that you suggested removing the gasket.  Will 
look further into this tonight... Thanks!
