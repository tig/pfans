     Re: Aqualux' request for information on fuel pressure regulators:
     
     There are actually two fuel pressure regulators and one fuel pressure 
     damper on a 928 (at least on my '82).  The unit towards the front of 
     the car dampens the pulses from the fuel pump so that a constant 
     pressure is presented to the system.  The two pressure regulators 
     underneath the air filter assembly are designed to keep proper 
     pressure in the fuel lines as they feed the injectors.  If the 
     pressure is too great, they both return fuel to the fuel tank via 
     lines that run along the passenger side of the engine compartment.  
     On my car, they are connected via vacuum lines which allow them to 
     respond to the acceleration/deceleration state of the engine.  One of 
     my dampers sprung a leak (as in fuel leaking from the fuel side to the 
     vacuum side) so I am about to replace both.  The units for my '82 are 
     available from Vertex auto parts in Florida for $42 each (305) 
     442-2727.
