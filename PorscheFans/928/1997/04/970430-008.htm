Hello and welcome to the group, 

Did you try to adjust the intensity of the instrument cluster light?
On my 85, it is a dial located on the left hand side under the pod.

I am mentioning this because my dial appears to be dirty and, if it
is set at some position, I have no light at all and on other setting
I get illumination.

Hope this helps,
