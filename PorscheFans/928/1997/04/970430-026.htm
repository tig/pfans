Hi all!

Here's the latest problem I could use some advice on...

My 84 928S 5-speed cruise control stopped working some time ago.  I followed
the trouble shooting procedure in the factory manuals and everything checked
out, except for one thing:  the ohm reading from the speed sensor is
supposed to vary from infinity to zero, but the lowest it actually gets is
about 4.5 to 5 ohms.  

Additional data.  The speedo works fine.  The cruise control sometimes works
and sometimes doesn't.  I've coated all the wiring connectors (except the
one on the tranny) with Stabilant-22.  I think my vac is holding OK,
although after the car sits for 5 or 6 days the brake vac booster has lost
its vacuum, so there *is* a small leak, but it doesn't appear to affect
anything during normal operation.  Also, the trouble shooting test including
activating the cruise control mechanism with the engine off, so we were
using stored vacuum at that point.

Has anyone dealt with this problem before?  I'm reluctant to buy an new
cruise control "brain". 

All comments will be appreciated!

TIA

John
'84 928S
