What criteria did the mechanic use to justify his assessment - physical
evidence on the old plugs? And what were they rated to begin with ?   I
have a US '84 928 S and am using Bosch Platinum's WR8'swith no problems on
a real mix of driving - city, freeway, even went drag racing and they look
fine.

Whoa there.  I recall seeing just two plug ranges recommended for the 928's
- the WR7's or the WR8's.   If you are driving in alot of stop-and-go where
the plugs might foul, or, if the car is burning oil then the hotter plug is
better.  If you are constantly running hi-rpms/racing then the cooler plug
is better. Just don't go overboard on the heat ranges or you might have
weird results ie. insulation cracking off in cylinder, plug extending too
far and hitting piston, etc.

These are all generalizations of course and YMMV.  At least plugs are
cheap...

Those ignition systems' claim to deliver higher voltage than stock, and the
wires are supposed to deliver the charge with no loss/no EMI (mostly look
cool).  This is very different than the heat range of a plug - which
specifies how the plug operates and cools using it's ceramic insulator and
also the incoming air/fuel charge as well.  

FWIW, the durability of fine wire platinums were questioned when they first
came out but that's at least a decade ago now and I'm sure there's been
improvement in materials since then.  Even those super expensive SplitFires
were reported to disintegrate (want to buy my used set, only a few hundred
miles on them?).

So after all is said and done, pull your plugs and look at them before you
make any changes.  I don't think a single step up or down in heat range is
going to make as much a difference as which plug you buy.

Let us know how it goes,
PT
