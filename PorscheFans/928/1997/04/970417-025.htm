Oops....forgot about that.... Offer retracted.
I am wondering where the legal line is drawn however.....
If I drew you a picture from memory or told you some torque specs, having
learned said information from the books, is that propriatory also?  You will
note that I asked people to only ask concise questions.  I would never copy
the whole volume, or even large sections, for ANYONE!(even though my dealer
has photocopied many pages for me)
Thanks for the advice!
