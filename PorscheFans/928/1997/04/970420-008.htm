Hi gang,

I'd just like to breifly let you all know about what must be the cheapest
and most effective suspension upgrade on the market. About a month ago
whilst in the US I bought a set of Eibach springs from 928 International.
Now the theory with these is that you fit them to the front of your car
then transplant the fronts onto the rear, the whole system having been
designed to give you about 1.25inches reduction in ride-height as well as a
deceptively large increase in roll stiffness. Why deceptive? Well the
Eibach's are progressive rated (not sure about the original ones now fitted
to the back axle) and so in gentle driving there feels to be little loss in
ride quality, sufficiently little to make me question if I hadn't just
wasted my time and money! Suffice to say the first set of sweeping bends
proved that there is indeed a huge difference to be gained by fitting these
springs in terms of much better "Bite" into the turn and a much flatter,
more stable attitude through it (I had peviously found the car prone to
diagonally pitching and a fair bit of "Squirm" through fast corners, all of
which have disappeared since fitting the new springs.

In addition the car is now incredibly stable at speed and is apparently
unaffected by crosswinds at speeds even at speeds in excess of 100mph (So
I'm told!) though the difference is such that I do now find the car
"Cruises" about 5-10mph faster simply because she feels so much more
stable.

The point of all this? Well the springs cost me just $195! Now that in my
book is a major bargain (Though perhaps one should alos factor in a
complete 4-wheel alignment; I'm still playing with my settings until I get
it set up as I like it which may take a while but will let you know if I
stumble across any demon set-up settings!) So would I recommend this as an
upgrade? You bet! The only slight reservation is that the lower ride height
brings it's own devils and I am considering having an alloy bash-plate
fabricated to protect my darlin' V8 from harm. Other than that I think you
gain A LOT in handling with negligible loss of comfort and for $195 you can
almost "Suck it and see"!

Thanks a lot to Mark Anderson at 928 International (If he had wings I would
swear that place was heaven!)

Happy Porschering,
