Hello All

I thought I'd share a few fixes I've made on my '78 Euro model 928. I wrote
in a
few months ago about a noise I was hearing from the back of the car and how I 
thought it was a CV joint. Well it turned out to be the rear wheel bearing.
I did
change the CV and the noise didn't go away so that left only one thing. I
got a few 
email messages from folks telling me how they had done there wheel
bearings. I 
really didn't want to take the rear suspension apart like a few had done.
Luckily 
European Car Magazine had a tech article on how to change the wheel bearing on
a 911 a couple months ago and I thought that this was the way to do it. I
called
Automotion and ordered the tool for doing this. Unfortunately it was the
tool for
the 911 and not the 928. After many phone calls back and forth I returned
the tool
because they said the 928 bearing removal tool was still a few months away.
After
looking at the bearing removal tool I didn't think it would be to hard to
make one 
of my own. I made a drawing of what I needed and showed it to a friend of mine
who welds for a living. It took a couple days and I had what I needed. It
took about 
an hour to remove and replace the bearing. It worked great. 
Another problem I was having was with the steering. The car would bob and
weave
on bumpy  and uneven roads. I thought the alignment was off so I had that
checked
but everything looked good. It was quite a handful to drive and I was not
looking 
forward to a large bill to replace the steering rack. It had been this way
since I bought
the car but it seemed to be getting worse. The tires were getting a little
worn so I elected
to change them and see what that did. It was a night and day difference.
Now it drives 
like it's on rails. The tires I took off didn't look that bad and I've worn
other sets of
tires a lot further than these but that was the problem. I put a set of
B.F. Goodrich Comp
T/A ZRs on mainly because I could get a killer deal on them. (The tires I
took off were the
same type) 

Present problem: The speedometer reads fine but the odometer is way off. On
a 35 drive
the odometer reads 6 miles. I don't have a clue on this one.  If anyone has
any ideas I'd
really like to hear them. 

See ya
