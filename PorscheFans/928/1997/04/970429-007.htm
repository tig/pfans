Apologies if this is late or already been addressed - I get the
once a day version of Pfans ...

One suspected place is the gold finger contacts on the PWB
for the speedometer.  This requires removing the instrument
cluster which is a few hours work.  It's doable though.

ps - good to see with the good weather we've got quite a 
lot of activity on the list here - just got my baby back
out there today - feels good to be "king of the road"
again! ;)

Check the two edge connectors on the bottom of the instrumentation 
cluster, one on each side.  Clean the contacts if necessary.  If that 
doesn't solve the problem, then you need to remove the cluster and the 
flexible printed circuit board.  You'll see a few rivets close to the 
center of the board.  You need to make sure that these rivets are 
tightly clamped against the copper traces, making a good connection.  
This is a known problem with early 928s.  The plastic printed circuit 
board shrinks given time and eventually will loose the electrical 
connection from the rivets.  Good luck.

work until the car warmed up.  This year it's getting worse.  Does 
anyone have any suggestions on where to look?
