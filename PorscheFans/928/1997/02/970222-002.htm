So Phil Tong's decided to join the exercise club & pump up his left leg &
right arm with a 5-speed 928.  Hans und Franz vill be proud, jah!  Hope you
find a stick as well cared for as your rebinrot '84 auto.

One note from my recent shopping (I bought an '86 5-speed with 94k miles on
Jan. 2):  I was looking for an '80 to '84, mostly for price reasons, but
every 5-speed I tried had some degree of graunch when shifting, from "I
could deal with this if this was the best available, but, jeez..." to
"Scheiss!  I'll just get an auto or a 944!"  This was before I drove the '86
I eventually bought.  What a difference!  While the box and clutch still
require concentration for best results, and second gear becomes much happier
in its work after about 2-to-3 minutes of rolling warm-up, this box requires
deliberate clumsiness before it will complain.

I attribute the vast improvement to the Borg-Warner synchros.  These
replaced the Porsche-style synchromesh starting with the 1985 model year.
My '86 still has the twin-plate clutch (the single plater started with the
'87 S4's), so I think I'm safe in this attribution.

Phil, look for an '85 or later if you're going to stir for yourself!

For what it's worth, it seems that Porsche changed the transmission ratios
just about every year, and final drive ratios almost as frequently.  On my
'86 (2.20 rear end, 1.00:1 5th gear) first seems a bit tall, 2nd way too
short (except when shifting up or down near redline), and third just about
right.  As they say in the small print, your results may vary.  I find
myself going 1->3->4/5 a lot in city driving (poor Corvette drivers, GM
won't let them make this choice for themselves!)

Sidebar: you notice these details when the *$!&#?@%!*&# upshift light is
constantly reminding you how smart it is!  Anybody know how to castrate the
winking devil???
