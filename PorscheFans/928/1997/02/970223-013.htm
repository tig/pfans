:)  Yes, wish me luck in the sale of the 'old car and finding a new one! 
I'm going to try real hard to hold out for an S4 stick this time!!!  It's
going to be hell if I find myself 928-less for a spell...

I'm still having fun with the current car though!  Began work on polishing
the rims tonight.  I wouldn't have believed it works, if I wasn't doing the
work myself!!!   

A.  Easy-off sure did the trick on removing the gold annodizing.  I was
apprehensive at first and did a small test area.  The final 'method' was to
spray the entire wheel, wait 45 minutes, scrub wheel lightly with wire
brush, then rinse off.  The wheel then had a dull, flat silver look to it. 
(THANKS JIM MURPHY for the easy-off tip!!!)

B.  I began applying Eastwood's Tripoli compound with a buffing pad and
1/4" hand drill.  The mirror-like polish became evident right here! 
Followed this with White Rouge compound.  Then Maas paste to remove light
scratches, then Mass finish polish to seal.	The shine is very impressive
now!  Unbelievable compared the old wheel!  



C.  3/4 way through Tripoli on the second wheel, my Dad's trusty drill
started overheating and screeched to a halt.  Poor thing, I think it's
almost as old as I am.  I will polish it later and hang it in Dad's
Workshop.  Anyways, during the whole time using the drill I was thinking
how in the hell did Jim do all those wheels by hand!  Well, I got my chance
to find out didn't I !

D.  Since the Eastwood compounds are almost rock solid, I couldn't just rub
a towel on them and keep going.  Lucky I had those Maas polishes, which are
soft pastes.  It took alot of elbow grease, but wheel #2 turned out just as
nice as #1.  Will have to really check during the daytime.

E.  Dang it I forgot to put some anti-seize on the studs.  A couple were
super hard to remove and I feared busting a stud or something.  They were
way overtorqued and I had to stand on the X-jack literally to pop the nut. 
Total time spent on the two wheels:  4.0 hours.  It should go faster now
that I know what to expect.  Oh yeah, gotta buy another drill!!!

Add polished rims to the list of what's new on this car.  The next owner
had better take of it or I will be PO'd!

Phil
928's FOREVER!!!
