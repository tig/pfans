Lately I've heard a few statements made by my friends about car paint that
I'm not sure I believe, so I'm asking all of you to tell me the truth!

First, do red and silver cars really fade faster than any other colors?  A
friend last week bought a new Honda CRV.  He really liked the silver one,
but instead bought a blue one because he said that the silver would fade in
a couple of years while the blue will be fine for a long time.  He purposely
bought a car in a color he liked less just because of this perceived fading
problem.  Is he right? I would like to know if this is true/untrue for all
new makes, not just for Porsches.  i know that older red cars had serious
paint fade problems, but is this something we still need to worry about?

Also, is it better to wash your car with Soft Water?  One of my friends says
that it is bad because there is salt in the 'soft water' and you don't want
to put salt water on your car.  Another says that 'soft water' is better for
your car than 'regular water' because it has most of the minerals removed
and greatly reduces spotting. Which one is right?


confused by opinions,
jim
