Hi Ton -

Congrats on the GTS purchase!  The GTS is the high water mark as far as
928's go and will go down in history as such.  Don't know much about leaky
racks other than they must be changed at that point - you are very
fortunate to have that warranty coverage !$!

I'm sure you're going to get many replies regarding stereo upgrades.  I did
my own complete install on my '84 928S.  The trials and tribulations are
now buried deep in the 928 list archives so I won't waste bandwidth by
recanting the whole story (sounds of PFans sighing in relief!).  In brief,
if you match the speaker impedances you should be ok but note that Porsche
did some fancy wiring to get all those speakers running off of 2 or 4
channels depending on which head unit/amp you have.
If interested I could send you details direct.

You might want to post an inquiry to Jim Murphy also.  I saw his S4 last
friday night at the SF microbrew get-together and let me tell you (loudly)
that his stereo setup had my hair, watch and jacket sleeves vibrating to
the bass beat!  And yes PFans I actually did volunteer to sit in the back
seat to audition his four 7" ADS subbox!

When you say 'here' where exactly are you?  I don't know where Oman is...  

Welcome to the list!
Phil '84 928S
