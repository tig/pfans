No. Over time, the tensioner loses its ability to tension. If you're lucky,
this will become obvious because it can no longer be adjusted to give
proper tension. Otherwise, it may just give up one day, letting your belt
slip, ruining your day and possibly much of your engine.

The tensioner should be replaced periodically as a precaution.

You and me both.

>Also someone mentioned rechecking tension after a couple thousand miles. 

Do it. A new belt can stretch or fail in its first few thousand miles.
