Before you buy, call Wheel Enhancement (310/836-8908) and talk to Robert
about replica wheels for your car. Some replicas are weaker than others,
and a crack can be fatal. I'm using and enjoying a set of wheels from Wheel
Enhancement with the look you have in mind, and got them at a very
competitive price. You also need to be sure you're getting wheels with the
correct offset for your car, otherwise they may not fit.

Some ultra-performance tires (e.g., the Yokohama A-008P) just don't know
from wet traction. I've gotten very good results from my Michelin Pilot SX
MXX3s, and the Bridgestone S-02 and Continental CZ 91 (which is
considerably less expensive than the other two, and available as part of a
wheels-and-tires- package from Wheel Enhancement) are also good in the wet.
John at Wheel Enhancement is the tire expert with whom to discuss this.

However, no matter which tires you use, remember that you've got a very
powerful car, and levels of acceleration which feel quite ordinary to you
may break loose the rear wheels in the wet and cause the car to fishtail.
