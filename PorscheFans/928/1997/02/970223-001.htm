That's where they put an extra audio amplifier - could that be it?

To figure out whether your car is an S, you could find the engine
type designation. It is located on a horizontal surface, below and
toward the centerline from the connection of the upper radiator
hose to the block. If it's M28.19 or M28.20, it's an S, US model.
If it's M28.11 or M28.12, it's an S, ROW model. Vanilla 928 for
1981 should be M28.15, M28.16, M28.09, or M28.10.

The above is from the technical spec book, which indicates that
there were no 928S chassis numbers for US cars in 1981, but then
gives engine numbers for such cars. Some Teutonic subtlety that
escapes me there.
