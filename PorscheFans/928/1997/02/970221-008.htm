Since the throttle operates by pulling a cable, when you pull the pedal
back you're pushing the cable to no effect. Says to me that you should
check around the throttle body for any hangup. Maybe just cleaning
things up on the outside will fix your problem, since there's a fair
amount of exposed mechanism there.
