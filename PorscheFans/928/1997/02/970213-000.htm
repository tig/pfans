As far as true buy-it, bolt-it-on that's about it.  Once you get into
configuring your own system, that opens up a ton of possibilities.   Hot
Rod magazine (this is a V8 afterall) did a pretty exhaustive study of over
a dozen mufflers for sound quality, fit & finish, etc.  I'll try to find
the exact issue for you.  It was pretty fun to read on the state-of-the-art
street and strip mufflers, as well as enlightening on what's available for
the performance enthusiast.

Some other manufacturers you might check:
FlowMaster
PowerFlow (adjustable)
Walker
SuperTrapp (adjustable)
Edelbrock
Decker Marine (adjustable)

Have fun and if you do go the custom route, let us all know the
configuration you design!
Phil
