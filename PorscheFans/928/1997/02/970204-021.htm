I have been following the thread regarding troubleshooting the rear wipers
and have reached an impass.  

The power to the rear motor is fine, the switch is fine, and the metal jig
that runs the wiper arm is fine and making good contact with the arm.

The arm however does not move when the jig turns, or when I turn it with my
own hand.  Anybody got any info?

Also the remote trunk release operates intermittently.  It works from time
to time, but no pattern has emerged yet.  I did notice that when I was
checking all of the fuses before a long road trip that once they were all
reinstalled everything worked back there for the longest period of time yet.
I don't have a fuse list as of yet, so I haven't taken the trouble to pull
all of them one by one again.  If you are having the same problem or know
what fuse and relay runs the release I would appreciate it.  

Still looking for info on chemically removing any coating on factory flat
face rims before polishing them.

Thanks,
BR
