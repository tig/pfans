Hello All!!!

Just talked to the folks at TireRack.  I asked for some pricing for Borbert
C2 Turbo 17" Wheels.  The folks at TireRack tell me that there are no
problems with them fitting.  Any of you 928-Fans have these wheels? If
so, any problems...

I have been following the discussions about tires and have a couple of
questions.  My 928 is a daily driver, don't Loath me, please ;>)  I only
have a 1.5 mile trip to work.  But, I, as many of you have stated, find that
my 928 doesn't like to drive in rain.  As a matter of fact, the first time that I
was in a serious rain storm, I think that I water skied home.  I have never
hydroplaned that much in a car before!!!  I am looking for good
performance in a Tire, but want to also feel safe when I am driving in the
rain.  What do you suggest?

Thanks for the Advice!!!
