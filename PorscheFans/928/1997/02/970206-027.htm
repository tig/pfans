Hi Rob,
Just read your story about 928 service costs... yikes!

  <snip>
>Labour for above repairs			$1,276.50
  <snip>
>1 Timing belt				225.92

This doesn't help you any, but my timing belt cost $35.00 (and that was the
Porsche price!!!).  If you know ahead of time that you'll need certain
parts, you might try ordering from either 928 International in Anaheim,
California, or Eurasian Parts Select, in Temecula, California.  Both of
these places are EXCELLENT sources of parts and whatever (and no, I don't
have any relationship to either place!).

Now, regarding your rough running car...

  <snip> the engine began to run extremely
>rough.  Like physical shaking.  Terrible to drive, and seemed to give dreadful
>fuel consumption. 
  <snip>

Did you check for fuel leaks?  Fuel filter (underneath the gas tank, if it's
like my car), fuel hoses running to the engine compartment, fuel
distribution lines to the cylinders...  There's lots of places for a hose or
coupling to spring a leak!

I just went through an expensive trouble shooting experience on my car when
it ran rough and began to cut out.  Turns out the fuel pressure regulators
were not working properly.  Mechanic replaced them and engine ran great.
Symptom was a very noisy fuel pump as it tried to push fuel through a
regulator that was closing down.

Another cause for rough engine might be vacuum leak.  Those little vacuum
lines that run throughout the engine compartment get real brittle after 10
years and break when you look at them!  After I had my fuel pressure
regulators replaced I lost my brakes (well, they worked but were VERY hard).
Turns out the vac line to the pressure regulators broke, which kept the
entire system from getting a vacuum.

Regarding the hot engine...  is the fan turning?  Has the thermostat been
replaced?  Is the belt to the water pump on and adjusted properly?  If
everything works just like it should, you can put a cooler thermostat in for
about $25 (U.S.).  If you do, don't overtighten the bolts holding the
theromstat housing -- they only need about 1 ft-lb and then they'll strip!
Previous owner did that to my car...

Good luck and I hope you find your little gremlins fast!
