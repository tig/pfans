Every year Laguna Seca in Monterey hosts the Historics race weekend where
all the old cars come out for another day on the track.  There is a
different 'featured' marque, kinda' like a theme party.  This year was to
be Porsche's but they traded with Chrysler I believe, who celebrating the
Cobra.  Porsche will be the featured marque next year to coincide with
their 50th anniversary of racing glory (which track/victory forgive me for
not knowing - Pfans help!)

I went in '95 with the Miata club and had a great time.  We had approx. 225
cars lined up in our area.  Of course I trekked over to where all the
Porsche's were too!  It was right next to the Mazda area even.

We saw all kinds of cars from days gone by blasting around and really
racing each other!  My favorite was this white Lola - man that thing was
LOUD and really hauled (lucky the club had tent space at the back
straight!)

The weather is usually gorgeous that time of year, and Monterey proper is
very scenic for cruising.  

Check it out sometime!  I expect alot of 'us' will be there for sure next
year!
Phil
