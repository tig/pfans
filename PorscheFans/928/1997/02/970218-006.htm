I just bought an '88 928 S4. It's a wonderful car that turns heads
everywhere. However, the car has a couple of minor problems:

1. After driving on the freeway for a while, the AC blows hot air only. When
I get back to city traffic, the AC gets back to working normally after some
time.

2. The driver's side power door lock doesn't work right: It can be locked
from the passenger side or with the button in the center console, but does
not respond at all when I try to unlock it from the passenger door or with
the button. However, when I slowly unlock it from the driver's side, I can
hear the noise from it's little motor. I assume, there is no mechanical
problem with the motor, because when I try to unlock it from the inside using
the knob in the door panel, the motor takes over and finishes unlocking the
door.

3. Somebody had messed with the center console to install connectors for a
cell phone. There are some vibrations in the console, it's slightly out of
position, and I noticed some screws are missing under the dash. I'd like to
take the console apart and put it back together again (Maybe the above
problems were caused by messing with the console). I wonder where there are
"hidden"screws. 

4. The indicator light switch doesn't come back from the left position.
Somebody told me it would just need an adjustment.

Any suggestions on how to fix these things?

Thanks, your help is greatly appreciated!
