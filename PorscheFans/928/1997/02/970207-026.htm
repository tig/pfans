I have an 84' 928S w/ an automatic transmission (about 39K on the car) that
makes an unpleasant noise when put into drive.  It drives fine, and makes no
noise when put into reverse, just when put in drive once the car has warmed
up.  Sounds a bit like a boat transmission when put into gear.

I checked the transmission fluid (car running in N), and found it to be low.
 The owner's manual says not do add more fluid, but I added a little to see
if it where it would leak out, if was leaking.  Upon moving the car today, I
found a nice puddle of trans. fluid, leaking from the front of the car.
 While under the car the last time, I did notice there was a line running out
of the transmission to the front of the car.  I haven't had the chance to
look under the car yet, any ideas on what the problem may be?
