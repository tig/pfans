The auto tranny job is a PITA because it is under the car and 
there's at least 2 gallons of ATF in there.  You have to drain
the torque converter too don't forget.  To do that you have to
line up the crank to a certain position, which means you have
to turn the engine to a certain spot which means you take
the plugs out etc etc.

ATF is the nastiest crap IMO - worse than brake fluid.  It
gets into your skin and is downright ornery to deal with
never mind when you spill it it makes a heckuva mess.

Get a lift, a transmission filler and the correct filler
attachment and you might be OK, else pay the relatively 
cheap price and have a garage do it.  It's brainless work 
sure, anyone can do it, but in my opinion it's worth taking
it in.

Please don't ask how I know this ... you just struck a
nerve.  (I did it in the driveway - hours on my back
later and ATF soaked I was not a happy man! ;(
