Congratulations!

The hanging clutch pedal and cranky shifter point to the clutch not fully
disengaging, which in turn points to the hydraulic system which actuates
the clutch. The pedal works a master cylinder, which pressurizes hydraulic
fluid drawn from the reservoir shared with the brake system. This pushes a
slave cylinder, which works the clutch.

If this system has air in the lines, or if either cylinder is not working
properly, you won't be able to get the clutch to disengage no matter how
far you push the pedal. Look for leaks at both cylinders and along the
lines; a tiny leak, crack, or pinhole can, over time, draw in enough air to
make bubbles big enough to cause the above effect.

This effect is much like brake fade, which also has to do with bubbles
forming in hot hydraulic fluid, either because of air or because water
taken in by the fluid (happens over time, which is why you change your
brake fluid quite often, right?) boils, making bubbles of steam. Either
way, a column of fluid which is supposed to be incompressible becomes
squishy soft (although not on communism; these are good capitalist cars)
and won't push the stuff at the far end (brake pistons or clutch slave
cylinder) with the necessary force.

I mention this in part because you experienced this problem after driving
200 miles (and not sedately). Even if you weren't using the clutch very
much, it and the fluid dedicated to it got hot during this run. I had
symptoms of this sort one evening after a hard run; the pedal didn't just
hang, it snapped against the firewall and wouldn't come back up. I drove
home in first, stalling the engine at red lights, then using the starter to
get underway. The next morning, with the car cold, everything worked fine.

>great, just what I need.

All of the above has nothing to do with the condition of the clutch itself.
The clutch may be fine, or it may be fried or contaminated in such a way as
to prevent complete disengagement, but you appear to have a problem of the
sort which would lead first to the mechanism which works the clutch, as
above. Your mechanic should check these areas.

As far as burning out the clutch, you can't know for sure in what condition
the prior owner left it, and the automatic adjustment keeps adjusting until
it cain't no more. Running at moderate speeds (e.g., the 130 mph you
mention, which doesn't even get you into fifth) has no effect on the
clutch, which was presumably fully engaged (i.e., your foot was off the
pedal) at the time.

You can hurt a 928 clutch by the typical dumb drag race start (i.e., rev
the engine way up and dump the clutch); a few of those can do real damage,
but are not necessary to accelerate quickly. If you haven't broken your
brother's Esprit, you probably aren't used to doing anything invidious to
any part of your 928, which generally is a far more substantial car.

Please let the list know how this works out. With healthy hydraulics, you
should not have such problems, and should be able to enjoy your wonderful car.

Good luck!
