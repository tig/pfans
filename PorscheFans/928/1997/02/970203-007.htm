If you don't care for the looks or repair bill, then maybe you might just
remove the wiper and close the hole off.  I've seen a few 928's without
rear wipers and the car's lines were much smoother.  Probably helps
aerodynamics a bit too?

The list crashed around that time and a message was sent for everyone to
resubscribe at www.porschefans.com  .  The list that got restored was from
