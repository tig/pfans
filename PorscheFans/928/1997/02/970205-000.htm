Let me know what you find out on this - I so far have avoided polishing my
rims as I want to do it myself (recalling autoshop days standing in front
of buffer applying those big hunks of compound).  My car is an '84 928S
with the 'gold tone' finish on the flat S wheels.  I would suppose the
compound and buffing would strip that stuff away and get down to the metal
underneath but don't know for sure.

We should both jump over to this site I just found out about in Hemmings:
http://www.eastwoodco.com  (or net?)  
They are advertising a home DIY metal polishing kit.  I think it was two
different sets, depending if the item was already polished or not.  Came to
under $200 if I remember correctly.

I also found a professional polishing setup in the last Kit Car magazine
for $449, including stand.  That's about the cost of what it would be to do
my wheels at a shop, so I might investigate this further so I could have
another cool tool in "Dad's Workshop"  :) and start polishing everything in
site !  The oil filter, front brace, Mom's washer & dryer....  Hey wait a
minute, the 928 has an aluminum body right?  

:)
