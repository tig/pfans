   Matt,

   I'm not absolutely sure they are only mail order, but that is how i buy from them.  I guess many people 
might consider $7.75/qt(may not be latest price) expensive, though i have been using synthoil for quite a few 
years now, and they're actually a bit more than that.   I consider either of these brands relatively 
cheap insurance(when compared to engine meltdown), especially during my occasional outings to the track with 
either of my cars.  To a degree the price is offset by the longer drain intervals.  Red Line recommends drain 
intervals of between 12,000 and 18,000 miles.  I myself tend to go about 6,000 miles.  Red Line is out in CA 
and their # is 707-745-6100.
