Actually, the "big brakes" -- 4-piston Brembo calipers on the fronts --
started after the first 1,000 1986 928s.  I don't know the total production
&/or US import number for '86, but I seem to remember seeing that this was
about halfway through the run.

It's more than just the larger rotors and different calipers.  This is when
all 928's switched to anti-lock brakes.  I've heard, but can't confirm, that
these cars made the switch to the shocks/springs and other suspension bits
used on the S4s.

More rumor-mongering... the S4s front Brembo's feature unequal size pistons,
which is supposed to cure wear problems caused by the equal size pistons on
the "late '86" brakes.

Still, and as always with used Porsches, condition uber alles.  Happy
hunting, jaeger Tong!

P.S.
Went to watch the VARA vintage races at Phoenix Int'l yesterday.  Did the 30
minutes of "no speeding, no passing" (yeah, right...) public track time.
Not a bad little track, tighter & trickier than an IRS form with lots of
long decreasing radius turns.  The race-prepped Jaguar 4.2 XKE coupe did NOT
pull away, even after I started getting dizzy from the boiling brake fluid
fumes... (his and mine).  Yee, Haw!
