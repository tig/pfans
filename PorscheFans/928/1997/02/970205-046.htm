 Troy,
I was wondering what exactly did you have devek do and, was the 
horsepower per dollar ratio within reasonable limits ?  Inquiring minds 
want to know !  I'm already saving !

     Sorry for the long delay is getting back to you but as you will see 
     the list is long and it took some time to compile :-)  So here is the 
     list of mods to my little 89 GT:
     
     Wheels:  Porsche OEM Cup wheel 17 x 9.5 front and rear with Yokohama 
     AVS Intermediate tires 255/40 ZR-17 front; 275/35 ZR-17 rear.
     
     Brakes:  Upgraded to Porsche GTS brakes in front with 4 piston Brembo 
     calipers and GTS rotors.
     
     Shocks/springs:  Koni externally adjustable coilovers with Hypercoil 
     600lb front/400lb rear springs with adjustable spring perches.
     
     Sway bar:  DEVEK S4/race front sway bar, 6.0 mm wall thickness with 
     adjustable drop links.
     
     Clutch:  GTS pressure plate and clutch provides 23% greater holding 
     pressure for the increased output engine.
     
     The DynoTECH 6.0 liter engine. Here's a summary of what that includes:
     
     -  DEVEK stroker kit with Carrillo rods, Mahle pistons and DEVEK 
     stroker crank with modified pickup off mains
     -  baffled oil pan for improved oil pickup 
     -  Big valve heads, ported and polished
     -  high performance valve springs
     -  30 lb/hr fuel injectors
     -  rising rate fuel pressure regulator
     -  Modified headers and custom dual 3" exhaust system with dual 
     catalytic converters
     -  DEVEK radiator 
     -  engine blueprinted and balanced to very high tolerances
     
     Current figures:  335 hp and 387 lb-ft torque to the rear wheels.
     I hope this is going to go up just a little bit because we found a bad 
     vacuum diaphragm that let fuel enter the vacuum system. This has been 
     fixed but I have not had time to re-dyno the car since then.
     
     As for cost, look at your current catalog from Devek. You say you do 
     not have one, call them at 415) 610-0555. The only things listed above 
     that are not in the catalog are: 
        big valve heads. Those are kinda custom so call and get a current
            price quote.
        Engine building services from DynoTECH. these are quoted on a
            case-by-case basis. There are just too many variables for them
            to make a blanket price.
     
     These are the "upgrades" I did.
     
     Now the $#@!*&^ part!!! I had to buy a new block, bell housing and 
     ignition parts because the guy I bought the car off (A major 928 used 
     parts dealer near me in So. Ca.) never bothered to tell me that the 
     block was cracked and welded by him (a bad job by the way) that was 
     about to hit the main journal and cause a major failure. You know the 
     type where the piston goes out the hood or oil pan. The bell housing 
     broke as I was going to do my first run at The Streets of Willow, 
     killing the a day of fun and the money I had to spend to be there. The 
     ignition was off a 944, do I need to say any more here? Also I have 
     not replaced the 86 wiring harness he put into the car before selling 
     it to me. I know you are thinking that the old owner could have done 
     this and the parts guy did not know, WRONG I know the guy that owned 
     the car before and sold it to the parts guy! He is a personal friend 
     of a co-worker and it was not this way when he got rid of it. Yes I am 
     a bit mad at him.
