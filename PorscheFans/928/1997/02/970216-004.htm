Here's a sure sign you're a car fanatic; after swearing-off ever working underneath a car in a cold garage, 
you keep going back and doing it again.  I had promised myself i would wait until the weather warmed up before 
attempting to upgrade the clutch components responsible for causing that squeaking/rattling noise on my 89 GT. 
In spite of my aversion to working in the cold garage i finally just couldn't wait.  The noise was driving me 
crazy. 

   The problem parts were the release bearing, guide sleeve, and release lever, all identified in a factory 
technical bulletin.  According to the bulletin these parts were upgraded because "unfavorable tolerances" were 
identified as causing clutch chatter.  The new pieces were ordered from DEVEK, and on Marc's reccommendation i 
also upgraded to the beefier GTS pressure plate.  Apparently under hard use the original plate could start to 
show signs of heat stress.  I occasionally run on the track so i didn't give it a second thought.   As soon as 
i received the new parts it was easy to see the design improvement.  THe old release bearing/guide sleeve 
relied on a lubricated interface between the outer surface of the guide sleeve and the inner diameter of the 
release bearing for proper operation.  Without the lubricant in that space the two pieces could easily be 
induced to rattle against one another due to engine vibration.  All the lubricant in mine had dried up.  The 
upgraded parts now are assembled together with a sliding fit interface which requires no lubricant. THe 
interface between the release bearing and release lever was  also modified. 

     This was my first clutch job on any car, but after reading the procedure in the manual it seemed 
relatively straightforward.  The only real BEAR of a task was muscling up the new assembly back up into place. 
 Marc(DEVEK) had warned me to make sure i had the car up as high as possible to make it easier to work.  Man 
was he right!  Muscling-up a 25-30lb assembly, aligning it onto the locating holes on the flywheel, while on 
your back, with your arms bent, just plain WASN'T FUN! Of course after road testing the car today, and just 
hearing that V8 rumble with no hint of a peep from the clutch housing, it was all worth it. 

     One final note.  Both Marc and Susan at DEVEK made this job go a lot easier.  I called them several times 
before and during my upgrade project for their technical assistance, and each time they were extremely helpful 
and friendly.  Last but not least, for any newsgroup members in the New York Metro area, I would also recommend 
POWERTECH(Rockaway, NJ- 201-586-3210), owned by PCA club members Keith Peare and Mike Daino.  I took the new 
pressure plate to them for the insertion of the three shims used to take some of the spring force off the 
pressure plate to facilitate things when torquing it down to the flywheel.  They also assembled together the 
pressure plate, release bearing, and the release lever.   Their shop is near my work so i left the parts with 
them the better part of the day.  When i returned at the end of the day they did not charge me for the work.  I 
realize for them this job was relatively simple, Keith said it only took ten minutes, but i'm also sure many 
shops out there would not have done the same.  


     Now i'm ready for spring. :-)
