Nope!  It took a couple of tries though at first.  Like most of it came off
but some parts were still gold, kinda' like a peeling sunburn effect.  I
don't have a small enough 'goblet' shaped buff tool, so I just painted the
lug nut holes black instead of working those by hand too (oh my aching
shoulders!).

Is it a 6" or 8" bench mount?  I don't have a work table other than the top
of Mom's washing machine - which she has made a point of making me clean
more often!

?  Is this some sort of polishing rag or?  Eastwood has this stuff called
Nyaloc I think, it's supposed to seal polished surfaces so you don't have
to keep re-polishing.  Would a nice coat of wax do the same, for a while at


least?

Believe me, I am trying.  Where the heck are all these cars?

Oh yes.  Many things to celebrate.  Madison got a new job (and t-belt
retensioned).  I/we just had a 10th Wedding anniversary.  No Leap Year in
'97 so any Friday or Saturday will do for me (37 years old holy cow!). 
Hopefully I'll have finished polishing all the wheels and can show them
off.  SportsCarTrader ad hits next friday.  You're selling me your car!  

NOT!  Well I had to try right?
Phil
