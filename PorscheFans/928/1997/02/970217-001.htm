Matt,

When I had my auto 928S,  I was very impressed with the wet traction of the 
Yok 509's.    I bought several sets.  :-(      They would handle real close 
to full throttle in first until the upshift to second :-{}     I never 
looked to see if they made 17's in the 509's but they made me a believer in 
Yok. 

IMHO your current problem with hydroplaning is tires,  the car is 
definitely heavy enough to shed water from good tires unless the water is 
standing....

Good luck in your search,
