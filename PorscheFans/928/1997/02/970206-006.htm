Hi All,
        I've been lurking on this group long enough to finally go out and
test drive my friends 1984 928S.  Its got 93k miles on it.  There were a
couple of
interesting things I noticed:

1) If you are in low gear and you let up on the accelerator, you can hear the
drive line stutter (clutch chatter?)

2) Very hard to get a feel for the dual plate clutch.  Definitely easy to
get a surgey kind of stuttery feel to acceleration unless you rev hard. 
Reving hard seems to smooth things out (is this what they call clutch 
chatter?).  Spinning the clutch up a hill in 1st gave somewhat of a
light sputtery feel in the left foot.

Seems like possibly the clutch needs to be replaced or adjusted.  Either 
that or there is some kind of engine problem, but the engine seems OK.
My friend seemed to think the engine could use a tune-up, however.

3) I've heard that the late 84 928's had steel ball joints and the early
ones had aluminum ones.  I've also heard that you really want the steel ones.
Is there any way to tell by the VIN/Engine number?  Or am I going to have
to go under the front of the car with a magnet?

4) Previously in this mailing list, I've learned that you can move from the
dual plate clutch to the later single plate model for about $2k.  Anyone
done this?  What are the pros and cons?

5) The dual plate clutch is supposed to have good long term wear
characteristics.  However, my friend seem to go through one every
20-25k miles (2 years).  He doesn't drive it hard but he does live in a hilly 
San Francisco neighborhood.  Is this normal?

6) The transmission was very hard for me to get a feel of.  There seems to
be a spring that wants to push you over to the 4/5 gear side, so you push
against it a little for 2/3, and you push more for R/1. Thus 1 and 2 are
on a different plane.  This transmission is great for 4/5 highway driving
but sucks for 1/2 stop and go.  Do any 928 models have a more normal
1/2 shift pattern?  Is it proper for the spring to be pushing over to the
4/5 side?  Can anything be done to give this transmission a notchier feel?
Once I almost ground into reverse trying to downshift into second (synchro
or lack thereof stopped me).  Is it possible to put the later
Borg Warner transmission into this car?

7) I've done light maintenance on an MG and a Fiero before, and I figure the
only way I'm going to make a 928 affordable is if I look as it as a toy
where I do all the maintenance myself.  Eventually I'll probably like to
get to the point where I can change the clutch, timing belt, water pump etc.
myself.  Am I just asking for trouble here?

Otherwise I love the feel of the car.  The seats are much more comfortable
than my friends 87 911's seats.  The car is relatively quiet at highway
speeds.  Soft ride with solid handling.  Love the power assist steering.
In comparison the 911 was a rough, hard to turn, noisy monster.  The
transmission and clutch did feel much better, though.

Finally,

8) What do you think the car is worth?

Thanks in advance to a (maybe) future 928 owner!
