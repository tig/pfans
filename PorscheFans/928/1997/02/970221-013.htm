I have the same problem with my clutch, it will get worse and go to the
point were the clutch seems to have failed and not want to go into any
gears when cold.  What I have been told, is that the fluid system is
bleeding off, like when brakes bleed down and need to be pumped up.  You
can get under the car and see the Slave cylinder and a rubber hose that
could be causing the problem, both looked tired but had not failed yet on
my car. I have replaced the hose and ordered a new slave cylinder, (they
sent me the wrong one the first time) for the car.  I hope that this fixes
the problem, if so it will be a simple and inexpensive fix.  The master
cylinder is stuck up in the engine/firewall area so deep that it can't even
be seen or felt.  I hope that this is in good condition as I don't want to
have to replace it. 

Hose and slave cylinder came to $93 US
