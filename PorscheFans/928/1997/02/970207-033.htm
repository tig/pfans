The problem is the E in the VIN. Yours is probably a D, which means
it's an '83; the E means model year '84. The change was made in
September '83, according to the tech manual. If you had steel,
the 6 inch long piece itself would be steel. So it looks like you have
the earlier joints. 

The problem doesn't seem to have been bad enough to cause a recall,
but 2 or 3 people on this list have had failures, which sounds
excessive to me. Fortunately the failures were at low speed (the
obvious conjecture is that those who had failures at high speed
aren't around to tell us about it).
