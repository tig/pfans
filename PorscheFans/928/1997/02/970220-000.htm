stephane, (and all other aghast p-fans out there):

	no i don't use the tension tool. i judge the tension using
a technique i've seen in the chiltons and other mauals:

	make sure all of the slack is between the left cam sprocket and
the tensioner (as you look at the engine with the hood up). you should
be
able to twist the belt 90 degrees in the middle of that run of belt.

	if i had a 4v 928, i would be more hesitant to use this method, but
with my engine, its just not worth buying the tool. the only belt i've
had fail
on this engine did so at 37K miles, and the belt only failed because the
bushing in the tensioner roller pivot failed causing misalignment of the
tensioner roller, allowing the belt to partially slide off and grind it
self to
little shards. the really grim part was that my wife was driving it at
the time
and it stranded her on the freeway.
