I am amazed at the extent to which other people 'trick' innocent buyers
just to unload a used car!  I've come across alot of shysters myself and
been stung once regarding smog compliance.  It cost extra time and money to
repair & certify and yes I do hold a grudge against the previous owner (who
I see is still active in the POC) due to the way he lied through his teeth
which he's lucky to still have.  Now that's public I guess I won't have a
chance to act on my impulses but it is a reminder that you can't trust
anyone in the used car game.  Well who knows, I might just run into 'him'
or his 'slow' '72 911 at an event someday down in L.A. and ...

Anyways, I didn't get to see your car at the microbrew night but hope to
someday!  And glad to have met you Troy - as you know, we ended up in the
parking lot kicking tires and an hour passed before we knew it...!

After the ride back to SoCal your car should be getting fairly well
broken-in now - how's it doing?  Also, I am curious about your H-pipe setup
vs. Mark's Y-pipe.  Did you guys compare charts to see where the torque &
HP peaks differ?  

Just curious,
Phil Tong
