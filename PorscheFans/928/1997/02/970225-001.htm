Sorry I ignored the question last week and I discarded the file..  I had a
noise which was  more of a knock, vibration etc on cold start.  Independent
told me it was drive shaft and big bucks.   Dealer checked, under warranty,
the '86s had 5 year and this was 1990 and 32,000 miles.  Problem was loose
rivets and fixed under procedure 324018001 according to my repair order..
Parts were not costly.  Labor was 8 hrs tho to remove rear suspension and
tran.  Job was n/c,  

Problem recurred and Porsche had another fix, but not the drive shaft.  Again
new rivets or screws and drive plate and bearing.  44,500 miles.  No charge.
Bill lists 3240150002 procedure
 Parts were 
96011604200    Drive Plate
90005212200    ball bearings
special fasteners, etc. 
Labor was again 8 hours. 
 It is now 6 years later and no more problems and the drive shaft has not
been replaced.

Moral:  All noises are not the expensive drive shaft.  

In both cases, noise was not noticeable with windows closed driving on
highway.  Only with window open, at low speed as backing out of garage or
pulling in, etc.  May be this was unique.  I don't think so because Porsche
AG had a prepared fix.  It may have been in a tech bulletin???

Question about big brakes. I have ABS and the old brakes on my '86 which was
built in Oct. 1985.  Intro was Jan 1986 for 4 piston brakes at VIN GS 861000.

J Kent  '86 928S, auto
