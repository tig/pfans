Fine, but I've seen them come apart, and I've found very few hard-driving
Porsche people who find their steering or cornering response as crisp or
generally appropriate as that of the tires I mentioned.

>I don't think I have heard word one good from Michelin owners

Your theory's as good as mine.

>What do you usually pay for the 245/45's, and where do you get them?

Buy a copy of Road & Track and look up the tires of interest in Tire Rack's
ad. They almost always have the best price, though your friendly local tire
store may be willing to be induced to match it (mine has, most of the time).

>How rapid is even more rapid?

VERY roughly, how about less than 10k miles v. about 20k? I suspect the
price per mile is about the same for Conti and Michelin.

>I didn't select the Conti model designation that
>had been approved by Porsche, do you know anything about that?

Yes. Porsche has worked with the tire makers from which it buys (as have
GM, Toyota, and most other serious car companies) to develop
special-to-Porsche specifications for tires which may also be available in
the same model and size but not to that spec.

Porsche's tire specs, usually designated by "N0" or "N1", dictate slightly
different tread and sidewall construction, with handling and heat
resistance primary concerns. The fine print next to the tire sizes in the
Tire Rack ad carry such specs; for example, you'll note that several sizes
of the Michelin MXX3 are available both with and without that spec, with
the spec tires being (surprise) somewhat more expensive.

Whoo-EEE! Are you going to be shocked (positively) when you get some real
tires on your car! Even Dunlop (now what did he mean by that?) makes much
better tires than yours for ultra-performance cars.
