Hi 

  I had such a great time at Buttonwillow raceway last weekend that I wanted
to share it with the digest. I'ts not often that you get 7 928s on the track
specially not the assortment that we had. I took my mostly stock '78 (except
for the Devek suspenssion package). Susan and Mark from Devek were there 
with a 928 GTS and one of their stroked enginned S4s. There was also another 
Devek prepared S4, another S4 and even a supercharged 928. 
   The event was put on by the Ferrari owners club and I think we had more
928s than Ferraris. If you havn't taken your 928 to the track I highly
recomended it. One warning though, It's very addictive. Just ask my wife.
She drove her BMW 325i and when we got home the next day she was filling
applications for the next track event. Guess I'll have to do it again.  

  This was the 5th time I've taken my car to the track and I'm still amazed 
at how well it takes the abuse. The car is almost 20 years old with 158 kmi
and I'm able to drive 3.5 hrs each way to the track and put in two days of
all out red line driving and then it's ready to drive to work the next day.
I love this car. If I trade it will be for an S4. Even better would be an S4 
with the Devek engine enhancements, boy were those cars fast. 

Scotty we need more power!
