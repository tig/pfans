>If you know ahead of time that you'll need certain>parts, you might try

Don't forget Devek Performance (dev928@aol.com), they have had the best
prices on most of the parts that I have had to order.  It is also nice to
give them the business since they are one of the few aftermarket tunning
resources that we have for these cars. I have called four or five mail
order houses over the last couple of weeks looking for about 10 parts and
found the product knowledge and price was better at Devek.
