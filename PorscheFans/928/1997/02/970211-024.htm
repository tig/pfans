	I have comp TA ZR's and compared to Dunlop's OLD tire (D40) I think they 
suck! They are noisy, have poor (no) turn in ,and don't hold the road unless 
they are hot and low on air. The first time I drove on them I yhought my 
swaybar mount had come loose. They do however seem to be lasting awile. D40's 
only lasted 5 mos., but it was worth it!

	Try:   www.tirerack.com	You will find out more than you would ever want 
to(USAG ratings, how to feed your tires , prices, rims and much more!).

I think I will try Bridgestone's SO2's or Pirelli's  PZero's next time, they 
only have a wear rating of 140, but they are MAX performance tires(category 
above extreme performance). The SO2's came out on top, then the PZero's and 
the MXXXXVGTZ or whatever came out last, in the Tire Rack's own private test. 
I think I read in C&D or R&T that the SO2's wore very well on the long-term 
test 911, which all the writers/drivers abused.


	Well that's my buck-three-ninety-five worth.
