     Arizona residents might be interested to learn that SB1048, where in
simple English, the state fees for registering a privately owned car would
be reduced to a flat rate of $150.00 failed to pass.  My state senator,
Keith Bee, is the chairman of the Transportation committee, and said he
would be in favor of lowering the registration fees.  Lou-Ann Preble also
once emailed me, and was supposedly in favor of the measure.  The sponsor of
the bill, Edward Cirillo, was the only one to vote in favor of it in the
Transportation Committee.  It barely passed in the Finance Committee, 5 to
4, but it passed.  The following is a message I sent to Sen. Cirillo, with
copies to Bee and Preble.  Feel free to act as your conscience dictates.
Sorry for the bandwidth, but I think you'll understand.

Subject: SB1048 Date: Fri, 28 Feb 1997 16:44:27 -0700  From:Tom Reynolds
<kjtar@primenet.com> To: ecirillo@azleg.state.az.us
CC: kbee@azleg.state.az.us, lpreble@azleg.state.az.us

     I've emailed Keith Bee twice, no response.  He told me before the
election he was in favor of lowering the vehicle registration fees.  Can
you answer me and explain what happened?  You were the only one to vote
in favor of the bill, if I'm reading the information correctly
(Transportation Committee vote detail).  I'm sending this to Mr. Bee and
also Lou-Ann Preble, who did email me once.  I belong to a lot of
automotive mailing lists on the Internet, and I will reluctantly spread
the word that Arizona is no place to aspire to own a nice new car.  I
would think the new car dealerships would be distressed as well, but I
thank you, at least, for your affirmative vote on the bill.  I'll be
interested to see if this email brings any response from any of those
mentioned above.  And people wonder why citizens are fed up with
politicians.

Sincerely, and with kind regards,
Tom (and Karen) Reynolds
