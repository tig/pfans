Hello All

Has anyone done a rear wheel bearing replacement? I just finished
replacing the left rear CV joint on my car because it had a torn
boot and I thought that it had gone bad. I wasn't sure how long the
boot had been torn and there was a sort of humming coming from 
that area when I drove. Now I've found that after the replacement 
the noise is still there. The only thing left is the bearing. 
European Car mag has a really good article about replacing the
rear wheel bearings on a 911 and I was wondering if the 928 was
the same. The Chilton's manual is useless for this operation and
the I'm missing two of the factory manuals that came with the car,
one of them being the chassis section. 

Any information on this subject would be great.
