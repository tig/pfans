928 - Great choice!  

Older than '84?  I think most will steer you to newer than '85 if it will
fit your budget.  Why?  '85 saw the beginning of great things for this car:
1.  32v 5.0 liter V8  (big hp finally!  288 vs. 234 and under)
2.  Improved 5 speed gearbox synchros (if you can find a manual car for
sale that is)
3.  If car is 4 speed AT, I've heard from others that 1st gear will hold to
redline.  My '84 holds 1st 'only' to 5k rpms.  Devek is investigating a
'shift-kit' for me.  All other gears should hold to redline.  (no comment
on top)  The 3 speed autos also should hold 1st to redline. 

The '84 itself does offer a good upgrade - steel ball joints vs. the older
aluminum joints.  The latter has been reported to fail.  See the archives
on this.  If you plan on AX'g then I'd say this is a big point to consider.

Other things I've heard/read is that the earliest of cars, '78 and '79, had
some electrical bugaboos which got sorted out by model year '80.

Style wise is your call.  The pre-S models do look kinda' cool without the
front/rear spoilers and body rub strip.  I saw a blue Euro model at the
dyno one day that had C2 turbo rims and the Euro flush fog lamp. It was a
bright electric type of blue and with the rims, it look like a HotWheels
collector car, know what I mean?  

Maybe the biggest reason for an early car is the non-interference 16v
motor?  If you are unfortunate enough to have the T-belt fail or jump, at
least it won't grenade the valves/pistons.  Anyways, this is turning into a
long rant/rave so I'll end on one last note:  I shopped like heck before I
bought my '84 privately and all the cars I saw on car lots were in horrible
condition, undocumented and in dire need of so much repair in and out that
I wonder where they ended up.  Poor cars.  But don't get emotionally
wrapped up, because as in real life it could cost you a bundle to fix.

Check out classified 2000 for listings across the country, good luck!
Phil
