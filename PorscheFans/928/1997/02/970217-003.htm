Howdy All!!!

Well, it had to happen!  I have an oil leak and I need to get it fixed.  Most of
my rubber hoses, Cam plugs etc. etc. are cracking or shrunk.  I took the
car to a mechanic, who owns a 928, which gives me a little confidence
that he respects the car and has experience.  He estimated 8.5 hrs of
labor to replace all rubber hoses (that have to do with the oil rebreathing
system) and cam plugs.  I can imagine that it would take this long to do
the work, since the intake and valve covers have to come off.  He also
estimated about $150 in parts.  If any of you have had this type of work
done before, does this sound resonable?

Thanks,

Matt Butler
