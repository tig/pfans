After gathering information from retail suppliers and from list members (both
on 928 and the rest of the pfans lists), I have put together all of the
information below in a post so that all members may have access to it.  I
recieved a lot of inquiries and I promised all to post to the list.  If
anyone has any questions that are unanswered please send me a line.  Keep in
mind that this information is merely compiled from several sources, and is
not first hand.  I intend to start the work on the wheels in the next month
or so.

The info is listed in basic steps from start to finish:

1)	Remove any coating
	
	A)	Clear coating and other paint can be removed with aircraft paint stripper
		i)	available at auto parts stores; in large can and I found a spray can
				that should be enough to do all four wheels (about $4.00)
		ii)	don't leave it on too long, it might cause mild pitting or etching
		iii)	use a scraper or dish scrubber (nylon ball) to remove the paint as it
				bubbles up.  Always use gloves, and eye protection.  Have plenty of
				running water nearby to flush the area after you remove the paint, and
			for any splatters on your skin.  Use a bucket to rinse the scrubber or
				scraper off.

	B)	Anodizing can be removed with Easy-Off oven cleaner
		i)	It may burn the metal and produce a black haze, this can be removed
				with sandpaper or other abrasives
		ii)	Always use gloves, and eye protection.  Have plenty of 							running
water nearby to flush the area after you remove the paint, and 			for any
splatters on your skin.  Use a bucket to rinse the scrubber or 				scraper
off.

2)	Make sure your surface is smooth and ready to be polished
	A)	you can use a variety of abrasive techniques to smooth the wheel
		i)	wet/dry sandpaper in graduating grits until you are satisfied with the
			smoothness (downside is wearing out your arms and hands)
		ii)	greaseless abrasives (available from BrightWorks as listed below) on
			a buffing wheel.  Graduating grits until you remove the imperfections.
		iii)	emory compounds on a buffing wheel or by hand
	B)	Clean the wheel with Prep Sol or similar cleaner to remove all of the
			compounds and chemicals.

3)	Polish	
	A)	Use a Tripoli polishing compound to start the polishing process
		i)	apply on a seperate buffing pad
	B)	Use a coloring compound for the final polish
		ii)	apply on a seperate buffing pad
	C)	You may need to use an additional coloring compound depending on the type
		of metal or the results that you get from the first coloring compound.
		iii)	apply on a seperate buffing pad

4)	Materials
	A)	Auto parts store for the aircraft stripper and Prep Sol or other cleaner
	B)	Grocery store for the Easy Off and the scrubbers/gloves
	C)	BrightWorks for the polishing and abrasive suppllies
		i)	I talked with Dave (the owner) for over 1/2 hour and was able to learn
			all that I needed to know in order to get the wheels polished.  His
				prices were phenomenal, and he had all of the gear I would need in
				order to accomplish the polishing.  I expect to spend less than $40.00
			and have everything that I need to do far more than 4 wheels.  His
				small kit includes the mandrel for your drill, two buffs, and the two
			compounds for only $14.95.  I will add the greasless abrasives and at
			least one additional buff.  I have the catalog now and there are plenty
			of other tempting things to buy.
		ii)	Bright Works, Inc.
			106 Loretta Lane, Dept 932
			St. Paul, MN  55115
			(612) 429-4439
			WEB order form with links to the rest of his
page:								http://www1.minn.net/%7Ebright-1/ord.html
	D)	You can use your power drill, die grinder, or similar power tool.  Just
			specify the appropriate size of holes in the buffs for your shank, and get
		the appropriate mandrel.
	E)	If you have to do ultra-detailed areas then you may use a Dremel tool,
			Bright Works has the buffs for the Dremel or your hardwar store should
			have them too
	F)	If you have to do semi-detailed areas you might get a 1/4 flexible shaft
			extension for your drill and some cone buffs (One source mentioned to me
		was Sears, I think Bright Works has some in the catalog)

I still do not know what factory coating the 928 flat wheels came with.  I am
going to use both steps for removing coatings (anodizing and paint) to be
safe.  Unless I hear in the meantime from someone that knows...
I beleive that the gold wheels are an anodizing, and the silver/gray wheels
are only clearcoated, but I don't know and haven't been able to find out so
far.  

Good luck and let me know if you have some success,

Ciao,
