I purchased the microfilm workshop manual through my local Porsche
dealer for ~$37.  They are also listed at http://www.myporsche.com.
The Microfiche do have all the info but the picture quality is only
so so.  I cant wait for the thing to be available on CD rom.

When I jack my 928, I place the garage jack at the rear jacking
position of the car. I put a hockey puck between the jack and the car
(I do not remember who suggested this one but it does work wonders :-).
The car is so stiff that the front weel will also come of the ground.

I then place a jack stand under the front jacking position and lower the
car down.  the car then sits high enough off the ground that you
can put a carjack at the rear of the car (I put a piece of wood between
the body of the car and the stand to prevent any damage).

I then move to the other side and do the same thing.  Once I have 
jack stand at the 4 corners, I put the car jack under the rear 
suspention (as described in the owners manual) and make the final 
lifting adjustment to make the car even.
