Some of us would say that your wife is getting the better deal.

ca. 15/10 mpg

There should be no surprise if you're used to a 911. A knowledgeable
mechanic will be able to diagnose a problem without having to replace every
part. Access for some procedures is difficult, increasing time. Some parts
are unusually expensive, but not by Porsche standards.

>Can this car replace a daily driver even during winter (Luxembourg, Europe)?

Yes, although it will not provide as good traction in snow as your 911. You
must use true winter tires for best results in snow and generally at very
low temperatures (at which the rubber of typical Z-rated tires becomes hard
and unsticky). I bought a set of Michelin X M+S 330 H-rated snow tires last
fall to solve this problem, but have not put them on this year because our
winter has, so far, been almost snow-free.

>Is it a dependable car?

Yes, remarkably so. Perform scheduled preventive maintenance and it should
simply work and continue to work for a very long time.

"Or" is not the best word. This is just as nice a touring car as the big
BMW, but is also a real sports car, fast to the very highest standards in
every respect (top speed, acceleration, cornering, braking, steering
response, "squirt" through sudden openings in traffic, etc.). I find it
delightful to have all this performance available while cruising comfortably.

>I thank all of you in advance for your comments and answers.

Please let us know what you decide and how it works out.
