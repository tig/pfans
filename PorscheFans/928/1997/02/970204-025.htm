The rear wiper isn't hardly rocket science. There's a wiper motor, which
moves a plate with a hole in it back abd forth, and there's a wiper arm,
with a short arm connected to it, which has a pin which engages the
aforementioned hole. Where in this chain is yours failing? The problem
I had was that the plate wasn't engaging the pin, because it was stuck
in the down position (it slides up and down). The same problem, from
evidence provided by this list, has been seen all over the world; on
two corners of it, anyway. 

Regarding the tailgate lock: mine runs off fuse 23, which also supplies
the clock and the interior lights. There is also a cleverly concealed
fuse, in-line near the release motor, which is in the line that runs
the motor back to the locked position. If your motor just stops when
you release the button, find that fuse, it's blown. If your problem
is that the motor runs but doesn't reliably release the tailgate,
let me know when you find a solution, please.
