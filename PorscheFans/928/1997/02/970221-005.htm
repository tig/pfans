Hi All!

At last my 1980 928S arrived from England. I got a 1 day permit to drive it
from the wharf to home and it is now in my garage. Over the next week or so,
I need to get an engineer's report and roadworthy certificate in order to
get it registered. One item that I will have to attend to is the fitting of
side impact bars in the doors as Australia was one of the first Countries to
stipulate these.

The reason for this post is to ask if anyone can shed light on a strange
situation that occurs with the clutch. I put the car into gear (say 1st or
reverse) then let the clutch out with the handbrake off and let the car
gently take up engine compression pressure via the transmission. If I then
put my foot on the clutch, I would expect the car to roll a little (very
slight slope) and the gear lever should move easily into neutral. This does
not occur, the car stays still and the gear lever is quite firm to move into
neutral. When it does move, then the car will then roll a little. It is like
the clutch is not disengaging properly when I put my foot on the pedal.
However, the clutch seems to work OK in normal use. Should I pursue a
"problem"? or is this a feature of a twin plate clutch? I can't see why.

Any advise is gratefully received.

I tried this again, and realized that I was only partly correct.  WinZIP
will work only if the file is MIME-encoded.  Unfortunately, the PorscheFans
digests are NOT.  When I did this, I was looking at a digest (same NTMail
list server software) that has a file attached.  THEIR mail client hadn't
encoded the mime so that MY mail client would recognize it, but WinZIP did.

I received a suggestion a few weeks ago from James J Dempsey (a P-Fan) that
the digests be formatted in RFC 1153 format. I've sent this suggestion on to
the folks at Internet Shopper (that's who makes NTMail).  He uses the MH
mail reader, but I don't anything about this.

In short, we're still looking for a mail client that separates messages. 
Probably won't happen unless Internet Shopper changes the format of the
digests.

Sorry about the mis-information with WinZIP.  I should've double-checked. 
So much for being infallable (ha!).
