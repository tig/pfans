Greetings,

I just stumbled across the Porsche Fans archives and I've been catching up.

I have an 84 928S which I purchased in Sept of 96. Right away, I and had the
timing belt replaced along with all of the oil seals on the front of the
block. The timing belt replacement was just a precaution. The car has 110K
on it and I wanted to be safe. The oil seals were weeping and needed to be
replaced. Now, even with fresh Mobil 1, there are no leaks.

The 4 speed auto leaks ever so slowly. 1 or 2 drops a day. I'm not "going in"
there yet. It shifts great! No wierd noises. The car goes to redline on every
shift. Perfectly. It breaks loose and kicks out to the side when it hits second
and lurches forward. Feels great! Of course, just like all other 928 owners,
I wish I had more power (not that I need it ;=). BTW, of course I ment that it
goes to redline on every shift if I floor it.

The former owner had the car completely repainted in Feb of 96. He spent a
cool $3500 and it looks beautiful! Guards red w/ black interior. The interior
is in excellent shape. One small straight line crack in the dash just 
in front of the steering wheel. Looks kinda like a mold seam. 

AC is weak. Climate Control doesn't work. Heater is binary...nice and hot or
off. 

The sun-roof motor is missing. Any ideas where to find one and the cost?

That's it, though. Everything else seems to work fine and is in great condition
including brakes, shocks, tires, belts, hoses, etc. All in all, a well 
maintained car that is being babied by me now.

I'm happy. Now, does Devek have a catalogue?
