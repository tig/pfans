Collected the car on Monday afternoon.  The dealer phoned on Friday
afternoon and enquired whether they might have it one more day (Monday)
to make sure everything was in order.  Total time off the road was 1 week,
but this was not a problem as I was keen to see everything was fixed and
tested properly.

The rear wiper motor was listed as requiring replacement but a gentleman
known as Mr John C C White (also a genius) diagnosed the fault from a 
distance of about 16,000 miles.  Thanks John, followed your instructions
exactly; applied some lubrication and it is working better than new !

Replacement cost for wiper motor would have been $413.  I cannot but refer
back to my original email a few nights ago where I discussed the repair
methods often used today.  Its almost as if technicians/mechanics look for
the hard solutions first instead of seeking the obvious.  I am certainly
not labelling members of the repair/service industry in a global sense but
there is a percentage of operators who merely wish to throw the old part
away and charge the customer for a new one, without first investigating a
little.


Took the car for a long run that night; cc still needs some adjustment.  Guys
said that vacuum pressure was good, no leaks, but a valve that regulated the
process was sticking and may need to be replaced.  Passenger side mirror seems
to work intermittently, but will leave for the time being - it may settle down.

Major problem however, once car reached a certain temperature, above operating,
after say, sitting in traffic for awhile, the engine began to run extremely
rough.  Like physical shaking.  Terrible to drive, and seemed to give dreadful
fuel consumption.  Remember,the car has just been serviced.  Does anyone, please,
have any ideas ?  I feel it must be something simple.  My line of thought 
considers the combustion process for injection -  fuel, air, ignition... sensors
(the link with the temperature);  or  the rough running was similar in nature
to that which I once encountered in a BMW many years ago... turned out to be a
bad spark plug lead.

A set of plug leads for the 928 in Oz is about $1,000.


Best wishes to all.
