Hmmm.  Detonation occurs when the air/fuel mixture is prematurely ignited
right?  Either due to incorrectly advanced timing or a glowing hot spot
like carbon build-up residue, etc.  This in itself shouldn't cause the
ceramic insulator to break, as it should be designed to withstand the heat
and pressure of normal combustion processes whether or not the engine is
detonating.  

I could understand if the plug wasn't designed for say a highly pressurized
turbo motor and it broke apart, but I don't think this was the case...  Or
if it was the wrong heat range for the intened usage and the plug didn't
get adequately cooled by the incoming charge and failed that way.  If the
plug was dropped maybe it developed a hairline crack which lead to it's
destruction?

A bad plug?  (how many broke anyways?)  How do they quality control a plug?
 Pull every 1,000th and run it?  Heat it in an oven until it melts?  In any
event, that was a while ago and I hope the newer plugs have the bugs worked
out!
