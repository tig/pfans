Hi guys

I have a couple of problems with my car, which someone can hopefuly
enlighten me upon.

My first problem is the air con, or more accurately the centre vent. 
When I accelerate (even gently) the centre vent closes, and dosen't
open again.  If I turn the selector to the 'eco' position the vent
will open again.  I can then move it back to aircon and it will work
until I accelerate again.  The air con unit works fine (heaps of cold
air).  I gather it must be vacuum driven somewhere along the line -
has anyone done this before and can give me a few pointers?

Second (and a related problem) is the temperature setting.  If it is
on minimum (18c down here) then it gives out cool air, if it is on any
other setting (ie > 18.5c)  it gives out full heated air. I assume it
is some kind of temperature  sensor but I have no ideas where it may
be - any tips, hints, solutions?

Finally I have noticed the front right inlet manifold is a little
dirty - looks like oil.  The car's oil level dosen't change much and
it seems to be since the hot weather.  I haven't seen it before, and I
am thinking that it may be the oil breather - anyone had this problem?

One last thing.  Is there any book or manual that gives an overview of
how the various systems work on the 928?  If I knew exactly how the
various systems function then I would be able to diagnose problems
myself.


Thanks guys
