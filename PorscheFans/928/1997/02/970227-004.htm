All wheels polished and spit shined now!  My mom's neighbors are probably
glad not to hear my drill anymore!  I am glad not to be wrestling with the
wheels on the garage floor anymore.

Results?  Close to a mirror-like shine!  A major PITA but what isn't
DIY-wise.  Lots of little black bits of compound all around the shop floor.
 My hands are tired and swollen from hanging onto the drill for so long but
the car looks great.  A supply of fresh, clean buffs would've made this job
easier - I only had one new and one old buff.

I want to try to polish the strut brace next!  If I had the time, the
airbox & ram tubes would be on the list too... 'that would be cool, heh heh
eheh' (knarly Beavis voice)

So, the 928 is back on the road and prettied-up for some 1/4 miles at
Sear's Point saturday. Any ET guesses?  Hint: I won't be needing a helmet!

Phil
