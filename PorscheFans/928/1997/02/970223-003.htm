Hi all,

Now I guess I won't get to own the 928 GTS after all (at least not for now).
My wife took a 1989 930 with factory mods (335 hp). Now we have to 911's and
still no 928. So up and saving because next time I'll be the one to decide!

If anyone is interested the car is still for sale and even if the asking
price is pretty high, I had the guy down to about $40,000. In my opinion it
is a great deal considering that the car has a brand new engine with 0 miles
on it installed at the factory and carrying a 12 month warranty. I don't
know if the car will meet US specs though.

Also, and this has to happen very quickly. I am planning on getting a new
RUF 911, so mine is for sale. The car is a Porsche 930 RUF BTR with 385 hp
and the light weight interior. It has the complete RUF package including
body mods, wheels, interior, engine, transmission, roll cage etc.. You name
it and it's got it. This is also the car to have to kick some ... at the
club meetings. Overall the car has 50,000 miles, but the engine and the
transmission have been redone about 6,000 miles ago. The RUF bill was a cool
40,000 US $. This is a serious car. I am willing to sell it for $65,000
firm. The car will have to be picked up in Europe. That's all for me.
