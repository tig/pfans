>>This is my first post to this list (usually on the 911 list). I am thinking
about getting my wife a 1993 928 GTS (5 spd) with 28,000 miles.<<

Leonard Laub (leonard@visionthree.com) responded.

My two cents worth:

1.  Leonard Laub is correct in everything he says.  As for snow - Porsche
recommends little narrow bicycle-like tires.  This is a high torque machine
(especially in manual) and with wide tires just spins and spins and spins in
the snow and ice under power.  Check your local Porsche garage and get the
snow tires (with separate wheels).

2.  I my humble opinion, the GTS is one of the best cars ever made.  It is an
amazing `Bahn cruiser and very nimble.  The 5-speed is an accelleration
demon.  Keep the rev counter above 3000 and it will blaze.  Also, for reasons
unknown to me, the 928 is a very reliable car, with the GTS the most reliable
of the bunch.  My economy experience (very spirited) in US is +/- 18 miles
per (US) gallon, mixed driving (Los Angeles City driving - open road).  I
have enjoyed 21 miles per (US) gallon on open road at +/- 80 mph average.

3.  The 5-speed does take a little getting used to, because the shift pattern
is not the normal "H" pattern, but rather the racing "Dog Leg."  This, of
course, is just a habit thing and I'm sure the lucky little woman will
accomodate to it quickly.  Both my wife and I have gotten used to the Dog Leg
on our UK car (which, of course has the added advantage of RHD to confuse
us).
