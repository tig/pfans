It does take a little time to get used to this.

I would agree with both of those

VIN# 92 ES 860404  and on of the 1983 928's have the steel ball
joints...So this should not affect yours.

Being a Grand Touring Coupe designed for the Autobahn,   I would say the
hills of San Francisco are especially hard on your friends 928.   Mine
has 70K miles and has never needed a new clutch.  All highway miles.

R 2 4

My dad did this too because he was used to driving a Chevy.  Here is
what you need to do.   This car has a reverse lockout.  So it is
impossible to go from first gear to reverse unless you take the shifter
to between 4/5th gear.  If you try to miss reverse you often put it
directly into 4.   What I recommend is TRY to put it into reverse after
you have had it in first....push straight foreward toward reverse and
you will feel the shifter glide right past reverse and into second.  THe
other gears fall in naturally.    Spring pressure makes the shifter rest
between 2/3  The spring pressure between and R/1 is much harder than
between 4/5.  I think this further keeps you from going into Reverse
unintentionally.

It's possible you friend has a broken or missing spring

Don't bite off more than you can chew.....By the way....There isn't a
Haynes manual for 928's yet...if that is a hint.
