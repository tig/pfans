   Glad to hear you had a good time.  Reminds me of my first track outing with the club( April, '96) at 
Limerock, CT.  Initially, i was hesitant of oversteering with such a powerful rear-wheel drive car, but to my 
amazement the car was unbelievably stable(thanks to the Weissach rear axle design),  both when coming off the 
throttle, and when getting back on the power.  How do you like the DEVEK suspension setup?  How does it feel in 
day to day driving?  Even though my car only has 20,500 miles the damping/rebound rates on the shocks seem to 
be "slow to react".  I can't believe it was this was from the beginning, especially in the GT's. It may  be the 
length of time they have been in the car has contributed to a slow degradation.  Actually, i briefly spoke to 
Mark about their suspension package several months ago, and he mentioned that the setup could be tailored to 
whatever i wanted.  Ride and handling are so subjective, I'm not sure how i would go about doing this without 
actually being able to drive a car with a typical setup.  In any case the DEVEK package looks awfully tempting, 
so if anybody else has it on their car, i would like to hear all your driving impressions.
