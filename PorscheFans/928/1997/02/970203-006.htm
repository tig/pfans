Hi Robert & PFans list!

I printed out your email so we could do a toast to ya' but I guess I did
get a little toasted too soon!  Early in the evening the weather was more
London like with fog and a light mist but by the time everyone got there it
cleared up slightly.  Much brews, fries and chicken strips were devoured
(thanks again Shawn).  Around 9pm, we splintered into two groups - one
group went inside to rock with the music and the other headed straight for
the parking lot to check out the cars!

After much circling (and a couple of impromptu pit stops) the die hard
Pfans held their own mini-sound-off contest in the parking lot!  The
'search and rescue' group that was sent to retrieve us, found us huddled
inside Jim's black & tan S4 getting our brains rattled by his
multi-woofered and amp'd sound system!  Dang that's a nice car especially
with those Antera rims.  We moved some cars over by his since if you
coughed too loudly the alarm would sound!

We spent some more time back at Gordon Biersch and did our best to help out
with this bachelorette party scavenger hunt when the party moved
(literally!) across the Bay Bridge to another pub in Walnut Creek!  Traffic
was light and 'engine clearing' spots were chosen carefully.  And that's
all I'm going to say about that!

All had a good time and look forward to meeting again.  There's talk of
BBQ's and road trips and who knows where we'll end up!  Maybe to
Buttonwillow to tag along with Devek, or the Napa/Sonoma wine country, or
???

Cheers!
Phil '84 928S
ps.
To all the 911 lurkers and drivers-by that honked at us - did you see that
custom C2 Cab in the lot and come over next time!  Matter of fact, I've
been getting the urge for a 911 again but that's another story!
