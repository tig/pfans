You replaced the CV joint? I'd then guess you have the tools and/or muscle 
to remove that big nasty nut on the half shaft. And that's about the 
hardest thing to do.

Basically, you see that big hunk of cast aluminum behind the disk brake 
sheild? You disconnect everything until you get that off. Then you take it 
to a machine shop that has a press and an oven. Let them heat it and press 
in a new (cold) bearing. Don't forget to remove the circlip before trying 
to remove the bearing. Cost about $15 when I had mine done. Cost between 
$75 and $100 for the bearing.

You could bake the assembly in your kitchen. I understand the bearing comes 
out fairly easily after being baked at 250 for a while. Paying someone else 
to do it was much much less trouble.

Assembly is the reverse of disassembly.  :-)

I figured while I had the half-shafts off and the transmission in for 
rebuild, that I was going to replace the wheel bearings simply because I 
was in there.
