Yes, I have information on the third generation of that car. Two friends of
mine in Minnesota bought the rights to the original Kwok Spyder and have
developed it over 2-1/2 years into a fully-finishted, rigid and comfortable
production car.

It now has side windows, a beautifully-articulated folding top, and great
interior. The lines are slightly improved in the front, as well.

They got ahold of me because I have a 928 Carelli convertible, and they
were researching chassis reinforcement.

They are going into production soon, and the car will be pricey. E-mail me
if you want more information. right now the company name and office
location are in negotiation...

P.S. Because of an impending move, I am considering selling my 928
convertible. You can see it pictured on page 110 in the newest Automotion
catalog (#16), or on the web at Shane Garner's Concept 928 site:
http://www.auburn.edu/~garnecs/928.html

I have a fair amount of money in it, but the price would be about half of
the Spyder's...
