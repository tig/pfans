Hi All!

Mathew Stewart <stewartm@cyberhighway.net> asks about keeping the rubber
rear wing and interior components in good condition. He says that the PO said
that if he stopped putting Armoral on the dash as the previous PO had done
religiously the dash would crack in a couple of months.

Yes, I have heard that Armoral actually damages the vinyl in cars by some
chemical process. I guess that is a good reason not to use it. I purchased a
Zymol car care kit that contained a vinyl treatment and it works like a
charm! I can't advise of its long term performance but, being a Zymol
product, it can't be bad. In conclusion, many people say to keep all silicon
products away from your car. They might be easy to apply but they don't
protect in the long term.

My 0.02c worth.
