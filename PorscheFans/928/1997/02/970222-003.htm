I was fortunate to be able to make it to this event with my newly modified 
Devek 928. Boy was it fun. At the end of the second day I was turning 2:14 
lap times in my 100% street legal and every day car. Just so you can 
compare Mark (from 928 international) and Tilo (the super charged 928) 
where both turning 2:04. Not bad for a street can with street tires!! Devek 
can build one hell of a car!

Okay, I will now get off my soap box and talk about the other cars. It will 
be hard as I am still on the high from this weekend! There where a total of 
7 928's at the event. I think this was more then the Ferrari's, but I did 
not count them as I passed them :-) and they put this on. What a nice bunch 
of guys though. This is a great group and I am thinking of joining the 
club. I have never seem so many 928's in one place at one time. It was 
great watching them all go around the track. The only problem any 928 had 
was a stock radiator gave out. Mark from Devek drove all the way back to 
his shop at the end of the first day and picked one up. He then installed 
it before the first race on Sunday. Talk about customer service!

It would be great to have the 928 people get together and sponsor something 
like this some day.

89 928 (Devek modified)
92 500SL (good for sunny days :-)  )



From Phil Tong <<
Nope.  The owner must be a real enthusiast/engineer like Marc at Devek, so 
he put the time and effort to build the motor with quality components.  
     
Eddie - you were there, what was that beast like?  How about a turn by turn 
syopsis from the driver's (your) point of view!
     
Phil
ps.  I hope to make it at the next track event!
