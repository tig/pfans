Any 928 S4 from '87 forward, or any 928 GT from '89 forward.

>What options are the most desirable?

These cars are essentially "fully loaded". If you're into sporting
interaction with the car, you'll be happier with the five-speed, rather
than automatic, transmission. Either way, you'll want the limited-slip
differential (code 220 on the sticker under the mat in the trunk). The
sport shocks (code 030) are quite stiff, to the point of interfering with
touring comfort.

>Is the GT better than the S4?

Not a lot. Slightly hotter cams produce 10 bhp more (3% rise) and a
slightly edgier temperament. Condition and documentation are vastly more
important than these differences.

>Is there a book to help me out here?

A recent issue of Excellence magazine carried Bruce Anderson's review of
the 928 market.

>What 928 would YOU look for at $30,000 or less?

Mine.
