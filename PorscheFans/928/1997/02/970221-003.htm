For those who responded to my question about my stuck rear deck lid on my
82 928, the problem was that the lock was broken (cheapest fix was $150 for
parts, non-matching key, non-alarm key; matching alarm key was $600+
parts!); the electric inside deck lid release didn't become standard until
either 83 or 84, and I could find no way to get the lid open except with my
checkbook (as in, paying my mechanic to do it).

Now for my new problems; my 3-speed automatic is slipping when I first
start out in the morning; once the car is warmed up, it's fine--but I have
to start out in something other than drive, keep it in second for several
minutes, then shift to drive.  I've had it serviced (fluid changed); any
ideas short of a rebuild?

Second problem--a real attention-grabber--I was driving along the other
night when suddenly I had no headlights; all other lights work fine,
headlights go up and down as normal, but no high or low beams at all; fuzes
are ok; I'm currently clueless as to what the problem might be.  Any ideas?

TIA.
