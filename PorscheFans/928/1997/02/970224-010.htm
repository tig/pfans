Maybe the toggle switch needs attention?  I noticed on my car sometimes if
the switch is in a certain position the mirrors seem to be dead.  A little
jiggle and presto back in operation.  Probably a good idea to check the
connections...

Re: the seats
I started to investigate this also.  World Upholstery might be able to
help, depending on which seat you have.  There's also a tech session on
interiors Mar. 1st if you are in the bay area...
