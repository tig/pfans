That's most likely fixable by adjusting the height of the release
knob.

I had a similar thing happen over time. There are two things you can
do to adjust it.  One is the little rubber stops on the hatch screw
in and out, making them rise and fall accordingly.  Try that - maybe
the hatch is too far away from the motor.  Screw the little knobs IN
I think because the hatch may be too far away from the motor.  Screw
each side the same amount.  Also, don't get the hatch too close down
to the body so it touches.

The other thing if that doesn't work to shim under the motor itself
with a washer or something.  There are two allen screws that can be
removed and washers placed underneath.  That's what fixed it for me.

It's all "low tech" stuff - just have to improvise and make the thing
fit.  I think what happens is where the hatch release resides gets 
slightly deformed over time so you have to prop the motor up a little.
