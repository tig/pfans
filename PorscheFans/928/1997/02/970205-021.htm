The fluid will expand as I understand.

The biggest pain is getting under there to check it.  And if you
jack the car you have to make sure it's level because presumably
the level changes if the car is higher in the front or back.

On my car, there is a range it's supposed to be in and as long as
it's there warm and cold, I think it's OK.  Normally I try and get it
on a garage lift to do it.

I know you don't want it too high because the tranny will run hot
and long term it could become damaged.  Too low condition should
be obviously bad - won't shift and you can damage stuff way sooner.

I think they warn in the manuals to beware of constantly having to 
add fluid (/leaks).
