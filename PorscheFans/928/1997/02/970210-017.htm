Has anyone retained these messages? If so, check the headers for a line like this:

>Message-id: <2.2.32.19970211230245.0071d2e8@tenmail>

And see if they don't all match. I have a filter in place which deletes all duplicate Message-id:'ed messages and haven't seen anything but complaints about the duplicates.

In any case, the clues to the problem lie in the message headers.
