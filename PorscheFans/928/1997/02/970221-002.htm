John,

This only happens when the car is warmed up?  Did the car ever make a
whinning noise?  I my car it sounds like the altenator or something like it is
whinning...   I was told in my car that the tub that holds the drive shaft
bearings are going.  And, when they finally go that there will be a
grinding noise.  I was told this by my mechanic, who owns a S4, he
knew because it happened to him.  Told me that I can expect to pay
somewhere in the neighboorhood of $800 for a rebuild from
928-international, plus another $800 in labor, because the transmission
has to be dropped out of the car.  And, that it takes 928-international at
least two weeks to rebuild the tub shaft.  Sounds great, hey?!?!  My only
consolation is that it can take a long time for the bearing to go bad. 
Sounds like maybe your bearings are bad...  Just an idea...

If I where you, I wouldn't drive the car AT ALL until you have someone
look at it.  You'll find yourself causing more damage and costing yourself
more money.

Hope everything works out,

Matt Butler

I have an 84 928S, w/ the automatic transmission.  Once warm, the
transmission makes an unpleasant grinding noise when shifted from
neutral to drive.  The only driving I have done is on the highway, mainly
because I have not had the chance to take the car to a mechanic, and I
hate to put it into
Drive more than I have to until I have this problem fixed.  The car has
40,000 miles on it.  Would it be possible to ruin a transmission so quickly?
 

Has anyone ever come across this problem before?
Any suggestions would be appreciated. thanks,
-John
