	You will have to take it apart further to unvestigate, but first make sure 
the jig is making positive contact with the driving portion.

	This should only work with the doors open, and the wires come off the switch 
preety easily, and are close enough together to arc if not set properly. Just 
remove the covers on both sides and check your connections. Then check the 
switch, then check the wiring.

	If it is a clear-coat, then you can use paint stripper, if it is anodized or 
alodined, then you can try East-Off oven cleaner spray. I used it on my 
aluminum VFR frame and it took the anodizing right off, however it did turn 
the metal blackish, but that may have been the coating being chemically 
burned. Then I wet-sanded it with 400/600/800/1000/1500/2000 grit sandpaper, 
then used a buffing wheel on a drill to do the polishing with the white rouge. 
Looks killer!
