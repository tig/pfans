I have found a supplier to sell me all the necessary equipment to polish my
own wheels.  But... one thing he recommended was to chemically strip any
finish that the factory puts on the wheels first.  

The wheels are the flat 7's and 8's stock on the '89 S4.  My previous '85 S
had the wheels already polished and all I had to do was to rub them down
with Mother's every now and then to keep them clean.  

Does anybody know if 1) there is a finish on the wheels from the factory and
2) what chemical would be best to strip them prior to polishing.  I need to
avoid etching the metal or pitting it. 

If anybody is interested in polishing thier own wheels send me a note
directly and I will give the info on the supplier and what I know about the
process. if there is a lot of interest I will post it directly to the list.

Thanks to all,

BR
