What's wrong with using a 928 as a daily driver? Why not enjoy the car
as much as possible? And why not take the long way to work so that the
thing can get warmed up a bit?

Anyway, I don't think the car is a problem in the rain (snow is another
story, though). My old Toyota hydroplanes worse than the 928. You
certainly have to be light on the right foot in the lower gears in the
wet, especially those of you with more than the number of valves per
cylinder Nature intended the IC engine to have, but I suspect that
your problems are just a matter of the tires. I've driven in the rain,
on both street and track, on Dunlop SP8000's and didn't find anything
particularly alarming happening. Not unwarrantedly alarming anyway.
