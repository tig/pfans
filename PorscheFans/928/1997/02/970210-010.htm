The catalyst is not "a glorified filter".  It is a chemical product
that makes the reaction oxidizing the NOx and CO faster and more
complete.  This chemical can however be contaminated (ie, you cannot
use leaded fuel with a catalyst).

Just a few possible problem:

Have hou had a tune up lately?  Maybe you are running too rich or
your Lambda sensor needs replacement.

I am fishing on this one but does our vehicle equiped with an
"air pump" to supplement air prior to the catalist to assure
that enough is present for the reaction to occurs?  There is an
air filter located just next to the radiator on my 85 928S.

Sorry that I di not have a straight answer...
