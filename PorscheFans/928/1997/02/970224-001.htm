Hi, This is my first time posting to this group, but I have been reading for a
while now... and am very impressed by the thorough answers and important tips.
 Thank you all.

Last May I bought my dream car. (1986 928S 5 spd manual) I am in LOVE with the
car!!! Actually, I have been since the 80's, BUT I have had a slight problem
finding a good mechanic - which as you all know may be the single most
important part of owning these cars.  I had a mechanic, but he was overcharging
me for both parts and labor, as well as trying to convince me to replace
expensive parts prematurely.  I spent more than I could afford on the car
itself - it was worth it though - I really Love the car... But I don't want to
get ripped off by my mechanic

I live in the Boston/North of Boston area - and would appreciate any tips on
good mechanics in this area. Otherwise, I may have to go to a dealer (may
actually be the best solution) - I would appreciate any advise on this also

Thanks in advance,
-Bill
