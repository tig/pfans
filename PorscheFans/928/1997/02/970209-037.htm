Okay Leonard is right ( not unusual):
I recently (December) had the belt checked and readjusted on my 86 928s 
(96K) My 928 mechanic assured me that the belt looked good and suggested 
that the sensor may have been tripped by the non-spec oil filter limiting 
flow(?). Anyhow, he adjusted it and said it was okay. Now the cws is back 
on after 10 minutes at idle speeds at 97 K ( as opposed to only early and 
above 3000 rpm previously).
Q: Re: the timing belt, I assumed the tensioners should be replaced. And 
the water pump has already been replaced ( 70k). My mechanic mentioned 
rechecking the WP and the seals. He mentioned if these needed R&R, this 
would add to the cost of the repair.
How much should the basic (TB,Tensioners, ) cost to repair-parts, labor 
etc? Should he have recommended replacement at the previous service?

Should I update the tensioner ( as in the Automotion catalog) to the >88 
part?

What about the seals? 

Thanks again.
