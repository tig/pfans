The magic number is 60,000 miles - yours is living on borrowed time, if it
wasn't replaced by a PO. Assuming yours is a US model, you (probably)
won't have the disaster of pistons and valves colliding if it breaks,
but it sure will keep the car from going any further. I say probably
because the heads might have been planed; it's apparently a pretty
close thing.

Mine started making flapping noises at about 60K miles and ten years
of age, but that's just anecdotal.
