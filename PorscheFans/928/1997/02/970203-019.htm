If he does give up on his rear window wiper, I'd be interested in the wiper arm. PO put my 928S thru a carwash and ruined the cast zinc end on mine. Apparently not a service part, "replace the entire wiper arm." And its not one of those things salvage yards care to sell. If they have the rear wiper arm then they want to sell the entire rear hatch.

A rear wiper isn't an urgent item for me right now. Have given lots of thought to fabricating a new wiper end, can't hurt the one I've got.
