I am wondering where the other owners place jack stands.  The owner's manual
cautions
againts supporting the car anywhere but the jack ports, and I have personally
had
bad experience with someone using a floor jack on the suspension instead of
the
jack port.  (the whole body of the car sagged out of shape, and the doors
would
not open properly;  luckily the car gradually settled back into shape in
about
three weeks) Anyway, I am already gun shy and would like to know what works,
rather
than experimenting.  

I also saw someone comment about the pricing for the shop manuals on
microfiche
(about $30), and was wondering where I could find microfiche versions? 

Anybody know if a replacement ignition can be keyed to match the locks?  I
used
to have somebody nearby that could cut the keys, but now I live in the middle
of
nowhere and wouldn't know where to start looking.  So... I wont if somebody
already
knows it can't be done.

Automatic transmission owners:  I have the maintenance kit, but I have never
done
it myself since the shop only charges about $75 parts/labor.  Now, because I
am
living in the middle of nowhere, it might be easier to do it myself rather
than drive an hour and find someone to follow me and drop me off.  I am
looking to know
if it is a fairly simple driveway job, and if there is anything I should
watch
out for.  

Thanks all,

BR
