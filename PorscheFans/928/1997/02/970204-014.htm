Hi all,

This is my first post to PorscheFans, although I was on the defunct
PorschePhiles for a few years.

I am in Chicago and have a 1980 928 automatic with leather interior
and sunroof with 120,000 miles on it.  Unfortunately, it has a
number of problems including the following:
-Reverse gear is out
-Coolant leaks (possibly needs new pump)
-Interior is falling apart (mainly the plastic stuff)
-Dash lights, horns are intermittent
-Engine runs rough (don't know whether it's just a matter of
adjustments)

I had thought I'd hold on to it and fix things one by one as a
hobby, but this is really getting to be too much for my limited
time/capabilities/pocketbook.  To clinch it, I don't have my own
garage & I'll be losing my storage soon.

So, I am thinking of getting rid of it.  I was hoping the experts
on the list could help me with the following:
-What can I expect to get/ask for it?  I'm thinking maybe $2000
since the body is in decent shape.
-Who buys 928's whole for parts, preferably in the Midwest?  How
would the transaction work since it's not really road worthy?
-Anybody interested?

I've had a lot of fun with it, but it's become a real albatross for
me, and I'd appreciate *any* advice.

Thanks, Jeff Karandjeff, 70534.2357@compuserve.com
