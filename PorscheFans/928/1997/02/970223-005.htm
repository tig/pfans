What specifically do you have to spend, and what specifically are you looking
for.  I just bought my third 928, and focused my  shopping entirely on the
internet.  This has given me a tremendous amount of information on the prices
and mileage ratios in different parts of the country.  Where are you, and how
far are you willing to go for the car.  I am in Virginia, and I drove to D.C.
once (350 mile roundtrip), and flew to Houston once, before flying to Dallas
and buying the latest car.  There seems to be the most selection at the best
prices in Florida and California.  I was also able to find many good buys in
the midwest, but they were fewer and I didn't want to fly out if I wasn't
sure there was more than one car to look at.  Anyway, e-mail me with more
specifics and I will share what I know.

Also,  the '85 or later suggestion makes sense to  me.  If I were buying a
new 928 now I wouldn't go earlier than '85 just because I have been able to
find so many of them for a reasonable price, as compared to the slightly less
powerful '84 and earlier.  

The '85 I had with automatic would only hold 1st gear to redline if I
selected 2nd on the shift plate.  With the AT in 2nd it would hold 1st to
redline, and also would stay in first until I shifted up to 2nd, or passed
the redline shiftpoint.  

Good luck shopping, and let me know if I can help.
