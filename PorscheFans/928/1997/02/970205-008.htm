As long as the lifter pumps up quickly, I don't think it's a big deal at
all.  Many cars do this and the general recommendation has been to try
different viscosity oils & brands to alleviate it.  Some have success with
thinner weight to promote oil flow at start-up.  Others have switched
brands but not viscosity and the 'problem' went away.    If you are
enterprising you could pull the valve cover and re-adjust the lifter to
zero lash or replace the offending HLA. 

I wouldn't recommend using any additives in these aluminum engines though. 
I saw one engine that did quiet down for a while only.  Upon disassembly
everything had this weird copper/golden sheen to it.  Weird deposits from
the additive?  Blow-by?  Varnish build-up somehow?  Who knows... but it was
strange looking.

The biggest problem with a sticking lifter is if a valve stayed open
without enough clearance from the piston top- if you're lucky you have
clearance.  If you're not, then contact! Bent valve or worse.  This is
supposedly not a problem on the 16v 928 as they are non-interference motors
and a big reason why some owners (me even) are deferring replacing the
timing belt.  I don't know about the 944s'.

I once had a cam chain break on a 16v motorcycle.  The motor made a soft
whirring sound which I felt in the grips, ran rough and then quit entirely.
 I had no idea what happened and tried in vain to restart.  To add insult
to injury, it was Thanksgiving evening and the bike was only three days
old.  So the good news was I got a blueprinted motor under warranty.  The
bad news is I had to sell it after 6000 trouble free miles, some at
ultra-legal speed I might add :)  

Now that I've scared the 'valves' out of you I'd again repeat that if the
lifters aren't  really all that noisy and quiet down immediately after
starting, then it's probably no big deal.  If you're autocrossing
regularly, then it probably is.  

Try an oil change, it's about time anyways right?
Phil '84 928S
