Sent mail last week regarding the servicing of my car, and
> what it cost etc.  Just wanted to add that it had gone back
> to the dealer/workshop to try and fix the rough running problem.
> The cruise control problem, you may remember, was not entirely 
> 100% but a lot better than before it went into the workshop.
> 
> Even though the dealer did charge a high premium for the service,
> they were very thorough in their search to fix problems, and seemed 
> to ask the right questions for various problems.  The cruise control
> problem has been with the car since purchase, and although the warranty
> expired in May 96, they have agreed to repair/replace parts for it
> under warranty.  At this stage, they have been unable to induce the
> engine to run roughly.  They have been trying on a dyno, but of course,
> the best tests are always in the real world.  It seems to start this
> rough running while in traffic, and where the heat build up is constant.
> 
> I am looking forward to getting the car back and having everything run
> perfecty - because once these few last problems are remedied, apart from
> some visual imperfections (the odd scratch, wheels that need refurbishing)
> the car will have no faults.  Even now, after the service, it was amazing
> to drive it and feel how tight it was - almost like a new car.
> 
> Its a great feeling owning and driving a Porsche, and we are all truly very
> fortunate.  God willing, long may it continue to be so.
> 
> Hope you all have a good weekend.
