Sad to hear your car may have traveled it's last miles together...  There's
a bunch of dismantlers in excellence mag...  You'd probably get more money
if you parted the car out but that's a lot of hassle and time-consuming.  

As a sample I've seen:
front fenders $495 each
16v motor  $1900
AT  $2500
etc .

Good luck,
Phil '84 928S
