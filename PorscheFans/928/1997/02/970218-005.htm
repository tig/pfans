     I had the same problem with one of my 928's.  It is more than likely 
     the external temperature sensor which is located under the left hand 
     front wheel well.  It looks like a metal ring with electrical 
     connections.  It could be that the connection is just bad, which was 
     the case for me, and using a bit of WD40 is a real simple and very 
     effective fix...
     
     Cheers,  Jan

<X-FONTSIZE><PARAM>12</PARAM><FONTFAMILY><PARAM>Espy Sans</PARAM>Hi
guys


I have a couple of problems with my car, which someone can hopefuly
enlighten me upon.


My first problem is the air con, or more accurately the centre vent. 
When I accelerate (even gently) the centre vent closes, and dosen't
open again.  If I turn the selector to the 'eco' position the vent
will open again.  I can then move it back to aircon and it will work
until I accelerate again.  The air con unit works fine (heaps of cold
air).  I gather it must be vacuum driven somewhere along the line -
has anyone done this before and can give me a few pointers?


Second (and a related problem) is the temperature setting.  If it is
on minimum (18c down here) then it gives out cool air, if it is on any
other setting (ie > 18.5c)  it gives out full heated air. I assume it
is some kind of temperature  sensor but I have no ideas where it may
be - any tips, hints, solutions?


Finally I have noticed the front right inlet manifold is a little
dirty - looks like oil.  The car's oil level dosen't change much and
it seems to be since the hot weather.  I haven't seen it before, and I
am thinking that it may be the oil breather - anyone had this problem?


One last thing.  Is there any book or manual that gives an overview of
how the various systems work on the 928?  If I knew exactly how the
various systems function then I would be able to diagnose problems
myself.



Thanks guys
