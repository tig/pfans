	You're welcome! Works great doesn't it. It kills spiders too! Did the anodize 
turn black?

	I noticed Sears has a polisher on sale for 49.99 this week. It is in the 
Sunday insert (Mecury News).

D.  Since the Eastwood compounds are almost rock solid, I couldn't just rub
a towel on them and keep going.  Lucky I had those Maas polishes, which are
soft pastes.  It took alot of elbow grease, but wheel #2 turned out just as
nice as #1.  Will have to really check during the daytime.

	When you are all done try using some impregnated cotton (ouater, pronounced 
water I think it is called something else now, I got mine at Stupid Shops 
(Super Shops).

Phil, 
If you are holding out for a n S4 5-spd, why not make it a black one with 17" 
rims & tires, if you don't trust me, just ask Leonard, it's worth it! I will 
save one of my sub enclosures for you if you like. 

We need another macro/micro-brew night!!!!! 


Talk to you later,
