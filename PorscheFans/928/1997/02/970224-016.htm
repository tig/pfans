PCA upholstery tech session in NorCal

"... Hugo Sanchez at the very well respected Sid's Upholstery... going to
buy us a donut and give us the latest on keeping those pretty Porsche seats
looking good.  He'll also give us the lowdown on repairs.  If your seats
are dead, he'll have a few suggestions on either bringing them back to life
or replacing them with something your wallet would rather not talk about.

date:  Saturday, March 1
time:  10:30 for donuts & kibitzing, 11:00 for the show
place:  Sid's Upholstery, 1917 Old Middlefield Rd., Mt. View
ph:  415-969-1539

rsvp with tech chairman David Blanchard at 408-745-7870 to reserve your
donut."

ps.  
Don't forget to support your local PCA, which brings you these tech and
driving sessions!
