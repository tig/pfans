     I love the stock look of the 928 and have a very hard time adding or 
     deleting anything on the car. So no sticker. With the new exhaust 
     system everybody knows I am not stock :-)

     Now for the hard part, who wants to coordinate putting something like 
     this together??

     Very clean and well done. He did a great job with the installation as 
     far as I saw.
