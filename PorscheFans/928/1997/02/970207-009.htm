Hi Don - 

I live in San Francisco too and too bad you just missed our Microbrew night
at Gordon Biersch!  You would've had the chance to meet and talk with alot
of 928 owners & Susan and Mark from Devek.  Let me recommend you take the
car to Frank Siam(?) who owns Auto Sport Haus, Porsche specialists on Pine
Street for a checkout prior to purchase.  I would not recommend Andy at the
Stable because I once used them for a checkout on a 911 and instead of
cylinder pressures and leak down figures they gave me a B.S. cosmetic
review, spilt water while topping up the battery and caused a short, thus
killing my horn, signals, windows etc.  I don't think they know anything
about 928's either.  Not trying to flame here but imagine needing to honk
in a traffic situation but can't, then trying to signal but can't, then
trying to open the window to signal but can't, and getting charged for that
'work' .  

The ultimate 928 shop if you don't mind driving a bit, is of course, Devek
Performance in Belmont.

Re: your maintenance list
These can be hard to work on cars due to the cramped packaging, requiring
lots of time and special tools.  For example, the timing belt change
requires a special belt tensioner tool that may be more money than you'd
want to spend.  I congratulate you on any maintenance you've done on the
Fiero but you are graduating to a whole new ballgame and price range with
the 928.  You should be able to do most of the basic stuff no problem.

That's kind of a lead in to putting a fair valuation on that car, as any
possible future repairs could wipe out it's value completely and you'd be
better off leaving it alone.  No kidding.  In any event I've seen '84 928S'
between $3,500 (really poor condition too) to $14,500 (sometimes poor
condition here too!).  The good news is that your friend has had the car
for awhile and you should know it's history better than a total strangers
car.  But that is no replacement for a thorough diagnostic check, OK?

I don't know how much he is asking for his car but take your time to check
around.  And know that a properly maintained 928 can be a powerhouse car
for many years!  My '84 928S has 144k miles, recently dyno'd at just under
200 rear wheel horsepower (I'm sure more now after mod's) and has gone 140
mph (4,000 rpm's in top gear with lots more to go).  For comfort and
low-end grunt, the 928 has it all over the 911 but they are designed
differently.  

Hope to meet you someday - keep watching the list for the next microbrew
get together!
Phil Tong
