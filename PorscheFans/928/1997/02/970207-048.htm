John is right... the letter in front of the "s" is critical for Porsche
VIN #'s    e=1984 f=1985 g=1986  etc.

The Way to tell the difference by looking at the ball joint support
is....the new version takes on a more hour glass shape.  The countour of
the edge of the support tapers in between the mounting holes.  Also and
the bigger hole is further from the ball joint.
