John,

Yes!  there is a torque converter in front of the transmission.  If you are
familliar with the way and american V-8 and transmission connect
together, just imagine a 5" - 6" tube containing the drive shaft in between
the engine and the torque converter.  My torque converter is leaking and
was told that the seal needed to stop the leak is $12, but getting to it is a
different story.  I am going to wait for a couple of months to do the drive
shaft repair(if I can).  I'll let you know how your repair goes...  Let me
know if you find you problem.

Va. Beach.  Sounds nice.  I am currently living the the DC area.  Have a
good friend that is a beach bumb down the Va. Beach.  Lives on a boat
and is a High School English teacher.  He really loves it down there.  I
hope that you enjoy it as well.

Good Luck,

Matt Butler

Matt,
Yes, the car only makes the grinding noise when put into Drive and once
it is warmed up.  I don't think there is a noticably loud whinning noise
coming from the drive shaft tube, but I have noticed it isn't exactly silent
when the car is running.  I know very little about how the drive shaft
connects to the transmission, but I am positive that's where the grind
comes from.  Is there a torque converter in front of the transmission?

No problem on driving the car.  The weather pretty much keeps me from
doing that anyway (live in Northwest Ohio.)  I am moving to Virginia
Beach in a couple of weeks though, and I had planned to have someone
look at the car once I get out there.  I'll only have to drive it into the back
of the moving trailer, so it should be okay.

Thanks for checking on the cost of rebuilding the tube.
Sure hope it won't be too expensive if that is the problem

-John
