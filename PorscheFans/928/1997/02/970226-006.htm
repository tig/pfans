The 928 has various jack points depending on if you are using a floor lift
vs. spare tire jack.

Floor lift front - Under your car there should be a round jack point on
each side.  The hockey pucks come in handy here.

Floor lift rear -  Same thing here forward of the rear wheels, however
these aren't round but are shaped like a ball to fit in the floor jack
cradle.

Spare tire type jack front - the jack should have a U shaped bracket which
stradles the rib that runs the entire length of the car side body.  The
front jack point is close to the round lift point also, forward of the door
joint.  Do not place the jack anywhere else or you will bend something.

Spare tire type jack rear - ditto but location is forward of the rear tire,
stradle the rib.

Do not ever put jackstands on the faux frame rails!!!  They will bend
immediately.  

Clearance might be tight trying to place a jackstand when lifting the rear
with a floor lift, in that case you could put a stand under the very
frontmost part of the rear suspension arm.  Do not work on the rear
suspension with the car supported in this manner though.

Always do the shake test and double check stand locations before working
underneath the car, especially if you didn't lift it yourself!!!
