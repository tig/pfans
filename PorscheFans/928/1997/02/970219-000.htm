At the advice of the list I went ahead and had my timing belt replaced by a
local mechanic who has owned and worked on 928's for many years. He also
replaced the water pump with a rebuilt and replaced the guide roller and the
tensioner roller one of which was seised up. He didn't however replace the
tensioner itself. He claims that they will very rarely fail since the only
moving parts are disks which slide back and forth according to temperature. Does
this sound accurate? He also had to replace several quarts of lost oil which
were a result of this work. I didn't understand from where? He flushed and
refilled anti-freeze. He says it was about 7 hours labor. Total cost was around
$900. Does this all sound legit?
Also someone mentioned rechecking tension after a couple thousand miles. What is
involved to do this?

TIA
