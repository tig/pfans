You might suspect the tires themselves are throwing the balance off.  Maybe
they've flat spotted or there's a QC problem internally?  You seem to have
narrowed the search down to the rear area at least...  Would the dealer or
a friend let you borrow their wheels so you could do a road test?  If you
are in the Bay Area, I don't mind if you run my tires for a quick test
drive....

On other notes, if you hear of any manual S4's for sale, please let me
know!!!
Thanks,
Phil Tong
