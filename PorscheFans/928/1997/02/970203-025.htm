Hi all,

And thanks for all the input on the 928 GTS (ant other comments?). I will
most probably take the plunge! I finally drove the car and it feels very
alive in a different way when compared to the 911.

You see the 911 is a car that if driven with skill (not always my case), can
be quite rapid in progress. It tells you what it is up to, at least to a
certain point and once it lets lose you better be quick. It is this that
makes the car such a wonderful machine. It is a concept that is quite
anachronic in nature, but that makes for a living legend. It is a car the
any kid would recognize. My 911 is fun and fast...but not in all conditions.

There lies the main difference, I test-drove "my" 928 GTS in the wet, and
boy does that car go. It was a B road, not very bumpy but still quite narrow
and curvy. I spend about 15 to 20 minutes getting used to the less up-right
position and obviously to the size of the car. The 928 GTS is a car that
becomes smaller as you get used to it. I tried to spin the rear around a
couple of corners, and after the first fear it became clear that it is a
very compliant car. The cars limits are quite high and once you reach them
it doesn't break out wildly, but it's quite easy to catch it back. At the
same time the interiro is sumptuous, this car has the full leather option,
including dashboard and everything else. I didn't try it on the highway,
because I know what it can do. The 928 GTS has a performance/fun to price
ratio, that is very hard to beat. In my 911 fanatic opinion, this is the
most underrated sportscar in the world, and that is why one has to find its
way to my garage. It will most probably never have the aura of a 911 but it
is nevertheless (except for the new Twin-turbo and the 959) the best car
Porsche has ever build. In other words with a 911 and 928 GTS, life doesn't
get any better!

911 BTR and soon 928 GTS (apparently for my wife :)
