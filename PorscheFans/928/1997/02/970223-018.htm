I just got a set of those Borbet 17" GTS wheels from Tire Rack.  They
fit fine with the correct offset with stock size 225/45's front and
255/40's on the rear.  I have an 87s4 and really like the faux GTS look;
those 17's really fill the wheel wells up better too. And the increased
width rubber at the rear is welcome. The reduced sidewall height leads
to noticeably less squirm than with the stock 16" wheels/tires, even
when new. I can't wait until they are 50% gone.

I put BFGoodrich ZR's on and have been very pleased with them in the
past (this is my third set on the 928). I live in Seattle and have used
them extensively in the wet (as you can imagine :-) with no problems. I
actually picked them specifically because they were rated very high for
both wet and dry conditions in one of the car magazine (Car and Driver?)
shootouts a few years back.
