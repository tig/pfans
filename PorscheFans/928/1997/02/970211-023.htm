Hey All,
  I just received a letter from Patrick Hogan the "Customer Committment 
Supervisor" at PCNA. he was informed of the ball joint/arm problem by 
Werner Strunck the first person I spoke with at Porsche. The letter has a 
slightly "up yours" tone. In it he tell of the original warranty of one 
year with no mileage limit, and states the cars are extremely out of 
warranty by thirteen years or more. He tales offense at the term "design 
flaw". 

The letter itelf seems to relay the opinion that Porsche engineers their 
cars better each year, and they are not responsible for glitches in past 
cars! 

Of course after reading this I IMMEDIATELTY called Mr. Hogan and spoke to 
him about the catastrophic failures of the aluminum arm.. He finally 
agreed to talk to his counterpart in Germany. Perhaps we can get a 
resolution and some compensation from Porsche. 

It is my opinion that they are waiting till someone is killed or maimed 
due to this failure before they admit something is wrong. Thank god this 
has not happened, yet. 

If anyone who has had a problem would contact me with their Telephone 
contact information i would like to speak with you. if you have a car 
with the aluminum joint assembly Please tell me NOW! 

Hopefully, with a little convincing Porsche will fix their mistake.

Yours, 
And STILL working on it!

Richard Miller
