I am trying to pass some info along to the person looking for new tires for
an older model 928.  I lost the message with your email on it.  

I just recently found a internet special from Discount Tire Direct on the
225/50 ZR 16 Continental Sport Contact CZ for $96.00 and the shipping was
only $14.00 for two tires.  These are an excellent tire that normally retail
depending on where you buy them for about $150.00.  

They will fit all four corners of your car and the front on the later models
with 7's and 8's.  

You can contact them on the web at http://www.tires.com, or you can email me
for thier phone number which I have somewhere on a reciept.

Another good web source is a site called Autopedia, at
http://www.autopedia.com for tire mfgrs, consumer opinions, and retailers links.

I drove the car from Dallas,Tx straight back to Williamsburg, Va after
installing the Conti's and they handled very well wet and dry, were not loud
on the highway at high speed or low, and of course the price was excellent.
I was going to use the BFG Comp T/A Z4 but they were running about $175.00
each where I could find them in Dallas. 

Good luck,
