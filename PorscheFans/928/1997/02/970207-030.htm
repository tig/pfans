Axel Blickel wrote about hatch leak in '86 928 near fron lip.  I too had the
problem this year.  Tried tracing it as it came out under the quarter galss
trim on left.  No luck sealing with clear glue.  Had rubber replaced and this
did not solve problem though it prettied up the appearance.

Dealer found that leak was at the left hinge of hatch and water travel inside
trim only to exit at rear near battery ground to frame rail.  Dealer replaced
hatch gasket and sealed up hinge mounting area.  Problem solved for rain and
car washing.

Have you tried the dollar bill squeeze test on the hatch cover all around?
 Gasket may look ok, but does it seal?
