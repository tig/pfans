I am experiencing a fault reading on the on-board check system that reads:
Anti-Lock OFF.  The car is '89 S4.

I shorted the interior lights when pulling the front interior lamp to check
the bulb and had to sort through the fuese one-by-one because I don't have
the owners manual yet.  I left the key in the ignition turned to ON, and when
I found the blown fuse replaced it and the lights came on.  I then pulled the
radio to check the pin-outs on the DIN cable.  After replacing the radio, I
started the car and the fault indicator came on.  

I am not sure if I might have pulled the fuse for the ABS when I was looking
for the blown fuse.  If so, the ignition was on, and the ABS probably
recorded a fault.  Or possibly I knocked something loose when I pulled the
radio.  

I did check the ABS and it isn't functioning.  Could I possibly reset the
fault (if it is induced by the fuse scenario) by pulling the ground on the
battery overnight and letting the systems reset themselves?

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

BR
