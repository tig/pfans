Right on! The Continental CZ91 is a really good ultra-performance tire, one
of two tire types supplied as original equipment by Porsche on 928 GTS (the
other being my admittedly-expensive favorite, the Michelin Pilot SX MXX3),
and widely available for remarkably low prices.

Their one drawback appears to be even more rapid wear than is typical of
super-speed tires.

Comp T/A tires do not appear to be suitable for 928s in terms of steering
response and grip characteristics, and are simply not made as well as the
Contis, Michelins (one of their particularly strong suits), Bridgestone
S-02s, Yokohama AVSs, etc.
