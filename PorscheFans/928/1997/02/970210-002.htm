Hello -

My '85 Porsche 928S just failed its emissions.  Specifically, this was the 
IM-240 test and it failed the NOx portion (Oxides of Nitrogen).  Please note 
the following:

          Test '95  Test '97  Max. Allowed
HC (grams/mile)     0.15 0.30 2.00
CO (grams/mile)     0.3  2.1  30.0
NOx (grams/mile)    0.2  4.8  3.0 (failed)

I included data from my most recent test ('95) for reference - I had 139K 
miles at that time.  I currently am at 158K miles.  Aside from this, the car 
is in great shape, does not lose oil, and has never had a problem with 
emissions in the past.

Does it make sense that this is NOT the catalytic converter losing its 
efficiency?  I say this because of the extreme rise in the NOx reading from 
'95 to '97.  My impression of a catalytic converter is that it is a 
glorified filter and would thus, degrade slowly over time.  I'd think that 
two years and 19K miles would not cause it to fail so abruptly.  I'd 
appreciate any feedback on what may or may not be causing this problem. 
 Thanks!

Michael
