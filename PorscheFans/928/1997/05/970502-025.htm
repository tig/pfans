I've just read about 20 or so messages after subscribing to this area, and
I have to say i am impressed with your collective technical knowledge. I
would like to begin by saying that I am a 20 year old computer technician,
who makes just enough money to support his habit (fast cars), but not
enough time to really learn too much about the vehicles that I drive so
hard, mechanically. (so forgive me if I say something stupid - my expertise
is TCP/IP not STP)

I just recently bought (a beat up version) of the car of my dreams. Its a
78' 928 - with matching numbers as far as i can tell - I believe the vin#
is 9288200060. The previous owner seems to believe its the 60th 928 they
produced. The car drives and handles nicely - but needs cosmetic
restoration which is about all I am capable of doing without bringing in a
mechanic. What I would like to know from you if you had the kindess or the
time, is the following : (consider the car is a 78' manual 5spd
transmission, 160k miles, all of the moving parts are stock however it
supposedly has an enlarged oil pan and modified racing exhaust from the
headers back not including the headers)
1. What octane gasoline should i put in it? Any recommendations on brand? I
have always been partial to mid-grade Texaco gas for my other cars, but I
would gladly switch if any of you felt strongly about another brand or
another octane for this car.
2. What weight oil should i put into it? I dont want to burst any bubbles
but i read in consumer reports that all synthetics are created equal -
brand isnt important, but I dont have any clue what viscosity to run in
this vehicle.
3. Is running a teflon additive (such as T-Fal) a good idea? I have a
nissan pickup with 360k miles that says it is, but you are the porsche guys
so tell me what you think.
4. Is there any benefit (without getting carried away) to putting any
assorted 'performance mods' on this car - like a K&N air filter, or
'hot-chipping' the brain? Thus far its the fastest car I've owned but i
would be curious if I could make it run a bit more efficiently.
5. Lastly - is there ANY value whatsoever to the fact that it is the 60th
one produced? I am saving up for a paint job right now and am wondering if
I should keep it factory (brown blech) or go with a dark blue with
clearcoat)

Thanks alot  appreciate any input.
