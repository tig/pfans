Hi my name is Tim Rollins, I read your post. I didn't know how to reply
so
I am writing you directly. I had the same problem with my 1986 928s. I
thought it was the coolant tank and I replaced it only to find out that
was
not it. Finally I checked out the heater which is right behind the
dashboard and This is where my trouble began. The windshield wiper
reservoir drains on the passenger side, which made it look like the
anti-freeze tank was leaking. The real problem was that the heater hoses
which connects to the heater had swelled and burst. The hose cost $30.00,
but the problem is in replacing it. I had to remove my front hood, then
remove the lower windshield stripping, then remove the windshield wiper
motor and wipers also. I then remove the rubber hose. While I was in
there
I replaced all hoses, so I would not have to go through this again.
Hopefully this bit of knowledge will help.

I can't figure out how to post so if you would like to share this with
other 928-philes. I'd appreciate it.
