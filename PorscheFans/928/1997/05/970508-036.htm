Summer's here and thoughts turn to motoring and music!!
Thought I'd share a few thoughts as well as a couple of questions.

I replaced the 5inch factory Blaupunkts which fire onto the rear jump
seats with a couple of 6" MD QUARTZ - currently only driven by my
NewOrleans CD player - sound is still good - although the speakers could
handle (when my budget can handle) amp delivering 100watts.
Sugguestion from the install shop was CADENCE amp mounted on the back of
one of the jump seats.  Interesting to read about the CD changer, etc
that someone mounted in their 928 - one thing is sure - this car is
short of nooks and crannies to hide amps, etc.

Question:
 A/C - a while ago my A/C would blow a gale when placed on the
rectangular white mark - now it is just the same air force as any of the
other marks - could a damper be stuck??

Stuttering car problems
I too had the stutter, as if starved for fuel or air, and checked out
the AIR PUMP filter - it was filthy with bugs, etc.  Replaced it and the
car runs sweetly.  Perhaps this will help anyone who has exhausted the
other routes of fuel filter, etc.
Keep up the dialogue - this is the best info source on the NET!!

It's time to fess up.  I not only uses cleanly pressed, laundered and 
perfumed towels but I throw them away after one use! :-)

As you all know, I'm in the process of restoring my '83 928 S.  The PO 
didn't take care of the paint very well.  After receiving a quote of 
$3,000 - $5,000 for a quality paint job, it wasn't hard to make the 
decision of painting it myself.  Why am I saying this?  Because the 
quality of your paint does make a difference in the value of your 928.  
NEVER TAKE YOUR 928 TO A CAR WASH!

Hope you get your S4 soon!
