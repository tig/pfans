Whoa there...

Please note my lighting upgrade included new lead crystal lenses which
feature the flat, sharp light cut-off optics (and in the proper pattern for
U.S. driving side - low on left, higher on right for each individual lens)
so as NOT to blind oncoming drivers (when properly adjusted which should go
without saying)...  And yes, I do use my 130watt highs very judiciously as
they are extremely efficient.

With these mod's I am availing myself (and others in a round about way)
with the safety of improved illumination vs. the archaic sealed beams the
car came with (not Porsche's fault but our own DOT).  Note I've never
advocated the misuse of these lamps either - I am a glasses/contact lens
wearer, as well as know first-hand about reduced night vision of the
elderly from my father.  Matter-of-fact, it was for his poor night vision
that I started finding alternative lights for his car - and you can bet
that he insisted they be properly aimed! 

I remain in favor of improved nightime visibility through quality optics
and technology.
