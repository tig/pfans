Hi there.

I take it your friend wants the look/ price of an older model 928but with
the power of later models? My suggestion is basically try and track down/
import a European specification 928 S or S2, or else get the engine from
one of these and put it in a US Spec. model.Why? Because a European 928S
with 16 Valves from 1981 onwards has 300bhp and 284lbs ft... straight out
of the box! An output not matched by US models until the 32V S4 came
along.Tell your friend good luck; these are truly fantastic cars in every
sense of the word.
