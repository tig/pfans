Drew,

  Devek (1-800-598-0693) lists the Borbet GTS replica wheels (17x7.5&9).
  I think these are the same wheels that are available through Tire Rack,
  so if you're looking for something else, you may be out of luck.  There
  are a very limited number of wheels that properly fit the 928.  BTW,
  Devek also offers a mesh wheel (similar to a BBS RC Ultralight) that
  looks sharp (IMHO).
  
  If you do change wheels, would you be interested in selling the rear
  8x16s that you're going to take off?

Now, folks there is still a possibility that the oil pressure gauge is 
off calibration.  I mention this because at one time, my voltage gauge 
register 11 volts whereby in actuality it is 13 volts as measured with 
a Fluke digital voltmeter.  I took off the gauge and "recalibrate" it 
to reflect the proper voltage.  Something to think about...
