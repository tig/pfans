Well, David. Now that you mention it, the $47 was for a key with a 
Porsche logo on it. $25-ish was the price for just the metal part, but
that is ridiculous as well. 

The parts man said it was a special "laser-cut" key. Huh? Why do we 
need a "laser-cut" key just to open the door and start the car? As best 
I can tell, my 928 key does not do anything any differently than any 
other car key I've ever had. I expected Porsche ownership to involve
higher costs, and I don't mind paying higher costs for high-performance
parts, but a laser-cut key that costs a minimum of $25? Seems excessive.

Sorry for the rant,
