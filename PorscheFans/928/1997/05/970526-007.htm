Hi All!

Roy Vernik asked about the air pump on the 928's being important to the running
of the car. His mechanic told him that the air pump is quite expendable
with performance gains to be had by cutting the belt.

Yes, Roy, the air pump can be dispensed with. Its purpose is to inject fresh
air into the exhaust so as to burn any excess hydrocarbons. Without the air
pump, you will be pushing those unburnt hydrocarbons out of the exhaust pipe
and into the atmosphere - naughty! I am speaking about non catalytic
converter equipped cars here and of "Euro" specifications. It is common here
(in Australia) to remove the vanes from the air pump when it reaches the end
of its service life and just use it as an idler for the fan belt. I have
gone one step further and removed the fan as well and replaced it with a
large electric one. Call me old fashioned, but I reckon that doing anything
to tidy up the mess of plumbing on these motors is a good idea.
