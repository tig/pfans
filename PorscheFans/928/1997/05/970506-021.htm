All I would have to order are 1000 pairs of each, possibly down to 500 pair
for the rear 6" since there are fewer of these in the car.  I have used off
the shelf, and I didn't find anything that fit well, and was reasonably
priced.  I don't think I saw anything, for any price, that would drop in.
 Since the ohm loads on the stock wiring are complex, the only way to drop in
a speaker replacement is install new cable, or to manufacture a speaker with
the proper ohm load to begin with.

You're right, but I was talking about a drop in for the speakers, not for all
speakers and a subwoofer too.  

I inverted my spare tire, and mounted the amp for the sub in the trunk under
the mat in the bottom compartment above the battery, in the center of the
spare wheel.  This space wasn't being used any way.
