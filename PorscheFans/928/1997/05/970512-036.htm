Oh, my word!!!! I just drove by my local European Porsche Body Shop and, low
and behold, there is a crashed boxster. It is interesting, a few weeks ago
there was a 928 S4 that was in a horrific crash, front, sides, rear, etc. The
doors still both opened, the rear deck opened, the hood opened. I was told it
was the second time in for this 928 owner, who walked away from the crash,
bruised (emotionally, they had to total his baby). The new Boxster - NOT
!!!!. This car looked horrible, like it was imploded on the front pass side,
side & rear, as though there was no unibody under the outer sheetmetal. Has
this car been crash tested yet? At what speed? . The gentlman at the body
shop told me the 928's are built like a sherman tank.( perhaps Panzer?).
Well, anyway, let us 928 owners lift a glass and toast to the best car
Porsche ever built, all 3500 well built pounds of it! Cheers!
