Roy- It is true that removing the belt from your air pump will result in more
usable horsepower for your car.  However, you can only do this if you have
removed your catalytic converters.  If you cease air pump function on a
converter equipped car your engine's computer will not appreciate it.  If you
live in an area that doesn't perform emissions testingf I highly recommend
purchasing a "test-pipe" for your car and then taking it for a prolonged
"test."  It will increase throttle response, performance, fuel economy and
will increase the level of that great 928 sound.
