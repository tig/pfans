Subject: 5 speed vs. Auto: A Confession of Doubt...

My $0.02 on the topic:  We all know the 928's myriad strengths, and both
automatics & 5 speeds share them: power, torque, speed, grip, unbreakable
strength, monster brakes, multi-dimensional capabilities, etc.  The Porker's
weaknesses are less often discussed by we converts, and as a recent buyer
(Jan. 97) I am still very aware of the big fella's shortcomings, which,
IMHO, the transmission decision affects.

I think the lack of drama in the 928 will always keep a 911 in my
garage--alongside my 928.

The amazing thing about the 928 is that the faster you go, the smaller it gets.

At speed, it's a very agile car.

And on a given piece of road (the esses at the 13400 block of Mulholland
Drive, f'rinstance) I find I can exit about 7 mph faster with a 32-valve
928 than with any 911 up to the 993.

On a challenging windy road like that, if you become distracted or
inattentive, or come across an unexpected obstacle at 8/10ths in a 911, and
you'll be hard pressed to recover gracefully. The 928, OTOH, is what they
call a 'forvgiving' car: balanced, capable, and with enough power and
braking to handle whatever comes along and make you look good.

Rob, I suspect you'll regret selling the 928. Maybe not now, but soon...
and for the rest of your life--or until you buy another. I've always forund
that 928s bring very little when you want to sell, but are a little pricey
when you go to buy... If you have a good one, hold on to it.

P.S. Another aspect of the 928 is that I find it draws far less attention
(both positive and negative) than a same-year 911, which makes me more
comfortable parking in marginal neighborhoods with the 928...
