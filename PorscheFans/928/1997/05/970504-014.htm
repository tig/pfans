>The lever does not "load" to neutral but simply reduces the throw of the
shift.

>It is as easy to install as your factory lever as it is desinged as a direct
>replacment.
>
>The top guide rod is simply used as a pivot point and is held in its
>vertical position by a guide just forward of the shifter opening. The rod
itself should really only rotate. The lower rod does actually move down
>yet it should not bind anywhere.
>
>I have the shifter installed on an '80 Euro model with both the factory
>leather and the factory rubber boots and it works quite well.
>
>The only real pain is trying to use the old nylon bearings. I replaced mine
>and there is little or no play left in the mount.
>
>By the way Vince, your mod (and your freind's) should work to effectively
>reduce throw...but once you 'hack up' your factory peice, there is no going
>back!

>FYI, my piece is by no means a "hacked-up" piece. Both the factory and the
>'final' lever have been dimensioned and blue printed and their shift
>geometries modeled. The lever is fabricated from 304 stainless and is welded
>on a jig to ensure parallel placement of the bushings. The cylidrical
>extension for the aftermarket knob is notched for added stregth. It is then
>cleaned and lghtly polished...its very nice.
>
>As needed, I will have more fabricated and will sell them at cost. Since
>there are no economies of scale here, I would expect them to be around $200
>+ shipping but I'm not certain at this point.

>>I've heard that Porsche changed it to load in neutral in later models.

>>By the way, I think Steve's shift kit really sounds like the "right"
