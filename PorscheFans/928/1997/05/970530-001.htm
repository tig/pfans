OK.  I knew this would come in handy one day.

First, let me say that I am very sorry to hear about your loss, but you
may be in the driver's seat (as it were.)

Almost 4 months ago, I was driving along Comm Ave when a drunken
pedestrian presented himself in the road.  Rather than create a news
story, I swerved and lost control of my sparkling Ocean Blue Metallic
944S. It proceded to run up on the the 7" tall granite curb at about
30-40 mph.  POP went the air bags and BEND went the new C2 turbo wheels
(OEM, not replicas...) and SNAP went the A arms etc...The car was
totalled.

Originally the insurance company wanted to give me a whopping 7k for my
car.  It had 3.5k worth of new wheels and tires, not to mention that it
was a PERFECTLY maintained car and the high book value was 10k.  Of
course the insurance company is a business and they want to save some
money.  Anyway, I rejected their first 3 offers and suggested my own
figure.  Each time they came back with a little more money, finally
saying 8.7k is as high as they would go.  Then, I went to the dealership
from whence the car came and had the sales manager go to bat for me.  I
gave him copies of ALL of my receipts and records, and pictures (THIS IS
VERY IMPORTANT!!!!) I told him what I wanted, he looked in his books and
added some money for "betterments" (the wheels and tires) and tax (you
get sales tax back) and we agreed to let him deal directly with my
insurance company.  1 week later I had a check in my hand for $11,389.69
I had the option to purchase back my wrecked '44 for $1500, but I knew
the car would never be the same again.  So I took the money and bought
my S4.  I would suggest a similar thing for you.

Also, it is my understanding that the PCA will provide "real world"
valuation info for its members.  Don't settle for a low ball from your
insurance company, and if you can get one, have a third party do the
negotiations for you.  You still have the final word on what settlements
you will take, but it is much easier for you and you have more leverage
when you have receipts etc.

Good luck with "the Man."
