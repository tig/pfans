Martin,

Hey keep me informed about your interior search.  I am tossing around the
idea of getting a '79 or '80 Euro spec w/ 3sp auto, the big problems are that
the interior has been totally wasted, it needs paint, and the biggest problem
of all is a rear main seal leak....

I was thinking racing buckets and 5 points for the front and then dash covers
for the cracks, a carpet kit (preferably cheaper even than what you have
found but better quality...don't know where I might come up with that
however), reupolster door panels and back seats...

Painting project for grandpa and me so that part is not a problem.

Rear main seal anyone?  Has anyone done this or have any ideas on it.  Sounds
like a problem that would not be worth sending off to have done but if a few
friends and I took about 2 or 3 weeks to do it, the car might be worth
something...

I could get the car for about $2500...is that to much or about right for a
Euro in this condition?

Happy motoring...
