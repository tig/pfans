Why not??  Would you just need to bleed the cluch afterward??

I was told not to do this by my mechanics.  Did you rebuild all your
brakes?  I
think I remember people saying that it is very hard to get the pistons
back in
when you take them out.  The rear pads and disk are new.  I did not
install my new
front pad yet.

Would GRCI let you write down the procedure for changing the master
cylinder
and rebuilding the calipers??

If you can, I will included them in the FAQ I am building.
