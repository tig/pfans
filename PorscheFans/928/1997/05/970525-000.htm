<< To add my own opinion, Porsche already has experience watercooling the
 flat 4.  Some of their race car had 4 valve water cooled heads... 
 Putting
 these thing into production should not be too hard for the folks in
 Weissach. >>

Stephane:

That is definitely not a question of being hard - it's a question of
economics in production. The reason why Porsches had become so incredibly
expensive was because every product line was totally different. Wendelin
Wiedeking, the current President set out to get the cost under control, and
he will continue to do that with the new 911. So don't set your hopes for a
V8 911 too high...
