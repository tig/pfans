You should have a tow hook in your tool kit - maybe it would've helped
for what you were doing.

I did mine - it's a pain, especially the RHS because the fuel line and
air pump valve (??) are in the way but it's certainly patient DIY
material.  Even with a healthy PCA discount, parts are about $100 - 2
gaskets, 8 spark plug seals, and 26 grommets (@~$1 each).  My '87
grommets were way hard and leaking so you probably don't want to skip
them.  The cam hole seals for the head (Qty. 6) are also pretty
expensive since there's updated parts $30 + ?? (my SO's picking 'em up
now).

Best,
