> I've just been in contact with my local Porsche dealer to ask about a
child seat for your 928. Yes they can get them (Part nos. 000 802 021 00,
000 802 031 00 and 000 802 041 000 for reference). Apparently they are
available in either dark grey with a subtle "Porsche" logo print or with
black sides and a grey/ blue/ yellow/ pink fleck inner 

Wow this is cool Daron - THANKS for checking!!!   

I am sure Stephane will put this into the FAQ - there were at least three
inquiries before regarding child seats.

I have to admit, I was almost going for the phone myself until I hit the US
equiv. price of $225 each...  Sorry kid, Uncle Phil's buying a Momo wheel! 
:)

> Did those .jpegs of my car ever make it through to you or did they once
more get lost in the aether? Any more word on the GT yet?

re: jpg's  -  must be a file conversion problem, neither Jim nor I can
receive Mac files

re: GT  -  spoke with 'The Man' and now looking at June delivery.  

Bought the latest excellence mag and stared at 'Fat Albert' for almost an
hour.  Wait a minute.  What am I thinking?  I could never smog it in
California!  Ok, I'll keep waiting...
