Ron,

Springs:
The manual either looks confusing or suggests a different method than I
used on my S4.  As I read the manual pictures, it said to take off the
nuts in the engine compartment.  No doubt that works but it's hard.

I loosened the bolts on the front and back of the upper A-arm.  With the
strut unbolted, pivot the upper A-arm UP, move the bottom of the shock
in front of the lower A-arm, and work the thing out.  It's very tight
but mine came out (AND WENT BACK IN).

Flywheel:
The later cars are different but I don't think that different.  I bet
you have to remove the pilot shaft and the clutch (as one piece) to get
to the flywheel.  The key to this on the later single disc cars is to
keep the pressure plate tensioned with "the 2 mm spacers" (as described
in the manual) so that the clutch release arm will come off the pivot
ball.  Been there, done that for a good hr or 2.

Hope it helps, YMMV
