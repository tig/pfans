>>Also must add that the voltage in the dash pod as a volt or so less than in the fuse box, and that was a bit less than at the battery itself. Didn't see so much variation that I was concerned, but I could see the voltage swing in the dash pod on turn signal flashes more than I could see it on the fuse box. And turning on the headlights dropped the voltage more in the dash than on the fuse box.

A couple of weeks ago Scott Clapper and I were going to enlighten
the world by figuring out just how much headlight power one could
actually run using the existing wiring. We gave up when we figured
out that we don't know anything about German wiring sizes, don't
know what temperature insulation is used, etc. Too many 
possibilities. My assumption had been that Porsche probably
left generous margins in the electrical system, as they seem
to do mechanically. Now I think that's a bad assumption. In the
headlight circuit, for instance, they are using relay contacts
at approximately their rated current, with almost no margin.
Most (all?) of us see the indicated voltage drop when we turn
on the headlights or the turn signal. Lots of other electrical
problems show up on the list.

Now, given that there are probably 100 pounds of wire in our cars,
along with at least 29 electric motors, I guess it makes some
sense to use just the minimum components needed to do the job.
But I think that as our cars age, some of those components are
becoming troublesome because of the close-to-the-margin design.
So be prepared to get intimate with your electrical system.
And for those who are planning to add headlight wattage: use a
relay!

I have to agree with John.  The main purpose of the air pump is to 
reduce HC emission by pumping air into the exhaust manifolds to assist 
in burning up unburned fuel.  I saying this with no certainty.. but if 
a check valve within the air pump system is defective, that will allow 
some exhaust to backflow; thereby reducing the ability for the oxygen 
sensor to measure the exhaust content correctly.  This probably will 
cause the brain to "hunt" for the proper stoich, causing the engine to 
stutter.

"While you're down there" and found that you need to replace the 
booster, consider replacing the clutch and brake master cylinder also.  
As we all know, the clutch master cylinder is a PITA to get to.
