Hi.  i've been away for awhile. so i'm still catching up on the postings 
incase there are answers to my questions already.  My 79 928 5sp turn
signals seems to have a mind of its own.  sometimes the front and rear
lights (on both sides) work like they are supposed to sometimes only the 
rear lights work.  I've checked the fuses, the bulbs, and looked for
shorts as best as i could (the wiring is a nightmare).  is it time for a 
switch?  my car has 80300 miles on it. that leads to my next question. 
the speedometer stopped working.  the manuals are vague as to where the 
sending unit is.  Is it that round thing at the back of the tranny with
the wire coming out of it or the one in the front of the tranny with the 
wires that plug into it?  last thing (for now) where is the best place i 
could find interior parts and is there anybody that publishes the part 
numbers for my car? thank in advance
