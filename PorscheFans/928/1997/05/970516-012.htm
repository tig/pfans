Here's what I posted a few months ago.
-----


To make the brake bleeder, I started with a 1-gallon sprayer from
Home Depot. It has a plunger-type pump to build up pressure, and
a 3- or 4-foot hose with  a control valve and nozzle at the end,
which I cut off. I got a brake fluid reservoir cap from a junkyard,
from a VW or Audi. A quick disconnect came from an auto parts
store. One end of the quick disconnect goes on the hose from the
sprayer, with a hose clamp. The other end of the quick disconnect
is fastened to the reservoir cap, with the help of some pieces
from a marine hardware store (they have lots of odd little hardware
items, I don't remember what these were intended for) and a
couple of rubber gaskets. 

To use it, put a quart of fluid in the sprayer. Pump a little, to
fill the hose with fluid (a transparent hose would be nice, mine
isn't). Then put the cap on the reservoir, pump up a little
pressure, and start going around to the various bleeder screws
and bleed. If the fluid comes out too slow, pump up a little
more pressure; not too much though, I think too much may cause
problems with seals, though I'm not sure about that.

The disadvantages with the one I built are: the pump puts air
through the fluid, which could cause bubbles, though it
doesn't seem to; both the tank and the hose would ideally be
transparent, so you can know what's going on for sure; it
has been known to leak a little fluid, I think if I fail
to screw the cap on really tight. But it does the job well,
and my car has a very nice solid pedal feel.

The whole thing cost about $30. Good luck building one.
