At 5/14/97, you wrote:  Dear Rob,
This reminds me of the guy who used to run the place I work. At the time, he
drove a beamer, and was running up the canyon one night. His wife made the
mistake of telling him he was going too fast, and he replied "I KNOW this
road" and sped up (typical entrepreneur). A couple of turns later, the car
left the road and landed on the roof. He, his wife and son barely got
scratched, which was amazing as the car was flat from the front bumper to
the top of the rear window.

He went to a driver's ed class (high speed type), and discovered that what
he liked about fast cars was the feeling (true feeling!) of danger. When he
learned how to take curves safely at higher speeds than he had been able
before, it wasn't nearly as much fun.

Now I'm not saying you fit this story, just that you reminded me of this.
Maybe Porsche did too good a job?

===============================================
Steven,

By the standards I hope all Porsche pilots measure themselves, I am a
competent but not expert driver.  I have attended and passed SCCA driver's
school and raced a little bit (FV, early '70's), avoiding both incidents and
distinction.  I do not seek danger, but truly enjoy the kinesthetic
experience of controlling a car balanced near (not at) its limits... based
on road or track conditions.  The pleasure comes more from mastery & control
than abandonment.  Given the majority of my driving circumstances, and the
enormous capabilities of the 928, I seldom get the opportunity to taste this
most fulfilling pleasure.  The vast majority of my wheel time is spent
passively piloting the machine below or at the bottom of its performance
envelope.

You are correct, Porsche did too good a job.  As I said: such a thrilling
car, yet so few thrills.
