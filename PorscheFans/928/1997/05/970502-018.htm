Thanks to Jim, Vince, Stephan and John for replies on my cruise control
question.

The votes seem to be in favor of checking the rear brake lights, with
another observation that 4 or 5 ohms is probably close enough to zero so as
to not matter.

This weekend I'll replace the brake light bulbs with new bulbs and see what
happens.  I'll also clean the connector where the sensor on the tranny plugs
into the wire running to the relay board.

Since my original e-mail the cruise control has been working about half the
time.  If it works once during a drive, it will work consistently.  If it
won't work, I have no success during that single drive.  The next time I
start the car it might or might not work.  If this was a computer program,
I'd say something wasn't being initialized properly.  Or, a loose wire that
sometimes connects and sometimes doesn't.

Anyway, I'll keep you all posted.

Thanks again for the suggestions

John
