Phil-

I am bringing the camera with me outside this morning to document the alarm
install.  I have all the information, and will have all the pics, to install
alarm with remote locks, trunk release, and automatic window roll-up.  Along
with a place for the microwave interior sensor, LED, and programming
switches.  I will put together the step by step, and wiring codes, along with
the pictures ( I will probably take them into Photoshop and ad the arrows to
show what I am referring to in that step).  Let me know what size to set the
pictures up.  This will be at least a few weeks off because of a really busy
schedule for the next two weeks.  

This info applies, at the very least, to '87 to '91.  I am guessing it will,
at the very least, be very close to perfect for the '85 to '86, and I have
absolutely no guess as to later and earlier model years.  I would think both
later and earlier will be pretty close in terms of locations and wiring
colors.

Let me know if you want this for your page.
