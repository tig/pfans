Sounds like you've already dug into this pretty deeply, but here's a 
simple check that was posted on the Automotion tech tip page 
(http://automotion.com/Tipcol.html) by Kevin Mitchell Sr..  I don't want 
to violate copyrights, so I'll just summarize it to say that you should
check all of your brake light bulbs since an open circuit in the brake system
prevents the cruise control from working.

Good Luck.
