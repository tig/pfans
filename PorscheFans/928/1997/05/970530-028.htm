I have seen advertised "oversized " throttle bodies and higher "than 
stock" fuel pressure "billet" regulators.  Has anyone tried them ? If 
so - any difference in performance? Any problems with same?
I am considering this basically bolt on upgrade for my '89 928GT.  I 
tried the "autothority "chips and was dissatisfied with the 
performance.  Under soft acceleration  with these chips the car 
hesitated when the throttle was softly pressed.  I took them out and 
the problem went  away.  Under full throttle there was a bit more 
"oomph" . It wasn't worth the trade off.   

re:  blue ion bulb upgrades.  Could someone please name the sources 
for these .  I have always felt under lighted in this car.  

At 79,000 miles should I consider things like - injector refurbishing 
or other such things? Thanks in advance for your replies.   Roy
