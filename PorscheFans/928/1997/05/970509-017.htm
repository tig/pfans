Vince, you're right and I would expect that those German Engineers would
devise a sender which is not linear but instead is "calibrated" to the
shape of the pump. But in my case it appears that the gauge needle is
consistently low... that is, when the tank is full the needle is just shy
of full; when I'm at half-tank, the needle is just below the half-tank
marker; and it's almost at the bottom of the reserve area before the low
fuel light comes on. I recall my old Triplett volt-ohmmeter had a screw on
the face which I could turn and zero the needle for more accurate readings.
I'm hoping there is an equivalent screw on the gas gauge. I don't think
diddling with the sender is the right answer.

Pete

(PS I threw in that stuff about Triplett meters just to give John White a
thrill... <grin>)
