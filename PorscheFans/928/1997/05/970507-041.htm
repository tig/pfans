Lately there has been a buzz about stereo upgrades, and it comes as I up
putting in my new system.

I have replaced the two 4" speakers on the doors with Infinity Kappas 4"
Coaxials, and am powering them with my Clarion head unit. In the rear seat
side panels I have 6.5" Infinity Kappa Coaxials, powered by a Kenwood 50x2
amp. Then I have a Kenwood 120x1 mono amp driving a 10" SAS bass tube that
is mounted in the rear cargo area (on the side opposite where the spare
well is, to allow acess to the spare and battery) These amps are mounted
vertically on the back of the rear seat headrests, and they look way cool
there!

They system sounds very nice, and the whole system  cost $925 from
Wholesale connection ($180 for the Kappas, $160 for the mono amp, $150 for
the other amp, $160 for the 10" Bazooka, and $275 for the Clarion head
unit). Installation was performed by a friend of mine, who I gave $50 even
though he didn't ask for anything, and $20 for extra parts and wiring.
Total cost $995, just under $1k. I think I'm going to put in a CD changer
now...
