Brian and the Gang:

Hello fellow Porsche Fans!  Re: speakers, systems, etc. in the 928, I have
had the fun of completely re-doing the stereo in my 81 928 several times.
This car is a serious hassle to change anything in but custom speakers are
not needed.  For all 928's I have seen, the front doors have a really
shallow 4" speaker, some have a separate tweeter already.  By modifying
(cutting) the location ever so slightly, I was able to fit a deeper 4 1/2"
MB Quart speaker and separate tweeter in that location.  *Remember, you must
not have any gaps around the speaker.  In my car, the speakers next to the
rear seats are also 4" and are flush with that panel.  In that location,
there is enough depth already to fit a decent speaker (4 1/2").  As an
option, some 928's came with a plastic ring which sticks out about 1 inch
that provided for a larger 5 1/4" speakers.  Also some had speakers in the
hatch area (I believe a 5 1/4" mid-woofer).  Run ALL NEW speaker wire (high
quality 16ga.) to ALL speakers, don't mess with the zip cord crap that comes
stock.  Door speaker wires are easily ran through the plastic tube in the
door jam that contains the factory wiring.

Amplifiers are a completely different story.  The 928's come with the cheezy
little Blaupunkt amp next to the passenger seat.  This can be interfaced
with better speakers, but it's a hassle to hook up to other types of stereo.
The only other space to put an amp is in the hatch.  What I ended up doing
was building a false floor in the hatch area that raised the entire floor
about 2 1/2".  This provided necessary room for a descent amp (nice and
close to the battery and ALWAYS FUSED < 6IN. FROM THE BATTERY) and a CD
changer, which is accessed between the two rear seats.  Also, run power
wires away from signal and speaker wires, it's best to twist all wires that
you run to dissipate any engine noise or interference.

Step 3:  Ditch the spare tire and that provides .66 cubic feet for a nice
subwoofer.  Throw in the space saver and compressor for trips and you are in
audio ecstasy.  I made a nice cover with matching carpet, looks nice.

While your at it (the best part!) gut your entire interior (this is a great
time to clean all the nooks and crannys) and once your down to bare metal,
clean with soap and water and apply sound deadening material such as:
Dynamat, Road Kill, etc.  The more you apply the quieter your car will be.
Especially, the foot wells, rear hatch area, and the doors.  I was amazed at
the result in my car, it is very quiet with all the windows up even with
loud exhaust.  

As an aside, my CD player or changer never skip.  Buy a newer unit, and
secure mounting is critical.  Don't get carried away on which brand to buy.
There is alot of great equipment.  Don't buy the cheapest and don't buy the
most exspensive.  AND PLEASE, don't even think about cutting your dash for
an EQ or I will cry :-(

You might never want to get out of your car again.

Sincerely,

Sean Nauman
