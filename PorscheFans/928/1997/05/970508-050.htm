When I first got my 928S, almost paniced driving home when the voltmeter pegged. Then unpegged and read reasonable, pegged again. Finally I pulled off the road. Found the fuse box. And hooked my Fluke 77 into a reasonable 14.2 volts. Drove home that way. Dash volt meter continued to peg periodically. So the volt meter was My First 928S Project.

Have reported this earlier on this list, but the culprit was the calibration potentiometer in the dash on the backside of the voltmeter. Where its wiper made contact, the resistance substrate was worn away. Could calibrate anywhere but where the factory set it many years prior. The pot was wired as a simple variable resistor so I got out my collection of way out of spec labeled 10 ohm resistors and started hand selecting. Think I needed 42 ohms. Shortly found two resistors in series that yeilded very near 42 ohms (I *told* you they were way out of spec).

If the oil pressure meter is wired similar to the voltmeter, then a pegged meter could be due to a worn out calibration pot. Only a couple of pennies to fix, but a modest amount of labor removing the pod and rigging a test bench to exercise it.

Also must add that the voltage in the dash pod as a volt or so less than in the fuse box, and that was a bit less than at the battery itself. Didn't see so much variation that I was concerned, but I could see the voltage swing in the dash pod on turn signal flashes more than I could see it on the fuse box. And turning on the headlights dropped the voltage more in the dash than on the fuse box.
