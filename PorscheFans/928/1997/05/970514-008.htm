Hi Guys,

Thanks for all the suggestions. 

I haven't had any work done recently, other than oil changes.
About 10,000 miles ago I had the 30,000 mile service, they replaced
the plugs, and the normal 30,000 mile service stuff.

I took it to the shop today, too many other things going on to do it
myself right now. They spent 2 hours, and said the pressure is fine at the
rails, and that the spark looks fine at all the plugs. Now they want to
check the injectors. The guy mentioned that the signal to the 2,3,5,8
injectors was "funny" any ideas there? 

Another owner mentioned water in the fuel? And another friend suggested
the O2 sensor... 

What do you think?

TIA,

Lance
