See my previous post about a '88 S4 no start.  I had a no start on one of
928's that was the result of a plugged filter.  You filter is located in the
rear of the gas tank, under a cover that hides a cutout in the tank.  Filter
and pump are there.  It should be obvious when you look.  I read someones
suggestion that you should start the car with the fuse for the pump removed,
then the filter will empty, or something like that.  I think this has to do
with the other fuel pump(s) in the car.
