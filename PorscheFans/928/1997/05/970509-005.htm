Now that's original!  I've thought about a monochromatic 928 also but
burgandy wheels would be the absolute yuck...

Anyways, for wheel restoration products see www.eastwoodco.com  . I'm
plugging them as that's where I got a DIY wheel polishing kit and it works
great.  (tastes bad but works great!)

Send me a picture when you're done!
Phil
