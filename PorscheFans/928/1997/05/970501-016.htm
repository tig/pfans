Good evening, PFans. This isn't exactly a 928 question but it is a Porsche
question so I'll ask it anyway. For a number of reasons my wife and I
decided to sell  her '83 944. (We are, however, keeping the 928 S. Some
things just aren't negotiable!)

We live in VA close to the Maryland border and the buyer lives in Maryland.
As a condition of the sale we agreed to have it go through the Maryland
State Safety Inspection. I felt there wouldn't be a problem. Well, Maryland
didn't like our REAR brake pads... even though I'd looked at them 2 weeks
before and saw that there appeared to be about 1/2" of pad material left on
each pad. Looks good to me, particularly for rears.

Well, I'm having them replaced (Repco Metal Masters) but I'm still
wondering... what IS the proper amount of pad material and how thin should
it be when they are replaced? My son (the obnoxious mechanic) says 4mm is
the minimum... that seems a little low to me.

If I see 1/2" pad material on my FRONT, I would say that I have about 
10-15K miles left.  I replace mine when I see about 10mm of material 
left.  Anything less than that will give me a heart attack.  This is 
for normal driving though...
