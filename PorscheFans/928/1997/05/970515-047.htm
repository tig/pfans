The tensioner is self-adjusting only to some extent.  The adjustment is
limited to the variation between a cold engine and a warm engine.  If
your belt has any loose in it, or is not tensioned properly when
installed,
the tensioner will not help you.

Belt does need to be retension after 1,000 miles.  This is very
important as
a tensionner that fails means an engine that fails in our 32 valves
models 
(you will experience valve-piston crash).

Did your shop use the special Porsche belt tension indicator?  Porsche
(indicator), there is NO substitute...
