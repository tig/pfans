Hi All!

Kevin Jones says that "While checking the brake pads on my right front wheel,
I noticed a cylinder that is mounted at the top of the wheel well and has
various
hoses connected to it.  Does anyone know what this is?

I have just been crawling around under my 1980 928S removing 16 years of
accumulated English road grime. I purchased the car in England at Christmas
and shipped it out here to sunny Brisbane, Australia. Step 1 was to remove
the plastic covers in front of and behind each wheel (except that behind the
driver's side (RHD) rear wheel there is no cover?). Step 2 was to take the
car to a guy with a hoist and a powerful steam cleaner. Step 3 was to treat
the few tiny rust spots with phosphoric acid and step 4 was to apply a good
coat of sound deadening/rust proofing goop. Remember that I am talking right
hand drive here but behind the driver's side front wheel is the enormous
headlight/windscreen washer bottle. In front of the driver's side front
wheel are the two horns. Behind the passenger's side front wheel is the
cruise control vacuum stuff. In front of the passenger's side front wheel is
the alternator cooling air pipe which includes the outside air temperature
measuring device for the climate control. In front of the driver's side rear
wheel is the fuel pressure accumulator (cylindrical). Behind the driver's
side rear wheel is the fuel filler. Above the driver's side rear wheel is
something that I think is the fuel vapour canister. Behind the passenger's
side rear wheel is the power radio antenna. There is an unused space in
front of the passenger's side rear wheel - surely Porsche could have put
something in there!

I guess that there is a lot of space under those big guards and it couldn't
go to waste. But to answer Kevin's question, if it is cylindical, it could
very well be the fuel pressure accumulator. This device has a spring loaded
diapragm inside it which keeps fuel pressure up to the system for quite a
few hours and ensures easy starts, particularly warm starts where there is a
chance of fuel vaporisation in the lines and fuel rails etc.

The corrosion protection measures taken by Porsche are extremely effective
as my car has been driven on salty English roads for 16 years and the worst
rust spot was a half inch hole where the handbrake cable comes out of the
body. This just required treatment to stop the rust spreading but no repairs
were neccessary. After having owned many Alfa Romeos, this was an absolute
revelation!

Whoever said that the 928 was a technically intimidating car was certainly
correct! My climate control has a mind of its own and the cruise control
sometimes seems to do something. The high strength washer system doesn't
work and neither does the headlight height adjustment knob. It had its share
of faulty electrical connections, which took out some of the lights but
these are now all OK. In connection with these faults, I would love to have
some service information on the climate and cruise control systems. I would
also love to have a diagram of the washer system and, lastly, does anybody
know what type of fluid is used in the hydraulic headlight height adjuster,
is is water, is it silicon? Owning a 928 is like doing a permanent jigsaw
puzzle, it keeps you thinking!
