Steph and all,

Duplicaion of the Callaway System (even the older version) would probably=
=20
cost WAY too much money!=20

The original configuration was:

2 IHI turbochargers
2 Custom fabricated exhaust manifolds
2 Boost Guard Waste Gates
Custom Fabricated Intake ducting
a Microfueler, discrete secondary Fuel injection system
Large cross section Fule injectors
Dry sump lubrication
one dual chamber Intercooler
Engine oil cooler
Stainless steel High pressure oil feed/drain lines
Stainless steel exhaust system including muffler
Boost gauge (Gotta have THAT!)

The turbos are mounted low on either side of the block, sincle they are=20
so low they have their own oil scavanging system. It's driven by a gilmer=
=20
belt on the passenger side of the engine. They are of a low inertia type=20
generating positive pressure at 1800RPM Original Factory default boost=20
setting is 10PSI.=20

Also part of the Package was a racing dual plate clutch assembly.

The original factory Dyno specs were 550HP @ 5500 rpm with 475 ft/lbs of=20
torque at 4000 rpm. Compression is set at 8.5:1

Since the original Turbo System installation in 1984 several=20
updates/upgrades have been done. Most notably last year Callaway replaced=
=20
the wastegates with newer models that are MUCH more sensitive and less=20
prone to air leakage. The one modification that HASN'T been completed it=20
fabrication of a new Intercoold (actually 2) that allows the plumbing to=20
enter from the engine side of the unit giving me a MUCH needed boost in=20
ground clearance. The intake/exhaust fittings were beefed up with newer=20
kevlar joints and the turbochargers were removed and new impellers of a=20
more efficient designer were installed in them. The engineering staff at=20
Callaway said I can set the boost as high as 16PSI, but that just sounds=20
like a good number for engine self destruction! I currently have the=20
system set to produce 12.5 PSI and have varied it to ~14PSI on occassion.

My estimates to horsepower values are in line with the Callaway engineers=
=20
I would peg the upper limit at around 680HP Though I wouldn't want to=20
drive the car at those setting too often!

The car is in the process of a suspension/wheel/tire upgrade. Kim Crumb=20
has been invaluable in the decisionmaking process!

All that is left is to fix all the electrical gremlins caused by the=20
"James Bond" modifications done by Ultramsmith in NYC.

Pictures (poor ones) can be viewed at:
