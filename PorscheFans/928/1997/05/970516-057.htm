What this Rob? Don't you get off doing 70 mph on the freeway?? 

Like another of my sour grape Porsche fan friends remarked when I said I was
looking at a 928: What's the benefit of of driving a performance car like a
Porsche 928 if there is nowhere for it to perform? Another non Porsche owner
stated that he heard that all Porsche 928s must be *let out* once in a while
on a racetrack. Otherwise their engines becomes corrupted with *slow city
driving* engine contamination. 

What??? Is there any truth to the above? Isn't this a bit like saying you
have to turn up the volume on your stereo to full blast once in a while to
allow it to eliminated *low volume* contamination? 

Barry R. Soon with a creampuff 90' 928 S4.
