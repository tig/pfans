  Matt,

If you open the trunk and activate the opener, do you see the 
"clamp" moving inside the "trunk post holder"? (God I love my
"technical" terms...).

Anyway, if you see the latch move at the same time as the motor,
the only thing you need to do is to adjust your latch (2 screws, move
the thing either up or down...)  I never did the procedure (yet, I have
the same problem) but I am told that a little movement in the latch
goes a long way.
