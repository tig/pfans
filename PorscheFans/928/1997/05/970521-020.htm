Your Integra most certainly does not weight 3635 lbs.  This is do doubt the
gross vehicle weight rating which includes car + cargo. I've checked several
sources and they all list a two door Integra at about 2600 lbs.

However, this is really not the point.  The 928 is not heavy when compared
to similar rear-wheel drive sports cars.  The following specs were taken
from the May '97 issue of Motor Trend.

NSX-T           3164  (heavier than I would have guessed)
Corvette        3218  (GM paid attention to the weight this time)
Viper GTS       3375  (not bad for this V-10 beast)
F355            2976  (a real lightwieght for all that hardware)
3000 GT VR-4    3737  (all wheel drive takes its toll)
911 Turbo       3307  (heaviest 911 ever?)
Supra Turbo     3505  (further proof that "heavy" cars can be quick)
