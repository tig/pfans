Hello,

I received this from a friend of mine. I think you 928 guys
might find it interesting. I'm not on this list, so send any
replies directly to me (or to the author)

> Hi guys,
> Well we tested yesterday at Pocono, and it was fun.  The day started out
> with me arriving at Pocono International in the Cobra, with the team car
> running late, and rain starting to fall.  It was a mess getting the
> credentials together to gain track access, but there I was; alone in the pit
> lane, rain falling, and starting to wonder just what the hell was going on.
> 
> When the transporter arrived, my questions were answered.  The Baci Racing
> Bodymotion Car and Driver One-Lap of America  Porsche is magnificent!  Full
> credit must go to fabricator Mike Bavarro for an incredible piece of
> workmanship.  Bob Mazucuola stood by like a kid with a new toy, just dying
> to get this thing running, and Sam Wolkoff was just as anxious.
> 
> We backed it off the trailor, and there it sat for my appraisal.  The body
> is white, and fully custom.  Strosek panels are perfectly aligned, and the
> attention to detail is evident throughout.  Lexan windows, lightwieght hood,
> Fikse wheels, Pirelli P-Zero tires (bigger than some apartments I've lived
> in).  Beautiful metal fabrication in the trunk covers a thirty-gallon ATL
> fuel cell, which peaks out from under the rear valence.  Big chrome dual
> exhausts exit the rear bodywork, heat shielded.  The interior has Recaro
> seats, roll bar, sound system, brake bias adjustment and the like.  The car
> is comfortable, as needed for a non-stop cross-country jaunt.  Under the
> hood is the meat of this project. A Donovan Chevy engine dynoed at 560bhp.
> The install was as clean as could be, with special Porsche valve covers made
> to fool onlookers.  The headers are hand made and are sculptures in themselves.
> 
> Bavarro suited up and anticipation was running high.  The engine turned over
> immediately.  The car rumbled out onto the wet track and some shake down
> laps were completed.  Minor adjustments and back out.  We did this for the
> afternoon, dialing the car in, and switching drivers.  The thing just ran
> like stink all day.  Fast, reliable, and fun.  We'll test at the Bridge
> again on Wednesday.
