I had the same problem when I bought my '84 928 some years ago.  Turned out
my alternator was bad (long story).  I replaced the alternator and
everything's (at least in *that* department) been great since.

The bad news ... Porsche wanted over $990 to replace.  The good news, 928
International in Anaheim, CA, had one for about $250 (new, not used).

Replacing was easy, except I needed an offset wrench to get the pulley off
the old alternator and fasten to the new one.

Good luck!

John
'84 928S
