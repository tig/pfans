Russell,

  I looked this up in an original sales brochure that I have for an '84.  
  9999 indicates "color to sample" (or some such wording).  Basically, your
  car is a custom color that was duplicated by Porsche based on a sample
  provided by the original purchaser.  Not sure what the VK means.
  
  I saw a 928 in Austin once that was a custom color based on the original
  purchaser's favorite nail polish color!  Talk about coordinating your 
  wardrobe...!
