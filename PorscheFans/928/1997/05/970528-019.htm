hello fello 928 lovers.  i have been off line for awhile, so i'm still
catching up on the postings incase there are answers to my questions. 
My 928 5sp turn signals seem to have a mind of their own.  Sometimes the
front and rear lights (on both sides) work like they should but mostly
only the rear lights work.  I've checked fuses, the bulbs, and looked
for shorts as best as i could (the wiring is a everywhichwaymare).  Is
it time for a new switch?  I haven't replaced the relay yet.  My car has 
80300 mi on it.  that leads me to my next question.  the speedometer
stopped working.  the manuals are vague as to where the sending unit is.
Is it that round thing at the back of the tranny with the wire coming
out of it or is it the one in front of the tranny with the wires that
plug into it?  Last thing (for now) where is the best place that i could 
find interior parts (heater control knobs and stuff) and is there
anybody that publishes the part numbers for my car?  thanks in advance.
