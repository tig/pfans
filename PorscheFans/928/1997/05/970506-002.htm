Hey Brian:

You sure?  It shouldn't be pegged at idle, not when warm at least... and we
all know how long it takes 9 quarts of oil take to warm up!

I observed:
1-bar at idle, warm engine with 10/40
1.5 - 2 bar at idle, warm engine with 5/50 synthetic
Swings to 4 -5 bar with any throttle opening indicating flow, then returns
to lower reading at idle

It was noted way back that the Porsche gauge is like a 'microscope' into
the system and anything above idle should show positive pressure.  (My
gripe against this not knowing exactly what the pressure is at any given
rpm, especially if there is a problem. Don't want to blow a bearing or bolt
due to excessive pressure)

FWIW
Phil Tong
