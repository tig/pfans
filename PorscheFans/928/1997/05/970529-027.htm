Matt,

  Based on the discussions about options a few weeks ago, you have
  (IMHO) the epitome of what a 928 should be.  Why not keep it that
  way by going the route that Leonard went and have a full custom
  reprogramming of the fuel and ignition computers while the car is
  on a dyno?  Leonard can confirm this, but it sounds like it only cost
  about $400 more than the Autothority chip and the end result is more
  power than any off-the-shelf chip can give.

It would be worthwhile to get an extra tow hook since the front have 
mounting holes for two.  Couldn't understand why Porsche just gives you 
one!

Sorry to hear about your mishap.  My opinion is if you decide to keep 
it, make sure a Porsche dealer is going to do the repair.  Of course, 
if you let the insurance company salvage it, you're in for a fight as 
to the value of the vehicle.  Best of luck and let us know what 
happened!
