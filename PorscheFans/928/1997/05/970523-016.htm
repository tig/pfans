     Hi,
        Three solutions:
                1) don't let idiot parking attendents drive your car.
                2) Get bigger wheels so your car is higher up.
                3) Only eat at restaurants with low parking barriers.

I've been driving 928s since they first came out. Currently on my sixth one 
which is an 87 S4 five speed.  In the seven years I have owned it I have 
replace the front air dam four or five times.  With one exception, they were 
all broken by restaurant parking lot attendants who drove them too far into 
parking places and smashed the air dams either on the way in, or when 
backing out.  They now cost app. $500.00 plus labor to replace.  Has anyone 
come up with a remedy for this aside from not allowing others to drive your 
87 or later 928s?  would appreciate and input, as I am currently waiting for 
a new air dam to arrive for installation.
