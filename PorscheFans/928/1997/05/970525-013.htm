I have an 83 S (Euro) and have a question.  I find the low beams on my car
to be incredible, the best I have had on any car.  I find however that the
high beams are little better than my low beams (they seem to lack
penetration/distance)and would have to be the worst I have had on any car.
My car uses H4's, so I have upgraded to 90/130's, but still the high beams
lack any real penetration.  The problem does not seem electrical (I have
checked all the wiring and the light is very 'white') - is this a common
thing with 928's?  I would have expected the high beams to be very strong
on a car capable of such high speeds.

Can anyone shed any (no pun intended) light on the subject?

Adam
