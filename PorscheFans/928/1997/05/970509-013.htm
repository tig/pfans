Hey look what I found!  :)

Ok 928 fans - I need help on the "Performance" section of my webpage... 
This is the fun stuff right?  It looks like this -

928 Performance
	* Engine
		**air filters
		**headers
		**cams
		**superchargers
		**small-block conversions
		** etc. <-- doesn't say that but you know what I mean
	* Suspension
		** etc.

So anybody is welcome to join the fray by picking any topic that interests
you, do the research, get some pix,  and get a big credit on the list and
page (and yes even get the non-existant 928@porschefan window decal!) 

But most of all, add to 928 history!

Give it a try, all !
Phil
