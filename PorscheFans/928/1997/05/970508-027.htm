sorry vince.

i'm doing this from memory, so things might be a little
different.

the instrument pod has to come off. i think the console has to
come out. eventually, you get to the point where if you stand on
your head in the footwell, you can see the frame member (there's
a tube welded across the car, just below the defroster vents; looks
just like a race car)  and if i remember right, there's two socket-head
bolts on each side.

i'll look at my manual tonight and refresh my memory a bit.

how much of the surrounding stuff do you have out of the car?
