You both matched my beliefs pefectly.
I do not find much enjoyment driving my machine on the regular highways/roads.
Where in the UK, 2 lane windy roads by default have a 60mph limit, here they
are usally restricted to 35mph. I should say this is not necessarily wrong given
the average driving ability. What I was leading to is this is EXACTLY why I
joined the PCA/SCCA. To drive the car and discover its true limits is to really
fall in love with it. So much power, so much weight, yet the agility and manners
unmatched by anything else I have driven.
I find Autocrossing the perfect outlet as even pushing a car over the limit
will rarely cause harm or damage. Anyway as I've heard 356'ers say, it applies
just as much to 928's now.... Keep the Faith!
