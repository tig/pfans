> Possibly, there is another problem that has been overlooked. The linkage has a component called a "shift cup" which is mounted forward on the torque tube. This is a plastic pivot which is prone to severe wear and just plain degredation. This unit was diagnosed as bad and replaced on my 88 S4(45k miles) by "Garth" at Pioneer Porsche in San Diego. NOTE: if you place the lever in any gear and there is more than .250 movement of the lever, this shift cup is out of spec.
> This shortened the throw to total shifter motion of 3 inches. It was 6 inches. All "slop" is gone. Recommended replacement procedure is to remove torgue tube to get at this unit. However, "Garth" has devised a method of removing and reinstalling without torque tube removal. I was present while it was being replaced and you must have a lift and some special tools not found in the Porsche manuals. (read: home made)

Not the first time that this plastic adaptor is mentioned as the culprit
but you are the
only one who fully described the symptoms.  Do you have a copy of your
bill handy to tell
us the part # and a ballpark price for the part??
