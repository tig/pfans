Randy, I don't own one of these beasts yet, and I'm not sure I
understand this cam belt tensioning. Are you saying that it needs
retensioning EVERY 2k miles, i.e. 15 times in the 30k life of the
belt? At $100 a pop, you pay for that p-tool pretty quickly. I'm
hoping you'll tell me I misunderstood...
