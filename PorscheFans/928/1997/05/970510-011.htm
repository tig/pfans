The MB Quart 3-way system is the best direct replcement system that I have 
found. Unless you want to pick out several different speakers from different 
mfg's, but then you would have to find a 3-way passive x-over. Or you could 
use the stock caps, already on the drivers. Use the big one from the woofer to 
the mid and the smaller one from the mid to the tweeter. I just disconnected 
the rear 3" speakers, since they do almost nothing, except put more strain on 
your amp. I didn't notice any difference with them hooked up anyway, no one 
sits in the cargo area. As far as the MB Quart system, the woofers fit in the 
stock location - no problemo. The mid and tweeter are my next project. I want 
to be able to keep the stock screw-on grilles. The tweeter looks like no big 
deal, but the mid might be a brian teaser. When I figure it out I will let you 
know. I will mount the x-overs in the spot where the factory amp was. They can 
also be easily mounted in the doors, or on the parcel shelf(s). 
The overall sound quality will be much improved. If tou stay with the stock 
amp, you can get away with using the factory caps, but if more power is added 
I would stick with the system x-over.

This is just my buck-three-ninety-five worth.

Jim 88 S4 (Yes Phil, I am upgrading to blow away James' system.)
