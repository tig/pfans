To answer both of your questions, at least in part....I have replaced the
windshield in my 1982 928, but I did it with my checkbook--after asking for
advice from this list, and determining that the $400 I paid was relatively
cheap.  I have previously replaced a 911 windshield (in answer to the
second part of your question, there are some of us who have both) but the
928 was a totally different job--and members of the list convinced me that
it was one of those jobs best left to professionals.

Specifically regarding the 911/928 question, I have one of each currently,
and have driven both in many different types of conditions/events including
track events (the only thing I've done in a 911--while driving, that
is--that I haven't done in a 928 is enter a PCA Club Race), and I can't
think of any two cars I'd rather have--even though they are dramatically
different (moreso because my 928 is an automatic).  I hope I never have to
make a choice about which one to keep.....

Hi folks,

Has anybody here replaced their windshield themselves and are there any
little secrets to be told that would save unnecessary nailbiting? The book
makes it seem easy but then everything is easy if you do it every day!

Also is anybody on the list the owner of a 911 as well as a 928 or is that
unheard of and not to be even thought about? I'd be interested in hearing
any comments.
