Funny, I just put the Weltmeister/Koni reds on my '87 S4 (and BFG R1
tires) AND H&R/Bilstein on my '92 525i (16" tires & stock bars). 
Sequence is important here - I did the P, then did the BMW, then drove
to Lime Rock yesterday in the P (with R1's - had an absolutely great day
with the family), and then drove the BMW for the first time.  Well
there's no comparison - the BMW is plush (read soft) compared to the
S4.  Most will not want to drive the S4 into NYC everyday - and lowering
an S4 is probably not a good thing although you can make up a lot of
that with the ride height adjustment (I set mine close to the bottom). 
Certainly both cars are much better and what I've done is (so far)
perfect for us.  I do strongly advise against NOT changing your S4
shocks - mine, @ 60k miles in both cars, were leaking and nearly
useless. BTW, your front toe will change with ride height and F&R camber
(in THE good direction for the camber).

The "other" option out there is replace your fronts with the Eibach 270
lb springs (eg from Automotion) and put the fronts on the rears. 
However, I don't get this as they have very different diameters (and
lengths).  I wouldn't go for this but YMMV.

Best,
Kurt
'87 S4 5sp, R1's, Weltmeister & Konis
