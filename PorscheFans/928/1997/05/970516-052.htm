Dear Friends at 928@PorscheFans.Com:

Here is the collected response to my recent post, "A Confession of Doubt."
Apart from erudite Debra Ames, our club (at least those who post vs. lurk)
appears to be mostly a guy's club, and we all know that guys will usually
talk about things & what those things do rather than how they/we feel.  I am
most pleasantly surprised & delighted by your numerous replies.  Various
studies of leadership note that, as we climb from subsistence to
accomplishment, we leave behind the boyhood game of "stats" and begin
thinking more holistically, finally learning to accept, trust and follow our
experience-tempered feelings.  It would appear that our crowd includes many
who have made this leap.  Bravo!

Since many of these came directly to me I am posting them for all to savor,
and perhaps, to comment.  I will end this preamble with a picture (please
excuse the male weltanschaung):

        A great car is like the perfect dancing partner.
        She lets you lead but, without apparent effort,
        her every move makes you feel like Astaire.

Mornin' Rob, That was a Loverly Rant on 928s, my compliments, Sir! "Tis fair
to say that Yer Kindly Ol' Unka Bart savored every luscious word!  But the
ol' rutabaga must wonder, don't you have a first gear?  After all, you said,
among other things:

        It's been a month since I crossed 5,000 rpm...

But I'm just a "Tail-wagger" owner who still wistfully dreams of adding a
928 to the garage.. (Yer Kindly Ol' Unka) Bart

Hello,  DO NOT SELL YOUR PORSCHE!!!!  I understand the lack of playtime in
our beautiful cars.  I drive exactly 2.3 miles to work every day.  The oil
pressure barely even drops from 5 by the time I get there.  But this is why
I have just sent in my check to the PCA.  They'll have to make a new class
for me (I couldn't see the number 928 anywhere in the auto-x rules on the
web page.) but dammit I spent a lot of money and I will enjoy the car if it
kills me.  Besides, there is no shame in quiet confidence and shrouded
capability.  I would definitely rather cruise to work sedately in a 928 then
drive  balls out in a BMW. (nothing against BMW's either, I had one and I
loved it, but it ain't a 928.)  

This car is so good that even with the right pedal fully depressed and the
engine in full song, it doesn't feel particularly fast (even though several
layers of paint can be seen peeling off in the side mirrors..)  That kind of
bugs me, but then I see the Corvette in the rear view trying to keep up
(next to the 911) and I smile...Jeez, my 944S felt alot faster.  But, the
928 is more fulfulling to me, its quiet and comfy, and grippy, and sexy (my
girlfriend told me on the phone that she misses the Porsche, not me!)  Go
out.  Wash your car.  Check the oil. Vacuum it out.  Take a couple of pics
and send 'em to Phil.  Open the sunroof and cruise down the nearest trendy
street and Be Seen in a Porsche (yuck,  but you have to admit it is pretty
nice to be
>noticed...)  Fall in love again (sniff...)  Enough rapture about the car.
Go drive.

I think the lack of drama in the 928 will always keep a 911 in my
garage--alongside my 928. The amazing thing about the 928 is that the faster
you go, the smaller it gets. At speed, it's a very agile car.  And on a
given piece of road (the esses at the 13400 block of Mulholland Drive,
f'rinstance) I find I can exit about 7 mph faster with a 32-valve 928 than
with any 911 up to the 993.  On a challenging windy road like that, if you
become distracted or inattentive, or come across an unexpected obstacle at
8/10ths in a 911, and you'll be hard pressed to recover gracefully. The 928,
OTOH, is what they call a 'forvgiving' car: balanced, capable, and with
enough power and braking to handle whatever comes along and make you look good.

Rob, I suspect you'll regret selling the 928. Maybe not now, but soon... and
for the rest of your life--or until you buy another. I've always forund that
928s bring very little when you want to sell, but are a little pricey when
you go to buy... If you have a good one, hold on to it.

P.S. Another aspect of the 928 is that I find it draws far less attention
(both positive and negative) than a same-year 911, which makes me more
comfortable parking in marginal neighborhoods with the 928...

from mastery & control than abandonment.  Given the majority of my driving
circumstances, and the enormous capabilities of the 928, I seldom get the
opportunity to taste this most fulfilling pleasure.  The vast majority of my
wheel time is spent passively piloting the machine below or at the bottom of
its performance
envelope.

You both matched my beliefs pefectly.  I do not find much enjoyment driving
my machine on the regular highways/roads. Where in the UK, 2 lane windy
roads by default have a 60mph limit, here they are usally restricted to
35mph. I should say this is not necessarily wrong given the average driving
ability. What I was leading to is this is EXACTLY why I joined the PCA/SCCA.
To drive the car and discover its true limits is to really fall in love with
it. So much power, so much weight, yet the agility and manners unmatched by
anything else I have driven. I find Autocrossing the perfect outlet as even
pushing a car over the limit will rarely cause harm or damage. Anyway as
I've heard 356'ers say, it applies just as much to 928's now.... Keep the Faith!

Guys, I want to apologize for this long passionate post.  Robert, Robert,
Robert, I don't seem to have any of these problems with my 928S. I have seen
Camaro Z28s become airbourne at speeds of 110 mph (not enough weight). Heck,
if the 928 was any lighter you'd have to get a pilot's license to drive it.

One day I saw an accident between a 928 and a late model Ford, the 928 was
so solid that it cut the Ford into two pieces (928 driver walked away
unscathed).

I like the feel of the weight and solidness of my 928. When I get in and
close the door I feel secure when I here that familiar and solid  "thud", of
the door closing, I love to settle down in the cockpit and hear the thrust
of my 32v-V8 as I turn the key (Roars like a lion, speeds like a cheetah).

This weekend I was driving from Las Vegas to Los Angeles (Picking up my son
from UNLV), and I pulled in to get gas. There sat a Viper as he turn on the
ignition you could bearly hear his engine whine from the drowning noise of
my 32V. He gave me a frightening look, fearing it was a Devek 6.0 400 hp
(not yet). I smiled, filled my tank, turned the key and VVVVVVVROOOOM, the
empowering sound of my V8 jetted me along my way. I caught up with the Viper
a few miles down the road, he was surprised to see me. I mouthed to him over
the sound of my V-8, "one day we'll meet again" and I rolled off my exit.

Always when I arrive at a drive-thru (McDonalds) and the attendant has the
ask me to shut the car off so that they can hear my order. When I arrive
home from work the front door is already open (my wife can hear me coming
from down the block).

One day in traffic court a Burbank police officier admitted to the judge
that he recognized that I was speeding from the patented porsche 928 sound
(took him a while to catch me).

As a kid I lived near a Naval Base, and I love the sound of jets breaking
the sound barrier (sonic-boom), I don't travel that fast in my porsche but
it is nice to know that it can come close enough.

Robert I waited almost 15 year to buy my 928. I regret settling for
substitutes. I had Alpha's, Fiat's, 66 Mustangs, 66 Plymouth Barracuda, in
my quest for the ultimate car everything else came up short, until I saw and
heard the 928 (Tom Cruise-Risky Business). From that moment I lusted for it,
then that glorius day came and I was the proud owner of one. I had no Idea
that it packed a V-8 until I stepped on the gas and I felt the car pickup
and the gas pedal kick back wanting me to push it even more.

You would have to drag me away kicking and screaming before I would sell my
928. I realize there is nothing in the world like getting exactly what you
want (1986 928S Black on Black). It is my first Porsche and I find myself
lusting for another 928. To own another would be total Nirvana...)

Robert, I rest my case!

Leaving aside the issue of stick v. auto (yes, I know it was the subject of
your note, but this is my reply), you're absolutely right on with this.
Even leaving aside the issue of a driver's ability to master driving at 160+
mph (which, by the way, this car makes pretty much a piece of cake, at least
relatively; hmm, what's relative cake?), the car's too competent to scare or
thrill at speeds that most would dare to apply to the Amurrican road (100+
mph = felony in CA, for example), and those are the results that most people
appear to want from sports cars. 

Add that to an almost non-existent marketing effort from PCNA (to the point
where someone told me the other day that he'd always thought of 928s as cars
for "the doctor's wife", in the manner of M-B SLs) and you get the other
major component of car desirability, cachet with one's peer group and
family.  Oh, well, less expensive purchases for us.

(Rob Gold wrote) Such a thrilling machine, but so few thrills (apart from
being a bright red  cop magnet!).  I'm having serious second thoughts,
serious enough to  consider selling & moving on.  Is there a doctor on the
list?  Is my hour up  yet?  I think I need counseling.

What!!!   If you do that you to will 'mist' up whenever you hear/see 928
rumble by...  Instead how about:
        1.  Joining your local PCA - go racing!
        2.  Joining your local chapter of NASA - go racing!
        3.  Find the nearest dragstrip and TRY IT!   (car vs. car - driver
vs. driver!)
        4.  The Pony Express 100 is June 9th in Nevada!  Top speed thrills!
        5.  Find the nearest dyno shop & have fun tuning/testing

Yes you need our help!  PT

Rob, what is the perfect car then??  You could buy an old Rabbit and feel
like you are going 170 mph while only going 55... You could remove most of
the "extra weight" i.e., all the plush gadget in your 928 and turn it into a
racer.  It would be faster, lighter and noisier (if you remove the
soundproofing).  This might cure the 928 blues while still keeping its road
handling capabilities... Tell us what the perfect car should be...
