The "D" means model year 1983, for which production would have begun
sometime in summer of 1982 and continued into spring or later of 1983.

Call PCNA support at 800/545-8039 and ask them for help. They are the
quickest route to factory documentation.

Preferably bigger wire and fuse, but definitely a higher fuse rating.  
While running the lights and if the wires are warm, that would be a 
serious indication that you need thicker wires.  Running another wire 
in parallel to the existing one should increase the amperage load.

I use telekinesis to levitate my 928S about 18 inches off the ground 
first before placing the jack stands.  :-)
