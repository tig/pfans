I read that another owner was in the same situation as I as far as not being
able to get the lock knob plate loose. They were stuck working on the speakers
while the door panel was hanging by this plate.

DON'T ATTEMPT TO PRY THE PLATE OFF!

It unscrews! Yes, a revelation for me. After you pop the knob screw cover off
with a jewelers screwdriver, and after you unscrew the phillips head screw that
holds the knob on, the ~3 inch diameter, plastic back plate is threaded and it
unscrews from the door lock assy. You'll see a couple of notches, 180 degrees
across from each other, in the sides of the "doughnut hole". Evidently there
is some special tool which fits into these notches and allows one to unscrew
the plate. I simply used a pair of needle nose pliers, opened them up and set
the tips into the notches and then rotated the needle nose pliers.

Voila`
