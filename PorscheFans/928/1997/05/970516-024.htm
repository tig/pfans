Same thing happened to me several times (once in the middle of the desert ..
not fun).=20

I believe your problem is the master cylinder not resetting properly after=
 use.

I replaced my master cylinder and bled all the lines and presto!!!  no more
dragging brakes.

The cost of a new master cyliner from 928 International or Eurasian isn't
bad.  It's easy to replace, just don't whatever you do dislodge the flexible
line carrying brake fluid to your clutch master cyliner (if you have a
5-speed, that is).

I strongly suggest you fix before you drive ... not that it's very
dangerous, but you could warp your rotors if you allow them to heat up too=
 much.

By the way, as long as you're getting dirty, it might be a good idea to
rebuild all the brake cylinders and replace the pads if they're worn (and
"turn" the rotors if they're not absolutely true).  Involves taking the
piston out, replacing the seals, etc.  The rebuild parts are cheap and then
you're brakes will be good for years and years.

Good luck
