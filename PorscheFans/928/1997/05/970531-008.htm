There may be a remote oil filter kit for a different car which might be
adapted to the 928.  But I don't know any cross-application similiar to =
the
928 filter in width / thread / etc. for the adapter plate. Bet someone =
here
could fabricate one though hint hint. =20


The thread won't be the problem... the diameter might though.

(Sort-of) aside note:
Anyone saw their old filter in half to see what's in there?  I took a =
look
down the official Porsche filter and spied a relief spring in there!  So
I'm going to attribute it to a  bypass of some sort... another caveat
against buying cheaper, maybe not up to spec replacement parts you know?


I cut my filter at the last oil change...it was perfectly clean...I did =
notice the spring at the bottom but I didn't really pay that much =
attention.  A bypass valve would make a lot of sense though.  It would =
take a hell of a lot of material building up in that filter to cause it =
to bypass though.
