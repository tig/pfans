OK, but you'd notice a significant improvement in handling, stable max
acceleration, and maximum braking power by going to better tires, for less
than the cost of replacing your brakes.

>Think there's room to lower it?

Probably yes, but what do you have in mind to do it? Several aftermarket
spring sets, best taken with new shocks, come to mind, but the spring
perches can be adjusted for ride height (something best done by a very
competent shop, because proper adjustment of these requires weight
balancing; i.e., each wheel on its own scale)

Also, are you really ready to have your car be that close to the ground in
the real world (scrape, graunch, $$$)?

Terrific!

Have you actually observed this, or is it just that the brakes are fading
after sustained hard use? If something is "glazing", it's much more likely
to be the pads (for which there are all sorts of racy replacements) than
the rotors. Cross-drilling the rotors is supposed to vent the gases coming
off the pads during hard braking (the friction material vaporizes) to keep
the pads from lifting off the rotors.

>How difficult is it to reproportion the front/rear brake bias?

One straightforward way is to replace the stock proportioning valve with an
available Porsche part (as St=E9phane pointed out; John White is also
familiar with this trick, which originates with Kim Crumb of the PCA). I
can't find the number right now, but I'll dig it up.

A more gung-ho approach is to buy an adjustable proportioning valve from a
racing supply house (check ads in Panorama). You're on your own with
respect to installation, and some setting will produce highly dangerous
results, but you'll have control (or at least input)!

>What types of mods have you done to you 928?

quick digest:

- K&N air filter; small but noticeable improvement in response

- Amsoil Series 2000 20W50 racing oil; engine runs cooler and revs more=
 easily

- GTS-spec wheels ("technology" style from Wheel Enhancement; 7.5x17 f,
9x17 r with proper offsets) and tires (Michelin Pilot SX MXX3 N0, 225/45x17
f, 255/40x17 r), with all wheels realigned to suit; greatly improved stick
and response with minimal increase in ride harshness

- custom (done on a chassis dyno by Autosport Designs) reprogramming of the
fuel and ignition computers (about 50 bhp more, plus much snappier throttle
response, with no drop in mpg)
