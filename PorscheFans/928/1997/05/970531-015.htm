Its standard practice on aircraft to cut the can off old oil filters and 
inspect for metal flakes before letting the plane fly again. I often do it 
on my cars too. The bypass valve you mention is in every oil filter I've 
looked at in the past 20 years. You can usually see it by looking up the 
center. Don't have to cut it apart.

A while back I wondered about $2.00 Fram oil filters weighing about half 
what a genuine Nissan filter weighed so I cut one of each apart. Not sure 
about the relative filtering abilities of each but I liked what I saw in 
the Nissan filter enough to mail order them for $4 or so, or $5.50 locally, 
rather than use the Fram in my Nissan. One feature that not even Porsche 
filters feature is a new Nissan filter has its open end sealed in shrink 
wrap keeping cardboard dust and other things out of the filter until its 
used.
