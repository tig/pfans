        Hi Porsche fans, this is to Daron who has the warning light
problems.  If you read the owners manual carfully it does state that upon
start up that ALL OF THE WARNING lights on the console are to illuminate,
and to stay lit untill the engine is started except for the bake pad light
which will shut off when you applicate the brakes, at least that's what it
says for the 1980 manual.  So perhaps you have a connection getting better?!


        I have a question to all you Porsche fans out there with a service
manual.  The left hand side of my instament cluster is not opperational,
fault being that there is no supply power.  I've removed the cluster and
bench tested it, and found it to be okay.  So my question is, which fuse is
responsible for the gauge power, and if available where and what plug does
the gauge power wire run threw?  
        And yes like many other Porsches mine has one more problem,  
WHAT THE HECK controls the power switching to the brake lights, I could see
no switch on the pedal and my only thought is, that the brake lights are
switched by a brake fluid pressure switch that is connected to the brake
lines.  Obviously my brake lights are NFG!
        Just an aside, I knoted today while working on a post 1978 car that
in 1979 Porsche switched the side that the screws for the console "STUFF"
are held in by.  Meaning that to change or repair any thing under the
console, that you can't reach by means of removal of one of the side
pannels, you must remove the console, which means the entire dash face short
of the dash top must be removed!
You have to do this because every thing in the dash overlaps the console.
