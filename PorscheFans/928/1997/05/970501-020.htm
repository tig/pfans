It appears that my front struts are in need of replacement & was 
wondering if anyone could offer some suggestions as to what  a decent 
replacement model would be..and if it's really worth the effort to do 
the springs, too. I'm not after a lower ride, nor do I want my spine 
dislocated..its stiff enough right now.   
 
Also, one of my rear CV boots is cracked..is there a quickie-boot 
deal that will fit the 928? Im really not looking forward to removing 
the halfshaft.

Can anyone suggest a decent shop in the San Jose area that's open 
weekends? I know, not likely, but I had to ask..


Thanks,
Chris

Hi everyone,

Thanks to all who responded with ideas on how to get light to my
instrument panel.  I am happy to report that I do now enjoy this luxury.
 The rheostat was not the problem and as I did not see the posts on
steps 3 and 4 suggesting that I fiddle with the connectors on the back
of the panel  I proceeded directly to step 5, which is dismantling the
instrument pod and replacing the bulbs (which, by the way,  looked okay
but, I was not going to take the whole thing apart and then put it back
together again without doing something!).  It all worked perfectly well
when I got it back together.  I suspect that all I needed to do was
disconnect and then reconnect the loom. Anyway, it is all back together
again after a few minutes of despair when I couldn't believe what I had
done to my beautiful car.
Speaking of my beautiful car, Daron you had asked for a few specifics.
It is a 1979 model with a 5 speed.  The color is India Red.  It has been
resprayed in the original color.  (Our Colorado sun is known to wreak
havoc on any and all reds.)  The odometer shows 40k miles with a sticker
in the door jamb showing the original odometer was changed in late 1980
with 5k miles. It has a black leather  interior and is in outstanding
condition throughout.  I looked for better than a year to find the car I
wanted and am very pleased with what I got.
By the way, does anybody have any suggestions for getting the windshield
washers to work.  My headlight washer works but, the front and rear
windshield washers do not spray.  I have not investigated this problem
very far yet so any and all suggestions are sought.

Thanks,
Chris Trask
