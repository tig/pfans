Well 928 fans,

	I just finished installing my stereo system, 1 hour before my autocross 
event. I beat my last years' time by six seconds! Anyway, back to the stereo. 
It wasn't as easy as I thought. The factory uses those screw-on grilles, so 
keeping them was a challenge. I had to make an adaptor plate out of .090" 
aluminum, for the tweeters, and they are now angled toward the listener(s). 
The mids were actually the easiest to install. I used the supplied mounting 
bracket, and cut the four "ears" off, so I could use it as an adaptor. The 
speaker diameter was only .060" too small, and with the .030" thick bezel 
around it, the size was a perfect fit. The woofer could have gone in the easy 
way, but I decided to do it the "BETTER" way. Again, I had to modify the 
supplied mounting ring, and got it to fit like the factory speaker. ALL of the 
factory grilles were retained, and I did not cut 1mm of interior fabric, door 
panel, or sheetmetal! I put the passive crossovers where the factory amp was 
mounted. I dont know what ever happened to it, but it was missing when I got 
the car. I replaced one of my Soundstream amps with a Phoenix Gold, so now I 
have even more power and clarity. 

The MB Quart 3-way system sounds great! If you have never done an install, I 
would suggest not trying it in a 928 the first time out! I will try to put 
pics on Phil's 928 S4VR page, in case any of you are interested in upgrading. 
I can also try to answer any stereo ?'s you might have.

Jim 88 S4
