Recently St=E9phane Chabot asked if anyone else had experienced brake=
s that
dragged or acted by themselves.  Yes, this happened to me on my '86 9=
28S
automatic.  As I would drive, the front brakes would slowly apply the=
mselves.
Repeated flushing of the fluid did nothing to alleviate this.  Never =
would
this occur when I took the car to the shop.  It never occurred rapidl=
y,
but was an insideous thing.  I would just begin to feel a drag or, if=
 the
brakes heated, I sould feel a vibration.  Once there was so much drag=
 that
the transmission downshifted at about 70 mph while I was using cruise
control in order that it could maintain a constant speed!=20
Sorry to tell you St=E9phane, but the only thing that fixed the probl=
em on
my car was a new vacuum booster and was it expensive (ca. $400)!  Whe=
n I
looked into the job, I decided it was not something I wanted to do my=
self.
Since I replaced the booster two years ago, I have had no problems, e=
ither
on the road or on the track. (BTW, my car has the S4 brakes, but I do=
n't
think the vacuum boosters are different.)
