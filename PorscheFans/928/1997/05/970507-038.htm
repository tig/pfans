After getting my second speeding ticket in only three months of 928
ownership (about 1.5 months of which the car was in the shop), I decided I
needed a good radar detector. I don't speed excessively, but in a car as
funky looking as ours, we get singled out and pulled over in a group of
cars going the same speed.

So I bought a K40, their RD650VG-2 system (not the permanent installed
systems, $300 was more acceptable than the $900+ for those systems) and it
has worked like a charm so far. I intentionally went speeding by the state
police barracks hoping to find a trooper nearby checking speed. Sure
enough, at the onset of a bend on the highway, the K40 went nuts, and I
adjusted from 90 to a cool 50 mph. Waiting, waiting, no smokey, oh great I
thought, I spent $300 for something that gives false alarms, but about
25-35 seconds after it went off, I saw the State Police cruiser on the side
of the road. I smiled as I saw him notice my car as it went by (the sound
of the free-flow Borla at 4000 RPM must have something to do with this).

Technology, I love it!

(I was considering the Valentine one, because of its trick arrow radar
tracking feature, but the speeding ticket refund guarantee from K40 changed
my mind. Does anyone have a Valentine One, what is your experience with
it?)
