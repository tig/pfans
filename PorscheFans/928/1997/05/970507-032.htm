After reading all of your posts about your echorbitant stereo systems, I
am beginning to worry. Is the system that I have been carefully planning
out since I made the down payment on my car going to be 'loud enough'.
:)

My plan is this - I have a good understanding of electronic principles,
and have installed many of my own stereo systems, but do not have a
knowledge of sound staging geometries. (i usually tinker until it sounds
RIGHT)
Anyway - The car now has an Alpine 7905 Cd Player that has a busted CD
player.. so its basically a tuner. It also has about 8 speakers stuffed
all over the place under the upholstery - which I have yet to dig out
and discard. (I doubt I'll find anything worth keeping) The two things
in the car I am going to keep are the Alpine graphic equalizer (nicely
installed on the very bottom section of the console, its the width of a
standard head unit but about half the height) and the alpine 3542 AMP.
So here goes - I have done careful research on the best sounding
'Budget' speakers and electronics -

Head unit : Alpine DE 7985 3 disc detach face changer no AMP 4 RCA 2volt
preamp outputs.
Standard analog alpine graphic eq (unknown model number, but 91-92
vintage)
Alpine 3542 200 watt amp, mono-bridged. under the passenger seat
mated to the 3542 is a JL Audio 8.2 microsub (2x8" speakers in a
specially constructed small and lightweight enclosure - JL has gotten
very good ratings on this sub and they are not terribly expensive, I am
hearing mid $200 price range)
The lower door panels will house a pair of DEI 2065 separates - these
sets are $250 and have gotten nothing but rave reviews, their sound is
mindblowing, they consist of 2 6.5" mids (the largest I can fit in the
door according to a good-guys kiosk) two crossovers, and two external
mount dome tweeters.
The amp that will be driving those is a used Alpine 3500 series amp that
will be configured for 2 channel operation. He hasnt pulled the amp out
of his toyota supra yet for me to see the specific model number, but
judging by what its driving right now, it should be sufficient.

Anyway - the point of all this is, is it going to be big enough? Also -
after my last message i got a TON of replies in E-mail, I just wanted to
thank everyone that replied in case i missed anyone.
