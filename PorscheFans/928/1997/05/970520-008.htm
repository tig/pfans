|Have you guys ever thought about how this affects other motorists? Did you
|know that older peole need longer to readjust their eyes after being blinded?
|That glasses or contact lenses might cause reflections and increase the
|blinding to some? Have you ever noticed how much more you get blinded by cars
|running their foglights in the rain? It's probably even worse with those
|"power lights"...

I looked into this a while back. Personally I wouldn't upgrade the lamps
without changing to Euro spec lenses. The dispersion pattern is *MUCH* better
for oncoming traffic that the stock US lights. But I would *MUCH* rather SEE
than hope I am seen by someone else. Having someone drive at you with excessive
lights can be annoying, but if some drivers are severly handicapped by this
then I would suggest they have second thought about driving at night. In the US
there is a tendency towards everyone having absolute rights to drive despite
problems that would invalidate them in most other countries.

Personally I feel very UNSAFE with any stock US lights. If you drive only as
far as is visible [i.e. safely] you WILL be driving about 40MPH on the
interstates let alone smaller roads.

Driving at night I REALLY miss my UK 944, put main beam on [brights] and the
world lit up in front of you. Over here you might as well wave a flashlight out
the window!
[Sorry for the rant, another pet peeve].

As someone on Porschefiles used to put: This is my opinion and everyone is
welcome to it!
;-) ;-)
Keep the faith...
