After mucking around in the driver-side door in an unsuccessful
attempt to make the alarm work from that side, I found that the
power lock on that side had stopped working. Symptoms: from the
drivers side, the locks worked, but the sound of the motor
inside the door was absent; from the passenger side, if I tried
to lock the door, it would cycle right around and unlock itself.
It turns out that there are two 0.4 amp fuses, located on the top
back of the fuse panel, for the lock motors. They are held in
place by clips; you can feel them if you reach over the top of
the fuse panel. Tuck that information away in your cerebral
cortex (or wherever you store such stuff) in case one of your
door locks ever fails.

Incidentally, I managed to make the driver-side lock capable of
occasionally arming the alarm, but never disarming it. Kind of
annoying to have the alarm going off unexpectedly when the
door was opened; I said to hell with it and unplugged the 
connector on that side. Porsche only sells the lock alarm
switch as a unit with the lock cylinder, and it wasn't
worth that much to me. Maybe I'll change my mind when the 
passenger side fails.
