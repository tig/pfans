John, I'll go into more detail about the shim for the rear latch.  It's
worked perfectly for over a year.  I didn't get a chance to look at
yesterdays digest and tonight it already too late.  As soon as I hook up
the scanner... a picture is worth a thousand word!

I'm glad to hear that someone else misses the 928s at autocrosses.  My
first autocross was last sunday, and the NOC 928s are now in A Class,
not in B Class as it has been in the past.  Today I had a set of R1s
mounted to even the score (I hope).
