  I haven't seen any aftermarket rear bars advertised, so you're probably
  stuck with a stock bar.  Used should be ok if you can find one.
  
  I'm curious about how a tow could have bent the bar in the first place
  since it is above the transaxle.  Are you sure the drop links (@ $50) 
  aren't just broken or bent?  I've had one of those break on my car before.
  As a former tow truck driver (during my college years), this just
  reinforces my opinion that tow trucks are on their way out and flatbeds
  are the wave of the future!
  
  BTW, Weltmiester and Devek sell beefier front bars for the 928.
  
  P.S. You do have the tow hook that came in the toolkit, right?
