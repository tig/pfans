Not a clue on the paint, but the door lock knob is a piece of cake.

The knurled knob has a center panel made of soft plastic. It's held on with
three small prongs. Use a skinny-bladed screwdriver to pop it off and you
will reveal a nut and washer. Remove these and the knob pops off. Push on
the dished bezel with your palm and unscrew it.

>Greetings,

>I've recently become a 928 owner so I though I would join in on all this
>fun.  The car is a not so pristine '84 model.  It's got 140k miles on it but
>it still runs great. I've got several questions about the car but I'll limit
>it to a couple of easy ones for starters.
>
>First of all, I would like to find out what the original color of the car
>was.  It's obviously been repainted but I can't find any traces of the
>original paint.  I have the color code (9999VK) from the original sticker so
>maybe someone knows of a source for a cross reference.
>
>Next question.  I've got a problem with a window that sticks when rolling up
>so I thought I would take a look at it.  Removing the door panels was
>straight forward except for one problem - I could not get the door lock knob
>off to remove the last panel.  Is there a trick to this or do I simply pry
>till it pops.  I've got enough broken parts already, so I don't need another.

>Thanks for the help.
