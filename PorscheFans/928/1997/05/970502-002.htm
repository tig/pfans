You better satisfy your 928 urges or you'll end like me - buying a 911, not
being REALLY happy with it, selling it and ultimately getting not one but
two 928's!  (Well, one is for sale but that's another story)

This is a good starting point and I've seen some fairly decent '85 - '86 
32v cars asking this, with a manual trans even - which some say is one of
the most important options the 928 should have.  We're talking 288hp - is
that enough to make you forget about that six-cylinder?  One quick test
drive should do it :)   Take a look at www.classified2000.com , excellence
magazine, Hemmings, etc.

In my experience, the 928 is much more reliable and bulletproof but this
really depends on the use and upkeep the car enjoyed from it's past owners.
 Purchasing the 'right' car is tantamount to a rewarding ownership
experience no matter what car we're talking about.  

Ok check this out FWIW:  my '84 928 S w/ AT has 145k miles on the clock and
runs like new.  I took it to the dyno and did four full throttle runs
(afraid to blow it up? nah this is a Porsche 928!) and drove home no
problems.   I even went to Sears Point and did three drag races, besting
the 1/4 mile specs in the owner's manual!  The guys at the track (esp the
ZR1 owners) just could not believe it.   Drove home and continued to use
the car for regualr street duty, again no problem.  Now I might be more
attentive than the usual owner, having religiously changed oil after every
session or 1k miles but that underscores buying the 'right' car to begin
with and maintaining it properly.

Given real, first-hand proof of how solid and tight this particular car is,
there is no reason for a rebuild at 145k miles but a t-belt change would be
nice.  This is in opposition to the 911 engine (esp the 2.4 / 2.7's) that
would have exhibited major head stud pulling problems miles ago, valve
train maintenance, tensioner maintenance, synchro problems, etc.

Don't get me wrong, I do appreciate the 911 platform and someday would like
the 'right' car but first (or second or whatever) make mine 928 please...

1.  Project 928  - this is the bible of the 928's development.  You are not
going to believe the process this car took from inception to test mules to
modifications to more testing, etc. finally to unveiling.    These books
are highly collectible for the 928 enthusiast and at times very hard to
find new, driving prices up on the secondary market.  Try emailing
DEV928@aol.com for availability...

2.  Porsche 928 Performance Portfolio 1977 - 1994 by Brooklands Books. 
This has almost every magazine article and technical writing in one
paperback book. 

3.  Porsche 928 manual set - 9 volumes!  The ultimate reference of course
comes from Porsche.  Costly yes, but not really in comparison to the info
inside.  Also hard to locate new at times.

4.  There are numerous other tech spec booklets, you gotta' get yourself an
excellence magazine and read it cover to cover.

5.  Check our archives too :)

Hey that's S.O.S.  (sure you know that!).   Good luck on your search and
have FUN on all those test drives!  Let us know what happens too!
