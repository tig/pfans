It's not quite Dakota's surging North Fork flood, but Colonel Stapp, my
late''86 928S 5speed (99k) has sprung a leak!  Yep, it's 92 octane.  Small,
and not constant, dripping.  Not much dripping when the beast has stood
overnight or in the garage during work, but noticable (to others, who keep
beeping to tell me!) when going, and perhaps a bit more when cornering.  The
source appears to be the right (passenger side) rear bottom of the tank, but
I'm by no means certain of this.  Obviously, this is one fix that can't be
put off until later!

HELP!  In my purchase research I learned that this sometimes happens around
or after 100k, and that the 928's tank is made from some kind of formed
plastic material.  Assuming that the mechanics don't find some other problem
(leaking or clogged/overflowing fueld filter, stuck-open breather, a leak in
the filler pipe, etc.), what are my options?

Is a new tank mandatory, or is there such a thing as a reliable used tank
from one of the dismantlers (Kempton, 928 International... other
suggestions?).  What does PCNA in Reno want for a tank?  What is a
reasonable price for a used tank.  Assuming a straight swap, how long should
it take for an experienced Porsche & 928 mechanic to replace?

THANKS FOR THE HELP!
