In response to my woes on an intermittant cruise control, John C. C. White
suggested that I clean the switch on the clutch pedal which serves to
disengage the cruise control when the pedal is pressed. 

John, I took it out, cleaned it up, measured the resistance to make sure it
works, and put it back.  Didn't help.

But....  while I was down there, I pressed the brake pedal with my hand and
heard a "hiss".  Pressed again and the pedal was stiff - no vacuum left.
So, I have a bit of a vac leak when the brake is pressed.  This takes
priority in my budget, so the cruise control fixin' may take 2nd place for
awhile.  

Jim at 928 International offered to let me come down to the shop and measure
the resistance across some vacuum servos to see if they change from 14 ohm
to infinity when the meter is put on them (don't understand why it would
change, but that's what the factory manual says).

Thanks for the suggestion ... I was really hopeful that you'd pinpointed it.

Oh, well.
