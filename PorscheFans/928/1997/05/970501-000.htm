Hey NorCal 928'rs and 'team microbrew':

How about some SHOW to balance all that GO  :)  

Anyone up for the Wash 'n Shine Sunday May 25th in Danville, CA?  

"Remember, this is a 'wash and shine' concours.  We will not check the
engine compartments, trunks, wheel wells or the underside..."   "Every
entrant will receive a ribbon and many will drive away with an award..."   
Basically clean your car as usual and ta-da it's a show car!

An alternate event is the Zone Concours & Swap Meet Sunday June 8 at
Automotion in Sunnyvale.  The judging is alot more serious here.  The one
year I went (in the old SC) there were only two 928's there - Madison's '85
and another.  (MG, if you're lurking out there, please reply!)

We don't have to enter either event - could just corral our own section of
parking lot or sidewalk, cruise around the happening on foot, maybe find
some good deals/sales/bbq?, etc.  

I don't even have a car at this point ('84 on display, '90 pending arrival
still) but remaining hopeful that I can join you all to have some 928 fun
without danger of track damage.  

Whaddaya say?
PT
