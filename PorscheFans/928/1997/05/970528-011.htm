Whoa - you're quoting me out of context here.  It's great for the track
- but going too low in NYC will look neat and produce lotsa sparks.

I'm sure there is - the 17's are wider but the same height.  Take those
nice wheels off and look at the shocks.  The bottom spring perches have
adjustable collars on them.  Turn the nut and that corner goes up or
down - do both sides the same and it's nice to corner balance when
you're done.  On mine, it would've been very difficult without taking
off the spring due to the amount of crud on them.  Spray liberally with
WD-40, blow it off with compressed air, and then put on some
anti-seize.  You might want to try to get some tension off the coil
spring but this is a bit tricky without removing the springs (I know a
few ways - if one's easy AND works, I'll try to let you know.)

Shouln't affect ride quality (bumps) at all unless you scrape.

Best,

(Remember you'll have to adjust front toe (more toe in) and you'll have
more negative camber.)
