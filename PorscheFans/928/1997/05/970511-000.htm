Hi Gang!

Just thought I'd add penny's worth to the debate about model numbers. It is
my understanding that the designations are as follows, though please bear
in mind that these are from a european perspective and may not coincide
with the USA.

The original '77 Model was known as the "928"
In '80 Porsche released a "Sportier" uprated version with amongst other
things 300bhp instead of 240 (Euro. Spec.) This was designated the "S"...
and I am in the camp that labels them the car a "928S", if you want to know
why then take a look at the front of the owner's manual.

In 1984 came the next model update in Europe. This consisted largely
(Though not exclusively) of the following: ABS brakes, 8" rear wheels,
uprated suspension and a four-speed auto. transmission option in place of
the three. This was called the 928 S2 (Please note the gap, I think the S
is for "Series" and not "Sport" as in the original "S".

In 1986 the 928 S4 was released with American and Eurpean outputs matched
finally... you all know what an S4 is!

....but where is the S3 model I hear you clamour? This I can only guess at
but I believe that unofficially the S3 was the earlier 32V US spec. "S"
model, known to you guys on occasion as the S2 perhaps?

Anyway, just thought I'd add my thoughts to the equation.

Adam? Are you out there? How about running this query past Kim Crumb when
you next hear from him? And by the way, I've seen your car on your
web-site! That is a killer shot of you using it "In anger" so to speak!
Awesome... totally awesome. Perhaps you should let Phil Tong use that shot
on his web-site?

Right, I've used up enough of our electron-space on this!

Best regards,
Daron Townson
1981 928S (As proscribed by the owner's manual!)

...Go V8 or go home!!)
