I've seen posts regarding the difficulty of jacking up the 928 and thought
I'd share my solution with you all. Though I have a floor jack, I only have a
one car garage and space is limited. (I can only justify one 928 as I'd hate
to let the other one sit outside: Sad isn't it?) Anyway, what I did was go to
the local junkyard and pick up four spare tire jacks. They came from
different cars, but all are shaped like a hydraulic floor jack. Kinda (is
that a word?) like a bumper jack laid down. They were cheap (only 5 $ each)
and are very strong and stable. MUCH more stable than scissor jacks. I also
use my jackstands near the lift pads for safety. If jacking all four corners,
jack car evenly and slowly. Use your best judgement and PLEASE don't get hurt
or hurt your car on my account. (That's the disclaimer part :) 
Now I have some questions:)
Is there supposed to be a belly pan under the engine? I have one that begins
near the back of the engine and there are holes on that pan and also on the
front air dam. Is there supposed to be a pan that connects the two? If so,
price used?
Also, is there suppossed to be a plastic inner fender well piece on the
passenger side quarter panel? (There is one on the drivers side)
Help, my car is missing pieces!!!!!
Thanks to Vince and John for headlight advice.
Oh, BTW, do any of you all live near Lexington, Ky.?
