Caused a flashback to the day I brought home this shiny gold 928, my boss's
car, to show to a freind/prospective buyer. My wife said "We should drive
that up the canyon and back, it's such a nice evening." I agreed, put her in
the pilots seat, and we were off.  One rush through 4 gears, shifted @ ~5k,
my wife turned to me and said "Oooh, that's FUN!"
Never did get a chance to show it to my freind.....

(and I was envisioning a battle to get this car! Just DRIVE it!)

Ramble, ramble, ramble.......(sorry)
