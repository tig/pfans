My car also reads around a little over 2 bar at idle and 5 above
3000 RPM or so.  This is for 10-30 Mobil 1.  I've been told by my
mechanic this is OK.

If I use the 15-50 Mobil 1 or Redline it is slightly higher than this.
I generally use this stuff in the summer months and the 10-30
for the other two oil changes (Spring/Fall).

Also, for oil IN the intake, I've been told that SOME amount (I found 
a teaspoon or so) of this is normal and not to worry.  If you're asking 
is it normal in the V under the intake, it would just cause the car to be 
a little hotter because of the added dirt and grime and I would clean 
it out.  If it's in there, it's probably from your leak or maybe a 
misplaced hose in the oil breather system which is connected to that 
T shaped filler neck.
