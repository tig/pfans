Air Filter Cover 86 928S  (Document link not converted)

Hi guys, I finally discovered how to post on this group. I have a question
and maybe someone can help me. I am looking for the plastic air filter
housing (cover) for my 1886 928S. I called the dealer and it cost $400.00
($200 for the top and $200 for the bottom) for two pieces of plastics .
Does anyone know of a third party mfg who produces these cheaper. I've
called 928 International and they do not carry them. On the filtercover
there is a Purolator emblem (Does Purolator mfg these, if so where can I
find them). I also went to the dealer to price an "Stick Shift"
(automatic) handle, $390.00, 928 International has them for $200.00. When I
purchased my 928S I thought the mechanical parts where going to be a
killer. Ends up that these plastic pieces cost a bundle. Not really
complaining about price (comes with the territory). Just trying to find
some deals so that I can save for that 6.0 Liter 400+ hp (Devek)
