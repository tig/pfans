"Colonel Stapp" -- my late '86 5speed, 99k miles -- is due for a variety of
fixes over the summer, as cash & time allow.  Feedback solicited!

1) AC:   If Chicago's wind is named "The Hawk" then perhaps Tucson's sun
could be called "The Hammer"!  I need a recharge & maybe (hope not!) other
stuff.  I've got the rear AC, too.  Anything particular to watch out for?
What's this going to cost (assuming just a recharge)?  Is this a job for my
excellent mechanics (Dan Oebker & Walt Harrington of Franklin Services) or
for an AC specialist?

2) DASH RATTLE:   I have one solitary bonking sound behind the HVAC controls
on dash.  It sounds like the loose end of a long-ish plastic rod flopping loose.

3) SPEEDO:   Generally doesn't "wake up" until about 15-20mph, them jumps up
to speed.  Intermittent, more often during warm up than not.  Is this a
warning of some impending failure?

4) DASH LIGHT:   The light behind the temp guage is intermittent (usually
not working).  Is this the monster "take off the who instrument pod" job?
(if so, I'll squint!).

5) WINDSHIELD  & WASHERS:   All systems down!  Also, glass very pitted by
grit, etc.  Any solution short of windshield replacement?

6) BRAKES:   Time for new rotors & pads (late-86's have anti-lock w/4-piston
brembo calipers... pre-S4 equal-size pistons prone to causing uneven
pad/rotor wear, rumor says).  As much as I want Monster Brakes, I HATE the
scraping- squealing-clunking I've heard on most 928's I driving &/or seen.
Recommendations, please, for best way to go & sources for reasonably-priced
parts!

7) PAINT:   Some malfeasant "keyed" my whole right side.  While I've got the
car in for painting (India Red), what can be done to deal with the faded
front & rear painted bumpers?  Will sanding for paint prep remove the
galvanized coating on the steel?

8) GAS PRICES:   AZ has some of the highest prices in the USA: 92 octane
going for $1.50/gal +/- $0.05.  John White wrote:

Other than breathing 93 octane fumes the entire time,  the operation was a
breeze.  (Oddly enough, I felt quite happy afterwards - not sure why...)  Ed

Hey Ed, you might as well have been breathing 87 or 89 octane fumes, that's
all your car actually needs. Unless it's a Euro, in which case, never mind...

I haven't tried 87 or 89 octane in my 32v.  Worth a try, or believe the
owner's manual?

Thanks, gang!
