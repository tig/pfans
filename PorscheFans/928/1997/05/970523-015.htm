I've been driving 928s since they first came out. Currently on my sixth one
which is an 87 S4 five speed.  In the seven years I have owned it I have
replace the front air dam four or five times.  With one exception, they were
all broken by restaurant parking lot attendants who drove them too far into
parking places and smashed the air dams either on the way in, or when
backing out.  They now cost app. $500.00 plus labor to replace.  Has anyone
come up with a remedy for this aside from not allowing others to drive your
87 or later 928s?  would appreciate and input, as I am currently waiting for
a new air dam to arrive for installation.
