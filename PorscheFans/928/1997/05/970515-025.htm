Various people wrote these things:

> Does anyone know if the factory manuals are produced on CD-ROM?

Something I read in the latest Excellence hinted at that happening
soon, but I don't know if they're available yet.  For now, just fiche
and dead trees.

> I wonder if anyone has ever used a 928 power plant in another car?

Again, latest Excellence, article on Porsche's entry in P-D rally
84-86, the Porsche team had a 928 motor in some kind of MB ORV they
were using as a chase vehicle...  That was just a minor detail in
the article, but it was a good read even without mention of the 928
^_^

Now a couple questions of my own:

Why are so many 928's painted boring colors?

Red - boring (and cop fodder... or is that just urban myth?)
      My Festiva is red; what a sporty car.
White - boring
Black - boring
Silver - marginal
Brown/tan - Volvo colors!  'nuff said...

What's wrong with blue, green, purple, etc.?  And I'm not talking
about the muted, almost-black shades you see so much...  I want to
see something light, maybe metallic.  Or how about pastels?

Am I the only person on this list who actually thinks the colors
on that last 928 are great?

An exciting car should look exciting!

Also, how many people out there are in the 'leather interiors suck'
camp?  Hot in the sun, cold in the winter, have to be babied...
