Ok,
I was musing while driving into work today...
The night before, I read an old road test (2 actually, Road and Track
and Automobile) that stated that the 928 GTS was one of the fastest
production cars in the world, and then proceded to list half a dozen
cars that were faster, including the ZR1.  We all know that being that
fastest doesn't really count over here( since we don't have the roads on
which to prove it), but bear with me a moment:

Should Porsche have gone all out with the 928 earlier (such as a STOCK
6l motor, some kind of turbo, etc...)?  Was it that you could get a ZR1
for less money with "better" (I didn't say it...) performance?  If you
could afford a GTS at almost 100k, then could you also maybe be in the
market for something more Italian etc...?  If porsche had made THE
FASTEST, BADDEST, STICKIEST, etc car in the world (numerically), would
it still be available today?

Mind you, I am NOT grousing about the performance of the 928 in ANY
way.  I love my car, and I covet some of yours (i'm not tellin'.)  In my
mind they're about as perfect as they can be.  I am just bemoaning the
premature expiration of what should be a timeless design.

The 911 TT is just the epitome of a no compromise sports car.  It costs
alot of money, it is the best in every numerical category, AND it has
that certain je ne sais pas that all Porsches have.  I don't know how
many people buy them, but I'd imagine that its more than the last few
years of the 928...

Any thoughts?

Jus' wunderin'
