No 30-day money back guarantee?  That's not good for the customer at all. 
Like buying software at Egghead - open the box and you're dead, what a joke

If you still have time, continue to do your A/B testing for awhile but keep
in mind that no chip swap is going to make any car a fire-breathing
acceleration monster.  Especially our 928's since they are so highly strung
from Stuttgart already, know what I mean?
