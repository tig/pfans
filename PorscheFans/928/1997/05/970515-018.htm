Tim, having had a 85 1/2 and presently a 90', your observations regarding
mechanical parts vs. trim/interior/plastic parts is true.Porsche is very
"proud" of their non-merchanical parts, and prices them so. But NOT TO BE!.
There are dozens of 928 dismantlers that I utilized on my 85 1/2 928 for
interior/underhood non-mechanical parts at minimal prices. These are
independent yards, not big houses like 928 International (apples vs.
oranges). But I like the "mom and pop" yards prices. As far as mechanical
pieces go, PCNA & their dealers have set up VERY aggressive pricing on
mechanical parts to keep our cars running less expensively. And remember, any
part replaced at a dealer comes with 2 year parts AND labor warranthy at any
Porsche dealer. If you would, or any member, would like to know a few
addresses and phone #'s for 928 "dismantlers/yards" for your XYZ
trim/underhod parts, just drop me a E

A 6-pound sledge hammer should do the job. :-)  eh.. John, you have to 
remove the door panel to access an electrical connector that goes to 
the door lock.  If you've never removed a door panel before, let me 
know.
