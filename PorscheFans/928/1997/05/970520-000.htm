The outside temp sensor, the inside temp sensor, and the temp
control rheostat are wired in series. The overall resistance
of the circuit varies from about 2700 to 3700 ohms depending on
the position of the rheostat (at room temperature, around 20 C).
So a ballpark estimate of the outside sensor resistance would
be 1000 - 1500 ohms. It can't be all that expensive to buy a
replacement, though, can it? Even in Oz?
