Hello Frank,

Afraid I can't actually add anything to this at the moment but I am in the
same position as you, namely my driver's door uses one key, my ignition
another, yet another for the tailgateand no keys at all for the passenger
door! I had thought that my only course of action would be a completely new
lock set so I contacted 928 International where I was told a price of 650
bucks!! I had heard rumours to the effect that the lock barrels might be
filed to suit new keys but took this with a pinch of salt, but now the
subject has arisen again maybe it is indeed true so if you or anyone else
have any suggestions on this I'd love to be copied in on it.

As to removeing the lock barrels themselves? For the doors this is a piece
of cake, there is an allen-headed bolt level with the lock barrel itself on
the rear of the door; undo this bolt and slide out the barrel, unclippimg
the plastic arm to the mechanism itself. That's the good news, the bad is
that to get it back together is a real *@=A3$! of a job since you have littl=
e
or no room to access the plastic clip. As for the ignition key and tailgate
locks I'm afraid I don't know, having never attacked that particular area
though no doubt there are messages winging their way to you from others who
have!

Anyway,best of luck and please do let me know if you are successful in
this, I'm  just dying to save 650 dollars!
