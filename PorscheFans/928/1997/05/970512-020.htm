Hello Phil (and the rest of the list...)

I have not deciphered the VIN.  I am not sure, exactly how to do this,
but here it is in case anybody get ambitious:

WPOJBO92OKS860300

The options on the ORIGINAL STICKER (I love looking at the original sale
price...and showing to my friends...) are :
1.  Steering wheel with raised hub
2.  Limited Slip

There are bunches of other "no cost " options like full leather, body
molding, auto trans, etc...

I do not have the luggage cover.  Are they rare for some reason?  I
don't think it would fit over the Rockford Audiophile sub box in the
hatch (the PO installed a pretty good system in it and left it in for me
to enjoy...Eclipse head, aforementioned sub box, 10 MB Quarts of various
sizes, and a Denon amp.  I'm am thinking about putting the soundstream
amp I had in my 944S in place of the Denon, but I haven't decided...)

This morning when I filled up and did the math I was shocked to see that
(after checking my math) I had averaged 20.2 MPG!!!!  That's not at all
bad especially after a few 120MPH passing runs...
