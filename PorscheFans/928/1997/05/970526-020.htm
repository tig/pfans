I wonder if anyone can answer a question about my 85 928S 32 valve. It 
looks like the computer lives in the passenger foot well and there is a 
single brown wire with a white in line connector that is kind of separate 
from the main harness. When I first peeked in there I noticed that 
someone had pulled the connector apart separating the two halves of the 
wire. This was obviously deliberate as each half of the connector had 
been wound up in insulating tape. I sort of took a chance and assumed the 
wires belonged together and reconnected them. Doing so has not had any 
immediately noticeable effect. This raises a few questions of course. 
What is the wire for, why would someone disconnect it and if the wires 
belong together why did Porsche separate it and put a connector in line 
instead of including it in the harness?

Can't say I'm losing  much sleep over this but if anyone out here has any 
clues I would much appreciate hearing from you.

Colin
