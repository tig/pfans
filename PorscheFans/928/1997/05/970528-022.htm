Adam,

As you described, I also had to bend that arm back into proper position
to get the kickdown button to activate the relay.  I'm quite certain
that it works, as at highway speed I can push the pedal to the point
where it almost hits the button and the tranny will downshift only once,
but if I push a little more to click the the button, it will drop
another gear (rpms permitting).

I hate to sent it to a shop in hopes that they can get it to downshift
to first at 50 mph.  I can see them charging hundreds and having no
positive results.  

It seems almost as if the kickdown relay doesn't work from second gear
to first, but is okay in third and fourth.  Maybe I can hotwire it with
a momentary switch to test if it is working?  Any advice out there?
