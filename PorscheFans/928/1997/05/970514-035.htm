Such true words I really regret selling mine. No vehicle has given me the
same 'feeling' since and all I think about is my next one (with this list
keeping up the passion nicely). 

I'm pretty sure the 928 was what won my wife's heart for me and I know she
wants me in another so she can again see the 'man she married' as opposed to
the broken down shell she lives with today.

Don't sell the beast, go out and give it a big hug. :-)

I can understand a parrot mistaking a wall mirror for a whole other room but
you'd think he'd at least try to avoid the head-on collision with the other
bird...
