RE: toothed belt tension warning

This one works.  When I had the timing belt done, it came on 
800 miles or so afterwards, which is right around the time
my mechanic said to retension it (which he did gratis, since he
had already done the belt - nice guy ;).  If it comes on, probably
tow it or drive VERY gingerly to get it serviced.

RE: coolant sensors

There are more than one - the main one is in the bottom of the
radiator.  I had a bad one and replaced it with a 1K Ohm resistor
(it's basically a thermistor) when my fan wouldn't come on until I
could get another one.  Tip for replacing the sensor: the $14 connector
puller really helps when removing the connector to the sensor - my
fingers are too big to get in there.

But there are also sensors on the head (two) and one on the intake
for temperature as well.  If you have an automatic there's one on
the transmission also.

RE: pressure sensor on AC

Yes there is one and it works.  I lost some freon in my car and it
prevented the compressor from turning on (fixed at my local repair
shop for several hours labor, some seals and a new heater control).
There is also a relay which protects the compressor (ie shuts it off)
at high RPM.
