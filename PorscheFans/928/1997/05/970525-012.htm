I never entertained the idea that the system used some type of liquid. 
I'll take a closer look at my system.  I have the factory manuels and it
doesn't mention the adjustable lights once.

It does seem odd if the only purpose of the adjustable lights was to
compensate for heavy loads, but I thought I read somewhere that they
were adjustable up and down for city and high speed highway driving.  At
speeds over 100 mph, you would "outdrive" your highbeam headlights if
they were corrected adjusted at lowbeam as so not to blind oncoming
drivers in the city.

My curiosity is peaked just because I like all the little do-dads that
came with these cars.  Thanks for the info.

Mark
