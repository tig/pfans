i can tell you positively that the windshield does not have to come
out. i removed tested and replaced my heater core a couple of
years ago (i thought it was leaking, but it wasn't, turned out to
be a loose hose clamp and an ingenious trickle of coolant: fixed by
tightening a hose clamp. total job time 15 hours :-( ). there's
a lot of stuff to remove and replace, but its pretty straightforward.

The first thing I would check is the fuel filter and pump.  You need to 
remove a cover panel to do this.  And its located just about where you 
say it is leaking.

I guess I'm fantasizing along the line that there will be a DEDICATED 
928 Magazine; equivalent to Excellence.... Oh, well.... it doesn't cost 
anything to daydream!
