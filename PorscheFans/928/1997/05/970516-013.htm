I had already done the continuity check, so I knew the switch was bad.
Managed to get the lock the rest of the way out with just a little
more persuasion plus removing the mechanism for the rotary knob
so I could see what was going on better. Took the switch off the
back of the lock, and it's really ugly in there: badly corroded
contacts and lots of crud, plus I can't see how the ground
contact is supposed to be made to the moving part. Maybe there's
a spring missing or something. Finally gave up for now, put
things back together somewhat, and now the little motor for the
locking mechanism doesn't work. So it's zero steps forward
and one step back. Or "no good deed goes unpunished." 

Just took a look at the wiring diagram, it shows separate 4A fuses
_behind_ the fuse/relay panel, one for each lock motor. Maybe
I'll be lucky and that's the only damage, will check tonight.
