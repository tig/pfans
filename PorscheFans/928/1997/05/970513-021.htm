Yes Purple!

I live a few blocks down the street from the purple 928.
The owners is a lady and I guess purple is her favorite color.
The interior is Black. The purple is a custom paint job.

Check your fuel pressure.  I had a similar problem when I first got my 
928S and found that the PO hasn't change the fuel filter for about 4 
years.  (the manufacture date was printed on the filter...)
