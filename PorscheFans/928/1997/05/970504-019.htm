I suggest doing the RH door and hatch to match the LH door and ignition.
The ignition could well be ugly to get out, but the doors and the hatch are
a piece of cake. The door lock comes out with the removal of a single hex
bolt on the door 'edge'. The hatch one comes out by removing two hex bolts.
To remove the lock barrel on the hatch cylinder, all that is required is to
press out a single spring pin.

Removing the lock barrel on the door cylinder may be easy...or difficult,
depending on the type. Let me explain. My car is a 78. Somewhere along the
way, the PO had a fairly serious fender-bender, which caused substantial
damage to the passenger door. I know this because I striiped the interior
out of the car over the winter and found evidence (updated window and
mirror motors, lots of heat and hammer marks inside the door, Scotch-taped
wire connections!). When I removed the locks from both doors, I found the
drivers door lock (presumably the original) was easily dismantled by
removing a circlip on the back end of the cylinder. The passengers door
lock was not the same and I could find no way of dismantling it. I also
noticed that, unlike most Porsche L/R pieces, the serial number on the
passenger lock did not differ from the drivers lock only by the last digit
(01 or 02). Either the lock was superceeded by a new version or the 'new'
lock came out of a later model car. They look identical from the 'outside'.

Re-keying should be a simple matter for your locksmith, assuming your door
locks are dismantle-able. Incidentally, taking apart the locks is not for
the faint of heart. I'm a pretty good network engineer but as a
locksmith...well, I'm a pretty good network engineer. Seriously, it not too
bad if you work on a clean cloth and lay things out methodically. Once
everything is cleaned and re-assembled, blow a little dry graphite into the
lock and it will work amazingly smooth.
