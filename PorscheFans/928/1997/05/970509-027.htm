Sorry, my mail wasn't working quite correctly, so if I missed a reply to the
follow post, please send it again.  Thank you.

        I must buy a car jack for the 928, having discovered after 15 months
that there isn't one. would greatly appreciate an email if someone has a
cheap "leftover" around. Thanks...

Sean, maybe you should hook up with Barry (aBCD Printing Co.) and see 
if you guys can work something out.  I still think a dedicated 928 
Newsletter would be a great boost to the 928's image!  And I personally 
don't mind paying a "subscription fee" to receive it.
