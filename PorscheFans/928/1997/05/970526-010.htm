The thing to the right of the clock is not an instrument - its just a
large seat belt warning light (big lens with a bulb behind).

If you track down the uphostery, I would be interested in your findings.
have you tried http://www.autosintl.com/ ?  (I've never phoned them to
inquire about material) Is your car a US or Euro version?
