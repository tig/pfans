 Re: Leonard Laub's comments on MPG:  As a point of reference, I recall
using the cruise control on my 87S4 five speed just once in the seven years
I've had it. Set it at 78 MPH and drove nonstop on a single tank full of gas
from Palm Beach FL to Charleston SC in seven hours. Took 21.7 gallons there
and averaged 23.8 MPG 
which is just five MPG better than I average in normal driving.

>>     I have a 79 928 Automatic.  Two problems:
>>     
>>     1) Front upper A-arms seem impossible to unbolt to change shocks.  I 
>>     gave up after unbolting everything except them to put new schocks and 
>>     lower springs on the car.  I finally bolted everything back together.
>>     
>>     
>>     
>>     2) Ring gear on flywheel is chewed up so I got a later model flywheel 
>>     from 928 international which has an integrated ring gear that is 
>>     harder.  
>>     
>>     After removing bell housing cover plate and losing coupler and

>>     is blocking the path to drop the spring plate and ring gear out the 
>>     way, so the flywheel bolts are accessable.
