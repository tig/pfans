Hello,

DO NOT SELL YOUR PORSCHE!!!!
I understand the lack of playtime in our beautiful cars.  I drive
exactly 2.3 miles to work every day.  The oil pressure barely even drops
from 5 by the time I get there.  But this is why I have just sent in my
check to the PCA.  They'll have to make a new class for me (I couldn't
see the number 928 anywhere in the auto-x rules on the web page.) but
dammit I spent a lot of money and I will enjoy the car if it kills me.  

Besides, there is no shame in quiet confidence and shrouded capability.
I would definitely rather cruise to work sedately in a 928 then drive
balls out in a BMW. (nothing against BMW's either, I had one and I loved
it, but it ain't a 928.)  

This car is so good that even with the right pedal fully depressed and
the engine in full song, it doesn't feel particularly fast (even though
several layers of paint can be seen peeling off in the side mirrors..) 
That kind of bugs me, but then I see the Corvette in the rear view
trying to keep up (next to the 911) and I smile...Jeez, my 944S felt
alot faster.  But, the 928 is more fulfulling to me, its quiet and
comfy, and grippy, and sexy (my girlfriend told me on the phone that she
misses the Porsche, not me!)  Go out.  Wash your car.  Check the oil. 
Vacuum it out.  Take a couple of pics and send 'em to Phil.  Open the
sunroof and cruise down the nearest trendy street and Be Seen in a
Porsche (yuck,  but you have to admit it is pretty nice to be
noticed...)  Fall in love again (sniff...)

Enough rapture about the car.  Go drive.

Derron
'89 928 S4
