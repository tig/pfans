Well, I have my 4 calipers apart at this point and awaiting the
rebuilt kit to arrive (hopefully tomorrow).  While taking
the calipers apart, only 1 had a piston that was mobile enough
to be removed by hand.  The other three required to be blown
out (with air, not TNT ;-)

I observed what appeared to be GREASE inside the piston chamber
in the front two calipers.  Needless to say, I havn't got a clue
why the PO greased the pistons but a good cleaning will be done
prior to reassembly.

My next step is to remove the brake hoses and see if they are still
OK.  A mechanic friend of mine told me to just blow air through
the hose in both direction.  If the hose is collapse, the flow
will be restricted in one direction.  Anyone have other ideas on
how to check the hoses??

Now that my system is totaly apart, I am wondering if I should take
the master cylinder out of the car and check its condition.  Has anyone
who has removed the master cylinder give me some pointers??

TIA,
