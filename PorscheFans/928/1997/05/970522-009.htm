Yes, ENGINE temperature (see below). This occurs because the extra gasoline
vaporizes when it enters the combustion chamber, drawing away heat in the
same way that quenching a hot piece of metal with water will cool it an
produce a lot of steam. The latent heat of vaporization of most liquids is
pretty high, so this is a powerful method of cooling as long as you can
dispose of all the resulting vapor.

Yours, not mine.

So don't be so quick to answer a different, and quite serious question.

Remember all the gasoline vapor we just discussed? The cat is there to
oxidize unburned hydrocarbons leaving the engine, particularly unburned
gasoline, which is a potent source of photochemical smog, which in turn is
the reason why more and more gas pumps are equipped to draw the gas vapors
back in rather than venting them to air, and why all recent cars have some
sort of activated charcoal trap for vapors coming up from the gas tank.

The catalytically-promoted oxidation which takes place on the surface of
the catalyst within the converter is not strictly burning, in that there's
no flame, but it's the same chemical reaction and produces the same quite
large amount of heat per unit gasoline, which in turn is the large dose of
heat your engine counts on being liberated upon ignition in order to push
those pesky pistons down.

The normal amount of unburned gasoline reaching the cat is quite small, and
it still runs hot (e.g., some cars will set grass on fire if parked
thereon). A much larger flow of unburned gasoline, as resulting from a very
rich mixture, will proportionately increase the volume of the oxidation
reaction, and hence the heat produced.

This can certainly get the converter hot enough to glow red, and the excess
heat thrown off into the general engine area by such a hot converter can
easily cause cooling problems by raising the ambient temperature around the
engine (just like a very hot day).

This situation calls for urgent action. The cat will be destroyed by
sustained temperatures this high, and it might melt, distort, or set on
fire anything located near it.
