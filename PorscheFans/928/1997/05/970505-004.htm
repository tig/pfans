Mark,

  I've been dealing with a no start problem on my '83 quite a bit lately, so
  I've been reading the book "How To Tune and Modify Bosch Fuel Injection" to
  try and figure things out.  Unfortunately, 1) I don't have the book with me
  at work, so I can't tell you the author until tomorrow (but the cover has a
  photo of a red VW Golf on the cover - available at most book stores) 2) I don't
  know what model FI the '85 has (LH-Jetronic?).  Anyway, I do recall reading in
  the L-Jetronic section that a bad fuel filter would cause the type of problem
  you're having and the book goes into detail on why.  The book also recommends
  specific tests to perform on the old filter once it has been removed (and is
  still filled with fuel), so if you haven't changed to the new filter yet, you
  may want to wait until you can look at the test procedures.
