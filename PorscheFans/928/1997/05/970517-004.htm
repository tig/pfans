  I bought a DEVEK radiator, and it works perfect. I was going to have mine 
rebuilt, but I was doubtful as to the longevity of the dissimilar materials 
design (o-rings, plastic, etc.) , plus the all-aluminum radiator was only a 
few bucks more than a rebuild. Now if I get a leak, I can have it fixed at any 
radiator shop.The removal and install, only took 45 minutes each. Piece of 
cake, and well worth it!
