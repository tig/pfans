It is my intent at this point to put a FAQ together.  I have kept
most of the discussion of this group for a long while and try to 
put everything in some kind of order.  

I will be setting up a home page soon and will then provide the list
with the address.

The important thing now is for everyone that has done some work
on their car to write down the procedure they used and send me
a copy.  I have already tackled the timing belt and brake on my car
but I will only write procedure for thing that I have done myself...

So send me the info and I will do the compiling and upgrade...

Stephane,  I have an idea... since you're doing a technical FAQ, how 
'bout some pictures to go with it?  A picture is worth a thousand words 
right?  I mention this because my car is in a million pieces and since 
I have everything relevant taken apart, maybe it would be nice to 
supplement FAQs with jpegs.  If someone is willing to supply me with a 
digital camera, I'll do the picture taking!  Any other ideas are 
welcome, so c'mon folks, lets hear some!
