Hello folks,
This weekend I attended my first auto-x (I did not drive...) at John
C.C. White's urging.

Wow.  I've never seen that many cool cars in my life!  There must have
been 50 awe inspiring Porsches.  There even was a Lotus Super 7 (yikes
that thing could turn the cones...)

Anyway, I am going to autocross at the next one.  I will be very slow,
but hey, I'll get better.

The only depressing thing about the entire afternoon was that John and I
were the only 928's out there, and he was the only one driving.  There
has to be some other 928's (and their owners) in the northeast region
who are ready to stretch their car's legs?  Let's all go to the next one
and make our own category!  I think it is June 29th.  Go to the PCA
northeast page to find the schedule.

Anybody interested? We can't let all those aircooled guys have all of
the fun.
