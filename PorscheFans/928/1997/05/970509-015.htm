Hi again,

I have a question to all drivers of automatic 928's

Do you have fun in/with the Auto?? ...or do you wish you had
rather bought the manual version now!?  This is a SERIOUS question.

I went to an 'Advanced Drivers Ed.' day organised by the Porsche
Club of New South Wales 'PCNSW' (in Australia), unfortunately only
as a spectator (DEFINATELY participating in the next one!).
Of course all the 911's and (only) one 928, were all manuals!
Observing the course I could see how gear changing played an 
important part of driving around the track. Am I going to be able
to do all this in an Auto??

I am looking to buy an Auto version ...am I going to miss out??
Can I STILL get as much out of the auto? All I've read in 
the limited books I've found on the 928 is that the 4 speed auto is 
a well built (indestructable?) box. 

Is that correct in your experience? I note that I rarely see emails
about gearbox troubles AT ALL in the list! (if ANY!)

Looking forward to your responses!

Regards,
