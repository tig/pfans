Porsche's spec book shows that Porsche definitely did make manual
transmission 928 S4 cars in the '89 model year, and probably in all
subsequent years until the GTS came out. PCNA's dealer fact book shows only
auto S4s for '89 - '91 (they didn't bring any '92 928 cars into the US),
but this probably only refers to cars PCNA took the initiative to import.
At least hypothetically, as has been pointed out to me, individual US
buyers could have ordered '89 - '91 S4 stick cars, and others could have
imported non-US cars.

GTs have different engines and suspension parts from S4s, and they usually
have badges proclaiming their GT-ness on their rears (see my recent image
post); what does it say on your car's rear?

I don't know just now whether there is any explicit indication of GT-v.-S4
in the VIN, the M codes, or any other marking on the car beyond the rear
badge, but I've got a call into PCNA about this.
