Vince,

I've never done it, but I just got back from checking out a 78 928 that is
for sale and the CO (current owner) has removed and reinstalled the dash of
his other (not for sale) 928. I found this amazing and he explained the
procedure to me. No, the windshield doesn't have to be removed. He said that
there were like only 4 bolts that hold the dash on. He said that the whole
job was rather trivial.

BTW, he had the dash reconditioned by someone in Houston. It looks perfect.

He paid $90 bucks!
