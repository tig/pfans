Hi Terry!

You had a good model too - first of the big HP 32v !

My neighbor also had the same.  Alas he has M.S. and was forced to sell the
car, after his wife 'abandoned' him.  He was so kind as to give me a photo,
actually a polaroid, that I'm sure was very dear to him at one time or the
other.  It shows his wife sitting very prettily next to his light blue 928
S.  The focus of the picture is obviously her, with the car just barely
visible, on a warm sunny day.  I will treasure that photo also as a gift
from a dear friend.

We had talks sometimes down in the garage by my car, he reminiscing and
sometimes dreaming of outfitting a 928 with handcontrols but in reality his
disease is too far advanced now to make that practical.

I will take him for rides when the 'new' car gets here.

So yes fans, appreciate all that you have now and not just the cars...

And one last thing, Thank You all for your friendship, help, enthusiasm,
you name it.  I've found corresponding with you all extremely pleasurable
and look forward to all the posts daily, sometimes hourly!  I wish to
feature each and every one of your (928!) cars on the webpage - maybe even
start a registry.  Who knows, we might just have that newsletter/magazine
someday (with articles by Kim Crumb, DEVEK, 928 International, Autothority,
etc?).  Stephane has a monumental task ahead of him so let's do what we can
to help him get the FAQ started.

Whoops there I go again getting wordy.  Sorry for my sometimes long posts
as you know I am a nut.  I am really glad this list is around to keep us
928 fans in touch instead of maybe seeing each other on some anniversary
production date or race.

928's & 928porschefans Forever!
Phil
