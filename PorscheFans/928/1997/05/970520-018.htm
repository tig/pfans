This course is perfect for 928's.  It has a couple of good long
straights as far as I could discern.  

Speaking of springs and such, I was looking to put bilsteins all around
but I can't find them in any of my catalogues.  I couldn't find Eibach
springs either for this application.  I did see some (weltmeister?)
Heavy Duty springs in Automotion, but that was it.  I haven't gotten my
Devek catalogue yet so I don't know anything about that.  Any of you
guys have Bilsteins on an '89S4?

Who is that?
I thought that 10" was the biggest you could put on a 928.  How'd you do
that?

Cool.  I think I may enjoy the taste of 911's in the morning.  The best
part would be to see the "Real Porsche's are aircooled" shirts flying
off their backs as I scream by...

hmmm....does Callaway still make the turbo kit?  Or is Devek 6l the only
option (must save my pennies)

'89 928 S4 (you know the details already)
