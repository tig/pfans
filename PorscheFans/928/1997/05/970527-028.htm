Do you have any knowledge about driving over 1700 miles in only a couple of
days, over roads you are unfamiliar with, past police that want to stop you?

Cruise control is the best compromise, and you can still use that thing under
your right foot whenever you want, however you want.

Actually, on my way to school i pass exactly 2 blocks of speed limit above 25
miles an hour.  In my town we have 40,000 residents and 1.9 million visitors,
along with 8000 undergraduates and maybe 2000 graduate students.  Cops love
25 MPH zones.

I simply don't have the means to disregard the effects of tickets on my
insurance, and out of pocket cash for fines.  But on the other hand, I didn't
buy the car to putter around.  It still gets well used, virtually every time
I drive it.  On the long trip it got worked out all the time.  I just
couldn't go 100 mph for 1700 miles.  The mpg was welcome, especially after
getting 13 to 15 normally.

Hello All,

I know that this topic has been thoroughly discussed, but when the talk
was hot and heavy I didn't have my car so I didn't pay close enough
attention to get all of the details.  I am unhappy with the current
condition of the phone dial wheels on my 79 928 and would like to return
them to as-new condition.  I know that several of you have used the
wheel refinishing kits offered in the Eastwood catalog.  I have ordered
and received this catalog but am unsure how to proceed.  Since I just
want to restore the wheels should I just use the paint stripper?  How do
I then finish the wheels?  Is it possible to complete this job without
removing the tires?  As an aside, how do you lift the car in order to
place it on jack stands?
Thanks,
Chris Trask
