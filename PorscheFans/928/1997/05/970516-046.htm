Sorry for the mistake.  But as an 85 owner, i was hopping that I
was not too far behind the GTS mark...  I guess I need to  find
myself those 57 missing horses somehow...

uh?  I thought '84 was the year when ABS is standard!  From what I've 
learned in Brake System 101 class, :-) a vacuum leak on the booster 
will cause you more effort in braking.  The ABS system would be a 
possible culprit since the ABS system pulses the brake system when 
activated.  And this activation can be caused on purpose or by 
malfunction.  It is fair to say that not all ABS system are designed 
the same.  But your '85 doesn't have ABS.  There is a higher 
probability that you have a frozen caliper and/or piston.  I would make 
sure that the calipers are floating and that the teflon sleeves used on 
the floating pins are in good condition.  Remove the pads and slightly 
depress the brake to extend the piston a little.  Try to press the 
pistons back; you should be able to with some moderate pressure.  If 
not, then the pistons are frozen.  This is generally caused by water in 
the brake lines.  Water will accumulate in a pocket area in the caliper 
and will cause rust.

Disclaimer:  This analysis is based on my '83 928S and my wife's Volvo 
and honestly, I've NEVER worked on an '85 928' brake system before.  I 
hope this help and let us know what the results are!
