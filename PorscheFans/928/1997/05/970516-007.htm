John,
        I might be too late getting back about the lock but when you 
withdraw it your half inch or so you have to get a small screwdriver
in one side (the R.H. side for the drivers door) and prise off the 
plastic tab which connects the lock to the mechanism inside then the lock
should come out more. If you are really unlucky you will not have enough
slack in the alarm wires to take the lock all the way out and then you may
have to remove the panel inside and disconect the three way connecyor which
is sitting on TOP of the door just inside the window then the lock WILL come
out unless a former owner has welded it in place or something.
But ( I know I'm too late for this) before you do all that with the lock!!! 
you can do a check on the condition of the Alarm activating switch by
looking underneath the Dash on the drivers side where you will find a
connector with 3 wires,  if you unplug this you can do a continuity check on
it, it's a two way non latching switch so with key in Unlock pos. continuity
between common (middle wire)and one side and with key in lock pos.
continuity between common and the other side. 

good luck.
kevin
