Barry,

One of the nice things about the '89 and newer 928's is that they have a
little trip computer controlled by a stalk just below the turn signal stalk
and one of the many functions of this is to tell you EMBE...totally awesome.

See the post from Derron to find out all of the other things that this little
chip does!

Hello Everyone,

I have been experiencing some problems with my air conditioner and since
I have never worked on one before, thought that I had better ask you all
for advice.  Yesterday when I started my 79 928 I noticed a noise that I
had never heard before.  It is a repetitive thumping and I thought that
maybe the hood insulation was getting into the fan or something like
that.  Well, upon closer examination I have determined that it is the
air conditioner.  When the car is running with the air conditioner
turned off you can hear the thumping sound.  When the air conditioner is
turned on the sound goes away and is replaced by a noise similar to that
of a belt slipping only not as extreme.  Also, the air conditioner will
not always come on anymore when I try to turn it on. When I tried to
turn it on and no cool air was coming out of the duct I went and looked
at the air conditioner while the motor was running and noticed that the
clutch had not engaged.   My question is this: Do you think my problem
is the compressor or is it the magnetic clutch?   If I do need a new
compressor what do you think about a used one?  If I do need to buy a
new (rebuilt one)  do I need to go with the Bosch that is original for
78-79 or could I replace it with the Nippondenso that is for the 80-86
models (the only reason I ask this is that the later unit is about 1/2
the cost of the original.)  If I just need to replace the clutch, is
this an extremely difficult job?  Any hints?
Thanks,
Chris Trask
