        I posted this question some time ago and got some responses to look
for the switch to be on the brake pedal arm.  This is not the case for the
1978 cars, a fellow 928er (Martin) checked his 78 and told me there was no
switch and his brake lights do work.  

        So where the heck is it on the 1978's??????????


Is it a pressure sensitive switch in the brake line, or whaaaat?

Can anyone help?

        BTW - I found that Porsche still sells original checkered upholstry
for the 1978/79 928's.  Unfourtunetly it is only worth buying it to replace
pannels that are damaged in your car with that upholstry due to the
EXCESSIVLY high price of the stuff.  I got quoted..

retail $680 can for one of the back seats backings, and $540 can my price,
at this cost it would cost some one at least $3000 to do a conversion.

Although I have not heard anything on aftermarket replacments, I have found
aftermarket leather replacements, but no checkered.
