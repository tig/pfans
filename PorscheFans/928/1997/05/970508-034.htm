Hey. I own aBCD, a Seattle commercial printing company. Everyday we
production print jobs, including newsletters, from printfiles including text
and photos, quickly and conveniently FTP'd to us over the Net, from all over
the U.S. We cable the files into digital presses, show a proof, then push a
button. Piece a cake. 

If we could find someone to edit the newsletter, proof it, PostScript it,
then FTP us the final prinfiles, we could handle the printing and mailing,
naturally of course, at an outrageous price.

(My burns are still healing from the flames directed at my query about '90
928S4 slope antennas and the impact from car wash services. Seems you
meticulous 928 fanatics all carefully wash and wax your 928s by hand. (Of
course, using only cleanly pressed, laundered, and perfumed towels,
Naturally, you dry them only with hair blowdryers carefully set to minimum
heat. :-)
