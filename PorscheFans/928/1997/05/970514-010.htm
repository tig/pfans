To recap the drama so far, Porsche started making 928 GT cars for model
year 1989 while continuing to make 928 S4 cars. Even though the majority of
'89+ S4 cars, particularly US cars, have automatic transmission, it does
not appear to be true that stick = GT.

There also appears to be some fuzziness about badges on the rear of the
cars, in that some say nothing, and at least one other (Phil Tong's pet)
says both. (By the way, I apologize to those of you who, like James
Renfrew, are not currently equipped to decode and view JPEG image files
attached to e-mail. We have been warned by the listmaster not to post
images and I should have followed that direction. Who wants to volunteer a
piece of a Web page to contain these images, at least for a while?)

So, many of us have decided that we want to know how to tell whether a 928
with manual transmission for model year '89 or higher is an S4 or a GT. I
think I've now got the info straight on this burning question, so here it is:

1. If the rear of the car has a badge saying "928 GT", you're probably there

2. The VIN doesn't tell you. It appears that all US cars, GT or S4, have a
"6" before the four digit serial number at the end of the VIN; cars for the
rest of the world have a "4" there.

3. The M codes (the three digit codes found on the sticker under the mat in
the trunk) will, according to PCNA, tell you; code 639 means "GT".

4. The eight-character engine number will tell you. A typical number for an
S4 engine from MY '89 would be 81K00001, which decodes as follows:
	8 = eight cylinder engine
	1 = S4 worldwide; if this character is "5", you've got a GT (engine, at
least)
	K = model year 1989
	00001 = serial number; range up to 99999 (ha!)

5. The engine type will tell you. S4 stick cars have engine type M 28.41,
S4 auto cars have engine type M 28.42, while GT cars (always stick) have
engine type M 28.47.

That's it. I'd be delighted if those with GTs and those who aren't sure
what they've got (Hi, Matt!) would check out these markings con their cars
and report the results to the list.
