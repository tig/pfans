Hi everyone-
  Today I was looking at the hatch motors, and I was looking at the bottom of
the assembly,(if you stood at the back of the car and looked down while the
hatch was open), and I saw two bronze colored screws. I then took one of the
wrenchs from the tool kit in the trunk and moved them down. It worked and now
the trunk opens like it is supposed to. Hope this helps anyone who has had
the same problem I have had. If you need more detail of this email me and I
will get it to you.

Thanks,

matt
