The knob is "capped" with a plastic button.  I used a well-worn 1.5 
inch putty knife and pried it off from the edge.

You would do the usual; remove shift boot, base plate, etc...  Then I 
removed the lever from the shift assembly and put it on a vise.  Took a 
hacksaw and just went for it. You'll be wasting your time if your 
hacksaw blade is dull.  Spend $1.59 and get a new one.  Use a rat tail 
file to notch the top just like the stock and you're in business.

Now, the length that you want to hack off is really personal 
preference.  Just keep in mind that the shorter the lever, the more 
effort the throw.  (duhh... its the principle of leverage, ya know!)  I 
found 2.5 inches off is comfortable for me.  Like Steve said, after the 
mod, it'll take more effort to shift, but you'll get used to it in a 
few miles.  In a few months, you'll find that your right biceps are 
more symetrical to your left one for a change!  

This is also a good opportunity to do some greasing during re-assembly. 
"While you're there"... check for excess play on the linkage coupler.  
If your 928 have some serious mileage on it like mine does, you just 
might be surprised! (..now, that's another thread.. but don't say I 
didn't warn you!)  Took me about an hour.  The only thing that still 
bugs me about the whole shifting geometry is that the shifter is NOT 
spring loaded in neutral; because I use second gear from a standstill.  
I've heard that Porsche changed it to load in neutral in later models.  
I would be interested in hearing somebody out there that MIGHT have a 
mod for this.

By the way, I think Steve's shift kit really sounds like the "right" 
way to go.  Steve, if you're still with us, how 'bout sending out some 
more info, price, availability, ease of install, etc.?   I'm 
interested...

Have fun.. I did!
