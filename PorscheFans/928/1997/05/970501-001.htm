G,Day Porsche Fans!

First, introductions..my name is Leonard Zech

I live in Sydney Australia (i know you wont hold that against me! ;^p)
and my dream car is (of course) the 928S..!!! Why else would I be here!!

Do you folks remember the porschephiles web site?? I used to enjoy that
mail list and I'm happy to say I now (prefer) enjoy this list as well!!

Reading something Scott 'speed racer' was saying about the colour
of his 928 (ohh LURVE those numbers!!) 928!!! <sigh> reminds me
of a 928S I ALMOST bought. The colour was called "Tabac Metallic"
and a B E A U T I F U L ! colour it was too!! A deep almost caramel-
gold tone with the 'unusual' 70's geometric pattern inserts in the brown
tan leather seats..it was truly a lovely looking car (from afar!)
Pity the car was neglected by many an inept owner, at least 8 in the 
log book and no doubt many more.

So..maybe one day I'll find it, take it apart and LOVINGLY restore it
to its original beauty!
 
Well maybe I'll talk some more later about the 928 scene DownUnder.
Im a member of the Porsche Club of New South Wales (PCNSW) but they're
mostly into air cooled ( sad sad people :^> )

Regards,

Leonard Zech
