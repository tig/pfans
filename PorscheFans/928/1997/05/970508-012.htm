  I that made that promise, so I just called Amsoil.
  
  They have an oiled foam air filter for the 928.  The filter
  model number is S-1503.  According to the tech person I just
  spoke with, this model will fit all model years (at least
  through '94 - his book didn't list '95).
  
  Beware - I have one of these filters on my wife's MB, and it
  looks a lot different than a stock or K&N filter.  There was
  no "frame" around the filter as was found in the original, but
  rather a wire mesh that prevents the filter from deforming.
