If you turn both sides the same, you'll be no worse off than when you
started.  Just count carefully.

Thanks, quite right - too casual thinking on this one.  Pretty sure the
design is the bump stops and not the wheel wells if we're talking about
factory shocks.

I'm pretty sure those that I mentioned are the only ones that change - I
measured rear toe versus height using a jack to raise the car and it
doesn't change.  Caster shouldn't change either unless your lower
control arm bushings are really worn.  (How I measure toe is pretty fun
- if people want to know (and are willing to buy 2 lasers) I can write
that up.)

Thanks for the correction on the bump stops.  For the original posting,
no doubt the inferior handling is due to the old shocks.

Best,
Kurt

Actually, I do not have an electric fan on my 928S.  It did crossed my 
mind in installing one though...  but couldn't justify doing it because 
I am happy with my 928S as-is.  My last experience in electric fan goes 
way back when I owned an '73 SD-455 Trans Am.  Don't remember what make 
but it is estimated that the stock fan chew up about 1-2 hp.
