You are hanging around with the right crowd here.  To make those dreams and
wishes reality, get the car roadworthy then accept Devek's open invitation
to join them at any one of the numerous events - dyno sessions, track, road
racing.  They're traveling to the Silver State in Nevada as we speak (and
so would I if I had my dang road car).

There seems to be only two 1/4 milers here and I for one would like to see
another 928 on the dragstrip.  The drag race experience is sharp and
intense even as time seems to stretch and warp as the tree counts down to
launch.

From what I've read you're doing, I'd be surprised if it wasn't ready by
the end of this year - you seem to be ready for the challenges that are
ahead, only vehicle prep stands in the way.


But everyday, I crave that power and it is

I don't mean to post blasphemous materials here but grab a copy of Turbo &
Hi Tech mag, or Sports Compact Car, and inside will be modified Honda's
etc. that are more than enough to do the job you crave.  There's nothing
wrong with enthusiasm for many car types, nor with having multiple
projects!

Maybe I will buy a 944 S (do they need a
> space Phil?)

Only a half-space  ;)

Woof!
Phil
