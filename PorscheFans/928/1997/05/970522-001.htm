In response to the "Technical Stuff" note from (J Renfrew):

I do think that 928's were built in 1992, but didn't go on sale in the US
until 1993. My car came on the road in May 1992. (of course it may have
been produce in 1991....)

For production numbers have a look at
http://www.pcapotomac.org/porschetalk; I have Cut and Pasted some
production numbers:

QUOTE
The only information I have got (in brackets my source of information): 
Total 928: 61,000 (up to 1/7/96; 911 & Porsche World) 
1995: 312 (Christophorus 1/96) 
1996: 28 (Christophorus 1/97) 

From PNA the numbers are: Total 928's = 25101 (I think is US sales only).
GTS models = 301 (Same as above). BTW, there was one GTS Automatic and two
GTS 5-speeds sold in 1996, making them the last new 928's. 

In the December, 1996, "Market Report" article he wrote in "Excellence"
magazine, Porsche expert Bruce Anderson states the total 928 production run
was 66,000 vehicles, to include all variations. He adds that about 100 GTS
models were sold in the U.S. in each model year, 1992-1995.
