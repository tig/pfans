Hi Dean,

You must get your fingers slap another time as, if your car is US
SPEC, the 85 is a 928 S (Make sure you put the space between the
928 and the S or someone might slap your fingers again :-0)

Anyway, The US spec 928 S all had 4 valves per cylinder.  If you are
not sure, open the hood and the intake manifold should say
so.  If I am not mistaken, the ROW (rest of the world) had still
the 16 valves engine (but with higher compression) until mid 86.
This is when the 87 model was introduce as an S4.  The four stands
for the fourth redesign.  This one is confusing as the car was design
for 78 (#1) ?? (#2) 85 (#3) and 86.5 (#4).  My info on this is purely
guesswork.

Anyway, welcome to the group and be happy you got the best 928 possible!
The glorious 85 928 S.
