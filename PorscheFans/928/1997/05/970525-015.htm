That's weird, I found the lows lacking and the highs great, also with
90/130's.... What kind of lens are you using?  I have 7" flat lead crystal
lenses from Great Britain (I think).  Also, make sure they are adjusted
properly - you might be throwing light away...  

There's always the 100/140's too 
:)
