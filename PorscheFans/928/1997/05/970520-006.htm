Hey gang,

Had my first bad experience with another 928 driver the other day.  I was
leaving the bank in my beautiful dunkelblau '88 S4 and saw a Red 87-88 S4
pulling in so I pulled back around and waited for them...they drove right
by....I pulled out and got behind them and then pulled up along side at the
stop light...two women (maybe girls, maybe I should say children) in the car
and I rolled my window down to give them a card for my mechanic and one of my
business cards to let them know that we have a 928 owners group here in
Austin, TX and we would love to have them come out and join us sometime...

The bitches would not even roll their window down!! I could not believe it!
 So stuck up they actually thought I was either trying to pick them up or was
going to try and rob them or what?!

So next time you see a Porsche (especially a 928 in the Austin area) with a
Baylor sticker on the back be fore warned that if the driver is female she is
probably a stuck up snob sorority bitch from Baylor and unless you can prove
your breeding she will ignore you!

Hope I never run over them..er into them again.

James
