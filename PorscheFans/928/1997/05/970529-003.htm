This might be caused by low fluid level in the transmission.

There are aftermarket valves for first gear launches for your quite high
production volume MB transmission. I don't remember the source. Devek,
928 International or a MB specialist?

Here's some relevant info I looked up in the digests:

The secondary kickdown button for the automatic:

It sure adds a magnitude of fun to the fun-factor. About 10 minutes ago,
while
commuting to work, I found that I can use the button at the moment I go
into a
turn and "play" the throttle through the curve, nailing it as I exit.
Looked up
and saw a cop sitting at the light behind me on the street I'd just
turned onto.
He _was_ watching me, but I guess he thought I had things under control
(or was
too busy to harrass)

It's nice to be in the optimal gear at the push of a button.

Now I'm trying to decide if I want to wire this new footswitch in
parallel
with the original button.

Piece of cake.

I used a footswitch from a guitar effect. There are other appliances,
such as
sewing machines or dictation recorders, that use momentary contact push
button
footswitches. You _could_ just go to Radio Shak [sic] and get a tiny
project
box and momentary pushbutton and mount your button in that box. Get some
zip
cord.  Give yourself a few feet of zip cord to work with. Solder a
connector
of the footswitch to one side of the zip cord and the other connector to
the
other side of the zip cord.

Unplug the connector at the kickdown switch. Its a female end which
accepts
the two prongs of the switch. I found two bolts which had the correct
outer
diameter (same size as the prongs of the switch) and wrapped a piece of
zip
cord wire around the heads of each bolt and then shrink-wrapped them. 
Electrical tape will do. Just make sure that the heads of the bolts
don't
contact each other. The bolts I used had very tiny heads. You could
hacksaw 
off the heads if you were concerned about interference. Slide these
bolts into
the female connector and doublecheck that everything is well insulated
from
contacting anything else.

There you have it. The button under the gas pedal is now defunct. Your
new
footswitch has taken its place and is convienently positioned on the
left
kickpanel. I used velcro. Nothing is permenantly altered. In a pinch,
all could
be reverted to stock.
