        I'm kind of a HI-FI sterio GUY.  I'm planning a rather LARGE sterio
to put in my 1978 928.  I have all and more of the components I want, it's
just all about desciding on what will work best and take up the least space,
in a car that really has no extra for sterio installations.  So far I've
come to the following conclusions, A: I plan to run a Pioneer DEH-M990
DSP(top of the line Pioneer in 1994 with surround sound) into a Yamaha 12
band EQ with dual RCA preamp imputs, then my Sony XR-7180 full logic tape
player into the Yamaha(also with AUX imputs incase I want to maybe run a LCD
monitor in the future).  I plan to mount the Pioneer in the dash, the Sony
on the "crap tray" on the passenger side lower dash, and the Yamaha EQ to
the side of the console pannel on the drivers side for easy access. 
        Then for speakers, the EQ will drive 1 Sherwood 4ch amp 250watts X 4
to run ALL of the cab speakers, which will have independant X-over's on each
speaker, and my specialty built high efficiency LearJet amp 1000watts X 2 to
run bridged into my custom built 12" subwoofer (lamanated dual cones paper
and aluminum, with a 4" voice coil, 160 oz magnet and a vertually unlimited
power handling due to the aluminum cone).  The subwoofer I have decided to
give up my spare tire cavaty (since I don't have the pump and am more
inclined to call a flat bed tow truck) and install it flat to the carpet
there, giving no loss of the rear window view.  For cab speakers I'm not to
shure what brands yet but have decided on criteria.  For the door speakers,
the top door speaker is probably the most important speaker in the entire
car, because it has the most direct shot at you the listener.  So, with that
in mind this speaker should have the most spent on it for the best fidelity,
I'd highly reccomend a coaxil speaker (if you also don't want to have
separate tweeters) and pretty much any speaker that would fit and part of
JBL's GTS series, you really do get what you pay for!  Me I want
tremendously sharp sound so that demands that I must use a "satelight"
tweeter, which means one that stands alone from a speaker.  For this job I
would highly recommend MB quart QM 25.01 HX tweeters.  For the lower door
speakers you can actually fit a MAX of a 6" speaker in there, but this is
the MAX.  The lower door speaker should focus mainly on midrange because it
is too low to affect the high range of listening.  For this task I reccomend
a Focal 5" midrange.  You may have not heard of Focal but they encorporate
extreem sofistication in there speakers, such as kevlar cones, or multiple
neodyminium magnet subwoofers and I have all of their products to be of
excellent quallity.
For my 1978 that takes care of all speakers up front but there is still the
two in the back of the car by the windows.  This is probably the best
position for the rear speakers in the car.  This is so because the sound can
easily reflect off the glass and disspurs into the cab.  For this speaker I
would highly recomend a coaxil speaker, don't worry about extra tweeters for
the back, you might have not though it by how I go on but extra tweeters in
the back is over kill.  I have no recomendations on what to put in the back
but would recomend AGAINST any, Pioneer, Kenwood, Clarion, Blaupunk, or
Alpine speaker of this smaller size.  These manufactures don't tend to make
a good preforming speaker of this size, and I don't want to see a cheap
speaker(s) in a 928.  Hope it wasn't all too much for you guys.  Over all if
you are looking for a good sounding system for a reasonable buck then I's
turn your head to JL audio equipent.  JL has in my opinion the best bang for
the buck, and is probably the leader by quite some distance too!
        If you have any inparticular questions about what I said,
manufactures of audio equipment or a certain product you can drop me a line
and I'll let you know my 2 cents worth.


                        That's       my      $10.00  WORTH
