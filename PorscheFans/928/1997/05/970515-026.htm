This would be great!! You could fishout the information very easily, 
print a copy to bring next to the car and not care it it got dirty.
They will probably not offer the 928 book :-(

Well Wes, you have to remember the year of some of these vehicle.  Today
a red car is very common but in the early to mid 80's they were not
as common...

You should start to save and get the Chartreuse 928 with the green
and purple interior.  It might still be leather but no-one would
think your car was either common or borring...(some might think it is
discussting...)

92 Acura Integra RS (Red with black material interior ....
91 Honda Civic SE (White with blue material interior ....

PS. Not offended by the comments but could have been said in a nicer
tone ;-)  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, or something...
