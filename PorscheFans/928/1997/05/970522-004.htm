No? Tell that to airplane drivers who have a mixture control and exhaust 
temperature gauge right in front of them. But don't have catalytic 
converters.

Mixture can be even more critical with the catalytic converter as the 
excess gasoline gets burned in the cat, making it hotter.

Sam says he can't get any voltage out of an "air sensor?" Maybe I'm not 
awake yet but the only air sensor I can think of is on the FI intake. Maybe 
he means the oxygen sensor on the exhaust?  I'd agree that's the most 
likely problem. Don't have the URL handy but a GM F-body web site has 
excellent info on how to test O2 sensors with a propane torch.
