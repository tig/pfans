Phil,

Re:  Your neighbor w/ MS.

I know that this disease has many manifestations and can effect people
differently, but I just wanted to encourage you to encourage him that a 928
and a wheel chair can coexist, as you well know from visiting my web site!!

I personally use removeable hand controls so I do not have to cut or mess up
the dash on my car.  I have a friend from the race track who uses the more
permanently attached hand controls in a '95 993 tiptronic...this guy flies
around the track.  He is way faster then I but I can hold my own within my
run group that is for sure.  One important thing is to get a wheelchair that
folds up real small like the new Quickie Designs "Revolution".  The chair is
a bit heavy so I just leave it in the car all the time unless I am getting
out somewhere other than home, and use my Titanium light weight for everyday
use.

Hope that helps and maybe gives a bit of inspiration to your friend.
