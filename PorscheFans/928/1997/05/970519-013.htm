Congratulations!

In fact, they went out of their way to do so. If Corvette can sell a pale
imitation and Ferrari can sell extremely expensive similar cars, Porsche
could certainly be selling 928 cars right now if it chose to.

No, don't. The only oil additives on which you can rely are those put there
by the manufacturers of quality oils. This list, along with others, has
carried many messages all pointing out that Porsche AG is not so dumb or
narrow-minded not to have tested anything which might be of value. Sorry,
but this is just not good advice, particularly in a car with a big,
powerful, high-revving engine which costs a lot to repair when bearings fail.

>keep those 928's running forever!

This is best done by following the manufacturer's recommendations, which
translate to a good 20W50 oil changed every 3000 miles. Dino oil's fine,
but many of use prefer to use synthetics (I like Amsoil Series 2000) and
find improved freedom of revving and cooler running.
