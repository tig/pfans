Howdy '28ers!  I have really enjoyed lurking around this group the last few
days. I just bought a lovely '88 928 S4 with a scant 30K on the clock, and am
in the process going through the car mechanically from top to bottom.  I plan
to do most of the work myself, but I'm having the shop replace the camshaft
timing belt today because it is original and making me nervous.

I have been told that I need new motor mounts.  Has anyone replaced these
puppies themselves?  It was pretty easy replacing them on my previous Porsche
(Turbo Carrera), but I have no service manual yet for the 928.

The 928 is my fourth Porsche, and although quite a different experience from
the 911 derivatives, I am very impressed with it.  I don't understand why the
928 generally doesn't get the respect it deserves (vis-a-vis the 911), but at
the price I paid for my virtually new car, who cares?  I'm looking forward to
some serious track time with the POC and PCA.

Thanks for the contributions to the group, I really look forward to it each
day.
