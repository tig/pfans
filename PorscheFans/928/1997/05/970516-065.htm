Hey Jack, where are you from?  You are the first one I notice that put
an accent
om my name!!  You just won...many thanks ;-)

Seriously, I have bled the brake using about 1 liter of Castrol GTLMA. 
I thought
this was enough but apparently not.  So I started again and the fluid
appears to be
cleaning up.  I will try to blead them a few time in the next few week
to try the
cleaning action (good piece of advice) then, if I still have problem, I
will try
1. taking all the calipers apart and checking them out
2. chaging the brake master cylinder
3. remove the brake altogether and put hole on the floor of the car...
