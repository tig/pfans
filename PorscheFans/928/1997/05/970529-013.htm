Greetings all...cruising around town today I spotted a black 928 at a body
shop.  I went in to take a look at it.  The folks (mom & pop shop) had
owned the car for 2 years, and their brother in law had it for 1 year
prior.  They don't know the history of the car before that.  It had a few
unusual features, and I wonder if these indicate that it's a euro version: 
The car is in rough shape cosmetically, and they couldn't get the hood open
(broken cable release) for me to get the engine #, but here's what I found.
 I'm looking for an 87+, but I thought it'd be interesting to know more
about this one.  here goes:

VIN:  92881010249
turn signals fore and aft of front wheels
dual exhaust exiting on left side (as viewed from rear)
spoiler(not S4 type)
no bumperettes
red light ~ 4" x 4" just to the left of the tags (euro fog light??)
missing knob by the handbrake
all writing on instruments in german.

I forget the mileage....the interior was in pretty rough shape....some
hideous brown cloth. they are asking $4k.  BUT, since I was there, I
decided to take it for a spin....started right up, idled smoothly...shifted
into gear smoothly, but MAN is the steering heavy...all 928s like this??? 
Anyway, after puttering around the neighborhood for a bit I went on the
freeway...I found the performance to be lackluster...the old Jag would run
circles around it.  Not what I was expecting from a 300 horse motor. (of
course it might not be). All in all though, the car felt VERY solid.  Oh
yeah, it's a 79 928S ( 928 S) Woof !! According to the guy, but he has so
little info about it I'm not sure if he knows what he's got.  What do y'all
think????

Dzokayi
89 Jaguar XJ-S (please buy it so I can get my 928)
