For those of you that have recently started 928 websites, BRAVO!!  But I was
wondering if it didn't make more sense to coordinate your efforts in order to
have  better overall coverage, and less resources used up in the process?  I
would certainly, at the very least, like to see all the members of the list
link their sites to all the others (so that I can find them all).  I would
also wonder about putting links of all sites on the pfans site?  Any
comments?  I still haven't scanned my pics, or had them scanned for me, but
will forward on as soon as they are done.

Good luck to all,

Brian Robinson
